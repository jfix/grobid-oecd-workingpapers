			<p>With globalization and the co-incident shift towards a knowledge-based economy, the link between<lb/> entrepreneurship policy and innovation has received renewed attention. By underpinning firm creation<lb/> and firm expansion entrepreneurship policies strengthen innovation, increasing productivity in the<lb/> enterprise sector. In return, policies fostering innovation will tend to spur firm creation as the results of<lb/> R&amp;D are commercialized. Many countries have taken initiatives since early 2000 to test the potential of<lb/> entrepreneurship and SME policies, articulating these with an innovation-oriented policy approach.<lb/> This report consists of a synthesis report based on four country case studies on the role of<lb/> entrepreneurship policies in supporting innovation in Korea, Mexico, Norway and Turkey.

By underpinning firm creation and firm expansion entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> will strengthen innovation, while policies fostering innovation will tend to spur firm creation, as the<lb/> results of R&amp;D are commercialised.<lb/></figure>

			<p>With globalisation and the co-incident shift towards a knowledge-based economy, this link has<lb/> come under renewed attention. Interest in entrepreneurship policy has flourished as a consequence, with<lb/> many countries taking new initiatives to test its potential. 2 Aware of these potential benefits, in the early<lb/> 2000s many countries have undertaken a systematic review of entrepreneurship and SME policies,<lb/> shifting towards an innovation-oriented programme approach. Among the countries moving in this<lb/> direction were Korea, Mexico, Norway and Turkey. This synthesis report attempts to assess these<lb/> countries&apos; new policies from an international perspective, hopefully enriching the international debate<lb/> about the co-dependence of entrepreneurial activity (firm creation and firm expansion) and innovation.<lb/> This synthesis report consists of three parts. The first part highlights main features of the four<lb/> countries&apos; business sector and identifies principal impediments to entrepreneurial activity. The second<lb/> part presents different policy approaches seeking to stimulate entrepreneurial and innovative activities.<lb/> The third and final part evaluates entrepreneurship and SME policies in the light of national adjustment<lb/> requirements and international best-practice experience.<lb/> 1<lb/> <ref type="biblio">OECD (2005)</ref>, SME and Entrepreneurship Outlook and A.N. <ref type="biblio">Hoffmann (2007)</ref>, A General Framework for<lb/> Entrepreneurship Policy Review.<lb/></p>

			<p>Entrepreneurship policy is usually defined as aiming at the pre-start, start up and post-start up phase of the<lb/> entrepreneurial process. Its primary aim is to boost innovation and productivity growth and to make<lb/> entrepreneurship a viable option for professional development. This calls for a set of organic conditions<lb/> favouring people&apos;s access to the nascent pre-start phase with consequent moves into the infancy and early<lb/> stages of new firms.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation<lb/> 1.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Reflecting population size, the number of enterprises differs sharply across the four countries.<lb/> Mexico with far the highest population has the highest number of firms in the formal economy (about 4<lb/> million enterprises). At the other extreme is Norway with about 350 000 firms. Enterprise intensity<lb/> (enterprise per capita) is strong for Norway and Korea, but low for Mexico and Turkey (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The<lb/> difference, though, is mainly fictional as large numbers of Mexico&apos;s and Turkey&apos;s enterprises operate in<lb/> the informal economy. Adjusting for this bias raises the &apos;enterprise intensity&apos; of both Mexico and<lb/> Turkey close to levels observed in Korea and Norway. On the other hand, Mexico and Turkey have by<lb/> far the highest regional dispersion of per-capita GDP in the OECD area, calling for strong region-<lb/>oriented entrepreneurship and SME policies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Common to the four countries under review is a high degree of SME-predominance (less<lb/> than 250 employees). 3 In each of the four countries, SMEs accounted for more than 99% of<lb/> the total business population (total formal economy). While similar measures of<lb/> preponderance are noted for manufacturing (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>), the structure of firm size is vastly<lb/> different. Manufacturing micro firms (less than 10 employees) strongly dominate in Mexico<lb/> and Turkey (exceeding 90% of manufacturing firms). This compares with a share of only<lb/> 50% for Korea and of 60% for Norway. Moreover, small firms (10-49 employees) display a<lb/> much stronger presence in Korea (42% of SMEs) and Norway (nearly 30%) than in Mexico<lb/> and Turkey (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Large firms are strongly represented in Norway and weakly so in<lb/> Turkey.<lb/></p>

			<p>The relative productive efficiency of different SME categories can be gauged by dividing<lb/> the output share by the respective firm population share. The implicit efficiency ratios<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) show the customary positive correlation between firm size and efficiency levels<lb/> (three tiers of efficiency). In the four countries under consideration, large manufacturing<lb/> firms (representing around 1% of the firm population) produce between one-half and three-<lb/>quarters of manufacturing output, the highest output share being indicated for Mexico (74%)<lb/> and the lowest for Norway (49%).<lb/> In contrast, micro firms, though dominant in terms of firm population, account for only a<lb/> small portion of manufacturing output ranging from 4% for Mexico to 7% for Norway. The<lb/> implied efficiency ratio is particularly low for Mexico and Turkey. On the other hand, Mexico<lb/> and Turkey&apos;s medium-sized firms (MSEs) in manufacturing concentrated in metropolitan areas<lb/> record high efficiency ratios; this could be the sign of a successful integration of these<lb/> companies into the global economy.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 3.

			<p>Overall, the spectrum of efficiency ratios across manufacturing SME categories is much larger<lb/> for Mexico and Turkey than for Korea and Norway. The highly polarised profile of productivity<lb/> levels by size class is typical of countries with a large number of subsistence entrepreneurs and a<lb/> corresponding lack of efficient growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity. For this mismatch to<lb/> narrow, a &apos;bottom-up convergence&apos; of productivity levels needs to take place, allowing Mexico and<lb/> Turkey&apos;s small and micro firms to catch up with high-income countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Business start ups (a proxy of entrepreneurial activity) tend to shift resources from inefficient to<lb/> innovative firms enhancing gains in aggregate firm productivity. 4 The productivity effects are<lb/> particularly strong in high-tech industries, where start ups are vibrant. For Norway,<lb/> FORA indicators 5 show high business start-up rates for most categories of SMEs, backed by wide-<lb/>spread entrepreneurial education, high bankruptcy recovery rates and, more recently, by new<lb/> legislation on the taxation of dividends (2006). Bankruptcy recovery rates are also high in Korea<lb/> where unified bankruptcy laws and improved re-start possibilities contribute to rapid firm turn-over.<lb/> Survival rates of newly created Mexican firms appear to have risen over the past few years. This<lb/> could be a consequence of the more intensive use of business incubators.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Selected factors driving firm creation and expansion<lb/></head>

			<p>The concepts of entrepreneurship and firm creation are closely related. 6 New firms and<lb/> associated innovations tend to spring up from the interplay of three principal factors: Opportunity,<lb/> skills and resources. Opportunities are created by market conditions and expectations. Skills include<lb/> the ability of entrepreneurs and their access to business advice, while resources comprise access to<lb/> capital, R&amp;D and technology. From the entrepreneur&apos;s perspective, these three factors drive firm<lb/> 4<lb/> S. Scarpetta, P.Hemmings, T. Tressel and J. <ref type="biblio">Woo (2002)</ref>, &quot;The Role of Policy and Institutions for<lb/> Productivity and Firm Dynamics.

			<head>6<lb/></head>

			<p>Innovation can be fuelled from external sources to the firm, but one should also take into account the<lb/> internal sources (in-house), which are often a main source of innovation activity. Some aspects of<lb/> entrepreneurship policies, such as building internal capability through skills development, is therefore a<lb/> key resource for both new and existing enterprises.<lb/> creation. 7 Even so, a hostile regulatory framework and adverse cultural attitudes may hinder firm<lb/> creation.<lb/> Market conditions and the regulatory framework are key determinants of entrepreneurship, but<lb/> are not treated thoroughly in these case studies. This is the case for instance for bankruptcy<lb/> legislation. The outline of the case studies is largely based upon major determinants of<lb/> entrepreneurship excluding market conditions and the regulatory framework. These determinants of<lb/> entrepreneurial activity can be seen as potential areas for entrepreneurship policy:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Resources: access to technology 8 and finance.<lb/> • Skills: capabilities and access to skilled labour.<lb/> • Cultural factors.<lb/> • Opportunities (market conditions): not treated in the case studies.<lb/> • Regulatory framework: not treated in the case studies. 9<lb/> a)<lb/> Access to new technology, including ICT<lb/></table>

			<p>ICT plays a central role in the interplay between entrepreneurial policy and innovative activity. Wide<lb/> ICT diffusion can ease the creation and expansion of business support centres ( &quot; service stations &quot; ). It<lb/> facilitates network building, data collection and information exchange among service stations of the same<lb/> kind as well as among different support units. The result is often a finessed, synergetic programme<lb/> approach apt to respond more adequately to specific needs of different business categories.<lb/> On the demand side, ICT raises the visibility of programme support stimulating their take-up,<lb/> especially by small and micro firms. ICT thus improves supply as well as demand conditions for business<lb/> support services and represents a major tool of entrepreneurship and SME policies. Within the business<lb/> sector, ICT and e-business applications provide further benefits across a wide range of intra-and inter-firm<lb/> processes and transactions, including the internationalisation of SME activities. 10<lb/> ICT also impacts directly upon two principal intervention areas of entrepreneurship and SME policies.<lb/> In the financial sector, rising ICT diffusion enhances banks&apos; credit assessment capacity and augments the<lb/> transparency of data on firm performance and credit conditions. By kindling competition among financial<lb/> institutions ICT helps ease barriers to finance, with a consequent fall in bank lending rates for SMEs<lb/> relative to benchmark interest rates (interest rate convergence).<lb/> In the domain of skilled labour, ICT and related basic training courses for would-be and actual<lb/> entrepreneurs favours the absorption of non-R&amp;D based innovations. In schools, universities and research<lb/> centres, ICT is an indispensable tool for spreading the values of entrepreneurial education. Overall, ICT<lb/> makes entrepreneurship and SME policies more effective, spurring both entrepreneurial activity and<lb/> innovative momentum.<lb/> 7<lb/> A.N. <ref type="biblio">Hoffmann (2007)</ref>, A General Framework for Entrepreneurship Policy Review.<lb/></p>

			<head>ICT Diffusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Broadly in line with income levels, countries differ widely in the diffusion of information and<lb/> communication technology and in R&amp;D intensity. All indicators point to a weak ICT diffusion in Mexico<lb/> and Turkey, representing fractional values of the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In both countries,<lb/> exceptionally high prices for using ICT aggravate the effect from low income levels. Looking at individual<lb/> ICT indicators, though, reveals some noteworthy differences. While Turkey has stronger fixed telephone<lb/> access paths, cellular mobiles and broadband access than Mexico, the opposite is true of Internet<lb/> subscribers to fixed networks. ICT diffusion also varies with the size of firms. In terms of Internet access,<lb/> Turkey&apos;s large firms have recently reached parity with the European Union. Korea&apos;s diffusion of ICT<lb/> surpasses OECD averages in all areas, signifying a strong ICT presence, especially considering its below-<lb/>average income position (80% of OECD per capita income). Norway&apos;s above-average performance is in<lb/> tune with its high-income level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transmission of public R&amp;D<lb/></head>

			<p>The transmission of public R&amp;D benefits to private business is weak in Korea, Mexico and Turkey.<lb/> This mainly reflects mismatches between industry needs and research routes followed by universities and<lb/> public research institutions. Weak collaborative links between academia and the business sector seem to<lb/> underlie this dichotomy.<lb/> In Korea, only one tenth of public R&amp;D funds is directly allocated to SMEs. High private R&amp;D<lb/> spending is strongly concentrated in large firms (nearly 80%) operating in two sectors (ICT and<lb/> automobiles, nearly 50%). The resultant innovations are mostly product innovations 11 . Overall, judging by<lb/> the low output of codified knowledge in the form of patents and publications, Korea may not enjoy the full<lb/> benefits from sizeable R&amp;D spending. In Turkey, the co-operation between academia, public institutions<lb/> and industry is inadequate, notwithstanding a significant rise in the number of Turkish scientists&apos;<lb/> publications. Most Turkish R&amp;D employees work for universities as distinct from research centres. In<lb/> 11 OECD (2007), Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard.<lb/> Mexico, transmission links, though still insufficient, have recently improved with the strong build-up of<lb/> business incubators and innovation laboratories.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both Korea and Norway display average degrees of SMEs collaborating in innovation activities<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). For both countries, OECD Scoreboard 2007data point to a scale of collaboration of only half of<lb/> that recorded in Denmark and Sweden. Only a quarter of Norway&apos;s enterprises conducted innovation-<lb/>related activities in 2002-2004. Comparable data for Mexico and Turkey do not exist.<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> Access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Bank credit and venture capital are important for firm creation and innovation. Barriers to finance<lb/> affect disproportionally small and micro firms, often due to lack of collateral. 12 Bank lending rates thus<lb/> tend to be high for small and micro firms. Start-ups of small innovative firms also confront difficulties in<lb/> accessing risk capital. Mexico, Turkey, and to a lesser extent Korea and Norway, are no exception to this<lb/> pattern.<lb/> Largely in tune with their income position, efficiency levels of financial markets (as measured by net<lb/> interest margins and total loans to private sector and securities market capitalisation in per cent of GDP)<lb/> also vary strongly across countries. 13 Mexico and Turkey both combine extremely high net interest margins<lb/> with extremely low loan/GDP ratios (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), pointing to difficult access to finance for smaller firms. In<lb/> both countries, low ICT penetration reduces competitive pressure in banking services and may also impact<lb/> the capacity of credit risk assessment, especially in the domain of small-scale lending. The opposite (lower<lb/> margins and higher &apos;loan/</p>

			<table>GDP ratios&apos;) is noted for Korea and Norway.<lb/> 12<lb/> OECD (2006), The SME Financing Gap.<lb/> 13<lb/> OECD (2006), Going for Growth.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></table>

But, in addition, they imply a particularly wide dispersion of firm-size related lending rates<lb/> around the high average (sharp asymmetry of effective lending rates). Comparative cost disadvantages for<lb/> small and micro firms thus tend to be much larger in low-income countries than in high-income countries.<lb/> In Mexico, for example, costly suppliers&apos; credits account for as much as two-thirds of finance for small<lb/> enterprises. In Turkey, only around 5% of available bank credit is provided to industrial SMEs, which<lb/> account for no less than 99.5% of all industrial establishments. In both countries, a broad financial<lb/> infrastructure for micro firms is inexistent. In contrast, EU-based SMEs meet about four-fifths of their<lb/> financing needs through bank finance.<lb/> Stringent collateral requirements are another source of financing difficulties. According to FORA data<lb/> (2007), obtaining a bank loan without collateral is difficult in Korea, but easier in Norway. In Turkey,<lb/> small firms view collateral requirements imposed by commercial banks as the most important barrier to<lb/> finance, 14 far exceeding problems posed by high interest rates. In Mexico, banks&apos; propensity to lend to<lb/> SMEs has been damped, until recently, by inadequate rules for recovering guarantees.<lb/></p>

			<p>Business start-ups based upon innovations require special modes of finance. Loan originators, unable<lb/> to discriminate between high and low-risk borrowers, often provide no funds for start-ups and young firms<lb/> (credit rationing). In this setting, supplies of venture capital are essential for the birth and growth of ISMEs<lb/> and HGSMEs. The government and financial institutions are the main suppliers of venture capital in<lb/> Korea, business angels playing a minor role. Norway ranks moderately higher than Korea regarding<lb/> venture capital flows in 2005 (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). For both countries, the greater part of venture capital investment<lb/> is devoted to firm expansion. In Norway, the state and local institutions provide two-thirds of these funds,<lb/> private investors the remainder. Mexico and Turkey, with no broadly based government support, have been<lb/> plagued, until recently, by acute shortages of venture capital.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Access to capabilities and to skilled labour<lb/></head>

			<p>Access to capabilities and skilled labour is strongly conditioned by income levels. Norway, a country<lb/> with a high level of human capital (high levels of upper-secondary and tertiary education), stands out<lb/> through its vibrant entrepreneurial culture and large-scale entrepreneurial education at school and<lb/> university. Early-stage entrepreneurial activity is high and rising, with over 9% of the adult population<lb/></p>

			<table>(18-64 years) being involved in this activity (2006). Not surprisingly, GEM surveys credit Norway with a<lb/> 14<lb/> Survey of Bankakaemie International, 2005.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></table>

			<p>strong entrepreneurial culture. Female participation in early stage entrepreneurial activities, though, is still<lb/> subdued. Korea, devoting the largest resources to education in terms of GDP among OECD countries, has<lb/> strongly improved quality and quantity of human capital. While entrepreneurship education at school and<lb/> university has been strengthened (since 2002), the eventual transition to entrepreneurial activity is subject<lb/> to cultural constraints.<lb/> In Mexico and Turkey, educational systems still underperform, despite recent progress in increasing<lb/> access to school education. Opportunities for entrepreneurship education at school and university are<lb/> sparse. In both countries, the absence of a large pool of skilled workers is a factor hampering innovative<lb/> activities by small and micro firms. In Mexico, the coverage of educational services lag OECD averages,<lb/> children spending comparatively few years in formal education. Entrepreneurial training for adults is low<lb/> notwithstanding entrepreneurial aspirations. In Turkey, education opportunities are limited, creating a large<lb/> supply of under-educated adults. In addition, cultural factors may hinder the inclination of certain groups,<lb/> notably women, to opt for entrepreneurship as a professional career.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> 1.<lb/> Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Faced with growing challenges from globalisation and the related shift towards a knowledge-based<lb/> economy many countries in the early 2000s altered the stance of entrepreneurship and SME policies. 15<lb/> Stronger emphasis came to be placed upon innovation as a key agent driving firm productivity growth.<lb/> Emerging as a major target variable of entrepreneurship and SME policies, innovation generally spans a<lb/> wide range of different forms, including product, process, individual and collaborative innovations. Under<lb/> the new policy approach, business start-ups and SMEs with a high growth potential (HGSMEs and ISMEs)<lb/> as well as collaborative innovations have generally been singled out as priority areas.<lb/> In varying degrees, Korea, Mexico, Norway and Turkey have all followed this trend. In each case, the<lb/> year 2004 marked a turning point indicating either a shift towards or a transition to an innovation-focused<lb/> entrepreneurship policy. A stronger international dimension, reflecting best-practice diffusion, often<lb/> enriched the new policy approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2004, Korea announced a plan to restructure its national innovation system. Mexico shifted its<lb/> policy towards a comprehensive, innovation-based policy approach. Norway created Innovation Norway<lb/> (2004) implementing part of the Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy (2003). At the same time,<lb/> Norway designed a new strategy for entrepreneurship education (2004). Turkey began accession<lb/> negotiations with the EU in 2004 which, three years later, gave rise to a new framework for<lb/> entrepreneurship and SME policies. The 2007 Operational Programme for Regional Competitiveness<lb/> (RCOP) has been prepared jointly by central and regional governments in collaboration with the EU<lb/> Commission.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> In search of collaborative innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<table>reorientation of entrepreneurship and SME policies early 2000 was, in some instances,<lb/> accompanied by significant &apos;institution-building&apos;. Mexico created the SME Fund (FONDO PYME, 2004)<lb/> within the Ministry of Economy, the government&apos;s main tool for shaping and implementing<lb/> innovation-oriented policies. This was followed in 2007 by the creation of the Innovation Fund jointly run<lb/> by the Ministry of Economy and the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT).<lb/> 15<lb/> OECD (2004), Global Knowledge Flows and Economic Development.<lb/></table>

			<p>Norway merged four separate support institutions to create &apos;<ref type="biblio">Innovation Norway&apos; (2004)</ref>, which<lb/> became the government&apos;s main instrument to implement the innovation strategy (From Idea to <ref type="biblio">Value,<lb/> 2003</ref>). Norway also established the Governmental Investment Fund (2007). Already endowed with a<lb/> central agency in charge of entrepreneurship and SME polices, Turkey with KOSGEB (1990) and Korea<lb/> with SMBA (1996) had no need for similar &apos;institution-building&apos;. Turkey, though, widened KOSGEB&apos;s<lb/> support approach (2007) which, in addition to industry, now includes tourism, information society, R&amp;D<lb/> and innovation in regions with a per capita income of less than 75% of the Turkish average.<lb/> Viewing social capital as a vital innovation asset, all countries are increasingly engaged in the<lb/> creation and expansion of a coherent infrastructure of public and private business &apos;service stations&apos;. The<lb/> collective efficiency strategy (collaborative innovation) is based upon the notion that a supportive<lb/> environment for business activities greatly enhances the productivity of firms at all stages of development.<lb/> In Mexico for example, the building of business &apos;service stations&apos; was followed by the creation of<lb/> networking links between same types of &apos;service stations&apos; as well as between different categories of<lb/> support units. In the period 2001-2007 Mexico developed networks between business development centers,<lb/> business incubators, centers for productive articulation (CAPs), innovation laboratories and business<lb/> accelerators. CAPs are mainly private micro or small business units acting as a hub for rendering high<lb/> added value services to special branches of industry, commerce and services. Business accelerators help<lb/> HGSMEs and ISMEs during their expansion phase.<lb/> All four countries have used &apos;geographical proximity&apos; as a means to reap higher dividends from<lb/> research activity. Korea introduced the &apos;Innovative Cluster City Policy&apos; (2005) aimed at integrating R&amp;D<lb/> infrastructures and generating networks between academia, research centers and industry. This policy also<lb/> strives to transform seven key manufacturing complexes into more innovation-oriented regional hubs.<lb/> Mexico&apos;s Programme for Strategic Projects aims to establish a homogenous infrastructure for business<lb/> activities, presenting a platform for foreign investment. Mexico has also created industrial parks,<lb/> productive chains, zones for eco-tourism and commercial centers as part of its Programme for Strategic<lb/> Productive <ref type="biblio">Projects (2001-2007</ref>).<lb/> Norway has installed Research Parks and &apos;Business Gardens&apos; (Business Development Centers) in<lb/> remote, rural areas deprived of colleges or universities. Acting as networking hubs, Business Gardens<lb/> function as a partner for firms, investors and researchers. Turkey has set up &apos;Synergy Focal Points&apos;<lb/> generalising services and assistance to SMEs. Under the new framework for entrepreneurship and SME<lb/> policies (<ref type="biblio">RCOP, 2007</ref>) Turkey has adopted a more focused &apos;growth-center approach&apos;. Inside<lb/> 12 less-developed regions, 15 growth centers with a high growth potential have been identified. About<lb/> 14% of all Turkish firms are located in these regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Network-building among firms<lb/></head>

			<p>Countries have also aimed at increasing horizontal and vertical networking within the business sector<lb/> in order to enhance the collaboration between firms. Korea has set up a foundation (2006) fostering<lb/> collaboration between large firms and SMEs via joint R&amp;D efforts and human resource development.<lb/> Mexico&apos;s National Programme of Suppliers&apos; <ref type="biblio">Development (SDP, 1995</ref>) has progressively led to voluntary,<lb/> strategic alliances between large firms and SMEs. Another Mexican programme (Programme for Strategic<lb/> Productive Projects) aims at attracting large firms, paving the way for micro firms to become part of<lb/> groups of competitive, local suppliers. Mexico has also established a network of export centers allowing<lb/> SMEs to sell products to large exporting firms.<lb/> In Norway, SIVA, a state enterprise owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has played a key<lb/> role in promoting strong regional and local industrial clusters. SIVA has upgraded the infrastructure for<lb/> innovative business activities. Turkey has used an increased flow of advisory services from professional<lb/> organisations and universities to create stronger links between large and smaller firms. Under the RCOP<lb/> (2007), Turkey also strives to tighten such connections applying a &apos;growth center approach&apos; to 12<lb/> less-developed regions. RCOP also stimulates the formation of sectoral clustering and inter-regional<lb/> network building in these regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Improving access to new technology and R&amp;D benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>Creating and channeling new technology to all categories of firms figures high on the four countries&apos;<lb/> policy agenda. Initiatives taken in this domain fall into two categories, one striving to improve R&amp;D<lb/> benefits through stronger ties between academia, research centers and the business sector, the other<lb/> enhancing SMEs&apos; capacity to absorb new technology. In many instances, policy initiatives have used the<lb/> advantage of geographical proximity, e.g. installing business incubators in universities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving links between academia, research centers and the business sector<lb/></head>

			<p>For many years, Korea has been concerned about its lack of overall R&amp;D efficiency. To improve<lb/> dividends from substantial R&amp;D spending Korea has progressively stepped up efforts in this field. The<lb/> Industry-University-Research Consortium Programme run by SMBA (1993) helped bring public research<lb/> efforts more in line with the needs of the enterprise sector. Subsequently, both the Technology Transfer<lb/> Promotion Act 2000 and the Transferred Technology Development Project (2003) strengthened the<lb/> technology transfer from the public to the private sector. In addition, business incubators have been<lb/> introduced in some universities and research institutes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mexico has established rising numbers of innovation laboratories and business accelerators as a<lb/> means to strengthen ties between research centers and mature SMEs and HGSMEs. In Norway, research<lb/> parks and Technology Transfer Offices (<ref type="biblio">TTO, 1993</ref>) have promoted the commercialisation of innovation.<lb/> Both support entities are closely integrated in universities. The FORNY programme (2000) has fostered<lb/> collaborative ties between the research community and the business sector. Turkey has set up Technology<lb/> Development Centers (TEKMER), enterprise development centers (IGEM) as well as business incubators<lb/> near or inside universities. Technical Development Zones (TDZ), concentrating on advanced technologies,<lb/> also provide an infrastructure for generating and directing knowledge flows to near-by enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing SMEs&apos; capacity to absorb new technology<lb/></head>

			<p>While better collaboration between research centers and firms tends to increase firms&apos; ability to apply<lb/> new technology, each country has taken additional supporting measures to spur firms&apos; innovative<lb/> momentum. Korea has built up a series of programmes over time, including the Technology Purchasing<lb/> Insurance (mid-1990s), the Small Business Innovation Research Programme (<ref type="biblio">KOSBIR, 1998</ref>), the Inno-<lb/>Biz Programme (2001), the SME Technology Innovation Programme (2001) and the SME IT<lb/> implementation support programme. As part of these efforts, business incubators have been introduced in<lb/> universities, while the use of ICT by small and micro firms has been promoted. To bridge the digitalisation<lb/> gap between metropolitan and local areas, Korea has also conceived the Regional Cluster for</p>

			<table>Digitalisation<lb/> Innovation programme.<lb/> Mexico has strongly relied on innovation laboratories and business incubators to support firms&apos;<lb/> innovative initiatives. Three kinds of incubators prop up start-ups in traditional, intermediate-technology<lb/> and high-technology sectors. Networks of business incubators (2003) and innovation laboratories (2005)<lb/> have been set up. Moreover, the Programme for Innovation and Technological Development has promoted<lb/> the transfer of technology from large to smaller firms in the automobile industry. This has led to the<lb/> formation of clusters for robots and automation. Norway has also deployed business incubators, reserving a<lb/> special type for heavy industry. In Turkey, TEKMERs and business incubators facilitate SMEs&apos; use of new<lb/> technology. TEKMERs teach entrepreneurs how to access support services. They also establish better<lb/> relationships between SMEs and technology service providers, mostly public organisations.<lb/></table>

			<head>4.<lb/> Easing access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>A wide range of instruments have been put into place to ease firms&apos; access to credit and venture<lb/> capital. In Korea, SMEs without collateral and technological know-how receive credit support through<lb/> guarantee schemes operated by the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) and the Korea Technology<lb/> Credit Guarantee Fund (KOTEC). The base for guarantees is backed up by financial government support to<lb/> these organisations. In addition, eligible small firms in the start-up phase can obtain loans from the Small<lb/> Business Corporation (SBC) at low interest rates.<lb/></p>

			<table>Mexico&apos;s National Guarantee System (2003) and the National Financial Extension Programme (2004)<lb/> aim to enlarge credit supplies. A novel bidding process for guarantee funds has been set in motion (2005),<lb/> kindling competition among financial intermediaries in search of loan guarantees. The National Financial<lb/> Extension Programme, reaching nation-wide coverage in 2006, provides a financial assessment net helping<lb/> firms enter into credit relationships. Improved credit applications are screened by a nation-wide web of<lb/> commercial banks&apos; branches.<lb/> Norway&apos;s &apos;Innovation Norway Guarantee Scheme&apos; targets SMEs with up to 100 employees. Because<lb/> of stringent conditionality and low guarantee coverage, private banks rarely use this scheme. Most micro<lb/> loans are available through the Cultura Bank offering credit guarantees with a better guarantee coverage in<lb/> collaboration with the European Investment Fund. Funds are also available under grant schemes supporting<lb/> projects for collaborative innovations.<lb/> Turkey extends credit guarantees through the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF<ref type="biblio">, 1994</ref>) and the Union of<lb/> Turkish Artisans and Craftsmen Credit Cooperatives. Under the SME Finance Facility credits at low<lb/> interest rates are given to SMEs located in less-developed regions. Under the SELP programme, small<lb/> loans with a maturity of over a year are extended to SMEs. Aside from these measures, Turkey has<lb/> extensively used investment allowances as a means to promote investment in fixed assets. The new SME<lb/> Strategy and Action <ref type="biblio">Plan (2007-2009)</ref>, the first segment of the 9 th Development <ref type="biblio">Plan (2007-2013</ref>),<lb/> provides additional funds for micro loan mechanisms and related advisory services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing the supply of venture capital<lb/></head>

			<p>Korea views venture capital markets as a primary source of finance for start-ups and high-growth<lb/> businesses. Accordingly, the government has strongly backed the venture capital market by creating<lb/> venture capital investment funds and setting up venture capital firms and venture capital partnerships. A<lb/> &apos;fund of funds&apos; was established in 2004. Mexico, in an effort to increase supplies of venture capital for<lb/> high-growth firms, introduced the Seed Capital Programme (2005), using partnerships and subsidised loans<lb/> formulas. Prospective innovative entrepreneurs also benefit from similar support under the FORPRODE<lb/> Programme. Through a unique investment guarantee (PYME Option), Mexico also promotes the creation<lb/> of &apos;Investors Clubs&apos;. These clubs seek a high return on capital through investment in innovative firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given small and fragmented capital markets, Norway has instaured mechanisms to provide risk<lb/> capital investors with public co-investment schemes (Seed Capital <ref type="biblio">Scheme and Argentum, 2001</ref>). A public<lb/> investment fund was set up in 2007 to meet financial needs of potential high-growth firms. In Turkey,<lb/> venture capital is mainly supplied by two venture capital investment trusts. KOBI, a public incorporated<lb/> company, acts as a risk intermediary offering various financial instruments for ISMEs and HGSMEs.<lb/> ISRISK, a private company, performs similar functions.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> Easing access to entrepreneurship education and training<lb/></head>

			<p>To different degrees, all countries have put stronger emphasis upon entrepreneurship education.<lb/> Injecting entrepreneurial spirits into all levels of education and business stages came to be seen as an<lb/> engine for future innovation. Korea views entrepreneurship training and education as a key element in<lb/> promoting business start-ups. Entrepreneurship development programmes have been set up both at<lb/> secondary and tertiary level (<ref type="biblio">Biz-cool programme, 2003</ref>). &apos;Entrepreneur clubs&apos; at universities develop a<lb/> &apos;start-up mindset&apos; in students. Through a public education institute (1982), Korea has also upgraded the<lb/> quality of the SME workforce. Three regional centers have been established recently, providing in-house<lb/> training for ICT use.<lb/> Mexico&apos;s network of Business Development Centers (<ref type="biblio">BDCs, 2001</ref>), though not providing direct<lb/> entrepreneurship training, offers concrete business solutions such as drawing up loan requests based upon<lb/> the assessment by BDCs of financial needs. Conventional BDCs provide basic support services, especially<lb/> to subsistence entrepreneurs. &apos;BDCs Plus&apos; assist ISMEs and HGSMEs. Direct training for entrepreneurs,<lb/> notably subsistence entrepreneurs, is extended under both the</p>

			<table>Programme for Training and Strengthening<lb/> firms&apos; Capabilities and the PROMODE Programme. Since 2005, training options have been differentiated<lb/> to correspond to different innovation forms.<lb/> Mexico&apos;s Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms&apos; Capabilities offers three kinds of<lb/> training: conventional training, specialised training for product and process innovations and training the<lb/> &apos;coaches&apos;. Entrepreneurship receives nation-wide attention during the annual SME-week, a national event.<lb/> Mobile information centers (SME policy vans) spread information about opportunities to benefit from<lb/> government support. Regular business forums attract &apos;would-be&apos; entrepreneurs.<lb/></table>

			<p>Norway launched a national strategy for entrepreneurship education in 2004. The strategy covers all<lb/> stages of the educational system from primary school to college and university, and includes teacher<lb/> training. Several universities provide both compulsory and voluntary courses on entrepreneurship,<lb/> economics and technology. Revised in 2006 the strategy for entrepreneurship education now focuses on<lb/> support to organisations and other stakeholders (municipalities and trade and industry associations) that<lb/> normally promote entrepreneurship education. The government also supports &apos;Junior Achievement-Young<lb/> Enterprise Norway&apos; (<ref type="biblio">JA-YE, 1997</ref>), Norway&apos;s largest private supplier of entrepreneurship training. The<lb/> programme &apos;Introductory Enterprises&apos;, providing expert guidance, assists immigrants in developing<lb/> entrepreneurial qualities.<lb/> Turkey&apos;s KOSGEB, through its Enterprise Development Centers (BDC) and Technological<lb/> Development Centers, operates several incentive and training programmes. KOSGEB&apos;s Center for<lb/> Entrepreneurship disseminates information about potentially viable business opportunities. Market<lb/> research findings are spread through the networks of IGEMs, TEKMERs and small industrial estates<lb/> (SSIEs). Information about best practices is also released. For business start ups, KOSGEB has two<lb/> training programmes, one supplying general educational services, the other offering specialised training<lb/> given by professional (public or private) organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>A successful entrepreneurship and SME policy evolves through time with the maturing of both<lb/> innovative processes and supporting service units. Three policy phases are usefully distinguished, the first<lb/> one spurring R&amp;D and innovation so as to create vast segments of ISMES and HSMEs. During the second<lb/> phase, the innovations are spread through improved scientific networks, specialised institutions and better<lb/> access to venture capital. In the third and final phase, the innovative momentum gathers pace stimulated by<lb/> learning effects and the transition to the knowledge economy. 16<lb/></p>

			<p>Both Norway and Korea have, over the past few years, made significant progress in all three policy<lb/> phases. This is evident in better co-ordinated R&amp;D efforts, higher R&amp;D spending (Korea), better<lb/> opportunities for training and entrepreneurship education, stronger early stage and innovative activity,<lb/> better networking facilities and rising ICT diffusion from high levels (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> For Mexico and Turkey, the evidence is mixed. In both countries, large industrial firms and MSEs,<lb/> have made progress in the first two policy phases as outlined above. Novel and enlarged support services,<lb/> rapidly rising ICT use along with stronger private R&amp;D efforts have boosted large companies&apos; and MSEs&apos;<lb/> capacity to compete internationally (stronger growth-oriented activity). The rising use of business<lb/> incubators, innovation laboratories and geographical bundling of business support units (advantage of<lb/> geographical proximity) has contributed to this outcome.<lb/> At the same time, though, vast numbers of Mexico and Turkey&apos;s small and micro firms (large<lb/> oversupply of subsistence entrepreneurship) lack access to technology, education, training and finance.<lb/> Injecting a growth-oriented entrepreneurial spirit into these &apos;excluded&apos; firms demands a broad, balanced<lb/> policy approach. Better education on all levels, including entrepreneurship education for both men and<lb/> women, and basic training courses will eventually raise the propensity for business start ups as well as<lb/> micro firms&apos; capacity to absorb ICT. This calls for non-R&amp;D based and collaborative innovations making<lb/> small and micro firms eligible for inclusion in producer networks. Countries need to test simple and cost-<lb/>efficient variants of these collaborative innovations like mobile business development centers and mobile<lb/> banks, which have been successfully used elsewhere.<lb/> Until recently, Mexico&apos;s and, especially, Turkey&apos;s entrepreneurship and SME policies appear to have<lb/> been tilted towards backing HGSMEs and ISMEs rather than designing comprehensive support<lb/> programmes for small and micro firms. Turkey&apos;s 2007 RCOP programme (2007-2013), though, is based on<lb/> the principle of a &apos;bottom-up&apos; convergence of firm productivity levels. Drawn up jointly with the EU<lb/> commission, RCOP is scheduled to rebalance the policy approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both Mexico and Turkey show positive results for basic training courses (large participation, higher<lb/> survival rates for micro firms), but they still lack appropriate nation-wide micro-finance mechanisms. This<lb/> is especially the case for Turkey where small-loan activities are highly underdeveloped, where credit<lb/> guarantee opportunities are sparse and where credit advisory services are limited. Many micro firms are<lb/> thus compelled to rely on costly suppliers&apos; credits or on informal money lenders (effective lending rates<lb/> being a multiple of benchmark interest rates).<lb/> Korea is also concerned about large gaps in efficiency levels between successful large firms and less<lb/> effective SMEs. The duality in the firm population needs to be addressed by helping large manufacturing<lb/> firms keep their competitive edge, while allowing smaller firms, notably in the service sector, to catch up.<lb/> An efficient infrastructure of business services, providing differentiated support and training, would allow<lb/> easier diffusion of knowledge in the lagging business segments. Private R&amp;D spending, though high by<lb/> international comparison, is extremely low in the service sector. Tapping this sector&apos;s large innovation<lb/> potential calls for deeper and wider forms of collaborative innovations. Increased vertical network building<lb/> between large firms and SMEs is one way of spreading chain-based innovations.<lb/> In Norway, the issue of a two-tier business sector is less apparent. Differences in inter-firm<lb/> productivity levels are comparatively small, reflecting its high-income position and intensive, wide-spread<lb/> entrepreneurship education. Nearly the totality of newly created micro firms, for example, has been shown<lb/> to survive three-year periods. Even so, there is still room for progress which additional collaborative<lb/> formulae are able to exploit.<lb/></p>

			<head>Summing up<lb/></head>

			<p>Income levels largely condition impediments to entrepreneurial and innovative activities. Mexico and<lb/> Turkey are marked by a large oversupply of subsistence entrepreneurship, manifest in low efficiency ratios<lb/> for small and micro firms, high shares of micro firms in the overall firm population and correspondingly<lb/> low levels of aggregate firm productivity. Low R&amp;D intensity and weak ICT penetration interact, damping<lb/> innovative activity, maintaining uncompetitive behaviour in the banking sector, depressing advisory<lb/> capacity for business services and keeping business activities from being internationalised. Retarding<lb/> collaborative innovations low-ICT diffusion thus undercuts entrepreneurship and SME policies.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a capital shortage in low-income countries reflected in both high real interest rates and a high<lb/> dispersion of firm-size related lending rates around high interest rate averages. This hits small and micro<lb/> firms more than proportionately, stifling innovative initiatives of potential and actual entrepreneurs.<lb/> Underperforming educational systems coupled with a lack of entrepreneurship education and cultural<lb/> biases perpetuate this web of impediments.<lb/> For the higher-income countries, obstacles to entrepreneurial and innovative activities are less<lb/> binding. However, Korea&apos;s sizeable R&amp;D efforts do not seem to yield commensurate results in terms of<lb/> innovations (lack of process innovations), while Norway&apos;s R&amp;D intensity looks small relative to the<lb/> income level. Collaborative innovations are suboptimal in both countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>The country sample (four countries) is small, but rich in diversity. Two countries, Mexico and Turkey,<lb/> are at the bottom of the OECD per-capita income ranking. Rapid population growth and low productivity<lb/> gains, has, in both cases, damped income convergence (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). At the other end is Norway, enjoying an<lb/> income level nearly 50% above the OECD average, and Korea, which stands out by its exceptional pace of<lb/> real income convergence in recent years.<lb/></p>

			<p>In spite of this diversity, entrepreneurship is an important policy concern to the four countries<lb/> surveyed. They are all faced by the growing challenge of globalisation and the related shift towards a<lb/> knowledge-based economy. They all aim to move up these emerging global value chains and they are all<lb/> convinced of the potential of entrepreneurship policies to reinforce innovation policies and boost<lb/> productivity growth. Accordingly, they have all implemented active policies towards increasing firms&apos;<lb/> access to new technologies, to finance and to capabilities and skills.<lb/></p>

			<p>These four country case studies are aimed at throwing some light on the main policy issues related to<lb/> entrepreneurship policies. They are meant as a starting point for a more coherent effort by the Committee<lb/> on Industry, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, together with its Working Party on SMEs and<lb/> Entrepreneurship, to understand how entrepreneurship policies can help foster innovation.<lb/></p>

			<head>KOREA<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Korea&apos;s economic development has been marked by a rapid pace of convergence, per capita income<lb/> having reached two-thirds of the OECD average. In this context, entrepreneurship and SME policies have<lb/> been used extensively for over a decade to spur innovation and increase productivity in the enterprise<lb/> sector. In a setting of rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences, supporting the creation of<lb/> innovative enterprises was rightly seen as a policy priority.<lb/></p>

			<p>The link between entrepreneurial policy and innovation is by nature indirect. Efficient measures of<lb/> entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation and expansion, and by doing so they strengthen innovative<lb/> activity. Viewed from a wider angle, entrepreneurship policy itself may pave the way for &quot; collective<lb/> process innovations &quot; , augmenting the effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on<lb/> individual innovations.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first part of this chapter highlights the main features of Korea&apos;s enterprise population, identifies<lb/> main drivers of entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The<lb/> second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes in four<lb/> major areas of policy intervention: access to R&amp;D and technology, access to finance, capabilities and<lb/> access to skilled labour, and cultural values. The third part provides an evaluation of entrepreneurship<lb/> policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation<lb/> 1.<lb/> Main characteristics of the enterprise sector<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2006 there were an estimated 3 million businesses in Korea, employing around 12 million persons<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.1). SMEs 17 with less than 300 employees accounted for over 99% of all firms and about 88% of<lb/> total employment. Micro firms (0-9 employees) represented 88% of the enterprise population and 41% of<lb/> the employment in 2006, while small firms (10-49 employees) accounted for 8% of the firm population<lb/> and 21% of employment. In comparison, medium (50-299 employees) and large (over 300 employees)<lb/> enterprises represented respectively 3% and less than 0.1% of the enterprise population and employed<lb/> respectively about 25% and 12% of the total number of persons in 2006 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.1).<lb/></p>

			<p>The definition of business size can be different in some sectors. SMEs in Korea are defined in terms of<lb/> employees and paid-in capital or revenue and vary depending on industry sectors. For more information on<lb/> definitions, see Annex 1.A,</p>

			<p>Regarding output, manufacturing SMEs are responsible for over half of the manufacturing value<lb/> added. They also have an important weight in exports: SMEs accounted for 42% of Korea&apos;s total exports in<lb/> 2002, this share falling to 32% in 2007. Most of SMEs&apos; exports came from the manufacturing sector<lb/> electronics and electrical components (28%), machinery (22%), textile (14%), chemical (15%), steel and<lb/> metal (10%).<lb/> Almost half of Korea&apos;s population and economic activity are concentrated in the capital region: Seoul,<lb/> Incheon and Gyeonggi Province. This level of concentration is high compared to other OECD countries<lb/> (Annex 1.A, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.A.1).<lb/> After the Asian financial crisis in 1997 the number of large firms decreased significantly and so has<lb/> the share of persons employed by large enterprises.

			<p>Restructuring following the crisis has allowed large enterprises to significantly improve their<lb/> performance. In contrast, SMEs which largely avoided restructuring have experienced a secular decline in<lb/> their financial health and profitability. This is apparent in the rising difference in profit margins until 2004<lb/> between SMEs and large enterprises (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.4). This polarisation is also apparent in a higher debt to<lb/> equity ratio for SMEs. In addition, there is a divergence within the SME sector itself with a significant<lb/> share of very weak firms. 19<lb/></p>

			<p>Bankruptcy laws have been amended to facilitate the exit and restructuring of firms. Several fast<lb/> tracks and less costly bankruptcy processes have been introduced for small firms. The unified bankruptcy<lb/> law, integrating three bankruptcy-related laws, has allowed firms to choose between several bankruptcy<lb/> processes, lowering costs as a consequence. According to the 2005 OECD Survey &quot; Policy Questionnaire<lb/> on Bankruptcy &quot; , 20 possibilities for reorganising a company and chances of getting a fresh start in case of<lb/> financial difficulties are just above average, compared to other OECD countries.

			<head>2.<lb/> Factors driving firm creation and expansion<lb/> a) Access to new technology and R&amp;D benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>Korea is the world leader in producing ICT goods, and the share of ICT value added in the business<lb/> sector value added is amongst the highest in the OECD area. Its domestic diffusion of ICT is stronger than<lb/> the OECD average (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.5), especially considering its per capita income reaching two-thirds of the<lb/> OECD average. While Korea performs well in terms of broadband infrastructure there is a large<lb/> digitalisation gap between metropolitan areas and regions. Overall, investment in ICT equipment is lower<lb/> than in many other OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.3). This can be explained by the high share of small and<lb/> micro firms in the firm population and their inherent difficulty in absorbing ICT, notably in the services<lb/> sector. A recent survey conducted by the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) reveals that<lb/> the informatisation level of SMEs in 2005 only ranked around 50 on a 0–100 scale. Many SMEs have<lb/> neither fully integrated the advanced broadband environment and the necessary intra-firm organisational<lb/> changes, nor inter-firm collaboration linked to the integration of ICT. This is due to lack of awareness, lack<lb/> of skilled labour and lack of specialist services. In addition, a large number of SMEs are discouraged by<lb/> medium to longer term costs of IT investment.<lb/></p>

This is also the case of business R&amp;D spending which represented<lb/> over 2% of industry value added in 1999, 3.2% in 2005, as against 2.2% for OECD countries. 22 However</table>

			<p>,<lb/> according to a number of indicators, Korea may not be getting the full benefit from high government and<lb/> business R&amp;D spending. 23 The output of codified knowledge in the form of patents and publications as<lb/> measured by the number of triadic patent families is weak.<lb/> R&amp;D expenditure is concentrated in a small number of firms and industries in manufacturing. About<lb/> three-quarters of business-sector R&amp;D is carried out in high and medium-high technology manufacturing<lb/> industries; out of these three-quarters, 80% was concentrated in two sectors, ICT and automobile, one of<lb/> the highest rates for OECD countries. Overall, Korea&apos;s business-sector R&amp;D activities are concentrated in<lb/> a relatively small number of larger firms. A recent survey of 12 000 firms with in-house research suggests<lb/> that large enterprises accounted for 78% of business R&amp;D expenditure (the top five firms 24 representing<lb/> 45%) in 2006. R&amp;D expenditure in the services sector on the other hand is comparatively very low. In<lb/> 2001 and 2002 the proportion of service-sector enterprises engaged in innovation activity was 25%, well<lb/> below the EU average of 40%.</p>

			<p>The level of technology transfer from the public sector (universities and government research<lb/> institutes) to the private sector is weak and insufficient. This is of concern as over half of the public R&amp;D<lb/> budget is channeled to public research institutes and one-quarter to universities, while only 10% of<lb/> government R&amp;D funds are directly allocated to SMEs. According to a recent survey from the Ministry of<lb/> Commerce, Industry and Energy (2006), the technology transfer rate from the public sector and academia<lb/> to the business sector was about 20% against respectively 28% and 41% for the United States and Canada.<lb/></p>

			<p>The innovation system is characterised by limited reliance of industry on public scientific research<lb/> benefits and low responsiveness of public research efforts to business demands. In 2003, 97% of business-<lb/>financed R&amp;D was performed by the business sector independently.

			<head>b) Access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>The ratio of credit to the private sector from financial institutions is below average compared to other<lb/> OECD countries and obtaining a bank loan without collateral is difficult. 29 While loans to SMEs have risen<lb/> continuously since the 1997 crisis (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.5) banks&apos; decisions to lend to SMEs still rely heavily on real<lb/> estate collateral or credit guarantees provided by the public sector. There is a reluctance to accept<lb/> intangible assets such as innovative ideas, new technology or human capital. The minimum capital<lb/> required for starting a business 30 is comparatively high, acting as a major deterrent to firm creation and<lb/> expansion.<lb/></p>

			<head>c) Access to capabilities and to skilled labour<lb/></head>

			<p>Korea has achieved impressive results in terms of upgrading the level of human capital over the past<lb/> 20 years. While the percentage of the population with upper-secondary education is below average for the<lb/> population aged 45-54, it is amongst the highest of all OECD countries for the population aged 25-34<lb/> (Annex 1.A, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.A.4). Spending on education as a share of GDP is the highest in the OECD,<lb/> reflecting a high investment in knowledge. Korea&apos;s focus on primary and secondary school education has<lb/> contributed to the outstanding performance of its students by international standards. Korean fifteen-year<lb/> olds have very high scores in the PISA 36 test (Annex 1.A, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.A.5), and a high number of students are<lb/> pursuing scientific and technical courses.<lb/></p>

			<p>In tertiary education, however, there has been a decline in quality in the context of a sharp increase in<lb/> quantity: about 50% of the population aged 25-34 has completed tertiary education in 2004 (Annex 1.A<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.A.6), against less than 20% for the population aged 45-54 (the average for 19 European Union<lb/> countries is 30%). The ratio of students to teaching staff has risen to a level well above the OECD average,<lb/> while spending per student is about 15% of the OECD average. The related reliance on private outlays and<lb/> the limited supply of student loans or grants has created concerns about the access of low-income<lb/> households to higher education. A survey of business executives ranked the usefulness of Korea&apos;s<lb/> university education 59 th out of 60 countries. 37<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> 1.<lb/> Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy<lb/></head>

			<p>For about 40 years, SME policies have focused on protecting SMEs&apos; business territory from large<lb/> enterprises and ensuring SME stability. Since 2004, SME policies have become more market-oriented,<lb/> pro-competitive and forward-looking, encouraging entrepreneurship and SME innovation. 38 Korea&apos;s SME<lb/> policy priorities aim to create a positive environment for SMEs allowing any entrepreneur with creative<lb/> ideas and dynamism to start a new enterprise as well as to increase SMEs&apos; innovative capacity and global<lb/> competitiveness. Differentiated policy programmes have been implemented depending on the type of SME<lb/> (Box 1.1). The development of innovative SMEs has nonetheless been at the heart of SME policies and<lb/> even economic policies as a whole. The creation of the KOSDAQ and the enactment of the law on special<lb/> measures to promote venture business were designed to feed high-technology start-ups with funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>SME policies and programmes have been modified annually in Korea, yielding a wide array of SME<lb/> support measures (Annex 1.A, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.A.2). In 2004, as much as 76 different programmes were supervised<lb/> by 12 different ministries. Programmes are structured around four main policy areas: enhancing<lb/> entrepreneurship and facilitating start-ups, easing access to finance and venture capital markets, promoting<lb/> technology and increasing innovation capacity, and strengthening human capital.<lb/></p>

			<p>In recent years, two major plans have affected start-ups and SMEs (Box 1.2). In 2004 a<lb/> comprehensive programme (Plan to restructure the national innovation system) was launched to<lb/> restructure the national innovation system. It aimed to: provide effective tax incentives to the business<lb/> sector to boost R&amp;D; foster 10 000 innovation-driven SMEs through technical and financial assistance,<lb/> subsidies for employing R&amp;D personnel and easing regulation on start-up companies; create incentives at<lb/> tertiary level and reform the primary and secondary school to secure future science and engineering<lb/> students; strengthen technology diffusion; develop regional innovation clusters and foster Daedeok Science<lb/> Town as a special R&amp;D region; strengthen linkages between business, government and universities.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2005, a government programme was adopted for small self-employed businesses and the services<lb/> sector to restructure services, stabilise business activities of the small self-employed and upgrade<lb/> competitiveness through franchising.

			<head>Main actors<lb/></head>

			<p>The Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) established in 1996 is the main actor in the<lb/> field of entrepreneurship and SME policies (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.7); the administrator of SMBA is hierarchically at<lb/> vice-minister level. Its mandate is to plan, implement and evaluate SME policies. A public agency, it<lb/> reports to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE). SMBA has 6 offices at its<lb/> headquarters and 11 regional offices. <ref type="biblio">It</ref> employs a total of 630 persons. SMBA&apos;s budget amounted to<lb/> KRW 2 trillion in 2006.<lb/> The Small Business Corporation (SBC), which reports to SMBA, was set up in 1979 to implement<lb/> and fund some of the SME programmes. SBC&apos;s budget was KRW 6.5 trillion for 2006 and the loans<lb/> supplied to 9 000 SMEs amounted to KRW 2.1 trillion. Its 748 staff members provide consulting services<lb/> to about 2 500 firms and train 67 000 persons every year.<lb/> Two independent public guarantee institutions, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) and the<lb/> Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund (KOTEC) provide credit guarantees to SMEs:<lb/> • KCGF was established in 1976 under the provisions of the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund Act.<lb/> Its mandate is to achieve a balanced development of the national economy by extending credit<lb/> guarantees to enterprises lacking collateral. It also ensures sound credit transactions through<lb/> efficient management of credit information.<lb/> • KOTEC was founded in 1989 under the Financial Assistance to New Technology Business<lb/> Act. TCGF provides credit guarantees to new technology based enterprises, to technologically<lb/> strong SMEs and venture businesses.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The myriad of programmes designed for SMEs in the past decade involved most ministries (Annex<lb/> 1.A, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>			<figure>.A.2), creating problems of ministerial co-ordination. This has motivated the establishment in<lb/> 1998 of a Presidential Commission on Small and Medium Enterprise, simplifying and harmonising SME<lb/> policies. The responsibility for entrepreneurship and SME programmes lies with three ministries: MOCIE,<lb/> the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) and the Ministry of Labour.<lb/> Figure 1.7.

			<table>a)<lb/> Access to technology, R&amp;D benefits and networking activities<lb/> Developing SMEs&apos; capacity in terms of technology and knowledge has been a key policy priority<lb/> since 1998. The size of R&amp;D funds available for SMEs has been rising continuously since 2001 – SMBA<lb/> R&amp;D funds represented USD 383 million in 2007 as against USD 139 million in 2001 (see Table 1.7 for<lb/> the allocation of SMBA&apos;s R&amp;D budget).<lb/></table>

			<p>Entrepreneurship and SME policies have mainly targeted the promotion of technology-based start-<lb/>ups. Programmes (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.8) have consequently focused on four intervention areas: i) fostering innovative<lb/> SMEs ii) facilitating commercialisation of R&amp;D; iii) reinforcing networks between industry, academia and<lb/> research institutes, but also between large enterprises and SMEs, iv) integrating SMEs in the digitalisation<lb/> infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing SMEs&apos; innovation capacity<lb/></head>

			<p>The Korea Small Business Innovation Research Programme (KOSBIR) was introduced in 1998 to<lb/> support the technological development of SMEs. Under this programme public institutes and central<lb/> government agencies are to allocate 5% of their R&amp;D budget to the technological development of SMEs.<lb/> The Inno-Biz Programme was introduced in 2001 to better identify and foster innovative SMEs. Firms<lb/> defined as innovative businesses are those which are equipped with superior technology and able to<lb/> enhance their technological level through their own technological innovation system. The programme aims<lb/> to help these SMEs grow and become well-established firms by providing them with technology<lb/> guarantees and preferential treatment on credit loans. In 2006, around 7 000 SMEs were classified as<lb/> &quot; Inno-Biz &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>The SME Technology Innovation Programme</head>

			<figure>introduced in 2001 funds SMEs capable of developing<lb/> new technologies independently. These firms can recover 75% of their expenses linked to developing new<lb/> products and enhancing product quality up to certain ceilings (USD 300 000 for two years in the case of<lb/> strategic tasks; USD 100 000 for one year in the case of general tasks). Over 1 900 SMEs benefitted from<lb/> the programme in 2005.<lb/></figure>

			<p>To promote SME products with new technology, the government introduced Priority Purchasing of<lb/> Technology Products in the mid-1990s. Development of new technology by SMEs was encouraged by<lb/> making public institutions purchase SME products developed with new technology first. Since 2002 the<lb/> government also introduced a purchasing insurance on new products developed by SMEs: public<lb/> institutions and large enterprises commission SMEs to develop a new technology and commit to purchase<lb/> new products over a certain period of time.<lb/> Business Incubators (BIs) have been introduced in some universities and research institutes since<lb/> 1998 in order to increase the chances of survival of newly created firms, and to promote the expansion of<lb/> newly created technology-oriented enterprises. <ref type="biblio">In 2007, 269</ref> BIs provided facilities and equipment to more<lb/> than 5 000 companies over 3-5 years&apos;, 84% of these BIs being situated in universities. Services and support<lb/> include amongst others the office or production space, expert consulting services, marketing training and<lb/> connection to investors. Business incubators, who are overseen by SMBA were downsized for more<lb/> efficiency between 2005 and 2007 and were scaled-down from over 300 to about 270.<lb/></p>

			<head>Facilitating technology transfer and commercialisation<lb/></head>

			<p>The government adopted the Technology Transfer Promotion Act in 2000 in order to promote<lb/> technology transfer from the public to the private sector. The Korean Technology Transfer Centre (KTTC)<lb/> was established to better assess the potential of technology, and develop its financial return, by helping<lb/> SMEs to commercialise it. Under the Transferred Technology Development Project,</p>

			<figure>SMBA covers<lb/> additional development costs required to commercialise technologies owned by universities, research<lb/> institutes and businesses. According to MOCIE, the technology transfer ratio from research institutes and<lb/> universities has risen from 18.5% in 2004 to 20.7% in 2005.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In 1998, the government introduced a three years leave of absence for professors and researchers in<lb/> order to incite high-skilled individuals to start an innovative business (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.9 for the number of<lb/> businesses created by professors and researchers). The 2007 amendment to the law of special measures to<lb/> promote venture business has introduced further incentives for starting a businesses using new technology.<lb/> It allows professors or researchers to make profit out of their technology and creates special areas within<lb/> universities and research institutions with integrated entrepreneurship facilities. The option of a leave of<lb/> absence for professors and researchers has been extended to six years and to all forms of business creation.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Industry-University-Research Consortium Programme</head>

			<figure>is run by SMBA and was introduced in<lb/> 1993 to increase the technological capacity of SMEs. Under this programme, universities or research<lb/> institutes develop technology needed in the manufacturing field in collaboration with SMEs. Stakeholders<lb/> of regional innovation -Regional Innovation Centers (RRC), Techno Parks, Business Incubators (BIs),<lb/> Technology Licensing Offices (TLO) -are also involved in the programme. In 2005, about 220 consortia<lb/> were formed to support 2 700 SMEs in developing new technologies.<lb/> A network of support for SMEs on intellectual property (IP) matters was established in 2000,<lb/> involving the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the chambers of commerce, the government<lb/> SME support agencies, local governments, the Korean Patent Attorneys Association (KPAA) and other<lb/> private partners. It aims to help SMEs acquire IPRs, support commercialisation and reduce costs linked to<lb/> the patenting of inventions. KIPO and KPAA signed a co-operation agreement whereby SMEs are<lb/> provided with free patent management services for their first patent application.<lb/> Encouraging networking<lb/> The Innovative Cluster City Policy was introduced in 2005 as part of the comprehensive Plan for<lb/> National Balanced Development (2005-2008). This policy aims to strengthen the industrial complex by<lb/> integrating R&amp;D infrastructures and developing networks between academia, research institutions and<lb/> industry. It aims to transform seven key regional industrial complexes from manufacturing centers into<lb/> more innovation-oriented regional hubs. As of 2007, 1 893 firms, 661 universities and research centers and<lb/> 303 supporting institutions were involved in the programme.<lb/></figure>

			<p>To allow innovative SMEs to locate their buildings in areas where access to finance, transports,<lb/> communications and research are high level, the government has provided incentives for private building<lb/> companies to host innovative SMEs through exemptions from local taxes and expenses since 2001. In the<lb/> context of the policy for a balanced regional development, a selection of areas were identified as &quot; venture<lb/> promotion areas &quot; and innovative SMEs were incited to move from the metropolitan area to regional<lb/> clusters. There are currently 25 priority areas, 8 are situated in the metropolitan region while 17 are<lb/> dispersed in other regions. A total of USD 144 million were raised by the central government and the local<lb/> governments (on a one-to-one basis) to allow the creation of favourable business conditions in these<lb/> identified areas. This has included the creation of business support centers. Between 2002 and 2006, the<lb/> concentration level of SMEs has increased from 17% to 22%; the average sales have risen by 56% while<lb/> the average employment has increased by 30%.<lb/></p>

			<p>To address the rising bipolarisation between large companies and SMEs in terms of labour<lb/> productivity, profits and wages, the Korean government has introduced a new framework to enhance<lb/> co-operation</p>

			<head>. Under the 2006 Act on Promoting Cooperation between Large companies and SMEs<lb/></head>

			<figure>MOCIE has set up a foundation in collaboration with business to execute policies. Enhanced cooperation<lb/> takes the form of exchange of information, human resource development, joint efforts in R&amp;D activities<lb/> and fair treatment of SMEs.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<head>Enhancing access to information technology<lb/></head>

			<p>As small firms are relatively slow in adopting ICTs and new technologies, the Korean government has<lb/> created programmes promoting ICT use by small and micro firms. These are run separately or jointly by<lb/> MOCIE, MIC and SMBA. Programmes often target SMEs in the early stages of e-business adoption or<lb/> those without e-business experience.<lb/></p>

			<head>• The Digital Innovation Consortium</head>

			<p>is run by the SMBA, regional universities, related agencies and<lb/> consulting firms and assists SMEs in IT strategy, restructuring and in the use of appropriate<lb/> software.<lb/> • With the SME IT implementation support programme, the government provides 80% of the cost of<lb/> professional consulting and the planning of IT implementation. Basic software, consulting services<lb/> and training on the use of software are provided by the SBC and the Korean Chamber of<lb/> Commerce and Industry.<lb/></p>

			<p>To bridge the digitalisation gap between metropolitan areas and local regions and to accelerate the<lb/> digitalisation of SMEs in economically poor areas, the Regional Cluster for Digitalisation Innovation<lb/> programme created in 2002 seeks to establish a broadband Internet infrastructure and an internal network<lb/> to lay the foundation for digitalisation. The SMBA designated clusters in 8 regions in 2005 (budget<lb/> USD 2.1 million).<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> Better access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>The government has provided direct and indirect financing support for SMEs which find it difficult to<lb/> obtain a bank loan without collateral. Direct financing is provided by venture capital and the KOSDAQ<lb/> market. Indirect financing services are provided through a guarantee system (security assurance service)<lb/> for SMEs which are ineligible for bank loans, due to a lack of collateral and technology.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Two organisations are involved in the credit guarantee schemes. SMEs can borrow funds from banks<lb/> through the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) or the Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund<lb/> (KOTEC). In 2006, KOTEC provided a total of KRW 931 billion worth of guarantees to<lb/> 7 314 beneficiaries and KRW 90 billion to 348 enterprises at incubation stage. KCGF had KRW 28 trillion<lb/> worth of credit guarantees for the same year, the number of firm beneficiaries being 203 096. The base for<lb/> guarantees is strengthened through financial government support to these organisations. The stock of<lb/> guarantees represented 6% of GDP in 2004 and covered almost one-third of total lending to SMEs. On<lb/> average, credit guarantees have an average duration of five years.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Eligible small business owners, enterprises in the start-up phase, technology-oriented SMEs or SMEs<lb/> awaiting reorganisation can also obtain loans from the SBC at a low interest rate. The total policy funds<lb/> allocated in 2007 amounted to KRW 12 trillion (0.16% of GDP). In addition, Bank of Korea&apos;s regulation<lb/> on loan operation of financial institutions calls for banks to allocate more than 60% of their loan increases<lb/> to SMEs. Since 2004, an insurance programme, the Account Receivable Insurance Programme, has been<lb/> set up to protect SMEs against failure to collect payment and risks of resulting bankruptcies.<lb/> The Korean government puts strong emphasis upon venture capital markets as a primary source of<lb/> funds for financing start-ups and high-growth businesses. To revitalise the supply of finance to SMEs, the<lb/> government has supported the venture capital market by creating venture capital investment funds, setting<lb/> up venture capital firms and venture capital partnerships. In 2006, the SMBA planned to create<lb/> USD 500 million worth of venture investment funds, by setting up 102 venture capital firms and<lb/> 400 venture capital partnerships. A &quot; fund of funds &quot; amounting to USD 1 billion was also created by the<lb/> government in 2004 to finance investment funds for venture businesses and therewith to meet long-term<lb/> financing needs of the capital market. SMBA is also trying to revitalise the venture capital market by<lb/> creating a USD 120 million active secondary fund aimed at buying the shares unlisted on KOSDAQ.<lb/> Since 1998 the government introduced tax benefits (including income tax reductions) to induce<lb/> individual investors to fund innovative SMEs. If an investment is made through a venture fund or through<lb/> an association of individual investors, 10% of the amount invested (or 50% of the gross annual income) is<lb/> deducted from the gross income if the investment is over a period of more than five years. If an investment<lb/> is made in a company that was founded or transformed within the last three years, resulting capital gains<lb/> are exempt from tax if the investment is over a period of five years. The Korea Business Angel Network<lb/> (KBAN) provides support for venture investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Better access to entrepreneurial education and training<lb/></head>

			<p>A key element in Korea&apos;s entrepreneurship and SME policies has been the promotion of business<lb/> start-ups through: entrepreneurship training, enhancing entrepreneurial spirit and providing young,<lb/> would-be entrepreneurs with assistance to succeed in starting their business.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both short-term and long-term entrepreneurship training programmes have been set up. Since 2004,<lb/> five universities in Korea (notably Hoseo University and Jungang University) have launched a five-year<lb/> pilot entrepreneurship programme, &quot; Entrepreneur Graduate Schools &quot; , to train &quot; start-up specialists &quot; . The<lb/> education programme called &quot; Start-up Course &quot; created in 2002 on the other hand is a short-term training<lb/> provided by local universities and specialised institutes. The course is designed to improve management<lb/> skills of entrepreneurs and therewith to raise the start-up success rate. Around 100 courses are offered each<lb/> year. In addition, a special &quot; Technology start-up programme &quot; was set up in universities in 2005 to target<lb/> potential entrepreneurs with technological knowledge. It includes customised support programmes,<lb/> training and network-building at the pre start-up stage. About 300 graduates benefit from the programme<lb/> every year, 50% of them starting their business following the completion of the course.<lb/></p>

			<p>Entrepreneurship development programmes have been set up both at secondary and tertiary level to<lb/> raise the entrepreneurial mindset in youth. The &quot; Biz-cool programme &quot; , created in 2003 for teenagers, has<lb/> been implemented in middle and high schools as a pilot project. By 2007, more than 150 000 students had<lb/> benefitted from the programme (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.10). The course includes financial education, self-management,<lb/> business start-up and business administration and aims to develop students&apos; business mentality and<lb/> entrepreneurial spirit. It has also evolved from conventional lectures to practical courses involving visits to<lb/> SMEs and start-up simulation.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 1.10.

College students are<lb/> trained as future entrepreneurs, enhancing creativity and frontier spirit. Currently more than 960 of these<lb/> clubs exist in over 370 universities and have reached about 16 000 students.<lb/></table>

			<p>Efforts have also been made to upgrade the quality of the SME workforce. The first SME center, a<lb/> public education institute, was set up in 1982 in Ansan City to improve the work skills of SME employees<lb/> at an affordable cost. In addition, three regional centers were established recently. The centers provide<lb/> about 800 different short-term in-house training programmes ranging from production technology,<lb/> IT/automotion, quality assurance to digital technology. In 2007, 69 025 SME employees benefitted from<lb/> this training.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Finally, SMBA is supporting part of the expenses linked to consulting services provided to SMEs.<lb/> Consulting firms need to register with SMBA to provide services including advice on business model,<lb/> management and technology to start-ups lacking administrative skills and know-how. By 2007,<lb/> 176 consulting firms were collaborating with SMBA. Government funds allocated to this programme<lb/> amounted to USD 2.9 million in 2007 compared to USD 1 million in 2002.<lb/></figure>

			<head>III.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>Korea has placed entrepreneurship and SME policy at the core of governmental action for over a<lb/> decade. A special institution responsible for small and medium enterprises (SMBA) was created in 1996<lb/> and a Presidential Commission was set up in 1998, showing the determination to have a comprehensive,<lb/> well-designed and well-coordinated policy approach. Although a myriad of programmes have been created<lb/> for various SME categories, policy has mainly promoted innovative start-ups and supported industrial<lb/> SMEs in upgrading their innovation potential.<lb/> Entrepreneurship policy has rightly focused on facilitating access to finance both directly, through the<lb/> creation of an extensive credit guarantee scheme, and indirectly, through the venture capital markets. Many<lb/> programmes have also strengthened innovative activity, increasing ICT use by SMEs, facilitating the<lb/> commercialisation of research, creating knowledge networks to unleash the innovation potential of SMEs.<lb/> The introduction of entrepreneurial education at school and at universities in 2003 and the creation of<lb/> business incubators at universities have strengthened innovation trends further. Initiatives over the past<lb/> three years have increased networking opportunities and local knowledge diffusion. As a result,<lb/> entrepreneurial activity in Korea has been dynamic with stable birth rates and declining death rates for<lb/> firms. The average life of firms has thus lengthened.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is nonetheless room for using entrepreneurship and SME policy further to activate the potential<lb/> of the innovation system. SME and entrepreneurship policies have been overly ambitious in attempting to<lb/> address various needs of small business. This lack of policy focus has raised problems of overlapping and<lb/> co-ordination between different ministries and government agencies. In addition, it has led to a lack of<lb/> clear and overarching policy priorities helping SMEs to restructure and increase their competitiveness and<lb/> innovation potential.<lb/></p>

			<p>Indicators point to a duality in the firm population, meaning that policies need to address both helping<lb/> larger firms in the manufacturing sector keep their competitive edge, while allowing smaller firms, notably<lb/> in the services sector, to catch up in terms of productivity rates. An efficient infrastructure of business<lb/> services providing differentiated support and training would allow easier diffusion of knowledge in the<lb/> business sector. Results on the output of codified knowledge show that Korea is far from receiving the full<lb/> benefits from its high investment in R&amp;D. This implies that there is large scope to improve networks<lb/> between the different actors of the innovation framework.<lb/></p>

			<head>The need for stronger networks to spread knowledge and reap the benefits from R&amp;D<lb/></head>

			<p>As reflected by the high level of R&amp;D expenditure, innovation has been a strong policy priority in<lb/> Korea for over a decade. <ref type="biblio">Programmes</ref> have focused on supporting innovative start-ups and upgrading the<lb/> innovation potential of existing SMEs. The Technology Transfer Promotion Act was adopted in 2000 to<lb/> increase the commercialisation potential of research. The Inno-Biz Programme and the SME Technology<lb/> Innovation Programme were introduced in 2001. The 2002 Digital Innovation Consortium and the SME IT<lb/> implementation programmes aimed to improve use of ICT by small enterprises. More recent policy<lb/> initiatives have strengthened networking activities, through an increased information exchange between<lb/> business and research sectors, between large and small enterprises (2006 Act on Promoting Cooperation<lb/> between Large companies and SMEs), through the creation of regional clusters (2005 Innovative Cluster<lb/> City Policy).<lb/></figure>

			<p>A number of indicators, however, suggest that Korea is not reeping the full benefits from the<lb/> continuous increase in government and business R&amp;D expenditure. Expenditure is concentrated on a<lb/> limited number of firms in the manufacturing sector and outcomes of research are more geared towards<lb/> product than process innovations. This raises concerns as Korea approaches the technology frontiers in<lb/> different areas and firms need to develop their own technological capabilities. The innovation potential of<lb/> the services sector is largely untapped – in 2001 the services sector accounted for only 13% of business<lb/> R&amp;D – and productivity in this sector is unusually low.<lb/> Korea&apos;s innovation system would greatly benefit from collaborative (collective process) innovations<lb/> taking the form of deeper and wider networking among academia, research centers, business development<lb/> centers and the business sector. The current insufficient co-operation between the business sector and<lb/> universities or government research institutes means that there is little entrepreneurial attempt to<lb/> commercialise the findings of public research and that the technology transfer from the public to the<lb/> private sector is low. This also acts as a barrier to the mobility of researchers who are deterred from<lb/> entering business laboratories. Making potential entrepreneurs aware of support options and helping them<lb/> to apply for assistance or make the most of credit funds could ease barriers to firm creation. Concentrating<lb/> efforts on building an infrastructure disseminating the findings of research and providing subsequent<lb/> business advice would thus be a major step in augmenting Korea&apos;s collaborative innovation potential.<lb/> Stimulating growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity also involves increasing vertical network-<lb/>building between SMEs and large enterprises to spread chain-based innovations. Korea could build further<lb/> on the co-operation between SMEs and large enterprises with well-designed vertical suppliers&apos;<lb/> development programmes integrating SMEs in vertical supply chains. Such links in services would notably<lb/> allow raising productivity levels in this sector and reversing the rising bipolarity between small and large<lb/> enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to spread scientific and technological knowledge, enhanced horizontal collaboration between<lb/> SMEs in the same sector could be further strengthened by using best practice and building on clustering<lb/> activities. This would also involve building an efficient infrastructure of differentiated business services<lb/> managed by public or private institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Changing cultural attitudes towards entrepreneurship through education and training<lb/></head>

			<p>Entrepreneurial education for aspiring entrepreneurs and basic entrepreneurial training courses for<lb/> actual entrepreneurs are known to be highly efficient in overcoming psychological barriers to firm creation<lb/> and in removing inefficiencies in the production process. Entrepreneurship education has received<lb/> increasing attention since 2003 with the creation of the Biz-cool programme for secondary and tertiary<lb/> level and the launching of two-year pilot entrepreneurship programmes at universities (Entrepreneur<lb/> Graduate Schools). Short-term training is also provided by universities or specialised institutes to improve<lb/> management skills of entrepreneurs.<lb/> Although significant progress has been made in the domain of education and training in half a decade,<lb/> there is still room for improvement. Cultural values are traditionally rather reticent towards firm creation.<lb/> Starting a business has been and is still perceived as a difficult and risky project. In addition, the success<lb/> rate of businesses created by highly skilled entrepreneurs such as researchers and professors has not been<lb/> as high as expected, acting as a deterrent for well-educated individuals to start their own business.<lb/></p>

			<p>To reverse this trend and attract potential entrepreneurs into self-employment a better support<lb/> infrastructure is needed (business incubators, business development centers, expert consulting services) in<lb/> order to encourage firm creation and reduce the risk of failure. Surveys 39 show that the image of small<lb/> business in Korean society is still relatively low management instability, poor working environment and<lb/> low competitiveness. This calls for increased entrepreneurship education opportunities for younger<lb/> generations to change public knowledge and social perception of entrepreneurial activities.<lb/> In addition, there is a need to invest more in human capital at the tertiary education level to succeed in<lb/> the educational domain and ensure an adequate supply of high-skilled human capital, strengthening<lb/> innovation trends. Educational opportunities should also be extended to all segments of the firm population<lb/> through differentiated training opportunities in order to help inefficient micro firms raise their productivity<lb/> level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improved financial infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>Korea has set up a comprehensive financial system to support start-up businesses and SMEs through a<lb/> strong national credit guarantee system and a relatively high level of early stage venture capital. Yet, it is<lb/> still difficult for entrepreneurs to obtain a bank loan without collateral, real interest rates still remain<lb/> relatively high and international indicators (<ref type="biblio">FORA, 2007</ref>) suggest that it is comparatively difficult for<lb/> entrepreneurs to raise funds for risky projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>The credit guarantee scheme has facilitated access to finance for a high number of beneficiaries.<lb/> However, insufficient analysis of credit risks has allowed a number of SMEs recording losses to survive<lb/> and the extension of the term of credit guarantees has delayed the restructuring of the small enterprise<lb/> sector, eroding the competitiveness and independence of SMEs. This aid needs to be reduced by rescaling<lb/> credit guarantees through the introduction of a better credit rating system and increased expertise in<lb/> assessing loan applications from firms that have no or little collateral. This would improve the selection of<lb/> beneficiaries and shorten the duration of the credit schemes.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the 1997 &quot; Act on Special Measures for the Promotion of Venture Businesses &quot; the government<lb/> has aimed to develop the venture business sector to shift the weight of the economy to start-ups in<lb/> knowledge-based industries. The government jump-started the venture capital market by providing equity<lb/> capital from the public sector, generous tax incentives for venture capitalists and equity guarantees.<lb/> Venture capital investments were centered on firms certified by government and receiving a number of<lb/> benefits (reduced minimum capital requirement, tax exemptions, loans for start-ups, credit guarantees<lb/> relaxed listing for KOSDAQ).<lb/> So far, the role played by individual investors (business angels) and pension funds has been limited as<lb/> the capital market is still relying heavily on the injection of government funds. To create a well-functioning<lb/> financial system, the role played by the government needs to be gradually phased-out. The private sector&apos;s<lb/> 39<lb/></p>

			<p>Survey undertaken by SBC in 2003 on the perceived role of SMEs in the economy.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> 44<lb/> role in venture funding on the other hand should be increased. Leveraging and diversifying private sources<lb/> of venture capital would allow moving small firms away from the dependence on public debt guarantees<lb/> and public funding.<lb/></p>

			<head>Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>Many steps have been taken to lift impediments to the creation and expansion of innovative firms.<lb/> Korea has also been active in the area of education and training, as entrepreneurship has been introduced in<lb/> the curricula to improve skills of actual and potential entrepreneurs. The need for a focused, balanced and<lb/> well-coordinated entrepreneurship and SME strategy nonetheless remains.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are signs that Korea may not be benefitting from the high level of public and private R&amp;D<lb/> investment due to insufficient collective process innovations. To release the innovative capacity of the<lb/> system and facilitate the emergence of innovative start-ups, policy would need to focus on network<lb/> building, improving scientific-technological networks and facilitating the creation of vertical and<lb/> horizontal links between enterprises. This can be achieved through broadened support programmes<lb/> (including the non-industrial sector) and an extended range of differentiated business support services,<lb/> reducing the productivity gap between services and manufacturing sectors, between small and large<lb/> enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite efforts to ease access to finance for small enterprises and start-ups through extensive credit<lb/> guarantee scheme and the regular injection of government funds into the venture capital market, there are<lb/> still major impediments to firm creation in this area of policy intervention. It is difficult for entrepreneurs<lb/> to access collateral-free funds, and real interest rates remain high relative to Korea&apos;s achievement in terms<lb/> of per capita convergence.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, success in the entrepreneurial domain will only be ensured if Korea invests further in<lb/> entrepreneurial education and training to reverse psychological barriers to firm creation. This calls for<lb/> increased entrepreneurship education opportunities for younger generations based on best practice. These<lb/> need to be complemented by easing entry barriers for start-ups and extending business support services to<lb/> reduce the risk of failure when starting a business.<lb/></p>

			<figure>MEXICO<lb/> Introduction<lb/> Over the past few years, Mexico has placed rising emphasis on entrepreneurship policy as a principal<lb/> means of stimulating innovation. Ongoing globalisation and the associated shift to a knowledge-based<lb/> economy have revived worldwide interest in firm creation as a major agent of innovation. Entrepreneurship<lb/> policy affects the whole range of entrepreneurial activities, including the pre-start, start up and post-start up<lb/> phases of enterprise life. 40<lb/></figure>

			<p>The link between entrepreneurial policy and innovation is, by nature, indirect. Efficient measures of<lb/> entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation and growth. In doing so, they strengthen innovative<lb/> activity. Policy lead times, though, vary with the type of entrepreneurship policy. For instance, introducing<lb/> entrepreneurship education in schools and universities is bound to affect innovation trends only in the<lb/> longer run. The same is true of reducing cultural biases against entrepreneurial activities. In contrast, more<lb/> immediate effects may spring from dismantling barriers to finance as well as setting up well-focused<lb/> training courses for both subsistence entrepreneurs and business counsellors (teachers training<lb/> programmes).<lb/> Viewed from a wider angle, the design of entrepreneurship policy itself may constitute an<lb/> &apos;innovation&apos;, augmenting the effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on individual<lb/> innovations. Mexico, as will be shown in this chapter, exemplifies this approach, using policy-induced<lb/> collective process innovation as a main vehicle for stimulating individual product, process and market<lb/> innovation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first part of this chapter highlights salient features of Mexico&apos;s enterprise population, identifies<lb/> main obstacles to entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The<lb/> second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes, in<lb/> four major areas of policy intervention: access to R&amp;D and technology, access to finance, capabilities and<lb/> access to skilled labour, and cultural values. The third part provides an evaluation of entrepreneurship<lb/> policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation<lb/></head>

			<p>Mexico&apos;s enterprise population is highly polarised, myriads of inefficient micro firms (abundance of<lb/> subsistence entrepreneurs) co-existing with few efficient small, medium-sized and larger firms (growth-<lb/>oriented entrepreneurs). There are around 6 700 large and medium-sized enterprises and nearly 4 million<lb/> micro firms in the formal economy, most of which are unprofitable. The informal economy includes about<lb/> the same number of micro firms.<lb/> Suffering from under endowment of tangible and intangible capital, overstaffing and consequent<lb/> negative levels of total factor productivity, micro firms account for much of Mexico&apos;s overall productivity<lb/> weakness. Notwithstanding macroeconomic stability, aggregate productivity has risen more slowly over<lb/></p>

			<figure>40<lb/> OECD (2005), SME and Entrepreneurship Outlook.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> the ten years to 2005 than in any other OECD country. For a country with a low per capita income and<lb/> correspondingly large catching-up opportunities, this outcome is paradoxical (Annex 2.A, Figure 2.A.1).<lb/></figure>

			<head>1.<lb/> Main characteristics of the enterprise sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The Mexican enterprise sector is characterised by the disparity between the competitive and export-<lb/>oriented 6 700 large and medium-sized enterprises and the often unprofitable and inefficient 4 million<lb/> micro firms. 41 The diversity of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) population is reflected in the<lb/> regional disparities in terms of social and economic development. For each of the three major economic<lb/> sectors – manufacturing, retail and services – the regional pattern shows a particularly dominant presence<lb/> of micro-firms in the South-eastern regions. By contrast, large and medium-sized firms display a relatively<lb/> strong presence in the more prosperous Northern regions. 42 The regional distribution of GDP per capita in<lb/> Mexico is amongst the least equal compared to other OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.1). Benefits of Mexico&apos;s<lb/> increasing integration into the global economy have been unevenly distributed with some states being<lb/> better placed than others for reaping the fruits of better access to international markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data points to a fragmented production structure and a highly polarised profile of employment<lb/> and productivity levels. The typical firm is small and mostly family owned and run. About nine tenth are<lb/> located in retail, services and agriculture and their output is oriented towards local markets. Only a small<lb/> share of micro-firms are located in manufacturing (just over 300 000); they are on the other hand very<lb/> present in retail trade (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.1). In contrast, a small segment of internationally competitive firms that are<lb/> mainly situated in the metropolitan areas of Mexico and Monterrey are endowed with modern equipment<lb/> and with a strong culture of innovation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The average survival time of newly created firms is short, a substantial portion of them closing down<lb/> before two years after birth. Many firms are unable to generate profits reflecting negative levels of total<lb/> factor productivity. Unaware of available government support, they do not participate in &quot; association<lb/> networks &quot; and continue to suffer from low levels of human capital, limited access to finance and<lb/> inadequate use of technology. Their contribution to the total output is weak.<lb/> Finally, a significant portion of Mexico&apos;s working force is active in the informal economy.<lb/> Employment in the informal sector was estimated at 10.5 million people in 2002, representing about one<lb/> quarter of the whole labour force. 43<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Factors driving firm creation and expansion<lb/></head>

			<p>A web of chronic impediments stifle firm creation, including lack of R&amp;D benefits, lack of finance,<lb/> shortage of skilled labour, high-quality education, training and business services. These obstacles are<lb/> particularly strong for small and micro firms weighed down by under equipment of tangible and intangible<lb/> capital.<lb/></p>

			<head>43<lb/></head>

			<p>The statistical office INEGI has started to produce a defined measure of the informal sector which<lb/> considers employment and output of « non-structured » sectors such as street vendors and or<lb/> micro-enterprises. <ref type="biblio">See OECD (2007)</ref>, SMEs in Mexico, Paris.<lb/></p>

			<head>a)<lb/> Access to new technology and R&amp;D<lb/></head>

			<p>Mexico&apos;s technological gap (as measured by the diffusion of information and communication<lb/> technology, ICTs) is sizeable, even considering its position as a low per-capita income country (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.2).<lb/> In 2003, Mexico significantly lagged behind Turkey (a country with a comparably low per capita income)<lb/> in terms of standard access lines, access channels and mobile subscribers. While prices are high compared<lb/> to other OECD countries (Annex 2.A, Figures 2.A.2 and 3) the technological gap mainly reflects low<lb/> awareness of ICT presenting profitable business opportunities. Moreover, inadequate R&amp;D efforts account<lb/> for weak trends in product and process innovation. R&amp;D expenditure, though rising from 0.3% in 2001 to<lb/> 0.5% of GDP in 2005, is still low by international standards (the OECD average being 2.2% in 2005).<lb/> R&amp;D weakness is notably pronounced in the domain of private business: private R&amp;D spending accounts<lb/> for only one-third of Mexico&apos;s total R&amp;D expenditure, the corresponding ratio for the OECD being<lb/> roughly twice as large. Overall, private R&amp;D spending amounted to 0.2% of GDP in 2005 as against 1.5%<lb/> for the OECD area.<lb/></p>

			<p>Access to business finance has been difficult. <ref type="biblio">In 1996-2003</ref>, Mexico&apos;s bank overhead costs and net<lb/> interest margins were, on average, among the highest in the OECD area (Annex 2.A, Figures 2.A.4 and 5),<lb/> a sign of ingrained banking inefficiency. While both nominal and real interest rates have fallen since 2000<lb/> they have stayed well above US levels (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.3).

			<p>Notwithstanding progress, lack of financing at a reasonable cost has kept on undermining<lb/> entrepreneurial activity. While the growth of direct bank credit to enterprises rebounded strongly in<lb/> 2004-2005, 44 it became subsequently unstable (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.6). Overall, bank lending to the private sector<lb/> (including mortgage and consumer credit) has remained among the lowest in the OECD area.<lb/></p>

			<p>Inside the business sector, financing is marked by sharp asymmetries between large and small<lb/> companies. Small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing the greatest difficulties in accessing bank<lb/> 44<lb/></p>

			<p>After the crisis in 1995 bank profitability recovered in Mexico and non-performing loans declined. Growth<lb/> in domestic credit to the private sector was however slow to recover: bank credit to the private sector<lb/> exhibited negative real annual growth throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s except for a brief<lb/> period in 1998.<lb/> financing given their higher risk and lack of access to foreign borrowing. While larger companies in<lb/> tradable sectors have access to bank credit, SMEs rely mainly on costly suppliers&apos; credit. 45 This has<lb/> adverse effects on investment and innovation activities. In 2005, suppliers&apos; credit accounted for two-thirds<lb/> of finance for small enterprises (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.4). In comparison, banks are in nearly 80% of cases the main<lb/> source of financing for EU-based SMEs. 46<lb/></p>

			<p>The supply of bank credit to the business sector has been further limited due to the longstanding lack<lb/> of adequate rules for recovering guarantees and to the uncertainties about the application of the new legal<lb/> framework following the 2003 reform. 47 Shortcomings in the application of the bankruptcy and credit<lb/> guarantee law and in credit assessment affect smaller firms more acutely than larger firms, creating<lb/> important asymmetries.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Access to capabilities and to skilled labour<lb/></head>

			<p>Human capital is still the lowest in the OECD due to a grossly underperforming educational system.<lb/> Over the past decades, Mexico has made major progress in increasing school enrolment. While the volume<lb/> of educational services has increased, there are doubts about whether the additional funding is delivering<lb/> expected results. Both the quality and coverage of educational services remain far behind OECD best<lb/> practices. Mexican children still spend comparatively few years in formal education and do not benefit<lb/> from it as much as they should. Many children, especially the poor ones, still leave school before<lb/> completing compulsory education. Literacy and numerical skills of students are by far the lowest of all<lb/> OECD countries (Annex 2.A, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.A.6 on average PISA 48 scores in reading, mathematics and science).<lb/> More so than in other OECD countries, the poor educational attainment of the working-age population is<lb/> reproduced from one generation to the next (Annex 2.A, <ref type="figure">Figures 2.A.7 and 8).<lb/></ref> The transition between school and work also presents some major weaknesses with students being<lb/> unable to find jobs matching their skills. Reforms were launched in 2004 to better match the curricula of<lb/> the various systems of professional schooling with the needs of the productive sector. OECD experience<lb/> shows that close connections between professional schools and the business sector are appropriate.<lb/> 45<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Bonturi, M.

			<p>In addition, Mexico like several other OECD countries has a low training culture for adults with only<lb/> a small share of employees (often the most qualified workers and employees of larger firms) being<lb/> involved in training programmes. While cultural perceptions about entrepreneurial activity are generally<lb/> positive, opportunities for entrepreneurship education continue to be sparse. In firms, the lack of innovative<lb/> momentum often reflects &quot; old style &quot; management preventing both the hiring of highly qualified managers<lb/> and purchases of sophisticated business services.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> 1.<lb/> Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Entrepreneurship policy makers have been facing the complex task of lifting a highly fragile and<lb/> heterogenous firm population out of structural weakness. Adopting a strong and flexible policy approach,<lb/></p>

			<figure>Mexico designed a new policy framework in 2000 aimed at making enterprises more efficient. The 2000<lb/> Entrepreneurial Development Plan (EDP), created within the National Development Programme (NDP)<lb/> (2001-06), served as a central axis for the government&apos;s new economic policy (Box 2.1).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The EDP called on stakeholders of entrepreneurship policy (Federal, State, local governments, private<lb/> sector associations and research communities) to co-operate and develop joint strategies to strengthen the<lb/> business sector. With this aim in mind, the federal government progressively put into place mechanisms<lb/> apt to improve participatory processes and vertical and horizontal policy co-ordination. In the process,<lb/> administrative powers were decentralised, creating room for state and local governments and<lb/> intermediaries to shape and implement entrepreneurship projects.<lb/> Policy emphasis was initially placed upon lessening severe financial constraints hindering firm<lb/> creation and firm expansion. Micro finance was seen as a key route to supplying funds to firms which<lb/> normally have no access to traditional banking (subsistence entrepreneurs). Subsequently, though, <ref type="biblio">(2004)</ref>,<lb/> the focus of entrepreneurship policy was shifted towards innovation. Innovation became the central policy<lb/> axis permeating each policy category and releasing various externalities through cross-fertilisation. The<lb/> new, incoming government (<ref type="biblio">December 2006</ref>) further reinforced the innovation-oriented stance of<lb/> entrepreneurship and SME policies, establishing in 2007 the Fund for Technological Innovation (Fondo de<lb/> Innovacion Technologica).<lb/> Building on concepts and recommendations from the Oslo Manual (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 1999</ref>) and current<lb/> innovation theory, the 2004 strategy of entrepreneurship encouragement identifies five forms of<lb/> innovation (market, product, process, organisational and business innovation). It also seeks to identify the<lb/> impact of innovation by distinguishing between incremental effects (marginal gains from process<lb/> improvements) and powerful effects from radically new products and processes (incremental versus radical<lb/> innovation).<lb/> In this framework, strong emphasis has been placed on networking as a form of collective process<lb/> innovation (collaborative innovation). Social capital is seen as a vital innovation asset capable of<lb/> improving enterprises&apos; access to knowledge services, financial resources and technology. As a result,<lb/> institutions began to speed up and broaden the flow of information, diffusing best practices, innovation<lb/> tools and technology. The collective innovation approach is based on the idea that firms influence the local<lb/> business culture, creating trade links and easing risks of innovation failures. Besides, knowledge-intensive<lb/> business services (interlinkers) are seen to create and strengthen a supportive environment for business<lb/> activities by providing firms with access to venture capital, skilled labour, technical assistance, other<lb/> experienced entrepreneurs and educational institutions. The policy also recognised the productive and<lb/> geographical diversity of Mexico&apos;s enterprises (systemic model for growth). Although different regions<lb/> have different needs, some may take innovative policy initiatives which others may choose to emulate.<lb/> The federal government&apos;s main tool for shaping and implementing innovation-oriented<lb/> entrepreneurship policy measures has been the SME Fund (Fondo Pyme) established in 2004. The SME<lb/> Fund is run by the Under Ministry for SMEs created in 2001. In line with best practices, the Fund applies<lb/> the principle of co-financing, having firms contribute their own resources for innovation-related projects.<lb/> The SME Fund disburses subsidies through various intermediaries, including universities, R&amp;D and<lb/> technology centres, chambers, associations and foundations. Variable and temporary public-private<lb/> partnerships have thus become a central element of entrepreneurship policies. The government has relied<lb/> upon a &apos;trigger approach&apos;, imparting central policy impulses with a view to releasing widespread policy<lb/> effects (&apos;multiplier function&apos;). The Fund for Technological Innovation (2007) complements the SME<lb/> Fund&apos;s innovation-oriented operations (see below).<lb/> Since its inception, the SME Fund has drawn up a comprehensive set of support programmes, some of<lb/> them directly spurring incubation of business invention and innovation (Box 2.2) (<ref type="biblio">OECD, SMEs in<lb/> Mexico, 2007</ref>). These programmes seek to stimulate innovations through better access to new technology,<lb/> R&amp;D benefits and finance, while also offering better opportunities for entrepreneurial training and<lb/> education. The SME</p>

			<figure>Fund&apos;s budget totalled an estimated US 200 million in 2006.<lb/> Since April 2007, the SME Fund&apos;s innovation-oriented programmes have been backed up by the Fund<lb/> for Technological Innovation (2007). Run by the Ministry of the Economy and the National Research<lb/> Council (CONACYT) and endowed with USD 55 million, the new Fund supports innovation projects<lb/> under three strategic &apos;support lines&apos;: Development and technological innovation; creation and<lb/> consolidation of groups or centres pursuing activities of engineering, design, research and technological<lb/> development; and association-sponsored efforts of technological innovation. The guiding principle of the<lb/> Fund&apos;s operations is a prompt transmutation of R&amp;D benefits (inventions) into innovations through<lb/> entrepreneurial activity. To this end, it promotes interactions between the business sector and the research<lb/> community.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> Box 2.2.

			<head>2.<lb/> Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovation activities<lb/> a)<lb/> Better access to new technology and R&amp;D benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>The Mexican government views deepened and expanded networking linkages among different<lb/> enterprise support units (business incubators, innovation laboratories, business development centres,<lb/> centres of productive articulation), intermediate organisations and different levels of government as a<lb/> condition sine qua non for accelerating the flow of new technology and R&amp;D benefits. Effective webs of<lb/> connections act as catalysts for diffusing new technology and rendering tailor-made initiatives of<lb/> entrepreneurship policy more efficient. Networking programmes are thus seen as a kind of collective<lb/> process innovation. Under this policy, activities of vertical networking have relied on both &apos;top-down&apos; and<lb/> &apos;bottom-up&apos; approaches.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Programme for Innovation and Technological Development<lb/></head>

			<p>Put into place after the establishment of the SME Fund in 2004, the programme supports innovative<lb/> and R&amp;D activities by way of augmenting the firm&apos;s ability to absorb and access new technology and<lb/> specialised knowledge. The Programme for Innovation and Technological Development strives to establish<lb/> links between firms and principal centres of applied research and technological development. Its lines of<lb/> action mainly concern mature and fast-growing SMEs (HGSMEs). Sustained expansion of these firms<lb/> often requires linkages with national and international networks. To this end, the programmes favour the<lb/> creation of two kinds of enterprise support units:</p>

			<table>business accelerators (Aceleradores de Negocios) and<lb/> innovation laboratories (Laboratorios de Innovacion en Nichos Especializados).<lb/> • Business accelerators are all those organisations, institutions and specialised enterprises<lb/> capable of identifying, assisting and financing technically-oriented firms during their<lb/> expansion phase. In this capacity, business accelerators help HGSMEs strengthen innovative<lb/> efforts, conquer new markets at home and abroad, attract business angels&apos; investment and<lb/> become part of international value chains. As a result, a web of business accelerators has<lb/> been gradually built up since 2004 consisting in 2006 of six national units (three privately<lb/> run accelerators and three units run by institutions of higher education) and four<lb/> international accelerators.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> • Innovation laboratories are run by Higher education institutions and centres of applied<lb/> research and act as service providers supporting firms&apos; R&amp;D efforts and innovative<lb/> activities. In 2005, a network of innovation laboratories was set up, connecting all<lb/> laboratories specialised in the design, prototyping and testing of micro electronic<lb/> mechanisms MEMS (e.g. States of Puebla, Chihuahu and Mexico City). The Programme for<lb/> Innovation and Technological Development has also promoted the transfer of technology<lb/> from large to smaller firms in the automobile industry and underpinned the formation of<lb/> clusters for robots and automation.<lb/></table>

			<head>The National System of Business Incubators<lb/></head>

			<p>Partially inspired by successful foreign programmes, in 2003 the federal government launched a<lb/> business incubator programme (the National System of Business Incubators) aimed at lengthening the life<lb/> of newly created enterprises. Previously, more than 50% of newly created firms went out of business two<lb/> years after birth. The National System of Business Incubators (2003) offers a wide range of support<lb/> services, including feasibility studies of market opportunities and administrative services including offices,<lb/> skilled labour and information about access to finance and new technology. Services offered by business<lb/> incubators appeal particularly to young entrepreneurs. About 80% of entrepreneurs using business<lb/> incubators are 25-35 years old.<lb/></p>

			<head>There are three variants of business incubators.<lb/></head>

			<p>• The traditional one assisting the birth of firms in traditional sectors with standard material<lb/> and immaterial input requirements. The usual incubation period for this category is about<lb/> three months and at most six months.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The second variant (intermediate technology incubator) assists the birth of those firms which<lb/> require knowledge inputs from specialised institutions, large firms and strategic innovation<lb/> networks. The usual incubation period is between 12 and 18 months.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The third variant (high technology incubator) supports nascent firms in the domain of<lb/> information technology, biotechnology, microelectronics, wireless technologies, robots,<lb/> automation, nanotechnology and new, high-quality materials (e.g. ceramics). The normal<lb/> incubation period for this category is about two years.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since its inception in 2003 and up til 2007, the incubator programme led to the creation of<lb/> 423 business incubators, which, in almost equal proportions (nearly one half), specialise in the use of<lb/> traditional and intermediate technology (first and second variants). High-technology incubators account for<lb/> less than 5% of the total. The incubators, in turn, induced the creation of 5 676 firms in 2003-2007, more<lb/> than half of which use intermediate technology. High-technology firms accounted for 5% of incubator-<lb/>induced new businesses (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>			<figure>.5). About 60% of financial support (an estimated USD 20 million) has<lb/> come from the Federal, State and local governments, the remainder (USD 10 million) being financed by<lb/> academia and the private sector. The average financial support per incubator-induced firm creation totalled<lb/> USD 5 500 in 2004-2007.<lb/> To ensure the continuity of the incubator programme, an autonomous National Council of Business<lb/> Incubators (Consejo Nacional de Incubadoras de Empresas) was established. This council acts as a<lb/> &apos;window&apos; for obtaining information about business incubators, paving the way for a national network of<lb/> business incubators.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<head>b)<lb/> Better access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the Entrepreneurial Development Plan (EDP) for 2001-06, better access to finance has been a<lb/> key lever for strengthening entrepreneurship and enterprise development. Accordingly, the authorities<lb/> swiftly established grids of financial support lines extending credit guarantees at reduced cost. Financial<lb/> institutions were called upon to create, modify and consolidate financial instruments so as to meet highly<lb/> differentiated firms&apos; needs. These policy initiatives were strengthened and refined with the shift to an<lb/> innovation-based entrepreneurship policy in 2004.<lb/></p>

			<p>Three programmes emerged as main elements in the authorities&apos; endeavours to deepen and widen the<lb/> flow of financial funds to aspiring enterprises: The National Guarantee Programme; the National Financial<lb/> Extension Programme; and the Capital for Development Schemes.<lb/></p>

			<head>The National Guarantee System<lb/></head>

			<p>Creating new financial instruments in the form of guarantee funds, the National Guarantee System<lb/> (Sistema Nacional <ref type="biblio">de Garantia, 2003</ref>) has strongly raised supplies of affordable financial resources.<lb/> Adopting the portfolio approach, the Ministry of Economy enlarged the range of financial products,<lb/> portfolio lines becoming broader as a consequence. Guaranteed credits are mostly of a short-term nature,<lb/> nine-tenths of firms&apos; credit demand serving the purpose of financing working capital. The default rate of<lb/> Mexican guarantee programmes (0.92%) is far below the international standard of 5% pointing to low<lb/> levels of moral hazard.<lb/></p>

			<p>The distribution of risk between the Ministry of Economy, NAFIN (State Development Bank) and<lb/> financial institutions has been shown to be efficient. The operation of credit guarantee programmes has<lb/> also prompted private financial institutions to extend new loans to SMEs, while developing new financial<lb/> products. The associated rise in bank profitability has contributed to the establishment of new financial<lb/> institutions.<lb/> A bidding process for guarantee funds was started in 2005, kindling competition among financial<lb/> intermediaries keen to obtain loan guarantees. Under the bidding procedure, the amount of guarantee funds<lb/> rises with a rising leverage index and falling interest rates. In the previous setting, with direct provision of<lb/> guarantees, the leverage of SME Fund resources was only 2 pesos of credit for each peso of funding. The<lb/> auction technique raised the credit/fund ratios to 65 in 2007. Guarantee coverage falls into the range<lb/> between 60 and 80%, which is high enough to avoid the use of collateral requirements and sufficiently low<lb/> to escape from moral hazard. In 2003 and 2005, the flow of credit funds was also stimulated by new<lb/> legislation facilitating the recovery of collateral. Nevertheless, legal proceedings have remained costly and<lb/> long.<lb/></p>

			<head>The National Financial Extension Programme<lb/></head>

			<p>Established in 2004, the National Financial Extension Programme (Red Nacional de Extensionismo)<lb/> provides a financial assessment net, helping firms enter into credit relationships. During the first phase,<lb/> professional credit advisors assess the firm&apos;s financing needs, select the most suitable loan products and<lb/> assist entrepreneurs in their credit negotiations. In a second phase, they monitor the subsequent use of<lb/> credit funds.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Through their nationwide network of branches, commercial banks help firms in the process of<lb/> screening and improving credit applications. As a result, banks&apos; risks perceptions have decreased,<lb/> increasing supplies of pre-approved credits and lowering costs of credit approval. In 2006, the National<lb/> Financial Extension Programme reached nationwide coverage, with all 32 Mexican States participating in<lb/> the programme. Six hundred professional credit advisors, authorised by the Ministry of Economy, have<lb/> helped process firms&apos; credit applications and monitor the subsequent use of credit funds. In 2006, over<lb/> 8 000 firms benefited from cost-free credit advice and surveillance (0.3% of the firm population).<lb/></figure>

			<head>The Capital for Development Schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>Two sub-programmes serve the purpose of increasing the supply of venture capital for growth-<lb/>oriented entrepreneurs: the Seed Capital Programme (Programma Capital Semilla PYME) and the Fund of<lb/> Productive and Infrastructural Development Projects (FOPRODE). In addition, the authorities sponsor the<lb/> creation of investment clubs and other instruments to channel private venture capital to innovative firms.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<table>Under the Seed Capital Programme (2005), financial intermediaries and incubators release<lb/> capital funds for firm creation. The supply of venture capital ranges from USD 10 000 to<lb/> USD 200 000, depending upon the nature of planned firm creation (traditional, intermediate<lb/> and high-technology firms). This sub-programme targets potential entrepreneurs with little<lb/> or no experience in entrepreneurial activity. The Seed Capital Programme injects capital<lb/> under twin formulas of partnership capital and quasi-capital.<lb/></table>

			<p>񮽙 Under the partnership formula, entrepreneurs remain owners of their newly created<lb/> company. Seed capital is released for a period of up to four years, the business<lb/> incubator being the business associate. Financial resources are disbursed to the<lb/> business incubator centres, allowing them to enter into a contractual, strategic<lb/> partnership with the entrepreneur. Profits and losses are shared at the end of the<lb/> contract period. The success of this programme largely hinges upon business<lb/> incubators and intermediate organisations providing adequate follow-up to the<lb/> release of capital funds.<lb/></p>

			<table>񮽙 Under another variant of the Seed Capital Programme, quasi-capital is provided in<lb/> the form of a loan at a subsidised annual interest rate of 6%, the initial grace period<lb/> of 6, 12 or 18 months depending upon the nature of the planned enterprise<lb/> traditional, intermediate or high technology). This scheme can also be operated by<lb/> business incubator centres or financial intermediaries (non-bank banks).<lb/> Requirements for own funds are 20% for traditional firms and 15% for non-<lb/>traditional firms. Since the inception of this variant at the end of 2005, 302<lb/> entrepreneurs have benefited from this programme.<lb/> • The second sub-programme (FOPRODE) is a pilot project programme (2004) providing<lb/> funds between USD 25 000 and USD 100 000</table>

			<p>over a period of three to four years at a<lb/> subsidised interest rate of 6% with a grace period of one year. FOPRODE mainly supports<lb/> prospective innovative entrepreneurs with no proven entrepreneurial background, no credit<lb/> file, no credit guarantees and no collateral. The FOPRODE programme is operated and<lb/> managed by an intermediate organisation with national coverage, allowing local<lb/> governments to participate. Local financial institutions are able to identify and evaluate<lb/> projects as well as to formalise credit contracts, manage and recover credit portfolios.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Investment proposals are received and assessed via an electronic window operating through<lb/> Internet. In 2006, more than 200 firms benefited from this scheme.<lb/> Another avenue used for supplying venture capital are Investors&apos; Clubs, which are &apos;civil<lb/> organisations&apos; composed of investors intent on realising high rates of return on capital through investments<lb/> in innovative firms. For individual members, investment clubs reduce operation costs and risks and<lb/> augment investment capacity. For entrepreneurs, investment clubs release private venture capital which is<lb/> otherwise unavailable. The PYME Option (2006) represents a unique type of investment guarantee<lb/> designed to spur the creation of investment clubs and venture capital funds geared towards early stage<lb/> investing.<lb/> Beneficiaries of PYME Option are firms engaged in innovative, high value added or export-oriented<lb/> activities or which are clearly oriented towards integration in industrial chains. PYME Option offers<lb/> investors flexible procedures to cover the risk in case of business failure. The amount of capital covered<lb/> has a ceiling of USD 500 000 and a limit of 70% of investment projects, a duration of coverage ranging<lb/> from three to five years.<lb/></figure>

			<head>c)<lb/> Better access to entrepreneurial education and training<lb/></head>

			<p>Some programmes shown in Box 2 focus on improving entrepreneurship education and training as<lb/> well as widening access to skilled labour and business services: the Business Development Centres<lb/> Network, the Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms&apos; Capabilities and the National Network of<lb/> Productive Articulation. The new, incoming government (<ref type="biblio">December 2006</ref>) has stepped up efforts to<lb/> broaden and upgrade entrepreneurial education so as to augment the participation in entrepreneurial<lb/> activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Business Development Centres Network<lb/></head>

			<p>Business development centres (<ref type="biblio">BDCs</ref> or Centros de Desarrollo Empresaria) are locally established<lb/> support units providing a wide range of basic and more sophisticated firm support services. Mexico&apos;s<lb/> BDCs provide &apos;business solutions&apos;, but no direct entrepreneurship training, e.g. helping firms draw up loan<lb/> requests based upon BDC assessment of financial needs. Services rendered by public BDCs are free of<lb/> charge, while private BDCs demand a moderate fee (OECD, SMEs in Mexico, 2007).<lb/> Sponsored by chambers of commerce, industry and educational institutions, BDCs have been<lb/> developed since 2001 as part of the 2001-2006 Entrepreneurial Development Plan (EDP). By the end of<lb/> 2007, public and private BDCs numbered more than 170.<lb/></figure>

			<p>There are two types of BDCs:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Conventional BDCs provide basic firm support services (especially to subsistence<lb/> entrepreneurs).<lb/> • BDCs Plus contribute to creating favourable framework conditions for innovative firms<lb/> (high-value-added investment projects, growth-oriented entrepreneurs).<lb/></table>

			<p>Since 2004, BDCs are subject to systematic monitoring by the SME Fund. The SME Fund has issued<lb/> terms of reference for what constitute &apos;standard&apos; or &apos;required&apos; BDC operations. These efforts at<lb/> harmonisation seek to augment BDC efficiency, paving the way for creating an effective network of BDCs.<lb/> Such a network tends to induce mutual learning processes triggered by information exchange.<lb/></p>

			<p>In pursuit of this aim, the SME Fund has helped establish pilot BDC groups, which exchange views<lb/> about how to run themselves more efficiently. A standardised management system has been designed<lb/> which BDCs need to apply in order to obtain operational authorisation from the Ministry of Economy.<lb/> Pilot groups have also identified efficient ways in which BDCs can employ e-learning and the Internet as a<lb/> platform for spreading entrepreneurship training programmes. The BDC approach adopted by the SME<lb/> Fund allows the most dynamic BDCs to be identified, enabling them, at a later stage, to grow into a strong<lb/> nucleus of the BDC network.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms&apos; Capabilities<lb/></head>

			<p>The second programme is concerned with opening access to education and training. This programme<lb/> aims at creating and upgrading entrepreneurial human capital allowing a better absorption of new<lb/> technologies in all areas of entrepreneurial activities (managerial and administrative skills as well as<lb/> marketing strategies). The programme facilitates access to training for owners and managers, especially of<lb/> micro firms (subsistence entrepreneurs): through this programme, consultants provide systematic and<lb/> methodological training to firms. Well-focused workshops and interviews with managers and workers,<lb/> however brief, have led to significant productivity improvements.<lb/> Since 2005, training options have been increasingly adapted to their potential impact on different<lb/> forms of innovation. The SME Fund also encouraged firms to participate in interactive processes of<lb/> information and knowledge exchanges, thereby stimulating the collective efficiency of different enterprise<lb/> groups. As noted above, Mexico&apos;s entrepreneurship policies consider collective efficiency as a vital<lb/> innovation asset.<lb/> The Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms&apos; Capabilities offers access to three types of<lb/> training: conventional training for administrative, commercial, financial and productive activities;<lb/> specialised training for product and process innovations; and training the &apos;coaches&apos;.<lb/> Special training efforts were also undertaken under the so-called PROMODE programme which helps<lb/> large numbers of potential subsistence entrepreneurs opening their retail shop. The target for 2006 was to<lb/> offer training support for as many as 160 000 firms in the retail sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>The National Network of Productive Articulation<lb/></head>

			<p>The third programme seeking to improve entrepreneurship education, training and business services is<lb/> the National Network of Centres of Productive Articulation (Centros de Articulacion Productiva, CAP). An<lb/> outgrowth of private initiatives, CAPs are micro or small business units (support units) acting as a hub for<lb/> rendering high-value-added business services to selected branches of industry, commerce and services. At<lb/> the end of 2005, CAPs totalled 81.<lb/> CAPs may serve to create databases of potential customers for producers of well-defined products and<lb/> services, allowing swift adaptation of design and production to changing consumer needs. CAPs also serve<lb/> to scrutinise investment projects of affiliated enterprises and help upgrade training of both entrepreneurs<lb/> and coaches. Finally, CAPs provide consultation services for potential network members, inducing &apos;would-<lb/>be&apos; entrepreneurs to become firm creators.<lb/></p>

			<head>d)<lb/> Reducing the cultural bias against entrepreneurial activity<lb/></head>

			<p>Entrepreneurship receives nation-wide attention during the annual week for SMEs, a national event.<lb/> The SME week has been successful in attracting 50 000 firms by providing on-the-spot information,<lb/> training and network opportunities. Mobile information centres (SME policy vans) spread information<lb/> about opportunities to benefit from government support. Finally, business fora, partly financed by the SME<lb/> Fund, are organised throughout the year, attracting &apos;would-be&apos; entrepreneurs. In 2004-06, close to 18 000<lb/> micro firms have been able to establish first contacts with bigger firms and institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>Faced with a strongly ailing firm population, Mexico has adopted a new, evolutionary and<lb/> differentiated policy approach. Being flexible and comprehensive in nature, entrepreneurship policies<lb/> (2001-06) have reduced impediments to entrepreneurial activity and innovation in three major areas: R&amp;D<lb/> and technology, finance, capabilities and access to skilled labour. The innovation-oriented focus of<lb/> entrepreneurship policies was sharpened in 2007 with the creation of the Fund for Technological<lb/> Innovation. Run by the Ministry of Economy and the National Research Council, the new Fund<lb/> complements SME support programmes designed by the SME Fund, Mexico&apos;s main tool for SME and<lb/> entrepreneurship policies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The principal policy instrument employed for impediment reduction has been collective process<lb/> innovation (&apos;institutional road building&apos;). Such collaborative innovations have partly taken the form of<lb/> creating horizontal and vertical network links between entrepreneurial support units (business incubators,<lb/> innovation laboratories, business developments centres and business accelerators). Along with an<lb/> expanded range of support units, &apos;institutional road building&apos; has progressively raised the efficiency of<lb/> central policy impulses imparted by the SME FUND (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.6).<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 2.6. Entrepreneurship policy: stages of firm evolution<lb/> Entrepreneurship<lb/> policy<lb/> Stages of firm evolution<lb/> Pre-birth<lb/> Birth<lb/> Expansion<lb/> Internationalisation<lb/> Support Units and<lb/> Programmes<lb/> Business<lb/> Incubators<lb/> Business<lb/> Development<lb/> Centres<lb/> Business<lb/> Development<lb/> Centres<lb/> Business<lb/> Accelerators<lb/> Investment<lb/> Clubs<lb/> Innovation<lb/> Laboratories<lb/> Training<lb/> Business<lb/> Accelerators<lb/> Training<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></table>

			<p>The &apos;collective efficiency approach&apos; has also been applied to stakeholders of entrepreneurship policy,<lb/> i.e. different levels of government, intermediate organisations (non-banking banks, foundations, business<lb/> associations, international organisations) as well as educational and research institutions. In line with best<lb/> practice, administrative powers have been decentralised, contributing to improved policy co-ordination at<lb/> all levels of government. State and local governments have thus been able to participate more actively in<lb/> the design and execution of novel entrepreneurship policy projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.<lb/> Improved access to new technology, benefits from R&amp;D and networking facilities<lb/></head>

			<p>The innovation-oriented policy approach has facilitated access to new technology by way of<lb/> establishing and expanding networks of enterprise support units, including business incubators, innovation<lb/> laboratories, business accelerators, centres of applied research and technological development. Both the<lb/> rising number of the support units and expanded and deepened linkages among them as well as sharply<lb/> rising numbers of programme beneficiaries testify to a significantly improved climate for innovation<lb/> diffusion. In 2006, the SME Fund spent about 30% of its budget on these programmes.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2004-07, business incubators induced the creation of nearly 5 700 firms (1.5% of Mexico&apos;s firm<lb/> population), two-thirds of which have used intermediate technology. Product and process innovations have<lb/> also been fostered by business accelerators for high-growth SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Improved access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Firms&apos; access to finance has become much easier with the introduction of innovation-oriented policy<lb/> measures. The supply of short-term credit funds from both banks and non-banks has strongly risen with<lb/> innovative guarantee procedures (auction mechanism), a vastly increased number of financial instruments,<lb/> improved information flows between credit institutions and upgraded advice for credit-seeking enterprises<lb/> (National Guarantee Programme and National Financial Extension Programme).<lb/> The default rate of Mexican guarantee programmes is very low by international comparison, mainly<lb/> reflecting reasonable guarantee coverage and a well-balanced distribution of risk between the Ministry of<lb/> Economy, the State Development (NAFIN) and financial institutions. Improved supply conditions have<lb/> allowed interest rates for short-term bank credits to enterprises to fall relative to standard short-term<lb/> interest rates. Reduced cost of finance, apart from stimulating entrepreneurial activity, has also encouraged<lb/> &apos;informal&apos; entrepreneurs to join the formal economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The bulk of increased credit volumes has gone to small and medium-sized enterprises (growth-<lb/>oriented entrepreneurship). By contrast, micro credits, totalling USD 308 million in 2005 or USD 77 per<lb/> each micro enterprise in the formal economy, remained small, especially relative to potential bank credit<lb/> demand of subsistence entrepreneurs. Altogether, the SME Fund used 30% of its resources for easing<lb/> firms&apos; access to finance in 2006.<lb/></p>

			<p>Starting from low levels, the supply of venture capital and longer-term credit funds has also increased<lb/> (Capital for Development Schemes). Reflecting reduced barriers to finance, interest rates for credits to<lb/> enterprises have decreased relative to standard interest rates. Transaction costs have also been reduced by<lb/> the removal of collateral requirements for some categories of credits and by upgraded credit advice.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Improved access to skilled labour and business services<lb/></head>

			<p>Several programmes, absorbing more than 40% of the SME Fund&apos;s resources, have enlarged and<lb/> upgraded the access to skilled labour and business services (Business Development Centres Network<lb/> (BDCs), Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms&apos; Capabilities). Increased supplies of business<lb/> services are evident in the expansion of business development centres (BDCs), the establishment of new<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> high-quality service centres (centres of productive articulation, CAPs) and rising numbers of well-focused<lb/> workshops and interviews.<lb/> Stricter monitoring and network building have improved the quality of BDCs&apos; services. Moreover,<lb/> since 2005 training options have been adapted to potential impacts of different types of innovation. Finally,<lb/> large numbers of subsistence entrepreneurs have benefited from basic training services, triggering wide-<lb/>spread non-R&amp;D innovations and raising production efficiency (PROMODE programme).<lb/></p>

			<head>Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, Mexico&apos;s new innovation-oriented policy effort has been unprecedented in both scale and<lb/> depth. Gauging aggregate policy effects, though, is still difficult. Policy lead times are long, most statistical<lb/> data is inadequate, and appropriate evaluation procedures are not yet in place. Even so, a number of<lb/> encouraging signs have emerged, pointing to a positive impact of new innovation-oriented policies. On the<lb/> input side, the number of entrepreneurs receiving some kind of policy help has surged, rising to an<lb/> estimated 254 000 in 2006 compared with 13 000 in 2000. Two-thirds of enterprises receiving support in<lb/> 2006 were micro firms. For some categories of firms, access to finance has become less difficult. On the<lb/> output side, the average survival time of new firms has lengthened over the past few years, partly reflecting<lb/> the rising weight of incubator-induced firms in the pool of newly created firms. The network of business<lb/> incubators has been considerably expanded.<lb/></p>

			<p>Positive signals notwithstanding, room for still better entrepreneurship policy efforts remains large.<lb/> Sluggish productivity trends, reflecting firms&apos; inefficient production modes, call for strongly increased<lb/> government resources. 49 Much stronger emphasis should be placed on improving firms&apos; access to new<lb/> technology, finance and skilled labour. Continued network building, designing new financial instruments,<lb/> increased supplies of basic advisory and training services as well as better facilities for entrepreneurship<lb/> education are essential for lifting vast numbers of subsistence entrepreneurs out of poverty and<lb/> inefficiency.<lb/> 49<lb/> <ref type="biblio">OECD (2007)</ref>, SMEs in Mexico.<lb/></p>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway is committed to implementing entrepreneurship and SME policies as a tool for speeding up<lb/> the pace of innovation and restructuring the business sector. Entrepreneurship policy is rightly seen as a<lb/> crucial element for spurring the birth and growth of firms in a setting of rapid changes in consumer<lb/> preferences, trade, technology, innovation and access to resources. The link between entrepreneurial policy<lb/> and innovation is, by nature, indirect. Efficient measures of entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation<lb/> and growth, and in doing so, they strengthen innovative activity. Viewed from a wider angle,<lb/> entrepreneurship policy itself may pave the way for &apos;collective process innovations&apos;, augmenting the<lb/> effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on individual innovations.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first part of this chapter highlights the main features of Norway&apos;s enterprise population, identifies<lb/> main drivers of entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The<lb/> second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes in four<lb/> major areas of policy intervention: access to R&amp;D and technology, access to finance, capabilities and<lb/> access to skilled labour, and cultural values. The third part provides an evaluation of entrepreneurship<lb/> policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation<lb/> 1.<lb/> Main characteristics of the enterprise sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway&apos;s business structure is characterised by large numbers of micro firms (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.1),<lb/> representing over 90% of the firm population in 2007. Nearly two thirds of the enterprise stock has no<lb/> employees. In the private non-oil sector, there are only a few large companies.<lb/></p>

In comparison 1 540 larger<lb/> enterprises with more than 100 employees represented about 0.5% of the stock of enterprises in 2004,<lb/> employed about 37% of the total number of employees and represented about 47% of the total turnover<lb/> (Table 3.1).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In industries such as construction, real estate, wholesale and retail, financial services and primary<lb/> industries, SMEs accounted for more than 99% of businesses in 2004, while in other sectors such as<lb/> transportation and communication, hotels and restaurants, the share was slightly lower (98%). In<lb/> manufacturing, 98% of the enterprises were SMEs, with a comparatively strong presence of medium-sized<lb/> firms employing between 10 and 250 persons. In contrast, the share of micro firms is comparatively low<lb/> (Annex 3.1, <ref type="table">Table A</ref>			<figure>.3.1).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Given the importance of its resource-based economy, only 7% of the enterprises in Norway are in the<lb/> manufacturing sector (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<figure>.2). Norway has few high-technology industries outside the petroleum sector.<lb/> The share of low-tech manufacturing production in the total manufacturing output is about 80%, a<lb/> considerably higher figure than almost any OECD country. Low-tech, however, does not entail low<lb/> productivity: the level of productivity is high in general. Norway enjoys a high level of GDP per capita,<lb/> which cannot be only explained by rising oil and gas exports. 51<lb/> 50<lb/> In Norway, SMEs are defined as companies with less than 100 employees. Large firms are defined as<lb/> companies with more than 100 employees.<lb/> 51<lb/> OECD (2007), Economic Surveys Norway (page 125).<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<figure>Source: Statistics Norway.<lb/> The distribution of the firm population by size class is rather homogenous across different counties<lb/> and regional dispersion of GDP per capita is far below the OECD average (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.1).<lb/> Counties situated in the southern part of Norway (Oslo, Akershus, Rogaland, Hordaland) host more<lb/> enterprises than northern counties such as Finnmark, Troms and Nord-Trondelag that are more remote<lb/> from the capital and more sparsely populated. The counties situated in the southern part of Norway are also<lb/> the ones that host most of the large enterprises.<lb/> Rates of firm birth and death are high by international comparison (Figure 3.2). In 2006,<lb/> 51 246 companies were established (16% of the stock of companies) and 41 121 (13% of the enterprise<lb/> stock) were dismantled, while 3 032 enterprises went bankrupt, representing 1% of the company stock. The<lb/> survival rate for self-run enterprises (with no employees) is low relative to the survival rate of other SMEs,<lb/> with only 17% of self-run firms created in 2001 surviving for more than three years.<lb/> The magnitude of start-ups from 2006 partly reflects new legislation on the taxation of dividends.<lb/> Dividends paid by one company to another are exempt from taxation. There are also advantages in owning<lb/> property through companies. The implicit financial incentive has led to stronger firm creation.<lb/> According to the 2005 OECD Survey &quot; Policy Questionnaire on Bankruptcy &quot; 52 possibilities for<lb/> reorganising a company and chances of getting a fresh start in case of financial difficulties appear to be<lb/> lower in Norway than in other OECD countries, where early warning systems for financially distressed<lb/> companies, fast track mechanisms for reorganisation or fast track discharge proceedings for legitimate<lb/> bankruptcies are available.

			<p>Penetration of information and communication technology (ICTs) is high and basic<lb/> telecommunication connections are available at a reasonable price.</p>

			<figure>The number of broadband subscribers<lb/> for instance is amongst the highest in OECD countries although prices are higher than in some<lb/> neighbouring countries (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.3). The total use of wideband/broadband in industry has<lb/> increased by 24% between 2006 and 2007. Besides, mobile telephone charges are low as it is also the case<lb/> in other Nordic countries (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.2). Investment in ICT equipment and software<lb/> nonetheless been lower in Norway than in other OECD countries between 2000 and 2003 (Figure 3.3).<lb/> Perceived barriers to the usage of ICT by enterprises include the shortcomings of the software received, the<lb/> expenses linked to IT as well as the inflexibility of IT suppliers. 54<lb/> 54<lb/> Information from Statistics Norway.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> Figure 3.3.

			<head>b)<lb/> Access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>The banking system seems relatively efficient -interest rates and risk premiums are modest, both<lb/> from a historical perspective and compared to other OECD countries (Annex 3.A, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.A.8). Access to<lb/> bank loans seems adequate, including loans without collateral, an important source of finance to many<lb/> entrepreneurs who lack transferable securities and other assets that can serve as collateral. Overall, access<lb/> to loans without collateral appears to be easier than in many other OECD countries, 56 which may explain<lb/> the declining use of government guarantee schemes in recent years.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Access to capabilities and to skilled labour<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway has been successful in building a high level of human capital. Average years spent in formal<lb/> education for both men and women are among the highest in the OECD and have been so for many<lb/> decades. Norway ranks very high in terms of upper-secondary education and about 40% of the population<lb/> aged 25-34 had at least tertiary education in 2004 (Annex 3.A, <ref type="figure">Figures 3.A.9 and 10</ref>). The number of<lb/> students pursuing scientific and technical courses has, however, fallen, and Norwegian students score less<lb/> than most other advanced OECD countries in the PISA test (Annex 3.A, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.A.11).<lb/></p>

			<head>d)<lb/> Cultural factors<lb/></head>

			<p>Surveys (<ref type="biblio">GEM 2006</ref>) indicate that Norway has a strong entrepreneurial culture, having a high early-<lb/>stage entrepreneurial activity rate for a country with a high GDP per capita income. Over 9% of the adult<lb/> population</p>

			<figure>(18-64 years) was involved in early stage entrepreneurial activities in 2006 (versus 7% in<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> 2004). There are however significant differences by gender. Although the share of female participation in<lb/> early stage entrepreneurial activities has increased from 24% in 2005 to 32% in 2006, it still remains<lb/> relatively low: under 6% of women were involved in early stage entrepreneurial activities in 2006 against<lb/> 12.3% of men.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Entrepreneurship in Norway is highly opportunity-driven and is not based on necessity. According to<lb/> surveys, being more independent is the main motivation for pursuing entrepreneurial activities. Increasing<lb/> income ranks as a lower motivation.<lb/> As in other countries, tax and regulatory requirements influence the choice between becoming an<lb/> employee, or being self-employed. Compared to employees, the self-employed have lower social security<lb/> contributions while being entitled to lower social benefits. However, the self-employed may choose to<lb/> establish a private limited company and employ themselves. By doing this, they have to pay both the<lb/> employers&apos; national insurance contribution and the social security contribution as an employee. In<lb/> exchange, they receive social benefits as an employee.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> 1.<lb/> Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy<lb/></head>

			<p>A Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy was launched in October 2003 (Box 3.1). The plan,<lb/> known as &quot; From Idea to Value &quot; , aims at better co-ordinated and targeted efforts for innovation and<lb/> improved harmonisation of Entrepreneurship and SME policy. The plan is the result of broad co-operation<lb/> between a number of ministries, including the Minister of Local Government and Regional Development,<lb/> the Minister of Education and Research, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Petroleum and Energy<lb/> and the Ministry of Trade and Industry.<lb/> The Plan highlights five main policy areas central to innovation policy with specific objectives and<lb/> measures in each area (general conditions for trade and industry; knowledge and competency; research,<lb/> development and commercialisation; entrepreneurship – starting a new business; and electronic and<lb/> physical infrastructure). While Ministries issue national guidelines, the county administrations are<lb/> responsible for the regional strategies. The plan From Idea to Value builds on previous policy efforts to<lb/> simplify regulation affecting business (Simplifying Norway Action <ref type="biblio">Plan, 2002</ref>) and to facilitate the process<lb/> of establishing and running a business (Bedin Internet service).<lb/></p>

			<p>The Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy provides a framework for SME and<lb/> Entrepreneurship policy. Companies in an early stage and SMEs &quot; with potential and ambitions for growth &quot;<lb/> have been defined as priority areas. The aim for Entrepreneurship policy is to speed up the pace of<lb/> innovation and restructuring of the Norwegian business sector through start-ups. This is notably to be<lb/> achieved through a strengthened Norwegian culture of entrepreneurship with special attention to the<lb/> younger population. The Strategy for Entrepreneurship in <ref type="biblio">Education (2004)</ref>, which aims to integrate<lb/> entrepreneurship in the curriculum, was launched in this context and has been revised in 2006. The revised<lb/> version of the education strategy was presented at the conference &quot; Entrepreneurship education in Europe:<lb/> Fostering entrepreneurial mindsets through education and learning &quot; in Oslo in October 2006.<lb/> For SMEs, network-based innovation and restructuring has been targeted with designated focus areas<lb/> of regional or local nature. The idea is to meet the restructuring needs of local communities or regions<lb/> where key industries and innovation systems are either to be restructured, or developed. Finally, policy has<lb/> aimed at increasing innovation across the Norwegian business sector and at increasing the number of<lb/> innovation projects based on market demand.<lb/></p>

			<head>Main actors<lb/></head>

			<p>Entrepreneurship and SME policies are designed, implemented and monitored by three Ministries: the<lb/> Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Trade</ref> and Industry, the Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of Local<lb/> Government and Regional development (Figure 3.6). Three major agencies support the policies:<lb/> Innovation Norway, the Industrial Development Corporation (SIVA) and the Research Council of Norway<lb/> (RCN). Various supporting sub-units carry through business development and innovation at regional and<lb/> national levels.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> Figure 3.6. Major stakeholders of Entrepreneurship and SME policy<lb/> Ministry of<lb/> Education and<lb/> Research<lb/> Ministry of Trade<lb/> and Industry<lb/> Ministry of Local<lb/> Government and<lb/> Regional<lb/> Development<lb/> RCN<lb/> Innovation<lb/> Norway<lb/> SIVA<lb/> Owns<lb/> Has<lb/> responsbility and<lb/> f unds<lb/> Municipalities<lb/> Co-<lb/>owns<lb/> Business<lb/> gardens<lb/> Incubators<lb/> Funds<lb/> Fund<lb/> Innovation Norway, 58 created in 2004 to implement the innovation strategy, offers an improved and<lb/> better co-ordinated access to the full spectrum of public support for business and innovation. Innovation<lb/> Norway is funded primarily by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Local Government<lb/> and Regional development. Its main objective is to promote business development and increase the<lb/> competitiveness of individual companies and groups of companies throughout the country; to release the<lb/> commercial opportunities of the districts and regions. To achieve this, Innovation Norway delivers services<lb/> ranging from financing, linking companies to know-how and helping to create networks. It also assists in<lb/> restructuring and revitalising specific industries and regions. Services provided include for example the<lb/> provision of seed capital to start-up firms together with the private sector. Innovation Norway also<lb/> promotes R&amp;D contracts (IFU) where as two parties (normally an SME supplier and a customer) commit<lb/> to developing an innovative product, service or process which is new to the market. Innovation Norway&apos;s<lb/> budget for 2008 is NOK 2 500 million and NOK 1 840 million (for the loan and guarantee framework).<lb/> SIVA, a state enterprise owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has been in charge of<lb/> improving the national infrastructure for innovative business activities. This has been achieved through<lb/> increased networking, the promotion of strong regional and local industrial clusters and an increased range<lb/> of business services. As a result, a large number of business development centers, business gardens and<lb/> incubators have been set up in the different Norwegian counties in recent years and are co-owned by<lb/> SIVA. The annual budget for SIVA in 2007 was NOK 100 million.<lb/> The Research Council of Norway (RCN) promotes and supports basic and applied research as well as<lb/> research-driven innovation in all sectors and branches. RCN is a strategic body which identifies areas<lb/> where efforts are needed, allocates research funds and evaluates results. It acts as a contact point, network-<lb/>builder and administrator of programmes where private industry, R&amp;D institutions and universities are<lb/> involved. The Ministry of Education and Research has administrative responsibility for RCN and is also its<lb/> largest contributor. The Ministry of Trade and Industry provides about 20% of the budget to finance<lb/> projects relating to industrial R&amp;D projects. RCN&apos;s annual budget for 2007 was more than NOK 5 billion.<lb/> 58<lb/> Innovation Norway is a merger of four previously separate institutions: the Norwegian Industrial and<lb/> Regional Development Fund (SDN), the Norwegian Trade Council (NTC), the government&apos;s Advisory<lb/> Board for Investors and the Norwegian Tourist Board.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> 88<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.<lb/> Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovation activities<lb/> a)<lb/> Access to technology, R&amp;D benefits and networking activities<lb/></head>

			<p>Supporting private R&amp;D<lb/> A tax credit scheme (Skattefunn) was introduced in 2002 to encourage private R&amp;D and innovation.<lb/> Since its inception it has received strong support from the business sector. Approval of projects is given by<lb/> the RCN according to R&amp;D content. The qualifying projects must generate new knowledge in a broad<lb/> sense that favours the development of new products, processes or services. There are no regional or<lb/> sectoral constraints. Skattefunn provides a 20% deduction of R&amp;D costs, up to NOK 4 million, per firm<lb/> and per year for internal projects and an additional NOK 4 million for R&amp;D purchases from universities<lb/> and institutes. Large companies benefit from an 18% deduction 59 with ceilings being the same. Enterprises<lb/> that have no or insufficient taxable income are paid the equivalent as a grant. The scheme is neutral<lb/> between qualifying projects, regions, sectors and the tax position of qualifying firms. It nonetheless lowers<lb/> the marginal cost of R&amp;D in small enterprises or low R&amp;D spenders more than in larger ones.<lb/></p>

			<head>Facilitating business and networking activities<lb/></head>

			<p>The system set up to promote business and networking activities is comprehensive and consists of<lb/> Business gardens, research parks and incubators. SIVA has a key role in promoting strong regional and<lb/> local industrial clusters. It builds networks between regional, national and international R&amp;D<lb/> environments. These are developed through a functional infrastructure of investments and networking.<lb/> Investments are made in venture companies, innovative companies, incubators and network companies.<lb/></p>

			<p>As the Norwegian government&apos;s policy goal is to unleash innovation capability and increase wealth<lb/> creation in all parts of the country, SIVA&apos;s strategy deploys a variety of instruments in order to address the<lb/> needs of different parts of the country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Business gardens</head>

			<figure>(or Business development centers) were established in 1998 as a support scheme<lb/> under the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. This scheme is one of the concepts<lb/> designed for the most rural areas of Norway: 45 business gardens have been developed across Norway to<lb/> enhance entrepreneurship and new business development in remote areas without colleges or universities.<lb/> Business gardens locate knowledge-based companies in innovative networks to stimulate innovation in<lb/> SMEs and the development of new enterprises. They have a multi-stakeholder approach which makes them<lb/> networking hubs: they function as a partner for companies, investors and R&amp;D environments.<lb/> Incubators aim to provide entrepreneurs with resources in the form of expertise, business experience,<lb/> consultants and capital -mainly from Universities and R&amp;D institutions. nineteen incubators have been<lb/> established across Norway. Depending on performances, each incubator receives approximately<lb/> NOK 3.5 million over 5 years. The scheme is financed by the Ministry of Local Government and Regional<lb/> Development. The new incubator programme is oriented towards regional innovative environments; SIVA<lb/> therefore focuses on developing regional expertise in business incubation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Industry incubators are types of incubators that are tied to heavy industry companies or to a<lb/> unification of industry companies (instead of being bound to a research environment). The main function<lb/> of the incubator is to identify business ideas and to find entrepreneurs ready to start new businesses. The<lb/> industry companies are central to the success of the incubator, as they would provide premises, competence<lb/> 59<lb/></p>

			<p>This is due to EU/EEA state aid rule.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> and leadership. These companies also engage on purchasing products or services of the newly established<lb/> businesses over some time.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transfering new technology and commercialising R&amp;D<lb/></head>

			<p>Research parks are closely and formally connected to leading universities and colleges and contribute<lb/> to increased regional value creation by applying research results in complicated products, processes and<lb/> services. They act as innovative clusters where businesses, R&amp;D and public programmes together allow<lb/> innovation and the commercialisation of innovation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Technology Transfer Offices</head>

			<p>(TTO) were set up in Norwegian universities as from 1993 to facilitate<lb/> commercialisation of research and development by assisting academics who are unfamiliar with<lb/> procedures involved to exploit their finding financially. They are staffed by 10-15 persons, and offer<lb/> scientists and students evaluation of their business ideas, patenting, licensing and advisory services on how<lb/> to start a company and business development. From 2003, all universities and colleges in Norway were<lb/> instructed to contribute to the commercialisation of new ideas from the institutions.<lb/> The FORNY programme was established in 2000 to enhance the commercialisation of research with<lb/> considerable market potential. It is a joint programme between the RCN and Innovation Norway which<lb/> funds activities making researchers and research institutions focus on the commercial potential of research<lb/> results, the process of establishing a new company or licence, the cost of verification of technology and<lb/> scholarships for researchers. FORNY works through institutions that employ the researchers, through the<lb/> TTO of these institutions, a selection of their co-operating innovation companies and science parks. The<lb/> FORNY funding can cover up to 50% of the costs related to these activities. In 2006, FORNY had a budget<lb/> of NOK 120 million.<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> Better access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Given conditions prevailing in the Norwegian financial sector (see above), recent government<lb/> programmes have justifiably focused on improving access to equity capital for enterprises by strengthening<lb/> the equity market and by improving communication between enterprises and investors. A special focus has<lb/> been to give enterprises sufficient access to capital in early stages, especially for projects involving new<lb/> technology and knowledge-based businesses. Risk loans have been used for innovation and development<lb/> project funding, as well as for investments in fixed assets. Some loan guarantee and grant schemes remain<lb/> (see Box 3.2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3.2 Loan guarantees and grant schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>Guarantees have been available to reduce the risk factor in connection with loans and operating credits from<lb/> other financing institutions. Grants have financed development projects such as product or process development or<lb/> market development. Grant schemes have for example been given to stimulate close co-operation in product<lb/> development between a costumer company and different suppliers.<lb/> The Innovation Norway guarantee scheme targets SMEs with up to 100 employees. The guarantee covers losses<lb/> up to 50% on loans granted by private banks. The loans are normally extended for working capital, the banks<lb/> establishing collaterals in borrowers&apos; assets. These guarantees are seldom used<lb/> 60 because of stringent conditionality:<lb/> private banks must sell all assets serving as collateral for a guaranteed loan before the guarantees will be in effect.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Most micro loans are available through the Cultura Bank which has different loan schemes, offering a guarantee<lb/> scheme in co-operation with the European Investment Fund (EIF). Start-up loans are subject to an upper limit of<lb/> EUR 25 000. The EIF covers 75% of the loss guarantee. Cultura Bank is co-operating with Network Credit BA which<lb/> helps entrepreneurs establish network groups, which makes them eligible for receiving micro loans through the &quot; Micro<lb/> Invest &quot; foundation.<lb/> 61 The foundation has become a guarantee institution backing loans awarded by the Cultura Bank.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The private equity market in Norway is small and fragmented by European standards and it appears as<lb/> one of the weakest capital offerings available to SMEs. To address this market gap in funding for new<lb/> firms, notably in the early phases, the Norwegian government instaured mechanisms to provide risk capital<lb/> investors with public co-investment schemes (the Seed capital scheme and Argentum). The government<lb/> also recently set up a public investment fund to allow a broader flow of financial funds available to<lb/> enterprises with high growth potential.<lb/> • The Seed capital scheme is a public/private partnership administered by Innovation Norway, on<lb/> behalf of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Each part contributes half of the capital stock in the<lb/> seed capital funds; there is an equal share between subordinated loans from the government and a<lb/> mixture of equity and subordinated loans from investors. The funds which are privately owned<lb/> invest equity capital in start-up businesses with high value added potential. The aim of the seed<lb/> capital scheme is to increase the share of high growth companies. These funds are supposed to<lb/> have a long-term perspective on the investments and supply enterprises with competence.<lb/> Government provides risk-relief to private investors through a loss-fund. The loss-fund for each<lb/> fund accumulates to NOK 341.75 million. Recent amendments to the seed capital schemes have<lb/> been introduced to make follow-on investments easier for private investors as previous<lb/> restrictions on follow-on investments had been met with investor resistance.<lb/> • Argentum is a government-owned fund-of-fund investor in the private equity sector that was<lb/> established in 2001 and is governed by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. It has<lb/> been set up to develop a fragmented private equity sector mainly composed of the State and<lb/> wealthy private individuals. Through its investments, Argentum aims to facilitate access to<lb/> international venture capital and to develop an internationally competitive private equity<lb/> environment in Norway. It invests through either established or new fund management structures.<lb/></p>

			<table>Argentum focuses on attracting fund managers to Norway based on existing strong industries.<lb/> Only a small portion of capital is allocated to purely international funds. All investments have<lb/> private majority ownership. The government provided NOK 2.65 billion to the fund.<lb/> 60<lb/> Six guarantees during 2006 and 2007 of NOK 6 million.<lb/> 61<lb/> Established in 2003, this foundation is funded by Network Credit BA and Cultura Bank.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> • The new Governmental investment fund (created in 2007) is a national investment fund fostering<lb/> new established companies with high growth potential. It aims to facilitate commercialisation of<lb/> globally oriented and competitive projects at an early stage by offering long-term risk capital.<lb/> Five priority areas have been identified: environment, tourism, energy, coastal and maritime<lb/> industries.<lb/></table>

			<p>To increase transparency in the venture capital market and to facilitate the release of private venture<lb/> capital, Innovation Norway has supported private initiatives to increase the flow of information between<lb/> businesses and risk capital investors (Connect Norway, Seed Forum Norway, Venturelab). It has notably<lb/> provided financial support to the establishment of Business Angel Networks. No organised network with<lb/> adequate mechanisms for connecting investors and entrepreneurs existed in the past.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Better access to entrepreneurial education and training<lb/> Entrepreneurship Education<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2004 the government launched a national Strategy for Entrepreneurship in Education. The<lb/> government put forward several new and concrete initiatives designed to promote education and training<lb/> for entrepreneurship. The purpose of the strategy is to profile entrepreneurship as an educational objective<lb/> and training strategy. Entrepreneurship in education is perceived as an important tool in fostering a culture<lb/> for entrepreneurship and positive attitudes towards entrepreneurs. Teaching entrepreneurship is expected<lb/> not only to strengthen confidence in the ability to succeed as an entrepreneur, but also to improve the<lb/> ability to assess the profitability of different projects.<lb/> The strategy addresses the entire educational system from primary school to college and university<lb/> and also includes teacher training. 62 It was developed in co-operation by three ministries: the Ministry of<lb/> Education and Research, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Regional Development<lb/> and Local Government. An inter-ministerial reference group allows collaboration between the different<lb/> ministries and the follow-up of the strategy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The strategy was revised in 2006, and an important part focuses on the support to organisations and<lb/> other stakeholders that promote entrepreneurship education. It motivates educational institutions,<lb/> municipalities and country municipalities to establish training in entrepreneurship in close collaboration<lb/> with trade and industry and other stakeholders of the local environment (e.g. local business and the social<lb/> sector). Training in entrepreneurship requires close collaboration between schools, the local business and<lb/> the social sector.<lb/> At primary, lower and upper secondary level, entrepreneurship education is emphasised differently in<lb/> schools and its extent in different counties varies significantly. The Government supports &quot; Junior<lb/> Achievement -Young Enterprise Norway &quot; (JA-YE) in the context of its strategic plan. JA-YE, established<lb/> in 1997, is the largest private supplier of entrepreneurship training in Norway and supports government<lb/> efforts to increase the supply and quality of entrepreneurial education. It has a national administration and<lb/> local branches in all counties. It provides training and teacher training at all stages of education.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In 2005/2006, 12 000 pupils took part in 1 900 enterprises in 300 upper secondary schools. The Ministry of<lb/> Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development and the Ministry of<lb/> Education and Research allocated NOK 16.8 million to the organisation in 2007. 63<lb/> 62<lb/> In 2005/2006 about 20 teacher training institutions provided post and further education programmes.<lb/> 63<lb/> Junior Achievement -Young Enterprise Norway is also being financed by several county municipalities.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<p>Regarding Higher Education, a number of Universities and colleges provide both compulsory and<lb/> elective subjects of study within entrepreneurship, especially linked to education in economics and<lb/> technology. 64 Programmes targeted to some specific professions do not seem sufficiently developed,<lb/> however. Courses also include practice and are done in collaboration/partnerships with local business. A<lb/> wide range of initiatives has promoted entrepreneurship at Higher Education level (Box 3.3). The<lb/> Norwegian Research Council is currently working on a scheme allowing doctoral dissertations to be<lb/> written in collaborative projects between universities and the business sector.<lb/> Adults may receive education and training. The concept of &quot; Introductory Enterprises &quot; has been<lb/> launched where immigrants can develop their abilities in entrepreneurship under expert guidance. It has<lb/> been moduled on the JA-YE concept. Currently six pilot projects have been launched in six different<lb/> municipalities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3.3 Initiatives promoting entrepreneurship in Higher Education<lb/></head>

			<p>• Europrise: practical entrepreneurship training developed by EINET (European network for education in<lb/> entrepreneurship) which includes practical experience of founding an existing enterprise. It is provided at a<lb/> number of colleges in collaboration with Innovation Norway, county municipalities and regional trade and<lb/> industry.<lb/> • JA-YE Norway provides the concept of &quot; Student Enterprise &quot; to universities and colleges and can be run for<lb/> 12 months.<lb/> • &quot; Innovation Net &quot; : a network established by colleges which includes providing courses for employees and<lb/> students in various subjects, notably entrepreneurship.<lb/> • StartNorge: is an organisation for students who are interested in enterprise founding and innovation. It is<lb/> meant to be a power center for students and has 10 local associations.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Business-oriented Educational Programme: established by the Norwegian Research Council. The<lb/> programme intends to develop interplay between SMEs and state colleges to increase innovation and<lb/> regional development capacity.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The majority of Norway&apos;s counties have local and regional development programmes that include the<lb/> promotion of entrepreneurship. Regional and local authorities support and fund different initiatives about<lb/> 10% of the funds for regional development were used for paving the way for entrepreneurship and the<lb/> establishment of new enterprises in 2006. Funds have been allocated to partnerships between stakeholders<lb/> such as the business sector, providers of teaching, educational institutions, municipalities and other<lb/> organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway is known for its commitment to entrepreneurship policy as a major tool for spurring the birth<lb/> and growth of firms. Given continual changes in consumer preferences, trade, technology, innovation and<lb/> access to resources, entrepreneurship is rightly seen as a crucial element shaping an economy&apos;s adaptive<lb/> and innovative capacity. A high per capita income country with relatively well functioning financial<lb/> 64<lb/> <ref type="biblio">The</ref> Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Oslo provides a number of courses in<lb/> Entrepreneurship and innovation, for example: a Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship; a<lb/> programme &quot; From Idea to Enterprise &quot; ; a HUMSAM-Course on how to establish a business.<lb/> markets, Norway has placed entrepreneurial education at the centre of its entrepreneurship policy, which<lb/> itself is an integrated part of the 2003 Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Helped by favourable macro-economic conditions and low barriers to entrepreneurship, this policy<lb/> approach has contributed to a rising entrepreneurial activity. This is evident in recent strong firm creation<lb/> and high numbers of pupils and students taking courses in entrepreneurial education. Surveys show<lb/> Norway being one of the most entrepreneurial countries in Europe, second only to <ref type="biblio">Iceland in 2006.<lb/></ref> On firms level, entrepreneurial quality is partly reflected in the efficiency of manufacturing micro<lb/> firms employing less than 10 persons. Compared to most other countries, Norway&apos;s micro firms exhibited<lb/> high output shares relative to their respective firm population shares in 2001-2002 (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.3). Micro firms<lb/> represented 61% of manufacturing firms in 2002, the lowest OECD share after Ireland, but produced more<lb/> than 6% of manufacturing output, one of the highest output shares (Annex 3.A, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.A.1). The implicit<lb/> efficiency ratio of 0.10 (output share divided by firm population share) was comparatively high.

			<p>The economy-wide strength of micro firms is also manifest in high survival rates. Nearly 99% of<lb/> those firms which were established in 2001 and survived until 2004, employed fewer than 20 employees.<lb/> Particularly high survival rates were noted for small and micro-enterprises in construction, wholesale retail<lb/> trade, repair, hotels, restaurants, financial intermediation, real estate, education, health and social work.<lb/> New entrepreneurship policy initiatives taken over the past three years have maintained the<lb/> momentum of spurring entrepreneurial and innovative activities. Highlights of these policy efforts have<lb/> been increased networking and financing opportunities through SIVA, RCN and Innovation Norway.<lb/></p>

			<head>Stronger entrepreneurial activity through enlarged education opportunities<lb/></head>

			<p>Gauging direct effects of new policy initiatives is always difficult, policy lead times being long and<lb/> varying with policy categories. Even so, it is striking to note that the percentage of the population of<lb/> working age engaged in early-stage-entrepreneurial-activities (</p>

			<figure>ESEA) increased strongly in 2005 and 2006<lb/> after falling during the previous three years. The observed rise in ESEA was particularly strong for women,<lb/> whose share in ESEA increased to 32% in 2006 from 25% a year earlier.<lb/> Stronger ESEA trends also testify to the work of the Junior-Achievement-Young Enterprise (JA-YE)<lb/> Norway, an organisation which assists government efforts to raise the supply of entrepreneurial education<lb/> opportunities. According to a study made by the North Trondelag Research Institute in 2005, participants<lb/> of the JA-YE&apos;s Company Programme display a much stronger propensity to start a business (16.6%) than<lb/> the population in general (7.5%).<lb/> Improved educational opportunities along with new tax provisions, 65 grants for start-ups and incubator<lb/> use have contributed to the recent acceleration of firm creation, start-ups rising from 43 000 in 2004 to<lb/> 51 000 in 2006, an increase of 7 000 firms. This compares with a rise of 3 000 newly created firms in<lb/> 2001-2003. Increases in recent start-ups were particularly strong in financial intermediation, construction,<lb/> transport, storage and communication, real estate and business services, social and personal services.<lb/> Buoyant business start-ups also reflected a simplified regulatory setting, a consequence of the Simplifying<lb/> Norway Action Plan (2002-2003).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Stronger innovative activity through networks and better incentives<lb/></head>

			<p>In the domain of innovative activity, recent data point to similar, positive developments. After falling<lb/> in the early years of the new millennium, the number</p>

			<figure>of both patent applications and patents granted<lb/> increased strongly between 2004 and 2006. Coincident recoveries are also noted for the number of<lb/> applications and awards for trademarks and design. Private R&amp;D spending, habitually low by international<lb/> comparison, appears to have picked up.<lb/> In varying degrees, these hopeful trends have been associated with several new innovation-oriented<lb/> policy measures (see Box 3.1), including the Norwegian Centres of Excellence Scheme (2002) funded by<lb/> the Norwegian Fund for Innovation and Research, Technology Transfer Offices at Norwegian Universities<lb/> (2003), stronger rights for employees making inventions (2002), the tax credit scheme for R&amp;D<lb/> expenditure (Skattefunn) (2002), the Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy (From Idea to value)<lb/> (2003), units commercialising public R&amp;D (FORNY programme, <ref type="biblio">2000</ref>) and Innovation Norway, a key<lb/> institution emerging from the merger of four innovation-fostering institutions (2004). Nevertheless, there is<lb/> room for more strongly exploiting geographical proximity as a means to group ISMEs and venture capital<lb/> suppliers around universities and other research facilities (creation of technological &apos;hotbeds&apos;).<lb/></p>

			<p>Offering better access to the full range of public support facilities, Innovation Norway has<lb/> strengthened entrepreneurs&apos; innovative activities.</p>

			<head>Entrepreneurial groups sponsored by Innovation Norway<lb/> 65<lb/></head>

			<p>There are elements in the tax system which have contributed to an increase in the number of start-ups in<lb/> recent years. Dividends exceeding the normal rate of return are not taxed if they are given to another<lb/> company. Dividends from companies to private persons, however, are taxed. In addition, the tax system<lb/> provides incentives for persons to own property through companies.<lb/> have integrated entrepreneurs into a network of &apos;peer entrepreneurs&apos; offering social support as well as<lb/> professional advice. In addition, activities performed by the SIVA have increased the range and quality of<lb/> business support services. This has taken the form of larger numbers of business development centres<lb/> (business development gardens) and business incubators. As a result, the networking infrastructure for<lb/> industrial start-ups has improved.<lb/></p>

			<head>Progress in improving access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Signs suggesting easier access to finance are mixed. On the one hand, falling interest rates and risk<lb/> premiums along with rising supplies of venture capital indicate low barriers to entrepreneurship finance.<lb/> Yet recent surveys show entrepreneurs still citing lack of capital as the main obstacle for entrepreneurial<lb/> activities. This may in part be an issue related to problems with business plans, or to the scalability of<lb/> business ideas. Some potential investors indicate that there is not a lack of capital, but a lack of good ideas.<lb/> At any rate, spreading best financial practices has become urgent in the light of the rising capital demand<lb/> linked to stronger ESEA rates. This calls for a fluid financing continuum at all stages 66 of formal and<lb/> informal finance before the entry into regulated capital markets.<lb/> Access to equity capital may have become easier with the national and regional seed capital schemes.<lb/> A similar effect may have resulted from Argentum, the government-owned fund-of-fund investor in the<lb/> private equity market, which has released larger amounts of funds to establish an internationally<lb/> competitive market for private equity. Recent data on larger supplies of venture capital rising from low<lb/> levels validate these policy initiatives. Even so, the average amount invested by business angels has<lb/> remained low by international comparison and the amount of seed capital remains inadequate.<lb/> According to the recent OECD Economic Survey of Norway, the small amount of seed capital<lb/> available for start-ups possibly reflects in part the restrictions on the class of assets that can be invested in<lb/> by insurance companies and pension funds. The Survey recommends that these restrictions be relaxed. The<lb/> Survey also argues that the borrowing conditionality for obtaining seed capital from Innovation Norway is<lb/> too restrictive and that it could be lightened.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, given the relative efficiency of the Norwegian banking system and the plentiful<lb/> availability of bank loans (including without collateral), it may not be justified to maintain the existing<lb/> myriad of guarantee schemes. These should be phased out, as the corresponding government funds could<lb/> be more productively used to further increase the availability of risk capital to entrepreneurs, including by<lb/> expanding the network of business angels. In this context, the existing schemes that mix guarantees and co-<lb/>investment could also be simplified and re-focused.<lb/></p>

			<head>Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>While early signs of recent entrepreneurial policy action are encouraging, the need for a medium-<lb/>term, balanced strategy for entrepreneurship and SME policy remains strong. At the level of stakeholders,<lb/> policy co-ordination does not seem to be a serious problem, but a certain streamlining of responsibilities<lb/> (simplification) may be warranted to avoid duplication. This may require a systematic evaluation of policy<lb/> programmes, which goes beyond the scope of this chapter.<lb/> As far as co-ordination is concerned, special attention should be given to collective process innovation<lb/> taking the form of improved vertical and horizontal networking among business support services, research<lb/> institutions, universities and the business community, to overcome structural under-spending in private<lb/> R&amp;D.<lb/> 66<lb/> <ref type="biblio">OECD (2006)</ref>, The SME Financing Gap.<lb/></p>

			<p>Interest in entrepreneurship can be kindled further by better targeting entrepreneurial education at<lb/> university level. Moreover, as the number of social assistance beneficiaries is relatively high for a low-<lb/>unemployment country, initiatives and courses in entrepreneurship in adult education need to better target<lb/> these beneficiaries with the goal of enlarging the pool of potential entrepreneurs. In this context,<lb/> entrepreneurship education programmes could be better integrated with existing active labour market<lb/> policies (vocational, counseling and other training programmes).<lb/> Success in the educational domain will inevitably result in stronger demand for early-stage risk<lb/> capital. Similar effects will flow from &apos;technological hotbeds&apos; exploiting advantages of geographical<lb/> proximity for research, investment and finance. New and better networking activity among suppliers of<lb/> risk capital (investors&apos; clubs, business angels network, etc.) will help increase access to finance. Taken<lb/> together, the proposed policy measures will eventually equip Norway with an entrepreneurial infrastructure<lb/> that will increase its capacity to meet future challenges.<lb/></p>

			<p>TURKEY<lb/></p>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Turkey&apos;s output increased by one half in the 2002-07 period, representing the strongest pace of<lb/> growth among OECD countries. Catching-up gains notwithstanding, Turkey&apos;s GDP per capita is still<lb/> comparatively low (around 30% of the Euro zone). The root of continued underperformance is low overall<lb/> productivity, reflecting dismal efficiency levels in the sector of small and micro firms. In contrast, large<lb/> and medium-sized firms, benefiting from international partnerships and competition, are highly efficient.<lb/> This points to a highly skewed distribution of productivity performance across business categories.<lb/> In this setting, the creation and enlargement of firms is increasingly seen as a major potential agent<lb/> driving innovation and productivity enhancement. Over the past few years, entrepreneurship policies have<lb/> been correspondingly adapted to strengthen entrepreneurial activities including at the pre-start, start-up and<lb/> post start-up phase of business life.<lb/></p>

			<p>The link between entrepreneurship policy and innovation is, by nature, indirect. Efficient measures of<lb/> entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation and growth, and in doing so they invigorate innovative<lb/> activity. Policy lead times though, vary with the type of entrepreneurship policy. Introducing<lb/> entrepreneurship education in schools and universities is bound to affect innovation trends only in the long<lb/> run. The same is true of easing cultural biases against entrepreneurial activities. In contrast, more<lb/> immediate effects may spring from dismantling barriers to finance as well as setting up well-focused<lb/> training courses for both subsistence entrepreneurs and business counsellors (teachers&apos; training<lb/> programmes). Viewed from a wider angle, entrepreneurship policy itself may constitute an &apos;innovation&apos;,<lb/> augmenting the effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on individual innovations.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first part of this chapter highlights salient features of Turkey&apos;s firm population, identifies main<lb/> impediments to entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The<lb/> second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes in four<lb/> major areas of policy intervention: access to R&amp;D and new technology, access to finance, capabilities and<lb/> access to skilled labour and cultural values. The third and final part provides an evaluation of<lb/> entrepreneurship and SME policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation<lb/> 1.<lb/> Main features of the enterprise sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Turkey&apos;s enterprise sector is marked by two major asymmetries. Small and medium-sized firms<lb/> (SMEs) constitute the near-totality of all firms (99.6% in 2002) displaying one of the highest degrees of<lb/> predominance among OECD countries. While SMEs represent three-quarters of total employment in 2002<lb/> (77%), they account for only one-quarter of total output (27%). Only about one-third of Turkey&apos;s SMEs in<lb/> export. In contrast, a tiny number of large enterprises (employing more than 250 persons) generate nearly<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> three-quarter of value added (73%) with a work force equal to one-quarter of total employment (23%)<lb/> (</p>

			<table>Table 4.1). 67<lb/> Table 4.1 Output and employment shares 2002<lb/> (in %)<lb/> Output share<lb/> Employment share<lb/> Large enterprises (&gt;250 employees)<lb/> 73<lb/> 23<lb/> SMEs (excluding micro firms)<lb/> 19<lb/> 43<lb/> Micro firms (&lt;10 employees)<lb/> 8<lb/> 34<lb/> Source: Turkstat.<lb/></table>

			<p>The second asymmetry concerns the SME sector itself. As is normal for a country with a large<lb/> agricultural sector and a correspondingly low per capita income, micro firms (with less than 10 persons)<lb/> constitute 96% of SMEs (2002). Making up 34% of total employment, micro firms, produce no more than<lb/> 8% of overall output. In contrast, SMEs (excluding micro firms) representing less than 5% of all<lb/> enterprises produce around 19% of overall value added, while absorbing 43% of total employment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In manufacturing, SMEs are similarly predominant, around 246 000 micro firms coexisting with only<lb/> 1 100 large enterprises (with more than 250 persons) and 25 600 SMEs (employing more than 9 persons<lb/> and less than 250 persons) in 2002 (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>			<figure>.2). Turkey&apos;s proportion of micro firms in manufacturing (90%)<lb/> is among the highest in the OECD area, far exceeding shares recorded by high-income countries such as<lb/> the United States, Germany and Norway (around 60%). The average size of SMEs in manufacturing is<lb/> small (4.8 persons in 2003) and even smaller for micro firms (3.1 persons). Overall, Turkey&apos;s firm<lb/> population (excluding rural enterprises and individual farmers) totalled 2 million in 2004, service and<lb/> manufacturing enterprises accounting, respectively, for 86% and 14% of the firm population.<lb/> 67<lb/> TURKSTAT data put the average age of manufacturing and service enterprises at nearly 9 years in 2002.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<table>Table 4.2 Output and employment shares in manufacturing 2002<lb/> Number of firms<lb/> Output share<lb/> Employment share<lb/> Large firms (&gt;250<lb/> employees)<lb/> 1 083<lb/> 66<lb/> 31<lb/> SMEs (excluding micro<lb/> firms)<lb/> 25 610<lb/> 28<lb/> 42<lb/> Micro firms employees<lb/> (&lt;10 employees)<lb/> 245 789<lb/> 6<lb/> 27<lb/> Note: Large firms are defined here as firms with over 150 employees; Micro firms as firms between 0 and 9 employees.<lb/> Source: Turkstat (2002).<lb/></table>

			<p>The economy-wide and manufacturing data shown above reveal huge gaps in productivity levels<lb/> across three major categories of firms:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Large firms (&gt; 250 employees) are highly efficient by both international and Turkish standards.<lb/> Their entrepreneurial presence, though, is weak. There are only 910 large enterprises in<lb/> manufacturing compared with 3 000 large manufacturing firms in Mexico, another low per capita<lb/> income country. Large firms in the formal sector have a robust physical and human capital base.<lb/> Being well connected to international markets and partners, they have been able to achieve strong<lb/> productivity gains over the past five years.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Medium-sized firms (MSEs) (50-249 employees) excluding small firms and micro firms,</head>

			<p>are less<lb/> productive than large firms. But helped by vibrant entrepreneurship, MSEs have been the most<lb/> dynamic component of Turkey&apos;s business sector over the past decade. MSEs operate in all<lb/> manufacturing and service activities, and particularly in tradable sectors such as textiles, clothing,<lb/> metal working, machinery, food and furniture. They have grown in the traditional industrial<lb/> centres of Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa and, more typically, in a range of Anatolian towns (Denizli,<lb/> Gaziantep, Kayseri and Eskisehir). Organised industrial zones established in these towns have<lb/> provided the infrastructure for exceptionally fast output growth. Because of their ability to<lb/> nurture a large population of high-growth firms, these towns have been dubbed &apos;Anatolian<lb/> Tigers&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Micro firms (&lt; 10 employees), which are dominant in agriculture and numerous in clothing,<lb/> metal working, food industries, retail trade, construction and transportation, are grossly<lb/> inefficient by both national and international standards. Their biggest handicap is weak human<lb/> capital stock and a deficient equity base. Many micro firms have no other regular employees than<lb/> their family members. In France, Italy and Portugal, micro firms&apos; output share is nearly twice as<lb/> high as in Turkey, while their weight in the firm population is much lower.<lb/></p>

Share of formal and informal sector workers in the working age population with given educational background.<lb/> Source: OECD Economic Surveys, Turkey, 2006 based on data from TURKSTAT, SPO.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<p>The productivity gap is also large between formal and informal enterprises. Half-formal firms have<lb/> achieved a significant catching-up in the past decade and are now at an intermediate level of efficiency<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.1). A large part of Turkey&apos;s working force is active in the informal economy which produces<lb/> roughly one half of formal SMEs&apos; value added. The scale of informal activities is negatively correlated<lb/> with the size of firms as well with the level of educational attainment.<lb/> No less than three-quarters of micro firms have regular recourse to informal activities as against one<lb/> tenth of medium-sized firms. 68 Agriculture, where micro firms abound, is almost entirely informal,<lb/> employing one third of the work force at depressed levels of productivity. Many high-growth MSEs are<lb/> partly engaged in informal activities, using contracting-out procedures to avoid the full burden of formality<lb/> (semi-informal firms). In contrast, large firms appear to be firmly anchored in formal activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The three tiers of efficiency levels thus point to major imbalances of entrepreneurial activity. There is<lb/> an &apos;oversupply&apos; of ineffective subsistence entrepreneurship and a correspondingly strong lack of efficient<lb/> growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity. This dichotomy shows up in both a high self-employment rate<lb/> and a large regional dispersion of GDP per capita. Both indicators top levels shown by other OECD<lb/> countries in 2001 (<ref type="figure">Figures</ref> 4.2 and 4.3). Reflecting population distribution, more than 80% of SMEs are<lb/> located in four major regions (Marmara, Aegean Sea, Central Anatolia and the Mediterranean coastal<lb/> region), the remaining SMEs being present in the Black Sea region and in South-Eastern and Eastern<lb/> Anatolia.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Labour market conditions are marked by low activity rates (around 75% for men, 28% for women and<lb/> a combined average of 52% in 2002). More than half of dependently employed women (5.5 million<lb/> women) are unpaid family workers, most of them working in agriculture. Female entrepreneurial activity is<lb/> extremely low (3-4% of the female labour force), mainly reflecting lack of education, work experience and<lb/> adverse cultural biases.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Factors driving firm creation and expansion<lb/></head>

			<p>A set of chronic impediments hamper firm creation, including lack of new technology, R&amp;D benefits,<lb/> finance, skilled labour and business services. These constraints are particularly severe for small and micro<lb/> firms, weighed down by an under endowment of both tangible and intangible capital. The main<lb/> impediment faced by large firms and MSEs is a heavy regulatory framework in the formal economy, which<lb/> is way out of line with international standards.<lb/> MSEs operating in the grey zone of semi-formality are hindered by lack of transparency, reducing the<lb/> flow of credit and capital funds at affordable cost. Small and micro firms compensate a thin resource base<lb/> with benefits from illegal activities (low operating costs and low entry and exit costs), while facing rising<lb/> domestic and international competition. According to partial and anecdotal evidence, many micro firms<lb/> have recently gone out of business, reducing employment in both tradable and non-tradable activities. 69<lb/> This points to deepening structural handicaps.<lb/></p>

			<head>a) Access to new technology and R&amp;D benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>While rapid progress has been made since the inception of the customs union with the EU in 1996,<lb/> investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) has remained low (</p>

			<table>Table 4.3). SMEs&apos;<lb/> awareness of e-business offering profitable business opportunities is still low. While Turkey&apos;s large<lb/> 69<lb/> OECD (2006), Economic Surveys Turkey.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> companies reached parity with the EU in terms of Internet access in 2005 (99%)</table>

			<p>, SMEs&apos; access lagged far<lb/> behind, the gap being negatively correlated with firm class size. Moreover, even though more than<lb/> three-fifths of SMEs (excluding micro firms) have a computer, the size of the information and technology<lb/> sector amounted to only 0.8% of GDP as against 3.3% for the EU15 average. Thus, the usage of ICT,<lb/> though rising, has left so far no marked impact on SMEs&apos; competitive position. 70 The depressed state of<lb/> technology has its main roots in weak innovative activity which is variously ascribed to:<lb/> • An extremely low ratio of R&amp;D expenditure to GDP (0.8% in 2005). R&amp;D personnel as a share<lb/> of total employment is still among the lowest in OECD countries notwithstanding a sharp rise in<lb/> the number of full-time equivalent R&amp;D personnel per 10 000 total employment over the past<lb/> few years. Most R&amp;D employees work for universities as distinct from research institutions.<lb/> Most developed countries display the opposite constellation.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Insufficient R&amp;D efforts in the private sector. The share of the business sector in total R&amp;D<lb/> expenditure is low (around 34% as against the OECD average of 65%) mainly reflecting limited<lb/> awareness of potential benefits flowing from R&amp;D activities. The number of SMEs carrying out<lb/> high-technology based activities is low. The co-operation between academia, public institutions<lb/> and industry is weak. Benefits from public research activities are rarely commercialised, while<lb/> industry&apos;s needs tend to be overlooked. Most research proposals originate in large cities in the<lb/> Western part of the country where most research centres and laboratories are located.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Inadequate funding for co-operative projects at universities, research laboratories and equipment.<lb/> Despite a university-based intellectual potential, university-industry interactions have remained<lb/> weak.<lb/> • Lack of finance for innovations and R&amp;D. Tax incentives have been modest, most of the support<lb/> going to large firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thanks to partnerships and financial linkages with multinational companies, large firms generally<lb/> have quick access to new technology, R&amp;D benefits and best practices. Some infrastructure costs, though,<lb/> related to information technology, are high by international comparison. Turkey still records far the highest<lb/> broadband prices per Mbit/s in the OECD area. By contrast, technological deficiency is acute for small and<lb/> micro firms, which suffer from shortages of human capital and financial resources, poorly functioning<lb/> markets and lack of understanding. In this setting, entrepreneurial demand for business support services<lb/> has remained low. There are signs of modest progress, though, R&amp;D spending rising to 0.8% of GDP in<lb/> 2005 from 0.61% in 2003. Moreover, the number of Turkish scientists&apos; publications has risen sharply,<lb/> reaching nearly 14 000 in 2004 compared with 9 300 in 2002.<lb/></p>

			<head>b) Access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Real interest rates, though sharply declining since 2001, have remained high by international<lb/> comparison. Turkey&apos;s short-term and long-term real interest rates averaged 8.3% in 2007 (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.4) as<lb/> against 4.6% for Mexico, a country with a comparable per-capita income, and 2% for the Euro area.<lb/> Official interest rates naturally represent a floor (minimum rates), with only a few large, top-graded<lb/> companies being able to borrow funds at this cost. For the overwhelming majority of other firms, real<lb/> interest rates are much higher, implying steep required rates of return on planned investment. The<lb/> unusually high level of capital user cost reflects both inefficient financial markets and a large current<lb/> account deficit of the balance of payments. The large excess of imports over exports (7.5% of GDP in<lb/> 2007) necessitates high internal interest rates so as to attract capital inflows on a scale which maintain<lb/> relative exchange rate stability.<lb/> A lack of formal credit funds and equity capital at affordable cost thus constitutes a severe constraint<lb/> to firm creation and firm expansion. Most banks refrain from making loans to SMEs reflecting the<lb/> government&apos;s dominant lender position and the lack of banking skills to underwrite such loans effectively.<lb/> As a result, less than 5% of available bank credit has been provided to industrial SMEs, which, as shown<lb/> above, account for no less than 99.5% of all industrial establishments. Despite rebounding credits to the<lb/> private sector following the banking crisis of 2000-01, most banks still lack basic expertise of how to lend<lb/> funds to SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>As informal firms&apos; financial accounts understate the true dimension of their activities, SMEs find it<lb/> difficult to win support from properly supervised banks. In the past, Turkish banks used to provide<lb/> informal and semi-informal firms with a limited amount of credit through a system of informal books and<lb/> bilateral information. Dynamic medium-sized enterprises (MSEs) still refrain from making ample use of<lb/> formal banking and financial services, formal credit costs being high, while benefits from informal<lb/> operations continue to be substantial. These enterprises are funded, to a large extent, by own-equity and<lb/> inter-enterprise trade credit, which serve as the main financing channels.<lb/> MSEs&apos; semi-informality is likely to become a serious hindrance in communication with other partners<lb/> such as joint-venture candidates, technology suppliers and new customers. Standard banking and financial<lb/> services will be increasingly needed, as the demand for and the potential supply of medium-to-long-term<lb/> investment credit is bound to rise rapidly. Enterprises&apos; investment for modernisation and long-term asset-<lb/>building implies increased demand for such funding. Recent entries of prime international banks have<lb/> widened the range of financial instruments for large firms and MSEs, 71 thus easing barriers to finance. In<lb/> contrast, micro firms&apos; access to finance is severely restricted by high costs of suppliers&apos; credits, lack of<lb/> banks&apos; ability to conduct small loan-operations and shortages of micro financial instruments backed by<lb/> government guarantees. There is no comprehensive micro-loan mechanism operating in Turkey.<lb/></p>

			<p>A 2005 survey of &quot; Small Enterprise Finance in Turkey &quot; (653 firms) conducted by Bankakadmie<lb/> International with the support of the EU and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (Germany) revealed<lb/> stringent collateral requirements by commercial banks as being the most important barrier to finance (83%<lb/> of firms) followed by &quot; excessively high interest rates &quot; (54% of firms) and cumbersome bureaucratic<lb/> procedures (26%). As a result, SMEs, especially in manufacturing, find it difficult to obtain sufficient<lb/> capital for their investment projects, notably in the start-up phase. Lack of start-up capital is seen as a<lb/> fundamental bottleneck for firm creation, SMEs having difficulties in providing required guarantees or<lb/> collateral. Insufficient capital appears to be the fundamental bottleneck for start-ups.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are only two operational venture capital investment trusts, ISRISK, a private company founded<lb/> in 2001 and KOBI, a public incorporated company acting as an efficient risk capital intermediary which<lb/> provides financial instruments to promising SMEs. The number of SMEs using venture capital is estimated<lb/> at 2%, a low number by international standards. Moreover, for credit guarantees, there is only one<lb/> organisation, the Credit Guarantee Fund Operating Research J.S.C. (KGF). Operating in Turkey since<lb/> 1994,. KGF, an intermediary organisation, permits SMEs with inadequate collaterals to apply for bank<lb/> credits reducing banks&apos; risks and increasing the number of their customers. A comprehensive system of<lb/> micro-finance does not exist in Turkey.<lb/> Thanks to the financial reform process, which began in 2001, financial institutions (banks, factoring<lb/> and leasing companies) appear to have become more willing to provide funds for SMEs, contributing to the<lb/> rise in the ratio of credits to GDP to 41% in 2006 from 23% in 2002. The volume of factoring and leasing<lb/> also increased, reaching, respectively, EUR 12 billion and EUR 4 billion in 2006. Overall, though,<lb/> financial institutions still view SME financing as being risky, yielding little profit. Supply and demand side<lb/> obstacles SME finance still reflect ineffective and insufficient numbers of financial instruments. 72<lb/></p>

			<head>c) Access to skilled labour and business services<lb/></head>

			<p>While recent decades have seen a swift expansion of access to school education, the quality of<lb/> education remains low at the majority of schools. 73 Education opportunities are unevenly distributed as the<lb/> education system focuses on good quality education for the most able students. Resources being skewed<lb/> towards the &apos;high end&apos;, the education system favours students from higher-income families who, after<lb/> university graduation, join the formal economy as employees. In this setting, the most binding human<lb/> capital deficiencies are to be found at the middle and low ends of the labour market. The stock of under-<lb/>educated adults is large, adversely affecting entrepreneurial activities of small</p>

			<table>and micro firms. While<lb/> opportunities for receiving entrepreneurship education and adult training opportunities are sparse, cultural<lb/> 71<lb/> OECD (2006), Economic Surveys Turkey.<lb/> 72<lb/> Ministry of Industry and Trade, Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme, November 2007.<lb/> 73<lb/> OECD (2006), Economic Surveys Turkey.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> factors hinder peoples&apos; propensity to choose entrepreneurship as a career. This is especially true for women<lb/> whose participation in entrepreneurial activity is extremely low.<lb/></table>

			<p>On the level of micro firms, the under endowment of human capital is the primary factor, shutting out<lb/> innovative activities and perpetuating low efficiency levels. On the level of MSEs semi-formality and lack<lb/> of funds often prevent purchases of high-quality managerial services and business services capable of<lb/> diffusing best-practice technology. High-skilled managers themselves avoid reputational and legal risks<lb/> associated with running semi-formal companies.<lb/> Access to business services supplied by public or private support units is constrained by chronic<lb/> demand deficiency. This varously reflects reduced visibility of available services and relatively high cost<lb/> for private counselling. The small average size of Turkish SMEs and, in particular, the large proportion of<lb/> micro firms, may contribute to these failings of the markets for support services. 74 Opportunities for<lb/> receiving entrepreneurship education per se are sparse.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> 1.<lb/> Overall aims of entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/></head>

			<p>For many years, Turkey&apos;s entrepreneurship and SME policies has been geared towards enhancing<lb/> productivity and competitiveness through spurring R&amp;D spending, innovation and the diffusion of ICT. In<lb/> 2002 new programmes and funding schemes were designed to this effect. These support programmes<lb/> focused on industry, often leaving out service activity. A broader industrial foundation was viewed as<lb/> being critical for both stronger international integration and reduced regional imbalances.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Entrepreneurship and SME policies in Turkey have been shaped over the past few years by a number<lb/> of factors (Box 4.1), including:<lb/> • The creation in 1996 of the Customs Union with the European Union. As a result, Turkish<lb/> industry became increasingly exposed to international competition, while SME support<lb/> programmes began to be designed within a framework of international co-operation.<lb/></figure>

			<table>• The ratification in 2002 of the European Charter for Small Enterprises which established an<lb/> international framework for conducting efficient SME policies. By adopting the EU-Charter for<lb/> SMEs, Turkey pledged to take concrete steps to conceive programmes and projects in all<lb/> important SME policy areas, including on-line access, access to finance and access to education<lb/> and training for entrepreneurs. Turkey considers the Charter as the foundation for its long-term<lb/> SME strategy (medium-term to long-term enterprise (SME) development strategy). 75<lb/> • Establishment of the EU-legal framework for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (2006), 76 (Annex<lb/> 4.A).<lb/> • Implementation of the &quot; Basel II &quot; prudential rules (2007).<lb/> • Preparation of the Operational Programme for Regional Competitiveness (RCOP) (2007).<lb/> 74<lb/> OECD (2004), Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Turkey, Issues and Policies, p. 20.<lb/> 75<lb/> OECD (2004), Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Turkey, Issues and Policies, p. 53.<lb/> 76<lb/> The EU legal framework for Pre-Accession assistance was established with the Council Regulation (EC)<lb/> No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006.<lb/> of the SME Charter of the 2003 Turkish National Programme for the adoption of the EU acquis.<lb/> The purpose of the plan was to raise the transparency of existing policies and programmes; to<lb/> define clearly the respective responsibilities for public and private organisations and to identify a<lb/> set of required activities. The plan was prepared by the SME Study Group composed of various<lb/> organisations mapping out SME strategies.<lb/> • The Specific Action Plan for 2004-06. This plan was geared towards buttressing industrial SMEs<lb/> by raising their level of technology, enlarging the flow of financial funds and augmenting the<lb/> quality of their products. Implementing this plan has been facilitated by a new consultative<lb/> committee involving private-sector representatives who work in unison with the State Planning<lb/> Organisation (SPO).<lb/> 2.<lb/> A new framework for entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> a)<lb/> The 9 th Development Plan (2007-2013)<lb/></table>

			<figure>A new phase of entrepreneurship and SME policies has opened up with the adoption in 2007 of the 9 th<lb/> Development Plan covering the period 2007-2013. This plan focuses on stronger R&amp;D spending and<lb/> innovation as indispensable structural tools to bolster the business sector. Aimed at lifting R&amp;D spending<lb/> to 2% of GDP in 2010 from 0.8% in 2005 the plan envisages the upgrading and expansion of the R&amp;D<lb/> infrastructure. To this end, public research institutes will be strengthened and private research centres<lb/> established. Academic R&amp;D activities will be increasingly oriented towards industrial needs implying<lb/> stronger collaborative links between universities and industry. The Plan also intends to complete the<lb/> building of Technology Development Zones (TDZs) and to create Technology Transfer Centres. Financial<lb/> underpinning of these projects is scheduled to come from new financial instruments capable of expanding<lb/> scarce supplies of venture capital for innovative SMEs (ISMEs) and high-growth SMEs (HGSMEs).<lb/> Innovative firms striving to overcome pressure from foreign low-cost competition will benefit from special<lb/> incentives.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The 9 th Development Plan also embodies a special strategy for balanced regional development. Aimed<lb/> at reducing stark regional disparities through stronger regional competitiveness the Plan adopts a &apos;Growth<lb/> Centres Approach&apos;. Under this approach, geographical areas with a high-growth potential are identified,<lb/> mainly inside less-developed regions. The main function of such growth centres is to install a balanced<lb/> physical and social infrastructure capable of generating new industrial &apos;focal points&apos;. According to the<lb/> Plan, such infrastructural &apos;magnets&apos; will eventually attract investment from both outside the region and<lb/> from outside Turkey. This &apos;Growth Centres Approach&apos; is also integrated into the Strategic Coherence<lb/> Framework as agreed by the EU-Commission in <ref type="biblio">June 2007.<lb/></ref> Accordingly, the SME Strategy and Action <ref type="biblio">Plan (2007-2009</ref>), covering the first three-year segment of<lb/> the 9 th Development Plan, focuses on lending support to new, innovative and competitive enterprises,<lb/> correcting past programme failures and a more stringent monitoring of policy outcomes. The plan singles<lb/> out several priority areas, including entrepreneurship development, firm creation, integration of SMEs into<lb/> international markets and national and international networks, improvement of the business environment,<lb/> diversification of financial instruments and expansion of technological and innovative capacity. In pursuit<lb/> of this aim, the plan offers training programmes for SMEs, encouraging them to participate in European<lb/> Technology Platforms. It also supports post-graduate studies of industry at university level Industrial<lb/> Thesis Supporting Programme (SANTEZ Project) and prepares the conversion of technology &apos;incubators<lb/> without walls&apos; into technology development centres.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The 9 th Development Plan and the SME Strategy and Action Plan have been shaped in line with the<lb/> 2006 EU legal framework governing pre-accession assistance (Annex 4.A).<lb/></figure>

			<head>3.<lb/> Principal stakeholders of entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/></head>

			<p>The government&apos;s main tool for implementing industrial entrepreneurship policy has been KOSGEB,<lb/> (Small and Medium Industry Development Organisation), a Public Agency affiliated with the Ministry of<lb/> Industry and Trade. Established by law in 1990 and subject to private law in all its transactions,<lb/> KOSGEB&apos;s mandate is to increase the weight and effectiveness of industrial SMEs and raise their<lb/> competitiveness. In line with this mandate, KOSGEB has designed numerous support programmes to<lb/> enhance technological skills, stimulate entrepreneurship, upgrade labour skills, spur R&amp;D efforts and<lb/> disseminate information which is relevant to SMEs. Programmes are developed by different directorates<lb/> within KOSGEB and they are implemented by the Enterprise Development Centers (IGEMs), the<lb/> Technology Development Centers (TEKMERs) and the Synergy Focal Points (Box 4.2).</p>

			<figure>In 2007,<lb/> KOSGEB employed 651 persons. Public expenditure associated with its programmes totalled<lb/> TYL 10 582 112 in 2007.<lb/> KOSGEB&apos;s TEKMERs act as incubators providing support for technology development through<lb/> know-how, material, equipment and office space. They have been established through protocols signed<lb/> between KOSGEB and universities and chambers of commerce; they service both start-ups and existing<lb/> innovative SMEs. In the areas where TEKMERs do not exist &apos;business incubators without walls&apos; provide<lb/> services to SMEs, excluding office allocation. IGEMs are mainly established in organised industrial zones<lb/> and provide services to manufacturing SMEs.<lb/> &apos;Synergy Focuses&apos; have been launched in 2004 to generalise services and assistance given to SMEs.<lb/> Exemplifying a new co-operation model (collaborative innovation) &apos;Synergy Focuses&apos; are established in<lb/> co-operation with the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB), Unions of<lb/> Artisans, Cooperatives of Artisans, Management Boards of Organised Industrial Zones (OIZ) and Small<lb/> Scale Industrial Estates (SSIE) as well as with SME foundations and associations.<lb/> Box 4.2.

The Under<lb/> Secretariat of Foreign Trade helps deploy programmes to spur SME creation. Business organisations such<lb/> as the TOBB and the Confederation of Tradesmen and Artisans of Turkey (TESK) play an important role in<lb/> implementing SME policies. Other non-governmental organisations involved in innovation-oriented<lb/> entrepreneurship and SME policy include the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV).<lb/></table>

			<head>4.<lb/> Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovative activities<lb/> a)<lb/> Better access to new technology, R&amp;D benefits and networking activities<lb/></head>

			<p>A key element in Turkey&apos;s efforts to raise the level of enterprises&apos; technology has been the expansion<lb/> and deepening of services support programmes, including a better adaptation of research activities to<lb/> business needs. Five main stakeholders are active in this field: the Ministry of Industry and Trade,<lb/> KOSGEB, the State Planning Organisation (SPO), the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey<lb/> (TTGV) and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). KOSGEB&apos;s<lb/> programmes, notably those applied by Enterprise Development Centres and Technology Development<lb/> Centres, are based upon best practice models from Europe, Asia and North America. Various &apos;services<lb/> stations&apos; provide a broad range of support services to new and existing small businesses in manufacturing<lb/> which strive to augment output, marketing and export capacity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under KOSGEB&apos;s programmes, small firms have access to managerial and technical assistance,<lb/> capital space, R&amp;D benefits and management training. In addition, they receive subsidies for recruiting and<lb/> managing personnel. In 2006, 2 767 small enterprises received assistance from both types of centres.<lb/> Public spending related to these activities amounted to TYK 15 187 258. TEKMER staff, a total of<lb/> 53 SME experts, provide consulting assistance, acting as guides to outside resources and not as direct<lb/> service providers per se.<lb/></p>

			<p>Teaching entrepreneurs how to access support services and convincing them to make use of<lb/> technological assistance is the most important function performed by TEKMERs. 78 They also help<lb/> establish better relationships between SMEs and technology service providers which are predominantly<lb/> public organisations. To strengthen the interaction between SMEs and universities, TEKMERs and<lb/> business incubators have begun to be established near universities. Currently, there are 20 TEKMERs<lb/> located in university campuses. Three of them are located in less-developed regions (NUTSII regions)<lb/> supporting 110 firms. In addition there are 7 &apos;incubators without walls&apos; located in Industrial Zones and<lb/> along with TEKMERs they support about 1 400 R&amp;D projects. Private companies (Ericsson, Koc Holding<lb/> and Siemens) have established business incubators of their own.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another programme creating ties between academia and the business sector is SANTEZ. This<lb/> programme sponsors graduate studies based upon requests by industry and stimulates the transmutation of<lb/> invention into innovation through innovation-oriented SMEs. Financial support of up to 75% of the project<lb/> budget is provided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade while the rest is covered by the company<lb/> commercialising the output.<lb/> In addition, Technology Development Zones (TDZs) have been created to help bridge the gap<lb/> between research activity and business needs. TDZs promote the use of high/advanced technologies and<lb/> related R&amp;D capabilities through co-operation between universities, research institutes and the productive<lb/> sector. Financial support is granted for land, infrastructure and construction of management buildings.<lb/></p>

			<head>78<lb/></head>

			<table>OECD (2004), Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Turkey, Issues and Policies, p. 63.<lb/> TDZs benefit from tax exemptions and incentives until 2014. There are 28 TDZs in Turkey of which 18 are<lb/> operational. They are mainly established by universities. Currently, nearly 800 firms are linked to TDZs<lb/> (99% of SMEs) and over 2 500 R&amp;D projects are underway.<lb/> Another stakeholder building links between universities, research centres and enterprises is the State<lb/> Planning Organisation (SPO) which issues guidelines for research, technology, development and<lb/> innovation. The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) implements<lb/> programmes to strengthen the collaboration between industry and the research community: ISBAB<lb/> supports initiatives to establish scientific and technological cooperation networks. EUREKA provides<lb/> R&amp;D network assistance for the &apos;Support Program for R&amp;D Projects Market Platform&apos;. Other TUBITAK<lb/> programmes stimulate private R&amp;D efforts and start-ups of innovation-oriented SMEs (TEKNOGISIM).<lb/> KOSGEB has also taken action to increase the flow of advisory services from professional<lb/> organisations and public institutions (universities) so as to create stronger links between SMEs and large<lb/> enterprises. This is being achieved through novel incentive mechanisms inducing SMEs to take advantage<lb/> of information and experience gathered by universities. TDCs and Chambers of Industry assist actual and<lb/> potential entrepreneurs to make use of both business incubators without walls and Innovation Relay<lb/> Centres (IRC). IRCs (a total of two, in 2007 Anatolia IRC and Ege IRC) have been incorporated into the<lb/> EU-IRC Network. Networking activity has also been strengthened with the creation of Synergy focal points<lb/> &apos; intermediate service stations&apos; placed between KOSGEB and TOBB.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Sectoral networking activity by NGOs has been intensified with the &apos;Fashion and Textile Cluster&apos;<lb/> (2003), an EU-funded project launched by the Istanbul Textile and Apparel Exporters&apos; Association<lb/> (ITKIP). The 2007 RCOP stimulates the formation of sectoral clustering and inter-regional network<lb/> building in the 12 NUTSII regions. The networking &apos;technology&apos; (collective process innovation) is based<lb/> upon results from EU-funded clustering and research projects, (GAP GIDEM, and SME development<lb/> project) executed by UNDP in conjunction with GAP Regional Development Administration for sectors<lb/> like marble, textile, confection and organic agriculture.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV) – a non-governmental independent not<lb/> for profit organisation in the science and research sector – also supports projects from the corporate sector.<lb/> The Foundation funds projects of Technoparks, TEKMERs, venture capital funds, start-up funds and joint<lb/> technology development projects. It has also supported the commercialisation of R&amp;D activities and risk<lb/> sharing. TTGV has provided USD 165 million to 473 technology development projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> Better access to finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Several targeted investment credit programmes serve to reduce user cost of capital and to overcome<lb/> the banking system&apos;s chronic inability to provide sufficient funds for SMEs. These programmes include:<lb/> • Release of funds by the Treasury to the Halk Bank, the Industrial Development Bank and other<lb/> banks. Loan parameters are established by agreement with the banks, the banks underwriting<lb/> loans and taking responsibility for defaults.<lb/></p>

			<table>• Following the signature of a protocol between KOSGEB, HalkBank Vakifbank and Ziraat Bank<lb/> in 2003, KOSGEB subsidises interest rates of credits provided by these banks. Under these<lb/> protocols, soft loans are extended to SMEs beset by short-term liquidity problems. While the<lb/> loans are accorded by banks, interest expenses are financed partially or fully by KOSGEB. In<lb/> 2003, more than 1 600 enterprises received EUR 70 million, a small amount relative to overall<lb/> bank loans.<lb/> • Repayable medium-term subsidies for industrial SMEs participating in KOSGEB&apos;s IGEMs and<lb/> TEKMERs. These subsidies are mainly used for investment in equipment and technology.<lb/> • Loans for the creation of small industrial estates or organised industrial zones opening access to<lb/> quality industrial space with the necessary utilities and central services. About two-thirds of the<lb/> industrial estates are privately funded. The government continues to release funds for the creation<lb/> of new estates, notwithstanding evidence of large excess capacity in many existing ones.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Investment allowances which are granted automatically at a rate of 40% to all investors<lb/> purchasing or producing fixed assets subject to depreciation with a value of more than<lb/> TKL 5 million. The State Aid Programme for SME investment is implemented by the Under<lb/> Secretariat of the Treasury.<lb/> • KOSGEB&apos;s financial incentives for business start ups of up to the equivalent of EUR 10 000 for<lb/> fixed investment and operating expenses. Capital funds for fixed investment up to EUR 8 000<lb/> must be paid back. Capital funds for operating expenses (up to EUR 2 000) do not have to be<lb/> paid back. Technological business start ups receive stronger financial support. Funds for fixed<lb/> investment must be repaid over a 4-year period, usually with a 1 year grace period. Start ups in<lb/> less-developed areas benefit from longer grace periods and more favourable repayment<lb/> schedules. Non-payback support is granted for counselling, R&amp;D applications, publication of<lb/> R&amp;D findings, leasing space in techno parks and export promotion purposes.<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Exemption of import duties and value-added tax payments for investment in equipment.<lb/> • Under the SME Finance Facility bank credits have been extended to SMEs located in<lb/> development areas at attractive interest rates. Surprisingly, the credit line provided by the<lb/> Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau has been underused. Banks have also lent funds to SMEs under<lb/> the Small Enterprise Loan Programme (SELP) concentrating on small loans with a maturity of<lb/> over a year. The SELP programme has had a noticeable impact on local economies and<lb/> secondary markets, enabling 2 300 job creations and saving 15 300 jobs. 79<lb/> • In 2007, the &quot; Basel II &quot; prudential rules have been implemented augmenting the transparency of<lb/> MSEs&apos; financial accounts. This is expected to stimulate supplies of long-term credits and venture<lb/> capital.<lb/> Credit guarantees for SMEs are mainly provided by KGF, the Credit Guarantee Fund, and<lb/> TESKOMB, the Union of Turkish Artisans and Craftsmen Credit Cooperatives. Established in 1994, KGF,<lb/> an intermediary organisation, enables access to credit for SMEs with inadequate collateral. In 2005, KGF<lb/> granted EUR 82 million worth of guarantees for 982 firms, mostly manufacturing firms (85%), while 5%<lb/> of total guarantees were extended to firms located in the Eastern Anatolian region. The amount of<lb/> guaranteed credit per unit of manufacturing firm population (EUR 410) is low. TESKOMB, an umbrella<lb/> organisation covering 921 Artisan and Craftsmen Credit and Guarantees Cooperatives, offers guarantees<lb/> for credits extended by Halbank. About 12% of artisan and craftsmen enterprises benefit from this<lb/> guarantee.<lb/> To reduce financial barriers for SMEs in less-developed regions, the IPA – RCOP (2007-2013)<lb/> (Annex 4.A) intends to establish and support micro-loan funds and equity finance mechanisms, including<lb/> venture capital funds, seed capital and start-up capital in the manufacturing and the tourist sector. Advisory<lb/> and consultancy services are scheduled to enhance the effects of these measures.<lb/> 79<lb/> Ministry of Industry and Trade, RCOP 2007, p. 44.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<p>Venture capital is supplied by KOBI and ISRISK, venture capital investment trusts. KOBI, a public<lb/> incorporated company, acts as a risk capital intermediary offering a range of financial instruments for<lb/> ISMEs and HSMEs. ISRISK is a private company established in 2001.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Better access to entrepreneurship education and training<lb/></head>

			<p>To upgrade entrepreneurial labour, KOSGEB, through its IGEMs and TEKMERs, operates a number<lb/> of employment support programmes. Both types of centres offer managerial and technical assistance for<lb/> hiring skilled labour. Public funds cover 60% of labour cost in developed regions for 12-18 months. Firms<lb/> located in less-developed regions receive a higher employment subsidy (80% of labour cost). KOSGEB<lb/> applies strict rules for maximum salaries to be paid for newly hired skilled labour. Technology-based<lb/> companies with R&amp;D activities receive special training support from TEKMERs to absorb new software<lb/> and information services.<lb/></p>

			<p>In parallel, KOSGEB&apos;s Centre for Entrepreneurship seeks to spur entrepreneurial activity by releasing<lb/> information about potentially viable business opportunities. Using market research findings which it has<lb/> sponsored or conducted the centre makes the information available through the network of IGEMs,<lb/> TEKMERs, OIZs and SSIEs. In addition, the centre systematically reviews and documents successful<lb/> business practices for inclusion in the KOBINET project, the SME network. The aim is here to stimulate<lb/> entrepreneurs&apos; use of the Internet, inviting them to enter e-commerce.<lb/> KOSGEB&apos;s programme for business start ups offers two types of training. General educational<lb/> services are supplied through KOSGEB&apos;s facilities dealing with basic managerial and technical issues.<lb/> Specialised training is provided by professional organisations (public or private) for entrepreneurial<lb/> activities not covered by KOSGEB&apos;s courses. The support ratio for general and special training is<lb/> regionally differentiated. KOSGEB covers up to 100% of the cost for general education services and up to<lb/> 80% and EUR 3 500 per firm for specialised training.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2004-2007, more than 15 000 persons received vocational training through KOSGEB&apos;s EU-Media<lb/> Projects on Clothing and Shoe Making. Thanks to this training, about 2 500 persons were able to find<lb/> employment.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>In its 2004 peer review of Turkish policies aimed at SMEs, the OECD deplored the general lack of<lb/> crucial elements for a proper policy evaluation. 80 At that time, Turkey had no exhaustive statistical census<lb/> of firms on the basis of homogenous definitions and criteria. Large numbers of firms in the informal<lb/> economy escaped investigation. Moreover, little was known about the cost of the support programmes for<lb/> SMEs. Some estimates for direct budgetary costs were available, but indirect costs caused by tax<lb/> allowances were hard to quantify. Last, but not least, large segments of the economy, such as tourism and<lb/> services, lay outside the scope of specific support policies.<lb/> Four years later, at the time of writing, most of these impediments are still hindering a proper, detailed<lb/> policy assessment. Broad indicators, though, point to significant progress having been made over the past<lb/> few years. This is manifest in better access to new technology, stronger R&amp;D spending, rising numbers of<lb/> R&amp;D personnel, improved business support services and networking facilities (collaborative innovations)<lb/> and enlarged business training opportunities.<lb/> 80<lb/> <ref type="biblio">OECD (2004)</ref>, <ref type="biblio">Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Turkey, Issues and Policies, p.7-8.<lb/></ref> In terms of Internet access, Turkey&apos;s large firms have reached parity with the EU in 2005. R&amp;D<lb/> expenditure, albeit still low by international standards, has risen to 0.8% of GDP in 2005. The range of<lb/> KOSGEB&apos;s support and research centres has widened, triggering welcome interactions between research<lb/> centres, universities and the business sector (synergy focal points, TEKMERs, IGEMs, TDZs, and<lb/> &apos;business incubators without walls&apos;). Finally, the number of entrepreneurial training beneficiaries and<lb/> training instructors has strongly increased, auguring stronger entrepreneurial and innovative activity.<lb/> Looking ahead, the recent strong internationalisation of Turkey&apos;s entrepreneurship and SME policies<lb/> is destined to strongly stimulate innovative activity. The opening of EU-accession negotiations (2004), the<lb/> establishment of an EU legal framework for Pre-Accession Assistance</p>

			<figure>(IPA) (2006) and the alignment of<lb/> SME support programmes on EU definitions (2006) are certain to impart new impulses to Turkey&apos;s<lb/> structural reform. The entrepreneurial and innovative dimension of this drive has found its principal<lb/> expression in the 2007 Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme (RCOP) (2007-2013), one of the<lb/> RCOP&apos;s main measures being to promote R&amp;D, innovation, the usage of technology and the increased<lb/> transfer of knowledge.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A constituent of Turkey&apos;s reform policy, RCOP rightly aims at strengthening competitiveness through<lb/> stronger entrepreneurship, better collaborative innovations and faster diffusion of ICT. In pursuit of these<lb/> aims, it adopts a &apos;growth centre approach&apos;, identifies economic &apos;magnets&apos; (growth centres with a high-<lb/>growth potential) and relies on a &apos;bottom-up&apos; approach (interaction between nucleus and periphery). RCOP<lb/> has also aimed at increasing regional co-operation by ensuring the interaction of &apos;growth centers&apos; with their<lb/> hinterland and by connecting target regions to the rest of the country. Representing a coherent new<lb/> framework for entrepreneurship and SME policies RCOP seeks to redress ingrained structural imbalances<lb/> which past policies have failed to correct.<lb/></p>

			<head>a)<lb/> The need for a broader support programme approach<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a strong need to broaden the support programme approach. For many years, Turkey has<lb/> favoured industrial SME assistance providing relatively high levels of support for comparatively small<lb/> numbers of firms. These trends have broadly continued in 2007, 2 223 industrial SMEs benefiting from<lb/> KOSGEB&apos;s support programme and 9 826 industrial SMEs receiving KOSGEB&apos;s support credit. The<lb/> greater part of entrepreneurial assistance for industry went to firms with more than 10 employees. This<lb/> kind of aid concentration naturally mirrors business owners&apos; and managers&apos; level of educational<lb/> attainment, a key factor determining firms&apos; propensity to demand assistance and their capacity to absorb<lb/> government help.<lb/> While Turkey, a participant in the European BEST-programme, has increasingly applied European<lb/> standards to SME support programmes, assistance continued, until recently, to be biased in favour of<lb/> industry shutting out large segments of the economy (wholesaling, retailing and tourism). A different,<lb/> broader policy approach, awarding smaller assistance to a much larger number of potential entrepreneurs<lb/> and SMEs in all economic sectors, could be more effective in spurring innovation and firm creation. For<lb/> this reason, KOSGEB&apos;s mandate has been extended in 2008 to cover some categories of non-industrial<lb/> SMEs.<lb/> A broader support policy approach based on best-practice programmes is known to be effective in<lb/> making greater numbers of small and micro firms more efficient. In its latest Economic Survey of <ref type="biblio">Turkey<lb/> (2006)</ref> the OECD underscored the importance of sectoral productivity convergence: &quot; Raising productivity<lb/> in the least productive sectors and firms would significantly increase average productivity levels. This<lb/> convergence implies overcoming the deep duality persisting in the labour market as the uneven educational<lb/> background of individuals determine their degree of participation in the labour force notably women and<lb/> their ability to work in the formal vs. informal sectors. &quot; A broader policy approach, though, requires a<lb/> strongly improved policy co-ordination among principal stakeholders of entrepreneurship and SME<lb/> policies. Being a condition sine qua non for improving the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of<lb/> support programmes these organisational and institutional desiderata have been integrated into the 2007<lb/> RCOP.<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> The need for entrepreneurial education and training opportunities<lb/></head>

			<p>Achieving greater productivity convergence among different firm categories (highly efficient large<lb/> firms, efficient medium-sized firms and inefficient small and micro firms) requires a strong extension of<lb/> educational opportunities to all segments of the society. In the long run, entrepreneurship policies tend to<lb/> strengthen innovation trends through the systematic introduction of entrepreneurial education in schools<lb/> and universities, the expansion of computer use in schools and universities and the creation of small<lb/> innovation laboratories in schools. Opportunities for entrepreneurial education should also be extended to<lb/> research centres, allowing researchers to eventually establish firms. A case in point is France&apos;s public<lb/> IT-research institute INRIA which, through in situ entrepreneurship education, has helped researchers set<lb/> up their own firms. Overall, Turkey&apos;s progress in the domain of entrepreneurial education appears to be<lb/> fractional relative to adjustment requirements.<lb/> Basic entrepreneurial training courses for aspiring and actual entrepreneurs are known to be highly<lb/> effective in quickly removing inefficiencies of production via process innovation. This includes making<lb/> entrepreneurs aware of support options and teaching them how to apply for assistance and how to put<lb/> credit funds to best use. In this domain, Turkey has made significant progress over the past few years, as is<lb/> evident in the rising number of training beneficiaries and instructors.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> The need for differentiated support services and network building<lb/></head>

			<p>Given large gaps between levels of educational attainment, the provision of support services, whether<lb/> in the area of human capital, finance or technology, should be in consonance with the size of firms, firm<lb/> owners educational attainment and related productivity levels. As it stands, the system of service providers<lb/> (support units) has not yet fully embraced the heterogeneity of firms and potential entrepreneurs in both<lb/> breadth and depth. On the other hand, low visibility of existing programmes has led, in some areas, to low<lb/> demand for support services. The &apos;growth centres&apos; approach adopted by the 9 th Development Plan and<lb/> RCOP (2007-2013), widening the range of support services and augmenting their visibility, should<lb/> strongly narrow the gap between demand and supply.<lb/> Providing better educational and training opportunities for aspiring and actual entrepreneurs is now<lb/> rightly seen as requiring flexible network building among different categories of service providers. One<lb/> priority area is elementary training services for micro firms which could be vastly expanded using<lb/> collaborative innovations (collective process innovations). These include using mobile business<lb/> development centres which offer training services in the &apos;hinterland&apos; of less developed regions as well as<lb/> using mobile banking vans which extend micro-credits secured by new financial instruments. The<lb/> programmed interaction between &apos;growth centres&apos; and the &apos;periphery&apos; is a step in the right direction. While<lb/> progress has been made in standardising and certifying training activities, there is little evidence of<lb/> experience-sharing among Turkey&apos;s public training support units. Such sharing needs to be encouraged<lb/> using best-practice experience gathered by other countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>d)<lb/> The need for a new financial infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>Notwithstanding a welcome rise in SMEs&apos; bank credit over the past few years, there is a persistent<lb/> important lack of funds (credit supplies and venture capital), financial instruments, support services and<lb/> efficient financial networking activity. On the supply side, real interest rates, though falling, are still<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/> extremely high by international comparison. The underlying capital shortage implies high required rates of<lb/> return on capital, damping firm creation, firm expansion and innovation. Moreover, real interest rates are<lb/> negatively correlated with firm size, micro firms facing particularly steep barriers to finance. In this<lb/> setting, the internationalisation of SME activities takes on particular importance as rising SME exports<lb/> reduce the current account deficit, widening the space for interest rates to decline. In this sense, raising<lb/> SME exports tends to ease SMEs&apos; access to finance with the passage of time.<lb/></p>

			<p>A narrow range of banking and financial services aggravates Turkey&apos;s structural scarcity of capital.<lb/> Private banks are not accustomed to extending credits to small and micro firms on a large scale. There is<lb/> little expertise in assessing loan applications from firms which have no or little collateral. Moreover, a<lb/> comprehensive loan guarantee programme modelled on successful systems applied by Germany, the World<lb/> Bank or Mexico does not exist nor is there a government-sponsored, large network of certified credit<lb/> advisors.<lb/> A broad financial infrastructure for micro firms is inexistent. There is a strong need to expand micro<lb/> financial services, establishing a comprehensive network of micro finance institutions. Experience in other<lb/> countries shows that using mobile banking vans along with mobile business development centres helps<lb/> low-income clients overcome strong barriers to finance. In the absence of such a financial infrastructure,<lb/> banks find it rational to engage in credit rationing regardless of firms&apos; willingness to accept more stringent<lb/> credit terms. 81 Provisions contained in the RCOP appear to be small relative to large adjustment<lb/> requirements in this area.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the credit demand side, small and micro firms&apos; credit requests thus continue to be restrained by<lb/> stringent collateral requirement, and high interest rates charged by informal money lenders. Firms<lb/> generally view stringent collateral requirements by commercial banks as being the most important barrier<lb/> to finance, while insufficient venture capital represents the fundamental bottleneck for start-ups. There are<lb/> only two operational venture capital investment trusts in Turkey.<lb/></p>

			<p>In an appropriate financial setting, private banks and intermediate financial institutions are shielded<lb/> by an efficient, national guarantee programme under which credit funds are channelled to small and micro<lb/> firms at affordable cost. This setting would also include new financial instruments, a vastly expanded<lb/> network of credit advisory services for these enterprises and information exchange among all financial<lb/> stakeholders. Credit transaction costs would fall, easing small and micro firms&apos; entry into the formal<lb/> economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Through state-owned banks, the government has made credit available to develop small-scale<lb/> industrial estates (SSIE) with access to industrial space, utilities and central services. In addition, numerous<lb/> tax incentives and offsets (tax credits) serve to stimulate the SMEs&apos; purchases of capital equipment. But<lb/> however useful such measures may have been for a few companies, they cannot replace the potential<lb/> benefits from a comprehensive support structure meeting, with resilience, the financial needs of different<lb/> business categories.<lb/></p>

			<figure>While MSEs and large enterprises generally escape from credit restraints, they continue to face an<lb/> acute shortage of venture capital and business angels, damping innovative initiatives. In 2005, most<lb/> Turkish MSEs remained reluctant to publish financial statements audited by independent, external auditors.<lb/> Only 3-4% of registered MSEs appear to have standard business plans, slowing the inflow of long-term<lb/> 81<lb/> OECD (2007), The SME Financing Gap, Volume I, Theory and Evidence.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2008)5<lb/></figure>

			<p>capital. From 2007, however, the implementation of the &quot; Basel II &quot; prudential rules is expected to change<lb/> the way banks allocate capital to risk. 82<lb/></p>

			<head>e)<lb/> The need for stronger vertical linkages<lb/></head>

			<p>Upgrading the tangible and intangible human capital of SMEs paves the way for building vertical<lb/> links with large companies. In many countries, the growing specialisation of industries has led to more<lb/> diversified production modes, with many semi-finished goods assembled to produce final products. Several<lb/> low per capita income countries, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme<lb/> (UNDP), have drawn up programmes for suppliers&apos; development allowing SMEs to become members of<lb/> vertical supply chains. Such links have been created in industry as well as in the services sector (e.g.<lb/> hospitals and restaurants in Mexico).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Involving continuous interactions between large firms and SMEs, vertical links strengthen process<lb/> innovations of both suppliers and final producers. 83 Despite the creation of Organised Industrial Zones and<lb/> small-scale industrial estates, Turkey still has ample room for exploiting the potential of such chain-based<lb/> innovations. Activating this potential should become possible with the RCOP&apos;s &apos;growth centre&apos; approach.<lb/> The 2005 EU-funded project &apos;Development of a Clustering Policy in Turkey&apos; should contribute to the<lb/> process of enhanced network building.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>A successful entrepreneurship and SME policy evolves through time with the maturing of both<lb/> innovative processes and supporting service units. Three policy phases can be usefully distinguished, the<lb/> first one spurring R&amp;D and innovation so as to create vast segments of ISMEs and HSMEs. During the<lb/> second phase, the innovations are spread through improved scientific-technological networks, specialised<lb/> institutions and better access to finance (including venture capital). In the third and final phase, the<lb/> innovative momentum gathers pace stimulated by learning effects and the transition to the knowledge<lb/> economy.<lb/> As regards large, industrial firms and MSEs, Turkey has, over the past few years, made significant<lb/> progress in the first two policy phases of this process. This is evident in stronger R&amp;D efforts, better<lb/> education and training opportunities, stronger innovative activity and expanded support services and<lb/> networking facilities. As a result, most large firms and many MSEs are internationally competitive. At the<lb/> same time, though, this progress has been unequal, as vast numbers of small and micro firms outside<lb/> industry (oversupply of subsistence entrepreneurship) continue to lack access to technology, education,<lb/> training and finance.<lb/> Stimulating the growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity of these &quot; excluded &quot; firms requires broadened<lb/> support programmes (covering non-industrial sectors), tailor-made network building (bundling of micro<lb/> firms for vertical and horizontal purposes) as well as better policy co-ordination among major stakeholders<lb/> of entrepreneurship and SME policy. It also requires determined efforts to use international best practices<lb/> to bring real interest rates down from abnormally high levels. Experience has shown that falling interest<lb/> rates combined with rising supplies of collateral-free funds will ease firms&apos; entry into the formal economy.<lb/> Moreover, creating collaborative innovations will help small and micro firms enter international markets.<lb/> Rising SME exports will then contribute to reducing the large current account deficit, opening doors for<lb/> interest rates to fall. This sequence points to the indirect link connecting the internationalisation of SME<lb/> activities and the easing of barriers to finance.</p>

			<p>RCOP, a principal policy instrument to achieve faster convergence with the EU, has two main<lb/> priorities: the improvement of the business environment (&apos;macro scale intervention axis&apos;) and the<lb/> bolstering of enterprise capacity and entrepreneurial activity (&apos;micro scale intervention axis&apos;). Widening<lb/> KOSGEB&apos;s mandate, RCOP focuses on manufacturing, tourism, information society, R&amp;D and innovation<lb/> in regions with a per capita income of less than 75% of the Turkish average (&apos;thematic and geographical<lb/> concentration&apos;). According to this criterion, there are 12 underdeveloped regions (NUTSII regions or<lb/> nomenclature of territorial units) where 26% of all firms are located, mostly in the Eastern part of the<lb/> country. Inside these regions, 15 growth centres with a high growth potential have been identified<lb/> harbouring about 14% of all firms. Under the macro-scale intervention axis, RCOP strives to establish an<lb/> effective R&amp;D, innovation, ICT and tourism infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<p>To this end, RCOP places strong emphasis upon inter-regional co-operation as well as upon<lb/> interaction between &apos;growth centres&apos; and their hinterland (interaction between nucleus and periphery) and<lb/> between target regions and the rest of the country (collaborative innovation or collective process<lb/> innovation). Under the micro-scale intervention axis, RCOP seeks to develop export-oriented innovative<lb/> HSMEs relying on a wider range of better business consultancy services. The integration of SMEs into<lb/> international markets is rightly seen as a key route to reducing Turkey&apos;s large current account deficit. A<lb/> smaller excess of imports over exports creates room for lower domestic interest rates, thereby easing firms&apos;<lb/> access to finance.</p>
