	<note type="other">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<lb/> This study was carried out thanks to a voluntary contribution from France and written up by members<lb/> of the Health Division of the OECD. France is thus often prominent in the qualitative and quantitative<lb/> analyses presented in this document. The opinions expressed in it are those of the authors and do not<lb/> necessarily reflect those of the OECD or the French Government. The various figures and tables are taken<lb/> from OECD Health Statistics 2013 unless stated otherwise. The authors would like to thank the following<lb/> for supporting this project and for their comments: Agence Technique de l&apos;Information sur<lb/> l&apos;Hospitalisation (ATIH), especially Véronique Sauvadet, Nathalie Rigollot and Florence Pinelli, also the<lb/> Direction Générale de l&apos;Offre de Soins, especially Adeline Townsend and Adrien Dozol. The authors are<lb/> also grateful to those who helped them in the countries used for the case studies:</note>
