This Working Paper incorporates Chapter 3 of the OECD&apos;s 2009<lb/> Survey of Slovenia which was prepared under the responsibility of the Economic and Development<lb/> Review Committee. The author is grateful for the valuable comments received on earlier drafts of this text<lb/> from Andrew Dean, Bob Ford, Pierre Beynet and other colleagues in the Economics Department, as well as<lb/> for discussions with officials from the Slovenian government. Special thanks go to Desney Erb of the<lb/> OECD Economics Department for statistical assistance.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Private sector gross earnings rose by around 6½ per cent in 2007 and 8½ per cent in 2008, compared with<lb/> an average of 3½ per cent per annum over the period 2003-06 when the unemployment rate was close to<lb/> the NAIRU.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The relatively high participation rate is partly due to the structure of the Slovenian population with almost<lb/> no foreigners and relatively few low-skilled persons. ECB (2008) argue that although the observed<lb/> Slovenian participation rate is above the euro area average it would be clearly below that average if<lb/> Slovenia were to have the same population composition as the euro area as a whole.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The numbers refer to persons who retired in 2007 under general and special regulation and are taken from<lb/> the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance of Slovenia (ZPIZ, 2008).

            <figDesc>28.<lb/> In addition the issue could be tackled more directly. Several initiatives have been taken in the<lb/> past to promote lifelong learning in Slovenia. In 2006, the National Professional Qualifications Act was<lb/> amended, introducing a system of recognition of non-formal and informal training. Under the Act,<lb/> individuals can obtain a certificate demonstrating that they have the professional or vocational<lb/> competencies necessary to exercise a profession based on either direct demonstration of knowledge, skills<lb/> and competencies, or based on documents and other proof collected by the applicant.
