few years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the export of raw materials 
which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper 
provides information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international 
disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, 
including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream 
processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions 
take various forms such as export duties, quantitative restrictions, and licensing requirements. The number 
of countries applying export duties over the period 2003-2009 was higher than in previous years and that 
such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current 
WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive 
discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral 
levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been 
discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture 
negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of 
export duties. Export restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic 
processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an 
advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives, 
not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of 
the significant impacts of export restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and 
implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. Keywords Export restrictions, export duties, quantitative restrictions, export licensing, raw materials, food security,

Its main purpose is to provide 
information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international disciplines on 
the measures. New material provided here is mostly based on WTO Trade Policy Review (TPR) papers. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental 
protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, 
controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms 
such as export duties, minimum export prices, and reduction of VAT rebates which directly affect export 
prices. Other forms include export bans, quotas, and licensing requirements which affect export volumes. A number of trends concerning the use of export restrictions can be identified from a review of WTO 
TPR country reports. One observes, for example, that the percentage of countries applying export duties 
over the period 2003-2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced 
primarily by developing and least developed countries; examples of items most subject to export duties 
were mineral and metal products, forestry, fishery and agricultural products, as well as those made from 
leather, hide and skin. It also becomes apparent that when compared to export duties, quantitative 
restrictions were more broadly used for social policy objectives, such as environmental protection or 
conservation of natural resources. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, 
there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the 
multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process does impose, however, several disciplines as 
evidenced by the Chinese accession process. Export restrictions have been also discussed during the DDA 
negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several 
regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of export duties. Export restrictions result in losses of efficiency by inducing too much production in the exporting 
country's downstream industry. Such measures also have income redistribution effects by penalizing 
exporters of the restricted product while benefiting domestic processing industries. The measures create a 
differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, 
and thus provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. When designing export restrictions, several factors should be carefully considered: (1) whether the 
measures are effective in achieving intended policy objectives; (2) whether the benefit of the measures 
outweighs the cost; and (3) whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least trade distorting ways. 
Considering that export duties and quantitative restrictions are substitutable, more attention is necessary 
regarding uneven discipline between these measures. In view of the significant impacts of export 
restrictions on global supply chains, transparency regarding the use and implementation of the measures 
should be substantially improved. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 5 I. 
Introduction 1. 
In recent years, export restrictions have continued to attract the attention of trade policy makers, 
both as a perceived means to achieve certain objectives and because of perceived gaps in international 
disciplines on their use. For example, following the peso devaluation in 2002, Argentina once again 
applied export duties to all exports in order to cushion the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations on 
domestic products and to counter the sharp fall in tax revenue. After successive increases in rates, the 
applicable duties were 5, 20, 15, 20, 25 and 45% (depending on products) as of mid-2006. 1 In 2007, China 
eliminated value added tax (VAT) rebates on exports for 553 items to restrain the export of products 
regarded as highly energy consuming, highly polluting, and consuming large amount of raw materials. 2 
Since 1999, Cameroon has gradually prohibited exports of logs in order to promote the processing 
industry. From 1999 until the prohibition of log exports in 2004, a certificate of registration had to be 
obtained to export timber; this was intended to ensure that 70% of production was processed locally and 
only 30% of the annual harvest exported as logs. 3 These examples display various objectives and methods 
by which governments apply export restrictions. 2. 
By affecting the price and quantity of trade, export restrictions produce trade distorting effects in 
the same way as import restrictions, but their incidence differs. However, multilateral disciplines on export 
restrictions are not as clearly defined as those on import restrictions. The WTO accession negotiation in 
general complemented disciplines on export restrictions, especially regarding export duties. During the 
Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, countries communicated their positions on the scope and 
modalities of future negotiations, inter alia in the case of export restrictions. Bilateral negotiation of RTAs 
has been another channel for providing more discipline. 3. 
On the basis of this background, this paper offers an overview of the current situation, as well as 
updating two previous papers on export restrictions which described the situation as of 2002. 4 The present 
paper analyses factual information of such measures based on Trade Policy Review (TPR) reports and 
describes key findings. Current discipline on export restrictions in the WTO is examined. It also analyses 
recent trends with respect to disciplines at both the bilateral and multilateral levels. Finally, this paper 
provides policy considerations regarding such measures. II. 
Definition 4. 
Defining the term  " export restriction "  is the first challenge. A panel under the WTO Dispute 
Settlement Understanding, in the context of the application of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures 
(SCM) Agreement, delineated the scope of  " export restraint "  as  " a border measure that takes the form of a 
government law or regulation which expressly limits the quantity of exports or places explicit conditions 
on the circumstances under which exports are permitted, or that takes the form of a government-imposed 
fee or tax on exports of the products calculated to limit the quantity of exports. 5  "  The WTO's Trade Policy 1. 
See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Argentina (WT/TPR/S/176). 2. 
In China, exporters are entitled to VAT rebates although VAT is not necessarily rebated fully on exports. 
When VAT rebate rates on exports are lower than the VAT rates actually paid, the difference between the two 
rates constitutes a levy on exports. See WTO Trade Policy Review Paper on China (WT/TPR/S/199). 3. 
See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Cameroon (WT/TPR/S/187). 4. 
Analysis of non-tariff measures: the case of export duties, TD/TC/WP(2002)54/FINAL and Analysis of non-
tariff measures: the case of export restrictions, TD/TC/WP(2003)7/FINAL. 5. 
This case deals with the relation between export restrictions and subsidy. The question was whether US 
regulations that treat a restraint on exports of a product as a subsidy to other products made using or 
incorporating the restricted product was consistent with the WTO SCM Agreement (WT/DS194/R). TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 6 Review (TPR) papers deal with export restrictions in the section on  " measures directly affecting exports. "  
Under this heading, in addition to export-incentive measures (i.e. export subsidies; duty and tax drawback; 
export processing zone; export finance, insurance and guarantees; and other export promotion measures), 
the TPRs cover export-restrictive measures (typically, export prohibitions, export quotas, export licensing, 
export duties and levies, and minimum export prices). Considering the fact that minimum export price and 
reduction of VAT rebates have similar effects as other traditional export restrictions, this paper follows the 
broader definition of export restriction used in the WTO TPR papers. 5. 
One of the most popular forms of export restrictions is export duties. This paper makes no 
distinction between the terms  " export duties "  and  " export taxes. "  Both are used here in the sense of 
(customs) duties on export. This does not include tax credit on exports, which might be well discussed as 
export subsidies in the context of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. A variety of 
similar or complementary terms also exist, such as export tariffs, export fees, export charges, and export 
levies. However, this paper prefers  " export duties "  or  " export taxes "  to the others. 6. 
Export duties can take different forms. It can be an ad valorem tax, specified as a percentage tax 
of the value of the product; or a specific tax, specified as a fixed amount to pay per unit of a product. All 
types of export taxes have the effect of raising the cost of exports, and thereby reducing the volume of 
exports. 6 As shown below, minimum export price and reduction of VAT rebate rates may produce effects 
similar to export duties. 7. 
Other forms of export restrictions directly affect the quantity of exports. The most extreme case 
of restrictions is export prohibition. Export quotas are restrictions or ceilings imposed by an exporting 
country on the total volume of certain products. Export license requirements establish that an application or 
other documentation should be submitted as a condition for exportation and depending on whether license 
acquisition is automatic, the requirements may affect the volume of exports. However, despite the 
potentially negative impact on exports, export licensing has drawn relatively less attention, partly because 
it is difficult to acquire information on this measure. Enhancing transparency on export licensing was 
proposed during the WTO DDA negotiations. III. 
Use of export restrictions during 2003-2009 8. 
The most systematic information available on export restrictions is found in Trade Policy Review 
(TPR) country reports. TPR reports of WTO members include a section on measures affecting exports, and 
more or less address export duties, quotas, licensing and other similar measures. The contents vary 
reflecting each country's situation at the time the reviews were undertaken. Therefore, it is difficult to 
compare between members and to draw quantitative conclusions; certain tendencies can be observed, 
however, from these reports. A. 
Export duties and other measures affecting export prices 9. 
The number of countries applying export duties (65 of 128 WTO members) during 2003-2009 is 
higher than it was in the previous analysis (39 of 100 WTO Members during 1997-2002). On a regional 
basis, the increase in the number of countries imposing export duties is clear regarding the Americas and 6. 
Export duties should be distinguished from fees and formalities, prohibiting fees and other charges rendered in 
connection with exportation (or importation) that are addressed under Article VIII (a) of the GATT 1994. It 
stipulates that fees and other charges shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a 
taxation of imports or exports for fiscal purposes. It applies to all fees and fomalities whatever its nature, but 
explicitly states that  " export duty "  is excluded from the application. Therefore, a distinction should be drawn 
between export duties and fees or charges, even though in specific cases the substance of the measures might 
be similar and thus difficult to distinguish. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 7 Africa, where in 1997-2002 the numbers were 9 out of 26 and 17 out of 26 countries respectively. 7 As was 
the case in the earlier 2002 analysis, export duties were imposed mainly by developing and least developed 
countries during 2003-2009 period (Table 1). Table 1. Number of countries applying export duties, by regions and other groupings

counted as 25 (considering 2 other countries were under TPR review during this period before they became EU members). 10. 
The items most affected by export duties are agricultural products, mineral and metal products, 
leather, hide and skin products, forestry products, and fishery products. (Table 2) Table 2. TPR Summary of current situation on export duties,

36 TPR reports do not specify precise HS number of products subject to export duties. Therefore, this classification is based upon the 
description of the products in the reports. In this table, hides and skins have been grouped with leather rather than agricultural 
products. Products listed are not exhaustive; Comprehensive details are in Annex 1. B. 
Quantitative restrictions 11. 
TPR country reports describe export prohibitions and export licensing in various ways. Because 
of the variety of length of the sections in the member reports, it is hard to analyse these points 
quantitatively, although certain tendencies can be observed. It is noted that no systematic distinction 
between automatic and non-automatic export licensing is made in these reports and that export prohibitions 
and licensing are being reviewed jointly. 12. 
In many cases, quantitative restrictions are applied by governments in relation to Articles XI:1(a), 
XX and XXI of GATT 1994. This includes conservation of exhaustible natural resources, environmental 7. 
The Members reviewed in previous and present analysis are different, and the increase in the numbers results 
partially from the fact that there were Members not subjected to analysis during 1997-2002. Still, several 
Members which did not maintain export duties during 1997-2002 applied new measures during 2003-2008. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 8 protection, and control of weapons and arms trade. Where there are multilateral agreements or 
arrangements, the legitimacy of export restrictions is well recognised, particularly in such areas as security, 
life, public health, safety and environmental reasons. A good example is CITES, the convention on 
international trade of endangered species of fauna and flora. This explains why most WTO members 
maintain quantitative restrictions regarding exports of some products. Even countries which do not apply 
export duties generally maintain quantitative restrictions on some exports. To a lesser degree, quantitative 
restrictions are used for industrial policy objectives to help develop higher value-added downstream 
industries. (See Annex 2 for comprehensive details.) 13. 
In OECD (2003), around 20 Members described export quotas in response to restrictions by 
importing members under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). However, 1 January 2005 
marked the end of the ten-year transition period towards the elimination of quantitative restrictions on 
imports of textile and clothing under the WTO ATC. Therefore, export quotas for this purpose disappeared 
in many countries. International commodity agreements or arrangements are also stated as justification for 
measures taken for agricultural products — such as sugar and coffee — diamonds and crude oil. 8 Box 1. Illustrative list of rationales for export restrictions in TPRs 1.

Major policy objectives 14. 
The major policy objectives of export restrictions are: @BULLET 
Fiscal receipts or revenue purposes (export duties). o Export duties may be seen as a reliable source of revenue, particularly in LDCs. 9 The 
relative ease of implementing tax regulations through customs may make this an attractive 
option for governments. Especially when international price is high, applying high tax 
rates is sometimes used to address equity issues. o This source of revenue is becoming less important for many countries. Although TPR 
reports do not provide consistent data for all countries, the share of export duties in 
government revenue is falling in several countries. In Ghana, the share of export duties in 
total government revenue decreased from 11.4% (1998) to 2.3% (2005). In Thailand, the 
contribution of export taxes to government revenue was only 0.3% of total tax revenue in 
2005/06. The Philippine authorities also indicated that revenue from export taxes was 
minimal. o The exception is Argentina. Between 2002 and 2005, income from export duties 
represented 9.9% of total public revenue. Following the peso devaluation in 2002, all 
Argentine exports were again made subject to export duties. Since 2002, successive 
resolutions have altered export tax rates, with increases on a significant number of 
products. As of mid-2006, the applicable duties were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 45% on the 
f.o.b. value, depending on the products in question. However, during the TPR Q&A in 
2007, several Members questioned the necessity of this high tax rates considering change 
of the economic situation during the last five years. @BULLET 
To protect and promote downstream processing industries by providing domestic industries with 
cheap raw materials and inputs. o Even in cases where countries do not present this as an explicit policy objective, this can 
be a major implicit motivation for export restrictions. Either export duties or quantitative 
restrictions are used for this purpose. 10 Still, considering the fact that the price differential 
between domestic and export price is the key component for this purpose, export duties are 
preferred for this purpose. o Export restrictions provide downstream processing industries with an advantage. 
Differential export duty rates play an important role in this regard: higher rates for raw 
materials or input products while lower rates apply for finished products. For example, in 
Argentina the export duty rates for soybean, soybean oil and biodiesel were 27.5%, 24.5%, 
and 5% respectively as of 2007. 11 The price advantage provided to domestic downstream 9. 
Among the 25 LDCs under TPR review between 2003-2009, 21 countries maintained export duties. 10. 
For example, the WTO TPR paper provided that one of the major objectives of Indonesia's quantitative 
restrictions was to promote higher value-added downstream industries. Mongolia's export prohibition of raw 
hides and cashmere was also maintained to protect domestic processors. 11. 
The rationale for differential export taxes was discussed during TPR process. When asked for the reason for 
maintaining differential export taxes, Argentina stated that its existence and permanence was closely linked to 
the payment capacity of each industry. Argentina further provided that the export tax rate differential was an TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 10 industries can distort and reduce competition in both domestic and foreign markets. 
(OECD, 2009c). @BULLET 
Social policy objectives, such as environmental protection or conservation of natural resources o This is the most popular and basic policy objective of quantitative restriction on exports. 
For these objectives, limiting the volume of trade is the key factor and that is why 
quantitative restrictions are preferred in this regard. Still, to a lesser degree, export duties 
are also used to achieve these policy objectives. 12 o As stipulated in Article XX of GATT 1994, this objective is consistent with WTO rules 
under certain conditions. 13 Therefore, even quantitative restrictions, which are generally 
prohibited, can be justified if such measures meet certain conditions of WTO provisions. o During the questions and answers exercise of the TPR, the Chinese government explained 
that the application of interim export duties and the reduction of VAT rebates were aimed 
at reducing exports of products that are highly energy consuming and polluting. Some 
Members questioned the effectiveness of these measures, displaying concern that such 
measures could result in increased domestic supply of products without a reduction in 
production. 14 The Indonesian government stated environmental conservation as the 
rationale for its export taxes on logs. In response to this justification, the TPR report 
pointed out that lowering domestic log prices by export taxes would encourage processors 
to expand production, but reduce the financial incentives for processors to adopt efficient, 
less wasteful technology and processing practices, and that the incentives for owners of 
natural resources to engage in conservation practices were diminished. Therefore, the 
export taxes risk reducing incentives both for owners and processors to conserve and use 
natural resources efficiently. 15 o Objectives such as conservation of natural resources could be effectively addressed with 
export restrictions if they actually result in a production decrease. However, without 
corresponding measures to restrain domestic consumption, an export restriction does not 
always lead to a decrease in production (OECD, 2009b). 16 In this regard, regulation on 
production itself, rather than on trade, is an alternative option considering that market instrument permitted by WTO rules and was equivalent to taxes on imports or the tariff escalation applied by 
the majority of importing countries to stop entry of processed products. 12. 
According to the TPR report on Angola, the authorities indicated that export duties were levied for the purpose 
of environmental protection, particularly of flora and fauna. 13. 
This policy consideration is reflected in Article XX(g) of GATT 1994 which allows exceptional quantitative 
restrictions if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or 
consumption. 14.

Although China applied export restrictions on molybdenum for conservation purposes, the production of 
molybdenum in China has risen continuously, making the measure ineffective in fulfilling the stated policy 
objective. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 11 imperfections arise in the production stage regardless of the domestic or international 
destination of the products. 17 @BULLET 
Controlling inflationary pressures and securing domestic supply (especially regarding agricultural 
products for food security). o An increase in the international price of a commodity may create inflationary pressures. 
Several governments rely on export restrictions as a policy tool to keep inflation under 
control and thus maintain stable price for basic products. An export restriction, by 
increasing domestic supply, reduces the domestic price of the product, thus partially 
offsetting the inflationary pressures coming from higher prices abroad. 18 However, such 
measures when applied by large countries that can influence world prices can have a 
negative impact on the welfare of trading partners, especially those of small countries, by 
reducing the supply to the world market and thus amplifying the negative aspects of the 
initial high price (OECD, 2009c). o Several governments responded to high food prices in 2007/08 with more trade-friendly 
policy options. One of the most common policy responses has been to reduce or suspend 
import tariffs on food products. Another response has been targeted cash transfers to 
vulnerable groups. (FAO, 2008 and OECD, 2009a) @BULLET 
Other objectives: improving terms-of-trade and counteracting tariff escalation. o An export tax on a particular commodity can improve the country's terms-of-trade — the 
relative price of a country's exports compared to its imports — when applied by a large 
country that has market power. Such a measure increases the world price of the 
commodity, thus allowing the country to import more for each unit of the exported 
commodity. o Many developing countries, which represent a small fraction of world exports in a 
particular commodity, do not possess such market power. This objective can be achieved 
under the assumption that other countries do not retaliate by raising tariffs themselves 
(Piermartini, 2004). Considering the difficulty of calculating optimal tax rates, there is also 
a risk that application of too high rates will lead to a large welfare loss of the exporting 
country (Piermartini, 2004 and OECD, 2009c). o Export restrictions can also be used to counteract tariff escalation by importing countries. 
Tariff escalation is the practice of charging higher import tariffs on processed goods than 
on unprocessed ones. The use of export taxes was suggested by several countries as a 
policy choice to reduce the impact of tariff escalation on their exports of processed 
products. 17. 
As the world's leading producer and supplier of copper, Chile responded to resource depletion by applying a 
mining tax on the operating income of mine operators rather than relying on export restrictions. (OECD, 
2009c) 18. 
For example, in Argentina, MEP Resolution No. 114 of 8 March 2006 suspended exports of bovine livestock, 
of the hoof, and of certain cuts and preparations and preserves of bovine meat for a period of 180 days. The 
government justified this measure as necessary to maintain the stability of beef prices in the face of price 
increases caused by external demand. Kazakhstan applied a temporary ban on wheat export in 2008 for the 
same reason. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 12 o A study of tariff data suggests that the degree of escalation differs greatly across countries 
and the tariff escalation found in some developing countries is more prominent than in 
developed countries (Piermartini, 2004). Furthermore, to be an effective countermeasure, 
the application of export taxes should focus on countries with the most significant level of 
tariff escalation. However, in most cases identical duty rates are applied among importing 
countries, therefore making the effectiveness of this approach doubtful. 15. 
Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives 
indicated above, not all governments rely on these measures but use instead alternative policy options with 
different trade impacts. This leads to the question of whether export restrictions are the most effective 
option in achieving policy objectives and whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least trade 
distorting ways compared with alternative options. 16. 
Normally, export duties are applied on a limited number of products. However, in some 
countries, export duties are applied generally covering all products. Especially among the LDCs, a general 
export tax is more widely used as evidenced in Bangladesh, Chad, Gambia, and Niger for example. When 
generally used, the rates tend to be in the low range. For example, both Bangladesh and Pakistan applied a 
general export tax of 0.25%, and Cameroon applied a general 2% export tax. In several countries, actual 
tax rates are lower than statutory rates, and administrative bodies can raise applied rates under the ceiling 
rates without the legislative body's approval or consent. 19 This creates an element of uncertainty. 17. 
Export duties, export quotas, and other forms of restrictions can be applied simultaneously so that 
the overall assessment of measures is necessary to understand their total implications. For example, in 
2005 China removed an 8% VAT rebate for exports of primary aluminium and, in addition, imposed a 5% 
interim export tax. Reducing VAT rebate rates has the same effect as export duties in that they raise the 
cost of exports, resulting in reduced exports volume. One interesting point regarding reduction of VAT is 
that such measures are aimed at curbing exports while VAT rebate schemes for exports normally work as 
export stimulus. 18. 
Minimum export prices are applied either to achieve target export prices which are set to control 
world market prices or to facilitate customs procedure – preventing under-invoicing. According to TPR 
reports, the minimum export prices applied in the Philippines for rice and corn could have similar 
economic effects as export taxes. In Brazil, however, a minimum export price was not used except as a 
base to calculate export taxes. It is not clear, in some cases, whether minimum export prices are binding in 
nature or just reference prices. 19. 
Export restrictions of one country may induce similar measures from other exporting countries. 
Once an export restriction is applied, it is likely that importing countries will shift their source of imports 
to other countries (Dollive, 2008). The other exporting countries may then be forced to apply similar 
measures in order to meet domestic demand by limiting their exports. 20 For example, according to 19. 
For example, Pakistan can impose regulatory duties up to 100% on exports without parliamentary approval. 
Egypt, although it does not currently impose export duties, can apply export tax up to 100% at any time 
according to the relevant regulation. In Thailand, the persistence of relatively high statutory export taxes 
leaves an element of uncertainty, as export taxes on important products, such as rice or rubber which are 
subject to 0% export tax, could in principle be reintroduced up to the level of statutory rates (10% for rice, 
40% for rubber) without legislative approval. 20. 
A similar case can be also found in Ukraine. Ukraine applied wheat export restraints throughout 2007 in an 
attempt to combat the impact of their drought and to keep local bread prices low. As a result, wheat export 
from Ukraine decreased from 4 669.01 MT in 2006 to 1 056.65 MT in 2007. Exports of wheat from Russia 
and Kazakhstan grew significantly in 2007, by 47.9% and 53.4% respectively. Although many factors may 
have contributed to this export growth, export restraints in countries like Ukraine may have contributed to this TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 13 Paraguayan authorities, the main reason cited for their application of export taxes on hides and soybeans is 
the lack of raw materials for the domestic processing industry and the increase in exports of unprocessed 
products, taking into account the distortion created in subregional trade by the taxes on hide exports 
applied by Argentina and Uruguay. 21 This interaction can lead, in principle, to a situation of competitive 
policy practices – and of increasingly higher export taxes (OECD, 2009b). 20. 
The lack of predictability is a concern for several WTO Members. In the 2007 TPR process of 
Argentina, some Members expressed concern that although export duties were applied in 2002 on a 
temporary basis under Resolution No.11/2002, neither the resolution itself nor its complementary or 
amendatory regulations have contained any timetable for the phasing out of these duties. 21. 
The WTO accession process can contribute to the discipline on export duties, but results vary 
across countries. At the time of its WTO accession in 1996, Bulgaria applied a range of export taxes for the 
purpose of preventing or relieving critical shortages of foodstuffs and other essential products. However, it 
undertook commitments to minimize such measures upon accession, and the TPR paper in 2003 provided 
that Bulgaria no longer imposed any duties on exported products. During the accession negotiations, China 
committed not to apply export duties other than on 84 items listed in its Annex. 22 According to the TPR 
report in 2007, China applied statutory export duties on 88 items. In addition, China applied interim export 
duties on 174 products, 64 of which were also subject to statutory export duties. In January 2008, the 
coverage of interim export duties increased to 334 lines at the HS 8-digit level. Considering this binding 
commitment, a question arose regarding the consistency of the interim export duties with WTO disciplines. 
China replied that like other WTO members, China had the right to invoke Article XX of GATT 1994 to 
implement necessary export restriction measures on exhaustible natural resources, and its measures were 
based on this clause. D. 
Economic implications 22. 
Export duties raise the cost of exported products, resulting in decreased export volumes. Reduced 
exports may divert some supply to the domestic market, leading to a downward pressure on domestic 
prices. Through this supply-side effect on international and domestic markets, export duties can create a 
differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors. 
This differential can provide an advantage to domestic downstream processors vis-à-vis foreign processors. 
In this sense, an export duty acts as an implicit subsidy for the domestic processing industries, providing 
them with an artificial competitive advantage. The economic implications vary according to the extent to 
which the exporting country can affect the world market price of the taxed product. A supplier with a large 
world market share will induce a stronger effect on world markets than will a small supplier. Quantitative 
restrictions, by reducing the quantity of exports, induce similar effects as export duties. shift in market share. By 2008, Russia and Kazakhstan also implemented export restrictions. In late January 
2008, Russia announced that it would levy a 40% export duty on wheat for exports bound outside of its 
customs union. In February, Russia tightened the export restrictions, extending the export duties to its customs 
union. Kazakhstan followed by levying export duties on wheat in March. It banned wheat export from 15 April 
2008 until 1 September 2008. Ukraine export restrictions not only forced importing countries to look 
elsewhere, but also may have contributed to the decision by other exporting countries to apply similar 
measures, further limiting the international supply of the commodity. See Dollive, Kendall (2008) The Impact 
of Export Restrictions on Rising Grain Prices, USITC, www.usitc.gov and OECD (2009) Agricultural Policies 
in Emerging Economies 2009: Monitoring and Evaluation. 21. 
See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Paraguay (WT/TPR/S/146) 22. 
See Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China (WT/ACC/CHN/49) TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 14 23. 
Export restrictions result in an efficiency loss in both the exporting and the importing country. 
Consumption distortions result from the fact that too much of the taxed product is consumed domestically, 
while foreign consumers consume too little. Production distortions result from the fact that too much is 
produced in the exporting country's downstream industry, while too little is produced in the importing 
country's downstream industry. This production efficiency loss is sometimes justified by the  " infant 
industry "  argument, i.e. to provide an incentive for the development of a higher value-added industry. It is 
not clear whether this infant industry strategy leads to successful results. 23 24. 
Export restrictions can also affect long-term investment and production response. For example, 
when international food prices are high, one observed policy response is to ensure household food security 
by lowering domestic food prices. Although there are other methods for this purpose, such as reducing 
tariffs, some food exporting countries have chosen to reduce domestic prices by applying export duties on 
agricultural products. However, imposition of export duties reduces incentives for the suppliers to increase 
their production and investment, which will decrease long-term supply, thereby aggravating international 
price increases. The long-term solution to high international prices would be to increase the international 
supply of the products (World Bank, 2008 and OECD, 2008). Price volatility and unstable supplies caused 
by export restrictions create an insecure business environment. This is important regarding the mining 
industry where investments are long-term and require large amounts of capital. The uncertainty, by 
delaying investment in this industry, can have a negative impact on the supply of raw materials. IV. 
Current disciplines in the WTO A. 
Substantive regulations: uneven discipline between export duties and quantitative restrictions 25. 
There is no single GATT/WTO article dealing exclusively with export restrictions. Still, 
Article XI of the GATT 1994 is the key provision regarding export restrictions. It prohibits the use of 
quantitative restrictions regarding both imports and exports. It states that  " no prohibitions or restrictions 
other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licences 
or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party (on the importation of any 
product destined for the territory of any other contracting party or) on the exportation or sale for export of 
any product for the territory of any other contracting party. "  Therefore, export duties are in principle not 
subject to Article XI and thus not prohibited under this article, while quantitative restrictions are. 26. 
Regarding quantitative restrictions which are generally prohibited, the issue is whether these 
measures can be exceptionally allowed under Article XI:2 (a) (critical shortage of foodstuffs), Article XX 
(General Exceptions) and Article XXI (Security Exceptions). Article XI:2(a) allows each Member to apply 
export restrictions  " temporarily "  to prevent or relieve  " critical "  shortage of foodstuffs or other products 
essential to the exporting country. Article 12 of the Agreement on Agriculture (disciplines on export 
prohibition and restriction) stipulates in detail when quantitative restrictions on exports are exceptionally 
allowed. 24 Article XX allows exceptional quantitative restrictions for policy objectives such as 23. 
For example, in Cameroon, to encourage value added and ensure the supply of local wood for processing 
industries, the entire log production must be processed on site, and for many species log exports are prohibited 
since 2004. For the others, exports require a prior permit from the National Forestry Development Office 
(ONADEF). Also, exports are subject to a tax of 17.5% of the f.o.b. value of log (unprocessed wood), and a 
tax of 2% on other products. However, according to the authorities, the loss brought about by prohibiting 
exports of most logs has not been offset by an increase of processed timber. 24. 
It requires members introducing new export restrictions on foodstuffs in accordance with Article XI:2(a) of 
GATT 1994 to give due consideration to the effects of such restrictions on the importing member's food 
security. Members, except non-net exporting developing countries, must notify the Committee on Agriculture 
before introducing new export restrictions on foodstuffs, and must consult with affected members. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 15 conservation of exhaustible natural resources, and ensuring essential materials for domestic processing 
industry under  " certain qualifications. "  25 However, the article also makes it clear that the exception should 
not be abused for protection purposes. 26 Article XXI exception applies to measures for the purpose of 
international safety. 27 27. 
Article II:1 (b) of the GATT 1994 prohibits all import duties other than ordinary customs duties 
on products bound in Schedules of Concessions. 28 In contrast, no provisions specifically require a binding 
obligation of export duties like import duties. Still, the MFN principle explicitly applies to export duties in 
Article I of the GATT 1994 and relevance of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing 
measures was invoked under the WTO dispute setttlement scheme. 29 28. 
As is evidenced in WTO dispute cases 30 and in WTO TPR reports, export duties and quantitative 
restrictions are just different forms of export restrictions, and in this sense are substitutes or supplements to 
each other. It is also clear that prohibitively high export duties will induce the same effect as export 25. 
For example, (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measure are made 
effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption; (i) involving restrictions on 
exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic 
processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as 
part of a governmental stabilization plan; Provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the 
exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of this 
Agreement relating to non-discrimination; (j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general 
or local short supply; Provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all contracting 
parties are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such 
measures, which are inconsistent with the other provisions of the Agreement shall be discontinued as soon as 
the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist… 26. 
The introductory paragraph (Chapeau) of Article XX provides that exception is allowed  " subject to the 
requirement that measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or 
unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on 
international trade. "  27. 
For example, (b)(ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in 
other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military 
establishment; (c) any action in pursuance of its obligation under the United Nations Charter for the 
maintenance of international peace and security. 28. 
The products described in Part I of the Schedule relating to any contracting party, which are the products of 
territories of other contracting parties, shall, on their importation into the territory to which the Schedule 
relates, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from 
ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth and provided therein. Such products shall also be exempt 
from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation in excess of 
those imposed on the date of this Agreement or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed 
thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that date. 29. 
See WTO panel report on measures treating export restraints as subsidies (WT/DS194/R). Herbert Smith 
(2009) even discusses the possibility of applying the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement (ADA). Dumping occurs 
when the export price of a product is less than its normal value. Although normal value is usually the domestic 
price in the exporting country, the ADA allows members to construct normal value when domestic price does 
not represent normal value. If processed products are benefiting from a raw material price advantage caused by 
export restrictions, it may be possible to construct normal value reflecting this market condition. 30. 
In two dispute cases, the agreed solution was to transform quantitative restrictions to export duties. The 
solution after the EC-Pakistan dispute on Pakistan's export prohibition on hides and skins resulted in the 
replacement of prohibition by a 20% export duty. When disputed by EC, India also removed export restrictions 
on hides/skins and leather and introduced export duties on these products. In both cases, the parties to the 
dispute reached an agreement without establishment of panel. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 16 prohibitions. However, under the current WTO scheme, quantitative restrictions on exports are in principle 
prohibited while export duties are allowed, and will lead to more frequent use of export duties than 
quantitative restrictions. Export duties will increase government revenue, which is especially important to 
LDCs; in addition, tax schemes are more transparent and less subject to discretion than are quantitative 
restrictions. However, lack of substantive regulations on export duties means there is no multilateral 
agreement to prevent the abuse of export duties. B. 
Transparency and notification 29. 
Article X of the GATT 1994 requires a Member to: 1) publish its trade-related laws, regulations, 
rulings and agreements in prompt and accessible manner; 2) abstain from enforcing measures of general 
application prior to their publication; and 3) administer the above mentioned laws, regulations, rulings and 
agreements in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner. The paramount objective of this article is 
transparency. Export restrictions are subject to this article considering its regulatory nature and effects on 
trade. Therefore, the general rule of transparency applies to both export duties and quantitative restrictions 
but no more than that; no obligation of notification under this article. 30. 
The Decisions at Marrakesh include a Notification Procedure that has an indicative list of 
notifiable measures. This list includes: quantitative restrictions, other non-tariff measures such as licensing; 
export taxes, and export restrictions, including voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing 
arrangements. 31 However, a note to this indicative list states that it does not alter existing notification 
requirements in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and the Plurilateral Trade Agreements of the WTO. In 
this sense, the initiative proposed by the United States, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei regarding export 
licensing is one example of efforts undertaken to enhance transparency regarding export restrictions. 31. 
After the Uruguay Round, a decision by the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) in 1995 created 
procedures on biennial notification of quantitative restrictions. 32 The format of the notification does not 
include export duties or taxes, seeming to reflect current disciplines on Article XI and relevant provisions 
which exclude export duties from the application. The other decision by the CTG in 1995 established so 
called reverse notification procedures to allow Members to indicate specific non tariff measures of other 
Members for transparency purpose, but this process has rarely been used by Members. 33 Therefore, no 
decisions specifically entail a notification obligation of export duties. 31. 
Notifiable measures; Tariffs (including range and scope of bindings, GSP provisions, rates applied to members 
of free-trade areas/customs unions, other preferences), tariff quotas and surcharges, Quantitative restrictions, 
including voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing arrangements affecting imports, Other non-tariff 
measures such as licensing and mixing requirements; variable levies, Custom valuation, Rules of origin, 
government procurement, technical barriers, safeguard actions, anti-dumping actions, Countervailing actions, 
Export taxes, Export subsidies, tax exemptions and concessionary export financing, Free-trade zones, 
including in-bond manufacturing, Export restrictions, including voluntary export restraints and orderly 
marketing arrangements, Other government assistance, including subsidies, tax exemptions, Role of state-
trading enterprise, Foreign exchange controls related to imports and exports, Government-mandated 
countertrade, Any other measure covered by the Multilateral Trade Agreements in ANNEX 1A to the WTO 
Agreement (Ministerial Decision on Notification Procedures adopted by the Trade Negotiating Committee on 
15 December 1993). 32

31 January 1996 and at two-yearly intervals thereafter… "  33 
G/L/60 Decision on Reverse Notification of Non-Tariff Measures. Only two reverse notifications for this 
purpose have been found in the WTO documents. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 17 32. 
In summary, explicit disciplines on export duties are very limited except the MFN principle 
under Article I of GATT 1994 and the general transparency requirement (e.g. publication of regulations) 
under the Article X of the GATT 1994. No country engages in the scheduling and notification of export 
duties, in contrast to the strict scheduling of import duties. C. 
WTO Accession 33. 
Since the creation of WTO, the accession process has provided certain disciplines on export 
restrictions thus complementing GATT 1994, 34 especially regarding export duties for several countries 
(Table 3). Regarding export duties, although there is no binding schedule for the existing Members, many 
new Members committed to bind their export duty rates. Notably in the case of China, 84 specific items 
have been scheduled, with the commitment to eliminate all export duties except on these items. The 
schedule indicates the rate of bound export duties. Export restrictions were also one of the topics in the 
discussion on Russia's accession. 35 34. 
The necessity and efforts to provide more discipline on export restrictions were not always shared 
among WTO members. During Ukraine's accession negotiation, some Members stated that Ukraine's 
export duties were very high, with a strong trade-distorting impact, and in some cases too prohibitive for 
trade. A Member noted that Ukraine appeared to apply trade-related investment measures (TRIM) by 
granting an exemption from export duties to agricultural producers, contingent on the production of certain 
agricultural commodities. In contrast, some developing country Members had a positive view of export 
duties as a development instrument. Other Members noted that the imposition of export duties was not 
inconsistent with WTO rules. 36 34 
Paragraph 1.2 of Part I of the Accession Protocol makes it clear that the Protocol, including the commitments 
referred in the Working Party Report, shall be an integral part of the WTO Agreement. 35 
In the accession process of Russia, export duties on minerals, petrochemicals, natural gas, raw hides and skins, 
ferrous and non-ferrous metals and scraps, etc., were discussed. WTO Members argued that in case where 
Russia is the dominant supplier, third country buyers would suffer from increased costs because of the high 
price of the product and would encounter insufficient supplies of the goods. They pointed out that the loss of 
relative competitiveness in the global market for downstream products vis-à-vis Russian products should be 
taken into account. Wheat (40%), log (25%), palladium/rhenium/titanium (6.5%), copper (10%) are several 
examples of products subject to export tax since 2008. 36. 
See Ukraine Accession document WT/ACC/UKR/152. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 18 Table 3. Examples of disciplines undertaken at the time of WTO accessions (since 2001) China 
(2001) China shall eliminate all taxes and charges applied to exports unless specifically provided for in 
Annex 6 of this Protocol or applied in conformity with the provisions of Article VIII of the GATT 1994. 
(section 11.3. of protocol) (Annex 6 indicates 84 products and rate of export duties.(ANNEX 2)) The representative of China confirmed that China would abide by WTO rules in respect of non-
automatic export licensing and export restrictions. The Foreign Trade Law would also be brought into 
conformity with GATT requirements. Moreover, export restrictions and licensing would only be applied, 
after the date of accession, in those cases where this was justified by GATT provisions. The Working 
Party took note of these commitments. Armenia 
(2003) The representative of Armenia confirmed that any export licensing requirements or other export control 
requirements would be applied in conformity with WTO provisions including those contained in Articles 
XI, XVII, XX and XXI of the GATT 1994. The Working Party took note of this commitment. Cambodia 
(2004) The representative of Cambodia said that Cambodia levied export taxes on certain unprocessed raw 
materials and products to encourage local processing, encourage exports of finished products and to 
protect human health. The representative of Cambodia stated that, from the date of accession, Cambodia would ensure that it 
applied its laws and regulations governing export measures and would act in conformity with the 
relevant provisions of the WTO, including Articles I and XI of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The Working Party took note of this commitment. Vietnam 
(2007) The representative of Vietnam confirmed that with regard to export duties on ferrous and non-ferrous 
scrap metals (35, 45%), Vietnam would reduce export duties in accordance with its commitment on 
export duties (Table 17 in Annex 2). The representative of Vietnam confirmed that, upon accession, any remaining export restrictions and 
management measures would be applied in a manner fully consistent with WTO provisions. The 
Working Party took note of this commitment. Ukraine 
(2008) The representative of Ukraine confirmed that Ukraine would reduce export duties in accordance with 
the binding schedule, and that as regarding these products, Ukraine would not increase export duties, 
nor apply other measures having an equivalent effect, unless justified under the exceptions of the 
GATT 1994. The representative also confirmed that from the date of accession, Ukraine will not apply 
any obligatory minimum export prices. The representative of Ukraine confirmed that from the date of accession, the export licensing 
requirements and other export restrictions and control requirements listed or any introduced in the 
future would be applied in conformity with WTO provisions, including those contained in Articles XI, 
XVII, XX and XXI of the GATT 1994. The export ban on nonferrous scrap metal would be eliminated 
and Ukraine would remove current export restrictions on grains and precious metals and stones other 
than gold, silver, and diamonds, as from the date of accession. The Working Party took note of this 
commitment. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 19 V. 
Evolving disciplines in bilateral/multilateral levels A. 
Regional and bilateral disciplines 35. 
Regional trade agreements (RTAs) include, to a varying degree, disciplines on export restrictions. 
Several regional trade agreements, in contrast to the WTO, include disciplines on export duties. For 
example, NAFTA, EU-Mexico, Australia-New Zealand (ANZCER), and Japan-Singapore (JSEPA) 
agreements in principle prohibit export duties. The growing tendency in Europe and in the Western 
Hemisphere to restrict export duties has been well recognised in both a bilateral context and in regional 
trade agreements. 36. 
In the EU, Article 25 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that custom 
duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member 
States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. Article 29 provides that 
quantitative restrictions on exports, and all measures having equivalent effect, shall be prohibited between 
Member States. Although there are exceptions to this general prohibition on quantitative restrictions, these 
exceptions do not apply to export duties. 37 37. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is also stringent regarding export 
restrictions. Article 314 of the NAFTA imposes a prohibition on export taxes, subject to a Mexican 
exception for basic foods set out in Annex 314. Regarding quantitative restrictions, it provides general 
rules in line with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 315 further specifies the conditions of exceptions 
in Articles XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT 1994 by articulating detailed requirements such as 
comparison of trade volumes. 38 Overall, these provisions help to enhance transparency and narrow the 
scope of unpredictability by articulating regulations in annexes and detailed requirements in the provisions. 38. 
In Article 2.8 of the US-Morocco FTA agreement, the Parties undertook not to adopt or maintain 
any prohibition or restriction on the export of any good to the other Party, except as provided in the 
Agreement and in accordance with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 2.10 provides that except as 
provided in Annex 2-C, neither Party may adopt or maintain any tax, duty, or other charge on the export of 
any good to the territory of the other Party, unless the tax, duty, or charge is also adopted or maintained on 
the good when destined for domestic consumption. 39 37. 
Article 30 provides that Article 29 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods 
in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and 
life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or 
archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions 
shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between 
Member States. 38. 
Article 315 (Mexico is exempted by Annex 315) provides that a Party may adopt or maintain a restriction 
otherwise justified under Article XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT with respect to the export of the 
Party to the territory of another Party, only if: (a) the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the total 
export shipments of the specific good made available to that other Party relative to the total supply of that 
good of the Party maintaining the restrictions as compared to the proportion prevailing in the most recent 36-
month period. 39. 
Annex 2-C stipulates that Article 2.10 shall not apply to a tax on exports of processed or unprocessed 
phosphates, provided that the tax rate is no higher than 34 dirhams per ton of unprocessed phosphates, for five 
years beginning on the date of entry into force of this agreement. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 20 39. 
Other RTAs include disciplines similar to those under the WTO. For example, Article 2.5 of the 
India-Singapore FTA agreement provides that neither Party may adopt or maintain any non-tariff measures 
on the export of any goods to the other party except in accordance with its WTO rights and obligations or 
in accordance with other provisions of the agreement. The Australia-Thailand RTA stipulates that the 
Parties are not allowed to adopt or maintain any prohibition or restriction on the export or sale for export of 
any good, except in accordance with Article XI of the GATT, but this does not deal with export duties. 40 
Some RTAs do not include any discipline at all. In either China-Chile or China-Pakistan RTAs, there is no 
provision on export duties. China, in its question and response paper regarding its RTA with Chile, made it 
clear that it did not have any clause regarding export duties in its FTAs with other countries. 41 40. 
The fewer countries involved in negotiations, the easier to compromise and reach a conclusion, 
and hence several RTAs were relatively more successful in disciplining export restrictions than the 
multilateral forum of the WTO. However, it should be also noted that bilateral negotiations were not very 
successful in restraining export restrictions of countries which were major users of such measures. 42 B. 
Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Negotiations B1. 
Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) Negotiations 41. 
Since the creation of the Negotiating Group on Market Access for Non-Agricultural Products in 
the context of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), countries have communicated their thoughts about 
the scope and modalities of the future negotiations, inter alia in the non-tariff field. Export duties have 
been mentioned several times. Included in its draft modalities is a textual proposal from the EU on export 
taxes. 43 In that proposal, the EU provided the following reasons as to why export taxes pose serious 
difficulties for trade liberalization: 1) export taxes can have serious distortive effects on global commodity 
trade especially when applied by major suppliers; 2) when used for industrial or trade policy purposes, 
export taxes can serve as indirect subsidization of processing industries and influence international trading 
conditions of these goods; and 3) export taxes can serve to displace imports on the market of the country 
imposing the taxes, both for imported goods in direct competition with the taxed products and for imported 
processed products. Among the reasons for the growing importance of export taxes today are inter alia: the 
recent proliferation in the use of these instruments, which is possible under the weaker WTO rules on 
export taxes compared to those on import restrictions or other forms of NTMs; and the shortfall of global 
supply of some specific commodities, despite their abundance in a few countries – a situation that is 
aggravated by export taxes in key supplying countries. 44 42. 
The European Union (EU) emphasized that any approach should ensure increased transparency 
and predictability. Concerning transparency, Members should be fully informed of measures taken by any 
other Member that may influence trade. The EU also considered that scheduling and binding of Members' 
export taxes could offer an appropriate route of ensuring adequate predictability. This approach would 40. 
See Factual Presentation regarding Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (WT/REG185/3). 41. 
See Question and replies regarding China-Chile FTA (WT/REG230/2). 42. 
For example, although China is one of major users of export restrictions, there is no effective discipline on 
such measures in six RTAs (including Hong Kong and Macao) it joined. 43. 
See Draft Modalities for Non-agricultural Market Access, Fourth Edition (TN/MA/W/103/Rev.3). 44. 
According to 2006 EC proposal (TN/MA/W11/Add.6), export taxes are used for the purpose of (or otherwise 
having the effect of) (1) artificially transferring gains from trade between WTO Members; (2) creating unfair 
advantages for domestic industries involved in international trade at the expense of other WTO Members' 
producers; or (3) evading existing WTO disciplines on export restrictions by shifting to more or less 
prohibitive taxes on the exportation of goods. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 21 imply that (1) WTO Members should notify the introduction or modification of export taxes and (2) WTO 
Members should undertake to schedule export taxes in their Schedules of Concessions and bind the export 
taxes at a level to be negotiated with exceptions. 45 43. 
Regarding transparency, there was a significant initiative by several countries including the 
United States, Japan and Korea. 46 This initiative concentrates on export licensing which is another form of 
export restrictions. According to this proposal, export licensing is defined as any administrative procedures 
involving the submission of an application or other documentation (other than that required for customs 
purposes) to the relevant administrative body or bodies as a prior condition for exportation. It requires each 
country to notify, in writing, existing measures on export licensing and any new measures on export 
licensing within 60 days after the effective date of the new measures. Each country, upon request by any 
WTO member, is also required to provide all relevant information including, among others, the export 
licenses granted over a recent period and other measures taken in conjunction with export licensing 
regarding restrictions on domestic production or consumption. Finally, according to this proposal, the 
Committee on market access would review at least once every two years the implementation and operation 
of this protocol. B2. 
Agriculture negotiations 44. 
Export restrictions were also discussed during the DDA agriculture negotiations. Most 
participants agreed that some disciplines were needed to ensure stable supplies for importing countries. 
Japan stated that in view of redressing the imbalances of the rights and obligations between importing and 
exporting countries, and of maintaining the food security of food-importing countries, rules and disciplines 
on export-promoting and export-restricting measures should be established. 47 They proposed converting 
export restrictions to taxes that would then be reduced (similar to tariffication of import restrictions). Korea 
proposed that rules and disciplines on export competition should be transparent and contribute to the 
overall balance of rights and obligations between exporting countries and importing countries. In this 
regard, disciplines with the following objectives are needed: (i) to prohibit exporting countries from 
imposing export restrictions and prohibitions arbitrarily; and (ii) to prohibit the use of export tax for the 
purpose of export restrictions. 48 Switzerland stated that disciplines are necessary in order to ensure that 45. 
The exception includes that (a) least-developed countries would undertake to schedule export taxes but may 
maintain these export taxes unbound and (b) paragraph 6 countries (developing country Members with no final 
bound total AMS commitments) would schedule export taxes but may maintain these export taxes unbound for 
a certain number of tariff lines (the number is to be negotiated), in reflection of their specific development 
interests and concerns. 46. 
See Protocol on Transparency in Export Licensing to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 
(TN/MA/W/15/Add.4/Rev.5) which was proposed by Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Ukraine and the United 
States. 47. 
Japan specifically proposed: (1) to tariffy all export prohibitions and restrictions (by replacing them with 
export taxes); (2) to bind all export taxes (including those possibly introduced in the future) (for products 
subject to the export tax, to establish quotas in which a certain amount of exports will be exempt from the 
export tax), and (3) in the case where temporary and short-term measures to restrict exports become necessary 
before export taxes are introduced, to clarify the disciplines applied on such emergency measures used in order 
to adjust the volume of exports. Measures for clarifying such disciplines are (i) to establish strict requirements 
for the application of such emergency measures; (ii) to introduce consultations with other Members as a 
prerequisite for imposing emergency measures, and to clarify the measures to be taken when the consultations 
do not result in a satisfactory solution; (iii) to obligate Members, when introducing emergency measures, to 
maintain the proportion of exports to domestic production at the level of preceding x years, in order to allow 
importing countries to secure the necessary level of imports; and (iv) to limit the duration of such emergency 
measures. (G/AG/NG/W/91) 48. 
See Korea's Proposal for WTO negotiation on Agriculture (G/AG/NG/W/98). TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 22 measures taken for the purpose of achieving social objectives do not harm the interests of other countries, 
and proposed the elimination of all export restrictions on agricultural products and the binding at zero of all 
export tariffs (with a flexibility clause for the LDCs). 49 The United States proposed to prohibit the use of 
export taxes, including differential export taxes, for competitive advantage or supply management 
purposes. 50 The most recent draft modalities for agriculture includes clauses that introduce tightened 
disciplines for new export restrictions with increased transparency and monitoring. 51 45. 
Exporting countries, while agreeing that tighter disciplines would provide Members with more 
stable access to agricultural products, emphasized the interrelation between tariff escalation and export 
restrictions. 52 According to them, tariff escalation hinders the capacity of exporting countries to develop 
processing industries. In particular, it prevents developing countries from adding value to their exports. As 
a response to tariff escalation, some developing countries have taken recourse to restricting or taxing their 
raw material exports. The Cairns Group proposed that the agriculture negotiations should (i) develop both 
improved disciplines on export restrictions and taxes and eliminate tariff escalation; and (ii) preserve 
Article 12.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and provide additional special and differential treatment 
provisions to address the legitimate needs of developing countries, including least developed and net food-
importing developing countries. VI. 
Conclusion and policy implications 46. 
Export restrictions are applied to achieve diverse policy objectives: increasing government 
revenue, stabilizing inflationary pressure, promoting downstream industry, conserving natural resources, 
etc. However, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable. Furthermore, export restrictions may 
result in efficiency losses. Furthermore, export restrictions, by lowering domestic prices, can reduce 
incentives for the suppliers to increase their production and investment, which can aggravate international 
price instability. In this sense, when designing and applying such measures, policy makers should consider 
several factors: (1) whether the measures are effective in achieving policy objectives, (2) whether the 
benefit outweighs the cost of the measures, and (3) whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least 
trade distorting ways. 47. 
Export duties and quantitative restrictions are substitutable policy tools as indicated in TPR 
papers. Considering this nature, uneven discipline under the current WTO scheme may induce more use of 
export duties. More reliance on export duties is, in a sense, consistent with the tariffication scheme of the 
WTO regarding imports restriction. The problem is that unlike imports tariff which is regulated by binding 49. 
See Switzerland's Proposal for WTO negotiation on Agriculture (G/AG/NG/W/94). 50. 
See US Proposal for comprehensive long-term Agricultural Trade Reform (G/AG/NG/W/15). 51. 
See Revised Draft Modalities for Agriculture (TN/AG/W/4/Rev.4). Regarding Article 12 of the Agreement of 
Agriculture, it proposes that the member instituting export prohibitions and restrictions shall consult, upon 
request, with any other member having a substantial interest as an importer and shall report the progress made 
in the consultations to the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee on Agriculture shall provide for annual 
notification update and surveillance of the obligations and any member may bring to the attention of the 
Committee on Agriculture any measures which it considers ought to have been notified by another member. 
Existing export prohibitions and restrictions in foodstuffs and feeds under Article XI.2 (a) of GATT 1994 shall 
be eliminated by the end of the first year of implementation. Any new export prohibitions or restrictions under 
Article XI.2(a) of GATT 1994 should not normally be longer than 12 months, and shall only be longer than 18 
months with the agreement of the affected importing members. These clauses emphasize that export 
restrictions, even when applied for food security, should be applied only temporarily. 52. 
The Cairns Group, which included Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Guatemala, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, 
submitted its proposal paper (G/AG/NG/W/93). TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 23 schedule, export duties are not restrained by any substantive discipline. Lack of discipline may result in 
abuse of export duties. 48. 
The growing number of bilateral and regional trade agreements has introduced disciplines to 
prohibit export duties. In the WTO, accession procedures have provided a multilateral framework for 
making progress with respect to individual countries, as in the case of China. During the DDA negotiations, 
countries have communicated their thoughts on these measures. However, it is questionable whether these 
efforts to introduce multilateral or bilateral discipline have been very successful. 49. 
Although the TPR reports are the most trustworthy source regarding the documentation of export 
restrictions, it is not satisfactory. 53 The review process takes place every two to four years, depending on 
the countries involved and therefore cannot reflect the most up-to-date information. The WTO notification 
procedure is not effective especially regarding export duties, and this partially reflects lack of substantive 
regulation on export duties. Transparency regarding the use and implementation of export restrictions 
should be substantially improved. 53. 
TPR reports do not cover countries that are not member of the WTO and hence additional sources should be 
consulted to have a more complete information covering these countries. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 24 REFERENCES Deese, William and John Reeder (2007) Export Taxes on Agricultural Products: Recent History and

DESCRIPTION OF EXPORT DUTIES/TAXES IN TPR REPORTS Europe / Middle East Bahrain (2007) 
No export taxes. Export fees on ready-made clothes were eliminated in 2005. Bulgaria (2003) 
No export taxes. At the time of its WTO accession in 1996, Bulgaria applied a range of 
export taxes for the purpose of preventing or relieving critical shortage of foodstuffs 
and other essential products. However, it undertook commitments to minimize the use 
of such measures upon accession, and no longer imposes any duties or other 
charges on exported goods. European Union (25) 
(2009, 2007, 2004) No export taxes. Georgia (2009) 
No export taxes. Iceland (OECD) (2006) 
No export taxes. According to Act 66/2002, a fee of ISK 500 should be paid for every 
horse exported into a fund established with the purpose of protecting the species. The 
authorities stressed that this fee is not collected by the Directorate of Customs. Israel (2006) 
No export taxes. Jordan (2008) 
An export tax of JD 30 per tonne is collected by the Customs authorities on exports of 
scrap and waste of iron, brass, and aluminium, to secure the needs of the domestic 
industry. Mining and quarrying products are subject to export fees, which are collected 
by the Natural Resources Authority. In 2006, these fees generated tax revenues of JD 
0.4 million. The Ministry of Agriculture collects fees on exported agricultural products. 
These charges relate to services rendered, such as quarantine, fumigation, and 
inspection. Liechtenstein (2004) 
No export taxes. Norway (OECD) (2008, 
2004) Exporters of fish and fish products are subject to a levy between 0.2% and 1.05% of 
the export value (f.o.b.), depending on the species and stage of processing. The levy 
is used to finance the activities of the Norwegian Seafood Export Council (NSEC) 
which assists in the marketing of fish and fish products. Oman (2008) 
No export taxes. Qatar (2005) 
No export taxes Romania (2005) 
No export taxes. Switzerland (OECD) 
(2008, 2004) No export taxes. Export duties may be levied on goods listed in the "export tariff" 
schedule, to guarantee the national supply (48 tariff lines at the HS eight-digit level). 
Nonetheless, no export duties were applied during 2004-08. Turkey (OECD) (2007, 
2003) Turkey applies export taxes at a rate of USD 0.5 per kg on raw skins (HS 41.01, 
41.02. and 41.03; excluding processed raw skins); and USD 0.04 per kg for unshelled 
hazelnuts, and USD 0.08 per kg for shelled hazelnuts. The taxes finance the Support 
and Price Stabilisation Fund (SPSF). United Arab Emirates 
(2006) An export tax on steel scrap has been levied at the rate of Dh 250 per tonne since 
2003. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 26 Asia / Pacific Australia 
(OECD) (2007) No export taxes. Bangladesh 
(LDC) (2006) A tax at source on all export earnings remains at 0.25%, but no product-specific taxes, charges 
or levies seem to affect exports. Brunei 
Darussalam 
(2008) No export taxes. China 
(2008, 2006) Export taxes are levied at statutory rates in relation to f.o.b. values and on an MFN basis. In 
addition, lower interim rates may be applied on an MFN basis. The Tariff Commission under 
the State Council sets and publishes the statutory rates annually and revises the list of items 
subject to interim duty together with the rates of duty. In 2007, statutory export taxes applied to 
88 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level, including metals, phosphorous, benzene, and eel; 64 of 
these lines were also subject to lower interim export duties. In the same year, interim export 
duties applied to an additional 110 lines at the HS 8-digit level, which were not subject to 
statutory export taxes. They included: some mineral products; iron, copper, nickel, and 
aluminium ores; certain chemical products; as well as iron and steel products. The interim duty 
rates on 142 tariff lines were increased on 1 June 2007, with a view to reducing exports of 
products that are highly energy consuming and polluting, as well as those consuming large 
amounts of raw materials. On 1 January 2008, the coverage of interim export duties increased 
again to include some more steel products; in total, 334 lines (at the HS 8-digit level and 
including 4 "ex-" lines) are now subject to interim export duties. In addition to these products, 
exports of grain, rice, maize, and soybeans are subject to interim export duties, to discourage 
their export. Though the main objective of these export taxes may be to improve the 
environment by reducing exports of products considered to be highly energy consuming or 
polluting, such taxes tend to increase the domestic supply of the products concerned. As a 
consequence, their domestic prices tend to be lower than would otherwise be the case; thus, 
export taxes may implicitly assist domestic downstream processing of the products concerned. Not fully rebating VAT on exports of certain products has a similar outcome. The VAT rebate 
rates are adjusted from time to time to, inter alia, meet industrial development goals, and 
control exports of certain products. For example, in September 2006, rebate rates were 
lowered on, inter alia, some steel products, cements, and some textiles, as well as furniture, 
plastics, and wood products. In July 2007, China eliminated rebates for some 553 items 
regarded as highly energy consuming, highly polluting, and consuming large amount of raw 
materials, and lowered rebate rates for 2 268 lines (HS 8-digit) that the authorities considered 
prone to trade friction; such items included textiles and steel products. In December 2007, 
China removed the VAT rebate on exports of 84 agricultural tariff lines, such as wheat, maize, 
rice, and soybean, with a view to easing inflation. As a consequence, current VAT rebates are: 
17%, 13%, 11%, 9%, and 5%. The authorities state that VAT rebates on exports amounted to 
CNY 487.7 billion in 2006 (CNY 420 billion in 2004), or about 6.3% of total merchandise 
exports. Chinese Taipei 
(2006) No export taxes. Fiji (2009) 
Export taxes of 3% apply to gold, silver, sugar, molasses, and, following the 2009 Budget, 
unprocessed fish and timber to promote domestic value added. The export tax base is the 
f.o.b. value or, if not easily ascertainable or accepted by Customs, an estimated value in 
accordance with legislation. Government policy is to ensure that the export tax and royalty rate 
on any metallic mineral does not exceed 5% f.o.b. Hong Kong, 
China 
(2006, 2003) No export taxes. However, exports of clothing and footwear continue to be subject to a clothing 
industry training levy of HKD 0.30 per every HKD 1 000 exported. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 27 India 
(2007) With the exception of tanned and untanned hides, skins and leathers (except manufactures of 
leather), all other exports otherwise subject to tax have been exempted through notifications. 
The export tax rates for leather range from 10% to 25% of the f.o.b. value of the product. An 
export cess applied to various products including coffee, spices, tobacco and other agricultural 
commodities has been repealed by the Cess Law (Repealing and Amending) Act, 2005 
enacted in 2006. No information was provided on which exports remain subject to cess. Indonesia 
(2007, 2003) In 1998, Indonesia cut export tariffs on 34 commodities and revamped procedures for export 
tax payments. It reduced export taxes by 20% at end 1998 and another 25% at end 2000. They 
covered paper pulp, wood chips, veneer railroad sleepers, rattan, logs, sawn timber and 
natural sand, and the raw materials for producing these products. Export taxes on these goods 
had been as high as 200% for logs but have now fallen to just 10% The export tax on rattan fell 
to 5%. The export tax on crude palm oil, one of Indonesia's largest export products, was cut to 
3% (from 10%) in 2001, and in December 2005 the Minister of Agriculture announced plans to 
reduce the tax further to 1.5%. The rate on crude palm oil by-products (including olein) was cut 
to 1% (from 6-8%) in 2001. In 2005, the Government imposed export tariffs on raw skins 
(25%), white tanned hides (15%) and coal (5%). Japan (OECD) 
(2009, 2007, 
2005) No export taxes. Korea (OECD) 
(2008, 2004) No export taxes. Kyrgyz Republic 
(2006) No export taxes. Macau, China 
(2007) No export taxes. Maldives (LDC) 
(2009, 2003) Fisheries exports are subject to a 5% royalty, based on weight. Malaysia (2006) 
Export duties are generally imposed on main commodities, such as crude petroleum and palm 
oil. Out of 10 580 tariff lines, 512 lines are subject to export duties, the majority being in 15-
20% range. The purpose of Malaysia's export duties is to discourage the export of raw 
materials and to encourage downstream activities in the country. For example, a 5% export 
duty is levied on cockles (molluscs), live cattle, buffaloes, goats, and wild animals and birds. 
The export of wildlife is discouraged for conservation purposes. Export duties are also imposed 
to fund research and development and promotion activities for commodities in downstream and 
upstream industries and to maintain an adequate supply of certain goods in the domestic 
market. Currently export duties are 15% on logs and range from 10% to 30% for crude palm 
oil, based on tonnage. The Government imposes an export levy on selected species of sawn 
timber to ensure an adequate supply for timber-based industries and for research and 
development. With the exception of crude petroleum, which is subject to a flat rate duty of 20%, 
duties on commodities are based on the  " cost plus "  concept: the duty is only imposed on the 
excess over a threshold price that reflects the cost of production. In September 2003, export 
duties were reduced for 41 items and abolished for another 208 items. Mongolia 
(2005) As of January 2004, Mongolia applies export taxes on several products, such as raw 
cashmere, cut timber, scrap metals and worn rails, copper, zinc alloys/brass, aluminium 
unwrought, etc. In so far as such taxes reduce the domestic price of these products, they 
constitute assistance to their domestic processing. Upon accession to the WTO, Mongolia 
made a commitment to eliminate export duty on raw cashmere within ten years of the date of 
accession. With a view to protecting metal-smelting plants, due to the increasing shortage of 
raw metals and a large increase in the world prices of metals since 1997, export taxes on scrap 
metals were raised from Tog 140/kg to Tog 350/kg in May 2004. New Zealand 
(OECD) 
(2009, 2003) No export taxes. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 28 Pakistan 
(2008) Although export taxes are prohibited, the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) can impose 
 " regulatory duties "  up to 100% on exports, by notification without parliamentary approval 
(Customs Act). Duties of 25% were applied to exported ferrous and non-ferrous waste and 
scrap in June 2006 and of 35% on pulses in 2006/07, due to domestic shortages;  " regulatory 
duties "  also apply at 15% on exports of sugar, 30% on leather goods, 20% on hides and skins 
and, from the 2007/08 Budget, 25% on specified metals and articles thereof. The authorities 
indicate that such measures are used to control supply of commodities for local consumption 
and not to raise revenue or assist domestic users of these goods; nevertheless export taxes 
can implicitly subsidize users of affected goods by reducing domestic prices. The All-Pakistan 
Textile Association no longer sets minimum export prices on cotton yarn. According to the 
authorities the special mechanism mentioned in the 2006 Export Trade Order for monitoring 
metal exports, including prices, was not established. An export development charge of 0.25% 
of the f.o.b. value is levied on all exports (except from export processing zones) to finance the 
Export Development Fund. Philippines 
(2005) Only plantation (non-native) logs are subject to an export tax (20% of f.o.b.). However, 
provisions still appear to exist that enable export taxes to be re-imposed on other products, 
although the authorities indicate that these may no longer apply. The authorities indicate that 
the export tax on non-native logs is imposed to ensure an adequate, stable and sustainable 
supply of domestic timber. However, export taxes are distorting and implicitly subsidize 
downstream processors by providing logs at below world prices, thereby encouraging domestic 
value added, which may be an inefficient use of resources if reliant on the subsidy. The 
authorities indicate that revenue from the export tax is minimal. Minimum export prices seem to 
apply for rice and corn; according to the authorities, they are generally based on world prices. 
Minimum export prices could have similar economic effects to export taxes. Singapore 
(2008, 2004) No export taxes. Solomon Islands 
(LDC) (2009) Export taxes are levied mainly on fish, minerals, and timber. Taxes on timber and fish are 
levied on a value determined by the authorities. Between 2003 and 2007, export duties 
represented almost 18% of total customs and inland revenue. Sri Lanka 
(2004) Export cesses are currently imposed on, inter alia, tea, coconut products, unshelled raw 
cashew, raw hides and skins. It would appear that these cesses are earmarked to finance 
specific activities such as financing R&D in the tea sector and supporting small-scale growers. 
Exports of silica quartz are still subject to a minimum price of USD 300 per tonne. Exports of 
sawn rubber wood are also subject to a minimum export price to prevent the indiscriminate 
felling of rubber trees, and thereby protect the rubber industry. As in the case of imports, 
several types of border charges are levied on certain exports. While these charges may be 
justified by the authorities on grounds of national security, environmental protection, financing 
export promotion, and encouraging downstream processing, the use of such levies on the 
export of locally produced materials is in effect, an input subsidy to processors. Insofar as 
export sales of such materials are diverted onto the home market, the domestic prices of these 
materials are reduced by the export restriction. While processors benefit from lower domestic 
prices, domestic suppliers of materials are penalized. Encouraging production and exports of 
processed products through export levies on inputs, risks developing inefficient industries. 
Export duties and cesses may be imposed to: ensure the availability of raw materials for 
higher-value-added industries and to promote further processing of local materials; finance 
export promotion activities; and protect national security, archaeological items, and the 
environment. Thailand (2007, 
2003) There has been no change in Thailand's export duties since 2003. Export taxes consist of 
statutory rates and applied rates; applied rates involve specific (hides of bovine animals) and 
ad valorem (wood sawn and articles thereof, from zero to 40%) duties. The contribution of 
export taxes to government revenue remains negligible (0.3% of total tax revenue in 2005/06). 
The persistence of relatively high statutory export taxes, nevertheless, leaves an element of 
uncertainty in Thailand's trade regime, as export taxes on important products, such as rice or 
rubber, could in principle be reintroduced up to the level of the statutory rates without 
legislative approval. According to the authorities, the collection of export taxes is primarily for 
the purpose of conserving the environment, although it also constitutes a form of assistance to 
downstream processing. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 29 Africa Angola (LDC) 
(2006) Export duties are levied on: ivory, powder and scrap (10%); raw hides and skins (20%); tanned 
hides and skins (20%); and worked ivory, bone, etc., (10%). The authorities indicate that these 
duties are levied for purposes of environmental protection, particularly of flora and fauna. Benin (LDC) 
(2004) Although export duties were abolished in 1993, a fiscal tax on the export of cocoa beans, crude 
petroleum and precious metals still seems to apply. Botswana (2009, 
2003) The Cattle Export and Slaughter Levy Act 10 of 2005 provides for the imposition of a levy per 
head of cattle exported from Botswana. The levy rate is currently P 10 per animal. Burkina Faso 
(LDC) (2004) Burkina Faso imposes a levy of CFAF 500 (USD 0.83) for each export certificate for works of 
art, which goes to the National Cultural Promotion Fund (FNPC). A special livestock sector 
contribution is levied on the export of live animals. Burundi (LDC) 
(2003) Most products are subject to a 5% export tax on the sales price plus packing costs. Higher 
rates are applied to certain primary commodities: 15% on fresh vegetables, flour, cereals and 
grains; and 6% on tea. Green coffee beans are subject to the 31% rate, but the tax has not 
been collected since 1999. Raw hides and skins, leather, fur skins and articles thereof are 
taxed at 3% and mineral ores at 1%. The government plans to eliminate export taxes and 
charges from 1 January 2003. Cameroon 
(2007) The CAEMC (Central African Economy and Monetary Community) customs regime allows 
member countries to levy export taxes. Cameroon applies export taxes of 2% of the f.o.b. value 
of exported goods, with the exception of logs, which are subject to a higher rate. Exports of 
wood (raw or semi-processed logs) are subject to an export tax of 17.5% of the f.o.b. value. 
Export taxes on logs have been imposed to encourage processing and hence local added 
value. Exports worth CFAF 500 000 or more are subject to the inspection and control tax. 
Exports of fish and meat are subject to a sanitary inspection tax at the same rate as imports. Central African 
Republic (LDC) 
(2007) Gold, diamonds, wood, cattle and live wild animals are the subject of special regime as regards 
export duties and taxes. Chad (LDC) 
(2007) A statistical tax on exports (RSE) is levied at the rate of 2% of the export value, on all tariff 
lines whatever the destination of the goods. The Community preferential tax (TPC) of 0.4% is 
also collected, on behalf of the CAEMC (Central African Economic and Monetary Community), 
on all exports. Export duty is levied on certain, mainly agricultural and fish-breeding, products 
to finance the export  " Rural Intervention Fund "  (FRE). Congo (LDC) 
(2006) Merchandise exports are subject to several export duties and taxes, in particular: the 2% 
automation fee; the 2% supplementary exit duty, from which certain products are exempt; and 
the 2% levy on rough diamonds. Timber is taxed as follows: 1% levy for the public service 
responsible for controlling forest product exports, the tax on timber exports assessed on the 
basis of transport costs, the f.o.b. value, the species and the degree of processing. In addition, 
there is a 15% surcharge on rough timber exported over and above the quota of 85% of the 
production of each forestry enterprise, as well as the contribution to the road fund assessed on 
timber for export or in transit. Djibouti (LDC) 
(2006) Djibouti levies an export tax of DF 500/tonne on salt. Egypt 
(2005) No export taxes. However, according to Article 8 of the Import and Export Regulations, a duty 
up to 100% of the value of the good may be imposed at any time by the Minister responsible 
for trade; according to the authorities, this duty has never been imposed. Gambia (LDC) 
(2004) A 10% export duty is levied on all items, except diamonds, which are taxed at 3%; exports of 
fish, fish products, groundnuts and their by-products, and all exports to the European Union are 
exempted. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 30 Ghana 
(2008) Export taxes are applied on cocoa and hydrocarbons. The rates on hydrocarbons are 
USD 0.09 per litre on aviation turbine kerosene and USD 0.03 per litre on gas oil. The share of 
export taxes in total Government revenue has decreased significantly, from 11.4% in 1998 to 
2.3% in 2005. Guinea (LDC) 
(2005) A fiscal duty (DFE) is applied on the following scale: 0% for all agricultural or industrial 
products harvested or manufactured in the Republic of Guinea; 3% for exports of gold and 
diamonds; 2% for re-exports of goods of foreign origin previously imported against payment of 
duties and taxes in Guinea. The DFE applicable to mining products is determined in the 
various agreements signed with the mining companies. The tax payable by the Guinean 
Bauxite Company (CBG) is USD 8 to 9 per ton of bauxite (it depends on the trend in global 
prices), USD 1.75 per ton of alumina produced by the Alumina Company of Guinea (ACG) and 
USD 0.5 per ton of bauxite used to produce alumina. A tax of USD 13 is payable per ton of 
coffee. Kenya (2006) 
An export tax of 25% applies to hides and skins, and scrap metal. The tax was introduced in 
2004 to encourage local processing. Lesotho (LDC) 
(2009, 2003) Sales tax is levied at 15% on every diamond found in and exported from Lesotho. Madagascar 
(LDC)(2008) According to the authorities, Madagascar does not impose any export taxes. However, some 
products are subject to a charge. Given that these products are almost entirely exported, these 
charges are de facto applicable almost exclusively to exports. Also, a charge is applied to 
fishery products; a charge of 1.5% of the f.o.b. value is applied to worked wood; and a mining 
charge of 2% is applied to mining products. Furthermore, forestry charges are levied on the 
exportation of specimens of fauna and flora: at the rate of 4% of the f.o.b. price for live 
specimens; 2% of the f.o.b. price for processed products; and 1% of the f.o.b. price for 
specimens that have been reproduced. Mali (LDC) 
(2004) Production of gold, which for the most part is exported, is subject to a levy of 3% ad valorem 
under the CPS (export duty). Exports of cotton are also subject to a CPS of 3%. Mauritius (2008) 
No export taxes. Morocco (2009, 
2003) The DH 0.50 tax on every quintal of maize exported was abolished in 2005. The levy of DH 
7/tonne on plant fibre exported was also abolished in 2005. The levy on the exploitation of 
phosphates, amounting to DH 34/tonne of crude phosphate equivalent, payable on exports 
was abolished in January 2008. Mozambique 
(LDC)(2009) Mozambique imposes an export tax of between 18% and 22% of the f.o.b. customs value on 
raw cashews. Although no other specific export tax appears to be applied, certain items, which 
are almost entirely exported, are subject to charges, e.g. cotton, fishery products, forestry 
products, and mining products. For instance, a royalty of Mt 2,000 applies to exports of 
unprocessed precious tropical wood, with a 25% reduction applying if processed. Namibia (2009, 
2003) A 10% tax is imposed on unprocessed diamond exports. Export levies apply to live exports of 
slaughter-ready cattle at N$39.50 per head, and small stock (sheep and goats) at N$7.90 per 
head. Niger (LDC) 
(2009, 2003) A 3% statistical export charge (RSE) applies to all goods except mineral substances, together 
with a special re-export tax (TSR). Tobacco products are subject to a TSR of 5% when 
exported to countries that are outside the franc zone but are members of the ECOWAS (for 
example, Nigeria), and a TSR of 15% when exported to other countries outside the franc zone. 
For all other goods, the TSR rate is 10%. Niger has a large re-export trade (for example, 
cigarettes), mainly going to Nigeria, which is Niger's second most important trade partner, and 
live animals are the second largest export. Nigeria (2005) 
The export amendment decree of 1992 prescribes that all raw material or unprocessed 
commodities, whether mineral or agricultural, may be subject to the payment of an export levy 
as may be prescribed, from time to time, by order of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council 
(NEPC). In this respect, an administrative levy of US$5 per tonne is applied to exports of 
cocoa, and of US$32 per tonne to exports of other raw materials. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 31 Rwanda (LDC) 
(2004) No export taxes. Senegal (LDC) 
(2009, 2003) An annual royalty of 3% of the pit-head value (difference between the f.o.b. value of the 
mineral substance and all the costs incurred from the pit-head to the delivery point) is levied on 
gold exported. Sierra Leone 
(2005) Exports of cocoa and coffee products remain subject to a levy, currently set at 2.5% of the 
f.o.b. export value. As from 1980, a 3% tax has been levied on all diamond exports valued by 
the Government Gold and Diamond Office (GGDO), in conjunction with Diamond Counsellors 
International. South Africa 
(2009, 2003) South Africa levies a tax on exports of unpolished diamonds in order to promote the 
development of the local economy, develop skills, and create employment. As of 2008, export 
levy of 5% based on the value of exported unpolished diamonds has been applied. South 
Africa also imposes an export levy of R 0.05 per litre of exported wine. Suriname 
(2004) All exports are subject to a consent fee of 0.1%. A statistical fee of 0.5% applies to exports of 
all products except bauxite, which is subject to a statistical fee of 2%. These fees are assessed 
on the f.o.b. value of exports and are applied regardless of their destination. Suriname applies 
additional taxes on exports of raw and roughly processed timber. Rates are expressed as ad 
valorem rates of minimum f.o.b. values determined by the Government. In April 2004, the rates 
were 20% for logs, and 5% and 10% for hewn-squares, sleepers (ties), and other semi-
processed timber. In 2002, wood export taxes accounted for some 0.1% of current 
Government revenue. Swaziland 
(2009, 2003) The only tax or fee collected on exports is the Sugar Levy, which is charged at a rate of 5.75% 
of the proceeds from the net ex-mill export protocol sales to the EU, and applies two years in 
arrears. Tanzania (LDC) 
(2006) Tanzania applies an export tax on raw cashed nut, and a cess of 20% on raw hides and skins, 
to encourage local processing of these goods. Togo (LDC) 
(2006) Exports of agricultural, livestock and fishery products are subject to a levy by a way of advance 
payment on income tax or flat-rate taxes payable in their stead. Tunisia (2005) 
Since Tunisia's last TPR in 1994, many export taxes have been abolished, in particular, those 
on olive oil, fruit and vegetables, hides and skins, and cork. Tunisia now has two export taxes: 
one cyclical tax on exported scrap iron (90 dinars per ton), levied when scrap iron prices rise in 
order to discourage exports; and a  " customs services fee "  on crude oil exports (HS 2710), 
calculated as 3% of their value. Uganda (LDC) 
(2006) Uganda maintains a cess of 1% on exports of coffee (collected by the Uganda Coffee 
Development Authority), 2% on cotton (collected by the Cotton Development Organisation), 
and 20% on raw hides and skins. While the taxes on cotton and coffee are in place to finance 
promotional activities, the tax on raw hides and skins was introduced to encourage local 
processing of these goods. Zambia (LDC) 
(2009) The 2008 Budget encouraged local value addition by introducing an export levy of 15% on the 
export of copper concentrates and cotton seed (subsequently raised in the 2009 Budget to 
20% for cotton seed), in recognition of the availability of local capacity to process these 
products. An export tax exists on scrap metal, which is considered an important input for 
manufacturing. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 32 Americas Antigua and 
Barbuda (2007) Export taxes are applied on lobsters (ECD 0.10/lb) and fish (ECD 0.05/lb). Argentina (2007) Following the peso devaluation in 2002, all Argentine exports were again made subject to 
export duties. Resolution No. 11/2002 of the former Ministry of the Economy and Infrastructure 
established export duties of 10% on a specific set of goods and of 5% on all other goods 
except fuels, in addition to duties existing at that time. Since 2002, successive resolutions have 
altered export tax rates, with increases on a significant number of products. As at mid-2006, 
the applicable duties were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 45% on the f.o.b. value, depending on the 
goods in question. Export duties were introduced as price policy tools, to cushion the effect of 
exchange-rate fluctuations on domestic prices, particularly those of household necessities, and 
to counter the sharp fall in tax revenue. As a result, export duties have again become a major 
source of public revenue. Between 2002 and 2005, revenue collected from these duties 
averaged nearly 2.2% of GDP, the highest level recorded in the historical series that began in 
1932. During that period, income from export duties represented 9.2% of exports and 9.9% of 
total public revenue. Official f.o.b. prices are set for several dutiable agricultural exports, and 
the declared f.o.b. value of a given sale is accepted only if it corresponds to the value 
previously established by the competent authority. This procedure aims to establish the basis 
on which rates are applied in settlement of export duties, refunds, drawback, contributions, 
charges, services and other items that are levied on, or benefit, exportation of goods listed in 
Law No. 21.453. Barbados 
(2008) Barbados applies no taxes, charges or levies on exports, other than a levy on cotton exports of 
BDSD 0.17 per pound. The proceeds of this levy go to the Barbados Cotton Growers 
Association. Belize 
(2004) Taxes on the export of logwood, mahogany, pine, cedar, coconut, and sugar are established 
by the Produce Export Duties Act and the Sugar Act. However, the authorities indicate that all 
export taxes have been repealed. Under the Meat and Livestock Act 1977, the Belize Livestock 
Producers Association can impose a cess on both exports and domestic sales of cattle. The 
cess on exports is specified in the legislation at BZD 10 per head plus 2% of sales value for 
cattle for slaughter; and 2% of sales value for cattle for breeding. The legislation does not 
specify the amount to be applied to domestic sales of cattle. Bolivia 
(2005) Pursuant to the General Customs Law, no customs duty is imposed on exports unless 
otherwise specified in the Law. Nevertheless, in the case of minerals, exports are subject to the 
Impuesto Complementario a la Mineria – ICM (complementary mining tax), whose rate is 
higher than that applicable to minerals sold on the domestic market. Brazil 
(2009, 2004) Brazilian legislation allows for the application of an export tax of 30%, which can be decreased 
or increased (to up to 150%) by the Camara de Comercio Exterior (CAMEX). The export tax 
applies, in principle, to all exports, but with the exception of a few products, the tax is zero-
rated. Exports may be exempt from this tax according to their destination; coffee, sugar, 
alcohol, and related products are exempt. Export taxes are levied on three product categories 
down from seven product categories at the time of the previous review in 2004. In one case 
(leather and skins) levies are charged on all exports, while, in the other two cases (cigars and 
arms and ammunition), taxes are levied only on exports to certain markets, all of them in the 
western hemisphere. Minimum exports prices are not used, except as a base to calculate 
export taxes. Canada (OECD) 
(2007, 2003) Export duties are imposed on Canadian-manufactured tobacco products and as of 12 October 
2006, on softwood lumber destined for the United States. Exports of Canadian-produced 
cigarettes, tobacco sticks, and other manufactured tobacco to all destinations are subject to a 
two-tiered tax, with different rates for exports up to a threshold of 1.5% of a manufacturer's 
annual production (CAD 0.075 per cigarette) and for exports above the threshold (CAD 0.178 
per cigarette). The tax on exports up to the 1.5% threshold is refundable to the foreign importer 
and Canadian manufacturer upon proof of payment of taxes. The tax on exports over the 1.5% 
threshold is not refundable and approximates the total federal and provincial taxes otherwise 
applicable in the lowest-tax jurisdiction in Canada. The purpose of the export tax scheme is to 
reduce the incentive to smuggle Canadian-produced products back into Canada from export 
markets. On 12 September 2006, Canada and United States signed an agreement with respect 
to exports of Canadian softwood lumber. This followed a long-running trade dispute regarding TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 33 U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, which 
had been the subject of challenges. Canadian softwood lumber exporters will pay an export 
charge when the agreed reference price of lumber is at or below USD 355 per thousand board 
feet. Under the NAFTA and Canada's FTAs with Chile, Costa Rica and Israel, Canada has 
undertaken not to maintain any duty, tax or other charge on goods exported to the territory of 
the party(s) unless such levies are adopted or maintained on such goods for domestic 
consumption. Chile (2009, 
2003) No export taxes. Colombia (2006) There are contributions of a parafiscal nature applied to exports of certain products, such as 
coffee, emeralds, precious stones and some fuels. The coffee contribution tax is levied on 
exported coffee and is equivalent to 5% of the price of the mild coffee exported. The emerald 
contribution amounts to 1%, in foreign currency, of the export price of the unset emeralds. Costa Rica 
(2007) Banana exports are subject to a tax irrespective of their destination. A tax of USD 1 per box or 
container of 40 lb net of bananas exported is imposed. Banana producers receive USD 0.011 
per box exported from this tax. Since 1 January 2006, the Government imposed a minimum 
price for banana exports f.o.b. from Costa Rican ports amounting to USD 5.70 per 18.14 kg net 
box of top quality bananas. As far as coffee is concerned, in order to finance the operation, 
maintenance and administration of the ICAFE, Law No. 2762 determined a tax corresponding 
to 1.5% of the f.o.b. value of the coffee exported per 47kg unit of green coffee or its equivalent. Dominica (2007) There are export royalties of ECD 0.50/ton on sand and ECD 0.45/ton on stone. Dominican 
Republic (2008) In order to protect marine resources, Decree No. 11-01 of November 2001 introduced levies 
on the export of fish, molluscs and live crustaceans. The tax on fish is 0.03 Dominican pesos 
per kilogram (around USD 0.0009 per kilogram), while for molluscs and live crustaceans it is 
5% ad valorem. Pursuant to the Mining Law of June 1971, exports of mineral substances in 
their natural form or in the form of metalliferous mineral concentrates is subject to a royalty or 
minimum tax of 5% of the f.o.b. selling price; this royalty can be credited against payment of 
income tax (ISR) for the same fiscal year. Ecuador 
(2005) Ecuador abolished export taxes through the Law on Facilitation of Exports and Waterborne 
Transport. However, the exports are subject to the "redeemable quota, "  and minimum prices 
apply to exports of certain products. The redeemable quota applied to exports amounts to 0.15 
% of their f.o.b. value, except for petroleum and petroleum products, which are subject to a 
redeemable quota of 0.05 %. Exports of ungrounded coffee, roasted ungrounded coffee and 
roasted ground coffee are subject to a contribution amounting to 2 % of their f.o.b. value. The 
proceeds of the contributions go to the National Coffee Board. Exports of banana and 
plantains, cocoa, coffee, shrimp and fish products are subject to minimum reference prices. 
The value declared on the single export form may not be less than the minimum reference 
price set for each product. El Salvador 
(2003) No export taxes. Guyana 
(2009, 2003) Export taxes are applied to almost all exported products, apart from manufactured goods and 
exempted items. Unless otherwise specified, a general rate of 1.5% is applied. Since 2003 the 
only change to the items subject to export duties is the removal of shrimp. A wide range of 
articles are exempt from export duties: raw gold; agricultural products and their by-products 
(excluding cane sugar and molasses); forest products including timber and lumber; alumina; 
manganese; goods exported to CARICOM (Caribbean Community) states. Grenada 
(2007) No export taxes. Guatemala 
(2009) The only export taxes concern the coffee sector. Coffee growers must pay 1% of the f.o.b. 
export value of coffee, of which Q 0.10/100 kg go to the municipal authorities and the rest to 
Anacafe. Haiti (LDC) 
(2004) No export taxes. According to Article 167 of the Customs Code, goods for export are subject to 
payment of duties that appear in the tariff as exit duties. However, the liberalization process 
initiated in 1986 has led to the gradual and complete abolition of customs duties on exports. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 34 Honduras 
(2003) No export taxes. Jamaica 
(2005) No export taxes. Mexico (OECD) 
(2008) Export taxes applied to 19 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level, including shells and claws of 
turtles, bone substances, human blood, skins of wildcats, etc. (Also Exports are subject to the 
DTA (Derecho de Tramite Aduanero) unless they are going to a country that is party to a free-
trade agreement signed with Mexico. The general rate is MXN 202 (around USD 18) per 
transaction.) Nicaragua 
(2006) No export taxes. Panama 
(2007) There are no taxes on exports, except for exports of finished products made of native woods, 
which are subject to a 1% tax under Forest Law. Paraguay 
(2005) No export taxes were levied between 1997 and 2001. An export tax of 12% on fresh or salted 
bovine hides was introduced in 2002. Initially, the tax was applied on f.o.b. value of exports, but 
Decree No. 20.135/03 established a minimum unit value for customs purpose of USD 35 for 
exported hides, and the tax is applied on this value, irrespective of the place of destination. An 
export tax of 4% on soybeans, concerning the 2003/2004 harvest, and irrespective of the place 
of destination, was introduced in 2004. The dutiable value is set at US$80 per ton exported. 
The declared purpose of the taxes on hides and soybeans is to promote the local processing of 
those products. In both cases, the main reason cited for their application is the lack of raw 
materials for the domestic processing industry and the increase in exports of unprocessed 
products, taking into account, according to the Paraguayan authorities, the distortion created in 
subregional trade by the taxes on hide exports applied by Argentina and Uruguay. Peru (2007) 
No export taxes. The notional 0% tax levied on exports for statistical purpose was repealed in 
2004. St. Kitts and 
Nevis (2007) Export taxes are applied on live animals, lobster and cotton. Revenue from this tax represents 
less than 2% of tax revenue. St. Lucia (2007) 
No export taxes. St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines 
(2007) No export taxes. Trinidad and 
Tobago (2005) No export taxes. United States 
(OECD) 
(2008, 2006, 
2004) No export taxes. Uruguay (2006) 
Exports of bovine, sheep, pig, horse and poultry meats, irrespective of their form but with the 
exception of preserved meat, are subject to the FIS tax at a rate of 1% of the f.o.b. value of the 
exports. The FIS also applies to some sales on the domestic market. Exports of raw, salted, 
pickled and wet-blue hides pay a 5% tax. Exports of some other agricultural products are 
subject to payment of taxes or levies intended to finance bodies such as the Uruguayan Wool 
Secretariat (SUL), and the National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA). Note: Descriptions are drawn from TPR reports, but in some cases have been abbreviated or changed as appropriate to meet the 
analytical objective of this paper. For further details, see the TPR reports TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 35 Annex 2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER EXPORT RESTRICTIONS IN TPR REPORTS Europe/Middle East Bahrain (2007) 
Bahrain prohibits exports of some products including certain foodstuffs and fuels. Export 
restrictions apply to, inter alia, live horses, camels, and antiques. Bulgaria (2003) 
Since January 2000, Bulgaria has liberalized its export licensing procedures. Currently, 
export licences are required in a limited number of cases such as fulfilment of 
international treaties and conventions to which Bulgaria is a signatory; protecting public 
morals; maintaining public order and national security; and safeguarding national artistic, 
historical, and architectural masterpieces. Licences are issued by the competent 
government ministries depending on the product and are valid for up to three months from 
the date of issue. Automatic licensing (registration) is applied to precious metals and 
unsawn timber exports (except for fire-burnt timber). Before its accession to the WTO, 
Bulgaria imposed quantitative restrictions on certain exports in order to ensure adequate 
supplies in the domestic market and prevent or relieve critical shortages. For instance, 
autonomous quotas were applied to the exports of goats, wheat, and barley. Upon 
accession in 1996, Bulgaria abandoned all quantitative restrictions on exports of 
agricultural products. European Union (25) 
(2009, 2007, 2004) Export restrictions are allowed on grounds of public morality, the protection of health and 
life of humans, animals and plants, and national cultural treasures. The restrictions are 
under the competence of both the Commission and Member States. An export 
authorization or license is required for the export of cultural goods and certain products 
under the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), and for the control of exports of dual-use 
items and technology according to provisions set out in Regulation 1334/2000 (last 
amended by Regulation 1183/2007). The export of software or technology by electronic 
media, fax or telephone is also subject to authorization under the dual-use regime. Export 
licences are required to export goods covered by the CAP from the EU. Georgia (2009) 
Georgia does not apply export quotas. Export licensing restrictions are applied only for 
reasons of healthcare, environmental protection, national heritage and security. Iceland (OECD) (2006) Export restrictions, prohibitions, and licensing apply in a number of cases including 
narcotics, and ozone-depleting substances. Israel (2006) 
Currently some 35 items, by broad category, require a licence for various reasons, such 
as the control of quality and standards of goods, compliance with international 
agreements (including those regarding dangerous drugs and protection of plants and 
animals), and conservation of local resources. Most of the goods covered by the control 
requirement are agricultural products or chemicals. Jordan (2008) 
Export prohibitions, restrictions, and licensing are regulated through Import and Export 
Law No. 21 of 2001, as amended by Temporary Law No. 18 of 2003. Automatic licensing 
applies to, inter alia, wheat and other wheat-based products (including macaroni and 
vermicelli) to ensure that the consumer subsidies granted on these products are 
reimbursed by exporters when the products are exported. Jordan is introducing non-
automatic licensing to dual-use products (the goods covered by the dual-use export 
control system of the European Communities). Liechtenstein (2008, 
2004) Lichtenstein continues to maintain export controls on certain products on grounds of 
safety, security, and environment, and to ensure compliance with international obligations 
under treaties and conventions to which they are signatories. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 36 Norway (OECD) 
(2008, 2004) Norway applies trade embargos on the basis of US Security Council Resolutions relating 
to Iran, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, etc. Since 2004, Norway has amended the 
Customs Act to prohibit the export or re-export of counterfeit goods. Seven categories 
including hazardous waste, minke whale products, cultural objects are subject to export 
prohibitions or licensing. Oman (2008) 
Oman prohibits exports of antiques, and ancient manuscripts. Export restrictions apply to 
date seedlings and to three species of fish (lobster, abalone, and shark) during the 
breeding and reproduction seasons when fishing is not allowed. Qatar (2005) 
Export prohibitions apply to alcoholic products. They also apply to, inter alia, species of 
fish and seafood products for food security reasons. Romania (2005) 
Exports are prohibited or controlled for various reasons, including environment, health, 
public morality, national security, or to give effect to Romania's obligations under 
international conventions. Switzerland (OECD) 
(2008, 2004) Switzerland continues to maintain export controls on certain products on grounds of 
safety, security, and environment, and to ensure compliance with international obligations 
under treaties and conventions to which they are signatories. Turkey (OECD) 
(2007, 2003) Turkey prohibits exports of 14 items (by broad category) for environment, health, cultural 
reasons, or to give effect to obligations under international conventions. Each firm 
producing oil products is subject to an export quota of 35% of production. An export 
license is required for 25 categories of products including endangered species of wild 
fauna and flora. The government has a power to make goods for export subject to quality 
control, and the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UTF) is responsible for enforcing 
quality control of these commodities. Some 200 agricultural products (at the 12-digit HS 
level) are subject to compulsory export controls for quality purposes. The coverage 
includes citrus fruit, a variety of edible oils, and some hazelnuts. United Arab Emirates 
(2006) The UAE maintains export controls (through permits) on certain products for safety, 
security, and environmental reasons, and to ensure compliance with international 
obligations under treaties and conventions (e.g. the Basel Convention, CITES, the 
Convention on Chemical Weapons, the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation) to which it is 
a signatory. Asia/Pacific Australia (OECD) 
(2007) Exports of some goods are restricted, unless permission or a licence is granted. These 
include asbestos; biological agents; cetacearns (whales, dolphins, and porpoises); 
chemical compounds; some cultural and heritage goods; defence and strategic goods; 
diamonds (Kimberley process); drugs; endangered animal and plant species (subject to 
the CITES); firearms, parts, accessories, and ammunition; hazardous waste; human 
blood and other body fluids, organs and tissue; human embryos; ozone depleting 
substances. Discretionary export licensing restrictions are maintained for reasons related 
to SPS, the environment, and alignment with international agreements. Bangladesh (LDC) 
(2006) Goods subject to export prohibition are listed in the Export Policy 2003-2006; the number 
of goods on the list has been reduced from 19 to 16 since the previous review. According 
to the authorities, the bans on exports of agricultural commodities and manufactured 
goods are in place mainly for reasons of health, eco-balance, security, archaeological 
value, or maintenance of adequate domestic supply. There is no export licensing 
requirement per se, although an export certificate may be required from the relevant 
authorities for certain products. Brunei Darussalam 
(2008) Export prohibitions remain in place for prawn refuse and copra cake, and exports of 
timber, oil palm, rice, and sugar are still restricted. Export licenses are required for 
cigarettes, diesel, gasoline, kerosene, and salt. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 37 China 
(2008, 2006) In 2007, China maintained general export prohibitions on 40 items at the HS 8-digit level 
(up from 25 items in 2004). Prohibited items include mainly materials relating to State 
precious and rare animals and plants. The added lines are mineral products (HS Chapter 
25) and some chemicals (HS Chapter 29). China maintains both global export quotas and 
destination-specific quotas regarding Hong Kong and Macao. When determining the size 
of quotas, the authorities consider, inter alia: national security, availability of domestic 
resources for downstream processing, development plans for certain domestic industries, 
and international and domestic demand. In 2007, 447 tariff lines at HS 8-digit level were 
subject to export quotas and licensing administration (316 in 2005, and 319 in 2004). 
Global export quotas applied to 146 lines at the HS 8-digit level in 2007 (down from 
179 lines in 2004). From 1 January 2008, global export quotas are also applied to flours 
of some grain products. China's non-automatic export licensing requirements are 
implemented mainly to fulfil its obligations under international agreements, such as: 
Articles XX and XXI of GATT 1994; the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer. Export licenses have also been used to reduce exports of certain products: 
some steel products (83 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level) have been subject to licensing 
requirements since 20 May 2007. Automatic export licenses, which apply largely for 
statistical purposes, were required for 284 lines (at the US 8-digit level) in 2007 (40 in 
2004). Chinese Taipei 
(2006) Export prohibitions cover some 48 tariff lines (HS 10-digit level), mainly products that are 
banned under international conventions, such as toxic chemicals, arms and ammunition, 
and narcotics. In addition, exports of trout and salmon products, plants used for 
pharmaceutical purposes and antiques are prohibited. Exports of certain fish, including 
trout and salmon, are prohibited for reasons of fishery conservation. Another 41 items are 
currently subject to export licensing (7 February 2006). Fiji (2009) 
Prohibited exports are dangerous drugs (i.3. narcotics) as well as all live fish, and turtle 
flesh and shells not meeting certain size limits. Exports of round logs are banned for 
environmental reasons and to promote downstream processing, which provides an 
implicit subsidy to processors at the expense of forest owners, by lowering the domestic 
price. Exports of a wide range of agricultural products require an export licence from the 
relevant authority, e.g. live cattle, manufactured sugar in consignments exceeding 5 kgs, 
wheat brain, copra, oil cake and copra meal, various wood and wood products, and 
coffee. Hong Kong, China 
(2006, 2003) Exports of ozone-depleting substances to non-parties to the Montreal Protocol are 
banned. Hong Kong also complies with trade sanctions imposed by the UN Security 
Council. India (2007) 
Export prohibitions are in place for environmental, food security, marketing, pricing, and 
domestic supply reasons, and to comply with international treaties. In addition to these 
export prohibitions, India also issues ad hoc prohibitions on exports of sensitive products; 
for example, export prohibitions have recently been issued for wheat, pulses, and sugar. 
Also 171 lines at the HS 8-digit level (excluding special chemicals, organisms, materials, 
equipment, and technologies) are currently subject to restrictions; products may only be 
exported if a licence is issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), on the 
approval of its Export Facilitation Committee. Indonesia (2007, 2003) During 2003-06, export licensing, prohibitions, and restrictions were maintained to ensure 
protection of natural resources and endangered species (e.g. in accordance with CITES); 
promote higher-value-added downstream industries; upgrade the quality of export 
products; and provide an adequate supply of essential products. Before 2005, Indonesia 
exercised export control by dividing exports into two types,  " supervised "  exports and 
"regulated" exports. Export approval requirements had to be met for  " supervised "  
products, including certain live bovine animals, live fish, palm nuts/kernels, lead and 
bauxite ores/concentrate, petroleum oils/products, urea fertilizer, crocodile leather, 
unprotected wild animals and plants, unprocessed silver/gold, and waste/scrap of metals. 
Indonesia also conducted licensing and quota administration over regulated exports, 
including: coffee, textiles and clothing, rubber, veneer and plywood or similar laminated 
wood, teakwood, and mixed rattan and semi-prepared rattan. New export-import 
regulations issued in 2005 lifted restrictions on the export of tapioca, semi-processed 
rattan and silver. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 38 Japan (OECD) (2009, 
2007, 2005) Export controls (prior approval) are maintained to ensure national security and public 
safety and to ensure adequate domestic supplies of certain agricultural and other primary 
products. For certain agricultural products, including wheat bran, rice bran, oat bran, 
clams, mussels and eels, the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry needs the consent 
of the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries prior to granting export approval. Korea (OECD) (2008, 
2004) Export prohibitions, affecting 11 six-digit HS items, are maintained to protect animal 
rights, endangered species, and preserve natural resources. Exports of sand and gravel-
related items have to be approved by the Korean Aggregate Association to protect natural 
resources. Kyrgyz Republic (2006) Export licences, administered by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, apply to a 
range of products for reasons of human safety and public health, environmental 
protection (including under international conventions), national security, and preservation 
of art, historical and archaeological treasures, and exhaustible natural resources. Goods 
include weapons; explosives; nuclear materials and technology for military use; virulent 
poisons; narcotics (including used in pharmaceuticals) and psychotropic substances; art 
works and antiquities with historical, cultural or scientific value; ferrous, precious, and 
rare-earth metals and their fragments; and rare raw materials of vegetable or animal origin 
having pharmacological applications. According to the authorities, except for non-ferrous 
metal fragments and waste, licensing is not intended to restrict exports but to control 
exports of stolen materials. Macao, China (2007) 
No products are subject to export restrictions and controls except CITES species, ozone 
depleting substances, toxic chemicals and precursory substances, etc. Maldives (LDC) (2009, 
2003) Exports of live fish are subject to licensing, and trade in timber is controlled. Exports of 
certain marine species are prohibited for environmental reasons. Malaysia (2006) 
The Customs (Prohibition of Exports) Order 1998, under the Customs Act 1967, sets out 
export control requirements in three schedules. The first schedule consists of items that 
are absolutely prohibited from being exported, for example arms and related materials of 
all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, police 
equipment, and spare parts. Exports of turtle eggs are prohibited as are exports of rattan 
from peninsular Malaysia. The second schedule comprises goods subject to export 
licensing. Licences are required for all exports to Israel, and for 43 product groups. The 
third schedule consists of items that can be exported only after meeting certain criteria for 
the protection of wildlife, health, security, and antiquities. In 2001, 36% of Malaysia's tariff 
lines were subject to export licensing requirements; this level does not appear to have 
changed, although current data were not provided. The list of products subject to export 
licensing requirement also appears to be identical to that of 2001. Mongolia (2005) 
Exports of drugs and narcotics (and raw materials and equipment that can produce them) 
and certain dangerous and poisonous chemicals are prohibited; exports of raw hides, 
skins, and cashmere are prohibited with a view to protecting domestic processors. There 
are no licensing requirements for exporters in Mongolia, except on some items including 
guns, explosives and certain drugs. New Zealand (OECD) 
(2009, 2003) Export restrictions are maintained mainly for health and safety reasons, but also in the 
case of some agricultural products, including meat and dairy products, in order to manage 
trade partners' import requirements, and in the case of some horticulture products and 
kiwifruit, for marketing reasons. Pakistan (2008) 
Export prohibitions focus on health, social, religious, or environmental protection under 
international treaties e.g. CITES. They also cover exports of wood and timber generally. 
Wheat flour exports were also banned in 2007 due to domestic supply shortages. 
Precious and semi-precious stones and gold jewellery are subject to special procedures. Philippines (2005) 
Exports are prohibited or regulated on grounds of national interest, security, and public 
health, and to fulfil the requirements of international agreements and conventions (e.g. 
the CITES). The authorities indicate that exports of logs from native forests are also 
banned for environmental reasons. Regulated exports require prior export clearance from 
the relevant government agencies. Exports of rice and corn remain restricted. In order to 
ensure food security and price stability, these commodities may be exported only if there 
is a surplus, according to the authorities. Fish exports are also regulated on grounds of 
domestic food security. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 39 Singapore (2008, 
2004) Security, health, and environmental concerns underlie Singapore's export restrictions and 
mainly involve endangered species under the CITES Convention, arms, explosives and 
explosive precursors, chemicals, and radioactive materials. Licensing controls are also 
maintained on rice, excluding rice bran, under which all rice traders must be licensed. Solomon Islands (LDC) 
(2009) Timber exports require  " specific authority "  from the Central Bank. The purpose of this 
measure is  " to ensure that log exporters obtain open market prices for their log exports 
and remit the full proceeds to Solomon Islands " . A licence is required to export other 
products subject to export taxes, war relics, live fish, and wildlife specimens. Sri Lanka (2004) 
Export prohibitions and licensing remain in place to protect the national heritage, public 
health, and the environment (including endangered species). Exports of tea are subject to 
quality check prior to exportation. Exporters of gems must obtain a Gem Dealers Licence 
(renewable on a yearly basis) from the National Gem and Jewellery Authority. Thailand (2007, 2003) 
Changes in Thailand's export licensing and prohibitions since 2003 include the elimination 
of prohibitive export licensing requirements on jute and kenaf seed, live bovine animals, 
277 kinds of wild animal, fuel oil and products thereof, and fertilizer. Since May 2003, 
Thailand has issued export certificates for rough diamond under the Kimberly Process 
Scheme before export. The Export-Import Control Law regulates the export of items that 
are in short supply domestically or that might unduly affect prices. The quota system is 
ostensibly applied to help improve the livelihood of farmers and food security in the 
country. For example, a portion of sugar production is reserved for domestic 
consumption; the remainder may be exported to the world market. Africa Angola (LDC) (2006) 
Exports of some products including poisonous or toxic substances or drugs, animals, and 
gold and silver are restricted. Benin (LDC) (2004) 
With a view to preserving natural resources and in the wake of a shortage on the 
domestic market, since 1997 exports of teak in the rough and charcoal have been 
prohibited. On the other hand, exports of sawn teak in the form of boards, parquet flooring 
and planks are authorized. Exports of seed cotton are prohibited. The export of precious 
metals requires approval from the Ministry of Finance, except in the case of items 
containing a small quantity of metal, items weighing less than 500 grams or up to 10 gold 
coins. Botswana (2009, 2003) Export licences are required for all exports, including to Southern Africa Customs Union 
(SACU) members, for food security, sanitary and phytosanitary, and statistical reasons, 
and under international conventions to which Botswana is a signatory. Burkina Faso (LDC) 
(2004) Works of art are the only export subject to an authorization and a permit from the Ministry 
of Culture. Burundi (LDC) (2003) 
Coffee berry exports are banned. Exports of sugar are subject to a quota which varies 
depending on local demand. The sugar quota is managed through the SOSUMO 
company (Société sucrière du Moso), which has a production monopoly. The State 
determines the quantity of sugar to be sold to distributors in each region according to their 
estimates of demand and the market price for sugar. As a party to the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Burundi 
prohibits ivory exports. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 40 Cameroon (2007) 
In principle, quantitative restrictions (including prohibitions) and controls in force on 
exports derive for the most part from treaties to which Cameroon is a party (Basel 
Convention on the Control of Transborder Movements of Hazardous Waste, CITES, or 
Chemical Weapons Convention inter alia). Restrictions are, however, maintained on 
exports of logs for economic reasons. Following the adoption of Ordinance No. 99/001 in 
1999, Cameroon has set about gradually prohibiting exports of logs in order to promote 
the processing industry. From 1999 until the prohibiting of log exports in 2004, a 
certificate of registration had to be obtained to export timber, which was intended to 
ensure that 70 % of production was processed locally and only 30 % of the annual 
harvest exported as logs. However, the Ordinance also provides for log exports to 
continue, subject to surtax, with the aim of promoting certain species. The export of two 
species (Sapelli and Ayous) is subject to quantitative restrictions with exporters being 
given quotas proportionate to the efforts invested in processing or exporting the species 
being promoted which may be exported as logs. However, according to the authorities, 
the loss brought about by prohibiting exports of most logs has not been offset by an 
increase of processed timber. Central African 
Republic (LDC) (2007) The Central African Republic has eliminated all quantitative export restrictions. It has 
participated in the Kimberley Process for trade in rough diamonds since April 2003. Chad (LDC) (2007) 
In general, the only quantitative restrictions and controls in force on exports should be 
those derived from the treaties to which Chad is party (Basle Convention, CITES, 
Chemical Weapons Convention, Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). In 
practice, there are few restrictions or controls. Congo (LDC) (2006) 
An export declaration must be filed for all goods being exported or re-exported. Under the 
Forestry Code, only processed wood in the finished or semi-finished state may be 
exported, but in practice each forestry enterprise is required to limit rough timber exports 
to 15 % of its total production volume. This threshold is often exceeded, triggering 
payment of the 15 % surcharge. Under the Mining Code, every shipment of precious 
minerals requires an export authorization issued by the central mining authority. Djibouti (LDC) (2006) 
The export of sawn timber and coral is prohibited. According to the authorities, apart from 
the restrictions imposed under the international agreements signed by Djibouti, there are 
no other export restrictions. Djibouti does not currently require export licences. Egypt (2005) 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Law 118/1975, the export of certain commodities can be 
prohibited or restricted through Ministerial decree. The authorities indicate, however, that 
Egypt does not maintain any export quotas, licences, or prohibitions. Gambia (LDC) (2004) 
Export prohibition, controls, and limitations are decided by the President. The current list 
is identical to the list of prohibited or restricted imports; that list includes counterfeit or 
non-standard coins or currency notes, firearms that are not properly licensed, narcotic 
drugs, rough or uncut diamonds, certain types of noxious gases. Ghana (2008) 
Exports of unprocessed logs, raw rattan cane and bamboo are prohibited. Export permits 
or certificates are required for a number of products, including mineral ore, and 
chemicals. Guinea (LDC) (2005) 
The exports of raw diamonds are subject to the Kimberley process certification scheme. 
One important focus of Guinea's action is improving the quality of local products and 
products for export (in particular, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products) through the 
adoption of international quality and health safety standards. Kenya (2006) 
Export prohibitions apply to round-wood and, if sent by post, to firearms and ammunition 
of all types, and to other articles having the appearances of lethal weapons. A licence is 
required for exports of most agricultural products, food, minerals, and mineral products. 
Exports of certain agricultural and food products are subject to special licences for self-
sufficiency purposes. Lesotho (LDC) (2009, 
2003) Some livestock and livestock products are subject to export controls. Only licensed 
diamond dealers or producers, or their accredited agents, may export diamonds. Madagascar (LDC) 
(2008) Madagascar has prohibited exports of certain species of wood in rough or semi-finished 
form since July 2007, but authorizes exports in finished form. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 41 Mali (LDC) (2004) 
Export prohibitions are either absolute or restrictive. The absolute prohibition regime 
applies to exports of young bovine breeding animals, whereas the restrictive regime 
affects the following: (i) exports of meat and live animals (which require a health or animal 
health certificate issued by the Ministry of Livestock); (ii) hunting trophies (submission of a 
permit or certificate in conformity with the CITES issued by the competent technical 
services); (iii) plants (submission of a phytosanitary certificate issued by the competent 
technical services); and (iv) works of art (authorization from the Ministry responsible for 
art and culture). Mauritius (2008) 
Export bans are maintained under international convention to which Mauritius is a 
signatory. Export permits are required for products considered  " strategic "  or  " sensitive "  to 
the economy, and such products include sugar, sand, and limestone. Morocco (2009, 2003) 
Since 2003, a number of changes have been made to the list of products subject to 
quantitative restrictions (and thus to export licensing). Consequently, in addition to cereal 
flour (except rice flour), charcoal, collections and specimens for various collections 
(zoological, botanical, mineralogical, and archaeological); and antiques over 100 years 
old, since May 2003 the list has included substances and equipment using ozone-
depleting substances, and since August 2008, wheat and meslin, rye, barley, oats, maize, 
rice, grain sorghum, other cereals, groats and semolina of common flour and barley. 
Tanned hides and skins or crust leather of bovine animals, sheep and goats were 
removed from the list in December 2006. Mozambique 
(LDC)(2009) Special export regulations apply to certain products including plant and vegetable matter; 
animals and products thereof; products subject to export taxes, such as cashews; 
precious metals, gemstones, and mineral products; gold and silver, which may only be 
exported by the Bank of Mozambique. Since 2002, a prohibition applies to exports of 
unprocessed wood, reserved to local processors, but not to exports of unprocessed 
precious tropical wood species, such as ebony and rosewood. Namibia (2009, 2003) 
Exports, except to SACU members, are subject to automatic licensing, except for some 
products that require a non-automatic permit. These include medicines; live animals and 
genetic materials; all ostrich breeding materials; meat and game products; protected 
species under CITES; plants; firearms and explosives; and minerals, including diamonds 
and gold. Export permits from the Meat Board of Namibia are required for exports of 
livestock. Export permits for maize, wheat and mahangu are required from the Namibian 
Agronomic Board. Niger (LDC) (2009, 
2003) Since 1998, Niger has imposed an export ban on seed cotton in order to guarantee the 
development of the cotton subsector. As part of the measures taken to offset the 2005 
food crisis, the re-export of milled rice has been banned since 2005. Nigeria (2005) 
Under Nigeria's Export Prohibition Act, certain exports are prohibited for purposes of 
domestic food security, value-added considerations, and preservation of cultural heritage. 
Currently, the ban covers raw hides and skins, timber (rough or sawn), scrap metals, 
unprocessed rubber latex and rubber lumps, rice, yams, maize, beans, and artefacts and 
antiquities. Nigeria's food safety regulations require export licences for unprocessed food 
products; in certain cases, the Minister for Agriculture is empowered to prescribe grades 
and standards of quality for these products. Rawanda (LDC) (2004) According to the authorities, other than restrictions under international agreements of 
which Rwanda is a signatory, there are no restrictions on exports. Senegal (LDC) (2009, 
2003) Senegal does not currently apply any prohibition or quantitative restriction on exports. 
The export of the following goods requires an authorization: gold, hides and skins, and 
petroleum products. Senegal also imposes prohibitions and licensing under the 
multilateral environmental agreements it has signed such as the CITES. Sierra Leone (2005) 
Export restrictions are maintained for health, safety, and environmental reasons. A 
special permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources is required for 
the exportation of plants and charcoal. Gold and diamonds, as well as any other goods or 
materials as may be prescribed by law, are subject to export licensing requirements. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 42 South Africa 
(2009, 2003) A number of products are still subject to export control, including export permits (licences) and 
prohibition. Controls are maintained on grounds of safety, security, and the environment, and to 
ensure compliance with international obligations under treaties and conventions to which South 
Africa is a signatory (for example, the Montreal Protocol). Exports of meat require a health 
certificate and the payment of fees, depending upon the province, prior to export. Exports of any 
alcoholic product with an alcohol content of more than 1%, except for beer, sorghum beer, and 
medicines, require an export certificate. Suriname 
(2004) The Negative List Decision adopted under the Law on the Movement of Goods lists the products 
that are currently subject to export restrictions, which can take the form of prohibitions or non-
automatic licensing requirements. Swaziland 
(2009, 2003) Export restrictions apply to products controlled under the various conventions on threatened 
species, etc. to which Swaziland belongs. Export prohibitions may also be imposed in case of 
food shortages resulting from drought or other natural disasters. Tanzania (LDC) 
(2006) Since June 1998, export restrictions in the agriculture sector have been in place for white maize, 
rice, cereals, beans, and unprocessed fish products; these are due to the precarious food 
supply situation brought about by the ongoing drought conditions. Togo (LDC) 
(2006) Commodity exports (coffee, cocoa, cotton fibre) have been free of all licensing requirements 
since 1996. Coffee, cocoa and seed cotton are subject to quality, packaging and marking 
standards. The exportation of rough diamonds from Togo is subject to the Kimberley Process 
certification system. Tunisia (2005) 
There are several product groups that can only be exported with the prior authorization of the 
Ministry of Trade, valid for six months. The main purpose of authorization is to prevent 
shortages and ensure the availability of inputs for domestic industry. Uganda (LDC) 
(2006) Exports of items that appear on Uganda's negative list are not allowed, and certain exports 
require authorization from regulatory bodies. The negative list of exports includes timber, 
charcoal, and whole fresh fish. For items covered by international conventions to which Uganda 
is a signatory, such as some wild animals and their trophies, prior authorization must be 
obtained from the Uganda Wildlife Authority; this is granted only if the exporter can satisfy the 
authorities that the export is sustainable without endangering the species. Zambia (LDC) 
(2009) Export prohibitions apply to certain types of logs under international agreements, and 
occasionally for grains (during drought years). There are no general export licensing 
requirements (except for prescribed goods) although certain goods, such as fertilizers and 
gemstones require special export permits. Americas Antigua and 
Barbuda (2007) Exports of wild birds are prohibited, as well as exports of any live or dead wildlife or parts, in 
accordance with the CITES. Argentina (2007) 
Since the previous trade policy review, export prohibitions have been reintroduced for 
commercial reasons. In July 2005, it was decided to suspend exports of tailings of copper and 
aluminium and their alloys for 90 days. The export ban was extended in March 2006 for a period 
of 180 days. MEP Resolution No. 114 of 8 March 2006 suspended exports of bovine livestock 
on the hoof and of certain cuts and preparations and preserves of bovine meat for a period of 
180 days, except for foreign sales of "Hilton beef" subject to tariff quotas and sales covered by 
bilateral agreements. The MEP justified the measure as necessary to maintain the stability of 
beef prices in the face of price increases caused partly by external demand. This was prompted 
by the National Government's priority of maintaining supply to the domestic market at 
reasonable prices. In May 2006, the export ban was replaced by a quantitative restriction under 
MEP Resolution No. 397/2006. Specifically, an export quota was set for the period between 1 
June and 30 November 2006, equivalent to 40 % of the volume recorded in the same period in 
2005, with a requirement not to exceed 50 % of this total in each quarter. The established quota 
is shared among exporters in proportion to the physical volume exported in the reference period. 
In addition to the rules officially restricting exports, the Government has concluded agreements 
whereby exporters of certain goods agree to voluntarily restrain their foreign sales, so as to 
control price trends for these goods in the domestic market. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 43 Barbados 
(2008) At the end of 2007, an export license was required for: black coral, live sheep and goats; 
tortoiseshell; and radioactive chemical elements. These licenses are not automatic and apply 
irrespective of destination. Belize 
(2004) Under the Supplies Control Act, 1963 (Cap. 293, 2000) and the Supplies Control (Import/Export) 
Regulations, exports of certain products require a licence, regardless of their destination. 
Licences for beans and sugar are automatic; for all other products – live animals, fish, 
crustaceans and molluscs, logs and lumber and citrus fruit – the Supply Control Unit must 
generally consult with the government body or association responsible for the product before 
granting the licence. No export licences are granted for rosewood or medicate log and lumber, 
and all other unfinished articles manufactured therefrom. According to the authorities, in 2003, 
the Supplies Control Unit granted five export licences for live animals, 77 for fish, crustaceans 
and molluscs, 113 for logs and lumber, 16 for beans, and 67 for sugar; no export licences were 
issued for citrus. Bolivia (2005) 
In general, export of products affecting public health, State security, conservation of fauna and 
flora and the cultural, historical and archaeological heritage is banned. Other exports may also 
be prohibited by law. Pursuant to the 1996 Forestry Law (Law No. 1.700 of 12 July 1996), the 
export of unprocessed forestry products is subject to restrictions and is strictly regulated. Brazil (2009, 
2004) Exports of some organic chemicals included in HS Chapter 29 are prohibited to non-signatories 
of the Montreal Protocol. Brazil also restricts exports to comply with United Nations resolutions: 
exports of weapons and military equipment to Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are 
forbidden. Exports of certain wood (pine, imbuia, and virola) are subject to specific rules and 
require prior authorization from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (IBAMA). Exports of a relatively large number of products are subject to prior 
authorization from different agencies, generally for safety, health, security or environmental 
reasons, or when they are subject to export quotas. The list included some 663 tariff headings at 
the HS eight-digit level in April 2008, representing some 6.8% of all tariff headings. Canada (OECD) 
(2007, 2003) Most Canadian export controls are in place under the Export and Import Permits Act, 
administered by the Export and Import Control Bureau. Section 3 of the Export and Import 
Permits Act, the Export Control List (ECL), contains articles controlled for any of the following 
purposes: to ensure that any action taken to promote and encourage the further processing in 
Canada of a natural resource that is produced in Canada is not rendered ineffective by reason 
of the unrestricted exportation of that natural resource; to limit or keep under surveillance the 
export of any raw or processed good that is produced in Canada in circumstances of surplus 
supply and depressed prices and that is not an agricultural product; to implement an 
intergovernmental arrangement or commitment; to ensure that there is an adequate supply and 
distribution of the article in Canada for defence or other needs; or to control the export of arms, 
ammunition, implements or munitions of war or articles of a strategic nature or value the use of 
which might be detrimental to the security of Canada. The vast majority of controlled exports are 
controlled pursuant to international agreements that Canada has signed. Chile (2009, 
2003) Chile does not have an export licensing regime. No Chilean exports are subject to export 
quotas, which are prohibited by Law No. 18.840. Export prohibitions or controls apply to goods 
whose trade is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES). Chile also prohibits exports of goods such as: (i) anthropological, archaeological, 
ethnic, historic, and paleontological objects and their parts; (ii) Chilean pine (botanical name 
araucaria araucana) and larch; and (iii) psychotropic substances and other chemicals. Colombia 
(2006) Colombia has commitments to apply restrictions on the exportation of certain products under the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the Basel 
Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their 
Disposal and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Exports of 
goods that form part of Colombia's cultural, artistic, archaeological and historical heritage are 
also restricted. Coffee exports are prohibited if they do not comply with the quality standards 
established by the National Coffee Growers' Committee. Costa Rica 
(2007) Export prohibitions are mainly imposed for reasons of national security, protection of 
Costa Rica's heritage and for environmental reasons. Article 26 of Forestry Law No. 7575 of 
13 February 1996 bans the export of logs and roughly squared wood from forests of specific 
species. The objective of the Forestry Law is, inter alia, to ensure the conservation of natural 
forests, the industrialization of forestry resources intended for this purpose and the creation of 
employment. The authorities have pointed out that Article 26 of Forestry Law No. 7575 is part of TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 44 the policy for the recovery and sustainable use of forests, an area in which Costa Rica has 
made substantial progress over the past two decades. Dominica 
(2007) Exports of any wildlife or parts thereof are forbidden. This export prohibition is for the protection 
and conservation of wildlife. Dominican 
Republic (2008) The export of some products can be prohibited for environmental, public health or food safety 
reasons. Although exporters' licences have been abolished, some products are subject to 
special export licences or certificates. In order to protect public health and the environment, the 
Dominican Republic prohibits the export of some products, including human blood and blood 
products, amber in its natural state, certain types of wood, and sand, gravel and soil suitable for 
cultivation. In accordance with its CITES commitments, the Dominican Republic bans the export 
of tortoiseshell in its natural raw state. Ecuador (2005) 
Ecuador has undertaken to apply export restrictions to certain products pursuant to the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna and the 
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their 
Disposal, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The 
exportation of roundwood is prohibited except in limited quantities for scientific and experimental 
purposes. The exportation of semi-finished forest products is authorized only when "domestic 
needs and the minimum levels of industrialization have been met. "  El Salvador 
(2003) In general, export prohibitions are applied in order to protect the environment or the cultural 
heritage or for economic reasons. At the end of 2002, the only prohibited exports were exports 
of plants and animals in danger of extinction, in accordance with the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and exports of gas for domestic 
consumption whose price is controlled on the internal market. Guyana 
(2009, 2003) A number of items are subject to export licensing including: poultry feed; rice bran; rice chips, 
rice dust, rice stock feed; wheat bran, wheat middlings, and wheat screenings; cane sugar in 
solid form; fertilizers; hides and skins; feathers, bird skins with feathers, prepared feathers,

species (green anoles, mabuyas, snails) may not be exported so as to protect the national 
heritage. The shipment of mangoes without proper fumigation treatment is also banned. Quality 
controls and phytosanitary and animal health measures also apply to exports of coffee, cacao, 
mangoes and animal products. TAD/TC/WP(2009)3/FINAL 45 Honduras

protection of crocodiles, shells and some live animals. Mexico (OECD) 
(2008) The export of some goods is prohibited, including certain products of animal origin, plants, 
narcotics and archaeological goods. This prohibition is based on the commitments in 
international agreements signed by Mexico, the control of dangerous substances, sanitary, 
phytosanitary and health reasons, and protection of the cultural and historical heritage. A prior 
export licence issued by the Ministry of Economy (SE) is required for the export of 16 tariff 
headings; the grounds for these licenses are the Mexican State's exclusive right to exploit and 
market non-renewable natural resources. Since the previous review, the number of HS 
headings subject to a prior licence has almost been halved from 28 headings. Nicaragua 
(2006) Nicaragua still bans export of the following: caoba roundwood (only the export of caoba in the 
form of sawn wood, plywood or veneered wood is allowed), spiny lobsters during their

(OECD) (2008, 
2006, 2004) The United States maintains export restrictions and controls for national security or foreign 
policy purpose, or to address shortages of scarce materials. Export controls can be based on 
US domestic legislation, policy decisions, UN resolutions or on US participation in four non-
binding export control regimes: the Wassenaar Arrangement, which deals with controls of 
conventional arms and dual-use exports, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Australia Group (AG, chemical and biological non-
proliferation). Uruguay
