			<front>BUSINESS REGISTRATION PILLARS: GOOD REGULATORY PRACTICE FOR ASEAN <lb/>By Zoe Dayan and Winona Rei Bolislis <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Business registration is crucial for ensuring accountable, transparent and viable business environments. <lb/>By bringing businesses into the formal economy, governments are able to provide more strategic and <lb/>targeted policies for businesses and consumers. The objective of this working paper is to look at the <lb/>importance of business registration for governments, businesses and citizens. It explores the this issue <lb/>through a series of case studies that support good practices in customer orientation and joined-up <lb/>government. Each of the different case studies fall under a pillar that aims to support countries in the <lb/>development of their business registration systems. <lb/>The paper also aims to provide policy directions for countries in Southeast Asia when developing <lb/>modern business registration systems and provides some background for the development of ASEAN&apos;s <lb/>regional business registration principles. <lb/>JEL classification: D01, D21, D22, D73, H1, H32, L2, M13, N85, N80 <lb/>Key Words: Business registration, business entry, Micro, Small and Medium Size Enterprises, one-<lb/>stop shops, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Administrative reform <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION -WHY CARE ABOUT BUSINESS ENTRY REGISTRATION? <lb/>Firm creation is important for GDP growth and jobs. But micro, small-and medium-sized enterprises <lb/>continue to start up and operate under sub-optimal conditions in economies around the world. Barriers <lb/>associated with registration, &apos;Entry barriers&apos;, are one of the early constraints that aspiring entrepreneurs <lb/>encounter while attempting to access the formal economy. <lb/>Why would a business register? <lb/>Registering a business provides it with formal protection of rights and removes the threat of penalties. <lb/>It should make it easier to trade and grow, for instance by improving access to credit (banks will rarely <lb/>lend to informal businesses) or government support. <lb/>Business registration, oftentimes in the form of incorporation, gives the business the characteristics of <lb/>a legal entity. It limits the liability of shareholders and reduces the transactions costs of organizing <lb/>commercial activity by giving the business a legal persona, providing assurance that contracts are <lb/>enforceable. The articles of association and any associated memorandum achieve this and establish limited <lb/>liability for company agents or entrepreneurs who engage in contracts on behalf of the company or <lb/>enterprise. These articles are filed in the registry and shield those acting on behalf of the company or <lb/>enterprise from personal liability. <lb/>Box 1. Registration reduces risk <lb/>In modern trade, transactions can be complex, involving dozens of steps and suppliers. The more complex and <lb/>the longer the time frame over which it occurs, the greater the risk. Registration can reduce that risk. <lb/>For example, an importer of agricultural products in one country wishes to place an order with an exporter in <lb/>another country, far away. Registration lets the importer find out that the company they are dealing with is in good <lb/>standing and that the counterpart in the company with which they are dealing has the legal authority to commit to an <lb/>export contract. <lb/>Each firm compares its perceived costs of being formal—including the burden of initial registration <lb/>and ongoing costs (e.g., tax payments, licensing, labour law)—with its perceived benefits of being formal <lb/>(e.g., access to larger contracts, banks, courts and government contracts, potential growth in productivity 1 , <lb/>reduced risk of fines and penalties). Businesses with larger efficient scales rationally register as they grow <lb/>large enough to benefit from the formal institutions. The majority of microenterprises in most developing <lb/>countries remain informal, despite more than a decade of reforms 2 aimed at making it easier and cheaper <lb/>for them to formalize, because of the lack of intention or interest to grow. What, therefore, are the elements <lb/>of business registration that can help motivate businesses to grow and why should this be important for <lb/>governments? <lb/></body>

			<body>Why governments want businesses to register? <lb/>Government wants new businesses to be created for many reasons. The effect of new business <lb/>formation is to increase economic growth 3 by fostering firm productivity 4 , increasing jobs 5 in the new and <lb/>incumbent businesses, and raising profitability by reducing the transaction costs of doing business. The <lb/>competition created lowers prices and drives innovation and technology adoption, creating a better range of <lb/>products for consumers. Registration enables businesses to link into regional and global supply chains, <lb/>with advantages of larger markets, access to finance and technology, and exposure to good business <lb/>practice and skills. <lb/>Good registration is also an important step in the broader promotion of an accountable, transparent, <lb/>efficient, and predictable regulatory business operating environment, often implemented by different <lb/>licensing and inspection authorities and tax and custom administrations. <lb/>Informal employment is positively correlated with poverty and low-level of development. 60-80% of <lb/>micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries are informal (IFC 2014). They are <lb/>typically three-person enterprises or smaller (McKenzie and Bruhn 2013). For instance, 90% of informal <lb/>firms in Sri Lanka are sole trader enterprises (De Mel et. al. 2013). In the 43 developing and transition <lb/>economies for which ILO data is available on the share of the workforce in informal sector enterprises, the <lb/>main job of a third (31%) of the non-agricultural workforce is in an informal sector enterprise 6 . In <lb/>Cambodia in 2013, under half of agro-enterprises had any degree of formality 7 . <lb/>Bringing businesses into the formal economy is an entry point for fair taxation, protection of <lb/>employees, other business licensing and investor protection (e.g. disqualification of insolvent directors, <lb/>share registration). Expanding the tax base allows government to pursue these and other policy objectives. <lb/>Registration also provides valuable data for policy development. <lb/>Conversely, excessively cumbersome regulation for start-ups is associated with higher levels of <lb/>corruption and informality 8 . There is also some evidence that FDI crowds out domestic investment in <lb/>countries with entry regulation cost above a certain level 9 . Making the business exit process more cost-<lb/>effective can also facilitate a more efficient allocation of capital and labour in different sectors. Job losses <lb/>due to failing firms should be outweighed by jobs created. <lb/> Lower barriers to start-up are associated with a smaller informal sector. <lb/> Lower costs of entry encourage entrepreneurship, enhance firm productivity and reduce <lb/>corruption. <lb/> Simple start-up translates into greater employment opportunities <lb/></body>

			<body>Reforms to increase registration <lb/>Starting up a business has usually involved 3 phases of interaction with regulatory requirements: <lb/> pre-registration – e.g. name check, prepare company statutes, deposit capital <lb/> registration – procedures at the registry and announcement <lb/> post-registration – e.g. acquiring company books and seal, registration with tax and labour <lb/>authorities, other permits/licenses and related inspections <lb/>Klapper and Love (2010) 10 find that a more than 40% reduction in procedures and 50% in costs and <lb/>time are needed to have a significantly increase registrations. Other studies show that these can increase <lb/>registration by up to 20%. Countries with weaker business environments require relatively larger reforms <lb/>in order increase registration. Multiple reforms make more impact. It is beneficial to make entry regulation <lb/>simple but it will not increase formal registration if tax rates or other regulations are onerous. 11 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Box 2. . Increasing registration by entry regulation reform in Portugal <lb/>In 2005 Portugal created its &apos;On the Spot Firm&apos; programme (Empresa na Hora). These were One Stop Shops <lb/>implementing simplified incorporation procedures (standard, pre-approved articles, pre-defined names and eliminated <lb/>registration of company books and public deeds) with significantly reduced administrative fees. <lb/>The time taken to register was reduced from several months to as little as 1 hour and the cost from EUR2000 to <lb/>under EUR400. Offices were opened across the country. At registration, the business received a corporate taxpayer <lb/>number, social security number, commercial registration and a declaration of business situation. <lb/>In the short run, there were increased registration of small business -(0-5 employees) by 17% and 7 new jobs <lb/>were created per 100,000 inhabitants. However, because of the reduction in costs, among the additional firms that <lb/>entered were more &apos;marginal&apos; businesses and were operated by entrepreneurs with limited experience and are using <lb/>lower types of technologies, which were then less likely to survive in the long run. <lb/>If barriers are reduced, then more marginal firms will register and an increased rate of failure should <lb/>be expected. Churn can be a measure of effective reallocation of resources in the economy. <lb/>Increased enforcement of rules can also drive up registration as the perceived costs of informality rise. <lb/>In Sri Lanka 12 in 2008, less than 0.5% of unregistered micro firms reported paying a fine, penalty or bribe <lb/>in the last year because of their unregistered status. Fewer than 10% reported interaction with officials at <lb/>all in the past year. In experiment, a small incentive dramatically increased registration rates. The most <lb/>common concerns were about becoming liable for tax and labour regulations, about which the owners <lb/>knew very little. For most, registration made no impact on their profitability (they were below the tax <lb/>threshold) or use of bank accounts or loans, participation in government programs or receipt of government <lb/>contracts. <lb/>Although there is a fiscal benefit from the registration of larger informal firms, it is unclear whether <lb/>there is a public rationale for attempting to formalize subsistence enterprises. <lb/>10 Klapper, Leora, and Inessa Love. 2010. &quot; The Impact of Business Environment Reforms on New Firm Registration. &quot; World Bank Policy <lb/>Research Working Paper No. 5493 <lb/>11 Evidence from Mexico, Entry Regulation and Business Start-ups, Kaplan, Piedra, Seira, WB Policy Research Working Paper 4322, Aug 2007) <lb/>12 The Demand for, and Consequences of Formalisation among informal Firms in Sri Lanka, Mel, McKenzie , Woodruff March 2012 AIZ DP <lb/>No.6442 <lb/></note>

			<body>What is a business register? <lb/>A registry is where the laws governing the formation of companies or enterprises, the creation and <lb/>enforcement of contracts and the formalization of collecting and storing of essential information on which <lb/>economic activity is based intersect. The register may also include non-incorporated businesses, such as <lb/>sole traders/proprietorships, partnerships or other legal forms. <lb/>A registry typically contains answers to questions such as, &apos;Who makes the decisions in a company or <lb/>enterprise and benefits from them?&apos; i.e. who are the shareholders, the directors and the beneficial owners, <lb/>&apos;Who has the legal authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the company or enterprise?&apos;, and &apos;At what <lb/>address should legal notices be served?&apos; <lb/>Specific national requirements vary considerably, reflecting the local legal and administrative context <lb/>(e.g. local/ national responsibilities), how far compliance is expected or approval required in advance. <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>I. GOOD PRACTICE IN CUSTOMER ORIENTATION <lb/>Customer orientation is an approach in which objectives are defined around satisfying the customers, <lb/>registering businesses, while achieving the policy objective of high registration compliance to enable <lb/>sustainable economic growth. <lb/>It means arranging processes around the needs of new businesses rather than the ease of existing <lb/>agency structures. Institutions, laws and procedures may all need to be changed to make the new processes <lb/>effective and efficient. Agencies will need to work with businesses and organisations skilled in business <lb/>support to understand what a business needs, when it needs it, and provide it in the way that is simplest and <lb/>cheapest for the business. <lb/>As a new business needs to interact with many areas of government policy – company law, taxation, <lb/>labour law and employee protection to name but a few, this means that many public laws and functions are <lb/>relevant. This goes far beyond the Ministry responsible for commerce and requires close interaction with <lb/>relevant ministries and stakeholders. It is undeniably difficult and risky to change everything at once. As a <lb/>result, most countries make improvements on a step-by-step basis. <lb/>Business should be able to expect: <lb/> a reduction or elimination of capital deposit requirements <lb/> a review of historical requirements <lb/> a goal-based approach to company or enterprise formation and termination, with simple standard <lb/>models <lb/> to eliminate duplication of information obligations <lb/> easy access to clear, accurate information about what is required <lb/> a simple and practical process to follow <lb/> transparent service standards (speed, timeliness, feedback and redress) <lb/> incentives aligned to promote compliance <lb/>The legal requirements for business registration come from company law. However, business <lb/>registration is not the only requirement before a company can legally operate. There are other registrations, <lb/>permits and licences required. Everything that the public sector requires before a business can legally <lb/>operate should be considered as part of the &apos;start-up&apos; process. <lb/>An effective and efficient process requires well designed laws and regulations, effective co-ordination <lb/>among national and regional agencies – with coherent policy objectives legal backing, clearly defined <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>responsibilities, adequate and well-trained registration, permit/licensing and enforcement resources and <lb/>effective consultation. <lb/>A dynamic approach should be adapted to improving systems over time, with reforms carried out in a <lb/>logical order and effectively evaluated. <lb/>Pillar 1: Minimise formal requirements <lb/>Reduce or eliminate capital requirements <lb/>Minimum capital requirements significantly slow entrepreneurship. 13 Such requirements also fail to <lb/>serve their intended purpose of protecting consumers and creditors from hastily established and potentially <lb/>insolvent firms 14 . In recent years many governments have stopped requiring new businesses to deposit <lb/>minimum capital in banks or with notaries before they can begin operations. As access to finance is <lb/>probably the largest barrier to MSME growth 15 , capital deposit requirements should be a priority. <lb/>Box 3. International elimination of minimum capital deposit requirements <lb/>The Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) has encouraged member states to <lb/>reduce their minimum capital requirements. Seven member states have already passed national legislation to this <lb/>effect in 2014/15, and were followed by six more in 2015/16. <lb/>In 2016, the government of Indonesia passed Government Regulation No. 7 of 2016, which abolished the <lb/>formerly imposed minimum capital requirement for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) previously amounting <lb/>to 31% income per capita. <lb/>Review historical requirements <lb/>When reviewing requirements, requirements that were obvious in the past can be reconsidered. For <lb/>instance, in an increasingly digital age, is a carved Company Seal really a necessity? Historically, common <lb/>seals were the standard means by which a company would execute documents and they had to be affixed to <lb/>deeds. In a world of electronically verified signatures, what role should they now play? Does anyone check <lb/>a seal now? <lb/>Box 4. Who uses a company seal? <lb/>Australia: The Company Law Review Act 1988 abolished the requirement for a company to have a seal, and the <lb/>need for documents to be executed under seal. <lb/>Hong Kong, China: The use of a common seal, or company seal, was made optional in starting a business <lb/>under the new Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622). A company can now execute a document either by signature or <lb/>using a common seal, at their discretion. <lb/>Cambodia: A seal is still required although the Law on Commercial Enterprises, Article 115 states, &apos;An <lb/>instrument or agreement executed on behalf of a company by a director, an officer or an agent of the company is not <lb/>invalid merely because a corporate seal is not affixed thereto. (Note: many legal and financial transactions in <lb/>Cambodia use a combination of signature with photocopy of ID card or thumbprint) <lb/></body>

			<body>Some countries still have a separate and relatively expensive step to check and reserve the proposed <lb/>company name. If the business register is open online, could the entrepreneur choose whether to check it or <lb/>get legal or other business service support to assure the name is within the rules? If a company or <lb/>enterprise can be registered immediately, what is the need for a name reservation period? <lb/>Box 5. Checking the name of a new business in the UK <lb/>The entrepreneur checks the name by themselves against the legal restrictions and the Companies House and <lb/>Trademark Registers. They may have to change the name if someone complains and Companies House agrees it&apos;s <lb/>&apos;too like&apos; a name registered before yours. Fewer than 10 cases per year are taken to the Company Names Tribunal. <lb/>A goal-based approach to company formation and termination, with simple standard models but <lb/>flexibility allowed if wanted <lb/>The needs of small company start-ups and big companies are different and the risks they pose can be <lb/>different too. The demands at registration should be the minimum needed to meet the relevant economic, <lb/>social and environmental requirements. The corporate registry typically contains answers to questions such <lb/>as, &apos;Who makes the decisions in a company and benefits from them?&apos; i.e. who are the shareholders and the <lb/>directors, &apos;Who has the legal authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the company?&apos;, and &apos;At what <lb/>address should legal notices be served?&apos; Especially for small companies, the use of this information should <lb/>be reviewed and the benefits of more extensive information assessed against the costs. An entrepreneur <lb/>may just want a simple clear requirement: &apos;Just tell me what to do&apos;. Model company statutes are able to <lb/>provide this. However, larger, more complex businesses value options for flexibility. <lb/>Box 6. UK Company Law reform: &apos;Think Small First&apos;-Some of the proposals for small businesses <lb/>Legislation should provide a self-contained statement of the law for the small and private companies. More <lb/>detailed provisions can be added for larger and public companies. <lb/> Simplify the law for private companies generally, by simplifying the model constitution, simplifying capital <lb/>maintenance rules, removing the requirement to have a company secretary <lb/> Simplify the law further for &quot; owner-managed &quot; companies (owners and directors are the same people) <lb/> Simpler forms of report and accounts <lb/>Exemption from audit for smallest companies. (Note: Latest review, after further modifications to the law, is that <lb/>up to 90% of eligible companies take advantage of this exemption, broadly in line with the RIA and it is a valuable <lb/>reduction in burden for small companies. The take-up of audit exemptions is generally lower for companies that <lb/>reported having shareholders, lenders and/or external investors, suggesting that these companies may undergo audits <lb/>to satisfy and provide confidence to these external parties.) <lb/>Source: Modern Company Law, a Consultation Document from the Company Law Review Steering Group, March 2000 <lb/>While the registration rationale is similar in all cases, in practice, the amount of information that they <lb/>contain and what is publicly available differs substantially between countries. Besides the basic <lb/>information -shareholders, directors, officers, and legal address, the law may also require the registry to <lb/>hold and make public the articles of association, financial accounts, and the capital structure, including the <lb/>types, numbers and rights of outstanding shares. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 7. Croatia – Simpler company form <lb/>A 2012 law allowed a new, simpler form of Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Croatia, which also required a <lb/>minimum capital of under $2 (cf $3,571 before). In the first 12 months, 8 407 simple LLCs were established and only 5 <lb/>488 of the old form were private LLCs. <lb/>The Simple LLC cannot have more than three members/shareholders and can only have one member on its <lb/>management. The simple company registration process is more user-friendly, via a prescribed form that needs to be <lb/>filled by a Public Notary, stating only the intention to form a company, the list of members, the list of persons <lb/>authorised to manage the company&apos;s business and acceptance of a member of the nomination to manage the <lb/>company. The form is signed by all members and lodged electronically with the business court registry. <lb/>Some jurisdictions, such as the UK, have allowed flexible entities. An objects clause was originally to <lb/>do with the state&apos;s granting of a concession for private individual to &apos;operate a trade&apos; and anything <lb/>contracted outside those objects was considered null and void. Under Companies Act 2006, Article 31: (1) <lb/>unless a company&apos;s articles specifically restrict the objects of the company, its objects are unrestricted. <lb/>This allows innovative business models to develop and companies to take advantage of opportunities. <lb/>These could range from the transformation of a manufacturing business into a service delivery business, a <lb/>restaurant developing its own farming or vocational training to a physical school turning into online <lb/>educational institutions. As technology enables faster change, this becomes more appropriate. It does make <lb/>it hard to use business registers to signpost other relevant licensing or permitting requirements but this is <lb/>rarely done anyway. It puts the onus back on the entrepreneur to check the regulations s/he is required to <lb/>follow. It is worth noting that companies still have to be classified by SIC code for statistical purposes. <lb/>Nonetheless, law in this area will continue to develop. For instance, due to concerns about illicit <lb/>domestic and cross-border money laundering and tax evasion, discussions from the June 2013 G8 summit <lb/>agreement ensured that companies should obtain and hold adequate, accurate, and up-to-date information <lb/>on their beneficial owners. There has been subsequent G20 and EU action and this information is starting <lb/>to be held in national registers. <lb/>Clear rules and procedures for the closure of a business are also vital for market efficiency and <lb/>confidence of investors and consumers. Attention to this area of law has tended to come after <lb/>simplification of start-up arrangements and the variation in any chosen measure tends to be wider. The <lb/>most significant issues are the cost – and how much of the value is lost in inefficient bankruptcy <lb/>procedures, time taken and then the priority of claims and extent of court involvement. In many countries, <lb/>the need to engage with the judicial system is a significant disincentive in seeking to recover money <lb/>through insolvency proceedings but the ability to resolve commercial disputes, of whatever kind, is very <lb/>important for a supportive business environment. <lb/>Table 1. 1 Comparison of ASEAN member state performance on insolvency measures <lb/>Brunei <lb/>Darussalam <lb/>Cambodia <lb/>Indonesia <lb/>Lao PDR <lb/>Malaysia <lb/>Myanmar <lb/>Philippines <lb/>Singapore <lb/>Thailand <lb/>Vietnam <lb/>Resolving insolvency Ease <lb/>of Doing Business ranking <lb/>57 <lb/>72 <lb/>76 <lb/>169 <lb/>46 <lb/>164 <lb/>56 <lb/>29 <lb/>23 <lb/>125 <lb/>Cents on the dollar <lb/>recovered in insolvency <lb/>47.2 <lb/>13.9 <lb/>29.9 <lb/>none <lb/>reported <lb/>81.3 <lb/>14.7 <lb/>21.3 <lb/>88.7 <lb/>67.7 <lb/>21.6 <lb/>Time taken to liquidate <lb/>after reorganisation <lb/>(years) <lb/>2.5 <lb/>6 <lb/>2 <lb/>none <lb/>reported <lb/>1 <lb/>5 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>5 <lb/></body>

			<body>Pillar 2: Elimination of multiple checks and validation in the process <lb/>To eliminate duplication of information obligations <lb/>Some countries put more emphasis on public officials ensuring that the information is accurate, while <lb/>others put the onus on the applicant, and manage complaints if they arise. It is important that the cost and <lb/>benefit to entrepreneurs, agencies, other businesses and the public are assessed; for example, name checks <lb/>and notarization. A notary public is an official witness to the free and willing signing of one or more <lb/>documents by one or more people whose identity the notary has verified. However, it plays a more limited <lb/>role in protecting the proponents by ensuring the legal form or articles are suitable. Systems which require <lb/>notarisation still often also require identity documents to be submitted for checking at registration. This <lb/>often shows that requiring information to be notarized can be an expensive process for small companies <lb/>and with limited benefits gained in the process. Nonetheless, as company law is clarified and documents <lb/>are standardised, the need for legal advice for simple company formation is reduced. <lb/>Box 8. Comparison of Company Memorandum and Articles of Association standardisation and notarisation <lb/>The Articles of Association (or incorporation) along with the memorandum of association (if required) are the <lb/>constitutional documents of a company. They set out the company&apos;s operating rules -the responsibilities of the <lb/>directors, the kind of business to be undertaken, and the means by which the shareholders exert control over the board <lb/>of directors. The Articles make the company a legal entity (legal personality). National rules vary: <lb/> <lb/>United Kingdom: At registration, companies are offered a standard (&apos;model&apos;) template for the Memorandum <lb/>and Articles of Association. If these are used, the company can be registered online directly. <lb/> <lb/>Myanmar: Applicant is given standard Memorandum and Articles when they reserve a company name. <lb/>These will have to be certified (stamped) for a fee. <lb/> <lb/>Singapore: Companies limited by guarantee and unlimited companies must register articles of association, <lb/>while for companies limited by shares, registration of articles is optional. If no articles are registered, <lb/>then Table A in the Fourth Schedule of the Companies Act will be applicable by default as the articles of the <lb/>company. In practice, companies tend to register their own customized versions of Table A. <lb/> <lb/>Indonesia: An applicant must arrange for a notary to obtain the standard form of the company deed and <lb/>notarize company documents <lb/> <lb/>Philippines: Articles of incorporation and treasurer&apos;s affidavit must be notarized. <lb/>Nonetheless, it is equally important to ensure that the data inserted in the company register are <lb/>verified and that, if automated, do not get corrupted. Simplification processes must therefore go in parallel <lb/>with the efficient co-ordination and integration of data across the different agencies. Administrative <lb/>simplification can contribute to reducing informality, but must also be supported by strong investment. <lb/>It is equally important to understand what is required from a business and to tailor-fit this in the <lb/>business registration system, For example, a more integrated system would ensure that businesses are able <lb/>to obtain authorization at once and minimise the need to provide information multiple times. <lb/>Easy access to clear, accurate information about what is required <lb/>How far should a potential business owner have to go to find out what they need to do to start up? The <lb/>information should be widely available and accurate. The internet is littered with sites with out-of-date <lb/>requirements that were not changed when the law was reformed. This is even more often true for the <lb/></body>

			<body>translations. How far are national languages and local institutions respected? This is the first stage of <lb/>making the regulatory process transparent. Involve businesses and experts in giving support to businesses <lb/>in preparing the material in a way that works best for new businesses. <lb/>A simple and practical process to follow <lb/>Regulatory and administrative procedures should be streamlined and transparent. There should be the <lb/>fewest sensible number of procedures required within a time frame e.g. only one at any time. Agencies <lb/>should work with representative groups to design the processes and make sure that feedback is asked for, <lb/>welcomed, and is used to make improvements. Best practice is to use impact assessment – with even <lb/>simple cost-benefit assessment – to assess the value of changes. The aim should be to minimise aggregate <lb/>regulatory burden in order to stimulate economic efficiency, while achieving intended benefits of the <lb/>regulation. Consider both types of cost: (1) actual cost of complying with the rules, such as hiring a notary <lb/>and (2) the administrative cost of dealing with the process, such as the time spent going to the agency <lb/>office or making five copies of the documents. Involving stakeholders in the process, and learning more <lb/>about their experiences, will help make these cost-benefit estimates more realistic. <lb/>It is also a good idea to check if the requirements are practical. For example, it would necessary to <lb/>ensure that certain requirements do not create a situation where a bank cannot open an account for a <lb/>business which is not in the registered but the law also requires evidence of a bank deposit before a <lb/>business could be registered. <lb/>Pillar 3: Commit to time frames <lb/>Transparent service standards (speed, timeliness, feedback and redress) <lb/>A way of driving improvement is to set measures for the standard of the service that can be expected, <lb/>and then to set targets and publish performance. <lb/>Speed is important for businesses. Agencies should set targets for maximum response and processing <lb/>times. If time limits are defined, then a decision is needed regarding what happens when the limit is <lb/>reached. A few jurisdictions have a &apos;Silence is Consent&apos; rule: if the deadline is passed without certification <lb/>or explicit objection, the business is automatically considered registered. This approach was pioneered in <lb/>Italy and currently enforced in Armenia, Georgia and Morocco 16 . An alternative is &apos;Silence is Negation&apos; <lb/>where the business can immediately appeal as it is assumed that the application has been rejected. <lb/>Table 2.1.

Examples of administrative appeals processes <lb/>WASHINGTON STATE <lb/>Reconsideration is used when you identify a mistake of law or fact made in the determination that could change <lb/>the result of your decision. This process is available for mainstream cases only. <lb/>When does a petition for reconsideration have to be made? <lb/>The written petition for reconsideration must be postmarked or delivered by the due date shown on the decision <lb/>(plus any extensions granted prior to the due date). <lb/>What happens if a petition for reconsideration is not filed on time? <lb/>When the petition for reconsideration is not filed on time, the decision becomes final. If you do not pay the <lb/>assessment by the due date, additional interest and penalties will accrue. <lb/>Can I request an extension for filing a petition for reconsideration? <lb/>Yes. An extension may be granted on the same grounds as other petitions. <lb/>What should I include in a petition for reconsideration? <lb/>A petition for reconsideration must identify specific mistakes in law or fact that requires reconsideration. If you fail <lb/>to specify mistakes of law or fact, your petition for reconsideration may be summarily dismissed without a hearing. <lb/>You must include any new documents and explanations with your petition for reconsideration. If your petition for <lb/>reconsideration is accepted, it will be assigned to the original TRO so that any errors in fact or law can be corrected <lb/>and new arguments and information addressed. <lb/>Will there be a reconsideration hearing? <lb/>Most petitions for reconsideration can be decided without a hearing. The TRO may decide to hold a <lb/>reconsideration hearing in some cases. <lb/>How will I be informed of the reconsideration decision? <lb/>The TRO will issue a written reconsideration decision and send it by regular US mail to you and your authorized <lb/>representative. <lb/>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS REGISTER <lb/>If you are not satisfied with a decision that has been made on behalf of the Registrar of the Australian Business <lb/>Register, please call our information line first so we can try to resolve the issue. If you are still not satisfied you have <lb/>the right to lodge an objection. You have 60 days from the date you received the decision to lodge an objection. <lb/>When we receive an objection, we review the facts and evidence you provide and come to a decision. We may <lb/>contact you or your representative to discuss your objection or request further information. We will let you know if your <lb/>objection will take longer than usual to decide (for example, because it raises complex matters). <lb/>Both these organisations have further appeals processes to the courts. <lb/>Pillar 4: Inform businesses of their rights <lb/>Incentives aligned to promote compliance <lb/>Despite the potential benefits, most businesses see registration, at best, as a necessary evil -something <lb/>they have to do before they can get on with their real activities. So as well as making it as simple as <lb/>possible, government should make sure that the incentives to comply are aligned as well. <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>Examples of relevant action could include additional start-up advice being offered alongside <lb/>registration or to newly registered businesses or tax breaks for small registered businesses. Enforcement <lb/>should be well targeted and supportive of compliance: registering a business must not be an opportunity for <lb/>rent-seeking behaviour by officials. If a level playing field is particularly important, such as of food outlets <lb/>for public health, then there should be compliance checks for all businesses operating in that field. <lb/>Box 10. Business registration compliance and enforcement thinking: <lb/>Some examples from Malaysia <lb/> <lb/>Links to support and advice. At incorporation, the business is automatically registered with specified <lb/>authorities and with the SME Corp. This is a network of &apos;one-stop centres&apos; for business advisory services, <lb/>relevant information on Government funds and incentives for SMEs, including tax incentives, and also <lb/>provides a channel for feedback on SME issues. <lb/> <lb/>Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM). SSM is a strong proponent of the philosophy of &quot; enforcement by <lb/>education &quot; . With the &apos;Balanced Enforcement&apos; approach, SSM believes that education complements the <lb/>effectiveness of enforcement initiatives in ensuring voluntary compliance. The Companies Commission of <lb/>Malaysia Training Academy (COMTRAC) was established in 2007 to educate stakeholders and strengthen <lb/>public awareness about the need, importance, and benefits of complying with corporate legal provisions. <lb/>Since implementing this approach, the compliance rate has improved from 40% in the early 2000s to 93% in <lb/>2016. <lb/> <lb/>Tax compliance. The approach includes an education and outreach programme (including one-stop service <lb/>counters at tax offices), verification (surveillance, public information gathering, cooperation with other <lb/>government agencies for data matching between asset acquisitions e.g. through stamp duty on property, <lb/>motor vehicle registrations and insurance) and tax payer database), and enforcement <lb/>Source: SME Corp and SSM websites, https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2013/asiatax/pdfs/malaysia1.pdf <lb/>Singapore uses the power of IT to generate and send reminders for Annual General Meetings and <lb/>annual returns to the businesses at its registered office address and to all officers of the business at their <lb/>residential address. If the deadline for filing the return is passed, the system will again generate reminders <lb/>to the business and its officers giving them a grace period to rectify the default. Once the grace period has <lb/>passed and the AR has not been filed, the records will be transmitted to the State Courts. <lb/>II. GOOD PRACTICE IN JOINED-UP GOVERNMENT <lb/>Pillar 5: Have a credible system for reviewing regulations <lb/>In the past when societal problems were less complex and information flowed more slowly, <lb/>governments could deal with matters in a &apos;top-down&apos;, hierarchical arrangement. However, with IT services <lb/>offering the possibility for more personalised and connected services, this approach no longer works so <lb/>well. Even an apparently simple issue, such as registering a company, is not usefully contained within <lb/>ministerial or agency boundaries. A business should not have to supply the same information to more than <lb/>one government body. <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>One term to capture this type of development is &apos;joined-up government&apos;. The New Labour <lb/>Government in Britain, in 1997, coined the term to mean enhancing coordination and integration within the <lb/>public sector. It was not only about removing organisational boundaries but also the need to align targets, <lb/>incentives (such as joint funding, pooled budgets and linking remuneration to joined-up targets), structures, <lb/>and cultures of authority in order to fit tasks that cross organisational boundaries. <lb/>Experience shows that this breaking of silos is the most difficult change management agenda of all. It <lb/>is common to create new structures and processes to oversee and account for the delivery of outcomes. <lb/>Such arrangements are usually needed both at the political level (such as cabinet sub-committees or <lb/>horizontal ministerial portfolios) and within the administrative system (such as cross-departmental working <lb/>groups or inter-agency task forces). In some cases, local or bottom-up cooperation is more innovative and <lb/>successful and has lessons to offer for any joined-up government initiative. Greater use of e-technology is <lb/>often part of the solution but it is far from the only approach that is needed. <lb/>Governments should: <lb/> make effective use of one-stop shops <lb/> ask for information only once <lb/> consider a unique business identifier <lb/> make appropriate use of ICT <lb/> provide appropriate protection for data <lb/> implement simple and transparent fees and payment systems <lb/> take the opportunity to reform business licensing too <lb/>Key features of the British initiative included new structures such as cross-departmental policy and <lb/>delivery units and the allocation of cross-cutting portfolios to ministers. In New Zealand, standardised <lb/>governance arrangements for public service agencies were introduced. In Australia, a number of one-stop-<lb/>shops were created at both federal and state level to provide easier citizen access to services. In Singapore, <lb/>successive e-government action plans provided the basis of greater service integration and accessibility. <lb/>Cross-agency project teams are now commonly used to tackle inter-agency matters and, through its use of <lb/>standards-based infrastructure, application services and supporting processes and procedures, Singapore <lb/>has emerged as one of the world leaders in e-services. <lb/>Many countries often work within silos within and across institutions that are responsible for business <lb/>registration. This therefore makes it challenging to bring together like-minded institutions to adopt <lb/>meaningful changes in business registration practices. Performance management and incentive systems can <lb/>play a role in influencing institutional behaviour to shift from silo and vertical administration to horizontal <lb/>governance to further promote good business registration practices. <lb/>However, there are also many examples of failures in joined-up government initiatives, particularly in <lb/>the area of e-government and the use of IT to integrate services. Based on international experience, a <lb/>number of common critical success factors towards achieving joined-up government can be identified. <lb/>These include: (1) the identification of clear objectives and political commitment; (2) the existence of <lb/>viable structures (particularly at lower levels of government); and (3) the allocation of an appropriate <lb/>budget and the alignment of that budget with joined-up goals and clear accountability lines. For public <lb/></body>

			<body>servants used to working in discrete parts of the public sector, engaging in substantive joined-up <lb/>government work requires emphasis on particular values including collaboration, integration, innovation, <lb/>risk-taking and flexibility. <lb/>Make effective use of one-stop shops <lb/>The one-stop-shop concept is the arrangement of functions together for the convenience of the <lb/>customer, in the way a mall or supermarket/hypermarket does for a shopper. The one-stop shop can be <lb/>physical or online, provide only information or also used for transactional processes. At best, a business <lb/>can be set up in a single visit and with a single (affordable) payment. <lb/>In reality there is a continuum of varieties of one-stop shop, from a single door with information <lb/>board into separate agency functions to a single desk dealing with all functions, a single visit or single <lb/>interaction online platform, and single payment points. <lb/>In the past, in many civil law countries, notaries coordinated company start-up procedures, effectively <lb/>compensating for the failure of various government offices to work together. For the entrepreneur, the <lb/>notary was the one-stop shop. Some bodies, which have become known as &apos;one more stop shops&apos; are there <lb/>simply to co-ordinate the activities of other agencies on behalf of the entrepreneur – they are additional <lb/>administrative step but at least it&apos;s a single, hopefully friendly face to deal with. <lb/>Several countries, including Colombia, Portugal, and Estonia, have concluded that, for <lb/>straightforward incorporations, a notary is not necessary. In Belgium, Italy, and Spain notaries have <lb/>become key intermediaries for electronic filing. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, company <lb/>incorporation agents have for many years been active as &quot; one-stop shop &quot; intermediaries and are finding a <lb/>new role in connection with electronic filing, but there is no obligation to use their services. <lb/>The first inter-agency coordination is usually between business registration and basic business tax <lb/>registration. Both agencies can often see the links and the potential for simplification. The next most <lb/>common registrations are for labour requirements but these are much more rarely included. European <lb/>experience is that it can be very difficult for other agencies to see how they benefit from the one-stop shop <lb/>and the lead agency has often had little or no contact with them before, making communication harder still. <lb/>The Albanian National Registration Centre is one of the few examples where investors can complete all the <lb/>procedures for business registration, registration for health insurance, social insurance and labour <lb/>directorate registration, with a single application. But they must then register separately at the Municipality <lb/>Bureau of Internal Revenue. Benin established a One-stop shop, Guichet Unique de Formalisation des <lb/>Entreprises (GUFE), as a single access point to post-registration requirements -tax declaration, application <lb/>for import and export licences, tradesman card, registration with ministry of trade and affiliation with <lb/>Social Security Office. Only later did the commercial registry join, for approval of incorporation <lb/>documents. <lb/>Box 11. Singapore – OneStopShop@ACRA, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority <lb/>A new business registers with ACRA and is then given the option to register for one of the following services: <lb/>Domain Name Reservation <lb/>Open Bank Account <lb/>Register for Goods and Services Tax <lb/>Activate Customs Account <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>Subscribe to free e-newsletter <lb/>Sign up for GeBiz Alerts <lb/>All the above services are managed by other agencies. If the applicant signs up for any of them, the details are <lb/>sent by ACRA to the relevant agency. <lb/>Few governments have tried to combine regulatory requirements and other MSME business support <lb/>activity in their one-stop shops. Australia has adopted a single portal approach -business.gov.au -for all <lb/>government information, transactions and services. It is marketed as a whole-of-government service <lb/>providing essential information on planning, starting, running and selling or closing a business, as well as <lb/>access to business compliance requirements. The Philippines Negosyo centres are another rare example, <lb/>aiming to provide business registration assistance, business advisory services, and business information <lb/>and advocacy. <lb/>How well do one-stop shops deal with local registration and other regulatory requirements? <lb/>Box 12. Finding out about local requirements for a business <lb/>In the USA, Business licenses and permit are found at every level of government (federal, state, region, county, <lb/>city). administrations seem largely to have made use of on-line portals to help businesses establish the nature and <lb/>scope of required permits and other requirements. The U.S. Small Business Administration provides a &quot; Business <lb/>Licenses and Permits tool &quot; which helps business identify the licenses and permits that they require and provides links <lb/>to web pages, application forms and instructions. The tool also includes links to portals for each of the fifty states. <lb/>In Australia, the Business License &amp; Information Service (ABLIS) provides location-specific information on <lb/>required state licenses and permits. <lb/>Most businesses require some form of local -municipal/regional/provincial -registration but <lb/>decentralization, deconcentration and devolution have often created cultural and technical barriers to <lb/>making these links. <lb/>The largest attempts to achieve this are the European Points of Single Contact which will be discussed <lb/>later. <lb/>Provide information once only <lb/>A business should not have to supply the same information to more than one government body. As <lb/>well as being a waste of time, it makes data entry errors far more likely and failure to update information in <lb/>all systems almost inevitable. Enabling a single data provision requires cooperation between agencies, at <lb/>the least making them share data. Further developments range from consolidating registrations into a single <lb/>application to interconnecting databases or registries. <lb/>In 2016, it was reported that over 80% of corporate registries share info with other public agencies <lb/>and over 50% take information from other agencies, for instance, sharing registration with tax authority or <lb/>checking IDs. <lb/>For example, from 1 May 2015, India reduced the number of forms required to incorporate and start a <lb/>business to just one, INC-29. Until then, it had required a minimum of 8 forms with much duplication of <lb/>the information, including one each for a digital signature certificate, approval of the company name, <lb/>registration of the memorandum and articles of the company, approval of the registered office and a <lb/>separate form for every director. <lb/></body>

For instance in <lb/>New Zealand, 19 percent of actively trading businesses in New Zealand are sole traders, 15 percent are <lb/>trusts, and 12 percent are partnerships. A further four percent of entities that are not businesses in the <lb/>traditional sense undertake business activity, such as government agencies and the not-for-profit sector. <lb/>The full benefits (network effects) of the NZBN to the wider economy depend on all of these having an <lb/>NZBN. <lb/>Box 14. New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) <lb/>NZBN is a universal identifier which will enable businesses to easily update, share key information and interact <lb/>with each other and the public sector. NZBN has been introduced to streamline all essential business information, and <lb/>over time will become the only number businesses will need to use to interact with a range of other businesses and <lb/>government agencies. Both registered and unincorporated businesses may have an NZBN. <lb/>Government agencies will progressively recognise businesses by their NZBN. Linking information between these <lb/>agencies and businesses will also lead to improved data quality and reduced rework. Concerns raised during <lb/>consultation focused on maximising the benefits of the NZBN, while protecting the privacy of individuals in business, <lb/>such as sole traders. <lb/>The success of the NZBN depends on rapid uptake of the number by businesses and state sector agencies. This <lb/>is needed to build momentum for infrastructure development and private investment in commercial opportunities. <lb/>Otherwise it becomes another number, rather than the intended replacement for the many current identifiers. <lb/>Source: Cabinet Circular CO (16) 3 to all Departments, Ministerial Direction to Crown Entities issued under Section 107 of the <lb/></body>

			<body>Crown Entities Act 2004, NZBN regulatory impact statement, May 2014 <lb/>Pillar 7: Make effective use of ICT <lb/>There is ever-increasing use of computer systems for managing corporate registration systems, for <lb/>back office data storage, for giving information, to allow documents to be sent and finally to enable online <lb/>registration. Streamlining registries and databases offers faster processing and helps to meet growing <lb/>demands for company information within government for reduction of duplication and regulatory <lb/>oversight. It improves data integrity by reducing reduce the number of times information has to be given. It <lb/>can improve access for firms operating at a distance from registrar&apos;s offices and application forms can even <lb/>be pre-filled with information already held on other government systems. <lb/>But all too often, even sites that work are not user-friendly. Operators and applicants need to be able <lb/>to find simple information about what they have to do, save their application part-way through, have access <lb/>to help to complete any forms or attach or retrieve documents and so on. Even navigating around the <lb/>system has to be carefully thought through e.g. the Bulgarian Point of Single Contact has an A-Z search <lb/>facility, but licensing is under &apos;A&apos; for &apos;Application for …&apos; rather than the activity that the licence covers. <lb/>Box 15. E-enabling changes in corporate registries in 2015 <lb/>Albania introduced electronic signature for the first time. <lb/>Arizona, USA implemented online LLC formation. <lb/>Brazil (Alagoas Maceio) introduced a digital registry for sole traders. <lb/>Colombia implemented e-filing for incorporation and changes. <lb/>Denmark implemented a brand new digital registration solution that increases quality of registration. It enables <lb/>automatic checks and facilitates users to do additional types of registrations online. <lb/>Gibraltar introduced electronic consultation, electronic archive and electronic filing on essential documents. <lb/>Hong Kong launched a full-scale electronic filing service, covering all specified forms. The registration process can be <lb/>completed in less than 24 hours for specified forms that are submitted electronically and processed automatically. <lb/>In Ireland, since June 2015, registration of charges (mortgages-security interests) can only be completed <lb/>electronically. <lb/>Macedonia (The Former Yugoslav Republic) introduced electronic filing of changes. <lb/>Norway extended the scope of the types of applications that are processed electronically and automatically by the <lb/>business register. Automated procedures include several types of notifications to the register, such as change of <lb/>business address, email address, mailing address, auditor, CEO and a few more. In addition to this, they have <lb/>introduced a full electronic to enable the whole process, from incorporation to registration of the limited liability <lb/>company, to be done electronically. <lb/>Israel launched a web system for electronic filing of applications for registration of companies and changes to <lb/>company information. <lb/>Mongolia updated their law governing the web-based entity registration. <lb/>Qatar recently launched an e-service portal. <lb/>Spain introduced new legal provisions making e-filing of accounts mandatory and governing electronic <lb/>documents for the registration of sole traders with limited liability. <lb/></body>

			<body>Business registries are generally leading the way in these e-enabled registry solutions, with the <lb/>pressure and support from large companies to help them deliver improvements. But, as every organisation <lb/>knows, getting IT systems to work sounds easier than it is in reality. Although data is limited, survey and <lb/>poll results about e-government initiatives in developing/transitional countries show that 35% are total <lb/>failures, 50% are partial failures and only 15% are successful 17 . Even in highly developed economies, IT <lb/>projects rightfully have poor reputations. <lb/>Box 16. Austria – implementation of web portal for business registration <lb/>In Austria, www.usp.gv.at is estimated to have reduced companies&apos; costs by €100 -€300 million. The site&apos;s <lb/>success since launch has been seen in significant user growth. <lb/>The portal has, at the same time, been a medium for administrative reform, in particular improvement of <lb/>processes and the elimination of multiple notifications. <lb/>Further benefits have been better data quality, and reduced maintenance and set-up costs for new e-Gov <lb/>applications, with savings of up to €20 million expected by 2016. <lb/>Use of www.usp.gv.at : <lb/>2010 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>User sessions <lb/>363 783 <lb/>489 606 <lb/>586 477 <lb/>1 286 405 <lb/>Annual growth (%) <lb/>35% <lb/>20% <lb/>119% <lb/>Unique clients <lb/>281 289 <lb/>449 575 <lb/>511 486 <lb/>753 460 <lb/>Annual growth (%) <lb/>60% <lb/>14% <lb/>47% <lb/>The success of the Austrian site is seen as a function of its speed and relevance, which resulted from: <lb/> Involving senior politicians and administrators from the very start to ensure project support; <lb/> Putting in place an appropriate legal framework to support the e-Gov project; <lb/> Recognising that organisational and legal aspects can be more challenging than technical <lb/>problems – and planning accordingly; <lb/> Co-operating with a wide range of business-related partners to ensure a high quality of <lb/>information; and <lb/> Ensuring collaboration across government (federal and regional), and recognising this takes time. <lb/>As well as the need to simplify the process and authorisations before bringing specifying an online <lb/>process, the computer and e-infrastructure has to be reliable, sufficient trained and competent staff <lb/>available and the applicants need support. In developing economies, where rural systems may still, or until <lb/>recently have been, paper based, these changes are significant. There is also a more fundamental question, <lb/>particularly in developing economies, about access to online systems. While mobile penetration is growing <lb/>dramatically, this doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that even tech-savvy entrepreneurs have computer screen <lb/>access. Can the portals be truly responsive (mobile-friendly) and is the support available compatible with <lb/>using the same device to fill in the form? <lb/></body>

			<body>Provide appropriate protection of data <lb/>Particularly when systems are being brought online, issues of data protection and the risks of identity <lb/>theft have to be considered. Most registry applications require at least a username and password and the <lb/>option of automatic notification, if registration details are changed. Within the EU, 17 Member States have <lb/>stronger electronic identification (eID) systems but cross-border recognition remains to be seen. <lb/>Box 17. eID implementation for businesses in Denmark <lb/>NemID consists of a user ID, password, and a keycard with &quot; keys &quot; (time codes). When an employee logs on, they <lb/>must enter their user ID and password and the code from the keycard. This indicates they are authorized to contact <lb/>public authorities, access secure portals and data and sign documents on behalf of the business. <lb/>A business may request up to 3 free NemID signatures for its employees. <lb/>Enable online applications <lb/>In addition, a problem with all these automated processes is the verification of signatures. We <lb/>discussed earlier some of the issues with notarisation of signatures on company documents. The use of <lb/>electronic communication presents further challenges. The acceptance of records of approval reduces <lb/>markedly along the spectrum from pen and paper, through photograph, fax and scan to digital and e-<lb/>signatures. <lb/>In ASEAN alone, the full spectrum of forms is used. In Cambodia, many legal documents are still <lb/>signed by thumbprint which is perceived as more secure than a written signature and is often accompanied <lb/>by photocopy of the individual&apos;s ID card. Scans of original documents are not widely accepted although it <lb/>is probably legally enforceable. However, in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, a digital signature is <lb/>accepted while Singapore has recently adopted the use of e-signature. <lb/>In a similar way that requiring bank transfer for fee payment would increase the number of businesses <lb/>with a bank account or perhaps create a barrier to registration, the acceptance and use of the next form of <lb/>signature approval along the spectrum could incentivise its recognition in general commerce. <lb/>Box 18. &apos;e-signature&apos; systems <lb/>Electronic signature <lb/>An electronic signature is, like its paper equivalent, a legal concept adopted by a person with the intent to sign a <lb/>record. An electronic signature can be broken down into these components: <lb/> A method of signing <lb/> Data authentication <lb/> User authentication <lb/> Capture of intent <lb/>Digital Signature <lb/>A digital signature refers only to the encryption / decryption technology on which an electronic signature solution <lb/>is built. Digital signature encryption secures the data associated with a signed document and helps verify the <lb/>authenticity of a signed record. Used alone, it cannot capture a person&apos;s intent to sign a document or be legally bound <lb/></body>

			<body>to an agreement or contract. <lb/>Implement simple and transparent fees and payment systems <lb/>Best practice is for all types of public sector registration and permit/license requirements to be <lb/>available at a flat fee, set simply to cover processing and any related costs, such as mandatory publication <lb/>of information. Some countries have chosen, for a time, to incentivise business registration by making it <lb/>free. This helps reduce the costs of entry but is not sustainable. Roughly 50% of corporate registries <lb/>globally are fully funded by fees collected while the rest receive government support or funding. <lb/>Box 19. Companies House – example fees and payments (1) <lb/>Company registration <lb/> Online (using standard articles): £12, payable by debit, credit card, or PayPal. <lb/> By post: £40, payable by cheque. <lb/> Same day registration: £100. Get application at Companies House by 3pm. <lb/>Note: All Companies House fees are set by regulation, fees shown are as of February 2016. <lb/>Requiring fee payment through a bank can encourage the commercial use of banking and reduce the <lb/>opportunity for informal payments. However, across many countries, a significant proportion of the <lb/>population is unbanked, including entrepreneurs. This means that it is probably too early to mandate <lb/>payment by bank transfer. The local context must be taken into account when checking whether sufficient <lb/>branches are available to make this practical, or whether, for instance, MFI should become involved. <lb/>Governments are starting to consider single payment points for individual and business interaction <lb/>with government. Drivers range from convenience and efficiency to transparency and reducing the <lb/>opportunity for corruption. <lb/>Box 20. Canberra, Australia: Framework for the payment of ACT Government bills <lb/>The objective is to accelerate business engagement with the digital economy, help businesses access new <lb/>customers and markets and to continue to remove red tape. <lb/>It will provide: <lb/>a) Consistency in service offering – progressively standardising the suite of payment services and bill <lb/>presentation across government, while taking into account the limitations of the current systems and the needs of <lb/>specific business or regulatory processes <lb/>b) Facilitate a staged approach to electronic notification and presentment of bills to the community <lb/>c) Implement strategies to further promote electronic payment to government. <lb/>The key principles for the policy are: <lb/>a) Cost effective for government – direct transactional costs (bank fees, payment infrastructure etc) must be as <lb/>cost effective as possible given the transaction value and volume <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>b) Process efficient – downstream processing costs (impact on other parts of government etc) must be as <lb/>efficient as possible <lb/>c) Customer convenience – simple and cost effective options for the customer <lb/>d) Digital first – new services must be designed with a digital payment solution foremost allowing customer choice <lb/>of digital service <lb/>e) Adaptable – payment methods that are flexible, ensure fit for purpose while able to adapt to emerging payment <lb/>trends and facilities. <lb/>Source: ACT Government Bill Payment Policy 2015 <lb/>Box 21. GOV.UK Pay <lb/>The objective is a uniform payments platform to allow government bodies to improve the way they reconcile <lb/>payments across multiple payment methods, such as debit cards, credit cards and digital wallets. <lb/>The UK government knows that a cross-government platform cannot be developed in isolation. It needs <lb/>collaboration, business process analysis, and lots of user research. The discussions have already taken place with <lb/>many colleagues across government to find out how they currently take payments and how that could be improved. <lb/>That research is being intensified and is focussing on taking credit and debit card payments for some online <lb/>transactions of the first partners: Companies House, Environment Agency, Home Office and Ministry of Justice. <lb/>An important way in which corporate registration enables the economy is by reducing the risk of <lb/>business-business transactions by allowing the contracting partners to know that each other are legal and <lb/>currently active and solvent. This information is a type of public good (the value and availability is not <lb/>reduced by use) and is usually provided free. It should be highly accessible. More detailed data is often <lb/>legally accessible but charged for. Other permits and licences are also often displayed at the business <lb/>premises but less often accessible online. <lb/>Box 22. Companies House – example fees and payments (2) <lb/>Information services <lb/> Online search of all public data held on companies – free of charge e.g. basic company information and <lb/>status, nature of business, date of last and next accounts, full transaction filing, mortgage charge data and <lb/>disqualified directors details <lb/> Search company information using WebCHeck – basic information free, £1 per document image <lb/> Companies House Direct subscription service – access to all 130million documents held, going back 20 <lb/>years. Subscription £4 per month and £1 per document image <lb/> Historical company records, document packages, company reports and appointments and detailed <lb/>mortgage information.

			<body>Pillar 8: Take the opportunity for business licensing reform <lb/>This can be a significant regulatory reform project in its own right and is often more politically <lb/>sensitive than other business registration reform, because the costs and benefits are more distributed. It <lb/>must be undertaken within the national contexts of de-concentration and de-centralisation. For many <lb/>countries, even the first step of collating current requirements will be difficult in itself. Small business <lb/>representative organisations should be involved as well as business support intermediaries. <lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>III. FEATURES OF A MODERN NATIONAL BUSINESS REGISTRATION SYSTEM <lb/>Starting or formalising a business should appear to the business, so far as possible, as a single step. It <lb/>is the public sector&apos;s responsibility to make the connections to different agencies work behind the scenes. <lb/>Company law should offer simple legal forms for businesses with standard or model templates, capital <lb/>deposit requirements reduced or eliminated, and the need for the use of intermediaries, such as notaries, <lb/>removed. There must be clear decisions on whether micro-enterprises, sole traders and other non-<lb/>incorporated businesses should be included in the register: a single register may be simpler to maintain. It <lb/>is best practice for registration to be an administrative not judicial process. <lb/>The process should be simple for the applicant. Best practice is to manage this through accessible one-<lb/>stop shops, including virtual presence, with clear inter-agency commitments, funding and performance <lb/>targets. These services could be provided by a government agency or could also be sub-contracted out. <lb/>They should provide clear information on all registration and common licensing/permitting requirements. <lb/>Any need for rare and highly specialised assessment e.g. major hazard installations and sources of non-<lb/>standard support, such as sector-specific grants, should be signposted. The interface should be developed <lb/>and improved in collaboration with business representative groups and using the skills of those who <lb/>regularly provide support to start-ups. <lb/>There should be no duplication of information requests and a single application form should be used <lb/>where possible, with requirements only separated if there is a clear reason to do so, e.g. if VAT registration <lb/>is not required until after many months of trading. <lb/>An online process should be available but, recognising local contexts, probably a paper and face-to-<lb/>face option too available reasonable locally, with support on request in all cases so that forms can be <lb/>completed correctly first time. ASEAN has a young demographic, some with high IT skills, alongside a <lb/>sometimes less literate older generation and incomplete infrastructure including electrification. For <lb/>example, while there is high mobile penetration, computer access is more limited. Only 40% of the <lb/>population have internet access 18 . <lb/>There should be transparent service standards, mechanisms for feedback and redress and a minimum <lb/>flat fee – set to cover only processing costs and transferrable electronically. <lb/>Government should move towards a unique business identifier for all interaction with public agencies, <lb/>national and local, and consider the development of a single payment point to government. <lb/>Many of these elements, such as accepting online communication, shared data access and single <lb/>application forms, will require legislation. <lb/>Enforcement should be designed to support business growth while achieving compliance. The public <lb/>sector must consider who should have access to which parts of the information, for each agency, and how <lb/>to maintain data protection while allowing suitable transparency and search. For instance, for the business <lb/>registry, government will want to enable domestic companies to join global value chains. Allowing easy <lb/>access to trustworthy registry information enables due diligence processes by larger players in the supply <lb/>chain, reducing the risk for them of contracting with local companies. <lb/></body>

			<body>Challenges and policy recommendations for ASEAN <lb/>ASEAN is committed to streamlining business permit and registration, to enable less costly and faster <lb/>business formation. The Strategic Action Plan for SME Development 2016-2025 includes the <lb/>establishment of one-stop shops, benchmarking for registration and obtaining construction permits and <lb/>registering property and improving the capacity of policy makers to design, simplify and implement such <lb/>systems. <lb/>POLICY RECOMMENDATION 1: Simplify legal company forms and requirements, such as capital <lb/>deposit <lb/>There are opportunities for simplification in company forms and requirements in some ASEAN <lb/>countries. <lb/>This is a regulatory simplification process. There is good practice to follow, with impact assessment <lb/>and cost-benefit calculation advice available. Both compliance costs and administrative costs should be <lb/>considered, although the one-stop shop steps below will add to the administrative burden reduction. The <lb/>priorities should be: <lb/>1.1 Minimise remaining capital deposit requirements <lb/>1.2 Offer a simple limited liability company form, with model company documents and minimum <lb/>necessary requirements for registration. Revisit the rationale and benefits and costs of notarisation. <lb/>1.3 Reconsider the need for other elements such as the company seal or certified invoices. <lb/></body>

The average time needed, over 30 days, is skewed by outliers but there is room for improvement <lb/>across the board. <lb/>Bring together a team, with effective representatives from the agencies involved and very preferably <lb/>the private sector, especially small businesses. Evaluate how well agency-business interaction is working. <lb/>2.1 Map the processes. Start by finding out what is really happening now. Detailed mapping of <lb/>procedures invariably yields surprises and opportunities for improvement. <lb/>2.2 Simplify individual procedures and reassess whether they can be completed in parallel. Is it <lb/>necessary to ask for certain checks before the next step can be taken e.g. authorisation to print invoices <lb/>and receipts by specified printer then bring them back for stamping?. Use simple RIA, at least calculating <lb/>the administrative burden cost compared with any evidence of real benefit. How will data be keep up to <lb/>date? <lb/>2.3 Set a common approach to fees across different procedures. Are fees going to be flat rate and <lb/>set to recover costs? How will this be measured? Will offices handle cash? Government may want to <lb/>encourage banking but this will be a barrier for some. According to KPMG, in 2016, only 27% of <lb/>Southeast Asia&apos;s population have a bank account. In Cambodia, for instance, this number is 5% 19 . <lb/>2.4 Establish a single business register for all types of enterprises. If possible, countries should <lb/>look into the possibility of establishing a single business register for all business enterprises, which can be <lb/>carried out in the process when adopting a one-stop shop approach (see policy recommendation 3). Once <lb/>properly set and managed, this basic infrastructure has the potential to produce positive spill-over effects <lb/>in statistical data collection, information for credit bureaus, legal documentation, etc. <lb/>POLICY RECOMMENDATION 3: Build on the one-stop shop approach <lb/>Build on the existing the one-stop shop approach – do not create another body 20 . The national one-<lb/>stop shops of the ASEAN Strategic Action Plan for SME Development are realistic and yet will be a <lb/>major challenge for all member states to achieve across all locations. The barriers include infrastructure – <lb/>such as electrification, civil service capacity and co-operation between ministries and local <lb/>governments/authorities. ASEAN should consider surveying MSMEs about the barriers they face, or <lb/>working with the World Bank Entrepreneurship/Enterprise Surveys, for instance, to explore more detail <lb/>across the region. Note that successful improvements elsewhere have been developed and implemented <lb/>step by step. <lb/>Again, a team is essential, with effective representatives from the agencies involved and preferably <lb/>the private sector, especially small businesses. Evaluate how well existing one-stop shops are doing. <lb/>3.1 Decide which processes to include first. Most ASEAN countries have started by integrating <lb/>elements of tax registration into the business registry process. The next sizeable elements are labour <lb/>requirements e.g. social security. Can there be a single form? Can the business have common number for <lb/>the registrations – this could be a first step towards a unique business identifier? <lb/></body>

Will offices be under national or sub-national control? <lb/>3.4 How does the business get information about what they need to do? At the One Stop Shop, <lb/>online or from other lcoations? <lb/>3.5 Can the business deal with just one person. Can they get help with filling in the form(s)? <lb/>3.6 Set service standards. Set targets and establish monitoring needs. Make sure that it is possible <lb/>for businesses to give feedback and that there is a procedure for this to be meaningfully dealt with. <lb/>3.7 Specify any computer system. Who will enter the data? Can the information be shared <lb/>electronically with other organisations; consider data security and future interconnection needs. <lb/>3.8 Will there be an online filing option?

			<body>IV. DRIVERS OF A MODERN REGIONAL BUSINESS REGISTRATION SYSTEM <lb/>When governments commit to integrating their economic development to achieve growth, they want <lb/>to improve market efficiency. Regulatory heterogeneity or administrative barriers should not prevent <lb/>companies from establishing themselves in the territory of other Member States. Cross-border trade has <lb/>traditionally been the first area of cooperation. Regional free trade areas and customs unions have preceded <lb/>economic integration and states have developed mechanisms for working together by creating systems to <lb/>support these. <lb/>An internal market is enabled by a degree of regulatory cooperation, based on the establishment of <lb/>common regulatory goals and principles, taking into account the current policies and regulations in place, <lb/>and the challenges faced by the different countries. The experience is that managing structures to resolve <lb/>issues of harmonisation and create common approaches is not easy. <lb/>The kind of issues that need to be addressed for regional business registration include key issues of <lb/>company law such as company formation requirements and procedures, corporate governance, capital <lb/>maintenance, mergers and acquisitions, accounting and audit, and market regulation 21 . After 10 years, EU <lb/>member states are still struggling to implement achieve this. It requires excellent interconnection between <lb/>national and local systems. Even at a less complex level, for example, few EU corporate registries have <lb/>information or search functions in other languages, only about 50% will accept foreign language <lb/>Memoranda and Articles, etc. even with certified translation and many have difficulties recognising foreign <lb/>mobile numbers and bank account details. <lb/>Box 23. A decade for the EU to make an interconnected regional business registry <lb/>2009: Directive 2009/01 – required certified copies of filings to be available electronically <lb/>2012: amended Directive 2012/17 – required Business Registries Interconnection System (BRIS) to be established. <lb/>2015: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/884 -technical specifications and procedures <lb/>2016: call for funding in 2016 for back-office but not national Access Points (18 month project) <lb/>2019: BRIS should be running, at least the back office <lb/>For a competitive internal market, information must also flow freely. Useful business registration <lb/>information includes business existence, insolvency, ownership, disqualification of directors. At the larger <lb/>end of the commercial spectrum, cross-border takeovers, mergers and restructuring need to be recognised. <lb/>It is also valuable to know when a business is just a branch from another jurisdiction – a subsidiary, not a <lb/>separate legal entity. It is very common, across countries, to register these and most regimes give them a <lb/>number. However, very few have yet managed to link this to their home registry number, which would <lb/>help to keep the information up to date if the parent status changes. ASEAN is considering the benefits of <lb/></body>

			<body>harmonization of information requirements for the establishment of companies and the creation of an <lb/>official company register accessible by all Member States 22 . <lb/>As covered earlier, business registration goes far beyond the initial corporate registration. To start <lb/>operating in most jurisdictions, businesses require a host of other permissions, from requirements to do <lb/>with employing people to sector-specific protections for issues such as health and safety or professional <lb/>licenses to operate. <lb/>The EU Services Directive mandated that Member States must make easily accessible through the <lb/> &quot; Points of Single Contact &quot; for an individual or business in another member state to find out about the rules, <lb/>regulations and formalities that apply to service activities and to complete the administrative procedures <lb/>online. The PSCs are like a virtual one-stop shop, with national counters. In addition, it also requires <lb/>creating a network among regulatory and supervisory authorities. <lb/>Progress of the EU Points of Single Contact <lb/>Source: Performance of the Points of Single Contact. Final report for DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs 2015 <lb/>This was far more than an IT project to e-link national services. Establishing a regional system <lb/>replicates all the difficulties of creating an integrated national one -financial, political, legal, technical <lb/>inter-operability and basic communication and co-ordination challenges -with the addition of sovereignty, <lb/>language and cultural barriers. Clear institutional arrangements are needed, such as a steering committee <lb/>with technical working groups to discuss harmonisation of relevant policy and data exchange. In addition, <lb/>many member states did not have one-stop shops at the outset or not with anything like this scope. After a <lb/>decade, fewer than 40% of the requirements are yet in place. <lb/>In the EU, the process of establishing the PSCs has gone alongside and in some cases driven <lb/>permitting and licensing reforms. The stages are similar, although there are different stakeholders and more <lb/>powerful incumbents to manage. The potential benefits are often huge but the scale of the task is also large, <lb/>with numerous competent authorities and enforcement agencies to work with. <lb/>22 ASEAN Services Integration Report 2016 <lb/>0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% <lb/>License for food distribution <lb/>License to provide accomodation <lb/>Licencse for plumbing, heating or… <lb/>License to serve alcohol <lb/>Approval of hygiene/sanitary… <lb/>Approval safety compliance <lb/>Registration on a sector-specific register <lb/>Social security registration <lb/>Application for VAT number <lb/>Application for Tax ID/number <lb/>Business registration <lb/>Points of Single Contact (EU28+) <lb/>Detailed requirements and contact details included in PSC <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Challenges and policy recommendations for ASEAN <lb/>One quarter of trade in ASEAN in 2015 was between member states 23 . Intra-ASEAN M&amp;A activities <lb/>continued to rise in 2016, suggesting an increase in intraregional corporate activities and regional <lb/>expansion of investment by ASEAN companies. In most ASEAN Member States, intra-ASEAN <lb/>investment is a major source of FDI. <lb/>It should be noted that regulatory barriers can be used as a way to protect weaker economies. For <lb/>instance, when creating the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), the ASEAN-6 committed to eliminate most <lb/>tariff lines by 1 January 2010. Newer members, namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Viet Nam, were <lb/>given longer to implement their commitments, generally 1 January 2015 with some more sensitive items <lb/>planned for 1 January 2018. This was to give less developed states time to strengthen their domestic <lb/>economies before full exposure to competition. However, there is some evidence than foreign FDI crowds <lb/>out domestic firm creation and the prevailing view is that countries lose more than they gain. <lb/>Registration of companies is a target area in the ASEAN e-Government Strategic Plan 2020. To <lb/>achieve this, ASEAN is considering the benefits of harmonization of information requirements for the <lb/>establishment of companies and the creation of an official company register accessible by all Member <lb/>States. <lb/>ASEAN already has experience of managing the institutional arrangements needed to facilitate <lb/>regulatory co-operation and single points of regional information access, through mechanisms to increase <lb/>the efficiency and competitiveness of inter-regional trade. It is clear that the different member states&apos; <lb/>current capacity to negotiate and implement such arrangements varies widely and prioritisation and <lb/>sequencing is important. <lb/>POLICY RECOMMENDATION 5: Define objectives and targets for business registration in ASEAN <lb/>5.1 Supporting development of national systems of business registration. A first step for a positive <lb/>regional business environment should be to support the improvement of national systems. ASEAN <lb/>members could set targets, recognising the current context in each ASEAN member state. Targets could <lb/>include the minimum time taken to register a business (as in the Ease of Doing Business report), cost and <lb/>the number of return visits needed to the One Stop Shop. ASEAN could consider extending this exercise to <lb/>cover aspects of local registration and licensing. This could be achieved, for instance, by assessing the full <lb/>start-up process for key example types of business, such as a restaurant or small manufacturing facility. <lb/>5.2 Encouraging intra-ASEAN investment. If encouraging ASEAN citizens and enterprises to <lb/>invest in other member states by setting up businesses is a significant objective, then there should be one-<lb/>stop shop targets about cross-border accessibility and language and associated legal decisions about <lb/>acceptability of certified translations, foreign bank accounts etc. This requires regulatory co-operation. <lb/>This would progress alongside work on cross-border tariffs and taxation. <lb/>5.3 Regional data sharing. This needs clarity of objectives, such as supporting economic <lb/>development, reducing fraud and money laundering or reducing risks for business. It would require a <lb/>degree of regulatory co-ordination, about thresholds of registration, information gathered and legislation to <lb/>make it accessible. Institutional arrangements such as technical working groups would be needed to review <lb/>requirements and propose actions. <lb/>5.4 Agree on standard entries for business registers. Given the varying pace of development across <lb/>the ASEAN countries, one way to build convergence towards a harmonised or unified business register is <lb/></div>

			<note place="footnote">23 http://asean.org/?static_post=external-trade-statistics-3 <lb/></note>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body>to consider and agree on standard entries for business registers e.g. the information that would need to be <lb/>included in forms. This would further encourage regional data sharing that is consistent and can be <lb/>comparable across ASEAN countries. <lb/>5.5 Build a common platform for company or enterprise names. In parallel to improving national <lb/>databases to ease name-checking process for companies and enterprises, further progress toward data <lb/>sharing can be achieved through the creation of a common platform for company or enterprise names. <lb/>5.6 Integrated network for business start-ups. This could be a longer-term objective but the <lb/>European experience is that achieving national one-stop shops including all national and local registration, <lb/>permit and licensing requirements is extremely difficult to achieve. Making these accessible to cross-<lb/>border users has received even less attention even across the EU. Even the relatively self-contained, <lb/>technologically enabled and business-like world of business registration finds this difficult and in the <lb/>ASEAN context, some member states do not yet have the capacity or infrastructure to put a national <lb/>system in place. <lb/>POLICY RECOMMENDATION 6: Share skills across ASEAN <lb/>6.1 Sharing IT system development skills for government. While national requirements and <lb/>challenges are different, technical skills in implementing IT projects are transferable and member states <lb/>could support each other in implementing and integrating systems. Regional technical and inter-operability <lb/>standards could be developed for new systems, setting the groundwork for further integration in due <lb/>course. </body>
