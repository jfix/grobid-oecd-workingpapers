			<body>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Structural change and the current account: the case of Germany <lb/>Using empirical evidence from panel analysis of current account dynamics and of bilateral trade balances, the <lb/>paper argues that the large German current account surplus during the 2000s can be explained by an increasing gap <lb/>between productivity growth in manufacturing vis-à-vis services. Such a gap is due not only to improvements in the <lb/>manufacturing sector but also to a significant slowdown of productivity growth in services. Therefore, despite the <lb/>success in export markets, the German surplus may signal long-run weaknesses associated with constraints on service <lb/>sector productivity growth and the inability of productivity growth in manufacturing to create positive spill-over <lb/>effects on services. Persistence of barriers to liberalisation in services as well as the dominant type of technological <lb/>progress in manufacturing, based on improving the efficiency of existing products, may partly explain these <lb/>phenomena. A key factor behind these sectoral differences is the education system, which relies on highly specialised <lb/>vocational schools, generating high returns for on the job training and creating incentives for efficiency gains in <lb/>existing products and sectors. The paper concludes that there is room for comprehensive structural policies consistent <lb/>with an equilibrium reduction in the current account surplus, accompanied by higher and more balanced growth. <lb/>JEL Classification: E21; E22; F32; F41; G18; H23; H55; K20; K31; O40 <lb/>Keywords: Germany; productivity growth differences; manufacturing; services; current account <lb/>* * * * * <lb/>Réformes structurelles et balance courante : le cas de l&apos;Allemagne <lb/>À partir des données factuelles issues de l&apos;analyse des graphiques de l&apos;évolution de la balance courante et de la <lb/>balance des échanges bilatéraux, cette étude montre que l&apos;excédent de la balance courante allemande provient de <lb/>l&apos;écart grandissant entre la croissance de la productivité dans le secteur manufacturier et dans celui des services. Ce <lb/>décalage s&apos;explique, d&apos;une part, par les améliorations apportées à l&apos;industrie manufacturière, et, d&apos;autre part, par le <lb/>ralentissement marqué de la hausse de la productivité dans les services. En ce sens, malgré les performances de <lb/>l&apos;Allemagne en matière d&apos;exportation, l&apos;excédent de sa balance courante peut présager de certaines faiblesses sur le <lb/>long terme ; le secteur des services pâtit d&apos;une productivité bridée et ne bénéficie pas non plus de la hausse de la <lb/>productivité du secteur manufacturier. L&apos;explication de ce phénomène réside en partie dans la persistance de barrières <lb/>à la libéralisation des services. En outre, le modèle de progrès technologique dominant dans l&apos;industrie <lb/>manufacturière allemande, axé sur l&apos;amélioration de l&apos;efficacité des produits existants, ne génère pas d&apos;effet <lb/>multiplicateur sur le secteur des services, contrairement à ce qui a été observé aux États-Unis. L&apos;origine de ces <lb/>disparités sectorielles est notamment à rechercher du côté d&apos;un système éducatif qui repose sur des écoles <lb/>professionnelles très spécialisées, très efficaces pour ce qui concerne la formation pratique, incitant à développer des <lb/>gains d&apos;efficacité pour les produits et les secteurs existants. La segmentation de l&apos;éducation fait écho à la sectorisation <lb/>de la réglementation ; elle freine l&apos;adoption des innovations radicales et des nouveaux produits, qui relève d&apos;une <lb/>éducation plus généraliste, et crée de faibles barrières à l&apos;entrée sur un marché intérieur caractérisé par son ampleur. <lb/>L&apos;étude conclut qu&apos;il est possible de mettre en place des politiques structurelles globales compatibles avec une <lb/>réduction de l&apos;excédent de la balance courante, s&apos;accompagnant d&apos;une croissance plus forte et plus équilibrée. <lb/>Classification JEL: E21; E22; F32; F41; G18; H23; H55; K20; K31; O40 <lb/>Mots clés: Allemagne ; écarts de croissance de la productivité ; secteur manufacturier ; secteur des services ; balance <lb/>courante <lb/>© OECD (2012) <lb/>You can copy, download or print OECD content for your own use, and you can include excerpts from OECD <lb/>publications, databases and multimedia products in your own documents, presentations, blogs, websites and teaching <lb/>materials, provided that suitable acknowledgment of OECD as source and copyright owner is given.

			<body>Structural change and the current account: the case of Germany 1 <lb/>By Fabrizio Coricelli 2 and Andreas Wörgötter 3 <lb/>1. Introduction <lb/>Global imbalances in the form of large current account deficits/surpluses are at the center of the <lb/>international policy debate 4 <lb/>According to recent studies (see for instance Cheung et al., 2010), the German surplus in the period <lb/>2004-08 cannot be explained on the basis of a traditional model referring to typical determinants of the <lb/>current account (e.g. demographics, growth rates, macroeconomic policies). <lb/>. Although the China-US mirror imbalances are those that have attracted more <lb/>attention, developments in the euro area have raised the issue of sustainability of the monetary union in a <lb/>context of large imbalances. Large deficits in the so-called periphery of the euro area are mirrored by the <lb/>large surplus of Germany. Although the accumulation of surpluses with respect to peripheral euro area <lb/>countries has been a relevant aspect of the increased German surplus during the 2000s, non-euro area <lb/>countries account for a large proportion of the German surplus too. For instance, in the sample of OECD <lb/>countries, the trade surplus with respect to Greece, Portugal and Spain accounts for about 10% of the sum <lb/>of all surplus positions of Germany with OECD countries, whereas the UK and the US each account for <lb/>more than 12%. However, before jumping to the conclusion that the surplus requires policy interventions <lb/>one should establish that the surplus is the result of distortions and not an equilibrium phenomenon. <lb/>Two different interpretations of the same phenomenon have been advanced: one claiming that the <lb/>surplus reflects the competitiveness of the German industry in world markets 5 ; the other, asserting that the <lb/>increase in net exports reflects the compression of domestic demand due to high domestic savings <lb/>associated with precautionary reasons 6 <lb/>1. <lb/>The content of this paper does not necessarily reflect positions of the OECD Secretariat or the OECD and <lb/>its member countries. The authors gratefully acknowledge in-depth discussions with Isabell Koske, <lb/>Felix Hüfner and Caroline Klein. Any remaining errors are the sole responsibility of the authors. Efficient <lb/>research and statistical assistance was provided by Margaret Morgan. Secretarial assistance by <lb/>Josiane Gutierrez and Pascal Halim is gratefully acknowledged. <lb/>. In fact, both interpretations share the view that reforms in the <lb/>labour market ensured wage moderation, labour market flexibility (part-time and temporary jobs) and a <lb/>2. <lb/>Paris School of Economics-Université Paris 1 and CEPR. <lb/>3. <lb/>OECD, Economics Department and University of Technology, Vienna <lb/>4. <lb/>Naude (2011) argues that &quot; The main lesson is perhaps a rather simple one -the world cannot have <lb/>globalization, financial deregulation and a &apos;non-system&apos; in its global financial architecture (GFA) at the <lb/>same time; Bracht (2011) documents the efforts of G20 leaders to address global imbalances and OECD <lb/>(2011) explores the options how to get most out of international capital flows. <lb/>5. <lb/>For Sinn (2006) the German export boom is a pathology because of high wages in Germany. <lb/>6. <lb/>Hüfner and Koske (2010) have found that determinants of household savings rates in Germany and other <lb/>G7 differ significantly. In addition, and in remarkable difference to other countries, the German saving rate <lb/>fluctuates much less over time -and thus its increase since 2000 can hardly explain the rise in the current <lb/>account surplus. <lb/></body>

			<body>consequent increase in profits and competitiveness of German firms. Moreover, the same labour market <lb/>reforms might have increased job insecurity and uncertainty among workers, with a consequent increase in <lb/>precautionary savings and thus compressing consumption (Bertola and Lo Prete, 2011). <lb/>Although both views find prima facie empirical support, with the competitiveness view supported by <lb/>the rapid increase in productivity in the German manufacturing industry and the precautionary savings <lb/>view supported by the sizable increase in national savings, a closer look at the data suggests a more <lb/>nuanced interpretation. On the productivity front, it is remarkable that the increase in productivity in <lb/>manufacturing has been accompanied by stagnant productivity in the service sector, which is in striking <lb/>contrast with the US. <lb/>More generally, the positive results on exports are related to the so-called &quot;intensive margin&quot;, with an <lb/>increase in exports in existing products rather than in new products. Among EU countries, Germany has <lb/>the largest share of export growth due to the intensive margin, and the lowest from new products, as shown <lb/>in Cheptea et al. (2010). <lb/>Moreover, productivity growth has been achieved with a contribution of technologically intensive <lb/>investments that is still well below the levels of countries like the US. Furthermore, the bulk of Germany&apos;s <lb/>export share gains was achieved in technologically low market segments (Cheptea et al., 2010). In <lb/>summary, despite the positive signs of increased competitiveness there are some signals of potential longer <lb/>term weaknesses. <lb/>Regarding the precautionary savings view, the evidence is weak as the increase in savings took place <lb/>not in the household sector but in the corporate sector 7 <lb/>In this paper, we follow a different approach from those outlined above and we will focus on the <lb/>relative role of &quot;supply side&quot; factors and factors associated with the potential role of labour market <lb/>reforms. We argue that the puzzling surplus in the current account of Germany in the 2000s can be <lb/>explained by an increasing gap between productivity growth in manufacturing vis-à-vis the service sector. <lb/>. The channel of transmission from reforms, <lb/>especially in the labour market, and the current account is therefore different from the one envisioned in <lb/>the precautionary savings approach. Corporate savings have been boosted by labour market reforms, <lb/>leading to a sizable redistribution of income from wages to profits and thus a consequent reduction of <lb/>propensity to consume, which is usually much higher for wage income than for profits. <lb/>In Germany the relative productivity of manufacturing took off together with the preparations for <lb/>eastern enlargement of the European Union around the mid-nineties. The progressive elimination of <lb/>barriers for trade and investment, but not labour, generated incentives to outsource only parts of <lb/>manufacturing activity. It was mainly activities with a bias in favour of low and high skill requirements <lb/>which were relocated, while activities requiring medium skills remained in the country, generating scope <lb/>for long term employment relationships, on the job training and incremental productivity increasing <lb/>innovation. With a high specialisation in vocational training the labour force with medium skills may have <lb/>benefited more from eastern enlargement and found attractive work opportunities in the manufacturing <lb/>sector. <lb/>Such a gap is due not only to improvements in the manufacturing sector but also to a significant <lb/>slowdown of productivity growth in services. This could have something to do with the observation that <lb/>technologies in the services sectors of Germany are biased in favour of low skilled workers with unstable <lb/>employment relationships and little scope for on the job training, while the emergence of new firms and <lb/>7. <lb/>See Hüfner and Koske (2010). <lb/></body>

			<body>radical innovation is hampered by restrictive product market regulation and the prevalence of a banking <lb/>system that favours financing of existing firms relative to start-ups with no track record. Of course, the <lb/>solution to the problem would not be to reduce productivity growth in manufacturing but to significantly <lb/>boost productivity in services. 8 <lb/>Looking at structural factors rather than short term macro variables reveals that there is room for <lb/>structural policies consistent with an equilibrium reduction in the current account surplus accompanied by <lb/>higher growth going hand in hand with the services sector becoming more attractive for investments and <lb/>employment than currently perceived. We argue in the paper that the CA surplus is both the symptom of <lb/>increased productivity in the manufacturing sector and stagnant productivity in the service sector. We do <lb/>not have to resort to a &quot; wage compression &quot; argument, because all elements of our reasoning refer to market <lb/>responses and incentives. <lb/>In this respect, the closest paper to ours is the work by Cova et al. (2009) that uses a multi-region <lb/>DSGE model and simulate the effects of the actual total factor productivity (TFP) dynamics in both <lb/>tradable and non-tradable sectors on the current account of the US, euro area and Japan. Their results <lb/>attribute the large current account deficit of the US to the surge in TFP in the service sector in the US, <lb/>relative to the other areas. This pickup of service sector productivity is possibly a consequence of the faster <lb/>diffusion of information and communication technologies in the US. Reasons for this difference could stem <lb/>from regulatory differences, which provide more protection for incumbents in Europe and Japan. <lb/>Moreover, a deeper analysis of the sectoral dynamics of productivity and its relation to potential <lb/>distortions is warranted. Such analysis should also focus on the peculiar education system prevailing in <lb/>Germany, a system that is sticking out with its bias in favour of specialised vocational schools and skill <lb/>creation in the manufacturing sectors. Such educational system can explain to a great extent the success of <lb/>the German economy, a success that may not be sustainable in a world of rapid technological change and <lb/>rapid innovation both in manufacturing and service sectors. <lb/>To emphasize our contribution and maximize the comparability with the existing literature, we extend <lb/>empirical models recently estimated for OECD countries to include the productivity of manufacturing and <lb/>service sectors and the role of labour market reforms. Our empirical analysis is based on three different <lb/>samples and methods. The first is based on a panel of OECD countries for the period 1960-2007. The <lb/>second is based on the analysis of the bilateral trade balance of Germany with OECD countries. For <lb/>comparability with the first approach we use the same set of variables, which are in this case the relative <lb/>values of Germany with the partner countries. Such bilateral approach adds a new dimension and <lb/>robustness to the relevance of specific variables, especially those relating to structural factors and to policy <lb/>reforms. Indeed, such approach has been followed in recent work on the impact of reforms on the trade <lb/>balance for euro area countries (Berger and Nitsch, 2010). Finally, we estimate the same model for the <lb/>time series for Germany for the period 1970-2007. This last analysis is more tentative as the number of <lb/>observations is more limited and the information on the relative behaviour with respect to other OECD <lb/>countries is not taken into account. However, we use these estimates as a robustness check of the other <lb/>analyses, as we find that the main results apply also to the time series for Germany. <lb/>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the main stylized facts concerning the <lb/>dynamics of the German current account in the last three decades. A longer time period has been chosen in <lb/>order to allow us also the application of time series methods, although this inevitably risks working with <lb/>8. <lb/>Simulations reported in Arnold and Wörgötter (2011) suggest that aligning product market regulation in <lb/>Germany with the three least regulated economies would boost overall labour productivity by about 10% <lb/>over a period of 10 years. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<body>data breaks around the time of unification. Section 3 discusses the role of structural factors, namely the <lb/>different productivity growth in manufacturing and services, as determinants of the dynamics of the current <lb/>account in simple two-sector inter-temporal models. Section 4 summarizes the descriptive evidence on <lb/>sectoral productivity growth in Germany and more generally on the sectoral output dynamics in Germany. <lb/>Section 5 contains our econometric analysis. Section 6 concludes. <lb/>2. Stylized facts and the macro picture <lb/>Figure 1 shows the remarkable surge in the German current account surplus that took place during the <lb/>2000s. Focusing on long term trends, it is interesting to note that this surge, and the previous one that <lb/>occurred in the 1980s, were both associated with a simultaneous increase in savings and a decline in the <lb/>investment rate. However, in both occasions, swings in savings played the dominant role, with the <lb/>investment rate displaying a secular decline since 1980, that in fact came to halt at the beginning of the <lb/>2000s. 9 <lb/>Figure 1. Germany: Current account balance, savings and investment, % of GDP <lb/>Furthermore, at least based on current observations, the crisis of 2009 brought about only a <lb/>moderate decline in the surplus. <lb/>Source: IMF, WEO Database, 2011. <lb/>Furthermore, recent developments in the current account hide an even stronger gap between private <lb/>savings and investments. Indeed, the reduction in the current account observed in 2009-10 is entirely due <lb/>to the budget deficit increase associated with the output fall induced by the global crisis. By contrast, the <lb/>private savings-investment gap increased in 2009-10. <lb/>It is worth noting that the increase in private savings is fully explained by the increase in enterprise <lb/>savings, as households savings have remained broadly constant during the 2000s (Figure 2). This suggests <lb/>that the current account dynamics cannot be explained by simple inter-temporal behaviour of consumers. <lb/>Moreover, as the household savings rate is rather stable, there seems also little evidence of precautionary <lb/>savings by households in response to higher uncertainty induced by reforms, especially in the labour <lb/>market. <lb/>9. <lb/>See Hüfner and Koske (2010) for a description of German household savings, which is surprisingly stable <lb/>relative to other G7 countries. <lb/>-5 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>1980 <lb/>1981 <lb/>1982 <lb/>1983 <lb/>1984 <lb/>1985 <lb/>1986 <lb/>1987 <lb/>1988 <lb/>1989 <lb/>1990 <lb/>1991 <lb/>1992 <lb/>1993 <lb/>1994 <lb/>1995 <lb/>1996 <lb/>1997 <lb/>1998 <lb/>1999 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2010 <lb/>Investment <lb/>Current account <lb/>Savings <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 2. Germany: National and household savings, % of disposable income <lb/>Source: OECD. <lb/>These observations motivate our analysis, which focuses on structural forces associated with the <lb/>relative dynamics of manufacturing and service sectors. The increased savings of enterprises are linked to a <lb/>significant change in income distribution that has seen the share of labour income declining during the <lb/>2000s, a decline sharper than the trend decline observed since the 1970s. The increased savings by <lb/>enterprises have been partly invested abroad, which is consistent with the increasing current account <lb/>surplus. The unbalanced growth of productivity, concentrated in manufacturing, may be linked with lack of <lb/>domestic investment opportunities for the increased corporate savings. Indeed, higher productivity in <lb/>manufacturing has been sustained by delocalization of manufacturing in emerging Europe, which has left <lb/>higher value added production phases in Germany 10 <lb/>2.1. What happened in the 2000s? Identifying the shocks <lb/>. Furthermore, differently from other European <lb/>countries, Germany has delocalized capital intensive activities, rather than labour intensive processes, with <lb/>a consequent reduction of capital/labour ratios at home. Thus, a high return to investment in services <lb/>sectors combined with regulatory entry barriers brought about slow growth in services. Indeed, <lb/>Christopoulou and Vermeulen (2010) observe high mark-ups for services in the euro area, hinting at low <lb/>competition in comparison with the US. Moreover, mark-ups in services sectors relative to manufacturing <lb/>in Germany are among the highest in the euro area. On the other hand, mark-ups in manufacturing have <lb/>fallen over time between the seventies and early two thousands. <lb/>What types of shocks can be associated with the sharp inversion of tendency in the CA displayed in <lb/>Figure 1? Three elements are traditionally identified. <lb/>i) The post-German unification shock. In the 2000s there is indeed a reversal of the behaviour <lb/>associated to the unification of the previous decade. Following unification the initial increase in real wages <lb/>due to the jump of wages in east Germany and a mainly publicly financed construction boom, damaged <lb/>10. <lb/>Herzer (2011) finds a positive relation long run relationship between FDI and total factor productivity for <lb/>the economy as a whole. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 <lb/>National savings <lb/>Hosehold savings <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<body>competitiveness of the German export sector, which put downward pressure on wages, restoring <lb/>competitiveness of German exports. ii) Pension and labour market reform. Reforms increasing flexibility in <lb/>the labour market, bringing long-term benefit recipients back into the labour market and tightening future <lb/>conditions for pension transfers might have increased uncertainty and thus induced precautionary savings <lb/>on the part of German households. However, it is also conceivable that labour market and pension reforms <lb/>-if turning out to be successful and boosting employment -reduce uncertainty and prevent precautionary <lb/>savings. iii) A third factor, less of a shock, but rather an external opportunity, can be defined as <lb/>globalization plus enlargement of EU to new member states. <lb/>Demand for capital intensive sectors (machinery, automobile) from emerging markets, China <lb/>in primis, in addition to opportunities for investing in new EU members, have boosted both exports and <lb/>foreign investments. The latter phenomenon is associated to the so-called Bazaar economy view (Sinn, <lb/>2006). FDI in capital intensive sectors and in production of intermediate goods for such sectors is <lb/>consistent with both an increase in value added in exporting companies and with a reduction in the capital-<lb/>labour ratio in the domestic economy, with a corresponding downward pressure on real wages. <lb/>Income distribution in favour of profits increased the overall propensity to save. Wage moderation <lb/>improved cost competitiveness especially vis-à-vis euro area partners. Overall, it appears that labour <lb/>market reforms benefitted more manufacturing than services, not the least because demand for the <lb/>domestic sector was constrained by low income growth 11 <lb/>Figure 3 illustrates how in the 2000s the labour share in total value added fell well below the secular <lb/>downward trend. <lb/>. Therefore, despite some progress, there is still <lb/>room for productivity-enhancing reforms in the service sector, without damaging the successful German <lb/>export sector. <lb/>Figure 3. Germany: Labour share in total Value Added <lb/>Source: EUKlems. <lb/>11. <lb/>This does not mean that by reverse argumentation higher wage growth would have been better for the <lb/>German economy. The outcome is driven by market forces under given constraints of the external <lb/>environment (expansionary) and the regulatory environment for the domestic economy (restrictive). <lb/>0.56 <lb/>0.58 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.62 <lb/>0.64 <lb/>0.66 <lb/>0.68 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.72 <lb/>0.74 <lb/>1970 <lb/>1971 <lb/>1972 <lb/>1973 <lb/>1974 <lb/>1975 <lb/>1976 <lb/>1977 <lb/>1978 <lb/>1979 <lb/>1980 <lb/>1981 <lb/>1982 <lb/>1983 <lb/>1984 <lb/>1985 <lb/>1986 <lb/>1987 <lb/>1988 <lb/>1989 <lb/>1990 <lb/>1991 <lb/>1992 <lb/>1993 <lb/>1994 <lb/>1995 <lb/>1996 <lb/>1997 <lb/>1998 <lb/>1999 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/></body>

			<body>Summing up, there were several factors that boosted manufacturing production and productivity, most <lb/>importantly the combination of a expansionary external environment with a restoration of competitiveness, <lb/>supported by labour market reforms. However, such boost was not extended to the service sector, which <lb/>suffered from the unification aftermath consolidation of public finances, as well as suppressed dynamism. <lb/>2.2. The current account and growth in Germany <lb/>Looking at the behaviour of the German current account in connection with the rate of growth of GDP <lb/>(Figure 4), it emerges that there exists a weak but positive correlation, namely the current account <lb/>improves as the growth rate increases. One notable exception is the unification boom in the early nineties, <lb/>which led to a sharp reduction of the current account surplus. <lb/>Figure 4. Germany: Current account balance and GDP growth <lb/>Source: IMF, WEO Database, 2011. <lb/>Generally, the relationship between overall growth rate and the current account is not easy to <lb/>disentangle. The above picture seems consistent with empirical evidence that shows that growth causes <lb/>savings rather than the opposite and, moreover, that in advanced economies savings do not cause <lb/>investments. As a result, the current account may improve during periods of higher growth (the 1980s and <lb/>2000s before the crisis in Germany as shown in Figure 5). These views are consistent with the presence of <lb/>inertia in consumption, linked for instance to habit formation. In addition, economic integration with lower <lb/>per capita income countries implies capital outflows from richer countries. In principle, this may be <lb/>consistent with standard inter-temporal models of the current account with no habit formation in <lb/>consumption. Forward looking consumers anticipate future growth, reducing savings today to smooth <lb/>consumption. When growth materializes there is no increase in consumption and thus a surplus in the <lb/>current account. However, attributing such ability to anticipate future trends to consumers appears not fully <lb/>realistic. <lb/>Summing up, it appears that standard models of current account determinants that include only <lb/>aggregate output growth are not capable of explaining the large increase in the German CA surplus during <lb/>the 2000s: these models imply a large unexplained component (see Cheung et al., 2010). <lb/>Building on our observation that in Germany the domestic sector does not equally benefit from the <lb/>success of the export sector, we extend those models to include the relative behaviour of manufacturing <lb/>and services as a possible channel to explain CA developments. <lb/>-6 <lb/>-4 <lb/>-2 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>1980 <lb/>1982 <lb/>1984 <lb/>1986 <lb/>1988 <lb/>1990 <lb/>1992 <lb/>1994 <lb/>1996 <lb/>1998 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2004 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2010 <lb/>CA/GDP <lb/>GDP growth <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<body>3. Structural determinants of the current account: dynamics of manufacturing and service sectors <lb/>We indeed find evidence that the current account improves when productivity growth is concentrated <lb/>in manufacturing, whereas the current account deteriorates when productivity improvements occur <lb/>predominantly in services. As this result is not obvious in the context of standard inter-temporal models, in <lb/>the next section we briefly discuss under what conditions such outcome arises in standard models. <lb/>Following a large part of the empirical literature, we make the strong assumption that non-tradable sector <lb/>coincides with services, although we are aware that an increasing share of services is tradable. <lb/>Nevertheless, our analysis goes through as long as manufacturing is relatively more tradable than services. <lb/>3.1. Structural change in an inter-temporal model <lb/>In a standard inter-temporal model, the effects of an increase in total factor productivity in services <lb/>produces ambiguous results on the current account. Fournier and Koske (2010) simulate a macroeconomic <lb/>model to study the impact on the current account of various productivity shocks. The effects crucially <lb/>depend on assumptions on the relative value of the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution and the <lb/>intra-temporal elasticity of substitution between tradable and non-tradable goods. Specifically, if the <lb/>intra-temporal elasticity of substitution between tradable and non-tradable goods is smaller than the inter-<lb/>temporal elasticity of substitution, the current account deteriorates as a result of an increase in total factor <lb/>productivity in non-tradable sectors. Indeed, such assumption implies that consumption of tradable goods <lb/>increases as consumption on non-tradable goods increases. An increase in total factor productivity in the <lb/>non-tradable sector, leading to increased output and thus consumption of non-tradable goods, is thus <lb/>accompanied by a parallel increase in consumption of tradable goods. <lb/>Ostry and Reinhart (1992) find for developing and emerging economies a larger intra-temporal <lb/>elasticity of substitution relative to the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution. This result, however, seems <lb/>less relevant for advanced economies. The inter-temporal elasticity of substitution can be associated with <lb/>the development of financial markets, which is higher in more advanced economies. The final effect on the <lb/>current account depends on the dynamics of output in the tradable sector. If one assumes free mobility of <lb/>labour across sectors, the increase in TFP in non tradable sectors may cause a shift of labour from tradable <lb/>to non-tradable sectors, producing a reduction in employment and output in the tradable sector. This effect <lb/>reinforces the consumption effect, leading to a worsening of the current account. <lb/>Figure 5 describes such a process of reallocation induced by an increase in TFP in the non-tradable <lb/>sector. Employment in tradables can be read from right to left, whereas employment in non-tradables from <lb/>left to right. The x-axis measures the total labour force. The downward sloping curves describe the <lb/>marginal product of labour in the two sector, thus the wage rate expressed in units of tradable goods. The <lb/>increase in TFP in non-tradable produces an initial upward shift of the marginal product locus in <lb/>non-tradables from A to B. However, this curve shifts down to the curve C as the real exchange rate <lb/>depreciates as a result of the growth in TFP in non tradables. However, the decline in the real exchange <lb/>rate is less than proportional to the increase in productivity. The final equilibrium is at point E′, which <lb/>implies an increase in employment in the non-tradable sector and a fall in employment in the tradable <lb/>sector. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>Figure 5. Sectoral labour reallocation and productivity shocks <lb/>From this reallocation of labour across sectors the effect on consumption, output and the current <lb/>account follows. Higher employment in non-tradables implies higher consumption of non-tradables. From <lb/>our maintained assumptions on the elasticity of substitution, both inter-temporal and between tradable and <lb/>non-tradable goods, we obtain that domestic consumption of tradables increases as well. At the same time, <lb/>the reallocation of labour away from tradable sectors implies a decline of output in the tradable sector. <lb/>Therefore, in response to an increase in TFP in non-tradables consumption of tradables increases whereas <lb/>output of tradables falls, producing a worsening of the current account. <lb/>An additional characteristic of Germany is that it has a positive net foreign asset position. This implies <lb/>that, irrespective of the assumption on intra-temporal and inter-temporal elasticity of substitution, a <lb/>positive shock to TFP in non tradable sector induces a deterioration of the current account (see Vegh, <lb/>2011). Summing up, structural changes in the economy have a significant influence on the behaviour of the <lb/>current account. Asymmetric changes in productivity across sectors, for a given overall rate of growth of <lb/>the economy, may imply different paths of the current account. For the case of Germany, we argue that the <lb/>analysis of relative productivity of tradable versus non-tradable sectors may offer an explanation of the <lb/>puzzling dynamics of the German current account, characterized by a surge in the current account surplus <lb/>during the 2000s. Under the assumption listed above, such surplus may have its origin in the rapid growth <lb/>in productivity in manufacturing sectors, coupled with stagnant productivity in the service sector. <lb/>Furthermore, the unbalanced productivity growth in favour of manufacturing is accompanied by an <lb/>increase in the share of employment and value added of that sector in the total economy. <lb/>The relative expansion of the manufacturing sector suggests that innovation in manufacturing does not <lb/>create positive externalities on growth in service activities. This is likely to be due to the type of innovation <lb/>occurring in manufacturing, associated with a &quot;learning-by-doing&quot; process with incremental innovation <lb/>that has little positive spill-over effects on growth of services. To support this view, next section provides <lb/>some descriptive evidence on the dynamics of productivity, output and employment in the different sectors <lb/>in Germany. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2. Evidence on sectoral dynamics in Germany <lb/>A first striking observation on the dynamics of sectoral productivity growth in Germany arises from a <lb/>comparison with the US. Figure 6 reports the behaviour of TFP in the manufacturing sector and the share <lb/>of manufacturing in total value added for Germany and the US. The contrast is remarkable. During the <lb/>1990s the pattern in Germany 12 <lb/>Figure 6a. Germany: Share of manufacturing in total VA and TFP <lb/>is similar to the one in the US, with a declining share of manufacturing in <lb/>total value added accompanied by increasing TFP in manufacturing. The 2000s mark a sudden shift in this <lb/>trend, with the share of manufacturing stabilizing, and in fact slightly increasing, during an acceleration of <lb/>the increase in TFP in the manufacturing sectors. <lb/>Figure 6b.

			<body>We now turn to the behaviour of productivity in manufacturing versus the service sectors. Figure 7 <lb/>shows that starting at the end of the 1990s TFP growth has been stagnant in the service sector whereas it <lb/>has accelerated in the manufacturing sector. <lb/>Figure 7. Germany: TFP in manufacturing and service <lb/>Source: EUKlems. <lb/>A similar picture arises when looking at labour productivity (real value added per hour worked), <lb/>although labour productivity in services tends to grow faster than TFP during the 2000s. For both <lb/>indicators, the 2000s mark a sizable decline in the trend growth of productivity in services. <lb/>Figure 8.

			<body>These are the stylized facts that our empirical analysis takes into account in explaining the dynamics <lb/>of the current account, which seems to be unexplained by standard models and recent empirical analysis. <lb/>Accordingly, our empirical analysis, which focuses on the relationship between the relative growth in total <lb/>factor productivity in manufacturing versus service sectors and the current account balance, is presented in <lb/>the following section. <lb/>4. Empirical analysis <lb/>We implement an empirical model of the current account that adds to traditional variables the relative <lb/>productivity growth of manufacturing vs. services. We isolate the effect of the relative productivity for a <lb/>given overall growth rate. First, we analyze the determinants of the current account balance in a panel of <lb/>OECD countries over the period 1970-2007 and then we restrict the analysis to Germany. <lb/>4.1. Determinants of the current account balance: A Panel analysis <lb/>We extend the model by Clovis et al. (2010) to incorporate the productivity in manufacturing and <lb/>services. Our presumption is that TFP in the service sector has a negative impact on the current account, <lb/>whereas TFP in manufacturing exerts a positive impact on the current account. <lb/>In order to emphasize the role of relative productivity in manufacturing and services, we take the <lb/>model estimated by Clovis et al. (2010) and simply add a relative productivity variable. The estimation is <lb/>based on an error correction model. Our sample is smaller than the one estimated by Clovis et al. because <lb/>of data availability for TFP. We use the Klems database for the estimates of TFP, which is obtained from a <lb/>growth accounting framework, adjusting for the quality of both labour and capital (capital is differentiated <lb/>between ICT and non-ICT). <lb/>Our prior is that relative productivity exerts a long-run effect rather than a short-run effect, as it rests <lb/>on reallocation of labour across sectors. We first replicate the Clovis et al. (2010) approach, with some <lb/>differences, namely we: i) do not consider lagged independent variables, given the yearly frequency of the <lb/>data and the error correction specification, and ii) variables are not measured in terms of deviation from <lb/>sample means, as the presence of time effects should take into account external common shocks. <lb/>Demographic factors, terms of trade, the real interest rate, budget balance and overall per capita growth <lb/>rates enter the model. We follow the error-correction approach used by Clovis et al. and refer to their work <lb/>for the statistical tests on the appropriateness of the model. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2 results are <lb/>broadly in line with Clovis et al. (2010). Column 1 refers to a replication of their estimates with the same <lb/>specification, but the above described differences, Column 2 adds the relative productivity variable and <lb/>column 3 provides the estimates achieved by Clovis et al. All coefficients have the same signs and <lb/>comparable magnitudes as in Clovis et al. (2010). In addition, the speed of adjustment is also almost <lb/>identical to the one in Clovis et al. <lb/>The only notable differences are that in our estimation the change in real GDP per capita is significant <lb/>only in the short run, whereas in Clovis et al. it is significant and with a negative sign both in the short run <lb/>and in the long run. Furthermore, in our estimation the real interest rate is significant and with positive sign <lb/>both in the short and in the long run, whereas in Clovis et al. it is significant only in the short run and with <lb/>a negative sign. The positive sign seems more in line with both inter-temporal theories or with the view <lb/>that higher real interest rates are associated with tighter monetary policy and thus with more restraint on <lb/>domestic demand. Nevertheless, it is likely that the real interest rate captures as well some of the effects of <lb/>the real GDP per capita variable. Finally, in our estimation the budget balance has a significant impact both <lb/>in the long run and in the short run, whereas in Clovis et al. it is significant only in the short run. We then <lb/>add relative TFP, as ratio of the level of TFP in manufacturing with respect to services to the estimated <lb/>equation. Note that the relative level of productivity is relevant for the level of the current account, as the <lb/></body>

			<body>effect we try to emphasize is linked to the supply side and then it reflects the shift in production across the <lb/>two sectors. <lb/>When added to the model, relative total factor productivity in manufacturing versus services appears <lb/>highly significant, especially in the long run. Therefore, we find empirical support for the view advanced, <lb/>according to which the current account improves when productivity changes more rapidly in <lb/>manufacturing rather than in the service sector. <lb/>Table 1.

Bilateral trade balances <lb/>The dynamics of the German current account is often linked to a switch to surplus with respect to <lb/>advanced economies and in particular to euro area countries. It may thus be useful to extend the previous <lb/>analysis to bilateral positions of Germany with respect to OECD partners. In such bilateral analysis, the <lb/>position of Germany is determined by the relative value of the determinants of the current account balance <lb/>(trade balance in the bilateral analysis). The bilateral indicators take into account changes in the partner <lb/>countries and thus add an interesting perspective to the dynamics of the trade balance. <lb/></body>

			<body>We essentially replicate the model used in the panel analysis and extend it to the behaviour of bilateral <lb/>trade balances of Germany. As in Berger and Nitsch (2010), we focus on the bilateral trade balance, <lb/>measured as a ratio of total trade. <lb/>The results of the bilateral analysis broadly confirm those for the panel analysis (Tables 3 and 4). <lb/>Relative productivity in manufacturing vs. services within countries remains highly significant. Relative <lb/>productivity growth between countries (change in GDP per capita) is now significant, and negative, both in <lb/>the long and in the short run. Relative real interest rate between countries has also a significant and positive <lb/>effect on the trade balance, both in the short and in the long run, whereas the relative budget balance is not <lb/>significant anymore. <lb/>Table 3.

Their results indicate that structural reforms, both in <lb/>labour and goods markets, induce an improvement in the current account, a result found by Bertola and <lb/>Lo Prete (2011) for labour market reform. <lb/>4.2.1. The role of labour market reform <lb/>We extend the previous model by adding an indicator of labour market restrictions, in line with the <lb/>approach suggested by Bertola and Lo Prete (2011). Different from their approach, we consider <lb/>simultaneously the role of labour market reform and the productivity variables, both at the aggregate level <lb/>and in relation to the relative productivity of manufacturing vs. service sectors. Bertola and Lo Prete <lb/>exclude productivity variables by arguing that those will have an impact on labour market reform. <lb/>Although it is conceivable that labour market reforms are associated with the state of the overall economy, <lb/>in a political economy framework in which reforms are done in specific states of the economy (good times <lb/>or bad times?). However, we believe that the dynamics of productivity is unlikely to have large effects on <lb/>labour market reforms. Furthermore, even if one believes that the overall state of the economy, and thus <lb/>aggregate productivity, may have an impact on labour market reforms, there is no reason for having an <lb/>effect of relative productivity in manufacturing and service sectors on labour market reform. Finally, <lb/>considering simultaneously labour market reform and productivity variables permits to isolate the <lb/>&quot;uncertainty&quot; effect of labour market reform from its potential effect on productivity. <lb/></body>

Interestingly, such a view is also consistent with Berger et al. (2010), who also use <lb/>bilateral trade balances but for a sample of euro area countries, although their interpretation rests on higher <lb/>efficiency, hence competitiveness, of the reforming country, leading to an improvement in the current <lb/>account. Our interpretation is consistent with both an effect on increased savings and with efficiency gains. <lb/>Indeed, we argue that labour market reform has led to a sizable increase in profits and a shift in income <lb/>distribution in favour of profits, with a consequent reduction of propensity to consume. Indeed, as shown <lb/>before, savings have increased largely because of an increase in corporate rather than household savings. <lb/>Interestingly, even considering the role of labour market reform, relative productivity in <lb/>manufacturing vs. services plays a significant role as a long run determinant of the current account.

Time series for Germany <lb/>We next apply the same model to time series data for Germany over the period 1971-2007. The <lb/>assumption of equal coefficients on productivity in manufacturing and services that worked in the panel <lb/>sample does not seem to apply to the time series for Germany. Therefore, we introduce separately <lb/>productivity in the two sectors. Furthermore, as TFP data from Klems are available only since 1991, we <lb/>use labour productivity, which nevertheless is highly correlated with TFP.

Nevertheless, it is remarkable that both for the level and the changes the introduction of <lb/>sectoral productivities sharply reduces the magnitude of the generally unexplained behaviour of the <lb/>German current account during the 1990 and 2000s. Therefore, if one takes into account the peculiar <lb/>relative productivity behaviour of manufacturing and service sectors, the puzzle of the large current <lb/>account surplus of the 2000s can be actually explained. <lb/>In contrast with the result for the panel analysis on OECD countries, the analysis of the German time <lb/>series also highlights that higher growth rates tends to be associated with an improvement of the current <lb/>account, unless the growth is concentrated in the service sector. <lb/>Figure 9.

			<body>Figure 10. Germany: Change in the current account balance, 1971-2007 <lb/>4.4. Interpreting the results <lb/>The empirical analysis has emphasized the role of TFP growth in manufacturing relative to services as <lb/>a channel for reducing imbalances in the current account and, at the same time, broadening the scope of the <lb/>growth of output in the German economy. However, such results could actually reveal some additional and <lb/>deeper issues. <lb/>First, the dynamics of productivity and of job creation in the two sectors are inter-dependent. Indeed, <lb/>we conjecture that the above pattern of productivity dynamics is related to a general lack of dynamism in <lb/>the German economy, as indicated by the low rate of trend growth. Second, in Germany there are no <lb/>evident signs of positive spillover effects of productivity growth in manufacturing on productivity growth <lb/>and employment creation in services. <lb/>An interesting perspective can be gained by looking at the contribution of IT capital to the growth of <lb/>value added. Contrasting Germany to the US, Figure 11 illustrates these contributions for the total <lb/>economy, manufacturing and the service sectors for the 1990s and the 2000s. In both periods Germany is <lb/>outpaced in all sectors. This lag is extremely significant as it may indicate the inability to absorb <lb/>innovation, usually embodied in IT capital. In summary, despite the success in export markets, the <lb/>performance of Germany in the area of innovation and IT investments appears unsatisfactory. In addition, <lb/>export growth in Germany comes predominantly from the so-called &quot;intensive margin&quot;. As shown earlier <lb/>the contribution of the intensive margin, namely the increase in exports linked to existing products, is by <lb/>far the largest of all the OECD countries. Consequently, despite a sharp increase in profits as a share of <lb/>GDP, investment dynamics in Germany has been very moderate. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

Contribution of IT Investment to VA growth, 2000-07 <lb/>Source: EUKlems. <lb/>As mentioned above, this may be due to the bias in the education system in favour of specialised <lb/>vocational training as opposed to general education (on this see Krueger and Krishna, 2004), and possibly <lb/>to a lack of finance for innovative activities. A system of specialised vocational schools creates a bias for <lb/>manufacturing sectors and incremental innovation. Contributing to exceptionally low youth <lb/>unemployment, this system is very popular among German parents who see their youngsters steered <lb/>towards a safe workplace nearby in an otherwise unstable environment 13 <lb/>Structural reforms are needed to foster radical innovation, introduction of new products and thus to <lb/>increase the dynamism of the economy and reach a higher trend growth trajectory. To exploit these forces, <lb/>significant changes are required, in particular concerning the completion of the European Union internal <lb/>market, but also in the education system and in financial markets. An education system biased towards <lb/>vocational schools is perfect for optimally exploiting the comparative advantages of an existing economic <lb/>structure, but not conducive to the type of innovation and dynamism we alluded to before. <lb/>. As it has been recently <lb/>underlined for the case of the US, expanding ICT investments and in general introduction of high tech <lb/>innovations implies large multipliers for job creation in services (Moretti, 2010). <lb/>13. <lb/>Germany, Austria and Switzerland offer a very successful school-to-work transition in form of <lb/> &quot; apprenticeships &quot; . The curriculum of such arrangements is designed in close co-operation with employers <lb/>and social partners, reflecting local labour demand needs. More details can be found in OECD (2010). <lb/>0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>TOTAL INDUSTRIES MANUFACTURING WHOLESALE AND <lb/>RETAIL TRADE <lb/>HOTELS AND <lb/>RESTAURANTS <lb/>TRANSPORT, <lb/>STORAGE AND <lb/>COMMUNICATION <lb/>FINANCE, <lb/>INSURANCE, REAL <lb/>ESTATE AND <lb/>BUSINESS SERVICES <lb/>COMMUNITY SOCIAL <lb/>AND PERSONAL <lb/>SERVICES <lb/>Germany <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>TOTAL INDUSTRIES <lb/>MANUFACTURING <lb/>WHOLESALE AND <lb/>RETAIL TRADE <lb/>HOTELS AND <lb/>RESTAURANTS <lb/>TRANSPORT, STORAGE <lb/>AND COMMUNICATION <lb/>FINANCE, INSURANCE, <lb/>REAL ESTATE AND <lb/>BUSINESS SERVICES <lb/>COMMUNITY SOCIAL <lb/>AND PERSONAL <lb/>SERVICES <lb/>US <lb/>Germany <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)17 <lb/></body>

			<body>Similarly, a financial sector based on traditional banking and on debt secured by collateral is well <lb/>designed for the financing needs of firms with a good track record, but not well suited to support <lb/>dynamism and finance new entry as bank debt heavily relies on relationship banking and thus is biased <lb/>towards existing activities. <lb/>In fact, we argue that the current productivity growth in manufacturing, based on incremental <lb/>innovation and increased efficiency, mainly through a learning-by-doing mechanism, is hardly sustainable <lb/>because it lacks the sources of long run improvements linked to the introduction of new products, entry of <lb/>new firms. In the jargon of trade economists, Germany has expanded its manufacturing production and <lb/>exports through the &quot;intensive&quot; margin, producing more of the existing products, and improving them at <lb/>the margin. Therefore, the forces that may lead to a boost to productivity in the service sector would help <lb/>improve also the spillover from productivity increases in the manufacturing sector to employment creation <lb/>in the services sector. 14 <lb/>5. Concluding remarks and suggestions for future research <lb/>In this paper we focused on a largely unexplored channel for explaining the recent surge of the current <lb/>account surplus in Germany, namely the acceleration in productivity in manufacturing sectors combined <lb/>with stagnant productivity in the service sector. Furthermore, in the US, accelerating productivity in <lb/>manufacturing sectors has been generally accompanied by a decline of the weight of manufacturing in total <lb/>value added. In contrast, in Germany the acceleration in productivity growth in manufacturing sectors went <lb/>hand in hand with a stable share of manufacturing in total value added. We argued that this phenomenon <lb/>reflects two interrelated aspects, not necessarily positive for the sustainability of the rate of growth of the <lb/>German economy. <lb/>First, the type of technological progress in manufacturing is based on improving the efficiency of <lb/>existing technologies and the attractiveness of existing products, consolidating the traditional specialization <lb/>of the German economy. Such efficiency gains do not generate multiplier effects on the service sectors, in <lb/>contrast with what has been observed in the US. Specifically, the role of ICT investments has been limited <lb/>or at least delayed both in manufacturing and service sectors. The second aspect is the lack of dynamism in <lb/>the service sector and the lack of creation of high quality-high wage jobs in services. <lb/>In summary, as these aspects relate to the surge in the current account surplus, such surplus may <lb/>reflect some weaknesses of the German model rather than only its strength in export competitiveness. We <lb/>conjecture that one key factor behind these weaknesses is the segmented education system, which relies on <lb/>vocational schools, with the consequence of creating incentives for efficiency gains in existing products <lb/>and sectors and of creating barriers for absorbing radical innovation and new products, which tend to <lb/>require a more general education. <lb/>These observations indicate that a useful research and policy agenda is to focus on the role of the <lb/>education system for the process of innovation, its typology and the spillover effects across sectors. This <lb/>research can also shed light on the implications of such patterns of innovation and productivity growth for <lb/>job creation and spillover effects in job creation across manufacturing and service sectors. <lb/>In this paper we have provided some evidence that these issues may be relevant for understanding the <lb/>puzzling behaviour of the German current account. Such understanding may also be useful to frame the <lb/>policy debate on the interpretation of the large German current account surplus. <lb/>14. <lb/>Bosma, Stam and Schutjens (2011) find that productivity in services is driven by new entries, which re-<lb/>enforces the importance of removing entry barriers in services sectors. <lb/></body>
