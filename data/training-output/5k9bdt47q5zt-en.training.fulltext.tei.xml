			<figure>La faible croissance en Europe au cours des dernières décennies a augmenté les inquiétudes concernant la<lb/> répartition des revenus et l&apos;exclusion sociale.

			<table>ECO/WKP(2012)29<lb/> INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION<lb/> By Kaja Bonesmo Fredriksen 1<lb/></table>

			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Many European countries have faced sluggish growth over the past decades and the trend has<lb/> worsened in recent years. Contrary to economic booms when most individuals are likely to see substantial<lb/> increases in their income, low growth tends to bring out concerns about stagnating incomes, rising<lb/> inequality and poverty. The recession of the past few years has not only increased attention to rising<lb/> inequalities in OECD countries, but also evoked growing academic and political interest in finding broader<lb/> measures for economic performance than GDP growth. These have included social dimensions, such as<lb/> income dispersion, and various indicators of wellbeing. 2<lb/></p>

			<p>While inequality is often viewed from a national perspective, there are good reasons to analyse it for<lb/> Europe as a whole. Union-wide policies and objectives are already in place in a number of areas. In the<lb/> social sphere, the Europe 2020 strategy defines inclusive growth as one of three main priorities for the<lb/> European Union (EU) and one of the headline targets is 20 million less Europeans in or at risk of poverty<lb/> and social exclusion by 2020. According to Eurostat, the number of such individuals amounted to<lb/> 115 million in 2010. European regional policies, which are absorbing more than a third of EU budget<lb/> (OECD 2007), have also focused on stimulating growth in areas where incomes are relatively low to<lb/> reduce regional disparities. Policies for redistributing individual incomes remain however at the sole<lb/> charge of national governments. Finally, with deeper integration Europeans are likely to look more beyond<lb/> their national borders when they make relative income comparisons.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are, however, important methodological challenges to measuring income dispersion in the<lb/> European Union as a whole. Creating meaningful statistics that summarise cross-country heterogeneity in<lb/> income levels and distributions from scarce and often not fully comparable income data is not easy. For<lb/> this reason much of the existing literature on inequality in the EU still focuses on national levels and trends<lb/> in inequality, which is at times complemented by attempts at clustering countries showing similar<lb/> characteristics. Eurostat publishes measures of income dispersion and poverty in the EU as weighted<lb/> averages of national inequality indicators. Measures of European Union-wide inequality that take into<lb/> account income dispersion between European countries are rare.<lb/> This paper provides a picture of the state and evolution of inequality in the European Union using<lb/> OECD average household disposable income data per decile from the Income <ref type="biblio">Distribution</ref> and Poverty<lb/> Database. It includes 20 EU countries and for most of them covers a time span from the mid-1980s until<lb/> 2008. 3<lb/> 1.<lb/> The author is seconded from the Norwegian Ministry of Finance and works at the Economics Department<lb/> of the OECD. This is one of the technical working papers prepared as background for the Economic<lb/> Survey of the European Union 2012. The author would like to thank Sebastian Barnes especially, and also<lb/> Piritta Sorsa and Peter Hoeller for their useful comments and suggestions, Isabelle Duong and Clara Garcia<lb/> for meticulous statistical work and Olivier Besson for excellent editorial support.<lb/> The paper does not aim to put on the table any new evidence why inequality differs among<lb/> European countries nor what has driven the change in inequality over time. The main contribution of the<lb/> 2.<lb/> The conclusions of the Stiglitz-Fitoussi-Sen Commission initiated in 2008 provide a good example.<lb/> 3.<lb/> Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Romania are not included in the database. Austria,<lb/> Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland, Portugal and Spain are excluded from the time serie<lb/> analysis because of a statistical break in 2004.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2012)29<lb/> paper is twofold: Exploit the rich time dimension in the OECD database to analyse how income growth<lb/> over time has been shared among individuals in European countries as well as to go beyond the traditional<lb/> national approach and consider inequality in the Union as a whole. The methodology used for the latter is<lb/> inspired by among others Brandolini (2007) who looks at EU inequality and Milanovic (2002) who looks<lb/> at global inequality using household survey sources. Given</table>

			<p>the difficulty of the exercise, an additional aim<lb/> of the paper is to ensure transparency in the results obtained by properly accounting for the methodological<lb/> challenges as well as the methodological choices made. Section 2 reviews how growth in total income over<lb/> the past 25 years has been shared among deciles in EU countries. The approach in this section remains<lb/> &quot; national &quot; in the sense that the EU-aggregates are population-weighted national averages. The measure of<lb/> inequality for the European Union as a whole is then presented in Section 3. Section 4 summarises the<lb/> results.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Income growth, but not necessarily (and as much) for all<lb/> EU disposable income growth has been slightly below OECD average with large differences between<lb/> countries<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the past 25 years, household disposable income per capita rose on average by almost 70% in the<lb/> OECD (3.1% annually), with somewhat smaller annual growth over the past 15 years (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In the EU,<lb/> average annual growth was 2.5%. Unsurprisingly, there was quite a difference between the fastest and<lb/> slowest growing European countries, a token of the area&apos;s heterogeneity. This also underlines the<lb/> importance of including the between-country dimension when analyzing inequality over time. Italians have<lb/> seen the lowest growth in their incomes since 1995 while the so-called &quot; catching up economies &quot; such as<lb/> Ireland, Poland and the Slovak Republic have gained the most. Compared to both the United States and the<lb/> whole OECD, Europeans on average and especially in the euro area appear to have lost ground, mainly<lb/> because the performance of the European &quot; core &quot; , Germany and Italy, has been relatively weak.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, how each individual benefits from aggregate disposable income growth depends on how its<lb/> distribution evolves. Income growth can be very concentrated in a few hands, a well-known phenomenon<lb/> from developing and emerging market economies, and there is evidence that this is increasingly the case<lb/> for advanced economies as well (OECD, 2012). Because macro data derived from the national accounts<lb/> only consider national averages, to see how income growth is shared between individuals it is necessary to<lb/> turn to individual-level data, either based on household income surveys or tax data. There are some caveats<lb/> with micro data, most notably a tendency not to capture very well the extremes of the distribution and<lb/> therefore to underestimate inequality. Because of this, and other conceptual differences, there will always<lb/> be discrepancies between micro data and macro data (Annex 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Distribution of income growth has become more unequal driven by changes in the extremes<lb/></head>

			<p>The micro data used in this study is derived from national disposable income surveys and covers the<lb/> entire population. It has been harmonised by national experts via pre-established conventions and<lb/> definitions which enhances cross-country comparability. Another advantage of this particular database is<lb/> that for many countries it goes back to mid-1980s, making it possible to see how inequality has evolved<lb/> over a longer period during which the Union underwent many important changes, notably the addition of<lb/> several new countries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2012)29<lb/></figure>

			<p>Annual average income growth over the past 25 years has been quite low for most deciles in Europe,<lb/> though some still saw their income grow quite substantially (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Part of this difference is due to<lb/> differences in aggregate growth performance of European countries. In Greece, for instance, all deciles<lb/> have seen their income grow more than any German decile has. But there has also been a clear pattern<lb/> between income growth and income ranking, which becomes even clearer when countries that are outliers<lb/> in terms of growth performance 4<lb/></p>

			<p>In general the 10% highest income recipients have seen their incomes grow much more rapidly than<lb/> the rest of the population over the past 25 years (Box 1). This is not only a European phenomenon. Top<lb/> incomes have also been sprinting ahead in the United States. For the OECD as a whole, OECD (2012)<lb/> finds that from 1980 to 2008 the share of income captured by top income recipients rose in most OECD<lb/> countries, though there has been great variation with respect both to the extent of this increase and when it<lb/> started. A second, less striking, observation is that while income growth in European countries on average<lb/> has been similar from d2 to d9, the 10% poorest are losing out. Again, the same has happened (and has<lb/> even been more accentuated) in the United States.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Causes of inequality<lb/></head>

			<p>Cross-country differences in the level of disposable income inequality can be traced back to differences in labour<lb/> market outcomes, household composition, concentration of capital income and differences in the progressivity of tax<lb/> and transfer systems<lb/> 1 . The OECD (2012) &quot; Less income inequality and more growth-Are they compatible? &quot; project<lb/> categorizes countries<lb/> 2 into 5 groups according to inequality origins and finds great variation among EU countries. This<lb/> box summarizes the findings in this project, OECD (2011) &quot; Divided We Stand: Why Inequality keeps rising &quot; as well as<lb/> a few other recent studies on inequality and top incomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Scandinavian countries and Switzerland have low dispersion in labour earnings while cash transfers tend to<lb/> be universal and taxes are not very progressive. In Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Slovak<lb/> Republic and Slovenia wage dispersion tends to be low but so does employment rates whereas part time rates are<lb/> high. Taxes and transfers are not highly progressive. Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland and<lb/> Spain are characterized by rather concentrated labour earnings but much redistribution happens at the family level.<lb/> The United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands have high part time employment rates driving inequality in labour<lb/> market outcomes. Taxes and transfers have a sizeable redistributive impact. Portugal is the only European country in<lb/> the last group with high concentration in both labour, capital and self-employment income as well as a high poverty<lb/> rate. Transfers have little redistributive impact.<lb/> Looking at the evolution of inequality over time reveals a more common pattern among European countries. The<lb/> top decile appears to be capturing an increasing share of total income. The same holds true in largely all OECD<lb/> countries that have seen a rise in income dispersion over the past two decades. Indeed, the rise in top incomes in<lb/> continental Europe appears rather modest compared to what has been the case in some Anglo-Saxon countries and<lb/> notably the United States, especially if one looks at the top 1% of the distribution.<lb/> 3 There is no consensus around the<lb/> causes for this development. Prominent explanations found in the literature include both changes in taxation, labour<lb/> market institutions as well as globalization and technological change.<lb/> Many OECD countries have seen a decline in the progressivity of the tax schedule at the upper tail of the income<lb/> distribution<lb/> 4 over the past decade due to both a decline in top marginal tax rates and an increased income threshold<lb/> from which rates apply. In Europe the picture has been mixed with tax progressivity among top earners decreasing<lb/> quite substantially in Denmark and Ireland, and to a smaller extent, in France, while it has increased in the Czech<lb/> Republic, Hungary, Greece and the Netherlands. Only marginal changes have occurred in the other countries. In<lb/> addition to the changes in the personal income tax schedule, wealth taxes have been recently been abolished in<lb/> Austria (1997), Denmark (1997), Germany (1997),</p>

			<figure>Finland (2006), Luxemburg (2006), Sweden (2007) and Spain<lb/> (2008).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Restricting the analysis to the top 1% of the distribution, <ref type="biblio">Piketty et al. (2011)</ref> find a strong negative relationship<lb/> between top income shares and top income tax rates over the period 1975 to 2008. No country has seen a rise in the<lb/> share of top incomes without significant cuts in top rate tax rates. The correlation appears to be stronger in Anglo-<lb/>Saxon countries than in some European countries. Top rate tax cuts are found to increase the income of the richest<lb/> mainly because they induce top earners to bargaining more for higher salaries and not because they work more or<lb/> resort to less tax avoidance.<lb/> Globalization and technological change may also have led to an increase in the return to skills and thus incomes<lb/> in the top decile relative to the rest of the population. At the utmost extreme of the distribution, higher returns for certain<lb/> types of talent, notably in the sport and entertainment industry as well as financial traders, are likely to have<lb/> contributed to increased relative income of the top 1% (<ref type="biblio">Rosen, 1981; Gordon and Dew-Becker, 2008</ref>). The reward for<lb/> managerial skills is also likely to have been positively affected from globalization among other things as a result of<lb/> improved alternative carrier options available and internationalized competition for managers which have strengthened<lb/> their bargaining power. Growing use of performance related pay, and particularly for CEOs and finance professionals,<lb/> adds weight to these explanations especially in the case of United States.<lb/> At the other end of the distribution, the bottom decile in Europe has on average seen lower income growth than<lb/> the rest of the population. Certain facets of globalization may shed some light over this development. More<lb/> international trade may have lowered employment or reduced the relative earnings of low-income workers if high-<lb/>income workers work disproportionately in (high-productivity) exporting firms. Changes in the labour market may also<lb/> have played a role. The strength of labour market institutions and policies has on average declined over the past 20 to<lb/> 25 years in many OECD countries. This may have had an adverse effect on low earners in the countries concerned.<lb/> However, many such policies (e.g. employment protection legislation, minimum wage) have opposite effects on<lb/> employment and wage dispersion leaving the final impact on inequality undetermined.<lb/> __________________________________________________<lb/></p>

			<head>1. A tax</head>

			<p>is considered to be progressive when the tax paid by of high income groups constitutes a higher share of their income than for lower earners. Similarly, a<lb/> transfer is considered to be progressive when it constitutes a larger share of a low income than a higher income (relative progressivity).<lb/></p>

			<figure>2. The benchmark is the OECD average.<lb/> 3. Observations based on tax data. Includes all income subjected to the personal income tax.<lb/> 4. Earnings are between the gross average wage and 167% of the gross average wage.<lb/> Going beyond this general picture, there are some interesting outliers (Tables 2 and 3):<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Disposable income growth has been very low almost throughout the distribution in both Germany<lb/> and the Netherlands, in particular in the lower deciles. This is especially evident from the mid-<lb/>1990s to 2008 when 30% of the poorest Germans actually had negative real income growth.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Koske et al. (2012)</ref> note Germany is the only country that has seen an increase in labour earnings<lb/> inequality from the mid 1990s to the end 2000s driven by increasing inequality in the bottom half<lb/> of the distribution. Recent years wage moderation can to some extent be explained by weakening<lb/> power of unions since the mid-1990s, as well as a set of reforms in 2003 meant to increase the<lb/> flexibility of the labour market (<ref type="biblio">Burda and Hunt, 2011</ref>). Evidence suggests that unions reduce<lb/> income disparities, though there may be some cross-country variation in the link between the two<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Koske et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> The tax and transfer system mitigated some of these effects in Germany at least over the<lb/> latter period since the inequality reducing effect of both taxes and particularly public transfers<lb/> increased from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2008</ref>). This has not happened in the<lb/> Netherlands. An extensive overhaul of the Dutch social security system starting in the early<lb/> 1980s is probably the main cause why Förster and Pearson (2002) find a larger loss of disposable<lb/> income in the lowest decile in the Netherlands compared to the loss in market income from the<lb/> mid-1980s to mid-1990s. <ref type="biblio">From 1995 to 2005</ref>, taxes in the Netherlands became more progressive,<lb/> whereas the inequality reducing effect of social transfers continued declining.<lb/> • In the United Kingdom the poorest 10% of the population have fared particularly badly compared<lb/> with the rest of the population. Both higher unemployment, which began climbing from the early<lb/> 1980s, and big increases in the number of inactive persons during recessions in the 1980s and<lb/> 1990s are likely to have contributed, however cannot fully explain what has happened since other<lb/> OECD countries have seen similar changes in labour market outcomes. Also, the increasing trend<lb/> in unemployment was reversed from the mid-1990s. What makes the United Kingdom stand out<lb/> is an important increase in the dispersion of earnings (<ref type="biblio">Förster and Pearson, 2002</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Policy changes are also likely to have contributed to low income growth in the bottom of the<lb/> distribution. Brandolini and Smeeding (2009) document a very significant drop in the equalizing<lb/> ECO/WKP(2012)29<lb/> effect of taxes and transfers in the United Kingdom from the early 1980s, although this trend<lb/> appears to be reversed since the turn of the century. Focusing only on the period between the mid<lb/> 1990s and mid 2000s, OECD (2008) finds no change in the redistributive impact of taxes and<lb/> transfers.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Contrary to what happened in most countries, the lowest deciles in Greece and Hungary gained<lb/> over the period compared to the rest of the population. This is also the case for the poorest<lb/> Italians from the mid-1990s.

			<p>Given these country-specificities it is not surprising to find that aggregate inequality measured by the<lb/> Gini index has evolved somewhat differently across European countries (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The Gini index is an<lb/> aggregate measure of inequality that provides a simple and robust picture of inequality across the whole<lb/> distribution. By construction, it is between 0 and 1, and it takes the value of 0 when everyone has the same<lb/> income, and the value 1 when aggregate income is in the hands of only one individual. From the mid-<lb/>1990s to 2008 the Gini decreased (meaning more equality) in Greece, Hungary and Italy, while it increased<lb/> in the other countries for which data for the two periods is available. The increase was particularly strong<lb/> in Sweden and the Netherlands. Over the last 4 years, a period during which comparable data is available<lb/> for more countries, the biggest change in the Gini happened in the East-European countries where<lb/> inequality decreased and in Sweden where it increased.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, it is important to keep in mind that even if all deciles were to grow at exactly the same<lb/> positive rate (which implies that most measures of inequality would remain unchanged), the higher one<lb/> goes up in the distribution, the higher the absolute gain in income would be. Consider the example of<lb/> Denmark: Over the period from the mid-1990s to 2008, the Danes in the lowest decile saw their income<lb/> rise by 1% whereas those in the highest decile increased their income by 29%. Given what they earned in<lb/> 1995, by 2008 the poorest 10% earned 1100 DKK more in absolute terms and the richest 109 000 DKK<lb/> more. Imagine now that the poorest would have captured an equal share of total income growth, and thus<lb/> also increased their income their 1995 incomes by 29%. Their absolute income would then be 25 000<lb/> DKK, which is still a lot less than the richest 10% gained in absolute terms. The reverse is of course also<lb/> true, a given negative income growth rate implies higher absolute income losses in the upper part of the<lb/> distribution.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Creating a single European Union income distribution<lb/></head>

			<p>Until now EU aggregates have been obtained by taking into account differences in the size of the<lb/> population between countries. This way of measuring inequality in European countries is in line with<lb/> Eurostat&apos;s official statistics and retains a national perspective on inequality: What matters for the<lb/> individual is the relative income position in their own country. However, for the reasons outlined it the<lb/> introduction to this paper, it is also valuable to measure inequality in Europe as whole. To do this one must<lb/> take into account between-country inequality which is likely to be large given the heterogeneity of the<lb/> ECO/WKP(2012)29<lb/> countries in the Union. In this approach to EU inequality, the poorest 10% of Europeans are not the sum of<lb/> the 10% poorest in all countries but are likely to be disproportionately from the lower income Eastern<lb/> European countries, and conversely the richest 10% are likely to come from the original EU and the Nordic<lb/> countries.<lb/> The aim of this section is to construct such an aggregate measure of inequality for the whole EU that<lb/> encompasses both within-and between country inequalities. A single European income distribution for the<lb/> whole population was created by stacking the average income of each decile for every country. Income<lb/> dispersion was then measured both by the Gini index as well as the q5/q1 and p90/p10 ratios weighting for<lb/> differences in total population since the number of persons receiving average income of decile x in country<lb/> y depends on the total population of country y. 5<lb/></p>

			<head>The data are adjusted for household composition and price level differences<lb/></head>

			<p>The final sample is as such divided into non-identically<lb/> sized (income, population) groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>Measuring inequality is not simple, and there are added problems in a cross-country context. Micro<lb/> data sources are generally based on household surveys, and must therefore be adjusted to take into account<lb/> differences in household composition. These differences are generally dealt with using an equivalence<lb/> scale that adjusts for the number of people in the household and whether they are adults or children. There<lb/> are many such equivalence scales to choose from. <ref type="biblio">Szulc (2006)</ref> argues that the original OECD equivalence<lb/> scale 6 may be more appropriate to use for Poland and other &quot; less developed &quot; countries than the modified<lb/> OECD equivalence scale 7 as households in such countries tend to spend a higher share of their income on<lb/> food where economies of scale are generally low and a lower share on housing were economies of scale<lb/> are generally larger. The data for this paper is adjusted using the square root scale 8<lb/></p>

			<p>The income needed to purchase a given amount of goods by households is likely to vary by region<lb/> since price levels differ. National income data typically do not adjust for differences in price levels within<lb/> a county, nor does the OECD database. When measuring inequality across countries where the standard of<lb/> living generally varies much more, taking this into account becomes even more important. This can be<lb/> done using either PPP or nominal exchange rates. PPP measures the price for a same basket of goods in<lb/> different countries and as such overcomes the problem of market exchange rates that are not only<lb/> influenced by relative price levels, but also by other factors.<lb/> .<lb/></p>

			<p>The PPP method has however problems of its own, notably that the content of a typical consumption<lb/> basket varies across countries and along the income distribution. Conform to what is common in the<lb/> literature, PPP conversion is still the option preferred in this paper. For comparison purposes, results are<lb/> also presented using nominal exchange rates. The latter shows a much higher level of inequality, which is<lb/> consistent both with theory and the literature.<lb/></p>

			<figure>5.<lb/> The ineqdec0 command in Stata was used to measure inequality. The function aw was used to weight for<lb/> differences in population size.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Assigns a value of 1 to the first household member, of 0.7 to each additional adult member and of 0.5 to<lb/> each child.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Assigns a value of 1 to the household head, of 0.5 to each additional adult member and of 0.3 to each child.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Divides household income by the square root of household size.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Inequality can be measured in a number of at times complementary ways<lb/></head>

			<p>Many inequality measures exist and the choice of indicator is not neutral in the sense that they focus<lb/> on different distributional aspects, and also differ somewhat in their sensitivity to changes in the tails<lb/> versus the middle of the distribution. <ref type="biblio">Evans et al. (2004)</ref> show that while the Gini, Theil and Robin Hood<lb/> indexes as well as the q5/q1 quintile ratio are highly correlated, the coefficient of variation and the p90/p10<lb/> percentile ratio are less well correlated with the others. In this paper, results are mainly reported using the<lb/> Gini index which is the most frequently used measure of inequality.<lb/> However, a drawback of the Gini index is that it does not allow one to focus on particular segments of<lb/> the income distribution. Using income ratios between various quintiles, percentiles and deciles allows a<lb/> more detailed picture of how one distribution differs from another which is why results for EU inequality<lb/> measured by the p90/p10 and q5/q1 ratios are also presented. The two complement each other in the sense<lb/> that while the former is necessary to analyse the very top of the distribution, it is also likely less robust than<lb/> the q5/q1 ratio as the income data for the lowest decile probably includes households with temporary or<lb/> artificially low income such as students or tax avoiders (though the extent of the problem is difficult to<lb/> know).<lb/></p>

			<figure>A problem specific to the OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database is that income is reported<lb/> as average income per decile. Inequality within each decile is therefore lost in the final results. There is no<lb/> way to truly by-pass this problem 9<lb/> 9 .<lb/> The authors of the World Bank Development Report 2006 argue that estimating Lorenz curves instead of<lb/> assigning everyone inside a group the average income is a better approach. In order to do this, one has to<lb/> make an assumption about the shape of the income distribution within the group for which only average<lb/> income is available. Milanovic (2006) assumes a log-normal income distribution in all countries in his<lb/> measure of world inequality.<lb/></figure>

			<p>. However, one can indicatively evaluate the size of the bias, which<lb/> depends on the convexity of the Lorenz curve (the degree of intra-decile inequality), by comparing income<lb/> dispersion calculated using the OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database with a different database<lb/> which reports the income of every household such as Eurostat&apos;s and the Luxemburg Income Study (LIS).<lb/> The correlation between the national Gini coefficients calculated on OECD data and the Eurostat and LIS<lb/> numbers in table 5 is 0.97 and 0.86 respectively, whereas that between the Eurostat and LIS numbers is<lb/> 0.89. This exercise is, however, incomplete because there are differences between the databases other than<lb/> that the OECD micro base reports income per decile that will affect the correlations. OECD (2008)<lb/> Growing Unequal concludes that for most OECD-countries the difference between the data sources is<lb/> small, although it is non-negligible in some cases.<lb/></p>

It should also be kept in mind that prices probably vary much<lb/> more across Europe than the United States meaning that it need not be better to compare the EU Gini using<lb/> exchange rates and the Gini index for the United States.<lb/></p>

			<head>Within-country inequality is found to be more important than between country inequality<lb/></head>

			<p>A Theil decomposition of overall EU inequality reveals that inequality within countries explains most<lb/> of overall EU inequality. Its contribution amounts to 85% of total inequality, whereas the between-<lb/>component is at cause for the remaining 15%. This result is line with what other studies have found (e.g.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Beblo and Knaus, 2000 and Papatheodorou et al., 2003</ref>). Both studies actually attribute an even smaller<lb/> role to the between dimension and conclude that it does not even explain 10% of total inequality, probably<lb/> because they use smaller samples. 10<lb/></p>

			<head>Inequality in the EU has increased over time<lb/></head>

			<p>The results from such decomposition exercises are however sensitive<lb/> to certain methodological choices such as whether PPPs or exchange rates are used to make incomes<lb/> comparable across countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Inequality has risen in the EU sample for which comparable data from the mid-1980s is available<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 9</ref>). Extending the analysis to include Hungary is possible, but at the cost of reducing the number of<lb/> years to keep a balanced panel (Baseline 2). However, the picture remains the same. Much of the increase<lb/> appears to have happened before the turn of the century. In the early 2000s inequality appears to have<lb/> stood still or even decreased somewhat, but in recent years it is yet again on the rise. The break in 2004<lb/> unfortunately prevents further enlargements of the sample.<lb/></p>

			<p>The increasing trend in inequality in Europe is not unique. Dispersion in household disposable income<lb/> also increased in most other OECD countries between the mid-1980s and the end-2000s (OECD, 2011).<lb/> From the mid-1990s and onwards, country patterns started diverging more and the average increase<lb/> became smaller. In the United States inequality has increased substantially since the mid-1980s, and much<lb/> more as compared to the EU baseline scenario. Most of the increase happened between 1984 and 1995<lb/> when the Gini index rose from 0.34 to 0.36 and in the earliest years of this century.<lb/> Although it would be very interesting to disentangle the cyclical effects from the structural evolution<lb/> in inequality over time, in practice this is very hard to do. First of all, it is not obvious how inequality and<lb/> the cycle should interact. During a boom (bust) all incomes will increase (decrease) thus the net effect on<lb/> the Gini index is a priori undetermined. Financial market developments are however likely to impact<lb/> capital income in particular which is highly concentrated in the upper end of the distribution. Secondly,<lb/> even if there was a clear link between income dispersion and the cycle, policies and institutions are likely<lb/> to respond to the cycle so as to mitigate the impact on inequality making it very hard to evaluate the actual<lb/> cyclical component.<lb/></p>

			<head>EU enlargements, especially that of Eastern Europe, have contributed to rising inequality<lb/></head>

			<p>Expansions of the European Union over the period increased inequality. Adding Spain and Portugal<lb/> that joined the Union in 1986 as well as Austria, Finland and Sweden that joined in 1995, to the sample in<lb/> the mid-1990s increases the Gini indicator to 0.30 compared to 0.29 when only the 10 countries that where<lb/> a part of the European Union in 1985 are considered. The p9/p1 is on the contrary slightly reduced. The<lb/> increase in the Gini is, however, only due to the expansion in 1986, as the inclusion of Austria, Finland and<lb/> Sweden left inequality unchanged or even induced a slight decline. The expansion in 2004 led to a more<lb/> significant increase in inequality; adding the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia to<lb/> the sample increases the Gini in 2008 from 0.31 to 0.33. Adhesions of new member states is however not<lb/> the only explanation for rising inequality as inequality in the 8 original countries for which comparable<lb/> data is available has also risen over the past 25 years (<ref type="table">Table 10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Incomes have converged however between the &quot; catching-up &quot; countries and the rest of Europe<lb/></head>

			<p>To what extent is EU inequality driven by the developments in particular countries? Excluding the<lb/> catching up economies (Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the Eastern European countries) from the sample<lb/> reduces inequality (<ref type="table">Table 11</ref>). This is probably mostly a result of these countries being poorer than the rest<lb/> of Europe but could also be accentuated by the fact that many of these are relatively unequal countries per<lb/> se. The choice of time period is dictated by the breaks in the data series, but fortunately also coincides with<lb/> the period over which most of the catching-up process is likely to have taken place (mid-1980s to 2000 for<lb/> Southern Europe and from mid-2000s for Eastern Europe).<lb/> The effect of excluding both waves of catching up economies does narrow over time, indicating<lb/> income convergence between Ireland, Portugal and Spain with the rest of the EU from the mid-80s until<lb/> the turn of the century and likewise for the Eastern European countries from the mid-2000s. The latter<lb/> seems to have happened mostly because of the strong income growth in Poland.<lb/></p>

			<p>Isolating the between-country component of EU inequality by looking at the dispersion in mean<lb/> national incomes over time allows a more formal assessment of whether or not income convergence has<lb/> taken place and the extent to which this is due to poorer countries catching up. However, this reduces the<lb/> number of observations greatly, so the Gini index is not calculated because of a severe small-sample bias<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Deltas, 2001</ref>). The variance (ratio of standard deviation to mean) in decile income decreased both from<lb/> the mid-1980s to 2000 (though most notably until the mid-1990s), and from the mid-2000s until 2008. This<lb/> reduction in the between component appears to be a pure catching up effect, as the variance increased<lb/> somewhat over the same periods when Spain, Ireland, Portugal and subsequently the East-European<lb/> countries were excluded from the samples.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>Using the OECD inequality and poverty data, this paper shows a general pattern since the mid-1980s<lb/> in European countries at the national level where top deciles capture an increasing part of the income<lb/> generated in the economy, while the poorest 10% are losing ground. A similar evolution has occurred in<lb/> most of the OECD area, including the United States where the rise in top incomes has been particularly<lb/> strong. A few European countries stand out from this pattern, leading to diverging evolutions in income<lb/> dispersion over time where inequality rising in some countries (especially strongly in Sweden and the<lb/> Netherlands), and decreasing in others (Greece and Hungary). There are good reasons why one should<lb/> measure inequality in the European Union not only as a (population weighted) average of inequality in<lb/> each member state, but also for the Union as a whole. While redistribution policies in the European Union<lb/> are mostly under the authority of national governments, EU regional policy is a union-wide policy aiming<lb/> at reducing inequality between regions making it important to assess its potential contribution to<lb/> inequalities. Concerns for social cohesion in the Union, including inequality, also appear now to be gaining<lb/> momentum.<lb/> Considering inequality in the European Union as a whole allows to see what the differences in income<lb/> growth per decile has implied for inequality between individuals in the European Union, given that in<lb/> parallel to changes in the distribution of income within countries, some economies have grown more<lb/> rapidly than others. Inspired by among others Brandolini (2007) and Milanovic (2002), this paper<lb/> constructed an aggregate measure of EU-wide inequality that takes into account both within and between<lb/> inequality. Inequality in Europe is found to be high, though clearly below the level in the United States.<lb/> Furthermore, EU income inequality is found to have increased over the past 25 years, albeit at a slower<lb/> pace since 2000.<lb/> Evidence of income convergence through the so-called catching up effect was found, which in itself<lb/> should have reduced inequality. Country adhesions over the period, and particularly the expansion to<lb/> Eastern Europe in 2004 did however act in the opposite direction, as both in the mid 1990s and end 2000s<lb/> inequality was higher when the new countries were added. Expansions of the Union is however not the<lb/> only explanation for the rise in income dispersion over the period since inequality also rose within the 8<lb/> countries in the sample that were part of the European Union in 1985.<lb/></p>

			<head>ANNEX: MICRO-VERSUS MACRO DATA<lb/></head>

			<p>National account data only provide national averages, and can therefore only be used to determine the<lb/> difference in mean per capita income between countries, and not within country inequality. Since this<lb/> report aims to measure all income inequality, micro data must necessarily be used.<lb/> A problem with micro data is representativeness. Household surveys cover only a sample of the total<lb/> population and the probability of including the few people that hold a significant part of total household<lb/> income is low. The problem is worsened since the rich have incentives to underreport their income for<lb/> taxation reasons. At the other end of the scale household surveys are also likely to under represent the<lb/> poorest. Two results follow: Using income data from household surveys is likely to lead researchers to<lb/> underestimate the level of inequality and it is likely not to pick up on substantial income growth in the very<lb/> top of the distribution.<lb/></p>

			<p>Add to this other conceptual differences beyond the question of sampling and underreporting between<lb/> micro-and macro data and it is no wonder that the growth in total disposable income is different as<lb/> <ref type="table">Table A</ref>			<figure>.1 illustrates. Some income components, such as employer social contributions, are accounted for<lb/> in national account data but not included in income data from household surveys. Also, different deflators<lb/> are used for the two data sources to pass from nominal to real income growth. National account data use<lb/> the expenditure price index (Fischer-index) whereas in household survey data the consumer price index<lb/> (Laspeyres-index) is used to deflate income data. In the former the weights assigned to each good are<lb/> updated more frequently to eliminate upper-level substitution bias which means that all else equal it will<lb/> grow slower over time.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The difference between the two data sources is particularly large for the United States. Although all<lb/> nominal income components contributed to this, the role of self-employment income has played a key role.<lb/> This income component is likely to be underestimated in survey data, and indeed its growth over time has<lb/> been much stronger according to US macro data. In addition to this government health care social benefits,<lb/> which are not included in the household income survey data for the United States, have grown rapidly over<lb/> the past decade.<lb/> Applying the income shares of each decile from micro data to total household disposable income from<lb/> macro data gives an indication of how the discrepancy in macro versus micro data income growth affects<lb/> the results in the main paper. The relative orders of magnitude of income growth per decile for a given<lb/> country stay broadly the same as before. However, the fact that income growth per decile across countries<lb/> is now somewhat different from before could make a difference for between-country inequality.<lb/> Such an exercise remains however partial. Scaling up total income by using national account data<lb/> automatically increases absolute dispersions in monetary incomes. However since the evolution in income<lb/> shares remains the same, it is not surprising that the country results are not much changed. Most aggregate<lb/> inequality measures (including the Gini) are scale-invariant, and so per definition the within-country<lb/> component of inequality is not affected. Also, because micro and macro data are so conceptually different,<lb/> one should be vary of using them simultaneously (<ref type="biblio">Deaton, 2005</ref>). Finally, there are caveats with national<lb/> accounts data as well, so column two in</p>
