Rousset, K. Deconinck, H. Jeong and M. von Lampe <lb/>While public regulation in food and agriculture is attracting attention at both policy and <lb/>research level for their potential implications on international food trade, policy implications <lb/>of agricultural standards – understood to be legally not mandatory and hence voluntary – are <lb/>much less well understood. Yet, environmental and organic standards have grown in <lb/>importance in agriculture and agri-food chains, making also their potential trade effects more <lb/>relevant. In this context, understanding the linkages between governments and standards has <lb/>become a key element in the debate. <lb/>This report analyses possible roles of public authorities in the area of environmental and <lb/>organic standards, including policy objectives, options for interaction and means for the use <lb/>of standards for achieving public policy goals. It identifies the main objectives behind <lb/>government activity on environmental and organic standards in the area of consumer <lb/>protection and fraud prevention, the enabling of functioning food markets and the <lb/>improvement of efficiency in the design, implementation and monitoring of public policies. <lb/>Countries have taken very different approaches towards dealing with standards on organic <lb/>agriculture which frequently, though not always, are seen as a subset of environment-related <lb/>standards. Choices for organic standards range between market self-regulation and the <lb/>development of government-owned public standards. More generally, the level of public <lb/>intervention often reflects OECD governments&apos; perception on the environmental benefits of <lb/>organic agriculture itself. <lb/>Keywords: Private standards, environmental standards, organic standards, environmental <lb/>policies, organic regulation, organic agriculture, agricultural trade. <lb/>JEL: M38, Q13, Q17, Q58 <lb/>This work has benefited from substantial input from officials of agricultural and <lb/>environment ministries, from private standard owners in OECD countries, Argentina and the <lb/>European Commission.

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Environmental standards are understood to be sets of rules, guidelines or characteristics <lb/>for products or related processes and production methods with which compliance is not <lb/>legally mandated and, hence, voluntary. They have grown in importance in agriculture and <lb/>agri-food chains as food consumers and societies have expressed increased expectations <lb/>regarding the quality of food products and the environmental performance in their production. <lb/>In addition, food processors and retailers increasingly use standards and certification to ensure <lb/>required quality characteristics along the supply chain as well as for differentiating products <lb/>and segmenting food markets. <lb/>This study examines possible roles of public authorities in the area of environmental and <lb/>organic standards, with the ambition to answer three related questions: <lb/> What objectives can be pursued by government interaction with environmental and <lb/>organic standards? <lb/> What options are available to governments for taking a role in environmental and <lb/>organic standards? <lb/> How can governments make use of environmental and organic standards for achieving <lb/>public policy objectives? <lb/>This report is based on an extensive literature review, a number of case studies on specific <lb/>environmental and organic standards in different countries, and an OECD-wide survey on <lb/>organic agriculture standards. 1 <lb/>A key role of governments in the area of environmental and organic standards is to ensure <lb/>the proper functioning of markets for both food and the certification of food. This in particular <lb/>includes the protection of consumers and the avoidance of excessive transaction costs: <lb/>Protecting consumers and preventing fraud and free-riding by competitors represent a key <lb/>rationale for public authorities for intervening with standards. This goal is pursued mainly <lb/>through the protection of trademarks and brands, the banning of fraudulent or misleading <lb/>claims, or the obligation of private companies to disclose certain information. <lb/>Reducing transaction costs and facilitating market access for all producers also represent <lb/>an important motivation for public intervention. This can be achieved by harmonising existing <lb/>standards, stimulating the creation of standards or developing a public standard. <lb/>In addition, governments can make use of environmental and organic standards to <lb/>improve efficiency in the design, implementation and monitoring of public policies. This can <lb/>include building regulations on existing private standards; endorsing standards, stimulating <lb/>1. <lb/>The present report is complemented by its Annexes, available from the OECD website at <lb/>[www.oecd.org/tad/ntm/voluntary-environmental-standards-in-agriculture-2015-annexes.pdf]. In <lb/>addition to the full survey on organic agriculture standards (Annex 3) and details on the <lb/>individual case studies on environmental standards (Annex 4), it also provides a glossary of <lb/>terms (Annex 1) and more detailed information on standards and standard-related government <lb/>interventions (Annex 2). <lb/></body>

			<body>the growth of the certified sector, or using standards as an option to comply with regulations; <lb/>and the recognition of private audits and certification for compliance to policy requirements. <lb/>Costs to taxpayers can be reduced by relying on existing standards or their certification <lb/>systems. Benefits can also include the reduction of farmer transaction costs through reduced <lb/>public monitoring of compliance with policies and regulations. However, there is a potential <lb/>risk to lose control. To mitigate that, it is important to develop procedures to screen private <lb/>standards of the level required for general interest purpose, as well as to maintain mechanisms <lb/>to oversee operators and auditors. <lb/>Concerning organic agriculture standards, which frequently are seen as a subset of <lb/>environment-related standards, countries have taken different approaches. The choices range <lb/>from largely allowing private standards to self-regulate the market for organic food products <lb/>with intervention mainly limited to exports of domestic produce, to the development of a <lb/>public standard on organic food products. In addition to ensuring well-functioning markets for <lb/>organic food by protecting consumers and facilitating trade, more active intervention by many <lb/>OECD governments also reflects the perceived environmental (and hence societal) benefits of <lb/>organic agriculture and frequently includes specific support provided to the producers of <lb/>certified organic food products. <lb/></body>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Voluntary environmental standards have grown in importance in agriculture and agri-food <lb/>chains. 2 Standards may offer opportunities and challenges for producers, companies, and <lb/>governments. For some farmers, they could facilitate access to lucrative markets and supply <lb/>chains, while for others, unable to meet the requirements, they could restrain market access. <lb/>From the perspective of the processors, traders and food retailers, standards and their related <lb/>labels offer opportunities such as quality assurance and product differentiation. <lb/>There are two main reasons why governments may want to engage with voluntary <lb/>standards. The first reason is to improve the functioning of food markets, particularly by <lb/>protecting consumers from false and misleading claims. The second reason is to achieve other <lb/>public interest objectives by making use of standards in their policy-mix. For instance, <lb/>voluntary standards and their certification systems could reduce the cost to governments of <lb/>carrying out inspections. <lb/>The present study aims at helping governments to improve their understanding of the <lb/>policy implications of voluntary environmental standards by documenting experiences across <lb/>OECD countries. The first chapter defines some key terms and motivates the choice of <lb/>voluntary environmental standards. Subsequently, it also provides an overview of different <lb/>standards in agriculture, as well as a brief description of their importance in OECD countries. <lb/>The remainder of the report is structured around the two policy questions regarding <lb/>voluntary standards. <lb/>Section 2, &quot; Regulating Standards, &quot; discusses the efficiency rationale for standards, and <lb/>outlines the different policy options for governments in this regard. The emphasis here is on <lb/>making markets work better by resolving information problems. These policy options are <lb/>illustrated using evidence on organic regulations from Member countries. <lb/>Section 3, &quot; Using Standards, &quot; discusses how governments can use standards to implement <lb/>policy objectives other than resolving information problems. The different possible <lb/>interactions are illustrated using selected case studies on environmental policies as well as <lb/>evidence on interactions between standards and policy objectives for organic agriculture in <lb/>Member countries. Section 4 presents conclusions of the study. <lb/>The analysis in this report is based on an extensive review of literature, a survey on <lb/>organic agriculture standards in the OECD and a number of case studies. <lb/>Based on the framework for the analysis of government involvement with standards, the <lb/>Secretariat conducted an OECD wide survey on organic agriculture. The survey intends to <lb/>highlight the scope for government involvement in the definition, implementation, and <lb/>enforcement of organic standards, as well as the rationale for governmental support to the <lb/>organic certified supply chains to pursue policy interests. The survey covers three topics: <lb/>i) regulations on organic agriculture and foodstuffs, ii) public policies towards organic <lb/>agriculture and food markets, and iii) private organic standards (See the list of questions and <lb/>the full results of the survey in Annex 3 3 ). <lb/>2. <lb/>As explained further below, throughout this document the term &quot; standard &quot; is understood to <lb/>denote a set of rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and <lb/>production methods with which compliance is not legally mandated. As such, using the term <lb/> &quot; voluntary standard &quot; is redundant. However, the term is used differently by various authors. In <lb/>order to improve clarity, this report therefore accepts such redundancies at various places. <lb/>3. <lb/>The Annexes are available for download from the OECD website at <lb/>www.oecd.org/tad/ntm/voluntary-environmental-standards-in-agriculture-2015-annexes.pdf. <lb/></body>

			<body>In addition, eight case studies were undertaken in four countries: France, Korea, the <lb/>Netherlands, and Switzerland. The cases discussed provide insights on the key question <lb/>behind Section 3: how governments can make use of voluntary standards to achieve policy <lb/>objectives in a more cost-effective fashion. The full cases are available in country chapters in <lb/>Annex 4. <lb/>1. <lb/>Environmental standards in agriculture <lb/>Based on a literature review, this chapter defines key terms, motivates the choice of <lb/>voluntary environmental standards and provides a brief overview of standards related to <lb/>organic agriculture, quality assurance 4 and &apos;sustainable&apos; agriculture. <lb/>Key definitions <lb/>A few key concepts, which have been used frequently and differently in the literature, are <lb/>defined below. These include the terms &apos;voluntary&apos; versus &apos;mandatory&apos;, &apos;standards&apos; versus <lb/>&apos;technical regulations&apos;, and &apos;private&apos; versus &apos;public&apos;. The usual terms used in the context of <lb/>standardisation and certification are provided in a glossary (Annex 1) and the standardisation <lb/>process is discussed in more detail in Annex 2. <lb/>Voluntary versus mandatory <lb/>The definitions of the terms &apos;voluntary&apos; and &apos;mandatory&apos; correspond to their common <lb/>understanding, as referred to in dictionaries or other sources, for example in the academic <lb/>literature. More specifically, and following OECD (2011), the following definitions are used: <lb/> Voluntary: without any legal obligation. <lb/> Mandatory: required or commanded by authority; obligatory, compulsory. <lb/>Henson (2004) suggests that all normative documents may be located along a continuum <lb/>characterised by the users&apos; freedom of choice regarding non-compliance. Accordingly, certain <lb/>voluntary standards could be analysed as de facto mandatory standards for market <lb/>participants, when particular sets of specifications gains sufficient market share such that they <lb/>acquire authority or influence. Indeed, historically, public authorities introduced regulations <lb/>and private entities applied voluntary standards. Over time, public authorities also developed <lb/>voluntary standards and private firms with market power have implemented standards that <lb/>became de facto mandatory for other market participants (OECD, 2005). However, using the <lb/>terms in this &quot; continuous &quot; manner risks losing the clarity of the legal meaning of the words. <lb/>As used in this study, the word mandatory is related to legal binding force. <lb/>Standards versus technical regulations <lb/>An important distinction is that between standards and technical regulations. Following <lb/>the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement, the following definitions are used: <lb/> Standard: Document approved by a recognised body, that provides, for common and <lb/>repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and <lb/>production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory. It may also include or <lb/>deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling <lb/>4. <lb/>Quality assurance is the &quot; part of quality management focused on providing confidence that <lb/>quality requirements will be fulfilled &quot; (ISO, 2000). Farm assurance is the application of quality <lb/>assurance principles to pre farm gate operations. <lb/></body>

			<body>requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method (WTO, 1995, <lb/>emphasis added). <lb/> Technical regulation: A technical regulation is a document which lays down product <lb/>characteristics or their related processes and production methods, including the <lb/>applicable administrative provisions, with which compliance is mandatory. It may also <lb/>include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling <lb/>requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method (WTO, 1995, <lb/>emphasis added). <lb/>Following this definition, the two types of normative documents are very similar, possibly <lb/>exactly equal, in terms of contents, but different in the enforcement of requirements. Therefore <lb/>a standard may turn into a technical regulation if made mandatory. As regards to the <lb/>enforcement of the requirements, technical regulations are ultimately enforced by criminal or <lb/>administrative courts, whereas standards are enforced by public and private certifications <lb/>bodies (Henson and Humphrey, 2010). Their content may originate in the private or public <lb/>sector, but what make regulations different from standards is their enforcement mechanisms. <lb/>Private versus public <lb/>The distinction between private and public standards relates to their ownership. The term <lb/> &quot; public standard &quot; defines standards established by governments or public agencies, while all <lb/>others are defined as private standards. Therefore, all technical requirements may be defined <lb/>according to two dimensions, ownership and enforcement (Table 1). <lb/>Some standards could evolve as a method to facilitate compliance with related regulations <lb/>and some regulations could refer to standards as their technical requirements. Sometimes, <lb/>widespread standards may become incorporated in regulations. Moreover, governments, non-<lb/>profit organisations and private sectors have been indirectly involved in joint initiatives in <lb/>recent years, for example in the fisheries sector (OECD, 2011). In this way, public standards, <lb/>regulations and private standards operate in parallel, mutually influencing each other. <lb/>Finally, standards established by inter-governmental organisations are an important area <lb/>to look at. They are distinct from private standards because they originate from an agreement <lb/>between governments and they reflect public objectives rather than commercial ones. On the <lb/>other hand, they are also different from governmental standards because inter-governmental <lb/>organisations do not have the enforcing power of governments. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Why environmental standards? <lb/>The study focuses on voluntary environmental standards in agriculture, including but not <lb/>limited to organic agriculture 5 . Increasing consumer demands for food quality and production <lb/>sustainability are the main drivers of voluntary standards in agriculture. In addition, standards <lb/>and third-party certifications are an important feature of supply chain management, as they <lb/>allow flexibility in procurement while ensuring required quality characteristics along the <lb/>chain (OECD, 2006). Finally, for major agri-food processors and retailers, standards <lb/>contribute to protect brand equity and are part of their social responsibility commitments. <lb/>They allow to respond to new demands from the civil society (Tallontire, 2007) and to attract <lb/>socially responsible investment (Hartmann, 2011). Large buyers influence farmers and other <lb/>suppliers upstream in the food chain to adjust to their sustainability requirements. In the end, <lb/>the pressure for the uptake of environmental standards comes from several stakeholders, in <lb/>particular consumers, NGOs, shareholders and financial actors. Environmental standards <lb/>provide a good case to study the policy implications of standards for several reasons. First, <lb/>environmental attributes are increasingly demanded by food consumers (Millock and Nauges, <lb/>2013). However, these characteristics are difficult for consumers to assess, leading to possible <lb/>information asymmetry problems. In response, a large number of private voluntary <lb/>environmental standards have emerged alongside public regulations. Countries differ in the <lb/>relative importance of these private voluntary standards and public regulations. <lb/>A second reason for studying environmental standards is that most countries have explicit <lb/>environmental policy objectives. This creates possibilities for using standards as a tool to <lb/>implement policies. For instance, governments could use private standards as a cost-effective <lb/>instrument for promoting sustainable development in agriculture, reducing the negative <lb/>impacts of farming, making more efficient use of natural resources and delivering public <lb/>goods to the society. <lb/>This study pays specific attention to public policies regarding organic agriculture. Organic <lb/>agriculture was chosen for two reasons. First, unlike some other environmental standards <lb/>discussed in the study (e.g. Bonsucro, RSPO, Rainforest Alliance), organic agriculture <lb/>standards are relevant for domestic supply chains and they are important for trade with non-<lb/>OECD countries. Second, the concept of organic agriculture is relatively clearly delineated. <lb/>Unlike some concepts that may be meaningful for some members and not for others <lb/>(e.g. &apos;integrated production&apos;, &apos;conservation agriculture&apos;) or that may be interpreted in different <lb/>ways because of a lack of an agreed definition (e.g. &apos;good agricultural practices&apos;), organic <lb/>agriculture is a mode of production widely recognised within OECD countries (OECD, 2003). <lb/>Moreover, organic agriculture is defined in the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission <lb/>(CAC, 1999) and in several bilateral arrangements for equivalency between country-regulated <lb/>organic standards (e.g. Korea-US, US-Japan, EU-US, Canada-US, Canada-EU, EU-<lb/>Switzerland). <lb/>Governments may take different approaches on environmental standards. They may <lb/>regulate food labelling to avoid misleading or deceptive claims. They may support or promote <lb/>the use of standards through public procurement, subsidising compliance costs, fiscal <lb/>exemptions and other incentives. OECD (2013a) identified twenty-four observed roles of <lb/>governments, from public procurement to regulatory fulfilment, including &quot; soft-hand &quot; <lb/>interventions such as the funding of standardising bodies activities. For other governments, <lb/>voluntary standards remain a private sector matter unrelated to governmental intervention. <lb/>5. <lb/>Note that for some stakeholders, like Canada, organic agriculture standards may not be seen as <lb/>environmental standards. Moreover, the survey of OECD governments shows that several <lb/>member countries are neutral about the environmental benefits of organic agriculture, for <lb/>example Australia and New Zealand (See Annex 3). <lb/></body>

			<body>Studying environmental standards can thus help to understand to what extent and for what <lb/>reasons governments are regulating voluntary standards, supporting the development of <lb/>standards, and eventually making use of existing standards to implement public policies and <lb/>efficiently pursue public interests. <lb/>As the approach of government towards environmental standards in agriculture will <lb/>depend on policy goals, it is not relevant to search for &quot; golden rules &quot; regarding OECD <lb/>countries&apos; involvement with standards. Moreover, the country-specific context matters, such <lb/>as the nature of existing voluntary standards, their stringency and their suitability for <lb/>achieving policy objectives, the level of trust between governmental bodies and the private <lb/>sector (Garcia Martinez et al, 2007), legal tradition and administrative practices (Humphrey, <lb/>2012), as well as historical contingencies and path-dependence. <lb/>Diversity of environmental standards <lb/>Environmental standards may be defined as &quot; standards for materials, products and <lb/>production processes to ensure that negative impacts on the environment are minimal or kept <lb/>within certain limits &quot; (Dankers, 2003). In agriculture as in other sectors, environmental <lb/>standards have different ambitions and promote various processes and production methods to <lb/>promote sustainability. <lb/>Environmentally-friendly practices in agriculture include soil conservation (e.g., <lb/>conservation tillage, cover crops), water conservation (e.g., buffer areas to minimise non-<lb/>point source pollution), the prohibition of hazardous chemicals, integrated pest management, <lb/>nutrient management (e.g. manure application methods), waste recycling, and the <lb/>maintenance of agro-ecological infrastructures for biodiversity. Moreover, different holistic <lb/>approaches intend to integrate several individual practices into production systems, in order to <lb/>benefit from complementarities in the agro-ecological system, while achieving other <lb/>objectives, such as improvement in animal welfare. Among those, &apos;organic agriculture&apos;, <lb/>&apos;biodynamic agriculture&apos;, and &apos;integrated production&apos; have been heavily formalised into <lb/>voluntary standards. <lb/>Environmental standards may cover a wide spectrum of criteria or favour specific topics. <lb/>According to the last standard benchmark published in the State of Sustainability Initiatives <lb/>(SSI), the IFOAM organic standard has a comprehensive coverage in all areas of reporting <lb/>except one, greenhouse gas. Conversely, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) 6 <lb/>appears to be the most comprehensive standard for greenhouse gas reduction, but it is weaker <lb/>in other areas, e.g. the use of synthetic inputs and biodiversity. Fairtrade (FLO), a standard <lb/>developed initially to promote social equity, has incorporated several environmental <lb/>requirements, but its coverage of environmental issues remains &quot; average &quot; in most areas (SSI, <lb/>2014). In addition to coverage, standards have different provisions and criteria to be fulfilled, <lb/>which make them difficult to benchmark in practice. <lb/>There are different ways to classify environmental standards in agriculture, through their <lb/>channel (Business to Business, Business to Consumer), their product or geographical scope, <lb/>their communication content (when a label or any other information is involved, i.e. &apos;natural&apos;, <lb/>&apos;organic&apos;, &apos;sustainable&apos;), or even according to leadership in their development and promotion <lb/>(government, retailers, farmers, conservation NGOs, etc.) (OECD, 2013a). For the sake of <lb/>convenience, the numerous product and production method standards related to environment <lb/>are grouped into three categories that reflect successive generations of initiatives: organic <lb/>agriculture standards, farm assurance standards, and commodity sustainability standards. <lb/>6. <lb/>Previously known as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. The RSB expanded its scope in <lb/>2013 to cover biomaterials. <lb/></body>

			<body>Organic agriculture standards <lb/>Organic agriculture standards relate to processes and production methods based on the <lb/>principles of &quot; organic agriculture &quot; , defined by the FAO as &quot; a holistic production management <lb/>system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, <lb/>biological cycles, and soil biological activity &quot; (See Glossary of organic agriculture, FAO, <lb/>2009). Other definitions of organic agriculture (e.g. from IFAOM and several private standard <lb/>setters) include social and ethical issues, for example fair labour practices. Organic standards <lb/>are developed by a diversity of stakeholders, including farmer and consumer associations, <lb/>charities, certification bodies and governments. Organic standards aim at differentiating <lb/>products and segmenting markets, with environmental claims transmitted to households <lb/>through a food label. <lb/>The market for organic food and drinks was worth USD 63 billion in 2011. It has <lb/>expanded by 170% since 2002 (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013). Demand for organic products comes <lb/>mainly from North America and Europe, together with more than 90% of retail sales. The <lb/>United States, Germany and France are the three countries with the largest organic consumer <lb/>markets. Higher per capita consumption is found in Switzerland (USD 250 per capita per <lb/>year), Denmark (USD 226) and Luxembourg (USD 187). <lb/>In terms of production, estimates of agricultural land under organic production worldwide <lb/>in 2011, including land in-conversion, vary between 29.9 million (FAOSTAT) and <lb/>37.2 million hectares (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013) (Table 2). According to the OECD Compendium <lb/>of Agri-environmental Indicators (OECD, 2013b), the OECD area represents 24.7 million ha <lb/>of agricultural land area under certified organic management in 2010. The OECD area <lb/>accounts for the majority of organic production and organic food consumption. <lb/>According to the FiBL/IFOAM survey, in 2013, 86 countries implemented regulations on <lb/>organic agriculture and foodstuffs, and 26 are in the process of drafting legislation. The <lb/>survey carried out by the Secretariat confirms that all OECD member countries have <lb/>implemented some official programme as regard to organic agriculture, although the approach <lb/>towards regulation differs from one country to another (See Annex 3). This is also the case of <lb/>most emerging economies: Argentina, Brazil, the People&apos;s Republic of China, India and <lb/>Indonesia. The Russian Federation and South Africa are in the process of drafting <lb/>legislation (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013). <lb/>Organic regulations generally require the use of a governmental standard to claim <lb/> &quot; organic &quot; , the standard being directly incorporated into the legislation (as in the European <lb/>Union) or referred to in the regulations (as in Canada). Compliance with the standard is only <lb/>mandatory if the producer chooses to label a product as organic (Dankers, 2003). It is not <lb/>mandatory to farm. Moreover, for compound products, regulations require a minimal <lb/>percentage of organic ingredients. <lb/>Private organic standards have been developed decades before governmental regulations, <lb/>and public standards are often originated from private standards. The Demeter biodynamic <lb/>label and the first standards have been introduced in Germany as early as 1928. The Soil <lb/>Association, a British charity founded in 1946 published its first standards in 1967. IFOAM, a <lb/>non-governmental organisation founded in 1972 published their basic standards in 1980 <lb/>(Dankers, 2003). Private standards are active in many OECD countries and are significant <lb/>(more than 20% of organic farms) in Austria, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden <lb/>and Switzerland. In most cases, they include more requirements than national regulations. For <lb/>example, in Member States of the European Union, they often emphasise the provenance of <lb/>materials and animals used in farm production. They also extend to non-agricultural activities <lb/>such as aquaculture, woodland and health and beauty products (Gibbon, 2008). <lb/></body>

			<body>As regards to organic food imported from developing countries, a trend is the double <lb/>certification as organic and compliant with the standard of Fairtrade International (FLO), for <lb/>example most of the fair-trade coffee sold in the United States is also organic. Private organic <lb/>standards have also directly incorporated fair-trade requirements in their criteria. In France, <lb/>the Bioéquitable label is based on organic rules and on Ecocert ESR, a fair-trade standard <lb/>developed by an organic certification body. <lb/>Table 2.

Farm assurance standards are third-party accredited standards, <lb/>which are covering environmental as well as non-environmental criteria, mainly hygiene and <lb/>product traceability. Farm assurance standards are based on good agricultural practices (GAP) <lb/>and the application of Hazard Analysis at Critical Control Points (HACCP) to primary <lb/>production, for pre-farm gate operations. They are also referred as farm assurance schemes or <lb/> &quot; GAP standards &quot; . <lb/>GLOBALGAP is an initiative from the food industry, founded as EurepGAP in 1997 by <lb/>the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group (EUREP). The association declares a substantial <lb/>number of certified producers worldwide: 123 115 in December 2012 (of which 75% in <lb/>Europe), up from around 35 000 in 2005 (FoodPLUS, 2012). Launched by the National <lb/>Farmers&apos; Union, Assured Food Standards (AFS) is the largest farm assurance standard in the <lb/>United Kingdom with about 78 000 certified farms; the &quot; Red Tractor &quot; certification covers <lb/>food safety, animal welfare and to a lesser extent environmental matters. More than 10 000 <lb/>producers worldwide are certified under the Nurture scheme developed by UK retailer Tesco <lb/>(Cox, 2007). In France, there were 25 892 producers engaged in retailer Carrefour&apos;s Quality <lb/>Line certification by the end of 2011. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Previous OECD work on &quot; private standards &quot; focused on the drivers from the point of <lb/>view of retailers and agri-food companies. More specifically, it attempted to capture the <lb/>economic and regulatory incentives for firms to develop and to adopt standards, and the <lb/>possible implications for agri-food chain competitiveness, trade, and public policies (OECD, <lb/>2006). In the study, rising consumer expectations regarding food were identified as a key <lb/>driver of private standards, whether or not they are communicated to consumers through <lb/>VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 13 <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>labels. For large retailers, the use of a third-party certification saves production and <lb/>transaction costs, and sustains some supply flexibility, in a context of increasingly global <lb/>sourcing of agricultural commodities. Another strong driver is the firm&apos;s reputation: <lb/>interviews with major global retailers confirm that reputation is a strategic asset, built and <lb/>protected through the provision of consistent quality and safety standards to consumers <lb/>(OECD, 2006). <lb/>While the first standards developed by retailers to manage their supply (e.g. Tesco, <lb/>Carrefour) have been set up before the high profile food scares of the 1990s, increasing <lb/>consumer expectations and retailer&apos;s&apos; willingness to prevent against commercial risk <lb/>undoubtedly fostered the growth of farm assurance standards. In the OECD survey of <lb/>retailers, environmental and animal welfare criteria were reported as less crucial than food <lb/>safety, quality, social and labour standards. However, as regards to environment, the surveyed <lb/>companies reported that the standards they require were &quot; significantly higher &quot; (45%) or <lb/> &quot; slightly higher &quot; (33%) than governmental mandatory regulations. In addition, environment <lb/>was expected to gain importance over the years (OECD, 2006). <lb/>Consequently, today, most farm assurance certifications have introduced an <lb/>environmental component, giving priority to one topic, such as the sustainable use of inputs <lb/>(pesticides, fertilisers, water, and energy), waste management, or they are aiming to cover <lb/>multiple sets of provisions. Contrary to organic standards, these standards generally do not <lb/>provide consumers with their sustainability claims. <lb/>Several authors argue that rather than generating a price premium, farm assurance <lb/>standards are developed as a pre-competitive tool and provide indirect benefits to primary <lb/>producers, such as increased or secured sales to retailers and improved farm management. For <lb/>farmers in developing countries, they may enhance access to high-value chains, although <lb/>some studies provide a more nuanced picture, with heterogeneous impact on producers (ITC, <lb/>2011; Loconto and Dankers, 2014). <lb/>Commodity sustainability standards <lb/>While commodity sustainability standards have multiplied over the last ten years, their <lb/>roots trace back to the fair-trade label Max Havelaar Keurmerk established in 1988 and the <lb/>Rainforest Alliance certification (formerly ECO-OK) developed for cash crops in 1990 <lb/>(Dankers, 2003). Subsequently, in the coffee sector, Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance have <lb/>been followed by initiatives from coffee buyers (Starbuck&apos;s C.A.F.E. Practices) and NGOs <lb/>(UTZ Certified) (Ruben and Zuniga, 2011). <lb/>In the early 2000s, a series of single-commodity standards for globally-traded products <lb/>have emerged. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has been initiated in 2002 <lb/>under the umbrella of the World Wildlife Fund and driven by concerns over the expansion of <lb/>production of oil palm in Malaysia and Indonesia, with potential threat to biodiversity and <lb/>local communities (Schouten et al., 2012). The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) <lb/>developed a first version of the standard in 2008. RSB has its origins in the growing critics <lb/>over biofuels voiced in policy fora and the civil society (Moïsé and Steenblik, 2011; Ponte, <lb/>2014). Similarly, the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) aimed at addressing the <lb/>problem of sustainable production in Latin America and Asia, with a first version of the <lb/>standard published in 2010. Bonsucro (previously Better Sugar Cane Initiative), a standard for <lb/>sugarcane and ethanol production, was launched the same year. <lb/>All of the commodity standards above include economic, environmental and social <lb/>criteria (IISD/IIED, 2014). The standard owners set requirements and approve certifiers, <lb/>which must have an accreditation for conducting certification from a national accreditation <lb/>body. They are sometimes called &quot; multi-stakeholder &quot; initiatives as they stress the <lb/>participation of different stakeholders, from business and civil society, including farmers, the <lb/>14 – VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/></note>

			<body>governance of the standard aiming at promoting dialog, best practices, transparency and <lb/>inclusiveness. Standard setting is organised through constituent groups or chambers, with a <lb/>number of seats for each category of stakeholder, e.g. farmers, processors, right-based NGOs, <lb/>environmental NGOs, smallholder farmer organisations, certification bodies. However, while <lb/>some authors argue that these initiatives are a democratic answer to sustainability challenges, <lb/>others point to asymmetries and privileged access of &quot; powerful &quot; stakeholders such as buyers <lb/>from the North (Cheyns, 2011; Schouten et al., 2012). <lb/>The commodity sustainability standards are implemented in developing and emerging <lb/>countries, with regional dominance: Africa for UTZ and Rainforest Alliance, Africa and Latin <lb/>America for Fairtrade, Asia for RSPO, and South America for Bonsucro and RTRS (Table 3). <lb/>Table 3.

In 2012, <lb/>RTRS certification reached 320 kha of soybean from 144 kha in 2011 (Argentina, Brazil, <lb/>Paraguay and India). Bonsucro reported 686 kha of certified sugarcane worldwide in 2012 <lb/>(IISD/IIED, 2014). Certified production represented about 40% of worldwide production in <lb/>coffee in 2012, 22% in cocoa, 15% in palm oil and 12% in tea. The proportion is much lower <lb/>in cotton, bananas and sugar (3%) and soybeans (2%) (IISD/IIED, 2014). <lb/>2. <lb/>Making markets work better: Policy options for interacting with voluntary standards <lb/>For many product attributes, including environmental aspects, consumers are unable to <lb/>evaluate the claims made by producers either before or after consuming the product. The <lb/>existence of these so-called &quot; credence &quot; characteristics leads to an &quot; adverse selection &quot; <lb/>problem, where consumers distrust such claims and are unwilling to pay the premium which <lb/>would be necessary to compensate producers for the extra production costs. 7 <lb/>Given these information problems and market failures, an important policy question is to <lb/>what extent the provision of desirable attributes can be achieved using private initiatives, and <lb/>when public initiatives are useful or necessary. This chapter discusses the available policy <lb/>options. Throughout the chapter, reference is made to the results of a survey on organic <lb/>agriculture standards in the OECD (see Annex 3). <lb/>7. <lb/>See Annex 2 for a more extensive discussion of how information problems affect the functioning <lb/>of markets and for an overview of private and public initiatives in addition to the standards-<lb/>related initiatives discussed in this chapter. <lb/></body>

			<body>Regulation of information provision <lb/>An important distinction is whether a credence attribute is a &apos;good&apos; or a &apos;bad&apos;, i.e. an <lb/>attribute consumers desire in their product (e.g. fair trade) or an attribute consumers wish to <lb/>avoid (e.g. pesticides). In the absence of government initiatives, producers might falsely <lb/>advertise desirable credence attributes or neglect to inform consumers about undesirable <lb/>credence attributes of the product. The appropriate government policy depends on whether the <lb/>credence attributes are desirable or not. Governments want to induce private actors to give <lb/>accurate information about undesirable credence attributes, and prevent them from giving <lb/>false impressions about desirable credence attributes. <lb/>Mandatory disclosure <lb/>For credence attributes which are not desirable for the consumer (e.g. the presence of <lb/>pesticides), the producer has an incentive to withhold this information. To overcome this <lb/>problem, governments could mandate the disclosure of certain types of information (Caswell <lb/>and Mojduszka, 1996). A well-known example is mandatory disclosure of nutritional <lb/>information (on calories, fats, proteins, etc.) in a standardised format. <lb/>Regulating positive claims <lb/>For desirable credence attributes, the government will often ban misleading or false <lb/>advertising. Consumer protection authorities regulate labelling claims and advertisement <lb/>under laws prohibiting unsubstantial and misleading claims (e.g. claims which could create <lb/>confusion among consumers) about product and process properties. The general principle is <lb/>enumerated in Codex Alimentarius: &quot; Food should not be described or presented in a manner <lb/>that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding <lb/>its character in any respect &quot; (CAC, 1979). <lb/>Protecting market integrity <lb/>Another possible problem with private information provision is that such claims may have <lb/>negative spillover effects on other sellers. For instance, emphasizing that a product contains <lb/>no toxic ingredients may give the false impression that products from competing firms do <lb/>contain those toxic ingredients. Such a labelling strategy would give a competitive advantage <lb/>to one firm but it would undermine the confidence of the buyer in the market as a whole. <lb/>For this reason, food claims are regulated not only to protect consumers, but also to avoid <lb/>such negative spillovers. For instance, most governments do not accept food safety claims <lb/>from commercial operators. Market differentiation based on food safety is considered both <lb/>illegitimate and inefficient since there is a risk of undermining the credibility of public <lb/>sanitary regulations and, by extension, of the whole food market. Likewise, Codex <lb/>Alimentarius formally discourages &quot; claims which could give rise to doubt about the safety of <lb/>similar food or which could arouse or exploit fear in the consumer &quot; (CAC, 1979). Health <lb/>claims are also regulated by several governments. <lb/>Product differentiation based on environmental characteristics or performance has been <lb/>considered less sensitive by governments, but one may find a similar risk of eroding public <lb/>confidence in food from conventional agriculture. Moreover, the proliferation of &quot; green <lb/>washing &quot; (the practice of using environmental claims based on standards barely above <lb/>minimal legal requirements) may also confuse consumers and undermine the credibility of <lb/>existing standards. <lb/></body>

			<body>Labels and standards <lb/>For some attributes, a ban on misleading advertising in turn leads to two related problems, <lb/>i.e. how certain descriptions or claims should be defined, and how these can be verified. A law <lb/>against misleading advertising does not by itself solve the problem that a concept like <lb/> &quot; organic &quot; can be defined differently by different sellers. Moreover, even with a clear <lb/>definition and a law prohibiting false advertising it might be difficult for buyers or <lb/>competitors to verify whether sellers violated the law or not. Hence, for some attributes, <lb/>regulation against false advertising is not sufficient. <lb/>One solution to this problem is the use of labels and standards. A third party (private or <lb/>public) can establish a set of requirements and verify that a seller satisfies the requirements. <lb/>The seller could then be awarded a label which can be displayed on the product. If the label is <lb/>accurate, this transforms the credence attribute into a &quot; search &quot; attribute, since buyers can <lb/>simply look for the label when buying the good (Caswell and Mojduszka 1996). Standards <lb/>and labels may thus solve information problems to a large extent. The label communicates to <lb/>consumers that a product has the desired characteristics. <lb/>The use of labels and standards involves a number of policy decisions (Roe and Sheldon, <lb/>2007). An important question is whether standard-setting and certification should happen <lb/>under the authority of a government agency or through a private firm. It is important to note <lb/>here that setting a standard and certifying that a certain seller satisfies the criteria are in <lb/>principle two separate activities which could be undertaken by separate bodies, whether <lb/>public or private. For instance, both the process of standard-setting and certifying could be <lb/>left to the public sector. The standard could also be defined by the government, with <lb/>certification by private bodies. Conversely, government agencies could certify private <lb/>standards, e.g. as USDA is increasingly asked to do (Clayton and Preston, 2003). <lb/>Alternatively, a private company or organisation could define a certain standard, and the same <lb/>or another private body could certify that a seller satisfies the criteria of the standard. <lb/>Public or private standards? <lb/>For the case of organic food, the survey of OECD countries shows that all member <lb/>countries except New Zealand and Australia have public organic standards incorporated into <lb/>regulations. In New Zealand, there is no specific legal framework for products sold on the <lb/>domestic market, but the government administers a voluntary programme for exports. In <lb/>Australia, the organic legislation only applies to exported production, in reference to a <lb/>standard maintained by the industry. <lb/>The survey confirms that market issues have been the main spur for developing public <lb/>organic standards embedded in regulations. The protection of consumers from false claims is <lb/>the most frequently quoted motivation for organic regulations. <lb/>A question which may arise is whether, in addition to a government-backed label, other <lb/>labels will be allowed as well. For instance, in the United States all organic food certification <lb/>is overseen by the USDA, and private firms may not establish alternative definitions. <lb/>According to the findings of the survey, private organic standards co-exist with public <lb/>standards in 23 OECD countries on the 33 surveyed. 8 Although reliable and comparable <lb/>statistics on the importance of private standards are not available for all countries, private <lb/>organic standards appear to be significant in Austria (60% of organic farms), Ireland (99%), <lb/>Luxembourg (58%), the Netherlands (27%), Sweden (79%) and Switzerland (95%). <lb/>8. <lb/>The definition of private standards includes those developed by NGOs, private certifiers and <lb/>other for-profit companies, as well as those developed by officially recognised non-<lb/>governmental standardising bodies. <lb/></body>

			<body>Moreover, as there is no country-regulated standard for the domestic market in Australia and <lb/>New Zealand, all certified organic farmers producing for the domestic market are certified <lb/>according to private standards. 9 <lb/>Benefits and disadvantages of private relative to public standards <lb/>As part of their answers to the survey, some member countries have pointed out the <lb/>benefits and drawbacks of having coexisting organic regulations and private organic standards <lb/>operating in the country. <lb/>A first benefit is the possibility of product differentiation. In most OECD countries, <lb/>private standards have to comply with the legal minimum set in regulations. This means that <lb/>there are opportunities for standards higher than the country-regulated standard. For example, <lb/>the private standards that operate in Ireland set higher requirements than Council Regulation <lb/>(EC) No. 834/2007. This higher standard provides an added extra and is attractive for export <lb/>of products to continental Europe. Moreover, private standards provide additional benefits in <lb/>the market due to the standard owner&apos;s stance on specific issues such as for example animal <lb/>welfare and bio-dynamic agriculture. Some private organic standards also certify the origin of <lb/>products (e.g. Slovenia, Switzerland), which is valued by domestic and foreign consumers. <lb/>With private standards, organic producers have access to different marketing channels <lb/>through which they can singularise their products. <lb/>A second benefit mentioned by respondents was that owners of private standards may <lb/>invest in building and maintaining strong brand value, which in turn increase confidence <lb/>amongst consumers. For example, in Sweden, KRAV has been very successful in marketing <lb/>organic products. With private standards, control may be more diverse and deeper, which <lb/>yields more trust in &apos;organic&apos; claims for consumers. Finally, private standards are perceived to <lb/>bring innovation in the organic sector. If there is a need from a governmental perspective, <lb/>some requirements of private standards may be implemented into organic regulations in <lb/>further stages. Indeed, national regulations have been influenced by private organic standards <lb/>in several OECD countries. <lb/>The main drawback of private organic standards is the possibility of confusion amongst <lb/>consumers as to the dividing line between the standard and the country regulation. In the <lb/>European Union, where coexistence is allowed, it is not obvious if consumers are always <lb/>aware of the differences between the two. Moreover, certification bodies often propose their <lb/>own private standard; they are in competition with each other over what their respective <lb/>versions of the standards offer to producers. <lb/>Certification <lb/>In terms of certification according to organic regulations, 10 there is much more <lb/>heterogeneity among OECD members. 22 of the 33 OECD countries surveyed use private <lb/>9. <lb/>Note that farmers producing organic products for the New Zealand or Australian domestic <lb/>market need not to be certified. However, as it is the case elsewhere, the legislation in place in <lb/>both these countries prevents market participants from making false claims on the marketed <lb/>food. Organic products sold on the New Zealand domestic market are sold subject to the Fair <lb/>Trading Act, which requires truth in labelling. Organic certification provides some assurance to <lb/>retailers and manufacturers that an organic claim complies with the provisions of the Fair <lb/>Trading Act. In Australia, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, <lb/>organic claims must be properly made and businesses that make organic claims must be able to <lb/>substantiate those claims. <lb/></body>

			<body>certifiers. Public control bodies are used in Denmark, Estonia and Finland, while both systems <lb/>co-exist in Korea, Japan, Poland, Spain and the United States. In addition, Norway and the <lb/>Netherlands have a system whereby a private certifier has a monopoly on certification, with a <lb/>formal agreement in place. Mexico traditionally relied on a participatory guarantee system, <lb/>whereby organic farmers are subject to the monitoring and review among peers, involving <lb/>organic consumers and technical consultants in regional networks; at the moment a process is <lb/>underway to recognise private certifiers. <lb/>Benefits and disadvantages of private relative to public certification <lb/>Among the mentioned benefits of using private certifiers is the choice offered to organic <lb/>producers. Competition between certifiers can promote better value for organic producers. It <lb/>forces certifiers to make their work as effective as possible. <lb/>Moreover, private certifiers&apos; personnel are dedicated organic specialists whose function is <lb/>to ensure conformity with organic farming and production standards. They have the expertise <lb/>to certify to organic standards. Private certifiers are more specialised than public control <lb/>bodies, which have to cover a wider range of standards. They can assure a higher efficiency <lb/>compared to public structures. For operators they provide fast inspection and certification <lb/>procedures and objectivity and less complicated administration than in governmental <lb/>administration. <lb/>Private certifiers often work in close collaboration with organic operators, enabling <lb/>trusted and long-standing relationships to develop. <lb/>Regarding conformity assessment, the private certifier can check conformity concerning <lb/>other international trademarks and standards as well (See cases of the Netherlands and <lb/>Switzerland in Annex 4). As private certifiers often propose their own private standards, the <lb/>system allows for the coexistence of national regulations and private standards; the first <lb/>providing a minimum standard and the latter providing the opportunity for market <lb/>diversification of organic products. <lb/>Having private certifiers carry out conformity assessment allows for a &quot; user-pays &quot; <lb/>approach to organic certification. The financial burden on governments is lower than when <lb/>undertaking an inspection role. Some countries interviewed pointed to a lack of human <lb/>resources and budget to maintain a public control body, so that certification has to be <lb/>outsourced. <lb/>In turn, according to the answers from several OECD member countries, the inspectors <lb/>from public bodies are regarded as independent and impartial by organic producers. <lb/>Certification fees of public bodies are generally lower than those of private certifiers. The <lb/>implementation of the standards is similar for all producers. With a government-managed <lb/>system, the credibility of organic claims to consumer is high. <lb/>In countries where private and public bodies are coexisting, certification fees of private <lb/>certifiers are generally higher than that of public agencies. Some countries stated that organic <lb/>certification is expensive and certification costs are passed on to consumers, making organic <lb/>products less accessible to a wider part of the population. Moreover, high fees make it more <lb/>difficult to attract new organic producers in the system. In addition, certifiers may promote <lb/>their own private standard rather than simply offering the official certification scheme. <lb/>10. <lb/>In Australia, for compliance with the National Standard for Organic and Bio-Dynamic Produce <lb/>(Export Control Orders 2005), in New Zealand for compliance with the Official Organic <lb/>Assurance Programme (OOAP) for exports. <lb/></body>

			<body>With private certifiers, it is difficult to ensure consistent delivery in conformity <lb/>assessment. It is not always possible to have agreed best-practice, as due to commercial <lb/>interests they are not always keen to agree to a standardised approach. Private control bodies <lb/>may have their own procedures that make it harder for producers to change the body swiftly. <lb/>When the number of certifiers becomes high, this results in major difficulties in supervision <lb/>for the Competent Authority responsible for the implementation of organic regulations. <lb/>As there is an economic pressure on private certifiers, competition can lead to dumping. If <lb/>no unified system of controls and sanctions is in place, there is a greater chance for fraud and <lb/>false certificates. In case a violation of standards is detected by a private certifier, operators <lb/>could put pressure on the private certifier threatening to move to a competitor. <lb/>In some countries, consumers of organic food have less confidence in the inspection by <lb/>private bodies. Private certifiers may have less credibility internationally than government <lb/>authorities. Gaining market access to other countries may then be more difficult for private <lb/>certifiers. <lb/>With a delegation of conformity assessment to the private sector, there is a potential loss <lb/>of control in the enforcement of regulations. However, the Competent Authority is <lb/>responsible for overseeing the operation and thus providing a guarantee to consumers. It is <lb/>also in charge of coordinating the control bodies to avoid disparities in procedures and <lb/>sanctions. <lb/>Policy interactions with voluntary standards <lb/>There are a number of problems which may arise if standard-setting and certification are <lb/>left to private organisations. These in turn create scope for government policies to improve <lb/>upon the market outcome. <lb/>A first problem is the credibility of the private initiative, both in terms of the credibility of <lb/>the standard and of the certification procedures. A second problem with relying solely on <lb/>private initiatives is the risk of ending up with no standard at all, or by contrast with a wide <lb/>variety of incompatible standards leading to high transaction costs for market participants. <lb/>These shortcomings suggest a role for public initiatives. In particular, governments can <lb/>increase the credibility of private standards and labels; increase the credibility of third-party <lb/>certification; stimulate the creation of private standards; and foster market integration by <lb/>harmonising existing standards. <lb/>Increasing the credibility of private labels and standards <lb/>A first issue with private standards and labels is that such schemes will only be as credible <lb/>as the body setting the standard. A supplier may rely on a third-party organisation for <lb/>standard-setting but without oversight, there is no guarantee that this organisation will keep its <lb/>integrity. NGOs play an important role as &quot; gate-keeper &quot; , in the development, the rating and <lb/>the benchmarking of private standards. <lb/>As neutral third-parties, governments may play a similar role in providing credibility to <lb/>voluntary standards. Their involvement includes encouraging transparency in standard setting, <lb/>ensuring that the process is fair and inclusive, and representing the voice of citizens within <lb/>standardising committees (UNFSS, 2013). Governmental experts and scientists provide <lb/>guidance to build scientifically sound criteria in working groups. <lb/>Public investments in data and research can also play a role in supporting the <lb/>development and verification of private environmental standards. Improved scientific <lb/>knowledge on agricultural sustainability, science-based environmental indicators, data on the <lb/>state of agriculture and the environment, and the dissemination of such information, can help <lb/>20 – VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>promote improvements in agricultural sustainability, provide a basis for valid market <lb/>differentiation and serve as a check on private claims of environmental stewardship <lb/>Another way by which governments may give credibility to industry initiatives is through <lb/>the official approval of private standards and certifications, with a governmental seal, by <lb/>reference to the private standards in public procurement guidelines, or with communication <lb/>campaigns to increase consumer awareness. Finally, the development of a public voluntary <lb/>standard (as often in the case of organic agriculture) can be analysed as a borderline case, <lb/>were national authorities are taking full responsibility for standard development and the <lb/>management of related information scheme, in order to grant the highest credibility to the <lb/>industry initiative. <lb/>Generally, interactions with private standards in OECD countries seem to be limited. <lb/>Only seven countries report to be involved to some extent: Australia, Germany, Hungary, <lb/>Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland. Government officials may be invited to <lb/>comment on standard drafts and to provide guidance through round-table discussions or <lb/>similar meetings. They may also act as experts in standard-setting committees. In Hungary, <lb/>private organic standards have to be approved by the authorities. The main motivations for <lb/>interacting with private bodies are to make sure standard-setting is transparent, fair and <lb/>inclusive, and compatible with governmental objectives. Conversely, no OECD government is <lb/>funding the activity of private organic standardising bodies. <lb/>In Australia, the Australian Government is represented on the committee overseeing the <lb/>Australian Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Products (AS6000-2009) developed under <lb/>the auspices of Standards Australia, the main standardising body in the country. This standard <lb/>is available for use by private certifiers. 11 <lb/>In 2003 Standards New Zealand published a standard for organic production (NZS8410-<lb/>2003). The standard was developed in consultation with staff from NZFSA (New Zealand <lb/>Food Safety Authority), and from 23 other organisations with an interest in organics. The <lb/>standard sets out minimum requirements for the production, handling, processing and <lb/>labelling of organic products including plant and plant products, and animal and animal <lb/>products. This standard is used by a number of organisations as a reference document, <lb/>including the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and the Commerce Commission. <lb/>Increasing the credibility of third-party certification <lb/>An important question regarding third-party certification is the reliability of the certifier. <lb/>Without external control by accreditation bodies and standard owners, the reliability of third-<lb/>party certification may be doubted, as consumers are unable to verify the integrity of the <lb/>certifier or the thoroughness with which the certifier screens producers. <lb/>From the point of view of the certifier, four factors determine the optimal amount of <lb/>inspection to be carried out (Jahn et al., 2005). Increasing the quality of inspections would <lb/>lead to greater direct costs (e.g. due to higher labour costs), together with a higher opportunity <lb/>cost of losing the producer as a client. On the other hand, reducing the quality of inspections <lb/>would increase the risk of a loss of reputation for the certifier, or of costs due to liability. This <lb/>suggests four ways of improving or guaranteeing the quality of third-party certification (Jahn <lb/>et al., 2005). <lb/>First, alternative ways of organising inspections might reduce the direct costs of offering a <lb/>good quality of inspection. One way of reducing costs is to move towards a risk-based <lb/>inspection system. As shown by Gambelli et al. (2014), the risk of violating the requirements <lb/>of organic farming can be predicted by previous non-compliance, as well as by farm size and <lb/>11. <lb/>It is a different standard than the National Standard for Organic and Bio-Dynamic Produce used <lb/>to certify production for export markets. <lb/>VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 21 <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>complexity of operations. However, the data currently recorded by control bodies are <lb/>insufficient to implement an effective risk-based approach. <lb/>Second, the risk of losing the producer as a client could be reduced in several ways. One <lb/>approach is to grant a monopoly to a single certification body, removing the possibility for <lb/>producers to engage in &quot; opinion shopping &quot; to select the most lenient certifier (Lennox, 2000). <lb/>Another solution is to prohibit certifiers to take on clients representing a large share of their <lb/>revenues, to prevent the certifier from becoming too dependent upon a large client (who could <lb/>subsequently exert pressure). Other solutions are a forced rotation of certifiers or forced long-<lb/>term contracts. <lb/>Third, increasing the potential reputation loss for certifiers would also improve the quality <lb/>of third-party certification. As Jahn et al. (2005) note, at present buyers have only limited <lb/>information about the performance of certifiers. One solution might be to publish rankings <lb/>based on detected fraud by different certifiers. <lb/>Fourth, increasing liability costs for the certifier in case of fraud would provide another <lb/>way to guarantee the quality of third-party certification. Jahn et al. (2005) note that this can <lb/>happen by increasing the probability of fraud detection, increasing the probability of liability, <lb/>and increasing the costs or fines in case of liability. <lb/>In the countries where private certifiers are officially recognised as control bodies for <lb/>public organic standards, a system has been implemented for the surveillance of their <lb/>operations. The degree of comprehensiveness of this oversight varies from one country to <lb/>another. <lb/>In the European Union, according to Council Regulation (EC) 834/2007 it is mandatory <lb/>for the Competent Authorities to develop a programme of surveillance to supervise and <lb/>monitor control bodies, with office audits of control bodies and witness audits of certified <lb/>organic operators. Control bodies are submitted to a double control, from the Competent <lb/>Authority (audit once a year) and from the accreditation body (audit every 15 months). The <lb/>surveillance of control bodies is also mandatory for countries that have bilateral agreements <lb/>with the EU (Sanders, 2014). <lb/>The authorities responsible for overseeing control bodies are generally the same as the <lb/>Competent Authority. Before being recognised by the authority, and regardless of whether <lb/>they provide conformity assessment to country-regulated organic standards only, or to other <lb/>agricultural standards as well, private certifiers have to show that they are competent and <lb/>reliable when they operate product certification. This is usually done through a formal <lb/>accreditation according to ISO/IEC Guide 65 (General requirements for bodies operating <lb/>product certification systems), EN 45011 (General Criteria for Certification Bodies Operating <lb/>Product Certification Systems) or equivalent. <lb/>Stimulating the creation of private standards <lb/>If the process of defining and implementing a standard is costly and complicated for <lb/>private operators, it may not get undertaken at all. There is thus a problem of &quot; collective <lb/>action &quot; in standard setting. While business operators share collective goals, they may disagree <lb/>on the way to proceed. There may be conflicting views on best practices, key criteria and <lb/>performance thresholds, which result in a lack of consensus and persistence of the status quo. <lb/>Moreover, even if they collectively benefit from a standard, businesses have little incentive <lb/>individually and face transaction costs in engaging in standard development. <lb/>A government may therefore act as an enabling institution that provides institutional <lb/>infrastructure and guidance, exerting pressure to push negotiations to reach solutions. It may <lb/>also act as an &quot; enforcing institution &quot; with the threat to develop a public standard, embedded in <lb/>law, to overcome the status quo. In doing so, governments influence the agenda of standard <lb/>setters (Ponte, 2014). <lb/></body>

			<body>At least with regard to organic standards, such initiatives seem to be limited. In the survey <lb/>on organic regulations and policies, no examples of governments supporting private standard <lb/>setters in this way were identified. <lb/>Fostering market integration by harmonising standards <lb/>When relying solely on private actors to develop standards, the opposite problem may <lb/>also arise: a wide variety of different standards and labels may emerge in the market. While in <lb/>theory competition between standards could lead to the emergence of a limited number of <lb/>dominant labels in the market, this process might take time. The co-existence of similarly-<lb/>sounding standards can lead to confusion among buyers and to higher transaction costs for <lb/>suppliers who have to deal with a variety of requirements. Moreover, if different countries <lb/>implement different standards, this may hamper trade. <lb/>To avoid confusion among buyers, to reduce transaction costs for suppliers, and to <lb/>facilitate trade, the government may wish to reduce these transaction costs by harmonising the <lb/>standards used in the market. One way to do this is for the government to set its own standard. <lb/>However, there are several other possibilities. For instance, the government could select one <lb/>existing private standard as the official standard, subsidise or otherwise stimulate one private <lb/>standard but not others, or strongly encourage the harmonisation of private standards. <lb/>Standard harmonisation alleviates barriers to trade and facilitates market access for <lb/>producers. In the United States, in 1990, the US Congress passed the Organic Food Protection <lb/>Act to facilitate interstate commerce in organically produced food. The USDA National <lb/>Organic Program (NOP) standards published in 2002 had an explicit goal of removing <lb/>variation amongst different organic certifications and State laws on organic labelling <lb/>(Schewe, 2011). In the European Union, Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 has been <lb/>implemented to harmonise existing national standards and facilitate market integration. The <lb/>revision of the EU regulation in 2005-2007 aimed at strengthening the common framework, <lb/>after a proliferation of derogations and divergent Member States&apos; interpretation of rules <lb/>(Gibbon, 2008). In the United States and the EU, harmonisation has been achieved through a <lb/>public standard. In Switzerland, the Federal government pushed local organic associations to <lb/>create a common private standard in the early 1980s, Bio Suisse, to improve market <lb/>transparency, increase the integrity of value chains, and protect Swiss consumers. A national <lb/>legislation has been introduced much later in 1997 (Annex 4). <lb/>For several countries, market issues have been the main spur of regulations. A better <lb/>integration of the domestic market and better access to foreign markets were cited by 9 out of <lb/>14 countries (taking the EU as a single country) as a motivation for developing organic <lb/>regulation, making it the second most important reason (after consumer protection). In Iceland <lb/>and Switzerland, organic regulations have been strongly motivated by the prospects of trade <lb/>integration with the European Union (i.e. AEEA Agreement, EU-Switzerland bilateral <lb/>agreement). <lb/>Potential drawbacks to government intervention <lb/>Multiple coexisting standards may not necessarily be a sign of market dysfunction. <lb/>Instead, they may indicate a competitive market situation providing larger consumer choice. <lb/>In turn, government intervention to harmonize standards could hence result in reduced <lb/>consumer choice and a reduction in consumer welfare. The introduction of a governmental <lb/>standard next to existing private standards could erode the value of private investments in <lb/>market development, including investments by NGOs in setting and verifying standards. <lb/>Public standards may reduce private-sector incentives to invest in environmental <lb/>differentiation. In addition, adjusting governmental standards to changing consumer <lb/>preferences may be more difficult than amending private ones. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. <lb/>Using standards to achieve policy objectives <lb/>As documented in the previous chapter, standards can be used to make markets work <lb/>better by solving information problems. In this chapter, the focus is on how standards can be <lb/>used to implement policy objectives other than those related to improving the functioning of <lb/>food markets. In particular, the goal of this chapter is to identify potential synergies between <lb/>public policies and voluntary standards, including their related certification system. <lb/>An example of synergy is when a governmental programme can be made more effective <lb/>by referring to existing voluntary standards, rather than developing a series of technical <lb/>criteria from scratch, or by relying on existing certification systems and private certifiers, <lb/>rather than creating a control authority. Another example of synergy is the use of private <lb/>certifiers to adapt on-site inspections in governmental checks, reducing simultaneously <lb/>administrative costs and farmer transaction costs. <lb/>The next section introduces different approaches to achieve policy objectives, and offers a <lb/>first discussion of possible interactions with voluntary standards. Subsequently, an overview <lb/>is given of the different stages of the policy process. Based on this overview, possibilities for <lb/>synergies are explored in regulatory design, policy implementation and monitoring of <lb/>compliance. <lb/>Throughout, reference is made to existing literature, to the survey on organic agriculture <lb/>standards in the OECD (Annex 3) and to eight case studies undertaken in four countries: <lb/>France, Korea, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The full cases are available as country <lb/>chapters in Annex 4. <lb/>Options for public intervention <lb/>To achieve policy objectives such as environmental policy goals, governments can use a <lb/>variety of approaches. These can be classified by the degree of government intervention they <lb/>imply (Figure 1), ranging from no intervention to a command and control approach. For each <lb/>of these steps, possible interactions with voluntary standards can be identified. <lb/>Self-regulation <lb/>Governments can choose to rely on self-regulation such as voluntary industry codes of <lb/>practice. In the context of environmental objectives in agriculture, relevant examples include <lb/>farm assurance schemes and private quality assurance schemes developed by retailers. <lb/>Voluntary environmental standards can thus be part of &quot; self-regulation &quot; , the assumption being <lb/>here that they are contributing to the achievement of policy goals, without any intervention <lb/>from government (Sinclair, 1997; Gunningham and Rees, 1997). <lb/>Co-regulation <lb/>An alternative approach is co-regulation. The term is used to describe public and private <lb/>sectors working together to achieve policy objectives at lower cost (Eijlander, 2005). Co-<lb/>regulation is a &quot; hybrid &quot; policy instrument, in the sense that the overseeing of the process is <lb/>retained by government, while it allows considerable input from the industry in order to tailor <lb/>regulatory responses (Sinclair, 1997). Initially focused on regulatory design, the concept has <lb/>been subsequently extended to the entire policy process, up to conformity assessment and <lb/>compliance enforcement (Garcia-Martinez et al, 2013). Considerable emphasis has been put <lb/>on the endorsement of voluntary standards and codes of practice by public agencies. <lb/>In its white paper on governance, the European Commission promotes a greater use of co-<lb/>regulation. According to the Commission, &quot; Co-regulation combines binding legislative and <lb/></body>

			<body>regulatory action with actions taken by the actors most concerned, drawing on their practical <lb/>expertise. The result is wider ownership of the policies in question by involving those most <lb/>affected by implementing rules in their preparation and enforcement. This often achieves <lb/>better compliance, even where the detailed rules are non-binding &quot; (OJ, 2001). The white <lb/>paper further provides conditions for a co-regulatory approach, in particular that co-regulation <lb/>should serve the general interest, and that the participating organisations should be <lb/> &quot; representative &quot; , &quot; accountable &quot; and capable of following open procedures in formulating and <lb/>applying the agreed rules (OJ, 2001). <lb/>One area where co-regulation is becoming increasingly important is food safety. Several <lb/>national authorities have moved from traditional command and control towards a more <lb/>flexible approach, where private firms are developing their own &quot; internal rules and procedures <lb/>in order to fulfil the regulator&apos;s policy objectives &quot; (Garcia Martinez et al., 2007). In the <lb/>United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and several state <lb/>environmental agencies, such as that of Massachusetts, have also introduced management-<lb/>based regulations: rather than mandating specific process requirements, the agencies are <lb/>expecting the regulated firms &quot; to produce plans that comply with general criteria designed to <lb/>promote the targeted social goal &quot; (Coglianese and Lazer, 2003). <lb/>The OECD report on Regulatory Policies in OECD Countries, From Interventionism to <lb/>Regulatory Governance (2002) provides an overview of benefits and drawbacks of co-<lb/>regulation. Potential benefits include greater levels of compliance, greater responsiveness and <lb/>lower overhead thanks to the involvement of the industry and interested parties. Possible <lb/>drawbacks are a higher risk of regulatory capture 12 , potentially anti-competitive activities and <lb/>the development of barriers to entry for outsiders (OECD, 2002). <lb/>Information and education <lb/>To achieve policy goals, policymakers may also use information and education. In the <lb/>context of environmental objectives, for instance, governments can use public education as <lb/>well as information and promotion campaigns in order to raise consumer awareness and <lb/>stimulate the demand for products with desirable environmental attributes. Other options <lb/>include collecting and publishing evidence to guide the public debate or a &quot; naming and <lb/>shaming &quot; approach to exert pressure to adopt best practices. Technical assistance and <lb/>extension services may also be included under this category. Voluntary standards can be used <lb/>in this approach by the endorsement of private labelling initiatives (e.g. for organic food). <lb/>Incentive-based structures <lb/>The fifth category of policy options are incentive-based structures. This includes using <lb/>rewards or taxes to stimulate desirable behaviour, as well as the use of market-based tools. <lb/>Examples of agri-environmental policies in this category include payments for land <lb/>retirement or for the adoption of environmentally-friendly practices. These can be a flat rate <lb/>payment per hectare of eligible land (e.g. agri-environment programs in the European Union, <lb/>Norway and Switzerland) or delivered through auctions (e.g. Conservation Reserve Program <lb/>in the United States, BushTender programme in Australia). Environmental taxes or charges <lb/>include e.g. input taxes levied on pesticides in Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden, <lb/>and the taxes on fertiliser applied in Italy, Sweden and some states of the United States. <lb/>Market-based tools include permit trading for carbon emissions, water quality (United States), <lb/>nutrients (Australia, Canada) and surplus phosphates from manure (The Netherlands) (OECD, <lb/>2010). <lb/>12. <lb/>A form of government failure, where vested interests from the private sector dominate over the <lb/>initial (societal) objectives of the regulatory agency. <lb/></body>

			<body>According to the Inventory of policies addressing environmental issues in agriculture <lb/>(Vojtech, 2010), payments to farmers also include grants to cover investment in <lb/>environmentally-friendly facilities and equipment, such as the Environmental Quality <lb/>Incentives Program (EQIP) grants in the United States, the structural payment programmes <lb/>under Rural Development Regulation (RDP) in the EU, and several tax concession programs <lb/>in Japan, Australia and Canada. <lb/>Voluntary standards can play an important role in such incentive-based policies. In <lb/>particular, agri-environmental programs are generally compensating farmers for the adoption <lb/>of input-reducing practices (e.g. crop rotations, reduced fertiliser and pesticides application), <lb/>landscape and habitat measures, identified as being beneficial to the environment (Uthes and <lb/>Matzdorf, 2013). The list of eligible practices is developed by governments, and controls are <lb/>based on compliance with the specifications. But those area payments may also be based on <lb/>compliance with existing certification schemes, which is the case for organic agriculture in <lb/>several OECD member countries. <lb/>More broadly, there are opportunities for equivalence between government-designed <lb/>measures and existing certification schemes. In the European Union, under the new Common <lb/>Agricultural Policy, a &quot; green payment &quot; will represent 30% of the budget for direct payments <lb/>and be allocated to farmers on an annual basis, provided that they fulfil three <lb/>environmentally-friendly practices (crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent <lb/>grassland, minimal proportion of ecological focus area). National and regional certification <lb/>schemes may be recognised as equivalent with greening if their requirements cover or exceed <lb/>the practices listed in the regulation (EC, 2013). <lb/>Command and control <lb/>Finally, governments can rely on direct command and control intervention. These include <lb/>the tools traditionally associated with government policy, such as direct regulation, public <lb/>enforcement and monitoring, and sanctions and penalties. Environmental regulations, for <lb/>instance, can be applied to the quality or quantity of marketed products (product regulations), <lb/>technologies or processes (process regulations), or environmental performance (performance <lb/>regulations) (OECD, 2010). However, also in this case governments can rely on existing <lb/>standards to set the regulations. <lb/>Figure 1. Options for public intervention <lb/>Source: Garcia-Martinez et al.

			<body>The policy process <lb/>To allow a better understanding of the possible interactions between policies and <lb/>voluntary standards, this section discusses the different stages of the policy process, as shown <lb/>in Figure 2. The subsequent section then discusses at what stage in the policy process <lb/>synergies with voluntary standards are possible and highlights experiences from the eight case <lb/>studies conducted. <lb/>Strategizing <lb/>The policy process starts from strategizing. This stage includes the identification of policy <lb/>issues, a definition of what the government wants to achieve, the evaluation of past policies, <lb/>the setting of targets, and the establishment of the operational features of the policy set, taking <lb/>into account the potential negative side-effects (Van Tongeren, 2008).This step includes <lb/>deciding among the options identified in the previous section, e.g. whether to rely on self-<lb/>regulation, co-regulation, command and control, and so on. In environmental policy, a policy <lb/>mix may include statutory rules and other direct command and control intervention, as well as <lb/>economic incentives such as tax and subsidies, tradable permits, and communicative <lb/>instruments. <lb/>Organisational design <lb/>Before implementing policies, a decision is made on the organisational form. Ideally this <lb/>stage includes a clear allocation of responsibilities within the executive branch of government, <lb/>the choice of the appropriate level of centralisation and decentralisation, a flow chart of the <lb/>different administrative sections and units, long-term planning and budgeting, indicators to <lb/>track the effective implementation of policies, and a mechanism to coordinate the action of <lb/>the bodies in charge of the policy. In some cases, it may be necessary to create a new office or <lb/>to restructure existing agencies. <lb/>Regulatory design <lb/>Regardless of whether the core policy tool is a command and control intervention or not, <lb/>regulatory design is part of the process. A solid regulatory base is required before the <lb/>implementation of any policy instrument. This includes market-based approaches such as <lb/>tradable permits, which need government regulation to create the institutional framework and <lb/>allocate initial property rights (Van Tongeren, 2008). Drafting or renewing legislation, <lb/>enacting ministerial decrees, and updating the provisions of administrative law are part of this <lb/>stage. The Regulatory Authority responsible for preparing the regulations is usually a branch <lb/>of central or local government. <lb/>Policy implementation <lb/>Policies are then implemented by different public bodies under the oversight of one <lb/>competent Authority (in the simplest case) which may be a ministerial department, an <lb/>independent agency, or a local government responsible for policy implementation within its <lb/>constituency. This stage includes the implementation of an information system, financial <lb/>circuits and control procedures to check eligibility and compliance; the negotiation of public <lb/>service delegations and agreements; the identification of beneficiaries, the processing of <lb/>applications, the provision of payments and the collection of taxes and fees (OECD, 2007). <lb/>Communication and technical assistance are provided. <lb/></body>

			<body>Monitoring <lb/>The monitoring step is composed of several ex-post checks for compliance by the Control <lb/>Authority (e.g. verification of documents, on-site inspection, product testing), as well as the <lb/>provision of discharge and clearing to regulated operators and programme participants. <lb/>Enforcement <lb/>Finally, the measures are enforced through administrative sanctions provided by the <lb/>Control Authority and the Competent Authority (e.g., reductions in payment, fines, <lb/>suspension of licence, plant closure) and eventually through legal sanctions in courts. <lb/>Figure 2. Sequences and main actors in the policy process <lb/>Interactions in the policy process <lb/>Interactions with voluntary standards will be concentrated mostly in three steps of the <lb/>policy process: regulatory design, policy implementation, and monitoring. <lb/>Strategizing and organisational design are considered as a prerogative of governments. It <lb/>should however be noted that the identification of needs and the choice of policy options <lb/>involves the consultation of concerned citizens and stakeholder groups (Van Tongeren, 2008). <lb/>Likewise, the enforcement of regulations is ultimately the responsibility of the executive <lb/>and judiciary branches of government. Even when command and control is replaced by more <lb/>flexible voluntary industry schemes, there is still an overseeing of schemes by public control <lb/>authorities, to check that they fulfil the regulatory objectives (Bonnaud and Coppalle, 2013). <lb/>In case of disputes with the administration, legal recourses are available. However, there are <lb/>some cases when policy enforcement may be backed by standards. In developing countries <lb/>lacking the resources to properly enforce their own regulations, voluntary standards may <lb/>implicitly increase compliance with national law and regulations, as this is a prerequisite for <lb/>certification (Djama, 2011). In most cases, however, the role of voluntary standards in this <lb/>step of the policy process will be limited. <lb/>• Formulation of policy objectives <lb/> • Choice of policy set (e.g. statutory, incentives)<lb/>Strategizing <lb/>• Allocation of responsibilities within the <lb/>executive branch of government<lb/>Organisational design <lb/>• Drafting, reviewing and publishing legislation <lb/> and ministerial orders<lb/>Regulatory design <lb/>• Implementation of measures and checks <lb/> • Communication and guidance to operators<lb/>Policy <lb/>implementation <lb/>• Policy checks (e.g. inspection, testing) <lb/> • Discharge, clearance<lb/>Monitoring <lb/>• Administrative and legal sanctions <lb/> • Appeal procedures<lb/>Enforcement <lb/>28 – VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>Regulatory design <lb/>The drafting of legislation is obviously a prerogative of governments. However, <lb/>governments may choose to &quot; outsource &quot; part of their regulatory prerogatives (Djama, 2011). <lb/>For example, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), responsible for food safety and food hygiene <lb/>in the United Kingdom, has stimulated the generation of voluntary codes of good practice by <lb/>the profession, in particular the Assured Food Standards (AFS) launched by the National <lb/>Farmers&apos; Union. In Canada, comparable farm assurance standards have been actively <lb/>promoted by provincial governments, for example in Ontario (Garcia-Martinez et al, 2007). <lb/>Conversely, government regulations and administrative law may incorporate private <lb/>standards or be influenced by those standards, as demonstrated by the case of Korea <lb/>Certified Organic in Korea. <lb/>In 1993, the Korean Government decided to regulate organic labelling and advertisement <lb/>to protect consumers with the Agricultural Products Quality Control Act. At the same time, it <lb/>was decided to develop a regulated organic standard, setting out the minimum requirements to <lb/>be met by organic products, assisting farmers in the appropriate adoption of organic practices. <lb/>From 1996, the certification system additionally covered low-pesticide agricultural products, <lb/>and a labelling system for organic products, Korea Certified Organic, was introduced in the <lb/>same year. The organic regulation of Korea covers all the requirements for organic <lb/>agricultural products, feed and processed food, including production rules, processing, <lb/>labelling, control, inspection, certification and assessment of imported feed and foodstuff. <lb/>Unlike the experience of European countries, Korea did not have competent private actors <lb/>leading the establishment of environmental standards. As a result, the Korean Government <lb/>thus played a key role from the beginning. <lb/>The case of Korea Certified Organic shows synergies in regulatory design between public <lb/>regulation and private standards. The Korean public regulation on organic agricultural <lb/>products is largely based on organic standards developed in other countries and by <lb/>international organisations, in particular the IFOAM standards published by the International <lb/>Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, a non-governmental organisation 13 . Moreover, <lb/>rules on production, labelling and marketing of organic products are based on the guidelines <lb/>of Codex Alimentarius, of which Korea is a member. <lb/>Referring to existing standards allows for significant cost savings in the development of <lb/>domestic regulations. Other countries&apos; experiences from the development and operation of <lb/>regulations and standards can be built upon, which should reduce problems potentially arising <lb/>from inconsistencies in the regulations and with related institutions. In addition, the clear link <lb/>to existing standards helps to reduce potential trade frictions that arise from differences in <lb/>national regulations and the need for compliance with different requirements. Finally, the <lb/>introduction of a legal basis for the equivalency with foreign organic food regulations driven <lb/>by the linkage to international standards is likely to facilitate trade in organic food products. <lb/>In the case of the Korea Certified Organic, elements of the IFOAM standard have been <lb/>incorporated into national regulations in the mid-1990s. Since then, Korea&apos;s organic <lb/>regulations have been amended several times under the authority of the Ministry of <lb/>Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, last time in 2014 in the context of the Act on <lb/>Environment-friendly Agriculture and Fisheries and Organic Food Management Support. The <lb/>content of regulations has therefore evolved independently from the IFOAM standard. <lb/>13. <lb/>The IFOAM standards have also been influential in the development of other organic regulations <lb/>in other countries, as well as of private standards. <lb/></body>

			<body>A different approach of using standards in regulatory design would be to make explicit <lb/>reference to a standard in the regulation, as a requirement for compliance. The costs of <lb/>regulatory design are minimised. In that case however, several drawbacks and risks should be <lb/>mentioned. There is no participation of government in the governance of standard setting, or <lb/>governmental overseeing of the standard content. If the private operators unilaterally decide to <lb/>change the elements of the private standard, they de facto impact the scope and stringency of <lb/>regulations. <lb/>While the case of Korea Certified Organic shows how private standards (in this case the <lb/>IFOAM organic standards) can be used as building blocks for public standards, the reverse <lb/>situation is also possible, i.e. where public standards serve as the basis for developing private <lb/>standards. This is illustrated by the case of SwissGAP standards in Switzerland (Box 1). <lb/>Box 1. SwissGAP: Public standards as building blocks for private standards <lb/>In the case of the SwissGAP standard in Switzerland, the requirements of a private standard are based on <lb/>criteria first set in a governmental programme. <lb/>Switzerland imports a substantial share of its domestic consumption of fruits and vegetables. Around the year <lb/>2000, sporadic problems with pesticide residues occurred on the European food markets, and Swiss retailers <lb/>wanted to protect themselves against any potential incident that could damage their reputation. In order to <lb/>guarantee safety to their consumers, retailers therefore requested third-party certifications from their foreign <lb/>suppliers, such as the EurepGAP standard developed in 1997 by North European retailers (renamed GLOBALGAP <lb/>in 2007). To provide the same quality assurance in local sourcing, retailers (in particular the market leaders COOP <lb/>and Migros) requested their Swiss suppliers to comply with EurepGAP or other equivalent third-party certification of <lb/>good agricultural practices. Swiss retailers and national producer associations engaged in a dialogue around <lb/>standardisation and the best ways for developing the required farm assurance schemes. <lb/>The resulting SwissGAP standard for the production of fruits, vegetables and potatoes, introduced in 2006, <lb/>builds simultaneously on the requirements of GLOBALGAP standards and on the Proof of Ecological Performance <lb/>(PEP), a set of environmentally-friendly practices developed by the Federal government as part of the Swiss <lb/>agricultural policy reform. In Switzerland, PEP are not part of mandatory environmental regulations but the <lb/>fulfilment of PEP is required to receive direct payments since 1999. Therefore, at the time of the development of <lb/>the SwissGAP standard, with PEP, the &quot; baseline &quot; level was set rather high in Switzerland, especially in comparison <lb/>with the checklist of GLOBALGAP standard, which is more focussed on hygiene and risk management than on <lb/>environment conservation, and which was developed by retailers to be suitable to all sourcing countries. SwissGAP <lb/>thus goes further than GLOBALGAP in terms of environmental requirements. Rather than developing these <lb/>environmental requirements from scratch, the professional bodies involved with SwissGAP built the normative base <lb/>on the PEP. <lb/>Policy implementation <lb/>As discussed earlier, the level of governmental intervention may range from &quot; doing <lb/>nothing &quot; to command and control approaches based on mandatory rules and sanctions, with <lb/> &quot; co-regulation &quot; lying in between. The latter includes the use of voluntary standards and codes <lb/>of practice. Likewise, the use of standards in the implementation of policies may be more or <lb/>less active, from only supporting standard-setting organisations (i.e. funding, guidance) to <lb/>making standards mandatory. Four of the case studies illustrate the continuum of government <lb/>intervention (Figure 3). <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 3. Continuum in the use of standards in cases <lb/>Endorsement of standards <lb/>A first way in which governments can rely on voluntary standards to implement policies <lb/>is by endorsing existing standards. <lb/>In the case of the Farm Environmental Certification in France, the government has <lb/>developed a common framework to level the playing field in environmental standards, with a <lb/>mechanism to officially recognise existing private standards. After a first wave of organic and <lb/>biodynamic standards developed in the 1970s, a second generation of farm standards on <lb/>environmentally-friendly agriculture were introduced in France in the 1990s. Taking up <lb/>concerns on the environmental sustainability of agriculture, often together with questions <lb/>related to food safety and quality, those standards were developed by retailers, producer <lb/>cooperatives and professional bodies. <lb/>A national certification (Certification environnementale des exploitations agricoles) was <lb/>initiated by the French Government as part of a wider effort to promote sustainable <lb/>production and consumption, and to strengthen the environmental dimension of public <lb/>policies. Developed and sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture in close collaboration with <lb/>professional bodies and NGOs, it has been promulgated by decree in 2011. The creation of a <lb/>certification was driven by the objective to better communicate farmers&apos; efforts towards <lb/>sustainability, and simultaneously – for representatives of agri-food and retailing sector – to <lb/>address consumers&apos; demand for more environmentally-friendly food (Meybeck and Pingault, <lb/>2010). <lb/>The certification is organised around three progressive levels. Level one is the <lb/>introductory standard, with a farm self-assessment and the fulfilment of EU &quot; cross-<lb/>compliance &quot; (i.e. requirements to receive any direct payment within the Common Agricultural <lb/>Policy). Level two is an intermediary level that reflects compliance with a set of 16 different <lb/>criteria (e.g. biodiversity conservation, crop protection strategy, fertilisation, water <lb/>management) that have an effective impact on the environment and are designed to be <lb/>integrated into the farm&apos;s daily management. These criteria set goals for environmental <lb/>progress on the farm, provide guidelines for the rational use of inputs and limit accidental <lb/>leakage into habitats. Only the most stringent level (Level three) grants the label of &quot; High <lb/>Environmental Value &quot; to farmers compliant with the standard. <lb/></body>

			<body>An interesting feature of the certification is that previously existing environmental <lb/>standards operating in France can be benchmarked and recognised as equivalent to Level two. <lb/>Farmers may be directly certified under Level two or be automatically recognised as certified <lb/>if they are in an existing recognised scheme. To be recognised as equivalent, voluntary <lb/>standards have to cover the 16 criteria of the Farm Environmental Certification. Requests for <lb/>equivalence recognition are sent for approval to an independent committee. Any standard-<lb/>owner can apply. Some of the most prominent private environmental standards have already <lb/>been successfully benchmarked. Between 2012 and early 2014, 21 voluntary standards were <lb/>recognised as equivalent to the level two of the certification. <lb/>The motivations for the recognition of existing standards were i) to enhance the <lb/>environmental efforts already undertaken by farmers; ii) to improve transparency across <lb/>existing standards; and iii) to promote the wider application of the new scheme, by defining it <lb/>as complementing rather than competing with existing initiatives by the private sector <lb/>(Meybeck et al., 2010). <lb/>Moreover, compliance with recognised private standards is considered as a step towards <lb/>further improvement. In other words, rather than leaping to the &quot; High Environmental Value &quot; <lb/>(HVE) standard, farmers can take a more gradual approach, experimenting with the good <lb/>agricultural practices promoted by the private sector in their close professional environment to <lb/>first obtain Level two certification which can then serve as a starting point for further <lb/>improvements towards Level three. <lb/>In Canada, the Environmental Farm Plans scheme provides another example of standard <lb/>endorsement, the enrolment in this voluntary scheme being a condition to benefit from <lb/>various federal and provincial agri-environmental programmes. The Environmental Farm <lb/>Plans scheme began as a pilot project in seven counties across Ontario in 1993, under the <lb/>leadership of the Ontario Farm Environmental Coalition, with a strong &quot; bottom-up <lb/>dimension &quot; (Robinson, 2006). The approach has been successfully taken up in other Canadian <lb/>provinces. <lb/>The Environmental Farm Plan is similar to an environmental management system, <lb/>although with a greater emphasis on technical assistance and extension. Within this scheme, <lb/>the incumbent farmer attend several workshops with peers, complete a self-assessment of its <lb/>farm activities and develop an action plan, to mitigate environmental risks in 23 different <lb/>areas of farm management. Producers have the option to get their action plan peer-reviewed <lb/>by a local committee, comprised of local farmers experienced with farm environmental issues. <lb/>In several other provinces, a certificate is granted by advisors from extension services. In any <lb/>case, confidentiality of farm self-assessment and action plans is guaranteed. After the <lb/>validation of the Environmental Farm Plan action plan, the farmer is eligible to apply for cost-<lb/>share funding to implement Best Management Practices, under the Farm Stewardship <lb/>Programs financed by Canada and provincial governments. <lb/>In addition to being a prerequisite to access incentive programs, participation in the <lb/>Environmental Farm Plan may reduce the risk of legal liability for the violation of <lb/>environmental regulations, as it is generally considered as an indication of due diligence. <lb/>More broadly, as the action plans are also incorporating several legally-mandated practices <lb/>(e.g. nutrient management planning), they contribute to foster farmers compliance with law <lb/>(Rajsic et al., 2012) 14 . <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">14. <lb/>Existence of Environmental Farm Plans provide a strong basis for voluntary environmental <lb/>standard planning and development. McCain Foods uses the EFP as part of their Good <lb/>Agricultural Practices (GAP) program in Canada. The company views the EFP as a complete and <lb/>made-in-Canada solution for standards, and has made the EFP a requirement for all its potato <lb/>suppliers. EFP participation is also mandatory for farmers who wish to be a member of Local <lb/>32 – VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>The French Farm Environmental Certification and the Canadian Environmental Farm <lb/>Plan schemes provide different examples for public endorsement of private standards. The <lb/>case of the Farm Environmental Certification in France shows the potential of endorsing <lb/>existing standards as a way of developing a unified framework. In the context of a <lb/>proliferation of sustainability initiatives, the common framework allows pooling together <lb/>standards sharing common characteristics, to help level the playing field and raise the <lb/>credibility of private initiatives. According to officials responsible for the development of the <lb/>certification, the participatory approach for setting the public standard and the proper <lb/>screening of private standard applications by an independent body are key to the success of <lb/>the policy. The example of Environmental Farm Plans in Canada shows that voluntary <lb/>initiatives may be used in complementarity with incentive payments to foster the adoption of <lb/>BMPs. In both cases, governments have ensured that the voluntary initiatives were seriously <lb/>addressing agri-environmental challenges. <lb/>It should be noted that in other situations, when endorsing private standards over which <lb/>they have little control, governments run the risk of damage to their reputations if the standard <lb/>fails, either because claims are not verified or the standard is ultimately deemed to be of <lb/>questionable value. <lb/>Measures to increase supply or demand of certified production <lb/>The supply or demand of production certified according to voluntary standards can be <lb/>stimulated by governments. An example of this is the case of the IP-SUISSE standard for <lb/>integrated production in Switzerland, managed by the Swiss Farmers Association for <lb/>Integrated Production. Certified producers are eligible to governmental targeted payments. A <lb/>second example is the case of organic agriculture in France, which illustrates an active <lb/>approach to stimulate simultaneously the supply and demand for certified production, with an <lb/>Action Plan that includes EU co-funded payments for conversion and maintenance in organic <lb/>production. <lb/>The IP-SUISSE standard for integrated production and the related certification scheme <lb/>and label have been developed by the Swiss Farmers Association for Integrated Production <lb/>(Association Suisse des paysannes et paysans pratiquant la production intégrée, in abbreviate <lb/>form IP-SUISSE), a non-governmental professional organisation founded in 1989. Integrated <lb/>production is a &apos;holistic&apos; farm-scale approach with an emphasis on replacing polluting inputs <lb/>by natural resources and regulating mechanisms. In contrast to organic farming, integrated <lb/>production does not ban chemical inputs, but promotes a wise use of pesticides and fertilisers. <lb/>The Swiss Federal administration is not involved in the development and revision of IP-<lb/>SUISSE standards, which are discussed essentially between the association&apos;s delegates, their <lb/>technical and commercial partners. On the other hand, the strategy of the association and the <lb/>policy objectives of the Federal government to promote an environmentally friendly <lb/>agriculture (OECD, 2015) quite naturally converged over the last twenty years. <lb/>From 1993 to 1998, as part of the newly introduced system of direct payments, farmers <lb/>could get payments for integrated production. The criteria were related to biodiversity, soil <lb/>conservation, manure application, cultivation programme, cultivar selection, integrated pest <lb/>management, and the holding of livestock; at least 5% of the land had to be cultivated as <lb/>ecological compensation area (extensive meadows or floral fallow). A supplement was <lb/>granted if integrated production applied to the whole farm. In 1999, these payments for <lb/>integrated production were replaced by a new system. To receive any of the direct payments, <lb/>farmers needed to demonstrate environmental cross-compliance using the Proof of Ecological <lb/>Food Plus, a voluntary certification initiative that brings farmers and consumers together to <lb/>promote environmentally and socially responsible food production (Schmidt et al., 2013). <lb/>VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 33 <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/></note>

			<body>Performance (PEP), which was largely based on the previous requirements for integrated <lb/>production (OECD, 2015). <lb/>In addition, there is a link between the IP-SUISSE standard and two other policy <lb/>measures. First, payments for extensive cereal and rapeseed farming ( &quot; extenso &quot; payments) <lb/>have been introduced in 1990 as part of the ecological direct payments. The support has been <lb/>extended in more recent programmes, including the current policy package for 2014-2017, as <lb/>part of the payments for production systems, which also includes the support to organic <lb/>farming. To be certified under the IP-SUISSE standard, producers of cereals and rapeseed <lb/>must follow the requirements of &quot; extenso &quot; production. <lb/>Second, biodiversity quality payments are payments targeted to specific farming practices <lb/>or biodiversity outcomes (OECD, 2015). IP-SUISSE is applying a credit point system for <lb/>biodiversity which allows scope for action according to farmers&apos; preferences while the <lb/>Federal government provides payments targeted to defined biodiversity services. <lb/>The IP-SUISSE case highlights the complementarity between governmental programs and <lb/>private standards, mutually strengthening each other in a dynamic fashion over the years. <lb/>With more than 20 000 farmers currently enrolled, the IP-SUISSE scheme indirectly <lb/>contributes to the achievement of the governmental objectives to promote an environmentally <lb/>friendly agriculture. <lb/>Box 2. Support to certified organic agriculture in OECD countries <lb/>From the results of the questionnaire to country officials, it may be put forward a &quot; modal &quot; approach of <lb/>government involvement with organic agriculture in the OECD. <lb/>The central government is supporting the growth of the organic sector, through several policy measures, <lb/>which are generally put in coherence within a multi-year strategic plan. Among the 27 OECD countries that <lb/>support organic agriculture and food, the main motivation for policy is the environmental benefits associated <lb/>with organic agriculture. Response to consumer demand and the improvement in animal welfare are also <lb/>frequently quoted by governments. The positive impacts on employment and consumer health are driving <lb/>organic policies in about one-third of countries. <lb/>The policy mix includes support to organic farmers, organic food channels and the provision of general <lb/>services. Direct area payments to producers are widespread: 52% of countries are providing payments for <lb/>conversion to organic agriculture and 58% payments for maintenance. Regarding other types of direct <lb/>financial support, the coverage of certification costs is relatively frequent (36%), as well as investment grants <lb/>to individual farmers (24%). Measures for improving human capital include advice and technical training <lb/>(48% of countries), vocational training (24%), and integration of courses on organic farming in curricular <lb/>(21%). <lb/>OECD governments are also supporting organic food channels. This is more frequently done through <lb/>the support to organic fairs (39%) and for organic food marketing initiatives (33%). Public procurement is not <lb/>widespread (18%) and only found in Europe (Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Switzerland). <lb/>Regarding collective services for organic agriculture and food, more than half of countries are supporting <lb/>research projects on organic agriculture and food (58%) and the provision of sector information (58%). They <lb/>are also frequently providing or funding information and collective promotion campaigns (39%). <lb/>Diverging from this modal approach, six OECD countries have taken a different more market-orientated <lb/>approach towards the development of organic sector. Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Israel, Mexico have not <lb/>implemented policy measures to support the growth of the organic sector. The Netherlands have repealed <lb/>the measures in place until 2013 and restricts action to the enforcement of EU organic regulations. <lb/></body>

			<body>Likewise, the case of organic agriculture in France illustrates why and how <lb/>governments can make use of voluntary standards and certifications to achieve their policy <lb/>objectives. In the last decades, with co-funding from the European Union under CAP, and <lb/>through successive action plans, the French government has supported the growth of the <lb/>certified organic sector, considering it to positively contribute to environment preservation, <lb/>farm employment, and rural development. <lb/>Since 1992, support for the conversion to organic farming has been provided to farmers <lb/>under the European Regulation 2078/92/EEC. Organic agriculture was then put high on the <lb/>political agenda with the first national Action Plan designed to promote organic agriculture <lb/>and the market for organic food in 1998. The Organic Agency (Agence Bio) was created in <lb/>2001 to promote organic products and later on to manage funds for marketing projects. <lb/>Following the 1999 Agricultural Orientation Law, payments to organic farming were <lb/>incorporated into agri-environmental schemes. <lb/>The 2006 Agricultural Orientation Law established an income tax credit for organic <lb/>farmers. The support to organic agriculture was reinforced in 2007, with an ambitious <lb/>quantitative target of 6% of organically managed agricultural land by 2012 and 20% in 2020. <lb/>In support of these aims, a second Action Plan for organic agriculture was released in 2008 <lb/>for the period going to 2012. <lb/>The environmentally-friendly dimension of organic production has recently been <lb/>emphasised by the incorporation of organic agriculture within the Agro-Ecological project, a <lb/>broader governmental project promoting green growth in French agriculture. The objectives <lb/>are not only to increase the proportion of organically managed land, but also to benefit from <lb/>best practices from organic farms that may have favourable spill-overs on conventional <lb/>agriculture, e.g. mechanical weeding, bio-control of pests, long crop rotations. A new five-<lb/>year Action Plan for organic agriculture was launched in spring 2013. The Action Plan is a <lb/>policy mix with several instruments aiming at stimulating supply (e.g. training, incentives for <lb/>conversion, improving the organisation of the domestic organic sector, especially in post-farm <lb/>gate operations) and demand (e.g. public awareness campaigns, 20% of organic food in <lb/>community catering), as well as encouraging research and development. <lb/>The cross-country survey confirms that support to organic agriculture and organic food <lb/>markets are widespread in the OECD. The cross-country analysis shows that most of other <lb/>OECD governments are funding measures supporting the growth of the sector, the main <lb/>motivation being the environmental benefits associated with organically managed land <lb/>(Box 2). <lb/>Standards as an option to comply with regulation <lb/>A more direct use of voluntary standards to implement policy occurs when compliance <lb/>with a voluntary standard becomes an option to demonstrate compliance with regulation. The <lb/>2BSvs voluntary scheme for biofuels in the European Union is a good example of this. <lb/>Over the past decades, governments in OECD and emerging countries have increasingly <lb/>promoted the development of biofuels. Over time, however, and especially after the <lb/>agricultural price spikes in the late 2000s, concerns were expressed about the potential impact <lb/>of biofuels on food markets and biodiversity. At the same time, there was increasing concern <lb/>about the performance of first generation biofuels in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In <lb/>Europe, growing criticism led several countries to launch national initiatives to regulate the <lb/>biofuel industry, followed by the European Union which eventually implemented regulations <lb/>for the production, trade and use of biofuels in member countries (Moïsé and Steenblik, 2011; <lb/>Ponte, 2014). <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 35 <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/></note>

			<body>The EU Directive 2009/28/EC on Renewable Energy (known as RED, Renewable Energy <lb/>Directive) sets out sustainability criteria for biofuels in Articles 17, 18 and 19. These criteria <lb/>are related to greenhouse gas savings, conservation of land with high biodiversity value, land <lb/>with high carbon stock, and fulfilment of agro-environmental practices for agricultural <lb/>production in the EU. The criteria apply to biofuels and bioliquids produced in the EU and to <lb/>imported products. Only certified &quot; sustainable &quot; biofuels are eligible for tax benefits or can be <lb/>used to satisfy biofuel use mandates. <lb/>According to RED, economic operators in the chain must show their Member States that <lb/>the criteria have been met, either: i) by providing the relevant national authority with data, in <lb/>compliance with requirements that the Member State has laid down (a &quot; national system &quot; ); <lb/>ii) by using a &quot; voluntary scheme &quot; that the European Commission has recognised for the <lb/>purpose; iii) in accordance with the terms of a bilateral or multilateral agreement concluded <lb/>by the Union with third countries and which the European Commission has recognised for the <lb/>purpose. <lb/>Between July 2011 and January 2014, several voluntary schemes were recognised by the <lb/>European Commission, including the Biomass Biofuels Sustainability voluntary scheme <lb/>(2BSvs). The 2BSvs scheme was developed by a consortium of French producer associations <lb/>representing the bioethanol and biodiesel industries, from biomass to biofuels. Private <lb/>standards were developed to allow farmers, biomass collectors (e.g. feedstuff cooperatives <lb/>and traders) and other economic operators along the supply chain to demonstrate the <lb/>compliance of their product with the sustainability criteria of the RED and Fuel Quality <lb/>Directives. The scheme was approved by the European Commission on 19 July 2011. It <lb/>supports sustainability claims, with respect to the Directive, for biomass used as raw material <lb/>and biofuels processed from that biomass. <lb/>One advantage of voluntary schemes as an option compared to the two other compliance <lb/>options (using Member States&apos; national standards or according to the terms of an agreement <lb/>with third countries) is that they allow individual operators to choose the most appropriate and <lb/>cost-efficient standards amongst those available. At the moment, there are 15 approved <lb/>voluntary standards in the European Union, a number that is manageable for regulators and <lb/>economic operators, while allowing for some competition between the standards, avoiding <lb/>barriers to entry for operators. <lb/>Other pragmatic reasons for opting for voluntary standards initiated by the industry <lb/>include the absence of standards from specialised standardising bodies (ISO, CEN) at the time <lb/>the regulatory decision was taken, and the advantage for the EU to establish a system open to <lb/>third countries, in order to avoid accusations of implementing hidden barriers to trade, with <lb/>too prescriptive technical regulations on sustainable biofuels. The system has been <lb/>intentionally designed to facilitate trade with non-EU countries. Feedstuff for biofuel from <lb/>third countries (e.g. sugar cane, soy, palm oil) can be imported through the voluntary schemes <lb/>developed by commodity initiatives associating traders, NGOs and producers from <lb/>developing countries. The most prominent of such schemes (RSB, Bonsucro, Round Table on <lb/>Responsible Soy, and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) have all been recognised by the <lb/>European Commission. <lb/>A limitation of voluntary schemes is that they are not fully compatible with each other, <lb/>due to extra requirements on environment and social accountability included in some of them. <lb/>For example, 2BSvs is very similar to the German scheme RedCert, but not to RSB EU RED, <lb/>a sub-standard of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. Moreover, there is no provision for <lb/>automatic equivalence between voluntary standards in the EU Directive. Standard owners <lb/>have to agree to mutual recognition or to unilaterally recognise a scheme as equivalent; for <lb/>example, ISCC EU was recognised as equivalent by 2BSvs in December 2011. However, this <lb/></body>

			<body>probably does not impede sustainable biofuel trade at the end of the chain, because the <lb/>standards all respect the core RED criteria. <lb/>The 2BSvs case thus provides an illustration of complementarities between public and <lb/>private sectors in the implementation of regulatory requirements. The voluntary standard <lb/>option to comply with RED can be analysed as a move toward co-regulation in the sector of <lb/>biomass production. This approach is consistent with the promotion by the EU of a greater <lb/>use of co-regulatory mechanisms to achieve better policies and delivery. The use of voluntary <lb/>standards as an option for compliance creates flexibility and cost efficiency for producers, <lb/>while creating an open system that enables trade with non-EU countries. <lb/>A related example of how policymakers can rely on private standards to implement public <lb/>policy objectives concerns the case of liability rules. Although not widespread in <lb/>environmental policy (at least when dealing with farms), the approach has gained importance <lb/>in food safety policy. Operators in the food chain are subject to governmental food regulation <lb/>and inspections, but they are also regulated under general commercial, civil and criminal law. <lb/>Under liability rules, they could be sued for negligence or breach of warranty in the event of <lb/>consumer poisoning. In such cases, the implementation of internal standards may show that <lb/>all reasonable care has been exercised to avoid harm. <lb/>In the United Kingdom, the 1990 Food Safety Act introduced a strict liability for food <lb/>businesses but also a &quot; due diligence &quot; clause. The objective is to encourage all concerned to <lb/>take proper responsibility for their products. In England and Wales, Crown courts may send <lb/>offenders to prison for up to two years or impose unlimited fines. With the obligation of <lb/>reasonable care, companies in consumer markets such as major retailers are prompted to <lb/>closely monitor their food suppliers. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) standards have <lb/>been developed by a working group of retailers and other stakeholders in response to the UK <lb/>Food Safety Act, to fulfil legal obligations and demonstrate due diligence (Humphrey, 2012). <lb/>The incentive effect of limited liability rules should not be overestimated, however. For <lb/>consumers, foodborne diseases are difficult to trace back to individual food companies or <lb/>restaurants, so that consumers face high information costs. In countries where food safety is <lb/>covered by tort or contract law, they also face high transaction costs to engage in litigation <lb/>with firms and the compensation from courts is generally uncertain and low, except in the <lb/>case of severe injury or death (Buzby and Frenzen, 1999). Nevertheless, the use of private <lb/>standards as a way of demonstrating &quot; due diligence &quot; provides another example of synergies <lb/>between voluntary standards and regulation. <lb/>Mandatory standard <lb/>A final possibility for public interaction with private standards is for governments to <lb/>make compliance with the private standard mandatory. <lb/>Again, food safety provides an example of this approach. As in industrial safety and <lb/>environmental protection (Coglianese and Lazer, 2003), food safety has seen a major shift <lb/>from technology-based regulation to management-based regulation, as the prescriptive <lb/>mandatory rules of agencies enforced by regular on-site inspection are replaced by the <lb/>implementation of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plans and firm <lb/>quality management systems (Humphrey, 2012). <lb/>In the United States, mandatory HACCP plans have started in the meat and poultry <lb/>industries in 1996 to prevent pathogenic contamination and foodborne illness. HACCP was <lb/>made compulsory for the seafood industry in 1999 and selected fruit juice categories in 2001 <lb/>(Rouvière and Caswell, 2012). Today, the use of HACCP is mandated by the Food and Drug <lb/>Administration (FDA) for high-risk food products, e.g. low acid canned food, fruit juices and <lb/>shrimp (Humphrey, 2012). <lb/></body>

			<body>In the European Union, the Hygiene Package in force since 1 January 2006 as an <lb/>application of the EU General Food Law (Regulation (EC) No 178/2012) is putting primary <lb/>responsibility for food safety on the food business operator and requires operators to <lb/>implement HACCP procedures (Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of <lb/>foodstuffs). The regulation provides a list of criteria for HACCP plans but gives considerable <lb/>flexibility to individual operators in their implementation of control measures (Bonnaud and <lb/>Coppalle, 2013; Garcia-Martinez et al., 2013). In addition, the European Union encourages <lb/>the development, dissemination and use of both national and Community Guides to Good <lb/>Practice, used on a voluntary basis by food business operators. <lb/>Monitoring compliance <lb/>In addition to the synergies in regulatory design and in policy implementation identified <lb/>above, interaction with private standards and private certification bodies may also allow <lb/>governments to monitor compliance at lower administrative costs. <lb/>In France, one of the authorities in charge of enforcing food law, the DGCCRF, has <lb/>negotiated self-monitoring agreements with a group of importers to control compliance in the <lb/>fresh produce import market. Importers in the town of Perpignan are engaged with the Board <lb/>of Importers, which negotiates with the DGCCRF and is responsible for guaranteeing the <lb/>importers&apos; commitment regarding their checks of the legally-mandated MRLs for pesticides. <lb/>The private scheme involves procedures based on HACCP, product sampling and multi-<lb/>residues testing (Codron et al., 2007; Rouvière and Caswell, 2012). <lb/>In the United Kingdom, the Food Safety Agency sets the frequency of farm inspections <lb/>based on the membership in private farm assurance schemes, such as the widely diffused <lb/>AFS. The average inspection rating for compliance with EU food hygiene legislation is 2% <lb/>compared to 25% for farms not enrolled in a voluntary scheme. In dairy farming, the members <lb/>of the &apos;Red Tractor&apos; Assured Dairy Farm scheme also enjoy reduced hygiene inspection, with <lb/>one official inspection only every 10 years. As regards to the Industrial Emissions Directive <lb/>(previously named Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive), the producers of <lb/>pig and poultry members of an assurance scheme have one inspection per year from their <lb/>certification body, rather than two inspections by the UK Environmental Agency. In the <lb/>Netherlands, food business operators that purchase their raw materials or ingredients from <lb/>suppliers enrolled in the RiskPlaza scheme created by an industry trade association are <lb/>exempted from being checked by the New food and consumer product safety authority <lb/>(nVWA) as regards to their HACCP obligations (Garcia-Martinez et al., 2013). <lb/>Additional examples of synergies between public and private standards in monitoring <lb/>compliance are found in the case studies of Bio Suisse in Switzerland and the EKO Quality <lb/>Mark in the Netherlands. The two countries have implemented national organic rules in the <lb/>1990s; the Netherlands in 1991 to fulfil Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91, and Switzerland <lb/>in 1997 with the Federal Ordinance 910.18. In both countries, more stringent private organic <lb/>standards are coexisting with the public standard embedded in regulation. <lb/>In the early days of organic farming in Switzerland, organic labelling initiatives were <lb/>founded by farmer associations and other NGOs. In the late 1970s, more than 30 locally <lb/>organised organic associations coexisted, with different rules about organic practices. Claims <lb/>were often not supported by an independent and neutral conformity assessment. The <lb/>fragmentation across organisations and regions (Cantons), and the lack of credibility were <lb/>challenging the growth of the organic food sector in the Confederation. Moreover, at that <lb/>time, the Federal government was sceptical about the &quot; ökologisch &quot; and &quot; biologique &quot; claims, <lb/>which were to some degree considered to be misleading and not scientifically sound. Rather <lb/>than introducing a national legislation, the government pushed local organic associations to <lb/>create a common standard. The Association of Swiss Organic Agriculture Organisations (Bio <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">38 – VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>Suisse) was founded in 1981 as an umbrella organisation for local Swiss organic associations. <lb/>The same year, it set out the first standard for organic cultivation. <lb/>The Federal Ordinance 910.18 on Organic Farming and the Labelling of Organically <lb/>Produced Products and Foodstuffs was prepared much later, in the mid-1990s, to provide <lb/>common rules for the domestic organic market, in order to improve further the coherence of <lb/>the organic value chain, as part of the policy for food product quality. <lb/>The Bio Suisse standard is more stringent than the requirements of the national regulation <lb/>in a number of farming practice areas. For example, there is no exception to the principle of <lb/>whole-farm organic management, the list of permitted plant protection agents is more limited <lb/>and the requirements for crop rotation are stricter (e.g. 24 month break between main crops of <lb/>the same family). <lb/>The &quot; Bud &quot; label associated with Bio Suisse standard achieves a high profile among Swiss <lb/>consumers. As more than 90% of Swiss organic farms are Bio Suisse certified, and as <lb/>compliance with the national organic regulation is mandatory for all organic farms since <lb/>1997, coexistence between private and public standards is an important issue. The potential <lb/>duplication of controls and the associated excessive burden on farmers are avoided by the <lb/>cross-accreditation of private control bodies and the cost-efficient design of conformity <lb/>assessment. <lb/>Bio.inspecta and Bio Test, the two private certifiers recognised by the Bio Suisse <lb/>association, are also recognised by the Federal Office for Agriculture, the Competent <lb/>Authority responsible for the implementation of the Ordinance. Therefore, to reduce fees and <lb/>transaction costs for farmers, the certifier is simultaneously assessing compliance to the public <lb/>and the private standard. The certifiers have developed a common checklist for organic farm <lb/>inspection. Since each checkpoint includes many criteria to be assessed, the certifiers have <lb/>their own more detailed checklists in order to conduct comprehensive assessments. Moreover, <lb/>the certifiers have agreed on a catalogue of enforcement measures and sanctions, which <lb/>corresponds to the general checklist, and also helps to avoid duplication of sanctions. <lb/>A similar example of how synergies can be achieved in monitoring compliance is <lb/>provided by the case of the EKO Quality Mark in the Netherlands. A number of private <lb/>environmental certification schemes for agricultural produce have been developed in the <lb/>Netherlands since the 1990s, complementing national and EU legislation in this area. The <lb/>initiatives were taken by farmers, retailers and food processors, to reduce the risk of negative <lb/>impacts of intensive agriculture on environment and biodiversity, and to differentiate <lb/>production. <lb/>The EKO Quality Mark for organic agriculture is a private standard which was introduced <lb/>as early as 1991, the same year as the publication of Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91. At <lb/>that time, the mark was owned by SKAL, a private, non-profit foundation with a public task <lb/>as inspection body for the organic production in the Netherlands. <lb/>The EKO Quality Mark signals the additional efforts of organic companies in the field of <lb/>sustainability to their consumers and buyers. For instance, the EKO Quality Mark includes <lb/>requirements on the use of green energy, clean fuels or renewable packaging. This means the <lb/>EKO Mark goes further than the EU requirements for organic farming. Since 2012, the EKO <lb/>Mark became a private label owned by the EKO Mark Foundation. <lb/>SKAL – the organisation which initially owned the EKO Quality Mark – is the only <lb/>control body recognised for providing inspections and certification according to EU <lb/>regulations. The rationale for this monopoly is to reassure the consumer that a claim about <lb/>organic food is justified, and that products labelled as organic actually originate from an <lb/>organic production process. Apart from controlling the production process, SKAL also <lb/>VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 39 <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/></note>

			<body>assesses post farm-gate operations. In consequence, SKAL oversees the entire organic food <lb/>chain in the Netherlands. <lb/>Given that the EKO Quality Mark uses the same certification system and certifier, both <lb/>administrative costs and transaction costs for farmers related to on-site inspections are <lb/>reduced. In addition, the definition of the EKO requirements and its certification system as an <lb/>extension of the EU organic regulations implies the full marketability of organic products <lb/>bearing the &apos;Euro Leaf&apos; logo across the European Union, in line with the principles of the EU <lb/>common market. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Rising consumer expectations regarding food is the key driver of voluntary standards in <lb/>agriculture, including environment-related standards. In addition, for retailers, the use of <lb/>standards is part of their supply chain management, in a context of increasingly global <lb/>sourcing of agricultural commodities. The use of a third-party certification also contributes to <lb/>protect brand equity and prevent agri-food companies against commercial risk. This is <lb/>obvious for product safety, where no failure is tolerated, but it is increasingly also the case for <lb/>environment conservation, the controversy over unsustainable production of palm oil being an <lb/>illuminating example. For agri-food companies, environmental standards are part of social <lb/>responsibility commitments. Finally, as shown by organic agriculture, voluntary standards <lb/>may also aim at differentiating products and segmenting mature food markets. <lb/>In addition to the effort of the private sector to ensure consistent delivery and <lb/>implementation of voluntary standards, public initiatives provide the institutional framework <lb/>to make food markets work better. The main rationale for governmental intervention with <lb/>voluntary standards is to prevent fraud and free-riding by competitors. The regulatory options <lb/>include the protection of trademarks and brands, banning fraudulent or misleading claims, or <lb/>mandating the disclosure of certain information. In addition, government can intervene to <lb/>foster market integration by harmonising existing voluntary standards, to stimulate the <lb/>creation of standards or to develop a public standard, to increase the credibility of industry <lb/>initiatives, and by overseeing or playing an active role in the certification business. The case <lb/>of organic agriculture within and outside the OECD confirms that market issues have been the <lb/>main spur for developing public standards embedded in regulations; in particular the <lb/>motivations were to protect consumers against misleading claims and to facilitate trade, <lb/>domestically and internationally. <lb/>In addition to regulating voluntary standards, governments can use standards to achieve <lb/>policy objectives in a more effective way. Such synergies are most likely to occur in the <lb/>stages of regulatory design, policy implementation, and monitoring. <lb/>Synergies in regulatory design can occur if national governments can build their public <lb/>regulations on existing private standards. Governments can avoid the costs of developing <lb/>regulations from scratch, and the public regulations have the benefit of having been tested by <lb/>others. In addition, if public regulations are built on widely accepted private standards, this <lb/>practice helps to reduce potential trade frictions that could arise from differences in national <lb/>regulation and makes it possible to recognise foreign regulations as equivalent. <lb/>In terms of policy implementation, the interactions between policymakers and standards <lb/>can take many forms, ranging from a &quot; laissez-faire &quot; approach where the government trusts in <lb/>self-regulation of the industry to a situation where the government makes an existing standard <lb/>mandatory. The case studies shed light on intermediate solutions. <lb/>Governments can endorse existing standards in several ways, including through <lb/>equivalence recognition mechanisms. Governments can stimulate the supply or demand of <lb/>40 – VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/>certified products, provided that there are associated environmental benefits. To facilitate <lb/>policy implementation, governments could also use voluntary standards as an option to <lb/>comply with regulation. For producers, the option to use a voluntary standard gives them the <lb/>option to choose the most appropriate and cost-efficient standard. Finally, standards can be <lb/>used to obtain synergies in monitoring compliance to allow a reduction in compliance costs, <lb/>since compliance to both private standards and public policies and regulations can be assessed <lb/>during a single on-site inspection. <lb/>In general, governments may rely on private bodies when implementing policies because <lb/>they acknowledge different capabilities of private businesses and central or local <lb/>administrations, which may be used to efficiently reach objectives. Regarding standard <lb/>development and the integration of environmental criteria, private actors have the ability to <lb/>tailor standards to industry best practices, incorporating local knowledge and taking into <lb/>account economic constraints in a cost-effective way. Governmental organisations, on the <lb/>other hand, may have a comparative advantage in managing conflicting views within <lb/>stakeholder fora, building consensus, providing scientific soundness, and instilling trust in <lb/>standards. As regards to compliance, relying on law, governments have strong capabilities to <lb/>sanction misconduct. Other potential benefits of collaboration are increased &quot; buy in &quot; of the <lb/>policy process, greater responsiveness and lower overhead thanks to the involvement of the <lb/>industry and interested parties. <lb/>The weaknesses of this approach are potentially anti-competitive activities and the <lb/>development of barriers to entry for outsiders. The loss of control over the policy process is <lb/>often emphasised, with a risk of regulatory capture. More specifically, making explicit <lb/>reference to private standards in regulations would entail certain major drawbacks. In <lb/>addition, as shown by several case studies, when using private standards in policy <lb/>implementation, it is important to develop procedures to recognise initiatives of the level <lb/>required for general interest purpose. Discrepancies with the objectives laid down may also <lb/>occur in the enforcement of policies, which make it important to develop procedures to <lb/>oversee operators and auditors, in particular through second-level controls by public <lb/>authorities. <lb/>VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 41 <lb/>OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015 <lb/></note>
