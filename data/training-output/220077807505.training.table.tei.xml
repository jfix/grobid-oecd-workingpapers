The paper first appeared as a<lb/> chapter for the OECD Economics Survey of Belgium, published in July 2009 under the responsibility of the<lb/> Economic and Development Review Committee. The author is grateful to Jens Høj for his support and<lb/> guidance for this work. He would also like to thank OECD colleagues Andrew Dean and Robert Ford,<lb/> Pierre Beynet, Mike Wise and Taylor Reynolds, and Maria Sicilia from the IEA, among others, for useful<lb/> comments, as well as Sylvie Foucher-Hantala for statistical assistance and Veronique Henriksson and Sylvie<lb/> Ricordeau for secretarial assistance.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The figures presented do not take account of differences in VAT tax rates across countries. However, although<lb/> the Belgian standard VAT rate is higher than in many euro area countries, the differences are of a small order<lb/> of magnitude (on average 1.6 percentage point higher) and would not change the conclusion. Furthermore the<lb/> Belgian VAT tax is characterised by a large number of reductions and exemptions (OECD, 2009).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)77<lb/> 6<lb/> Table 1.
