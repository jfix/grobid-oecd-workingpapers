Budgets balances were positive, debt-to-GDP ratios <lb/>were low, and monetary policy was more credible thanks to low inflation and well-anchored <lb/>expectations. Moreover, in contrast with the past, some of the countries in the region were able to <lb/>enact fiscal stimulus packages comparable to those of OECD countries. Is Latin America&apos;s new <lb/>resilience a permanent change? Some questions may require time to be responded, such as the <lb/>effectiveness of counter-cyclical fiscal impulses. But some may be responded right now, <lb/>particularly the cyclical or structural nature of recent fiscal improvements. <lb/>This paper by Christian Daude, Ángel Melguizo and Alejandro Neut, economists of the <lb/>OECD Development Centre, contributes to this relevant debate: fiscal solvency is a precondition <lb/>for sustainable development policies, and the ability to have a counter-cyclical policy is an <lb/>important tool to support the poor and vulnerable during downturns. The paper analyses fiscal <lb/>policy in the main economies in Latin America during the last two decades. It uses the OECD <lb/>methodology to measure structural balances, but it also takes into account the central role that <lb/>commodities play in several countries in the region. All in all, underneath the observed positive <lb/>indicators, the analysis of cyclically-adjusted balances and debt sustainability confirms that most <lb/>countries were in better position before the crisis. However, tax automatic stabilisers in Latin <lb/>America are still small, around half the OECD average. Concerning discretionary fiscal impulses, <lb/>they continue to be broadly pro-cyclical, but in some countries policy response to the last cycle <lb/>has been more stabilising. Finally, the authors document a great degree of uncertainty <lb/>concerning output gap estimates in Latin America which – combined with wide commodity <lb/>cycles – add an extra layer of complexity for policy makers in the region. <lb/>This paper is elaborated within the Fiscal pillar of the LAC-OECD Initiative &quot; Fiscal <lb/>Policy: Improving Taxation and Public Expenditure &quot; , a joint project of the Centre for Tax Policy <lb/>and Administration and the Development Centre, supported by Spain, Chile and Mexico. We <lb/>hope that this working paper will contribute to a better informed debate on fiscal policy, helping <lb/>ultimately to improve the wellbeing of the people in Latin America. <lb/>Mario Pezzini <lb/>Director <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>July 2010 <lb/>Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2010)8 <lb/>6 <lb/>© OECD 2010 <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Cette étude analyse la politique budgétaire dans huit économies d&apos;Amérique Latine, à <lb/>partir du début des années 1990 et jusqu&apos;à 2009.

			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>In reaction to the 2009 global financial crisis, most industrialised and several emerging <lb/>economies enacted Keynesian-type fiscal packages (from personal income tax cuts and indirect <lb/>taxes reductions, to higher infrastructure spending and transfers to local governments, families, <lb/>and firms) to mitigate the collapse of domestic demand. <lb/>Several Latin American economies faced the international crisis on relatively solid <lb/>domestic macroeconomic grounds, both monetary and fiscal. On the fiscal front, most countries <lb/>in the region displayed higher budget surpluses and lower debt-to-GDP levels, giving them <lb/>apparently unprecedented fiscal margins to pursue sustainable counter-cyclical fiscal policies, of <lb/>a similar size of those in OECD countries (see OECD, 2009b) 1 . <lb/>But, is Latin America&apos;s resilience in 2009 a permanent change in paradigm? The success of <lb/>these counter-cyclical fiscal policy responses in Latin American economies is still unclear, and <lb/>will largely depend on both the size of the programmes actually implemented (generally smaller <lb/>and with greater lags than announced) and their effective impact (opening, once again, the <lb/>debate on multipliers). Besides, at the wake of the international financial crisis there was no <lb/>consensus on the cyclical or structural nature of still recent fiscal improvements <lb/>2 . <lb/>Our paper joins the latter debate. In section two we present updated original estimates of <lb/>cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances for a number of Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, <lb/>Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. We track these balances since the early <lb/>nineties to 2009, implementing the standardised OECD methodology (Girouard and André, 2005, <lb/>and Van den Noord, 2000), but adding the fiscal impact of commodity prices (following basically <lb/>the IMF approach in Vladkova and Zettelmeyer, 2008). With these estimates, we can then <lb/>measure the size of automatic stabilisation tax policies and the size and cyclicality of discretional <lb/>fiscal policy. These measures are compared with those in OECD countries and used to discuss <lb/></body>

			<body>Hausmann (1008) for Latin America, and Talvi and Vegh (2005), Kaminsky et al. (2006), and Ilzetzki and <lb/>Vegh (2008) for emerging markets in general. <lb/>2 Izquierdo and Talvi (2008), from the Inter-American Development Bank, argued that if revenues from the <lb/>seven largest economies in Latin America countries were adjusted using the implicit Hodrick-Prescott <lb/>filter parameter for Chile (i.e. the smoothing coefficient on revenues that would render a structural <lb/>surplus of one per cent of GDP since 2001), structural fiscal balances in the region, with the exception of <lb/>Chile, did not differ significantly from their situation at the onset of the 1998 Russian crisis. Using a <lb/>different methodological approach, Vladkova-Hollar and Zettelmeyer (2008), from the International <lb/>Monetary Fund, observed an improvement in structural balances in most countries, although they <lb/>point out that commodity prices added a significant layer of uncertainty. <lb/></body>

The <lb/>third section explains the methodology used to estimate the output gap. We opt for an <lb/>unobserved components model to decompose shocks into permanent, cyclical and transitory. <lb/>Section four concludes, underlining the importance of output gap estimates, the inclusion of <lb/>commodity prices and the consideration of automatic fiscal responses in the design of <lb/>sustainable fiscal policies over the business cycle in the region. <lb/>Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2010)8 <lb/>10 <lb/>© OECD 2010 <lb/>II. CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED BUDGET BALANCES IN LATIN AMERICA <lb/>II.1. OECD approach to estimation of cyclically-adjusted fiscal revenues <lb/>As a starting point, we apply the OECD approach to account for the automatic impact of <lb/>the business cycle on public accounts, as presented in detail by Girouard and Andre (2005) for <lb/>OECD countries, and De Mello and Moccero (2006) for Brazil. This method computes separately <lb/>the cyclical component of unemployment-related transfers and of public receipts from four types <lb/>of taxes: personal income tax (PIT), social security contributions (SSC), and corporate income tax <lb/>(CIT), and indirect taxes (IT), and of unemployment-related transfers. <lb/>Focusing on public revenues, the cyclical response of tax i to the business cycle (labelled ε <lb/>ti,,y) is calculated as the product of two elasticities: the elasticity of tax receipts to the tax base <lb/>(labelled ε ti,,tbi) and the elasticity of the tax base to the economic cycle (labelled ε tbi,,y): <lb/>ε ti,,y = ε ti,,tbi × ε tbi,,y <lb/>(1) <lb/>where i covers the four taxes mentioned above (PIT, SSC, CIT or IT) or their respective tax bases <lb/>(wage bill for the first two, corporate profits and consumption). <lb/>On the expenditure side, the adjustment is usually made at the level of total primary <lb/>spending as time-series data on unemployment-related expenditure are not available across <lb/>countries. Girouard and Andre (2005) use several OECD instruments, publications and <lb/>databases, especially the Annual National Accounts, the Economic Outlook database, national Labour <lb/>Force Surveys, the Taxing Wages model, and Revenue Statistics. Next, we describe the methodology <lb/>more in depth while explaining the approach we follow for Latin American economies. <lb/>Personal income tax and social security contributions <lb/>To calculate the elasticity of income tax and social security contributions with respect to <lb/>the tax base, the marginal and the average tax rates of a representative household are calculated <lb/>for several points in the earnings distribution: from 0.5 to 3.0 times the average production <lb/>worker in each OECD country. A representative household is defined as a full-time, two-earner <lb/>married couple with two children, with the secondary earner receiving 50 per cent of the wage of <lb/>the principal earner. Effective tax rates are computed using the OECD Taxing Wages simulator, <lb/>while the distribution of tax payers across income levels in each country are based on labour <lb/>market statistics (based on median, first and ninth deciles incomes taken from Labour Force <lb/>Surveys). The overall elasticities of both PIT and SSC with respect to the tax base (ε ti,,tbi) are <lb/>calculated as the weighted ratios of marginal and average tax rates: <lb/></body>

We proxy the distribution of <lb/>potential tax payers using the latest available National Household Surveys <lb/>3 in Argentina <lb/>(referred to 2006), Brazil (2006) 4 , Chile (2006), Colombia (2008), Costa Rica (2006), Mexico (2006), <lb/>Peru (2006), and Uruguay (2005). In particular, we calculate the &apos;adjusted first earner income&apos; <lb/>distribution taking into account household composition (if two earners exist, the first earner is <lb/>assigned two thirds of household income while second earner is assigned the rest). We restrict <lb/>our analysis to labour income (dependent and self-employed workers) 5 , and limit the sample to <lb/>households with at least some labour income <lb/>6 . Given the high levels of informality and income <lb/>inequality in the region, we analyze an extended income interval, covering from 0.05 times <lb/>average income (i.e. almost from the first peso/sol/real of labour income) to more than six times <lb/>average income. <lb/>Figure 1 represents the average adjusted income level and those corresponding to the first <lb/>and ninth deciles, corrected by purchasing power parities. Average annual labour income level <lb/>ranges from 7.700 $ PPP in Peru, to nearly 14.600 $ PPP in Chile. Workers in the ninth decile earn <lb/>more than twice the average in all countries, while low earners vary significantly (in Peru, those <lb/>in the first decile earn 20 times less than the average income, while only five times less in Costa <lb/>Rica). <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2010 <lb/>Focusing on the distribution of labour income earners, the analysis shows a high <lb/>concentration of workers below the average labour income: between 60 and 70 per cent of labour <lb/>income earners earn less than the national average (Figure 2).

Chilean and Uruguayan figures were provided by <lb/>the respective Ministries of Finance, while Mexican rates were calculating using the OECD <lb/>Taxing Wages simulator. For other countries, we calculated the fiscal figures based on the <lb/>legislation in place during the corresponding fiscal year. <lb/>Calculations are referred to 2006, because several of the household surveys available are <lb/>from that year, and as it corresponds to a relatively neutral year in cyclical terms (in the case of <lb/>Colombia, we deflated the data referred to 2008 with the national CPI). The only exception is <lb/>Uruguay, in which we updated survey figures with observed CPI up to 2009 to incorporate the <lb/>new personal income tax established in 2008. In those cases where fiscal legislation allows <lb/>individual and household declaration, we chose the one more beneficial to tax payers, including <lb/>allowances for both espouse and children, if existing <lb/>8 .

We grouped all <lb/>households that earn more than six times the national average (this last bracket earns between eight <lb/>times the average in Uruguay, to 11 times in Chile). <lb/>8 Tax declarations are at the individual level in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay, and by households in <lb/>Argentina, Costa Rica and Mexico.

Brazilian figures, taken from De Mello and Moccero (2006), are on an individual basis. <lb/>Therefore, we fix both income distribution and tax legislation, as stated in the OECD methodology.

Second, with the <lb/>exception of Mexico (due to the interaction of exempted income, individual declarations and tax <lb/>credits), labour income earners are net payers of the PIT starting at levels ranging from the <lb/>average income in Chile to three times the average income in Colombia. Together with <lb/>informality, these high levels imply that only a small share of households with labour income is a <lb/>net PIT payer. <lb/>Figure 4.

Adjustment of tax and non-tax revenues for commodity prices <lb/>A special feature of several Latin American countries is the importance of commodity <lb/>prices for its fiscal accounts, whether it is due to a significant share of taxation linked to rents in <lb/>natural resource extraction, or the utilities of state-owned enterprises in these sectors. Not only <lb/>are commodity-linked revenues important as a source of revenue, but they also tend to be very <lb/>volatile, primarily due to large fluctuations in prices. Therefore, they are also relevant for fiscal <lb/>sustainability and macroeconomic stability (Avendaño et al., 2008) <lb/>10 . <lb/>Figure 8 shows copper revenues as a share of GDP in Chile from 1990 to 2009. Copper <lb/>revenues during this period have risen from less than 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1999 up to more <lb/>than 12 per cent of GDP in 2006. Compared with total revenues, these revenues are more than <lb/>five times more volatile (copper revenues have a coefficient of variation of 1.01 versus 0.18 for <lb/>total revenues). Thus, it is necessary to separate this source of income in countries where <lb/>commodities are important for fiscal revenues and perform a special adjustment for commodity <lb/>price fluctuations. <lb/>Figure 8.

In contrast to the nineties, <lb/>during 2000-2005 African commodity-exporters have shown a more counter-cyclical fiscal stance, <lb/>displaying various positive macroeconomic developments (notably, reserves accumulation, exports <lb/>diversification, and improved credit profile). Results are more modest in Latin America. <lb/></body>

			<body>Unfortunately, the OECD methodology is silent regarding this issue. <lb/>11 Therefore, we <lb/>follow a similar methodology to the Chilean fiscal rule (see Marcel et al., 2001 and Rodríguez et <lb/>al., 2007) and recent IMF work on this topic in Latin America and the Caribbean (e.g. Vladkova-<lb/>Hollar and Zettelmeyer, 2008). The adjustment is made for Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru. 12 <lb/>In Argentina, we consider export taxes on agricultural goods introduced in 2002. For Chile, we <lb/>consider revenues transferred to the central government from the public copper company <lb/>(CODELCO) and revenues from specific taxes on private mining firms. 13 In the case of Mexico, <lb/>we use international oil price data to adjust the value of transfers from the public oil firm <lb/>(PEMEX) to the federal government, royalties and revenues of specific taxes on oil and petrol <lb/>derivatives. It is important to point out that there are differences – due to data availability <lb/>restrictions – between how we treat public enterprises in the commodity sector for Chile and <lb/>Mexico. While for Chile we consider the general government, which implies that we do consider <lb/>only the transfers and income taxes paid by CODELCO, for Mexico we used the non-financial <lb/>public sector. Finally, in the case of Peru, we consider royalties and income taxes of the mining <lb/>and fishing industries, adjusted by a weighted average (according to their share in revenues) of <lb/>international copper, gold and fishmeal prices. In Annex A.3 we present more details on the <lb/>series and data sources. <lb/>In terms of the adjustment, we first separate revenues (tax and non-tax) into revenues <lb/>related to commodities and non-commodity revenues. The latter are adjusted as indicated in the <lb/>section II.1 by the business cycle. For commodity-related revenues, we proceed as follows. <lb/>Considering a spot price of p and a long-run price of the relevant commodity price p * , structural <lb/>commodity-linked revenues at time t are given by: <lb/>γ <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>= <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>c <lb/>t <lb/>c <lb/>t <lb/>s <lb/>p <lb/>p <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>* <lb/>, <lb/>. <lb/>(5) <lb/>As Marcel et al. (2001) and Vladkova-Hollar and Zettelmeyer (2008), we consider a <lb/>unitary elasticity, such that γ = 1. For p * , we considered four different options, depending on <lb/>available information: future prices, five-year-ahead forecasts, a 10-year moving average or a <lb/>reference price set by a panel of experts (the case of copper in Chile). As shown in Figure 9 for <lb/>the case of copper, a 10-year moving average coincides roughly with the forecasts of the experts&apos; <lb/>panel, with the exception of 2009. For the latest year, it seems that experts consider a larger <lb/>fraction of the recent rise in copper prices to be persistent. We discard future markets, as they <lb/>11 For Norway, OECD exercises are carried out using Norway-mainland fiscal and national accounts that <lb/>exclude the oil and natural gas sector in a consistent way. There is no such information available for <lb/>Mexico or Chile. <lb/>12 Commodity prices are also important in the other countries studied here, but their impact on the fiscal <lb/>accounts is mainly through the business cycle rather than an autonomous effect for these economies. <lb/>For the case of Colombia, it is important to point out that energy and mining related revenues represent <lb/>close to 1 per cent of GDP, but are expected to play an important role in the near future (see Comité <lb/>Técnico Interinstitucional, 2010). <lb/>13 Although other metals like molybdenum, gold and silver are also produced in Chile, copper remains by far <lb/>the most important source of revenues. <lb/>Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2010)8 <lb/>22 <lb/>© OECD 2010 <lb/>prove to be relatively small and shallow (probably with the exception of oil futures), and prices <lb/>tend to be very volatile. In what follows, we report our results based on the 10-year moving <lb/>average price. Commodity revenues are not separately adjusted by the output gap, given that <lb/>commodity prices are already significantly linked to the business cycle. <lb/>Figure 9.

The <lb/>results for Argentina and Peru indicate that around half of commodity revenues could be <lb/>considered transitory in 2007, although the absolute magnitudes are smaller than for Chile or <lb/>Mexico.

			<body>According to our estimates, at the onset of the crisis, adjusted primary balances were in <lb/>equilibrium or surplus in a majority of countries (1 p.p of GDP in Peru, 2 p.p. in Uruguay, <lb/>2.5 p.p. in Brazil, almost 3 p.p. in Chile and Colombia, and 5 p.p. in Costa Rica; -1.0 p.p. in <lb/>Argentina and -3.6 p.p. in Mexico). So, even taking into account the positive economic and <lb/>commodity price cycles, these figures confirm that the region faced the crisis in relatively good <lb/>shape. The figure also highlights the significant impact of the economic cycle; especially in <lb/>Argentina and Uruguay (automatic stabilisers via revenue contributed more than 4 p.p. of GDP <lb/>to sustain aggregate demand). Finally, commodity prices (copper, gold and oil) contributed <lb/>significantly to improve fiscal positions in latest years (around 1 p.p. in Argentina, 2 p.p. in <lb/>Mexico, 3 p.p. in Peru and over 6 p.p. in Chile). Obviously, 2009 figures reflect a generalised <lb/>deterioration, driven by cyclical, commodity related and discretionary factors <lb/>14 . <lb/>Next, we explore the pro-cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy in the standard way, <lb/>comparing the variation of the adjusted primary balance and the output gap level. Fiscal policy is <lb/>defined as counter-cyclical if the surplus increases (deficit decreases) in a year with positive <lb/>output gap, or if the deficit increases (surplus decreases) when the output gap is negative. As <lb/>represented in Figure 11, in the last two decades discretionary fiscal policy in Latin America has <lb/>tended to be pro-cyclical (the correlation coefficient is –0.37 and in more than 60 per cent of cases, <lb/>53 out of the 144 cases, discretionary fiscal policy was not stabilising). <lb/>Figure 11.

Access <lb/>to stable funding (both internal and external) determined the size of announced fiscal packages in the <lb/>region. Chile and Peru were the top performers in the &quot; fiscal resilience index &quot; constructed by the OECD <lb/>(2009b); an index that takes into account the external debt to exports ratio (a standard fiscal solvency <lb/>indicator), the financing cost of fiscal expansions (proxied by the JP Morgan&apos;s EMBI Global spreads), <lb/>and the government&apos;s pre-crisis budget balance with respect to GDP.

			<note place="footnote">© OECD 2010 <lb/>From a national perspective, no country has benefited from sustained countercyclical <lb/>discretionary fiscal policy, and in all cases, countries show a majority of pro-cyclical fiscal <lb/>impulses (the most favourable cases are Brazil and Mexico, with 46 and 47 per cent of stabilising <lb/>episodes, respectively). In spite of that, based on the correlations of the variation of the adjusted <lb/>budget balance and output gap level, Chile shows to some extent a countercyclical patter (0.35), <lb/>while in Colombia and Peru discretionary fiscal policy has been fairly neutral (coefficients of <lb/>correlation of 0.01 and -0.07 respectively). Argentina and Uruguay show the highest pro-<lb/>cyclically, driven mainly by the impact and policy response to the 2002 crisis (if this episode is <lb/>excluded, Uruguayan fiscal policy has been fairly neutral). Additionally, we find no clear <lb/>progress in this field in the last decade. From 2000, fiscal policy has been more pro-cyclical (-0.49 <lb/>from 2000 vs. -0.22 from 1990 to 1999) or as pro-cyclical at best (-0.18 when controlling for the <lb/>2002 crisis). With these criteria, good practices stem again from Costa Rica, where discretionary <lb/>fiscal policy has turned counter-cyclical, and Chile (where it was maintained throughout the <lb/>period analysed). <lb/>We also test whether these results are symmetric along the economic cycle. Using this <lb/>simplified approach, discretionary fiscal policy seems to be more pro-cyclical in the crisis, when <lb/>output gap remains negative (correlation of -0.44) than in booms (-0.15). So, apparently, the pro-<lb/>cyclicality of fiscal policy in the region is not explained by the existence of profligate <lb/>governments, but with either internally or externally credit rationed countries, as dramatically <lb/>shown in 2002 crisis, where a huge fiscal adjustment was implemented in a deep crisis <lb/>environment in Argentina and Uruguay. Excluding this big shock, no significant difference <lb/>remains between booms and (regular) busts, an issue that should be borne in mind when setting <lb/>fiscal rules and institutions. Of course, if the fiscal authorities in the country are aware of the <lb/>potential impact of such large negative shocks, one could still make the argument that it would <lb/>be optimal to save more during the good times. However, when it comes to design fiscal rules, it <lb/>is important to take into account that emerging markets might lose exogenously access to finance <lb/>during times of turmoil. <lb/>While the main focus of this paper is on the cyclicality of fiscal policy in Latin America <lb/>and the estimation of structural balances, the issue of fiscal sustainability has been of importance <lb/>for the region, given its recurrent debt problems. Overall, in recent times there has been a <lb/>reduction of debt-to-GDP levels in the region. However, there are considerable differences <lb/>within the region. On the one hand, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico (after the &quot; tequila crisis &quot; ), and <lb/>Peru reduced their debt-to-GDP levels over the last decade and more. Peru and Chile had debt <lb/>levels of almost 80 per cent of GDP in the early 1990s, while nowadays exhibit levels around <lb/>25 per cent of GDP. Less pronounced, but still significant, has been the debt burden reductions in <lb/>Costa Rica and Mexico from close to 50 per cent of GDP in the mid-1990s to less than 30 per cent <lb/>in 2008. On the other hand, Argentina and Uruguay have suffered both a debt crisis during the <lb/>collapse of their fixed exchange rate regimes and associated banking crises in 2001-2002. Since <lb/>then, in part due to debt restructuring, but also due to economic growth and fiscal surpluses they <lb/>have reduced their debt levels down to around 50 per cent of GDP, which are higher levels than <lb/>ten years ago. Brazil is closer to the case of Argentina and Uruguay, with still high levels of debt <lb/>(at least in gross terms) and a somewhat slower reduction than the first group. <lb/></note>

			<body>Debt sustainability depends on a series of factors such as long-term economic growth <lb/>perspectives, the cost of funds (interest rate), and the composition of debt; but also things much <lb/>harder to measure such as expectations (Calvo, 1988) and institutional/political characteristics <lb/>affecting a country&apos;s ability and willingness to service its sovereign debt. Furthermore, <lb/>exogenous shocks to each of these variables are hard to identify, making debt sustainability <lb/>analysis a challenging topic. Therefore, in this section we explore some aspects of debt dynamics <lb/>in the region using standard techniques in the literature, rather than making a precise judgement <lb/>regarding the need and size of fiscal adjustment in each country. <lb/>Although it is not obvious how to establish a benchmark for safe debt levels, one way to <lb/>approach this issue is to compute the primary surplus required to stabilise debt to GDP ratios at <lb/>their current level, and compare this required surplus with both actual and structural balances. <lb/>Given the government budget dynamics in equation (7), fiscal policy is considered <lb/>sustainable if the primary surplus (S) is greater than the primary surplus required to stabilise the <lb/>debt level (D) relative to GDP (Y): <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>S <lb/>D <lb/>r <lb/>D <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">, <lb/>(7) <lb/>where debt levels are end-of-period and rt+1 is the average real interest rate during period t+1. <lb/>Assuming that GDP (Y) grows at a rate gt , dividing equation (7) by Yt+1 yields: <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/></note>

First, it does not say <lb/>anything regarding the initial debt-to-GDP ratio, which might be too high and therefore an <lb/>additional fiscal effort to reduce it to a safe level would be required. Second, this &apos;accounting <lb/>approach&apos; does not consider underlying correlations and endogeneity of variables. For instance, <lb/>in the presence of default risk, interest rates would increase with the debt burden and with net <lb/>financing needs if liquidity risks are also present. Growth could in turn depend negatively on the <lb/>cost of funding (r) and the debt burden (if there is a debt overhang problem, where private <lb/>investment is lower because economic agents incorporate the prospects of higher future taxes to <lb/>service the debt). <lb/>In addition, valuation effects can have very important quantitative effects, as most <lb/>countries in the region have painfully learnt during the 1980s and 1990s (debt dollarization). In <lb/>Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2010)8 <lb/>28 <lb/>© OECD 2010 <lb/>particular, swings in the real exchange rate often imply large fluctuations in the debt-to-GDP <lb/>ratio, if the fraction of dollarised debt is different from the share of tradable goods in GDP. <lb/>15 <lb/>Observe that the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio can be written as: <lb/>Y <lb/>eD <lb/>B <lb/>d <lb/>* <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>, <lb/>(10) <lb/>where e is the relative price of tradable goods in terms of one unit of output, D* is debt <lb/>denominated in tradables (dollars) and B in output units. The right-hand-side of equation (10) <lb/>can be written as: <lb/>Y <lb/>D <lb/>Y <lb/>B <lb/>φ <lb/>+ <lb/>, <lb/>(11) <lb/>with <lb/>D <lb/>eD * <lb/>= <lb/>φ <lb/>representing the share of foreign-currency denominated debt. <lb/>The valuation-corrected debt-to-GDP ratio for a given equilibrium exchange rate e ~ is: <lb/>d <lb/>Y <lb/>B <lb/>d <lb/>φ <lb/>~ <lb/>~ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>, <lb/>(12) <lb/>where <lb/>D <lb/>D <lb/>e * <lb/>~ <lb/>~ = <lb/>φ <lb/>. <lb/>Thus, under an appreciated real exchange rate ( <lb/>e <lb/>e ~ <lb/>&lt; ), the valuation-corrected debt ratio <lb/>will be greater than the observed ratio. This implies that the required primary surplus, shown in <lb/>equation (13), will also be higher, given that a depreciation of the currency vis-à-vis the dollar <lb/>would be expected in the transition to the steady state. Vice versa, if the currency is depreciated <lb/>(above the equilibrium exchange rate), the adjusted debt level will be less than the observed one. <lb/>d <lb/>r <lb/>g <lb/>r <lb/>s <lb/>~ <lb/>1 <lb/>~ <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>. <lb/>(13) <lb/>In practical terms, we measure the equilibrium real exchange rate to be measured by the <lb/>average bilateral real exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar, considering CPI prices over the <lb/>period 1990 – 2008. Furthermore, as proxy for the share of foreign currency debt in total debt, we <lb/>use data on the markets where debt was issued, assuming that all external debt is in US dollars <lb/>and all domestic debt is indexed to the domestic price level (which we assume to equal the GDP <lb/>deflator; this is the implicit assumption in equations 11 – 13). <lb/>A final adjustment refers to point in the cycle at which GDP stands, given that the debt-<lb/>to-GDP ratio would be lower during a boom (holding constant the stock of debt), such that our <lb/>preferred measure of sustainability is given by: <lb/>* <lb/>~ <lb/>1 <lb/>Y <lb/>Y <lb/>d <lb/>r <lb/>g <lb/>r <lb/>s <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>(14) <lb/>where Y * is potential output.

			<body>Before computing the required fiscal surpluses, it is useful to explore the relevance of <lb/>these adjustments. Figure 12 shows the potential importance of these adjustments from a <lb/>quantitative point of view for the case of Uruguay. Debt levels as a ratio of GDP in the late 1990s <lb/>were slightly below 30 per cent of GDP. However, when taking into account the appreciation of <lb/>the real exchange rate with respect to its long-term average, debt levels would have been ten <lb/>percentage points of GDP higher. The opposite is true for 2002, where the observed debt-to-GDP <lb/>ratio shot up to over 100 per cent of GDP, while it would have been around 76 per cent of GDP if <lb/>debt was valued at the long-term real exchange rate, and almost 16 p. p. of GDP less if it were <lb/>taken into account that the Uruguayan economy was in a deep crisis with GDP far below its <lb/>potential (almost 20 per cent, according to our estimates). Finally, regarding the large reduction <lb/>in the debt-to-GDP ratio after the crisis of more than 50 percentage points of GDP between 2002 <lb/>and 2009, our structural measure of debt was reduced by 7.7 percentage points until 2008, but <lb/>increased in 2009 to reach similar levels as in 2002. Thus, most of the reduction in the debt-to-<lb/>GDP ratio could be attributed to the rebound in economic growth and the appreciation of the <lb/>real exchange rate in the aftermath of the devaluation of the currency. <lb/>Figure 12.

			<body>III. ESTIMATION OF OUTPUT GAP <lb/>Many researchers have recognised and analysed aggregate cycles in production without <lb/>reaching consensus on its causes. 17 Lack of consensus regarding the theory is accompanied by an <lb/>empirical problem; measurement of economic cycles depends on the estimation of potential <lb/>output, which is unobservable. OECD methodology decomposes production through classical <lb/>Solow factor decomposition of capital constructed though perpetual inventory methods, labour <lb/>(hours worked) and multifactor productivity (MFP). Potential output is then constructed as the <lb/>counter-factual production arising from full capital utilisation 18 , unemployment rate equal to the <lb/>NAIRU, and MFP given by its long-run trend. <lb/>Although we follow the above criteria to construct potential output in the Latin American <lb/>countries, we could not follow OECD methodology by further disaggregating factors by their <lb/>specific types, by the sectors of the economy where they are being used, or by their rate of <lb/>utilization. In particular, restrictions on data availability for several Latin American countries <lb/>forced us to construct capital from aggregate investment figures, using the perpetual inventory <lb/>method with infinite lifespan and a constant depreciation rate of eight percent. Real investment, <lb/>real GDP and active population data are chained series <lb/>19 built from series in Penn World tables, <lb/>which cover a span of nearly six decades, from 1950 to 2007. The series are extended up to 2013 <lb/>using IMF&apos;s World Economic Outlook estimates and forecast as of April 2010. <lb/>20 The treatment of <lb/>net exports, in real terms (volume) or in terms of its purchasing power (dollars), merits also some <lb/>attention. While the first measure better reflects production dynamics, the latter better reflects <lb/>change on income. We opt for the former measure of volume on two grounds: we keep <lb/>consistency when we later decompose GDP using a production function, and we analyze the <lb/>17 This has lead economist to declare such aggregate behaviour dead in more than one occasion. The latest <lb/>notable quote came in 2003 from Robert Lucas, who in his presidential address to the American Economic <lb/>Association declared that &apos;the central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical <lb/>purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades&apos;. <lb/>18 OECD latest revision to potential output uses total capital rather than a filtered series of such series <lb/>(OECD, 2008). <lb/>19 See OECD (2001) for the benefit of chained indices with respect to other bases of conversion, especially <lb/>when looking at higher frequency data and avoiding level comparison across countries. <lb/>20 Potential output is estimated up to 2009. But forecasts for years 2010 onwards are used as a way to <lb/>circumvent well-known end point filter problems when estimating trends. GDP forecasts are provided <lb/>by the IMF, while investment forecasts are estimated from those GDP forecasts, using simple regression <lb/>of investment growth on GDP growth between 1990 and 2009. <lb/>Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2010)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>effect of terms of trade on fiscal balance separately from the effect of the business cycle. Initial <lb/>capital stock in 1950 is assumed to be on a balanced growth path, thus approximated by <lb/>K 1950 = I 1950 / [(1 + g)(1 + n) − (1 − δ)] <lb/>(15) <lb/>where I 1950 is initial investment expenditure (filtered by a linear interpolation of the log <lb/>investment throughout the 1950s), g is the average rate of technological progress on that same <lb/>decade, and n is the corresponding average growth rate of active population. <lb/>For the implicit Cobb-Douglas production function we assume a capital share of 0.5 for <lb/>all countries. This is significantly different from the standard approximation of one third, but <lb/>closer to the average obtained in the literature that covers emerging markets (see for example <lb/>Gollin, 2002 for country–specific measures of this parameter for a wide range of countries). <lb/>Given the broad level of aggregation, cyclical action will be centred in MFP. Several <lb/>statistical studies have questioned the usual Hodrick-Prescott methodology to de-trend economic <lb/>series, arguing that it is tailor-made for the output cycles in the US, but not necessarily optimal <lb/>for any other type of economic series (see Harvey et al., 2008). Furthermore, there is ample <lb/>evidence that emerging markets have a very different cyclical behaviour than industrialised <lb/>economies, with some authors putting into question even the existence of cyclical shocks <lb/>(e.g. Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007). <lb/>To address some of these challenges posed in the literature, we de-trend the resulting <lb/>MFP series using the unobserved components model suggested by Harvey (1998). We use this <lb/>state-space estimation method to estimate unexpected shocks to the MFP series, decomposing <lb/>these shocks into three components: shocks that have a permanent effect on MFP, cyclical shocks <lb/>with an estimated frequency, and time decay, and transitory &apos;white noise&apos; shocks. Permanent <lb/>shocks determine the trend while the two latter shocks determine the gap to potential output. <lb/>Harvey (1989) shows that the Hodrick-Prescott filter can be obtained as a particular case of this <lb/>method, by imposing two additional restrictions: no cyclical component and a predetermined <lb/>ratio between the variance of transitory and permanent shocks (a ratio that coincides with the <lb/>parameter lambda of HP filters). <lb/>We define the logarithm of multifactor productivity a, and use the state-space domain to <lb/>decompose the series into three unobserved components: a trend t, a cycle c, and a transitory <lb/>shock ξι : <lb/>a = t + c + ξι <lb/>(16) <lb/>The trend component accounts for permanent changes in the growth rate of (log) MFP, <lb/>and is thus interpreted as the &apos;long run trend for multi factor productivity&apos; in potential output. It <lb/>is specified as growing with a stochastic drift µ : <lb/>t = t−1 + γ ∆crisis + µ <lb/>(17) <lb/>where t−1 is the trend in the previous period and ∆crisis is a year dummy that account for large <lb/>permanent MFP losses at the beginning of the 1980s debt crisis. The drift rate µ is assumed to <lb/>follow a random walk: <lb/>µ = µ−1 + β ∆crisis +ξµ <lb/>(18) <lb/>where the same 1980s dummy ∆crisis is used to account for any large permanent reduction in <lb/>MFP&apos;s growth rates after the debt crisis. Thus, MFP trend grows at a rate that varies, but that at <lb/></body>

The large <lb/>recession in the early 1980s and the prolonged low growth that resulted call for adding the ∆crisis <lb/>dummy, which proves to be significantly negative for both the level and rate of MFP trend. As <lb/>countries felt the 1980s recession in different years (between 1981 and 1982), for each country we <lb/>select the year dummy which maximises the log likelihood (following the AIC criteria). <lb/>The cycle component c follows the autoregressive process: <lb/>c = ρ cos(λ) c−1 + ρ sin(λ) c*−1 + ξχ <lb/>(19) <lb/>c* = −ρ sin(λ) c−1 + ρ cos(λ) c*−1 + ξχ * <lb/>(20) <lb/>where ξχ and ξχ * are disturbances with equal variance. The period of the cycle is 2π /λ. The <lb/>damping factor ρ with 0 &lt; ρ &lt; 1 ensures that c is a stationary ARMA (2, 1) process with complex <lb/>roots in the autoregressive part. It is assumed that all disturbances are normally distributed and <lb/>are independent of each other (usual assumption to assure the identification of the parameters). <lb/>Initial values for the stationary cycle components are given by the unconditional distribution and <lb/>for the non-stationary trend and drift components by a diffuse prior. The filtered and smoothed <lb/>values of the unobserved components are generated by the Kalman filter. <lb/>Estimated parameters for the temporary, cyclical and trend components vary significantly <lb/>across countries. Figure 13 shows the variance decomposition of unexpected shocks in each <lb/>period (ξµ +ξχ + ξι ). While Uruguay has the largest estimated total variance, its shocks are mostly <lb/>cyclical. The figure also shows that long term estimated shocks to the trend in Chile, Costa Rica, <lb/>Peru and Uruguay have a statistically significant variance. As expected, even for these countries, <lb/>this variance is significantly smaller than the estimated variance of the two stationary shocks; a <lb/>fact that translates into a relatively smooth long-term trend. Though smaller in size than the <lb/>stationary shocks, trend shocks follow a random walk. Thus their effect is cumulative and large <lb/>after several periods. <lb/>Figure 13.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>This paper aims to contribute to the debate on fiscal policy in Latin America by <lb/>measuring cyclicality of fiscal balances using a common methodology. At the onset of the <lb/>international financial crisis in 2008-2009, many indicators suggested that Latin American <lb/>economies were facing the crisis in a much better macroeconomic position that in the past; with <lb/>positive budget surpluses, lower debt-to-GDP levels and a more credible monetary policy thanks <lb/>to inflation targeting regimes. Solid macro balances were the new reality in a region where fiscal <lb/>fragility had been at the root of past protracted crises, such as the dramatic debt crisis of the <lb/>1980s. <lb/>We track fiscal balances since the early nineties for a set of Latin American economies, <lb/>implementing both standardised cyclical-adjustment OECD methodology and regional specific <lb/>adjustments for the impact of commodity prices. These estimations allow measuring the size of <lb/>automatic stabilisers embedded in tax policies, and the cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy in <lb/>the region as a whole. Additionally, we perform debt sustainability exercises to analyse how far <lb/>from a potential benchmark current fiscal balances are. <lb/>Our main messages can be summarised as follow. First, there is a great degree of <lb/>uncertainty concerning output gap estimates in Latin America. Compounded with highly <lb/>volatile cyclical shocks, there is evidence of highly volatile trends for potential output. Second, <lb/>commodity cycles may be as relevant to countercyclical policy as economic cycles, because of the <lb/>former&apos;s significance in total fiscal revenues. Third, tax automatic stabilisers are significant, <lb/>although fairly small. Primary budget balances respond automatically around 0.2 p.p. for each <lb/>percentage point of output gap in the region, half the OECD average (although with significant <lb/>regional differences). Forth, since the early nineties, discretionary fiscal policy has been pro-<lb/>cyclical in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico and Uruguay, while neutral in Chile, Colombia <lb/>and Peru. Fifth, pro-cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy is probably explained by lack of <lb/>access to credit during deep crises, rather than by profligate spending. And sixth, from a <lb/>structural perspective, both cyclically-adjusted balances and debt sustainability analysis confirm <lb/>the better position enjoyed by most countries in the region before the crisis. <lb/>Venues for continuing research include lifting restrictions and understanding the <lb/>implications of distinguishing cyclical and trend volatility. In a first stage, some hard <lb/>assumptions we made to apply the OECD methodology may be relaxed, in particular the unitary <lb/>elasticity of consumption taxes to the cycle, and the consideration of automatic stabilization via <lb/>expenditure. Additionally, alternative data sources of the distribution of tax payers <lb/>(administrative data) may be used as a robustness check of the results. Finally, it would be <lb/>interesting to identify in the tax revenues series the effects of tax and social security reforms <lb/>implemented since 1990, and to estimate their impact on elasticities. <lb/></body>
