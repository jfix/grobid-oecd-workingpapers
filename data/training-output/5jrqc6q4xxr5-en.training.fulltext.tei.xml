			<head>ABSTRACT<lb/></head>

			<p>Ten years after the 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference agreed on a mandate to operationalise aid for<lb/> trade, this paper assesses the achievements and challenges of the WTO-led Initiative. After outlining the<lb/> achievements, the paper discusses where to put the emphasis, how to expand partnerships, how to enhance<lb/> effectiveness; and, most importantly, how to retain interest in using aid to make trade work for the poor. In<lb/> conclusion, the paper proposes that the Initiative could focus on promoting connectivity, boosting<lb/> sustainable investment, promoting green growth, and supporting the achievement of the Sustainable<lb/> Development Goals. The paper suggests that these aims can best be achieved through regional approaches<lb/> for tackling trade-related binding constraints with development finance from a combination of different<lb/> sources, including providers of South-South co-operation and with engagement of the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ten years ago, the sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization invited the Director<lb/> General to set up a task force for operationalising aid for trade with the aim of generating support for<lb/> developing countries, particularly least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity and trade-<lb/>related infrastructure they need to implement and benefit from WTO Agreements and more broadly to<lb/> expand their trade.<lb/></p>

			<p>The task force recommended using existing mechanisms for identifying and prioritising trade-related<lb/> capacity constraints around which donors should align their support. The Paris Declaration on Aid<lb/> Effectiveness was acknowledged to provide the guiding principles for the Initiative. These principles have<lb/> created a strong partnership between the trade and development communities around a shared agenda with<lb/> clear objectives and reciprocal commitments based on mutual accountability.<lb/> The WTO Global Reviews of Aid for Trade, together with the joint OECD/WTO Aid for Trade at a<lb/> Glance monitoring reports, have shown that the Initiative has raised awarness among developing countries<lb/> and donor agencies about the positive role that trade can play in promoting economic growth and<lb/> development. Moreover, developing countries, notably the least developed, are getting better at<lb/> articulating, mainstreaming and communicating their trade-related objectives and strategies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cummulative aid-for-trade disbursements reached USD 245 billion and an additional USD 190<lb/></head>

			<p>billion in other official flows since the Initiative started in 2006. Aid-for-trade commitments stood at<lb/> USD 55.4 billion in 2013, an additional USD 30 billion or 118% increase in real terms compared to the<lb/> 2002-05 baseline average. This has raised the share of aid for trade in sector-allocable aid to 38.4% in 2013<lb/> from an average 32.5% during the baseline period.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid for trade is effective at both the micro and macro level</head>

			<p>according to a broad range of trade and<lb/> development literature. More specifically, OECD research found that one dollar extra invested in aid for<lb/> trade generates nearly eight additional dollars of exports from all developing countries – and twenty dollars<lb/> for the poorest countries. Results, however, may vary considerably depending on the type of aid-for-trade<lb/> intervention, the sector at which the support is directed, the income level, and the location of the recipient<lb/> country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid-for-trade case stories buttress this</head>

			<p>evidence. The sheer quantity of activities described in these<lb/> case stories suggest that aid for trade is becoming central to development startegies and has taken root<lb/> across a wide spectrum of countries and activities. Although not always easy to atribute cause and effect,<lb/> the stories show tangible evidence of how aid for trade is helping countries build the human, institutional<lb/> and infrastructural capacities for turning trade opportunities into trade flow and helping men and women<lb/> make a more decent living.<lb/></p>

			<head>Building trade-capacities is an ongoing process.</head>

			<p>The continued need for the Aid for Trade Initiative<lb/> is obvious; tackling trade-related binding constraints requires persistent efforts in a globalising economy<lb/> where connectivity is key for success. This is especially true with trade growing at a slower pace than<lb/> before. Despite the significant achievements of the Initiative over the past ten years, challenges remain in<lb/> keeping it relevant.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The role of the private sector should be strengthened further. Much progress has already been<lb/> made</figure>

			<p>in involving the private sector, but engagement could be intensified through creating shared multi-<lb/>stakeholder value and by scaling up and systematically including the private sector in the different stages<lb/> of the aid-for-trade project cycle. Such engagement should, however, respect multilateral agreements<lb/> which discipline the potential distortion of trade flows with aid money.<lb/></p>

			<head>Engage with the providers of South-South trade-related co-operation who</head>

			<p>supply substantial<lb/> sources of assistance in Asia, Latin America, and especially in Africa. Although some are transparent<lb/> about their support, increased comparability and co-operation with DAC donors would help reduce<lb/> institutional and human capacity constraints at the local level as well as facilitate co-ordination among the<lb/> different providers of trade-related support. This would also help in creating a level playing field among<lb/> the different providers of trade-related assistance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Enhance effectiveness through regional programmes. Deepening</head>

			<p>economic integration via regional<lb/> co-operation is a key priority in the reform strategies of most developing economies. It is also actively<lb/> promoted by donors, who collectively committed USD 3.1 billion to regional priorities in 2013. These<lb/> programmes can be made even more effective by involving an honest broker to help find common ground<lb/> among countries, offering financial incentives, building human and institutional capacities, and<lb/> harmonising regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Experiment with new forms of aid delivery</head>

			<p>to enhance mutual accountability and provide<lb/> incentives for more and better aid for trade. Focussing aid-for-trade programmes on quantifiable targets,<lb/> would allow for the experimenting with results-focussed approaches, such as budget support, or payment<lb/> for performance.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Focus on connectivity and trade costs to provide an operational focal point for an action-oriented<lb/> agenda among a broad collation of stakeholders, including the providers of South-South co-operation and<lb/> the private sector. The advantages of such targets are also that they are neutral in the sense of benefiting<lb/> not just exporters, but also importers and households.<lb/> Expand the scope to sustainable investment. The initial emphasis should be on trade in services,<lb/> with a focus on those sectors that are central to promoting sustainable development, such as agriculture,<lb/> energy and transport. Donor support in this area could tackle a range of issues such as transparency.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Promote green growth. Aid for trade should support developing countries in moving to sustainable<lb/> agriculture, building climate-resilient infrastructure, strengthening the supply chain of low-carbon<lb/> technologies and environmental goods and services, and more generally helping them with achieving green<lb/> growth.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Play a catalytic role in supporting the SDGs. The SDGs highlight that &quot; (…) increasing aid-for-trade<lb/> support for developing countries, in particular the least developed (…) &quot; would help to &quot; (…) promote<lb/> sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work<lb/> for all. &quot;<lb/> The Initiative should focus on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the trade<lb/> and development landscape. In response to the changing nature of the world economy and its rising<lb/> complexity, new analytical approaches are needed to better understand the trade-offs and<lb/> complementarities between policy objectives – e.g. between growth promoting policies and equity and<lb/> environmental concerns. Addressing these concerns and dealing with these interlinkages requires<lb/> integrated approaches that breakdown silos between policy communities. The Aid for Trade Initiative<lb/> should be an integral part of this new approach to policy which is essential if we want to deliver the<lb/> Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Tenth WTO Ministerial Conference in Kenya in<lb/> December 2015 offers an opportune moment to take stock of the achievements of the Aid for Trade<lb/> Initiative and reflect on how to continue its relevance in the changing trade and development<lb/> landscape.<lb/></figure>

			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>History has shown that openness to trade is a key ingredient for economic success and raising living<lb/> standards. Countries that have pursued an outward-oriented development strategy with trade liberalisation<lb/> at its heart, have not only outperformed inward-looking economies in terms of aggregate growth rates, but<lb/> have also succeeded in lowering poverty rates and registering improvements in other indicators of social<lb/> progress. Successive rounds of multilateral trade liberalisation, increasing numbers of preferential market<lb/> access schemes and regional free trade agreements as well as expanding South-South trade have created<lb/> many more trading opportunities for developing countries.<lb/> Supply-side capacity limitations and trade-related infrastructure gaps continue to prevent some<lb/> developing countries from converting new trade opportunities into actual trade flows. Moreover, onerous<lb/> regulatory requirements together with superfluous restrictive policies increase the cost of doing business,<lb/> which weighs especially heavy on firms in developing countries. In a global economy characterised by<lb/> fragmented production chains, these costs hamper international connectivity and limit the contribution of<lb/> trade to economic growth and poverty reduction.<lb/></p>

			<head>The aid for trade partnership<lb/></head>

			<p>The Aid for Trade Initiative was launched at the 2005 Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Conference to<lb/> tackle these trade-related binding constraints and to distribute the benefits of trade more equitably across<lb/> and within developing countries. The initiative is guided by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.<lb/> Properly applied, the underlying principles lead to mutual accountability based on a shared agenda with<lb/> clear objectives and reciprocal commitments. This should create incentives for more and better aid for<lb/> trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>…build on transparency,…<lb/></head>

			<p>The WTO in collaboration with the OECD has created a monitoring framework to track progress in<lb/> implementing the Aid for Trade Initiative in order to enhance its credibility. As a tool it is best<lb/> characterised as a spotlight, not a microscope – which allows for reviewing at a global level progress made<lb/> locally and regionally. The monitoring exercise is based on self-assessments, data on aid-for-trade proxies<lb/> extracted from the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), and aid-for-trade country profiles that track<lb/> performance between development finance inputs and trade and development results. This is buttressed by<lb/> case stories on what works and what doesn&apos;t work in aid-for-trade programmes, research from international<lb/> governmental organisation, non-governmental organisations, findings from independent evaluations and<lb/> academic research.<lb/></p>

			<head>…mutual accountability...<lb/></head>

			<p>The monitoring framework which follows the logic framework underpinning the Aid for Trade<lb/> Initiative features three accountability mechanisms with the following objectives:<lb/></p>

			<figure>• At the local level, to foster local ownership and ensure that trade-related needs are prioritised in<lb/> national development strategies and adequately funded by the donor community;<lb/> • At the regional level, to focus attention on regional trade-related constraints and growth<lb/> opportunities and where needed galvanise collective action;<lb/> • At the global level, to increase transparency about what is happening at the local and regional<lb/> levels, what is not, and where improvements are needed.<lb/> Figure 1: Aid for trade logical framework<lb/> Source OECD (2006)<lb/></figure>

			<head>…adapting to changing environments.<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the operationalisation of the Aid for Trade Initiative in 2006, the trade and development<lb/> landscape has evolved considerably. The development paradigm is witnessing a shift of attention from<lb/> official development assistance to external development finance and domestic resource mobilization. More<lb/> importantly, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) encourage the transformation of natural resource-<lb/>dependent growth patterns into more inclusive and sustainable ones, while the Conference of the Parties to<lb/> the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) meeting at the end of 2015 strives for an<lb/> agreement on putting the world on track to a low-carbon, sustainable future.<lb/> Trade volumes today are growing roughly in line with GDP, compared with growth rates about twice<lb/> as fast as output over the period from the mid-1980s to 2000. This slower growth rate is not only the result<lb/> of sluggish GDP growth, but also because the relationship between trade and GDP has changed in recent<lb/> years (<ref type="biblio">Constantinescu et al, 2015</ref>). In trade policy the focus of analysis is shifting from countries to firms<lb/> and value chains; from industries to tasks and business functions; from stocks to flows; and from public to<lb/> private trade barriers.<lb/> Notwithstanding these changes in the trade and development landscape, it is clear that there is still<lb/> considerable scope to enhance the international division of labour by further integrating countries that have<lb/> heretofore remained marginally engaged in trade in general and in regional and global value chains in<lb/> particular. The Tenth WTO Ministerial Conference in Kenya offers an opportune moment to take stock of<lb/> the achievements of the Aid for Trade Initiative and reflect on how to continue its relevance in this<lb/> changing trade and development landscape.<lb/></p>

			<head>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:</head>

			<p>Section 2 looks at the achievements of the<lb/> Initiative in terms of additional official development financing for tackling trade-related binding<lb/> constraints and the results of these programmes in improving trade performance and reducing poverty.<lb/> Section 3 discusses challenges that need to be addressed to keep the Initiative relevant, inclusive and<lb/> results focused. Section 4 addresses how to expand the partnership with the private sector and with the<lb/> providers of South-South trade-related co-operation. Section 5 suggests that effectiveness could be further<lb/> improved through regional programmes and experimenting with new forms of aid delivery. Section 6<lb/> analyses how a focus on connectivity, sustainable investment, green growth and the SDG could<lb/> reinvigorate the Initiative and rekindle donor interest. Section 7 concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED?<lb/></head>

			<p>This section reviews the achievements of the Aid for Trade Initiative in terms of its stated objectives<lb/> to &quot; help developing countries, particularly LDCs, to build the supply-side capacity and trade-related<lb/> infrastructure that they need to implement and benefit from WTO Agreements and more broadly to expand<lb/> their trade. &quot; Furthermore, &quot; effective aid for trade should enhance growth prospects, reduce poverty,<lb/> complement multilateral trade reforms, and distribute the global benefits of trade more equitably across<lb/> and within developing countries &quot; (WTO, 2006).<lb/></p>

			<head>Prioritising trade …<lb/></head>

			<figure>Central to the whole Aid for Trade Initiative is the notion that trade should be (better) mainstreamed<lb/> as a priority in the strategies of developing countries and donor agencies. Most donor agencies have<lb/> reported that they have specific aid for trade strategies. Some donors such as European Commission<lb/> Germany and the United Kingdom are in the process of updating their strategies. UNDP (2011) and<lb/> Brenton et al (2014) find that while progress has been observed in mainstreaming trade in developing<lb/> countries, capacities remain uneven. The high number of countries that have actively participated in<lb/> successive monitoring exercises that underpin the biennial Global Reviews of Aid for Trade, as well as a<lb/> recent review of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies undertaken by the Executive Secretariat of the<lb/> Enhanced Integrated Framework suggest that progress in this area continues. 2<lb/></figure>

			<head>...also at the regional level…<lb/></head>

			<p>Deepening economic integration via regional economic co-operation has emerged as a priority in the<lb/> reform strategies of many developing countries. This is evidenced by the exponential growth in regional<lb/> trading arrangement in which they now participate. Such co-operation can sub-regional, regional or inter-<lb/>regional; South-South or North-South; formal or informal. Whatever the modalities, it is clear that<lb/> developing countries ae placing an increased emphasis on regional trade and investment integration. This is<lb/> also reflected in the growing number of regional <ref type="biblio">Aid</ref> for Trade strategies that have been developed such as<lb/> in 2012 by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), in 2013 by the Caribbean<lb/> Community (CARICOM), in 2013 by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in 2013<lb/> Central Africa and in the Pacific (2014). An Aid for Trade strategy for the Economic Community of West<lb/> African States (ECOWAS) is also under discussion.<lb/></figure>

			<head>…attracting more ODA …<lb/></head>

			<p>Prioritising of trade as a tool for economic growth and poverty reduction was expected to result in<lb/> securing &quot; additional, predictable, sustainable and effective financing for building trade capacities in<lb/> developing countries &quot; . To assess additionality and ensure accurate accounting at the global level, aid-for-<lb/>trade benchmarks were agreed. These include: official development assistance (ODA) and other official<lb/> flows (OOF) to help developing countries elaborate trade strategies, negotiate trade agreements and<lb/> implement their outcomes; build roads, ports and telecommunications networks to connect domestic<lb/> markets to the global economy; support the private sector, exploit their comparative advantages and<lb/> diversify their exports; help with the costs associated with trade liberalisation such as tariff reductions,<lb/> preference erosion or declining terms of trade; and, finally, other trade-related needs if identified as trade-<lb/>related priorities in partner countries&apos; national development strategies (<ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>). 3<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2: Aid for Trade CRS categories<lb/> Source OECD (2006)<lb/></figure>

			<head>…increasing disbursements, and …<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the Initiative was launched in 2006, a total of USD 246.5 billion in official development<lb/> assistance has been disbursed by bilateral and multilateral donors for financing aid-for-trade programmes<lb/> and projects. Support for programmes aimed at reducing the infrastructure gap in developing countries<lb/> received USD 128.9 billion, while programmes targeted at building productive capacities took<lb/> USD 109.6 billion. Aid for trade in its narrowest sense of support for trade policy and regulation attracted a<lb/> total of USD 7.6 billion and USD 60 million was spent on easing trade-related adjustment cost; one of the<lb/> original arguments for the Aid for Trade Initiative. To date, more than three quarters of total aid for trade<lb/> has financed projects in four sectors: transport and storage (29%), energy generation and supply (21%),<lb/> agriculture (18%) and banking and financial services (10%) (<ref type="figure">figure 3</ref>). Geographically, 146 developing<lb/> countries received aid-for-trade assistance, mainly in Asia (38.4%) and Africa (35.1%). In terms of<lb/> population, the least developed countries received USD 10 per capita in aid for trade; the highest compared<lb/> to other income groups and more than double the average aid for trade per capita.<lb/></p>

			<head>…doubling commitments …<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2013, commitments reached USD 55.4 billion, an increase of USD 1.8 billion in real terms<lb/> compared to 2012 and an additional USD 30.1 billion or 118% in real terms compared with the 2002-05<lb/> baseline average (<ref type="figure">figure 3</ref>). This increased the share of aid for trade in sector-allocable aid from an average<lb/> of 32.5% during the baseline period to 38.4% in 2013. Thus, within the expanding ODA budget envelope<lb/> the share of aid for trade has increased even more. The 5.3 basis point increase could be considered as<lb/> additional aid for trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>…also of OOF…<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition, since 2006 USD 190.8 billion in gross trade-related other official flows (OOF) has been<lb/> disbursed (<ref type="figure">figure 4</ref>). A large increase was pay out by the international finance institutions right after the<lb/> 2007/08 financial crises. Most of this non-concessional funding supported projects in economic<lb/> infrastructure (47%) and building productive capacities (52%) and almost exclusively in middle-income<lb/> countries (92%). Asia is also the main beneficiary of trade-related OOF at USD 72.5 billion, or 38% of the<lb/> total support. At USD 30.75 billion, Africa is surpassed by middle income countries in Latin America and<lb/> the Caribbean and Europe, with USD 45.9 billion and USD 38.7 billion, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4: Trade-Related gross OOF disbursements, aggregate 2002-2013<lb/> Source OECD/DAC/CRS<lb/></figure>

			<head>…building trade capacities, …<lb/></head>

			<p>The significant amount of ODA and OOF spent to support developing countries building their trade<lb/> capacities through improving infrastructure, invigorating the private sector and streamlining their trade<lb/> policies should show results. Empirical literature confirms that aid for trade, in general, is effective at both<lb/> the micro and macro level (<ref type="biblio">Velde te et al, 2013</ref>). The impacts, however, may vary considerably depending<lb/> on the type of aid-for-trade intervention, the income level, the sector at which the support is directed and<lb/> geographical region of the recipient country. For example, <ref type="biblio">Ferro et al. (2012)</ref> found that a 10% increase in<lb/> aid to transportation, information, communication and technology, energy, and banking services is<lb/> associated with increases of 2.0%, 0.3%, 6.8% and 4.7% respectively in the exports of manufactured goods<lb/> from the recipient countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>…lowering trade costs, …<lb/></head>

			<p>Aid for trade also has great potential to reduce trade costs. Cali and te <ref type="biblio">Velde (2011)</ref> examined the<lb/> impact of aid for trade on trade costs and exports and found that a USD 1 million increase in aid-for-trade<lb/> facilitation is associated with a 6% reduction in the cost of packing, loading and shipping to the transit hub.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Busse et al (2012)</ref>, using panel data for 99 developing countries for the period 2004-09, show that aid for<lb/> trade is closely associated with lowering trade costs and therefore may play an important role in helping<lb/> developing countries benefit from trade. <ref type="biblio">Cirera and Winters (2015)</ref> find a positive impact on exporting and<lb/> importing times, but factors other than aid for trade explain different experiences of structural change in<lb/> sub-Saharan African countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>…increasing trade, and…<lb/></head>

			<p>Helbe et al. (2012) empirically assess the relationship between different aid-for-trade categories and<lb/> trade performance. They find that a 1% increase in aid for trade facilitation could generate a<lb/> USD 415 million increase in global trade. An evaluation of USAID (2010) trade assistance that focused on<lb/> export expansion, trade policy reforms, increased participation in trade agreements, and efficiency gains<lb/> from trade facilitation assistance, finds that each additional one US dollar increases the value of developing<lb/> country exports by USD 42 two years later. OECD/WTO (2013a) finds that one US dollar invested in aid<lb/> for trade is on average associated with an increase of nearly eight US dollars in exports from all developing<lb/> countries and an increase of twenty US dollars in exports from the poorest countries. These effects were<lb/> found to be even higher for exports of parts and components.<lb/></p>

			<head>…reducing poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>Martuscelli and Winters (2014) on the basis of a literature review conclude that trade liberalisation<lb/> generally boosts income and thus reduces poverty, with working in the export sector predicting gains and<lb/> in the import-competing sector losses. A fairly common finding is that female workers gain from trade<lb/> liberalisation. De <ref type="biblio">Melo and Wagner (2014)</ref> confirm these findings and show that aid for trade has also<lb/> helped reduce poverty through other channels. For example, targeted aid to building productive capacities<lb/> in agriculture and insurance schemes to remove risks can raise the productivity of households close to the<lb/> poverty line. Road rehabilitation can also reduce the monopsonistic power of traders in remote areas,<lb/> thereby raising the incomes of the poor selling agricultural products.<lb/></p>

			<p>These empirical findings are illustrated by the results reported in the 111 case stories that the public<lb/> and the private sector submitted in the context of the 2015 OECD/WTO monitoring exercise (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The case stories about aid-for-trade priorities, policies and programmes mention 299 results. The most<lb/> important ones are export market diversification (47 times), an increase in employment, including for<lb/> women (45 and 27 times, respectively), an increase in foreign and domestic investment (37 and 33 times,<lb/> respectively). These results are closely followed by a reported rise in per capita income (25 times) and<lb/> poverty reduction (18 times). The findings are rather similar to those reported in the 2011 exercise.<lb/> However, any conclusion from the collection of case stories must be tempered by the awareness of its<lb/> selection biases (OECD/WTO<ref type="biblio">, 2014; Newfarmer, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>REMAINING CHALLENGES<lb/></head>

			<p>The continued need for the Aid for Trade Initiative is obvious; tackling trade-related binding<lb/> constraints is ongoing process that gains in urgency in a world in which connectivity is essential for<lb/> economic success. To continue to ensure that the Initiative remains relevant, there are continued questions<lb/> that warrant consideration about what the sector and country focus should be and how best to share<lb/> knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<head>Which focus?<lb/></head>

			<p>The question of the appropriate focus of the Aid for Trade Initiative has never been conclusively<lb/> settled, as is evident from the views summarised above. At first sight, an economically rational definition<lb/> of aid for trade would be based on trade competitiveness. This competitiveness is determined by two main<lb/> factors: (i) domestic productivity as expressed though production and trade costs, which set the cost of<lb/> moving goods and services and (ii) the level of effective market access, which is a function of unilateral,<lb/> preferential, regional or multilateral trade reforms and the capacity to meet standards and overcome<lb/> information gaps regarding export markets. Unfortunately, however, this type of definition does not<lb/> differentiate between an aid-for-trade agenda on the one hand and the agenda for economic development<lb/> on the other (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006</ref>). The Task Force on Aid for Trade bypassed this problem and defined aid for<lb/> trade as those trade-related programmes and projects that are prioritised in national development strategies<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">WTO, 2006</ref>). In practise, few countries have the capacity to report on the official financial support they<lb/> receive for their trade-related priorities. At the global level this inability has resulted in equating the CRS<lb/> proxies used for assessing additionality with the definition of aid for trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>Which countries?<lb/></head>

			<p>Gamberoni and Newfarmer (2014) developed a methodology to identify empirically the potential aid-<lb/>for-trade needs of countries. They find that aid-for-trade commitments as a share of GDP are larger in<lb/> recipient countries with greater needs, although the match is not perfect. The World Economic Forum<lb/> (2015) analysed the distribution of aid-for-trade disbursements against countries&apos; score on the WEF<lb/> Enabling Trade Index (ETI) and find that disbursements have largely been aligned with developing<lb/> countries&apos; needs. Those countries which score relatively worse in the ETI generally received<lb/> proportionately more aid since the start of the Aid for Trade Initiative (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). There are exceptions,<lb/> especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where some economies have so far received relatively few resources in<lb/> light of their needs. Gamberoni and Newfarmer suggest that this might be due to other pressing<lb/> development priorities that require external development finance, or to the fact that the constraints do not<lb/> demand much money to resolve.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6: Enabling Trade Index (2010) compared to average (2005–12) AfT disbursements as share of GDP<lb/> Source WEF/ETI – OECD/CRS<lb/></figure>

			<head>Which constraints?<lb/></head>

			<p>Developing countries face numerous and multifaceted constraints preventing them from turning trade<lb/> opportunities into trade expansion and subsequent growth response. With limited political capital and finite<lb/> aid-for-trade resources, reforms need to focus on the most binding constraints. These constraints differ,<lb/> although commonality do exist at the aggregate level among countries groupings such as land-locked, or<lb/> small and vulnerable. Country specific trade-related binding constraints can be identified through a variety<lb/> of analytical tools, such as, differential diagnostics, growth diagnostic, value chain analysis, stakeholder<lb/> consultation or through a combination of them. This is being done in the Diagnostics Trade Integration<lb/> Studies that the Enhanced integrated Framework undertakes in the Least Developed Countries. To<lb/> maximise the development benefits of trade-led growth close attention should be paid to different<lb/> transmission channels and the impact of trade in terms of employment (export-orientated or import-<lb/>competing), sector (manufacture – services), geography (both rural and urban poor) and gender (both poor<lb/> women and men). Finally, for trade to promote growth and for the poor to benefit, complementary policies<lb/> are essential to facilitate their adjustment (OECD, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>How to share knowledge?<lb/></head>

			<p>Building on progress to date, Hoekman (2010) suggests creating a new aid-for-trade public-private<lb/> partnership to leverage the dynamism in the private sector for strengthening trade capacity. In addition, he<lb/> suggests launching a G-20 global initiative to provide dedicated financial support for collecting cross-<lb/>country datasets to allow for more effective monitoring and evaluation of aid for trade. <ref type="biblio">Cadot et al (2011)<lb/></ref> also took up the issue of better monitoring and evaluating and advocate that rising demands for results and<lb/> accountability from donors and clients alike require that aid-for-trade evaluations need more ambition and<lb/> rigour. Following the 2013 Agreement on Trade Facilitation, Hallaert (2013) proposes to narrow the scope<lb/> of the Initiative to only trade policy and regulations and complement it with independent and robust impact<lb/> evaluations and research hosted by the World Bank or others. OECD (2013a) proposes an alternative<lb/> between traditional ex post evaluations and costly impact assessments. Such a management tool would help<lb/> focussing aid-for-trade programmes on quantifiable objectives and measuring trade-related and<lb/> development performance on the basis of a limited set of indicators that are mutually agreed between<lb/> developing countries and donors.<lb/></p>

For example, the<lb/> International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) and the South Asia Watch on<lb/> Trade, Economics &amp; Environment (SAWTEE) (2013) conclude on the basis of case studies in eight<lb/> developing countries, including four LDCs (Bangladesh, Cambodia</table>

			<p>, Malawi, and Nepal), three LMICs<lb/> (Ghana, Guatemala, and the Philippines) and one UMIC (Peru) that aid for trade is effective under the right<lb/> conditions. However, often these conditions are lacking, despite them being the focus of aid-for-trade<lb/> programmes. Overall, they suggest that their findings do not radically differ from what has emerged from<lb/> the more general aid effectiveness debate. In that respect, aid for trade is no exception and might actually<lb/> have done slightly better in those countries than other areas that are financed with ODA. The next section<lb/> suggests that further improvements might be obtained through regional programmes and through<lb/> experiments with new forms of aid delivery.<lb/></p>

			<head>…through regional programmes, and...<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the relatively small market size in many developing countries, it is clear that sustained economic<lb/> growth needs to rely in part on creating larger, more viable markets through the rule-based sharing of<lb/> resources and production assets. Deepening economic integration via regional co-operation has thus<lb/> emerged as a key priority in the reform strategies of most developing economies, even if with differing<lb/> degrees of political commitment. Regional aid for trade is contributing to this integration process with<lb/> commitments almost tripling from an average of USD 1.2 billion during the 2002-05 baseline to<lb/> USD 3.1 billion in 2013, although its share remains still only 5.5% of total aid for trade.<lb/> Regional aid for trade is hampered by many practical complications, from technical standards to<lb/> financing issues, while negotiations can be bogged down by poor inter-governmental communications and<lb/> sometimes by lack of trust across negotiating parties (OECD, 2014b). In fact, regional aid for trade is still<lb/> insufficiently understood and appreciated in national line ministries and among stakeholders including<lb/> among donors. Moreover, implementing regional strategies is complicated by problems such as<lb/> membership of overlapping regional organisations; lack of implementation of regional agreements; poor<lb/> articulation of regional priorities within national strategies; and national and regional capacity constraints.<lb/> This creates major complications in terms of ownership, mainstreaming and aligning national strategies<lb/> around regional aid-for-trade priorities.<lb/> New approaches have emerged including multi-donor programmes such as TradeMark East Africa, 4<lb/> or regional initiatives such as USAID African Trade Hubs 5 to address these problems. These approaches<lb/> are based around trade and transport corridors and hubs, with active outreach to public and private<lb/> investors. In addition, challenges surrounding regional programmes can be tackled through the following<lb/> approaches:<lb/> • involve an &apos;honest broker&apos; such as Regional Development Banks which offer institutional<lb/> mechanisms to better co-ordinate regional and sub-regional programmes among countries;<lb/> • offer financial incentives such as a higher concessionality level for financing regional<lb/> programmes than for purely national programmes;<lb/> • build institutional and human capacities to respond to a wide variety of technical assistance<lb/> needs covering a range of disciplines, including trade policy, customs, transport, and enterprise<lb/> development;<lb/> • harmonise regulations, which makes it both a challenge as well as an opportunity to increasing<lb/> the potential to boost regional integration.<lb/></p>

			<head>…experimenting with new forms of aid delivery.<lb/></head>

			<p>A proliferation of new approaches, such as &quot; payments for performance &quot; , &quot; output-based aid &quot; , or<lb/> &quot; results-based financing &quot; are advocated as more effective than traditional forms of aid delivery.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Ramanchandran et al (2014)</ref> highlights that these forms of results-based management are promoted for a<lb/> variety of reasons based on different theories of how linking disbursements to results will ensure more<lb/> effective programs: by appealing to governments&apos; pecuniary interests to shift domestic priorities; by<lb/> drawing the attention of politicians and managers to results; by establishing accountability to constituents;<lb/> and by giving recipients discretion to engage in local problem-solving.<lb/></p>

			<p>Most budget support programmes try to create a partnership in sharing responsibility between funders<lb/> and recipients. Such a partnership should create opportunities for policy dialogue, mutual accountability<lb/> with reference to performance and provision of funds that feed into and improve the receiving countries<lb/> own financial, budgeting, and implementation capacities Savedoff (2011). One example is the Millennium<lb/> Challenge Corporation (MCC), a U.S. development program that applies the principle of country<lb/> selectivity to its programs. 6<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the MCC model, the Centre for Global Development proposes a &quot; Doing Business Facility &quot; ,<lb/> which would determine a country&apos;s eligibility for technical and financial assistance on the basis of third-<lb/>party measurements of its performance in addressing business-sector constraints. The facility would use<lb/> performance-based filters to identify a few reforming countries each year and then implement program<lb/> agreements to reinforce and advance further reforms to the business climate. The facility would both target<lb/> assistance on countries that will use it well and create reform incentives for thresholds countries (CGD,<lb/> 2010).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Ramachandran (2014)</ref> proposes &quot; Service Performance Guarantees &quot; as an extension of results-based<lb/> aid, but one that provides a different pattern of accountability – of a &quot; partnership &quot; of donors and recipient<lb/> governments towards the private sector. This is in contrast to conventional results-based aid approaches<lb/> that condition disbursement of donors&apos; funds to recipient governments on the achievement of service<lb/> outputs or outcomes without a direct link to the ultimate clients for the services. The Guarantees would<lb/> instead pay private firms when commitments – for example to reform regulation or improve infrastructure<lb/> – were not met. Such a scheme would raise many political and legal questions, but might offer an<lb/> innovative approach to improve the business climate.<lb/> Focussing the Aid for Trade Initiative more on reducing trade costs would allow for the introduction<lb/> of these results-focussed approaches. However, it is questionable whether partner countries would<lb/> welcome accountability programmes that condition the availability of aid for trade on their quantifiable<lb/> progress towards trade cost reduction. Developing country support for accountability programmes would<lb/> certainly be higher if the focus were on an assessment of donor performance. For instance, Rwanda has<lb/> introduced this kind of assessment with the aim of raising incomes to a level in 2020 where aid is no longer<lb/> necessary (OECD, 2013a).<lb/></p>

			<head>EXPANDING PARTNERSHIPS<lb/></head>

			<p>The Aid for Trade Initiative has succeeded in creating a fact-based dialogue among the trade and<lb/> development community on how to best use aid to make trade work for development. This discussion has<lb/> been especially fruitful among officials from bilateral and multilateral donors and trade negotiators who<lb/> meet regularly in the WTO Committee on Trade and Development. Involving the private sector (both in<lb/> developing and developed countries) has been more challenging, although much has already been<lb/> achieved. The same holds true for the increasing importance of the providers of South-South trade-related<lb/> capacity building programmes. The next section will discuss how to expand these partnerships further.<lb/></p>

			<head>With the private sector, and…<lb/></head>

			<p>The pivotal role of the private sector has always been recognised in the Aid for Trade Initiative<lb/> and considerable progress has been made. For instance, the International Trade Centre has reached out to<lb/> small and medium sized enterprises in developing countries. The International Chamber of Commerce<lb/> (ICC) has solicited views from their constituencies on the binding trade-related constraints they are facing<lb/> in trying to connect local firms to their value chains. The World Economic Forum has used its research<lb/> findings to benchmark bottlenecks in trade expansion and on that basis engaged its members in the aid-for-<lb/>trade dialogue. Furthermore, in recognition of the important role of the private sector, a number of<lb/> government donors, together with the ICC, the WEF, and the Centre for International Private Enterprise<lb/> (CIPE), have establish the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation — an international public-private sector<lb/> coalition designed to streamline border management in developing countries as part of the implementation<lb/> of the new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement..<lb/> In addition, a new generation of programmes is emerging, involving donors, partner countries, and<lb/> private firms in both developing and donor countries. The results of these programmes have been judged as<lb/> largely positive: they have helped firms develop new products, increase their exports and save costs. In<lb/> addition, the results are aligned with the objectives of the development community, such as: improved<lb/> workers&apos; skills, better working conditions, improved health among workers, job creation, poverty<lb/> alleviation, and improved environmental performance. Consumers have also benefitted from lower prices.<lb/> The main drivers of the engagement in donor countries are company-based and relate to firms&apos; core<lb/> business strategies, while the corporate social responsibility agenda of firms also explains their actions in<lb/> this area (OECD/WTO, 2015).<lb/> Strengthening private sector engagement further could be achieved by creating shared multi-<lb/>stakeholder value and building platforms for project-based collaboration. Such reinforced partnership<lb/> could be forged by scaling up and systematically including the private sector in the four different stages of<lb/> the aid-for-trade project life cycle (<ref type="figure">figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>to alleviate binding trade-related constraints, where the views of the<lb/> private sector could be solicited to provide information about obstacles to be removed or<lb/> incentives to be improved;<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7: Public private partnerships for managing trade related programmes<lb/> Expanding the partnership with the private sector should respect a number of international agreements<lb/> which discipline the potential distortion of trade flows with aid money. Thus, involving the private sector<lb/> in donor programmes should not reintroduce the bad practice of tying aid to donor companies. The OECD<lb/> Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits offers an extensive framework for the orderly use of<lb/> officially supported export credits, while the 2001 DAC Recommendation unties ODA to the LDCs and<lb/> HPICs. 7 The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures contains binding disciplines for<lb/> the use of subsidies. 8<lb/></figure>

			<head>…providers of South-South co-operation<lb/></head>

			<p>The contribution of South-South co-operation is an important characteristic of the Aid for Trade<lb/> Initiative. South-South providers have become substantial sources of financial assistance in Asia, Latin<lb/> America, and especially in Africa. China and India are two of the leaders in this field (<ref type="table">table 1</ref>). Typically,<lb/> they combine investment and enhanced market access opportunities with delivering expertise and financial<lb/> support to foster the economic and social welfare of other developing countries (<ref type="biblio">Zimmermann and Smith,<lb/> 2011</ref>). In addition, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), launched in Beijing in October 2014<lb/> and expected to be operational at the end of 2015, aims to provide finance for infrastructure projects in the<lb/> Asia Region, together with the Silk Road Fund and the planned BRICS bank.<lb/></p>

			<p>The availability of large additional flows of external development finance beyond ODA and OOF<lb/> would seem to raise an issue of co-ordination in some developing countries. However, three case studies<lb/> covering Ghana, Senegal and Timor-Leste OECD (2014a) find that strengthening co-ordination<lb/> mechanisms is not a high priority for any of the three governments. They generally prefer bilateral<lb/> channels of dialogue and negotiations. While some providers of South-South co-operation submit aid-for-<lb/>trade self-assessments in the context of the Global Review on Aid for Trade, additional transparency and<lb/> increased comparability of support efforts would help reduce institutional and human capacity constraints<lb/> at the local level as well as facilitate co-ordination among different providers of development finance for<lb/> trade. It would also facilitate enhancing the role of North-South, South-South and triangular regional and<lb/> international co-operation in providing access to science, technology and innovation, as suggested by the<lb/> SDG.<lb/></p>

			<head>BREAKING DOWN SILOS<lb/></head>

			<p>Notwithstanding the tangible achievements of the Initiative, interest in trade as a tool for development<lb/> appears to be waning in some quarters of the donor community. Although others, such as Australia most<lb/> recently, have announced making aid for trade a central tenet of their development programme.<lb/> Nevertheless, the donor narrative is moving towards domestic resource mobilisation, the promotion of<lb/> foreign direct investment and private sector development and engagement. These are important objectives<lb/> in their own right, but their contribution to development will remain suboptimal if they are pursued in<lb/> isolation from or even instead of promoting international trade. In fact, foreign trade remains in many cases<lb/> the single most important source of external development finance, particularly to small developing<lb/> countries and LDCs.<lb/> Part of the reason for the diminishing interest among some donors in trade as an engine of economic<lb/> growth and development seems to be linked to the continued stalemate in the negotiations on the Doha<lb/> Development Agenda and the related trend towards mega-regional trade negotiations (which largely<lb/> exclude the LDCs). However, when trade agreements are concluded, the donor community does re-engage<lb/> forcefully. For example, developing countries report that trade-related assistance is forthcoming as one of<lb/> the outcomes of preferential trading arrangements, such as the Economic Partnership Agreements.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Furthermore, donors support for Trade Facilitation surged after the 2013 Bali Agreement to<lb/> USD 680 million; an eight-fold increase compared to the average 2002-05 baseline.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Refocussing the Aid for Trade Initiative on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the trade<lb/> and development landscape should reinvigorate donor interest. In response to the changing nature of the<lb/> world economy, its rising complexity, and its shifting patterns of trade and investment flows, new<lb/> analytical approaches are needed to better understand the trade-offs and complementarities between policy<lb/> objectives – e.g. between growth promoting policies and equity and environmental concerns (OECD,<lb/> 2015a). Addressing these concerns and dealing with these interlinkages requires integrated approaches that<lb/> breakdown silos between policy communities (<ref type="biblio">Tett, 2015</ref>). The next section suggests that the Initiative<lb/> might benefit from a more integrated approach to pressing trade and development challenges such as<lb/> improving connectivity, boosting sustainable investment, promoting green growth, and contributing to the<lb/> Sustainable Development Goals.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improve connectivity<lb/></head>

			<p>The premise of the Aid for Trade Initiative is that enshrining market access in trade agreements is an<lb/> essential, but not a sufficient step to achieve market presence – other factors need to be addressed too. Past<lb/> Global Reviews have sought to galvanise attention and action on these binding constraints. The<lb/> OECD/WTO Aid for Trade at a <ref type="biblio">Glance (2015)</ref> underlines that this strategy is working, but that high trade<lb/> costs remain a significant impediment for developing countries. In the worst cases, prohibitive trade costs<lb/> effectively price the poorest countries out of regional and global markets altogether, leaving them locked<lb/> into low-value regional trade where growth possibilities are stymied. At the factory or farm-gate level,<lb/> products can be competitively priced but still fail in export markets due to excessive trade costs. High trade<lb/> costs also erode consumer welfare, narrowing the range of good and services on offer and pushing up<lb/> prices. While trade costs alone do not fully explain the development pathways of economies, they are a<lb/> major factor in clarifying why some countries are unable to grow and diversify. The same holds also true<lb/> for many regions, often disadvantaged, within countries.<lb/> Distance is a key determinant of trade costs and a major constraint for exporters. F0r instance, in the<lb/> Pacific region the weighted average distance from major markets is some 11 500 kilometres. Asian<lb/> Development Bank research (2015) on exporters in the Pacific finds that e-commerce substantially reduces<lb/> the physical distance between buyers and sellers. Accelerating the spread of e-commerce through an &quot; Aid<lb/> for eTrade &quot; initiative has been suggested as a way to reduce trade costs and connect SMEs to global<lb/> markets (<ref type="biblio">Suominen, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Embedding a trade connectivity and trade cost perspective at the centre of the Aid for Trade Initiative<lb/> would provide an operational focal point for action among a broad collation of stakeholders, including the<lb/> providers of South-South co-operation and the private sector. The advantages of trade connectivity and<lb/> trade cost reduction targets are that they are neutral in the sense of benefiting not just exporters, but also<lb/> importers and households (<ref type="biblio">Hoekman, 2014</ref>). Such a focus would also allow for a critical assessment of the<lb/> domestic regulatory framework which often stifles growth of the service sector.<lb/> It should be left to governments in dialogue with stakeholders to identify which costs are most<lb/> distorting, how best to reduce them, and how to use and mix the varied forms of development finance<lb/> available from different providers. Such an action-focused approach would strengthen the accountability<lb/> for outcomes and even allow for the introduction of innovative donor approaches such as cash-on-delivery<lb/> and other forms of impact programming.<lb/></p>

			<head>Boost sustainable investment<lb/></head>

			<p>As highlighted above, value chains have become a dominant feature of the world economy, involving<lb/> countries at all levels of development, from the poorest to the most advanced. The production of goods and<lb/> services is increasingly carried out wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive<lb/> cost and quality. This growing fragmentation of production across borders has important implications for<lb/> trade and investment patterns and offers new prospects for growth, development and jobs. In today&apos;s more<lb/> interconnected world both the costs of trade and investment protectionism and the benefits of multilateral<lb/> opening are much higher than previously thought (OECD/WTO/UNCTAD, 2013).<lb/> The Aid for Trade Initiative and the Trade Facilitation Agreement address the trade side of the<lb/> equation. <ref type="biblio">Sauvant et al. (2015)</ref> argue that the creation of sustainable investment facilitation could address<lb/> the other side. Such a programme could tackle a range of issues such as transparency and donor support for<lb/> capacity building in developing countries and in particular the LDCs (i.e. aid for investment). ). Looking<lb/> ahead, one option for the Aid for Trade Initiative would be to increase focus on the links between trade and<lb/> investment. It would build on the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, with transactions falling<lb/> under Mode 3 (i.e. commercial presence) accounting for nearly two-thirds of the world&apos;s FDI stock role.<lb/> The initial emphasis could thus be on investment in services, with a focus on those sectors that are central<lb/> to promoting sustainable development.<lb/></p>

			<head>Promote green growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Green growth offers developing countries ways to boost development and help reduce poverty in the<lb/> short term while preserving natural assets and raising the potential for economic growth over the long term<lb/> (OECD, 2013b). Aid for trade could play a catalytic role in promoting green growth. An important synergy<lb/> between aid for trade and green growth programmes is the focus on reducing trade and transport costs.<lb/> Increasing efficient use of resources in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves<lb/> competitiveness. Another possible avenue to assist the transition to green growth is through aid-for-trade<lb/> programmes that support trade in environmental goods and services, the development of green<lb/> infrastructure (such as sustainable transport systems, efficient logistics etc.) and strengthen supply chains<lb/> for low carbon technologies. By strengthening economic resilience and supply side capacity of LDCs, aid<lb/> for trade programs also contribute to these countries capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change.<lb/> The WTO Task Force recognised sustainable development as a guiding principle of aid for trade. It<lb/> recommended that donors strengthen the application of environmental impact assessments as a way of<lb/> safeguarding against possible negative environmental impacts of aid for trade projects. Common<lb/> approaches for &quot; strategic environmental assessment &quot; at the sector and national levels will also help to<lb/> mainstream environmental considerations across aid for trade policies and programs. <ref type="biblio">Keane et al (2009)<lb/></ref> also make the point that, while donors are increasing resources to climate change mitigation and<lb/> adaptation, there need to be standardised checks to ensure compatibility between these programmes and aid<lb/> for trade. Indeed, there is much scope for aid for trade and new sources of climate change finance to work<lb/> together to help meet some of the expected costs of climate change.<lb/></p>

			<head>Contribute to delivering the SDGs<lb/></head>

			<p>The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) urges the world to transform its natural resource-<lb/>dependent growth pattern to a more inclusive and sustainable one. Trade is an essential means of<lb/> implementation of the sustainable development agenda and aid for trade can play a catalytic role in<lb/> supporting the SDG (Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 2015). Aid for trade is also part of SDG 8 to &quot; Promote<lb/> sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work<lb/> for all &quot; with the objective to &quot; increase aid-for-trade support for developing countries, in particular least<lb/> developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical<lb/> Assistance to Least Developed Countries &quot; (<ref type="biblio">United Nations, 2015</ref>). Aid for trade shares many of the<lb/> objectives of the SDGs and if used in a complementary and reinforcing manner, may help build the<lb/> economic resilience and supply-side capacity LDCs need to adapt and mitigate climate change and link to<lb/> the world economy on better terms (<ref type="biblio">Ancharaz and Sultan, 2010</ref>). Aid for trade can help developing<lb/> countries build the capacities that in turn can contribute to a healthier environment and to fighting poverty.<lb/> The Sustainable Development Agenda requires a significantly increased amount of financing. This<lb/> will strengthen the prominence of international trade as a source of financing for development, particularly<lb/> for the LDCs. However, the trade and development community should take care that the transformative<lb/> nature of the Post-2015 Development Agenda does not inadvertently give rise to unnecessary non-tariff<lb/> measures that would reduce the capacity of developing countries to use trade as an engine of economic<lb/> growth and poverty reduction. This requires a more integrated approach to ensure that aid for trade<lb/> contributes to inclusive and sustainable development outcomes. That is, in addition to improving trade<lb/> performance, the Initiative should aim more explicitly at positive social, economic and environmental<lb/> impacts.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Much has changed in the trade and development landscape since the Aid for Trade Initiative was<lb/> created ten years ago. Trade and investment flows are increasingly driven by the fragmentation of the<lb/> production process. This offers opportunities for developing countries, but also highlights the need for an<lb/> open, predictable and transparent trade and investment regime. Meanwhile, the development landscape has<lb/> seen the rise of many more providers of South-South co-operation which are giving new impetus to trade-<lb/>promoting development assistance.<lb/></p>

			<p>The spread of global value chains, the increasing importance of knowledge-based capital and the rise<lb/> of the digital economy are ushering in the &quot; next production revolution &quot; (OECD, 2015b). Countries, rich<lb/> and poor need to seize this opportunity to harness innovation to boost economic growth and spur job<lb/> creation. It is uncertain however what rise of robotics, 3D printing and reducing carbon foot prints will<lb/> mean for the way in which production and trade are organised -whether they will lead to near-sourcing or<lb/> further dispersion of value chains (<ref type="biblio">Lipson and Kurman, 2013</ref>). What is certain is that the trade and<lb/> development community need to consider urgently how possible science and technology-driven<lb/> developments will change the role that trade and investment play in development strategies and in the<lb/> achievement of the SDGs.<lb/> The Aid for Trade Initiative has achieved much since its inception in 2006. The Initiative has<lb/> succeeded in rekindling awareness among developing countries and donor agencies about the positive role<lb/> that trade can play in promoting economic growth and development. Developing countries are getting<lb/> better at articulating, mainstreaming and communicating their trade-related objectives and strategies. In<lb/> turn, this has had a positive impact on the alignment of donor support with aid for trade flows steadily<lb/> growing since 2005.<lb/> Econometric analysis suggests that aid for trade is broadly associated with improvements in trade<lb/> performance, which in turn is related to reductions in poverty. These effects are confirmed by a growing<lb/> number of studies, using different methods, which yield a strong narrative about the positive impact of aid-<lb/>for-trade programmes. The delivery of aid for trade has been largely effective, but more could be done<lb/> especially through regional approaches, while experimenting with new forms of aid delivery could<lb/> strengthen accountability between donors and partners and help with improving results.<lb/> The success of the Initiative is attributed to the strong partnerships it has formed between the trade<lb/> and development communities. It has brought together various groups of stakeholders, particularly,<lb/> developing countries and donors, with the common aim to make trade work for development. Partnerships<lb/> with the private sector and the providers of South-South co-operation could be strengthened further.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The Initiative has been flexible enough to adapt to the changing trade and development landscape as<lb/> witness by the focus of successive Aid for Trade at a Glance reports on Maintaining Momentum<lb/> (OECD/WTO, 2009), Showing Results (OECD/WTO, 2011), Connecting to Value Chains (OECD/WTO,<lb/> 2013) and most recently Reducing Trade Costs (OECD/WTO, <ref type="biblio">2015</ref>). Highlighting the pivotal role of trade<lb/> for economic growth and poverty reduction remains important, but the Initiative could give more emphasis<lb/> on the need to improve connectivity, boost investment, promote green growth, and play a central role in<lb/> delivering the SDGs.</p>
