			<body>Education Indicators In Focus – 2012/03 (March) © OECD 2012 <lb/>EDUCATION <lb/>INDICATORS <lb/>FOCUS <lb/>How are girls doing in school – and women doing <lb/>in employment – around the world? <lb/>Throughout the world, girls are outperforming boys in reading… <lb/>… and women are in the majority among entrants to higher education. <lb/>As the world marks the achievements of women this month, the progress of girls and young women in <lb/>education – and of women in employment – can&apos;t be denied. In recent years, the achievement gap between <lb/>boys and girls in school has narrowed in key subjects – so much that in some areas, the focus of concern is <lb/>now on the underachievement of boys. For example, on the 2009 PISA reading assessment, 15-year-old girls <lb/>outperformed boys in every OECD country, and on average by 39 points – the equivalent of one year of school. <lb/>On the 2009 PISA mathematics assessment, 15-year-old boys tend to perform slightly better than girls in most <lb/>countries, while in science, patterns of performance related to gender are less pronounced. <lb/>On the 2009 PISA reading assessment, girls outperformed boys in every country, and on average <lb/>by 39 score points – the equivalent of one year of schooling. By contrast, boys tend to outperform <lb/>girls in mathematics. <lb/>An estimated 66% of young women in OECD countries are expected to enter a university <lb/>programme during their lifetime, compared to 52% of young men. <lb/>Men are more likely than women to hold advanced research qualifications, and 74% of all graduates <lb/>in the fields of engineering, manufacturing and construction are men. <lb/>Higher (tertiary) education improves job prospects for both men and women, and the gender <lb/>gap in employment narrows at the highest levels of educational attainment. <lb/>The better girls and boys do in school, the more likely they are to continue in education. Between 2000 and <lb/>2009, the likelihood that both young men and women will enter a university (tertiary-type A) programme <lb/>increased dramatically, from 47% to 59%. However, when these results are broken down by gender, it&apos;s <lb/>clear that women are driving these increases. For instance, the proportion of women who are expected <lb/>to enter a university programme rose from 51% in 2000 to 66% in 2009, while the proportion of men <lb/>who are expected to enter these programmes rose from 42% in 2000 to 52% in 2009. <lb/>Across OECD countries, the proportion of women who hold a university-level qualification now <lb/>equals or exceeds that of men in 29 of the 32 countries for which data are comparable. On average, <lb/>59% of all graduates who held a first university degree in 2009 are women; this proportion is <lb/>below 50% only in China, Japan, Korea and Turkey. <lb/>education data education evidence education policy education analysis education statistics <lb/>© OECD 2012 Education Indicators In Focus – 2012/03 (March) <lb/></body>

			<body>EDUCATION INDICATORS IN FOCUS <lb/>However, men are more likely than women to earn a doctorate… <lb/>Women&apos;s gains in education are helping to narrow the gender gap in employment <lb/>in many countries… <lb/>… and women are under-represented in some fields of education. <lb/>At the same time, women remain under-represented at the very highest levels of education. In 2009, 54% of <lb/>advanced research qualifications such as doctorates were awarded to men, on average across OECD countries. <lb/>This pattern is visible in all countries except Brazil, Finland, Iceland, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal and the United <lb/>States, where women now earn the majority of advanced qualifications. In Japan and Korea, only about 30% <lb/>of advanced research qualifications are awarded to women. <lb/>80 <lb/>70 <lb/>60 <lb/>50 <lb/>40 <lb/>30 <lb/>20 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>% <lb/>Percentage of university-level qualiications awarded to women (2009) <lb/>1.

In 2009, in every OECD country <lb/>except Japan and Turkey, more than 70% of higher education students in the field of education were women. <lb/>On average across OECD countries, 75% of the degrees awarded in the field of health and welfare also went <lb/>to women. By contrast, in most countries, fewer than 30% of all graduates in the fields of engineering, <lb/>manufacturing and construction were women. <lb/>In a handful of countries, gender imbalances in some traditionally male-dominated fields of study <lb/>are beginning to shrink. For example, in the Czech Republic, Germany and the Slovak Republic, the <lb/>proportion of women graduating with science degrees grew by more than 10 percentage points between <lb/>2000 and 2009. As a result, these countries are now closer to the OECD average of 40% – a figure that <lb/>has remained stable over the past decade. In 2000, the European Union announced a goal to increase <lb/>the number of university graduates in mathematics, science and technology by at least 15% by 2010, and to <lb/>reduce the gender imbalance in these subjects. So far, however, progress toward this goal has been marginal. <lb/>Overall, however, the strong progress of women in education is translating into positive outcomes in the labour <lb/>market. In 2009, an average of 79% of women with a higher education qualification were employed, compared <lb/>to 66% of women with an upper secondary qualification, and 46% of women without an upper secondary <lb/>qualification. Notably, women are still less likely than men to participate in the labour market – even when they <lb/>have the same qualifications – and are also more likely to work part-time. <lb/></body>

For instance, the gender gap in employment narrowed from 25 percentage points <lb/>in 2000 to 21 percentage points in 2009 among those without an upper secondary qualification, and from <lb/>19 percentage points in 2000 to 15 percentage points in 2009 among those with an upper secondary <lb/>qualification. And it&apos;s narrower still among those with a higher education qualification, decreasing from <lb/>11 percentage points in 2000 to 9 percentage points in 2009. <lb/>These figures can vary widely across countries: among people without an upper secondary qualification, <lb/>the gender gap in employment is less than 10 percentage points in Finland, Iceland and Norway, <lb/>but more than 40 percentage points in Chile, Mexico and Turkey. Among people with a higher education <lb/>qualification, the gender gap in employment tends to narrow significantly in all OECD countries except <lb/>Japan, Korea, Mexico and Turkey, where it exceeds 15 percentage points. <lb/>100 <lb/>90 <lb/>80 <lb/>70 <lb/>60 <lb/>50 <lb/>40 <lb/>30 <lb/>20 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>% <lb/>Percentage of tertiary degrees awarded to women, by field of education (2009) <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Poland <lb/>Slovak Republic <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Brazil <lb/>Finland <lb/>Norway <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Spain <lb/>Canada 1 <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Argentina 1 <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>OECD average <lb/>United States <lb/>Chile <lb/>Israel <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Australia 1 <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Germany <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Austria <lb/>France <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Korea <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Japan <lb/>1.

For example, in the Nordic countries, <lb/>Germany and Portugal, fathers can receive a parental leave entitlement and income support during the leave <lb/>period. In Iceland, Norway and Spain, some firms are required to have at least 40% of their boardroom seats <lb/>assigned to women, depending on the size of the company and the number of board members. Similar initiatives <lb/>have been introduced in Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, other companies, such as <lb/>Deutsche Telekom, have introduced voluntary quotas for women in management and family-friendly practices <lb/>such as flex-time and tele-working. <lb/></body>
