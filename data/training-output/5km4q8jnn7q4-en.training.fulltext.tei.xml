			<p>JEL codes: D62, Q54, R41, R48<lb/> Keywords: transport, environment, modal choice, climate change, car technology<lb/> ABSTRACT<lb/> A brief review of long run projections of demand for road transport suggests that problems related to<lb/> road network congestion and greenhouse gas emissions are likely to become more pressing than they<lb/> are now. Hence we review, from a macroscopic perspective, popular policy measures to address<lb/> these problems: stimulating modal shift, regulating land use to reduce car use, and boosting low<lb/> carbon technology adoption to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We find that these policies can<lb/> produce tangible results, but that they may have unintended consequences that drive up costs<lb/> considerably.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Transport is closely linked with economic activity. Some types of transport provide inputs to<lb/> production in the form of commuting and business trips and by moving goods between producers and<lb/> consumers. The decrease in the cost of freight transport by a factor 10 over the last 100 years<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Glaeser &amp; Kohlhase, 2004</ref>) has facilitated a freight-intensive organization of production. Other forms<lb/> of transport help households carry out the activities they are interested in. Income growth stimulates<lb/> the demand for such transport and, together with the decrease in prices of car and air transport, has<lb/> generated a strong increase in individual mobility in rich countries for all kinds of activities, including<lb/> commuting, education, recreation, use of services, shopping, and tourism. Public policy has largely<lb/> accommodated – and sometimes inadvertently stimulated – these developments via its spatial<lb/> planning and infrastructure capacity decisions, so that economic development in advanced economies<lb/> has gone hand in hand with strongly growing transport volumes.<lb/> Despite its obvious success, this model meets with criticism. Current transport patterns are<lb/> widely seen as &quot; unsustainable &quot; , especially with emerging economies evolving towards current<lb/> advanced economies&apos; levels of economic welfare and transport activity. In economics, sustainability is<lb/> mostly defined in a narrow way (<ref type="biblio">Arrow et al., 2004</ref>) focusing on guaranteeing the consumption<lb/> possibilities of the future generations. It is clear that transport activities contribute to long-term<lb/> problems concerning climate change, jeopardize the long-term availability of oil resources, so<lb/> transport is relevant to the narrow sustainability problem. However, in the transport sector other, flow-<lb/>type, externalities threaten our current way of life. With continued urbanization and concentration of<lb/> economic activity in ever larger metropolitan areas, congestion levels could become intolerable. Levels<lb/> of noise and pollution remain problematic despite advanced emission control technology. Evidence<lb/> suggests that these flow externalities are quantitatively at least as important as the climate and energy<lb/> resource problem (cf. e.g. <ref type="biblio">Small and Van Dender, 2007 or Proost et al., 2009</ref>, for the EU).<lb/> Given these problems, it is widely felt that something must be done. Addressing the different<lb/> external costs of transport requires well-targeted policies, including congestion pricing, fuel taxes, and<lb/> fuel economy regulations. These are discussed in for example, Anas and Lindsey, 2010, and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Anderson et al., 2010.</ref> Here we focus on the role of modal choice, technologies and spatial structure<lb/> as framework factors that determine transport demand and its energy and environmental impact, and<lb/> that may be amenable to modification through policy. Taking such a broad view helps establish policy<lb/> priorities.<lb/> A word of caution is in order. What makes transport activities different from say house or<lb/> factory heating, two activities that also emit greenhouse gasses? There are two differences. First in<lb/> most transport activities users compete for the use of common transport infrastructure, causing<lb/> congestion. This level of congestion has a negative feedback on the volume of demand. The effect of<lb/> congestion on the volume of transport demand and the policies to address the problem are relatively<lb/> well understood in economics (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Small &amp; Verhoef, 2007</ref>). There is a second difference:<lb/> transport is ultimately the movement of persons or goods over space between houses, shops,<lb/> factories etc. Put naively, we can minimize transport activities by having a very large number of small<lb/> towns that are self sufficient. This comes at an economic cost in terms of productivity (scale, diversity,<lb/> specialization etc.) and in terms of other externalities (noise, neighbour interferences etc.). Our<lb/> knowledge of the long term interplay between economic development, spatial distribution of economic<lb/> activities and transport costs is at best still very partial (see <ref type="biblio">Fujita &amp; Thisse, 2002, for regional location<lb/> and Glaeser, 2008</ref>, for urban location). Often the causality runs both ways and multiple equilibriums<lb/> can exist. Poor knowledge by economists leaves a lot of room for interpretation by policy makers so<lb/> we should not be surprised to encounter very different policies.<lb/> Section 2 briefly reviews some scenarios on long-term developments of the demand for<lb/> transport, emphasizing that there is little hope for controlling transport externalities through reductions<lb/> in global transport volumes. Sections 3, 4 and 5 examine three policy levers: modal choice, technology<lb/> and spatial structure. In a nutshell, we find that policies that affect modal choice can in some cases<lb/> reduce environmental impacts, but whether they are attractive from a broader economic point of view<lb/> is far from obvious. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through improved technology is possible, at<lb/> relatively low cost and at first through the improvement of conventional drive-train technology. Spatial<lb/> structure affects transport demand, but using it as a policy lever is difficult and less effective than often<lb/> thought. In addition, limited understanding of the interactions heightens the risk of triggering<lb/> unintended – and undesirable – consequences. Section 6 concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. LONG TERM VIEWS AND DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL COSTS<lb/></head>

			<p>Taking a long-term view, this section explores how transport volumes (measured in passenger<lb/> kilometres and ton kilometres for freight) and the associated greenhouse gas emissions and levels of<lb/> congestion might evolve under a business-as-usual scenario.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1<lb/> Long-term trends in transport volumes<lb/></head>

			<p>Transport</p>

			<table>was responsible for about 13% of world greenhouse gas emissions in 2004, and it<lb/> represented 23% of greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion in 2005 (30% in the OECD; ITF,<lb/> 2009). Greenhouse gas emissions from transport depend on transport volumes and on the<lb/> carbon-intensity of the various technologies used. Section 3 discusses how technologies in a number<lb/> of key market segments could evolve. Here, we ask how demand for transport might develop. Various<lb/> institutions publish global projections for transport demand with a 2030 or 2050 horizon, see e.g. IEA<lb/> (2009), ITF (2009), Exxon (2009). These projections are based on partial models of the transport<lb/></table>

			<p>sector, focusing on the likely development of demand more than on supply and price formation. Oil<lb/> and fuel price developments, for example, are usually exogenous to the model, so independent of how<lb/> demand changes. The demand for private transport is driven mainly by income growth, according to<lb/> estimated S-shaped ownership dispersion patterns and assumptions on the evolution of usage. Given<lb/> that supply is often implicitly supposed to be perfectly or at least highly elastic, the projections can be<lb/> seen as sketching &quot; where demand would like to go &quot; .<lb/> While there are differences among them, the projections agree on the key expectations:<lb/> overall transport volumes will grow very rapidly in emerging economies, while growth will be much<lb/> slower in OECD countries and may even come to a halt in some segments of the transport market.<lb/></p>

			<p>With respect to private car travel, fast income growth in emerging economies translates into very fast<lb/> growth of car ownership levels, given the low initial levels of ownership and given population growth. In<lb/> the OECD, incomes grow at a more moderate pace and this means tepid growth of car stocks,<lb/> especially given already high ownership levels and often limited population growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Puentes and Tomer (2009) note that car travel in the US stopped growing in recent years, and<lb/> argue that this is not just the consequence of higher prices but also of saturation of demand, i.e. even<lb/> with higher incomes or lower prices the demand for transport would no longer increase. <ref type="biblio">Crozet (2009)<lb/></ref> makes a similar analysis for France, but notes that slower or zero growth of car transportation does<lb/> not mean that overall transportation demand stops increasing. Faster modes, such as high speed rail<lb/> and air transport, keep growing as incomes rise, as they allow consumers to squeeze more, and more<lb/> spatially dispersed, activities into the time budget. Although the jury is still out on whether car travel<lb/> has stopped growing in advanced economies, and if it did whether this is because of saturation with<lb/> travel, a zero income effect, higher fuel prices, or a combination of these factors, it is plausible that car<lb/> travel volumes will grow slowly or not at all in advanced economies and grow rapidly in emerging<lb/> economies. The overall result is considerable growth of world car transport volumes as well as in<lb/> faster travel modes (air, high speed rail) and freight transport.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> Expected GHG emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>Policies that aim to control traffic growth in advanced economies or reduce the carbon<lb/> intensity of travel in those countries may or may not be justifiable, but they will in</p>

			<table>all likelihood not be<lb/> sufficient to reduce global emissions if expectations on how emerging economies will evolve hold true.<lb/> Although better fuel economy offsets part of the demand growth, the result is that, in a business as<lb/> usual scenario, world transport emissions of CO2 are expected to more than double by 2050 (ITF,<lb/> 2008). According to the same exercise, the share of OECD countries in total transport emissions is<lb/> about 60% in 2010, declining to 45% in 2030 and 35% in 2050. The share of light-duty vehicle<lb/> emissions in the total is expected to decline from 42% in 2010 to 36% in 2030 and in 2050. The share<lb/> of aviation is set to grow, from 15% in 2010 to 22% in 2030 and in 2050.<lb/> These expectations are clearly not compatible with ambitious climate change mitigation<lb/> objectives, and the underlying transport volume growth also raises challenges in terms of other<lb/> transport related externalities, including noise, traffic safety, conventional air pollution and congestion.<lb/> The continuing trend towards urbanization and the particularly fast growth of the number of<lb/> megacities 2 further stresses the need to address local pollution and congestion problems.<lb/></table>

			<p>Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the availability and the security of resources to fuel all this<lb/> transport activity. Even taking into account that growth may be slowed down by higher energy prices, it<lb/> is still widely accepted that policy interventions are needed to control the main transport externalities.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3<lb/> Main types of externalities<lb/></head>

			<p>Transport activities cause a range of external costs, i.e. costs that are ignored by users when<lb/> they decide if, where, how, and when to travel. The level of these externalities depends on many<lb/> factors. For surface transport, key determinants include traffic volumes, mode choice, fuel type, fuel<lb/> efficiency, driver behaviour, and the location and time of day of travel.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 1 summarizes the main externalities and their drivers. Of the five externalities<lb/> mentioned, we will not discuss in this paper conventional air pollution, noise and traffic accidents.<lb/> Conventional air pollution and noise occur at the local level and can be contained to a substantial<lb/> degree by fairly inexpensive technical solutions. Over the period 2000-2020, the use of catalytic<lb/> converters, particulate traps and cleaner fuels is expected to reduce conventional air pollution of road<lb/> transport by 70 to 95% in the EU (TREMOVE, 2007). 3 Noise problems also can be handled to a large<lb/> 2 In 2008 about half of the global population lived in cities; in 2050 city dwellers are expected to make up about<lb/> 70% of the (bigger) total (UN, 2008),<lb/></table>

			<p>extent using better vehicles, public abatement (noise screens) and protective measures (noise<lb/> insulation). Accident externalities are complex and heavily dependent on coordination of human<lb/> behaviour. Well-enforced traffic regulations and car and road technology have greatly reduced the<lb/> average accident rate in most rich countries. The rationale for ignoring these externalities here is not<lb/> that the remaining problems are unimportant, but that addressing them will require customized policy<lb/> innovations that are unlikely to have major impacts on the fundamental features of our transport<lb/> systems. In debates about congestion and climate change, more incisive changes are sometimes<lb/> envisaged.<lb/></p>

			<p>Congestion and climate change externalities are both strongly dependent on the volume of<lb/> transport, but apart from that they are very different. With congestion there is a negative feedback loop<lb/> (more congestion leads to higher time costs of travel, and higher costs discourage demand).<lb/></p>

			<p>Congestion derives from the concentration of volumes in time and space. If spreading demand over<lb/> time and space were easy, there would be no congestion problem as there would be ample capacity to<lb/> handle volumes. This basic observation suggests that policies to spread demand may be as effective<lb/> as attempts to reduce overall demand. For climate change, transport volumes matter as well as the<lb/> carbon intensity of travel. The distribution of demand over time and space has no impact on<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions, except to the extent that congestion levels affect fuel consumption. It<lb/> follows that policies to address congestion and climate change costs concur to the extent that volume<lb/> reductions are concerned. Anas and Lindsey (this symposium) find that in the few cities where<lb/> congestion pricing has been implemented, transport volumes within charging zones decreased by<lb/> some 10-20% and so did the CO2 emissions. However if congestion pricing mainly redistributes<lb/> demand over time and over space, the best feasible policy to address congestion may have little<lb/> impact on greenhouse gas emissions and vice versa, so that confounding both issues in policy<lb/> debates may be unproductive.<lb/></p>

MODAL CHOICE<lb/></table>

			<head>3.1<lb/> Modal choice for passenger transportation<lb/></head>

			<p>In this section we consecutively discuss modal choice policies for passenger and for freight<lb/> transport. Passengers&apos; modal choices matter for many externalities. A car with 1 passenger has an<lb/> external congestion cost per passenger about 10 times as large as a bus with 25 passengers. Still<lb/> assuming sufficiently high occupancy rates, a bus uses also less fuel and causes less accident costs per<lb/> passenger. Rail uses separate track and its air pollution cost per passenger depends on the occupancy<lb/> rate and on the type of fuel used to generate the electricity needed. With a high occupancy rate, rail has<lb/> almost no external costs except for the congestion costs among the rail passengers and rail freight, and<lb/> the external noise costs. These comparisons suggest that external costs of transport can be mitigated by<lb/> favouring bus and especially rail transport, an idea that has gained currency widely in policy circles.<lb/></p>

			<table>The present market shares of different modes differ strongly across countries. In 2005, private<lb/> passenger cars had a market share, in terms of passenger kilometre, of less than 20% in China and India<lb/> (IEA, 2009, p. 50). The other passenger kilometres were taken care of by minibuses, busses, rail and air.<lb/> In OECD Europe, cars account for 65% of total volume, bus and rail 15% and air about 15% as well. In<lb/> North America, cars take account of approximately 80%, bus and rail 5% and 15% is air transport (IEA<lb/> 2009). Congestion and air pollution problems are more acute in urban areas. Urban transport is a small<lb/> share of overall passenger transport (about 20 %) and also for urban transport modal shares are very<lb/> different across countries. One of the striking differences is the much higher share of busses and rail in<lb/> OECD Europe, China and India compared to many North-American cities.<lb/> 14<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14<lb/></table>

			<p>There are three main drivers of modal choice for passengers (<ref type="biblio">De Jong &amp; Van Riet, 2008</ref>): income<lb/> levels, relative user costs (including time costs) and public policy. As discussed in Section 2, higher<lb/> incomes lead to increased demand for transport services, in particular for car ownership and use. Higher<lb/> incomes also tend to imply higher opportunity costs of time, and this means an increased preference for<lb/> faster modes: at first car transport, then high speed rail and air transport which allow covering large<lb/> distances in short time frames. Population density and land use matter as well (see Section 4.2): high<lb/> population densities are necessary for rail, light rail and metro solutions to become economically<lb/> attractive. Finally, public policy affects modal choice. Public transport solutions like busses and rail are<lb/> characterized by economies of density and by economies of scale (although scale economies for bus<lb/> operations are exhausted in even medium sized cities). It is very costly to construct a railway track but<lb/> once in place, the variable cost of a train is low and roughly constant (as long as the network is not<lb/> congested). In addition, with more users, the occupancy rates increase, so that more vehicles need to be<lb/> deployed, so increasing the frequency of public transport services and reducing waiting times at stops<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Mohring, 1972</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.1<lb/> Urban transport<lb/></head>

			<p>Except for minibuses in developing countries and a few isolated exceptions, investment and even<lb/> operation costs of urban public transport are subsidized. The main justifications are the economies of<lb/> scale and second best pricing in urban areas where the external congestion and air pollution costs of car<lb/> use are not reflected in prices. Experience with public transport subsidies differs a lot among the different<lb/> continents and has given rise to fierce debate among economists. The optimization of public</p>

			<table>transport<lb/> fares on existing networks points to high subsidy rates when the external costs of car use are not reflected<lb/> in car use costs (see e.g. Proost and Van Dender, 2008 and Parry and Small, 2009) where even operation<lb/> costs are subsidized at more than 50%. However, high subsidies are no guarantee for a highly performing<lb/> public transit system. Winston &amp; Maheshri (2007) find that the US public rail systems are heavily<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14<lb/> 15<lb/> subsidized but not welfare improving, except for the BART in San Francisco. In many countries, light rail<lb/> systems have been absorbing a disproportionately large share of the public transport investments without<lb/> solid economic justification.<lb/> Duranton &amp; Turner (2010) found evidence for the fundamental law of road congestion in the US<lb/> cities: over the period 1983-2003 transport volumes increased proportionally to highway capacity. They<lb/></table>

			<p>found that individual as well as commercial traffic increased with the stock of roads in their city and that<lb/> cities with less congestion attract people. This implies that an increase in urban road transport is partly<lb/> generated by the new road capacity, so public policy matters. Second, they tested the full effect of a small<lb/> increase in highway capacity and found that, given the absence of congestion pricing, for most areas, the<lb/> costs of the investment were lower than the benefits. This does not imply that there are no beneficial road<lb/> investment projects but that these projects need also to be submitted to a rigorous economic analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, also these authors found that, in the US, the provision of public transport had no impact on<lb/> volumes of car transport.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Darido et al. (2009)</ref> compare broad policy approaches in Beijing and Shangai, showing how the<lb/> former focused on providing road capacity and the latter on mixed and dense development and restrictive<lb/> car use policies, with obvious effects on modal split and CO2-emissions. This clearly illustrates how<lb/> strategic policy choices can affect development, and the resulting diversity in spatial structures is<lb/> beneficial in itself.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.2.<lb/> Non urban transport<lb/></head>

			<p>For the medium distance passenger transport, the main competing modes are car, bus and rail.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the long distance (beyond 300km) HSR and air are the most important. Rail and HSR display strong<lb/> economies of scale and require a high patronage to be justified economically. HSR needs huge up front<lb/> investments and has low variable costs. An efficient HSR system requires high public investment<lb/> subsidies, fares that cover more or less the marginal operation costs, and a large market. <ref type="biblio">de Rus &amp; Nash,<lb/> 2007, and ITF, 2010</ref>,b estimate that in the most favourable circumstances (low construction cost and<lb/> distance of 500km), one needs a minimum of 6 to 9 million passengers in the first year to justify a<lb/> HSR-project; When the investment costs are mainly paid by public money, the door is wide open for<lb/> political lobbying. In the EU, China and Japan, governments have opted for a highly subsidized network of<lb/> HSR. In North America, no HSR system has yet been built. The current administration favours this<lb/> solution, but only limited funding has been made available to date.<lb/></p>

			<p>Air transport clearly is the main alternative for long distance trips. Air transport is less fuel efficient<lb/> per passenger kilometre than rail and it also generates more external noise costs (<ref type="biblio">Maibach et al. 2007</ref>). In<lb/> a study of all the main HSR projects in the EU, <ref type="biblio">Adler et al. (2010)</ref> find that some HSR projects are<lb/> economically justified on condition that prices reflect marginal costs and not average costs. They find also<lb/> that the environmental disadvantages of air transport are not at all sufficient to justify the HSR<lb/> investments. This limited environmental appeal is further reduced when account is taken of the emissions<lb/> during the construction phase, where high-speed rail is at a disadvantage. Furthermore, if environmental<lb/> and energy concerns dominate, then the more energy-efficient conventional rail may be preferable over<lb/> the high speed option.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, the economic analysis casts doubt on the validity of modal split as an intermediate<lb/> policy objective in the case of passenger transport. Rail and bus have a role to play in some markets, in<lb/> particular where densities of demand are very high. But to pursue modal change towards these modes<lb/> across the board can be a costly policy mistake. The rationale for investing in high-speed rail and bus lies<lb/> mainly in the spatial density of demand, much less – if at all – in environmental performance. There is a<lb/> striking difference between the policy options taken in the US and in the EU and Asia. This is partly a<lb/> reflection of different types of economic geography and spatial development. With differences in distances<lb/> and densities, different transport options regarding e.g. HSR and air can be economically justified.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Modal choice for freight transportation<lb/></head>

			<p>Up to 100 years ago the location of economic activities and cities was directly determined by<lb/> transport costs, as driven by access to railroads, ports and inland waterways. Since then the road network<lb/> has expanded dramatically and freight costs have declined strongly. This has given rise to relocation of<lb/> economic activity and a higher share for road freight transport at the expense of rail and inland waterways.<lb/> Road (and air) freight can be up to 10 times less fuel efficient than freight rail and a factor 100 or<lb/> more less fuel efficient than waterborne freight. So why did the shares of rail and inland waterway<lb/> shipping decline over time at road freight&apos;s expense? Explanations include changes in the nature of the<lb/> goods moved, the rising importance of speed and flexibility, and institutional factors. As an example of the<lb/> latter, moving a freight train through different EU countries traditionally required a different locomotive and<lb/> driver for every country that was crossed. In the US, in contrast, often one company organizes freight from<lb/> coast to coast, and this is one (not the only) reason for the higher modal share of rail in the US compared<lb/> to Europe.<lb/> In the EU, one of the main policy orientations of the last 15 years has been to discourage the<lb/> strong growth in road freight that accompanied the European integration process. In the CEC <ref type="biblio">(2001)<lb/></ref> paper, the policy objective was to approximately double the market share of</p>

			<table>both passenger and freight<lb/> rail traffic, which had fallen in 1998 to 6% (passenger) and 8% (freight) respectively. This required a<lb/> harmonization of procedures allowing the use of the same equipment and a single driver in different<lb/> countries. It also gave rise to a massive European subsidy program for rail investments. 4 Proost et al.<lb/> (2010) show that modal share objectives are not ideal for selecting investments. Analysis of a selection of<lb/> 22 of the 30 priority projects of the EU (worth a few hundred billion Euros), within a consistent top-down<lb/> CBA framework, shows that only 12 out of 22 projects pass the elementary efficiency test at a social<lb/> 18<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14<lb/></table>

			<p>discount rate of 5%. It also came out that only a minority of the selected projects has any real European<lb/> value added in the sense of local investments benefiting other countries, so that the case for European<lb/> funds is weak overall. Lastly, the TEN-T projects are not situated systematically in the poorer regions of<lb/> the EU, so it is difficult to defend the selection on pure equity grounds (whereas &quot; cohesion &quot; traditionally<lb/> features large in EU policy strategies).<lb/> This example of the misallocation of funds for transport investments is not an exception. <ref type="biblio">Knight<lb/> (2004)</ref> used the representative democracy model to analyze the decision making process applied to the<lb/> Interstate Highway Fund in the U.S.A. in the 1990s. The logic is that elected representatives try to favour<lb/> their own constituency. When they becomes agenda setters, they will form a winning majority of states by<lb/> selecting those states that are not costly to please in terms of public works and will use the opportunity to<lb/> favour their districts by selecting an oversupply of federally paid public works. Knight&apos;s findings suggest<lb/> that for every dollar invested, an additional dollar was wasted leading to the funding of a substantial<lb/> number of inefficient transport projects.<lb/> Overall, there are reasons to subsidize particular rail and inland waterways projects. Economies of<lb/> scale in rail and inland waterways require large investments and large public subsidies to operate the<lb/> infrastructure at their social marginal cost. However, the high public investment requirements have often<lb/> given rise to pork barrel politics and were not always justified in welfare terms. To reduce the probability of<lb/> wasteful use of public funds, it deserves recommendation to evaluate investment projects separately,<lb/> rather than build in an orientation towards modal shift at the strategic policy</p>

This is useful because it<lb/> recognizes that different modes work in different circumstances and avoids bias towards particular modes<lb/> through the adoption of artificial intermediate policy objectives like modal choice and greenhouse emission<lb/> limits for the transport sector.<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14<lb/> 19<lb/> 4. VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES<lb/> Greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks count for the bulk of GHG emissions in the<lb/> transport sector. 5 In the short term, one counts on the improvement of conventional engines to reduce<lb/> GHG (cf. Anderson et al., 2010). In the longer term new vehicle technologies that use other fuels could<lb/> deliver reductions of GHG emissions and avoid oil dependency and/or oil depletion. We discuss three<lb/> questions in this regard. First, how costly and environmentally efficient are these alternative technologies?<lb/></table>

			<p>Second, what is the willingness of consumers to adopt them? And third, do car manufacturers have<lb/> sufficient incentives to develop the new technologies?<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1<lb/> New car technologies<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> lists the technologies that could play a role at the 2020-2040 horizon, according to IEA<lb/> (2009). We start with the characteristics of new cars in the US and in the EU. Taking as basis (index=100)<lb/> the GHG emissions per vehicle mile in the OECD, one sees that there is a difference of 25% between US<lb/> and EU GHG emissions for new cars in 2010. Several factors are responsible for this but the dominant<lb/> factor is probably the difference in gasoline taxes and other car-related taxes. In the US, the tax on<lb/> gasoline is 17% of the resource cost, in the EU it can be 160% or more. 6 This implies an effective CO2 tax<lb/> (called gasoline tax) of 47 $/ ton of CO2 in the US and 365 €/ton of CO2 in the EU. In some EU countries,<lb/> diesel cars have a market share of over 50%. They are more fuel efficient but emit more conventional<lb/> pollutants (mainly highly damaging particulates even if a particulate trap is installed, <ref type="biblio">Maibach et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/> 5 According to IEA&apos;s MoMo-model, light-duty vehicles and freight trucks account for 70% of global tank-to-wheel<lb/> emissions of CO2 from transport,<lb/></p>

			<p>Car choices depend on fuel taxes but also on ownership or purchase taxes. <ref type="biblio">Braathen (2009)<lb/></ref> shows how tax schedules vary strongly among European countries and how taxes rise very strongly with<lb/> emission ratings in some cases.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For 2020-2040, it is not yet clear what type of cars will be used but it is likely that improved<lb/> conventional cars will still dominate the market. If the EU and Japan continue to use high taxes on<lb/> gasoline and diesel and if evermore stringent emission standards are used in an increasing number of<lb/> countries, new cars may emit only 50% as much as existing new cars for the same mileage, at an extra<lb/> cost of up to $2000/vehicle (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). This requires a combination of engine improvements, weight<lb/> reduction, better aerodynamics, reduced rolling resistance, etc. Some design choices will imply reducing<lb/> other desirable vehicle attributes, including size, comfort, and possibly (and more controversially) safety. If<lb/> current incentives are not re-enforced, emission reductions for conventional cars may be limited to 20%.<lb/> The next step, after the improved gasoline and diesel cars, are the hybrid cars. These are already<lb/> on the market but can become more efficient. They can offer an extra 20% saving compared to improved<lb/> gasoline and diesel cars, at a cost per vehicle of $2000 to $4000 compared to the standard gasoline and<lb/> diesel car. They are more expensive but have the advantage that they can bridge the gap with electric<lb/> cars. The intermediate technology is the plug-in-hybrid that has a larger battery to take power from the<lb/> grid but can still rely on a small combustion engine for longer trips.<lb/> The GHG reduction potential of plug-in-hybrids and electric vehicles depends ultimately on the<lb/> emissions associated with the production of electricity. If electricity production is mainly coal based (as<lb/> expected in the US, China and India), one needs well performing carbon capture and storage (CCS)<lb/> technologies before electric vehicles can deliver savings in GHG emissions compared to improved<lb/> conventional vehicles. Even where the base load on the electrical grid is produced in a low carbon manner<lb/> (nuclear or wind), the marginal load can be considerably more carbon-intensive, and transitioning to<lb/> broader low carbon loads takes time. Plug-in-hybrid and pure electric cars come at an extra cost of $7500<lb/> to over $10000/vehicle. They also have a more limited range and less trunk space. While improvements<lb/> will be made, it is not obvious that electric cars will become very close substitutes for conventional cars.<lb/> They may be sufficiently appealing for some market segments (e.g. multiple vehicle households in rich<lb/> economies), but expecting them to conquer the market overall appears unduly optimistic for the period up<lb/> to 2040. Electric mobility may be part of the solution for decarbonising transport, but it is not a panacea.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2<lb/> Low GHG fuels<lb/></head>

			<p>Apart from turning to more efficient conventional cars and electric cars, a third route to saving<lb/> GHG emissions in the road sector is to use low-carbon fuels, e.g. biodiesel, ethanol, and compressed<lb/> natural gas. These fuels can be used in conventional engines but require an additional distribution<lb/> infrastructure. Furthermore, when the whole fuel cycle is taken into account, several of these fuels deliver<lb/> no or only small GHG emission reductions and there are concerns about general equilibrium effects in<lb/> non-fuel markets (notably food prices). After the initial enthusiasm, awareness of the limitations of biofuels<lb/> has risen, and research into better performing fuels continues. As with electric vehicles, it seems that<lb/> biofuels can play a role in reducing road (or air) transport emissions, but setting quantity targets for their<lb/> deployment risks obtaining few real reductions at a high cost per unit. The other alternative fuel -<lb/>hydrogen-delivers GHG emission savings only if it is made with low carbon electricity, vehicle and<lb/> distribution costs are high. We see little scope for this solution over the next two or three decades.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3<lb/> Consumer attitudes and government policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Our second question, the attitude of consumers to new car technologies, has been studied<lb/> extensively since the 1990s as the state of California wanted zero emission vehicles to reach a significant<lb/> market share. Most non standard technologies offer a smaller range (pure electric vehicles), smaller trunk<lb/> space (natural gas, electric vehicles), smaller size (very fuel efficient vehicles etc.) and lower speed and<lb/> acceleration. Consumers&apos; purchase decisions are based on a subjective assessment of these and other<lb/> vehicle characteristics, given expected patterns of use and energy prices. The value of the various<lb/> attributes can be estimated using revealed and stated preference techniques (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Brownstone et al.,<lb/> 2000</ref>) and the values can be integrated into the &quot; fair &quot; comparison of alternative technologies. This<lb/> technique can be used for any new type of vehicle technology.<lb/> The results show that with a sufficient price discount, some consumers are prepared to accept the<lb/> discomfort of certain new technologies. Sometimes there even is even a &quot; green glow &quot; effect to driving<lb/> more costly cars with a green image. Again, the evidence is that there is a market for alternative<lb/> technologies but that one should not expect conventional technologies to be swept away as long as the<lb/> alternatives can&apos;t compete on key attributes, including purchase price and expected user costs.<lb/> What will drive the government policies in the car sector? There are four main concerns: climate<lb/> change, the tax base, the security of oil supply, and profits and employment in the domestic car industry.<lb/></p>

			<p>With respect to climate change, the probability that a general and strong global climate agreement is<lb/> signed and observed is small because climate change is a pure public bad and abatement benefits are<lb/> uncertain and come only in the very long run. As long as alternative car technologies remain expensive, it<lb/> is rather unlikely that there will be widespread adoption of the least carbon-intensive technologies, simply<lb/> because the threat of climate change cannot be translated into a credible policy commitment to cooperate<lb/> in the R&amp;D phase and stimulate such widespread adoption (<ref type="biblio">Barrett, 2006</ref>). However, for a big country that<lb/> wants to continue a climate policy in a non-cooperative world, developing low GHG car technologies and<lb/> transferring them to the rest of the world could be an important element of its strategy (see <ref type="biblio">Barla &amp; Proost,<lb/> 2008</ref>). Actually, Europe and Japan have in the past developed more fuel efficient cars that can be used in<lb/> the US, China, India etc. It appears, hence, that government policies are as much steered by strategic<lb/> industrial and trade considerations as by environmental concerns. A deeper understanding the</p>

			<table>different<lb/> national fuel efficiency policies as strategic trade policies, e.g. along the lines of Ulph and Ulph (2007), is<lb/> needed. 7<lb/> 24<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14<lb/></table>

			<p>There is a second reason why the adoption of technologies that use alternative fuels will be<lb/> limited. In many countries with high gasoline taxes, alternative fuels like electricity, natural gas and<lb/> biodiesel are subject to much lower excise duties than traditional fuels. This strong tax incentive is<lb/> unsustainable for the tax authorities who see their revenue base eroded in case of a large shift towards<lb/> lower-taxed fuels. Of course removing the tax advantage makes alternative fuels less attractive. The<lb/> political tension between environmental and public finance concerns shifts over time, but the latter<lb/> ultimately tend to weigh heavily on decisions. In addition, it is expected – or hoped – that countries sooner<lb/> or later move away from an energy-based taxation system for road transport towards one based on<lb/> distance, time of day and place (see e.g. NTPP, 2009, and Anas and Lindsey, 2010, this symposium). 8<lb/></p>

			<p>The price increases necessary to contain other externalities will keep traffic from growing too strongly but<lb/> abandoning fuel or energy as the main tax base means that the progress to more fuel efficient cars will be<lb/> based mainly on technologies that are already available (see <ref type="biblio">Proost et al., 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Higher oil prices and the concern for oil supply security are in principle an extra incentive to<lb/> reduce the oil consumption in the road sector. As long as this reduction takes the form of more fuel<lb/> efficient vehicles, the oil security concern and the climate concern work in the same direction. Whenever<lb/> the oil import concern implies the use of more non-conventional fuel, both concerns can diverge as the<lb/> production of some non-conventional fuel generates much higher CO2 emissions.<lb/> Finally, in this debate, the interaction between long-run and short-run policy approaches needs<lb/> consideration for two reasons. First, in the short run conventional vehicles are made more efficient,<lb/> switching to alternative technologies is more difficult (all else equal). Second as both oil reserves and<lb/> 10% in 2007; its share in global triadic patent families increases from 0.1% to 1.1% over the same period (OECD,<lb/> 2010).<lb/> greenhouse gas concentrations have a stock dimension, fuel efficiency policies may have unintended<lb/> consequences via intertemporal re-optimization of the depletion paths (van der <ref type="biblio">Ploeg &amp; Withagen, 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>5. TRANSPORT AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE<lb/></head>

			<p>The distribution of economic activity over space co-determines transport patterns and volumes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Conversely, transport costs co-determine the location of economic activity. Section 4.1 reviews key<lb/> insights from the new economic geography, focusing on agglomeration economies. Adopting a narrower,<lb/> microscopic perspective, Section 4.2 summarizes theoretical and applied work on the relation between<lb/> urban spatial structure and transport volumes. More specifically, the widespread view that urban sprawl<lb/> leads to excessive transport volumes and thus justifies land-use policies, is investigated. This debate<lb/> matters for greenhouse gas emissions for two reasons. First, transport activity is a direct source of<lb/> emissions. Second, urban density affects also the energy use for heating and cooling via the size and type<lb/> of dwellings.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1<lb/> Transport and agglomeration<lb/></head>

			<p>The spatial distribution of activities obviously is an important driver of transport demand.<lb/></p>

			<p>Passenger transport flows are dependent on the locations of workplace, school, recreation facilities,<lb/> shops, etc. Freight transport flows depend on the organization of production and the location of input and<lb/> output markets. In the other direction, location choices (at any level of spatial resolution) depend on<lb/> transport costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The new economic geography provides a macroscopic (yet microeconomic) framework that helps<lb/> get a grip on the evolution of the spatial distribution of economic activity, through its focus on the location<lb/></p>

			<p>The new economic geography analysis differs from the &quot; fixed location &quot; view that is common in<lb/> transport economics, and highlights that decisions on what transport networks to develop have a direct<lb/> and long-lasting impact on where economic activity will take place and how efficient it will be. Ideally,<lb/> these location effects should be taken into account in appraisal but the state of the art of research<lb/> probably does not yet allow the construction of models that provide concrete, project-specific policy<lb/> guidance.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2<lb/> Passenger transport and urban sprawl<lb/></head>

			<p>Whereas much of transport economics takes locations of households and firms as given, urban<lb/> economics has focused on tradeoffs between transport and property or rental costs in location decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>A stylized fact in this context is that many households favour living in relatively low-density urbanized<lb/> environments, and employers choose to locate out of city centres in response to high central city prices.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where legislation and other framework conditions allow it (or favour it 9 ), the result is urban development<lb/> with fairly low-densities and decentralized distribution of employment. This pattern is particularly prevalent<lb/> in – but not unique to – the postwar United States, and is often labelled as urban sprawl. Sprawl has a<lb/> negative connotation, being associated with a range of problems. For example, decentralization and low<lb/> densities are thought to generate lifestyles that induce excessive car travel and energy consumption.<lb/></p>

			<p>Travel survey data indeed suggest a strong dependence of distances travelled on residential<lb/> density (a common but imperfect indicator for sprawl). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the relation for the US in 1995, and<lb/> clarifies that density has hardly an impact on the number of trips but a large impact on average annual<lb/> distance travelled, with households in the least dense areas travelling 20% more than the average<lb/> household and households in the most dense areas travelling 25% less. At first sight, then, sprawl (lower<lb/> density development) would seem to inflate travel distances by increasing average trip lengths. Apart from<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to control these externalities, well-targeted policies are required. External congestion<lb/> costs, and possibly local air pollution costs, ideally are reflected in congestion charges. Greenhouse gas<lb/> emissions are closely linked to fuel consumption, and hence are best dealt with through fuel taxes. Private<lb/> development choices can be steered through property and development taxes. There are two problems<lb/> with this line of reasoning. First, in practice, these ideal instruments are not implemented. Instead, a wide<lb/> range of instruments affect location decisions and transport costs, so that it is not ex ante clear in which<lb/> direction urban form is distorted, although the dominant view is that zoning policies and underpricing of<lb/> transport lead to too low densities. Second, when one allows for the development of new cities, the<lb/> optimal equilibrium may well contain more cities, more polycentricity and more sprawl (see <ref type="biblio">Anas &amp; Pines,<lb/> 2010</ref>). This is not unimportant when one considers the problems and growth of mega-cities in newly<lb/> developing countries that will see car ownership grow exponentially.<lb/> A particularly popular policy approach is to rely on command-and-control type of regulations that<lb/> directly regulate land-use by stipulating what kind of development is allowed where. When they are<lb/> enforceable, such instruments certainly are effective, i.e. they produce tangible results. However, they are<lb/> not necessarily cost-effective (i.e. the results may be obtained at too high a cost) or efficient (i.e. the<lb/> results don&apos;t necessarily coincide with what an efficient market would produce). Hence, direct regulations<lb/> can only be justified when there are severe restrictions on better targeted instruments and when the extra<lb/> costs of using command-and-control approaches are worth incurring.<lb/></p>

			<p>As indicated above, recent empirical studies investigate whether the strong link between residential<lb/> density and travel distance, as shown in</p>

			<table>Table 3, implies an equally strong causal connection in the sense<lb/> of higher density reducing travel distance; for a detailed review, see NRC, 2009. Work using<lb/> disaggregated data shows that this causal link exists but is not as strong as it appears at first sight. The<lb/> reason is that households sort into particular locations on the basis of their preferences (captured through<lb/> observed and non-observed characteristics), and those preferences partially explain transport choices<lb/> rather than density alone. The result is that no major reductions in transport volumes or energy<lb/> consumption should be expected unless truly drastic changes in land-use are brought about (Bento et al.,<lb/> 2005, Brownstone and Golob, 2009). Brownstone and Golob (2009) find that, for two Californian<lb/> households that are otherwise identical in observed characteristics, a difference in residential density of<lb/> 1,000 housing units per square mile (40% of the sample mean) leads to 1,171 fewer miles driven and 64.7<lb/> less gallons of gasoline consumed per year; this is 4.7% and 5.5% of the sample mean, respectively. Of<lb/> the change in gasoline consumption, about 2/3 is due to less driving and 1/3 to the fact that households in<lb/> denser areas tend to own more fuel-efficient vehicles. Changing driving and energy consumption by about<lb/> 5% of course is not negligible, but it is highly doubtful that changing density by 40% is feasible in all but a<lb/> limited number of circumstances. According to evidence mentioned in Brownstone and Golob (2009),<lb/></table>

			<figure>about 6.6% of 456 US cities increased population density by more than 40% between 1950 and 1990 (and<lb/> those that did tended to experience declining living conditions), while in the median city it declined by<lb/> 36%. The NRC Special Report (NRC, 2009) concludes that the potential of anti-sprawl policies is limited,<lb/> insisting nevertheless that this limited potential should be exploited, by removing excessive constraints on<lb/> development and – ultimately – consumer choice. 11<lb/></figure>

			<p>A potential message for newly (re-)developing cities could be that rapid declines of density along<lb/> the US model ought to be avoided if energy use is to be contained. However, such policies can be costly<lb/> in terms of welfare and probably are justified only when the shadow price of carbon is high. Even with<lb/> stringent decarbonisation targets, there are less costly policies than those that focus on discouraging<lb/> driving for the sake of energy saving alone (<ref type="biblio">Van Dender, 2009</ref>). In addition, reducing sprawl to residential<lb/> density can produce misleading results on the connection between urban spatial structure and travel<lb/> needs, as the latter depend on other factors as well. For example, a monocentric city likely displays longer<lb/> commutes on average than a polycentric city of the same residential density. <ref type="biblio">Gaigné et al. (2010)</ref> point<lb/> out that polycentricity under many circumstances may be a better way to contain travel demand and<lb/> energy consumption than striving for a more compact city, especially because making one city more<lb/> compact may well mean that another becomes more sprawled. This general equilibrium view,<lb/> emphasizing that it is the overall outcome that matters and not just what happens in one city, is also<lb/> discussed in Glaeser and Kahn (2010). Taking such a global view naturally leads one to favour carbon<lb/> taxes instead of local policies to handle emissions of greenhouse gases.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Road and air transport, two less energy efficient modes of transport, will continue to expand. Road<lb/> use in emerging economics will soon account for more than half of the world car and truck use. This paper<lb/> has analyzed three types of policy levers to address the growing GHG emissions and congestion<lb/> externalities associated to this development.<lb/></p>

			<p>Modal switch from road and air to rail and inland waterways offers in theory a huge potential.<lb/> However, the vigorous pursuit of modal shift in the EU shows that such a shift is justified only when the<lb/> spatial density of demand is sufficiently high. The environmental and congestion performance of rail and<lb/> canals is in general a bad guide for massive investments in these modes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the last 20 years, technological developments for cars and trucks have allowed to reduce<lb/> conventional air pollution by a factor 5 or so. Achieving the same level of progress for GHG emissions will<lb/> be difficult. The fuel efficient cars sold where fuel taxes are high can be adopted in the rest of the world. If<lb/> the policy of high gasoline taxes and strict fuel efficiency standards is continued, the conventional car<lb/> technology can become 50% more efficient and is therefore likely to stay around for the next 20 to<lb/> 40 years. Plug-in hybrids smoothen the transition to the electric vehicle. Compared to the improved<lb/> combustion engines, the electric car technology is only interesting in terms of GHG emissions if the<lb/></p>

			<head>32<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14<lb/> electric power production is itself not very GHG-intensive and this implies requires Carbon Capture and<lb/></head>

			<p>Storage in most regions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Transport needs are the result of the spatial distribution of activities. Policy makers are tempted to<lb/> use land use planning to increase residential densities and to limit commuting distances. These policies<lb/> have a rather limited potential because lower densities result from non-internalized externalities but also<lb/> from a preference for low density. In addition, our limited understanding of location choices implies that<lb/> well-intentioned policies can have widely diverging outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our overview of policy challenges related to congestion and climate change, and of proposed solutions<lb/></p>

			<p>shows that containing overall transport volumes is very difficult, and is only justified in some cases rather<lb/> than as a general strategy. Reducing the sector&apos;s carbon footprint will to a large extent be a technological<lb/> challenge. Here, progress is being made, and fuel economy can be improved at moderate costs. Whether<lb/> such improvements will actually materialize is a matter of strong policy commitment to decarbonisation<lb/> goals. Whether reducing carbon emissions in transport is the cheapest way of attaining decarbonisation<lb/> targets is not obvious either.</p>
