			<p>This paper presents the outline and first results of an OECD project, undertaken under the auspices of<lb/> the Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI), on the<lb/> development and collection of internationally comparable indicators on public funding of R&amp;D. Direct<lb/> funding of R&amp;D is one of the main policy instruments used by governments to support science and<lb/> innovation in priority areas. As noted in the OECD Innovation Strategy, countries are restructuring and<lb/> adapting their research-financing mechanisms, for example by creating new agencies in charge of<lb/> allocating resources, making greater use of competitively awarded project funding and exploring how to tie<lb/> funding more closely to specific objectives and missions, increasing the focus on the quality and relevance<lb/> of institutions&apos; research activities in pursuit of research excellence and economic and social impact. These<lb/> changes highlight a gap in the range of available indicators to monitor how public funding of R&amp;D is<lb/> allocated. As a result, the NESTI project aims to propose a methodology for internationally comparable<lb/> indicators on modes of public funding; collecting such indicators and assessing the feasibility of extending<lb/> their scope by developing guidelines for the implementation of the methodology as part of the regular<lb/> indicator activities of OECD and other organisations like Eurostat.<lb/> Reflecting the evidence priorities highlighted above, this project has focused on drawing a distinction<lb/> between institutional and project funding. This distinction has been applied to estimates of funding levels<lb/> across sector of R&amp;D performance, types of funding agencies and the orientation of the R&amp;D from the<lb/> funders&apos; perspective.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper presents the results of the data collection across 18 participating countries, demonstrating<lb/> that it is possible to produce new policy relevant indicators on public funding of R&amp;D in addition to those<lb/> envisaged in the OECD Frascati Manual. The data collection initial findings highlight interesting<lb/> differences across countries in terms of their approaches to funding R&amp;D. But before conclusions can be<lb/> drawn on the effectiveness of the different country funding profiles, further work is needed in order to<lb/> increase the reliability and comparability of the different indicators.<lb/></p>

Le financement direct de la R-D est l&apos;un des principaux instruments utilisés par<lb/> les pouvoirs publics pour soutenir la science et l&apos;innovation dans les domaines prioritaires. Comme le<lb/> prévoit la Stratégie de l&apos;OCDE pour l&apos;innovation, les pays opèrent une restructuration et un<lb/> réaménagement de leurs mécanismes de financement de la recherche, par exemple en instituant de<lb/> nouveaux organes chargés de l&apos;allocation des ressources, en faisant davantage jouer la concurrence pour<lb/> l&apos;octroi de fonds aux projets de recherche, en cherchant les moyens d&apos;établir un lien plus direct entre le<lb/> financement et des objectifs et des missions spécifiques, en privilégiant davantage la qualité et la<lb/> pertinence des activités de recherche des établissements, au regard de critères d&apos;excellence et d&apos;impact<lb/> social et économique de la recherche. Ces évolutions ont mis en évidence l&apos;insuffisance de la gamme<lb/> d&apos;indicateurs disponibles pour analyser la manière dont sont affectées les aides publiques à la recherche.<lb/> Le projet du GENIST a par conséquent pour objet : de proposer une méthodologie pour le développement<lb/> d&apos;indicateurs comparables au niveau international sur les modalités de l&apos;aide publique ; de collecter ces<lb/> indicateurs ; d&apos;évaluer dans quelle mesure on pourra intégrer d&apos;autres pays ; et de mettre au point des<lb/> lignes directrices pour l&apos;application de cette méthodologie dans le cadre des activités régulières<lb/> d&apos;indicateurs de l&apos;OCDE et d&apos;autres organisations, comme Eurostat.<lb/> Compte tenu de ces besoins prioritaires en matière de données, ce projet s&apos;est axé sur l&apos;établissement<lb/> d&apos;une distinction entre financement par établissement et financement par projets. Cette distinction a été<lb/> appliquée aux estimations de niveaux de financement pour tous les secteurs d&apos;exécution de la R&amp;D, pour<lb/> toutes les catégories d&apos;organismes de financement et pour toutes orientations de la R&amp;D du point de vue<lb/> des bailleurs de fonds.<lb/> Ce document présente les résultats de la campagne de collecte de données réalisée dans les dix-huit<lb/> pays participants et montre qu&apos;il est possible de produire certains indicateurs pertinents pour les politiques<lb/> publiques sur le financement public de la R&amp;D qui ne figurent pas dans le Manuel de Frascati. Les<lb/> premières constatations issues de la collecte de données mettent en évidence d&apos;intéressantes différences<lb/> entre les pays dans leur approche du financement de la R&amp;D. Mais avant de pouvoir tirer des conclusions<lb/> sur l&apos;efficacité des différents modèles nationaux de financement, il faut peaufiner les différents indicateurs<lb/> de manière à améliorer leur fiabilité et leur comparabilité.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Within national R&amp;D systems, government funding is an important source of finance for R&amp;D. As<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows, for most countries it is the second major source of funds and the main one for a small<lb/> minority. The percentage of Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) financed by government<lb/> ranges between 14 and 70%, with an average of 30 to 35%. Alongside other policies, the funding of private<lb/> or public research is one of the main instruments a government can use to promote science and research.<lb/> There are significant differences in the way governments fund and regulate their research organisations.<lb/> For example: in some countries research organisations like higher education institutions have a large<lb/> autonomy, while other countries are characterised by a relationship between the government as funder of<lb/> R&amp;D and R&amp;D performing research organisations, which is regulated by performance contracts.<lb/></p>

			<p>The OECD Innovation Strategy (OECD, 2010a) has shown that countries are restructuring and<lb/> adapting their research-financing mechanisms, for example by creating new agencies in charge of<lb/> allocating resources, making greater user of competitively awarded project funding and exploring how to<lb/> tie funding more closely to specific objectives and missions, increasing the focus on the quality and<lb/> relevance of institutions&apos; research activities in pursuit of research excellence and economic and social<lb/> impact. These changes highlight a gap in the range of available indicators to monitor how public funding<lb/> of R&amp;D is allocated.<lb/></p>

			<figure>DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 7<lb/> In the framework of the OECD Frascati Manual (OECD<ref type="biblio">, 2002</ref>), funding of R&amp;D by the government<lb/> is measured is two ways: a) by asking performers of R&amp;D across different sectors (business enterprises,<lb/> higher education, research institutes and private non profit) to specify the sources of funds – and<lb/> government in particular – for in-house (intramural) expenditures on R&amp;D; and b) by adopting a funder<lb/> perspective collecting data on government budget appropriations or outlays for R&amp;D (GBAORD). The<lb/> latter thus involves the analysis of government budgets and complementary sources. Countries follow both<lb/> approaches and data under both formats are covered in the Frascati Manual (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2002</ref>) and have been<lb/> collected for a large number of years by OECD and EUROSTAT. The funder-based data are mainly<lb/> classified by socio-economic objectives (SEO) according to the so-called NABS-classification<lb/> (Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets). GBAORD<lb/> data and their collection are described in Chapter 8 of the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). Because of the<lb/> different perspectives of data collection, the two data sets provide different types of policy-relevant<lb/> information.<lb/> At the moment, only a limited number of statistics and indicators on public funding are available,<lb/> principally government-funded R&amp;D in the different sectors of performance and government R&amp;D budgets<lb/> classified by socio-economic objectives. There is a widespread perception that the available indicators on<lb/> public funding do not align with the discussions and issues in actual science policy and the characteristics<lb/> of the science systems in the different countries (<ref type="biblio">Lepori et al., 2007a</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Lepori (2006)</ref> argues that the R&amp;D<lb/> statistical data have &quot; …. limitations due to the lack of categories and classifications that would be needed<lb/> for policy analysis &quot; . According to his vision, the design of the R&amp;D statistical system is &quot; …focusing on<lb/> input rather than on fluxes and producing national aggregates rather than data on sectors or on individual<lb/> organizations &quot; . In addition, the use of GBAORD data is not as common as that of performer based data<lb/> collected for the purposes of producing indicators of intramural expenditures, and international<lb/> comparisons are somewhat infrequent. No information is collected on funding agencies and instruments.<lb/> Because of the limited number of policy studies on the public funding of R&amp;D, researchers within the EU<lb/> Policies for Research and Innovation in the Move towards the European Research Area (PRIME) Network<lb/> of Excellence on research and innovation policy undertook an international study on the public funding of<lb/> R&amp;D projects and their cross-country comparability. The results of this study have been published in</p>

			<table>a<lb/> number<lb/> of<lb/> country<lb/> reports<lb/> and<lb/> scientific<lb/> articles,<lb/> available<lb/> on<lb/> www.enid-<lb/>europe.org/PRIME/project_funding.html.<lb/></table>

			<p>At the 2008 Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI)<lb/> meeting, countries agreed to start an exploratory pilot project on developing indicators of public funding of<lb/> R&amp;D, drawing on the findings of the EU PRIME Network. A number of countries were willing and able to<lb/> participate in the project led by the Netherlands. 1 The general aim of the project was briefly formulated as<lb/> follows: &quot; to collect data on modes of public funding &quot; . Modes of public funding refer to the different ways<lb/> public funding is allocated in the R&amp;D system to beneficiaries, the organisations responsible for funding<lb/> decisions and the instruments used.<lb/></p>

			<p>The project was initially envisaged with three specific aims: a) to propose a methodology for<lb/> internationally comparable indicators on public funding modes; b) to collect such indicators; c) to broaden<lb/> the scope of the project beyond the scope of the participating countries, to develop guidelines for the<lb/> implementation of the methodology on a larger scale and on a permanent basis as part of the regular<lb/> indicator activities of the international organisations OECD and EUROSTAT. It should eventually lead to<lb/> a revision of the Frascati Manual. The present paper focuses on the first two aims.<lb/></p>

			<p>This document is structured as follows. Firstly, the rationale for new indicators and the conceptual<lb/> framework are set out. The description of the data collection process then gives way to the analysis of the<lb/> various indicators collected on public funding modes. It is important to note that the reported indicators are<lb/> experimental and, as a result, international comparability is still limited. The paper concludes with a<lb/> summary review of the key issues encountered in collecting and comparing the data, leading to a final set<lb/> of recommendations for follow-up work. Annex 1 provides an overview of the definitions adopted<lb/> throughout the project, while Annex 2 sets out the indicators collected from participating countries. Annex<lb/> 3 summarises the metadata collected from countries, highlighting some of the differences regarding data<lb/> availability and potential comparability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Modelling public funding of R&amp;D through new indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>The existing indicators on public funding of R&amp;D have a long tradition, particularly those providing a<lb/> breakdown of budget allocations across different socio-economic objectives (SEO), although by focusing<lb/> on direct funding they do not capture the full range of funding instruments, excluding for example R&amp;D<lb/> tax incentives – which are the object of separate regular collection by NESTI – and other indirect<lb/> mechanisms. Because governments on average are the second main funder of R&amp;D in the different<lb/> countries of the OECD with an average of 28% of total R&amp;D, budget allocations across dimensions other<lb/> than explicit socioeconomic objectives can have major impact on the way the national research systems are<lb/> organised and ultimately on their performance. Governmental research and science policy has evolved over<lb/> the years, reflecting debates on key policy issues such as the balance between institutional and project<lb/> funding and the balance between competitive versus non-competitive funding. While public R&amp;D funding<lb/> is one of the major instruments for steering the research system, many OECD countries introduced reforms<lb/> of their funding system to respond to new societal demands and challenges (<ref type="biblio">Maass, 2003</ref>). New funding<lb/> schemes and instruments were developed and implemented, such as performance-based and competitive<lb/> funding programmes, the promotion of co-operation with the private sector, new centres of excellence, new<lb/> foundations and new problem-oriented research programmes.<lb/> Throughout this project, a simplified model of public R&amp;D funding flows has been used (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> The model has three different layers. The indicators developed relate to these different levels.<lb/> a) The government or state level with its institutional funding of R&amp;D, to business enterprises, higher<lb/> education institutions or research institutes and project funding via a number of intermediary<lb/> organisations. These funding modes or general institutional funds refer to so-called block funds<lb/> that are allocated to research performing institutions with generally no strings attached on the one<lb/> hand (institutional funding) and funding based on grants from some kind of competitive funding<lb/> on the other (project funding). These funding modes also include the flow of funds going abroad,<lb/> either to performing organisations or international bodies that distribute those funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>b) An intermediary level of organisations tasked with redistributing and allocating the R&amp;D funds to<lb/> the final beneficiaries. These organisations typically have some degree of operational<lb/> independence even if they may be formally part of governments. This level includes the<lb/> international funding agencies too. This includes national funding and international funding<lb/> agencies.<lb/></p>

			<p>c) The level with organisations performing R&amp;D, which can be grouped into four R&amp;D sectors of<lb/> performance (business enterprises, higher education, government and private non-profit) alongside<lb/> organisations and institutes and (research) organisations abroad. The latter category also includes<lb/> extra-territorial organisations with activities located within the funding country (for a description<lb/> of these sectors, see the OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002) sections 3.4 through to 3.7).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. An overall funding model<lb/> Source: Based on Lepori et. al. (2007b)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The key new classification for data collection on government R&amp;D funding introduced in this project<lb/> is based on the distinction between institutional funding and project funding. In the PRIME project, the<lb/> concept of project funding was defined as: &quot; money attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&amp;D<lb/> activity limited in scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a project proposal<lb/> describing the research activities to be done &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Lepori et al., 2007b</ref>). It is important to highlight that the<lb/> concept of project funding does not primarily rely on funds being allocated on competition between<lb/> researchers or research groups, which is based on the submission of a research proposal. The main criteria<lb/> to distinguish between project 2 and institutional funding instruments are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• The aim of the funding instrument (from the perspective of the funding authority), rather than the<lb/> effective use of funds for R&amp;D activities.<lb/> • The existence of an agency tasked with selecting the project(s) to be funded and allocating the<lb/> money to R&amp;D performing beneficiaries. The agency can have a variety of forms such as a unit<lb/> within a ministry, or arms-length bodies such as research council or regional authorities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In contrast, institutional funding can be defined as the funding of institutions with no direct<lb/> selection of projects or programmes to be performed. Under this type of funding, it is the receiving<lb/> institution that has discretion over the R&amp;D projects that are to be performed, not the funding organisation.<lb/> This project has considered classifications of funders and performers 3 which are consistent with the<lb/> Frascati Manual. A first distinction has been made between national and international funders and<lb/> performers.<lb/></figure>

In total, these add up to the<lb/> national GBAORD plus the resource flows from international R&amp;D funding agencies. Six different<lb/> funding modes are distinguished, based on the distinction between project versus institutional funding,<lb/> national and international funding and national and international performers. The different indicators to be<lb/> collected can be related to the different cells of the table. Box 1 presents some examples of the different<lb/> funding modes.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 11<lb/> Box 1. Examples of different funding modes<lb/> National public project funding to national performers [funding mode (1)]<lb/> • R&amp;D domestic (commissioned) contracts from government.<lb/> • R&amp;D contributions to the national funding agencies by Government (e.g. research council and innovation<lb/> promotion agencies who distribute funds on a programme or project basis).<lb/> National public institutional funding to national performers [funding mode (2)]<lb/></figure>

			<p>• General university funds (GUF) -a separate category of government funding to the higher education sector.<lb/> • Other institutional funds (governments R&amp;D intramural expenditure + residual R&amp;D contributions from the<lb/> government).<lb/></p>

			<figure>National public project funding to international performers [funding mode (3)]<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Government-funded R&amp;D international contracts related to specific projects or programmes.<lb/></p>

			<table>• Contributions (annual membership fees) to EU-framework programmes (for European Free Trade<lb/> Association countries only)<lb/> • Contributions (annual membership fees) to trans-national public R&amp;D programmes.<lb/> Examples of Europe-wide trans-national public R&amp;D programmes include:<lb/> • ERA-NETs and ERA-NETs +<lb/> • European Space Agency (ESA)<lb/> • European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA)<lb/> • EUREKA<lb/> • COST<lb/> • EUROCORES<lb/> • Article 169 initiatives: EDCTP (Europe-Developing Countries Clinical Trials Platform), Eurostars (for<lb/> research-performing SMEs) and AAL (ambient assisted living for the elderly).<lb/> • Joint technology initiatives such as ENIAC (embedded computing systems), ARTEMIS (nanoelectronics).<lb/></table>

			<p>In the case of ESA, the membership fee is treated as project funding, since ESA redistributes this in the form of<lb/> project funding, based on agreed &quot; retour &quot; principles, and in this sense differs from the membership fee of the EU.<lb/></p>

			<figure>National public institutional funding to international performers [funding mode (4)]<lb/> • Contributions (annual membership fees) to international organisations (trans-national public R&amp;D<lb/> performers with own dedicated R&amp;D facilities). The (board of the) organisation decides about the<lb/> programmes or projects to perform within the organisation.<lb/> Examples of transnational public R&amp;D performers with own dedicated R&amp;D facilities:<lb/> • The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)<lb/> • The Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL)<lb/> • The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)<lb/> • European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)<lb/> • The European Southern Observatory (ESO)<lb/> • Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC)<lb/> International public project funding to national performers [funding mode (5)]<lb/> Examples of project funding from international organizations:<lb/> • Projects financed by the EU Framework Programme<lb/> International public institutional funding to national performers [funding mode (6)]<lb/></figure>

			<p>This category is included as a theoretical possibility for which examples are difficult to identify. It would<lb/> encompass contributions from international organisations to national performers on an institutional basis.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to the distinction between project and institutional funding and the national versus<lb/> international dimension, this project has also introduced a new classification for the type of government<lb/> instruments funding R&amp;D. This &quot; instrument type &quot; classification is based on the primary purpose or<lb/> objective pursued by Government in providing funding, on the basis of the likely use of the knowledge<lb/> supported by the funds. This classification is described in Box 2.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 2. Examples of other funding taxonomies – instrument types<lb/> • Academic instruments<lb/> The primary purpose of these instruments is the advancement of knowledge for the general<lb/> benefit of society. Funding can be provided by different funding agencies, such as contributions<lb/> from an independent or arms-length agency, e.g. project funding from a research council funding<lb/> research programmes or projects based on bottom-up proposals from researchers, except research<lb/> oriented programmes with clear politics aims. But it can be funding from other agencies too.<lb/> • Policy instruments<lb/> The primary purpose of these instruments is the contribution of commissioned research from<lb/> ministries or an independent or arms-length agencies&apos; funding programmes to inform and support<lb/> policy decisions or to fund programmes for knowledge generation within priority policy areas.<lb/> • Innovation instruments<lb/> The primary purpose of these instruments is the contribution to the innovative capacity of<lb/> enterprises through R&amp;D. Contributions from ministries of economic affairs or innovation agencies<lb/> to business R&amp;D programmes typically feature under this category.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Data collection and data sources used<lb/></head>

			<p>Different indicators were developed in the project which are related to the different cells or funding<lb/> modes of the table. The questionnaire which was used for the data collection at the end of 2009 was based<lb/> on the following five indicators on public funding:<lb/> 1. National public funding by funding type and destination (national and international performers);<lb/> related to funding modes (1),</p>

				<formula>(2), (3)</formula>

			<p>and (4).<lb/></p>

			<p>2. National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance;<lb/> related to funding modes (1)</p>

			<p>and (2).<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Public project funding to national performers by funding agency; related to funding<lb/> modes (1)and (5).<lb/> 4. National public project funding to national performers by instrument; related to funding mode<lb/> (1).<lb/> 5. International funding to national performers by sector of performance; related to funding modes<lb/> (5)and (6).<lb/></p>

			<figure>In order to construct the indicators, data were collected from countries participating in the project on a<lb/> voluntary basis. Data were requested for three years: 2000, 2005 and 2008 (or nearest year) as set out in<lb/> Annex 2, using the definitions provided in Annex 1. Based on a common format and pre-defined questions,<lb/> countries were also asked to provide metadata on the data collection: information on some characteristics<lb/> of the data source, examples of institutional funding and funding agencies and methodological problems<lb/> encountered. The results are summarised in Annex 3.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 13<lb/></figure>

			<p>As can be seen from the country metadata, the national GBAORD data collection is the main data<lb/> source in all countries, with budget items as the basic unit of analysis in most cases. These basic units were<lb/> classified according to the different variables within the questionnaire. In a number of cases the<lb/> classification was done on the basis of relevant complementary documents or information from external<lb/> experts. In some cases, the statistical agencies had to send information requests to experts in ministries or<lb/> other research funding bodies in order to obtain the relevant budget information for the classification.<lb/></p>

			<head>The indicators of public funding modes: relevance, definitions used and descriptive analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>This section presents the five indicators, describing in some detail on a one by one basis their<lb/> relevance, the definitions used, the resulting data and emerging results.<lb/></p>

			<head>Indicator 1: National public funding by funding type and destination (national or international<lb/> performers)<lb/></head>

			<p>The indicator focuses on total GBAORD within a country. It includes national and international<lb/> performers funding, which can be either project funding or institutional funding. This indicator relates to<lb/> the funding modes</p>

				<formula>(1), (2), (3) and</formula>

			<p>(4) of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Relevance<lb/></head>

			<p>The indicator is oriented to national public policies on research funding. It characterises the<lb/> organisation of national public funding, the distribution over different funding categories and the relative<lb/> contribution of institutional funding vis à vis project-based funding. This indicator can be used in principle<lb/> for snapshot cross-country comparisons. If longitudinal data are available, it can be used to show shifts in<lb/> the composition of national public funding, such as a shift from institutional funding to project funding.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definitions used<lb/></head>

			<p>National public funding comprises national public project funding and national public institutional<lb/> funding. The latter can be divided into institutional funding to the higher education sector – via the<lb/> estimated portion of General University Fund (GUF) devoted to R&amp;D – and institutional funding to other<lb/> public organisations or private companies. Project funding has no further sub-classification.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data and results<lb/></head>

			<p>Full data on this indicator are available for 17 countries, and partial information is available for one<lb/> additional country. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution of total national funding by all different funding modes<lb/> and destinations, national as well as international. Total national funding equals GBAORD for all<lb/> countries.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>			<figure>and Figure 4 focus on the funding to national performers.

			<head>Main findings<lb/></head>

			<p>• Public R&amp;D funding schemes vary widely between countries. Countries such as Switzerland,<lb/> Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland rely mainly on institutional funding (at a level of<lb/> around 70%), while Ireland, Belgium, and New Zealand devote more than 50% of public funding<lb/> to project funding.<lb/> • In the period 2000-2008 there seems to be a relative stability between modes of public R&amp;D<lb/> funding for most countries (at least for the countries with data for more than one year).<lb/> Exceptions are Australia and Austria where the share of project funding increases sharply. But<lb/> when one looks at the range of countries for which data were collected as part of the PRIME<lb/> project on public project funding 4 the long-term trend of public R&amp;D funding seems to show an<lb/> increase in project funding at the expense of institutional funding (<ref type="biblio">Lepori et. al. (2007b)</ref>). The<lb/> data for the countries participating both in the PRIME project and in the OECD project (Austria,<lb/> Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands) show that all countries experienced a considerable<lb/> increase in the share of project funding over the period 1970-2002. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, longitudinal data<lb/> for Australia and the Netherlands shows a sharp increase in the share of project funding for<lb/> Australia after 2000. The project share for the Netherlands increases between 1975 and 1990 and<lb/> remained broadly stable since after an initial decline in the early 1990s.<lb/></p>

			<p>• In half of the countries institutional funding of universities (GUF) takes up an important part of<lb/> total institutional funding, with a share above 50%, even up to 94% in Denmark. In the other<lb/> countries GUF plays a more modest role. However, the data should be treated with some caution,<lb/> because as is well known, not all countries can identify GUF separately (e.g. Korea) and the<lb/> methods applied can also differ.<lb/></p>

			<p>• National public funding to international research organizations seems to be a minor component of<lb/> national public R&amp;D funding (usually less than 5%) except for Switzerland and Belgium, which<lb/> devote more than 10% of their public R&amp;D funding to such international organizations.<lb/></p>

			<table>DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 16<lb/> • Although international project funding from abroad is an important funding source in a number<lb/> of countries (&gt; 10% of total R&amp;D in a country) and should be considered when dealing with<lb/> funding issues, this indicator excludes international funding in terms of funding from abroad. The<lb/> indicator is restricted to national public funding sources of R&amp;D. Funding from abroad is<lb/> considered in indicators 3 and 5.<lb/></table>

			<head>Indicator 2: National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance<lb/></head>

			<p>This indicator focuses on GBAORD funding to national performers. It follows the taxonomy adopted<lb/> for indicator 1 (funding type) but disaggregated further by the R&amp;D sector of performance. This indicator<lb/> relates to the funding modes (1) and (2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Relevance<lb/></head>

			<p>The indicator is intended to illustrate how governments support different types of national R&amp;D<lb/> performers through different mechanisms, highlighting for example the extent to which support for higher<lb/> education is mainly institutional or project-focused, compared with other sectors<lb/></p>

			<head>Definitions used<lb/></head>

			<p>National public project funding to national performers and national public institutional funding to<lb/> national performers. The national sector of performance is defined according to the Frascati Manual<lb/> definitions: business enterprise sector, higher education sector, government sector and private non profit<lb/> sector.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 17<lb/></p>

			<head>Data and results<lb/></head>

			<p>Data on this indicator are available for 15 countries. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the allocation of national public<lb/> funds to national performers separately for both project and institutional funding. This indicator excludes<lb/> international public funding (funds from abroad). This funding is considered in indicators 3 and 5. The<lb/> indicator also excludes national funding to international organisations and other funding of R&amp;D abroad. 5<lb/> It is therefore restricted to national public funding sources of R&amp;D.<lb/></p>

			<head>Main findings<lb/></head>

			<p>• The higher education sector is the main destination of institutional funding (mostly through GUF<lb/> funding). In nine countries this sector accounts for more than half of institutional funds.<lb/> However, there are also a number of countries with a substantial share of institutional funding<lb/> allocated to the government sector: Korea, Czech Republic, Belgium, Poland and Australia<lb/> allocate more than 50% of their institutional funds to this sector. The cases of institutional<lb/> funding to the business enterprise sector are rare, but exist in the Czech Republic, Israel and<lb/> Austria. In these countries the share of institutional funding in the business enterprise sector<lb/> ranges between 1% and 6%. In four other countries the share is 1%, while in the rest there is no<lb/> institutional funding to businesses. The exact nature of this funding should be further<lb/> investigated.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The sector of destination of project funding is more diversified. However, the public sector<lb/> (broadly defined in this case as the combination of higher education and government) has the<lb/> largest share in the majority of countries, with the exception of Austria (where the share of<lb/> businesses is 63%). However, in quite a number of countries (ten) the share of business<lb/> enterprises is significant (20% or more).<lb/></p>

			<p>• Data for this indicator should be treated with caution, because the allocation of budget items to<lb/> one of the sectors is not always clear, and some budget items can have multiple performers, in the<lb/> public as well as in the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>Main findings<lb/></head>

			<p>• In most countries institutional funding is the dominant funding source of the higher education<lb/> sector (50% or more). There are a few exceptions: Korea, Belgium and Australia.<lb/></p>

			<p>• This pattern is even stronger in the government sector. Only Korea has a share of institutional<lb/> funding that is less than 50%.<lb/> • These results should also be interpreted with some caution, particularly in the Canadian case<lb/> where all government performance was – due to lack of better data – allocated to institutional<lb/> funding.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 20<lb/></p>

			<head>Indicator 3: Public project funding to national performers by funding agency (source of funding)<lb/></head>

			<p>This indicator focuses on the part of GBAORD funding dedicated to national performers through<lb/> project funding. This indicator also includes project funding from abroad (international public project<lb/> funding to national performers). This indicator relates to funding modes (1) and (5) of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Relevance<lb/></head>

			<p>This indicator facilitates a better understanding of the decision-making process regarding the<lb/> allocation of R&amp;D funding at a project level. This type of information can be used in principle to inform<lb/> further work on funding models within a country&apos;s innovation policy mix, the analysis of shifts in the locus<lb/> of decision-making over time and comparisons between countries&apos; organisation of research funding and its<lb/> overall effectiveness.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definitions used<lb/></head>

			<p>Funding agencies, which are defined as agencies which allocate project funding, have been divided<lb/> into four general categories:<lb/> a) National government organisations with policy and funding responsibilities, such as research,<lb/> higher education or other ministries.<lb/> b) Sub-national authorities, such as states, regions or (significant) local authorities.<lb/> c) Independent agencies or agencies at arms-length, such as research councils or innovation<lb/> agencies. The following criteria were defined as possible criteria to identify these agencies:<lb/> having a well-defined budget (separated from the general state budget); a performance contract<lb/> with the state; the right to take the final decision on the projects; strategic autonomy in the<lb/> repartition of the budget between fields and activities.<lb/> d) Supra-national and international agencies, such as the European Commission.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data and results<lb/></head>

			<p>Data on this indicator are available for 15 countries. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> displays results on the various agencies<lb/> that are responsible for the allocation of R&amp;D project funding. The main distinction is between ministries<lb/> and independent agencies. For reasons of international comparability the figure is limited to national<lb/> funding agencies funding national performers only. Comparable data on funding from international sources<lb/> is not available for all countries and therefore excluded. These funding flows from abroad are not part of<lb/> GBAORD. The indicator also excludes national public funding to international organisations and other<lb/> funding of R&amp;D going abroad and excludes national public institutional funding to national performers.<lb/> Regarding the international funding flows, the availability and usefulness of other data sources could<lb/> be examined, such as the Annual Activity Reports of the EU (Directorate General for Research) in the case<lb/> of European countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Indicator 4: National public project funding to national performers by type of instrument<lb/></head>

			<p>This indicator focuses on the project funding component of GBAORD to national performers,<lb/> providing a breakdown by type of instrument as defined earlier, i.e. according to the main orientation<lb/> (type) of the instrument. The indicator focuses on project funding only and excludes institutional funding.<lb/> The reason is that institutional funding can also have different orientations, but that&apos;s not the purpose of<lb/> giving institutional funding. It gives the receiving organisation freedom to perform R&amp;D according to its<lb/> own mission and profile. The data collection also excludes funding from abroad. This indicator relates to<lb/> the funding mode (1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Relevance<lb/></head>

			<p>The government policies on public project funding, implemented via research programmes, can have<lb/> different orientations: academically oriented, policy oriented or innovation oriented. The main interest is to<lb/> identify what is the weight of the different orientations within each country, and whether there are<lb/> significant differences across countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definitions used<lb/></head>

			<p>Academic instruments; policy support instruments; innovation instruments; and national public<lb/> project funding to national performers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data and results<lb/></head>

			<p>Data on this indicator are available for ten countries. Several countries reported having problems in<lb/> allocating the budgets to one of the instrument types. Data for this indicator for reporting countries should<lb/> therefore be treated with caution and interpreted as global estimates, because of the subjective element in<lb/> the allocation decision. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the allocation of national public project funding to national<lb/> performers by three types of instruments. This indicator is restricted to national public funding sources of<lb/> R&amp;D. Funding to international performers is excluded.

But results should be treated and analysed<lb/> with care (see next section for more details). The primary purpose of the instrument is the leading<lb/> principle when categorising the funding (see Section 8.7.1 of the Frascati Manual). These should<lb/> be considered as broad definitions which need to be further tested and improved by the<lb/> participating countries.<lb/></table>

			<head>Indicator 5: International funding to national performers by sector of performance<lb/></head>

			<p>This indicator focuses on the funding from abroad and the sector where the R&amp;D is performed. It<lb/> relates to funding mode (5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Relevance<lb/></head>

			<p>Internationalisation, globalisation and international funding flows are also becoming more important<lb/> within the public funding domain. For example, trans-national co-operation and trans-national funding<lb/> flows are important elements of co-operation within the European Research Area (ERA). Public policies to<lb/> promote such cooperation have become an important feature of the European landscape, both at the<lb/> European Union level as well as at national level. In order to improve policies for the ERA, it is important<lb/> to know what amount of public budget involves trans-national flows in both outward and inward<lb/> directions. A first distinction concerning outward flows can be made between trans-national funding to<lb/> international research organisations with dedicated R&amp;D facilities (such as CERN, EMBL and ESO) and<lb/> other trans-national flows (for example based on bilateral agreements and development co-operation).<lb/> Other types of information relevant for understanding trans-national co-operation include the identity of<lb/> the organisations involved and the type of programmes in place. International collaboration mechanisms<lb/> involving state funding also apply to varying degrees of importance to other non-European countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another type of trans-national flow (inward) concerns project funding from international agencies to<lb/> national performers, which is of increasing importance for national R&amp;D performance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Findings<lb/></head>

			<p>• The data collection already showed that it is difficult for countries to collect these data. It was<lb/> discussed and accepted to drop this indicator and to limit the data collection to GBAORD data<lb/> only.<lb/> • Because data collection for this indicator was difficult in the context of this project, it is<lb/> suggested not to incorporate data collection on these funding flows in the project, but to design<lb/> separate projects on the issue of international funding flows. The results are of course<lb/> complementary.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data collection and methodological issues<lb/></head>

			<p>This section provides a general description of the way the different countries have collected the data<lb/> for their country, with further details available in Annex 3. For all countries participating in the project, the<lb/> national GBAORD database was the main source of data. However, in a number of cases, additional<lb/> information from administrative documents or from direct requests to other organisations was needed to<lb/> allocate the budget items properly to the different classifications as the national GBAORD database did not<lb/> contain all the necessary information.<lb/></p>

			<figure>DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 25<lb/></figure>

			<p>Throughout this phase of the project, a number of methodological issues and issues on definitions<lb/> were identified that require further clarification. Examples are the distinction between project and<lb/> institutional funding, the classification of funding by sector of performance, the classification of funding<lb/> agencies and the definition of instrument types. Work needs to be done to improve definitions and<lb/> classifications as well as to provide examples of &quot; difficult &quot; cases. Information should be collected in order<lb/> to see how the participating countries dealt with them. Although the questionnaire contained a number of<lb/> definitions and examples to assist participating countries in identifying different funding modes and<lb/> variables, some definitions were still found to be unclear, particularly for independent agencies and type of<lb/> instruments. The next paragraphs describe some of the priorities for further work to be done on definitions<lb/> and methodology.<lb/></p>

			<head>The distinction between project and institutional funding<lb/></head>

			<p>The distinction between project and institutional funding is one of the main significant contributions<lb/> of this project. Until now, the separation has not been part of the regular data collection of GBAORD. At<lb/> first sight, it seemed not to be too difficult for the participating countries to classify the GBAORD data<lb/> according to these two funding modes. In most cases, the required information was already included in the<lb/> data source. In some cases information from staff responsible for specific budget items or additional<lb/> background information was needed to make the necessary distinction. However, discussions with the<lb/> participating countries led to the conclusion that we need to specify the characteristics of institutional<lb/> funding, especially delineating the border with project funding. This relates to the question of the specific<lb/> locus of decision making about the funding into projects. Is it the government, the intermediary<lb/> organisations or the performing units?<lb/></p>

			<head>The classification of funding by sector of performance<lb/></head>

			<p>The experience with this indicator appears to be mixed. While some countries encountered no<lb/> methodological problems, others reported allocation problems in specific cases:<lb/> • The main issue arises when funding goes to multiple sectors or a network of researchers: to<lb/> which sector should the funding be allocated when the performers are located in multiple<lb/> sectors? 6 Should the funding be apportioned to the relevant sectors?<lb/> • Blurred borders between different sectors make it difficult to allocate some of the funding and the<lb/> sector of performance is not always easy to determine. For instance:<lb/> -<lb/>Distinguishing between non-for profit, business and higher education sector.<lb/> -<lb/></p>

			<p>The legal status of an institution receiving public funding may not necessarily be a good<lb/> descriptor of an institution&apos;s actual role, as in the case of institutes under ministerial control<lb/> but primarily providing services business enterprises. Should such an institute be classified<lb/> to the government sector or the business enterprise sector?<lb/></p>

			<table>DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 26<lb/> • Some countries raised the problem of allocating funds for intramural R&amp;D performed within<lb/> government. 7 For example, Canada allocated all government intramural R&amp;D to institutional<lb/> funding, because it was not possible to provide a satisfactory breakdown by type of funding. This<lb/> resulted in no project funding being identified as having been performed by the government<lb/> sector in Canada. For the next wave, clearer guidelines should be issued.<lb/></table>

			<p>In most of these cases, external information (administrative documents; annual reports of<lb/> organisations in the private sector; etc.) would be needed to better allocate funding to the right sector of<lb/> performance.<lb/></p>

			<head>The classification of project funding by funding agency<lb/></head>

			<p>In general, participating countries did not encounter major methodological difficulties (and most<lb/> countries gave examples of independent agencies in their country). However, the classification of project<lb/> funding by type of funding agency could be supported by clearer guidelines and definitions. It could be the<lb/> case that some of the large differences between countries can be explained by classification issues. For the<lb/> next wave of data collection, this issue will need to be addressed, for example by adding additional criteria<lb/> such as the existence of some kind of legal status, performance contracts, control mechanisms and the<lb/> location of the ultimate decision-making responsibility. It&apos;s also important to collect additional information<lb/> on independent agencies.<lb/></p>

			<head>The classification of project funding by instrument type<lb/></head>

			<p>Several countries faced issues with definition and budget allocation by instrument type. Subjective<lb/> judgments had to be used in combination with different assumptions.<lb/> • The proposed definitions were not detailed enough to make a clear distinction between instrument<lb/> type. For the next wave, this issue will need to be addressed.<lb/> • As in the case of the present GBAORD data collection, projects should be classified according to<lb/> the primary objective of the funding (see also Chapter 8.7 of the Frascati Manual).<lb/> • One way forward, although still a global way of classifying, would be to use the NABS<lb/> classification for defining categories. Items with the NABS-code &quot; industrial production &quot; could be<lb/> treated as innovation instruments, the items with the code &quot; advancement of knowledge &quot; could be<lb/> treated as academic instruments and the other as policy or thematic instruments. Another solution<lb/> would be to look from the perspective of the funding agency: research council (= academic),<lb/> innovation agency (= innovation), ministry of industry (= innovation), ministry of research<lb/> (= academic), other ministries (= policy or thematic), but this could be a too simple solution.<lb/></p>

			<p>The NESTI project on modes of public funding of R&amp;D was initiated with three general aims: &quot; a) to<lb/> propose a methodology for internationally comparable indicators on public funding modes; b) to collect<lb/> such indicators; c) to broaden the scope of the project beyond the scope of the participating countries, to<lb/> develop guidelines for the implementation of the methodology on a larger scale and on a permanent basis<lb/> as part of the regular indicator activities of the international organisations OECD and EUROSTAT. &quot; The<lb/> findings of this project could be used in a future revision of the GBAORD section of the OECD Frascati<lb/> Manual.<lb/></p>

			<p>From the results of this phase of the project, it is possible to draw a number of conclusions on the<lb/> adequateness of GBAORD as data source, the comparability of the new data and the results obtained so<lb/> far.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 27<lb/></p>

			<head>National GBAORD data can be used as a useful and potential source for data collection<lb/></head>

			<p>Seventeen out of the eighteen participating countries were able to build indicators by funding type<lb/> (institutional vs. project funding). Fifteen countries reported data concerning project funding agencies and<lb/> funding mode by sector of performance, and ten countries could report data on project funding by type of<lb/> instrument.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this –experimental– phase of the project, a large number of OECD countries participated. For a full<lb/> implementation of the data collection, participation and data from more countries would need to be<lb/> secured. The next project phase seeks to involve more countries in order to make a broader use of<lb/> GBAORD data, in full awareness that some countries articulated problems with adapting their data into the<lb/> new classifications.<lb/> Finally, the main advantage of this methodology is the use of existing data, which can, in some cases,<lb/> be relatively easily complemented with additional, relatively easy-to-access information.<lb/></p>

			<head>Complementary qualitative data is required to interpret results<lb/></head>

			<p>Collecting quantitative data on public funding is not sufficient to enable their interpretation. Based on<lb/> the data collected it is difficult to assess the reasons behind the differences between countries. For<lb/> example, it is not clear how the large differences between countries with regard to the share of project<lb/> funding should be interpreted alongside qualitative information on funding policies of R&amp;D, on funding<lb/> systems, funding agencies, funding mechanisms and funding practices as both a test of and complement to<lb/> the new quantitative indicators on funding patterns.<lb/></p>

			<head>A basic level of international comparability appears to be attainable<lb/></head>

			<p>Participating countries were sufficiently confident about the reliability of their data for it be published<lb/> and presented subject to the adequate health warnings. The publication &quot; Measuring innovation: A new<lb/> perspective &quot; (OECD, 2010b) made use of the results of the exercise and published two figures based on<lb/> these GBAORD-based indicators: one with government budgets by national sector of performance<lb/> (indicator 3) and the other government funded R&amp;D in higher education by type of funding (also<lb/> indicator 3).<lb/> The exercise has so far revealed the potential of using existing data on public funding for the<lb/> development and construction of a number of policy relevant indicators on public funding. The results<lb/> should however still be treated as preliminary. Improvements are likely to follow as the methodology is<lb/> tested across a large number of countries and the resulting data are analysed alongside qualitative and other<lb/> complementary data sources.<lb/></p>

Beneficiaries of public funding<lb/> may in some cases outsource some of the R&amp;D to third parties that may belong to a different sector, for<lb/> example in the case of business beneficiaries that procure R&amp;D services from higher education or public<lb/> research institutes.

No<lb/> other data sources.<lb/> Distinction<lb/> project/<lb/> institutional<lb/></table>

			<p>Based on the stated programme objectives. For institutional funding, the criteria are that the funding<lb/> is provided as a block funding to a unit that has been established as an independent legal entity<lb/> through an Act of Parliament (Federal or State) or established through a formal legal process and the<lb/> entity is free to allocate the funding to different priorities according to its governance procedures.<lb/> This is mostly the case for the publicly funded research agencies and the university sector. The<lb/> exception is where the independent agency, which has been established by an Act of Parliament, is<lb/> charged with distributing the appropriated monies to external parties to support research of limited<lb/> scope and duration e.g. research councils. In this instance, the entire amount is classed as Project.<lb/> For project funding, the criteria are that the scope and duration of the funding are limited,<lb/> irrespective of characteristic of recipient.<lb/> Problems<lb/> No major difficulties in collecting the data<lb/> Main<lb/> independent<lb/> funding<lb/> agencies<lb/></p>

			<p>The two main independent funding agencies are the:</p>

			<head>Australian Research Council and the National<lb/> Health and Medical Research Council<lb/> Problems /<lb/> issues<lb/></head>

			<p>There may be other state agencies, but the main ones are listed in the table<lb/></p>

			<p>Performers<lb/> by<lb/> institutional<lb/> sector<lb/> Sectoral attribution is by destination or recipient of the funding. The two problems encountered are<lb/> where there are multiple sectors involved or where it is not clear which institutional sector a recipient<lb/> should be assigned to (e.g. legal structure versus function). While some entities may be incorporated<lb/> under the Corporations <ref type="biblio">Act (2001)</ref>, it may depend on other legal arrangements regarding their<lb/> classification for tax purposes as well as the proportion of private versus public funding. The other<lb/> relevant legislation is the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act (1997). These factors may<lb/> complicate the allocation. Agencies have been asked to prorate the appropriations by institutional<lb/> sector where funding recipients belong to multiple sectors following the recommendations of the<lb/> Frascati Manual as closely as possible. Where agencies are able to identify the percentage<lb/> distributions, these are applied in the distribution. Where the breakdown is not available, roughly<lb/> equal proportions are applied.<lb/> Projects by<lb/> type of<lb/> instruments<lb/></p>

			<p>The definition of the instrument types is somewhat difficult to interpret. Funding intentions<lb/> corresponding to the &apos;Academic Instrument&apos; could be more easily identified but distributions<lb/> according to instrument types were based on assumptions i.e. funding intentions had to be translated<lb/> into their equivalents in terms of &apos;instruments&apos;. The test for the &apos;Innovation Instrument&apos; is whether<lb/> the programme objectives satisfy the Oslo Manual definition of innovation.<lb/></p>

			<table>Austria<lb/> Data source<lb/> GBAORD. Final for 2000 and 2005, provisional for 2009 (i.e. the latest available year).<lb/> Distinction<lb/> project/<lb/> institutional<lb/></table>

			<p>No distinction is made between the two &quot; funding modes &quot; in Annex T. Many budget items can be<lb/> categorized relatively easily (as they are easily identifiable), some budget items need closer<lb/> investigation by studying further background documents containing more details.<lb/> Problems<lb/> The distinction is for some items difficult without additional background information. National<lb/> research funding agencies are considered as project funding. Data do not necessarily relate to the<lb/> funds these agencies provide yearly (autonomy).<lb/></p>

			<table>DSTI/DOC(2012)4<lb/> 37<lb/> Main<lb/> independent<lb/> funding<lb/> agencies<lb/> For the moment two main independent agencies are identified: &quot; Research Promotion Agency &quot; (FFG)<lb/> which mainly funds business R&amp;D and the &quot; Science Funds &quot; (FWF), which mainly funds R&amp;D in the<lb/> higher education sector. The &quot; Klima-und Energiefonds &quot; plays (up to now) a small role.<lb/> Problems /<lb/> issues<lb/> No major problems (difference between GBAORD outlays and actual outlays of institutions).<lb/> Performers<lb/> by<lb/> institutional<lb/> sector<lb/></table>

			<p>Similar problems as the distinction between &quot; institutional funding &quot; and &quot; project funding &quot; occur. For<lb/> many budget items the recipients can be categorised very easily, for others it is difficult. Additional<lb/> information sources are used to estimate the distribution of certain items to the various sectors of<lb/> performance.<lb/> Projects by<lb/> type of<lb/> instruments<lb/></p>

			<p>Budgetary items would have to be labelled similarly to the methodology used for <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. However,<lb/> there is not enough information available for the various budget items to make an attribution of<lb/> reasonable quality.<lb/> Belgium<lb/> Data source<lb/> GBAORD.

			<p>Problems occur especially when trying to detail project funding. The destination of project funding to<lb/> the different sectors is not always clear because of a combination of different sectors involved. Only<lb/> when a project register should be made, this could solve the problems. So, for the moment a rough<lb/> distinction is made of those budget items with multiple destinations.<lb/> Flemish government: for many funds (about 50 of a total of 175) of the Flemish GBAORD, the<lb/> sectors of performance are only known in the course of the budget year. For the Flemish government,<lb/> the expenditure analysis was consulted to find out which sectors executed the projects.<lb/> Projects by<lb/> type of<lb/> instruments<lb/> A best-guess approach was applied. The difficulty between policy instruments and innovation<lb/> instruments is not always clear. Better definitions seem to be necessary (because of an overlap in the<lb/> definitions). Innovation instruments are in principal not part of GBAORD. ESA and Airbus are<lb/> typical examples of being both innovative instruments and policy or thematic instruments.<lb/> Flemish Government: no major problems encountered, because the existing explanatory notes of the<lb/> different funds give the answer. Although in some cases consultation of the expenditure analysis was<lb/> necessary.<lb/></p>

Canada GBAORD as published by the OECD is also for central<lb/> government only.

For<lb/> government funding in-house R&amp;D, it is not possible to get a better breakdown<lb/> Problems<lb/> In Canada, government R&amp;D funding is decentralized. More than 40 different departments/agencies<lb/> are reporting R&amp;D funding. It was not possible to ask each department to provide a list/breakdown of<lb/> project vs. institutional funding. However, assumption was made depending on who (which<lb/> department) provided the funds, and to whom (performer). In general, funding in higher education<lb/> (from research councils) and in business sector is allocated through R&amp;D research project (project-<lb/>based funding).<lb/> For intramural R&amp;D, it was not possible to provide a satisfactory breakdown. All in-house R&amp;D was<lb/> then allocated to institutional funding.<lb/> For other performers (private non profit; other performers) total funding is small and was allocated to<lb/> institutional funding.<lb/> Main<lb/> independent<lb/> funding<lb/> agencies<lb/> There are three main research councils (independent agency providing funds to higher-education<lb/> sector) and one agency providing R&amp;D infrastructure fund to higher-education sector:<lb/> -Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<lb/> -Canadian Institutes of Health Research<lb/> -Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada<lb/> -Canada Foundation for Innovation (R&amp;D infrastructure fund)<lb/> These four agencies provide around 95% of all government direct funding (excluding GUF) to higher<lb/> education sector, and almost all of that funding is distributed by project-funding.<lb/> Problems /<lb/> issues<lb/> Performers<lb/> by<lb/> institutional<lb/> sector<lb/></table>

			<p>The main problem is for in-house government R&amp;D where all funding was allocated to institutional<lb/> funding. There is no central S&amp;T ministry in Canada that would provide R&amp;D funding to different<lb/> ministries. Each ministry is responsible of his own R&amp;D and from a total budget they will decide<lb/> how much to spend in R&amp;D to fulfil their mission. No more information is available. This is why it<lb/> was decided to allocate all the in-house R&amp;D as institutional.<lb/> Projects by<lb/> type of<lb/> instruments<lb/> Project funding to businesses was allocated to innovation.
