			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>This study analyses linkages between trade and innovation in the chemicals sector, building on past <lb/>work at the OECD on trade and innovation. The chemicals sector has a long history of innovation and is a <lb/>large trading item. It covers very diverse sub-sectors. This paper analyses and compares different trade and <lb/>innovation linkages in basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals. <lb/>This sector has also been a subject of successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, and partly <lb/>as a consequence tariff rates have been reduced over time. Nonetheless remaining tariffs are still <lb/>non-negligible and constitute impediments to trade. Export restrictive measures on raw material inputs are <lb/>also being highlighted on the trade negotiating agenda. Moreover, the chemicals sector is heavily regulated <lb/>for health and environmental reasons and further legislative initiatives have been pursued, whose practical <lb/>impact on innovation remains to be seen. Intellectual property has played a very important role in <lb/>technology diffusion in this sector, and infringement of intellectual property continues to be a major <lb/>problem. <lb/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <lb/>This study has been prepared by Nobuo Kiriyama of the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate <lb/>with a contribution by Paul Wright as an external consultant for the study, under the supervision of Dale <lb/>Andrew, Head of the Trade Policy Linkages and Services Division.

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>The chemicals industry has a long history of innovation as &quot; the first science-based industry &quot; . It <lb/>occupies a large part of international trade and has continuously been the subject of multilateral trade <lb/>negotiations. It is undergoing a major transformation with the rise of emerging economies and regulatory <lb/>challenges. <lb/>World trade in the chemicals sector more than trebled between 1995 and 2008, particularly just <lb/>after 2001. While high income countries represent the majority of world trade, low and middle income <lb/>countries are steadily gaining importance, and South-South trade has recorded higher growth rates than <lb/>other income group pairs. Emerging economies, such as China, are now among the major traders in this <lb/>sector. Three quarters of world trade in the chemicals sector is in intermediate goods, and consumer <lb/>chemicals and pharmaceuticals make up the rest. Tariffs have been reduced substantially over the same <lb/>period, but their elimination remains as a subject in the current multilateral negotiations. <lb/>Different sub-segments of the industry, i.e. basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals <lb/>and consumer chemicals all have very diverse innovation characteristics. Basic industrial chemicals have <lb/>limited opportunities to introduce new products and compete mainly on costs, whereas product innovation, <lb/>responding to evolving customer needs transmitted through supply chains, is essential for speciality and <lb/>fine chemicals. Process innovation is important for both of these sub-sectors to reduce costs, to improve <lb/>sustainability (e.g. industrial biotechnology) or to pursue differentiation. For consumer chemicals <lb/>introduction of new products and marketing approaches is the key. These different features of those sub-<lb/>segments offer diverse channels through which trade affects innovation in the chemicals sector. First, the <lb/>transfer of advanced technologies, both as embodied in capital goods as well as through technology <lb/>licensing, has been the key to the emergence of the chemicals industry as a global industry, and the <lb/>specialised engineering firms (SEFs) have played a unique role, especially in basic industrial chemicals. <lb/>Second, product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals contributes to innovation in downstream <lb/>sectors, and trade serves as an essential conduit to transmit such innovations across borders. Thirdly, as a <lb/>consequence of the wider availability of technologies across the globe, technology leaders in developed <lb/>countries are under increasing competitive pressure from new competitors, which induces further <lb/>innovation. Fourth, foreign contacts through exports can give suppliers innovative ideas. The increasing <lb/>strength of emerging markets is a challenge but it also offers opportunities for innovation. Finally, joint <lb/>ventures and cross border M&amp;A also function as channels of technology transfer. <lb/>The chemicals sector is heavily regulated both domestically and internationally, primarily for health, <lb/>safety and environmental reasons. Under WTO rules, regulations may be considered legitimate if certain <lb/>conditions are met. Many domestic regulations have been notified to the WTO according to the procedure <lb/>provided in the TBT Agreement, and there have been over 1 600 notifications since 1995 in the chemicals <lb/>sector. The impact of regulation on innovation can go either way; on one hand, regulation imposes extra <lb/>cost and time burdens and diverts resources away from innovation, but on the other hand, environmental <lb/>regulation can induce innovative activities and enhance energy efficiency. The actual impact of regulation <lb/>on innovation is likely to be specific to the regulatory design and to the products and segments of the <lb/>industry. The impact of recently introduced REACH legislation in the EU has been much discussed both in <lb/>the legislative process within the EU and in international forums including the WTO. Beyond the EU, <lb/>many major players in this sector have been pursuing regulatory initiatives to enhance data collection and <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>to extend regulatory coverage to existing chemicals. Their practical impact remains to be seen, since they <lb/>are still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In relation to climate change issues, the <lb/>chemicals sector is in a unique position as both a major sector in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions <lb/>and as a major contributor to delivering solutions to combat climate change. Technological solutions to <lb/>reduce reliance on fossil fuels by the chemicals sector are being sought, and chemical products are <lb/>essential for greenhouse gas reduction in downstream industries. Further trade liberalisation can play an <lb/>important role to accelerate the diffusion of products and technologies that contribute to climate change <lb/>mitigation. <lb/>Intellectual property has particular importance in the chemicals sector because of the relative ease of <lb/>producing chemicals as soon as the necessary technologies are known. Throughout the history of the <lb/>chemicals industry, both patents and trade secrets have been used extensively to protect intellectual <lb/>property, the choice depending on the nature of the technology and company strategy. Patents have been <lb/>instrumental in facilitating technology transfer by licensing. The practice of co-patenting is generally <lb/>correlated with trade flows, indicating the possibility that collaborative efforts in innovation foster trade <lb/>flows, or that trade flows and collaborative innovation are mutually reinforcing. Infringement of <lb/>intellectual property continues to be a major problem resulting in large losses to the intellectual property <lb/>holders. Many multinational companies operating in China have taken various measures to protect their <lb/>intellectual property, over and above efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement by the <lb/>Chinese government. In addition, counterfeiting of chemical products (e.g. fertilisers and pesticides), <lb/>which is often difficult to detect, can have serious consequences for the environment, health and safety. <lb/>During the recent financial crisis, the chemicals industry has been no exception in experiencing a <lb/>decline in trade. Although it is considered that the initial fear of possible serious protectionist reactions has <lb/>not materialised, chemicals and plastics are among the most affected industries by recently introduced <lb/>trade-related measures. The recent developments underline the importance of the monitoring activities to <lb/>ensure transparency and to seek an ambitious and balanced conclusion of the Doha Development Round. <lb/></body>

			<body>I. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>1. Background and the purpose of the study <lb/>1. <lb/>The Trade Committee&apos;s work on Trade and Innovation in 2007-2008 (OECD, 2008a) highlighted <lb/>various linkages between trade and innovation, drawing on case studies of various sectors in countries at <lb/>different levels of development. Building on this, a first sectoral study has been undertaken focusing on the <lb/>information and communication technology (ICT) sector. 1 This second sectoral study focuses on the <lb/>chemicals sector. <lb/>2. <lb/>There are several reasons for the choice of this sector. First, the chemicals sector (HS Chapters <lb/>28-39) occupies over 11% of the world trade, and it has been a specific subject of multilateral trade <lb/>negotiations. Second, it has a long tradition of innovation as &quot; the first science-based industry &quot; , and <lb/>development and diffusion of technology has played an essential role in shaping the industry. Moreover, <lb/>emerging economies and major regulatory issues relating particularly to health, safety and environment are <lb/>changing the industry. Thus, there are unique issues to explore in the chemicals sector in relation to trade <lb/>and innovation. <lb/>3. <lb/>This paper is in five sections. The remainder of this section briefly introduces the concept of <lb/>innovation and its contribution to trade, and discusses the scope of the chemicals sector covered in this <lb/>paper. Section II reviews the evolution of trade and tariff profiles of the sector over the past ten years. <lb/>Section III examines trade and innovation linkages focusing on three chemicals sub-sectors. Section IV <lb/>discusses trade-related policy measures in the chemicals sector, and Section V concludes. <lb/>2. Trade and innovation: an overview <lb/>i) Innovation <lb/>4. <lb/>OECD (2005, p.46) ( &quot; the Oslo Manual &quot; ) 2 defines an innovation as the implementation of a new <lb/>or significantly improved product (good or services), or process, a new marketing method, or a new <lb/>organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations (. It is a <lb/>continuous process that involves multiple aspects of firm activities. <lb/>5. <lb/>Four types of innovations are distinguished: product innovations, process innovations, marketing <lb/>innovations and organisational innovations. A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service <lb/>that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. A process <lb/>innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. A <lb/>marketing innovation is the implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in <lb/>product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing. An organisational <lb/>innovation is the implementation of a new organisational method in the firm&apos;s business practices, <lb/>workplace organisation or external relations. (Oslo Manual, pp.47-51) All innovations must contain a <lb/>degree of novelty, which can be new to the firm, new to the market or new to the world (ibid, p.57). <lb/>*This study is prepared with a contribution from Paul Wright, external consultant to this study. <lb/>1 . <lb/> &quot; Trade in ICT and its contribution to trade and innovation &quot; , [TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART1; <lb/>TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART1/ANN and TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART2] <lb/>2 <lb/>The Oslo manual presents guidelines for collecting data on the general process of innovation, the <lb/>implementation of innovations, the factors that influence innovation activities, and the outcomes of <lb/>innovation.

			<body>ii) Contribution of trade to innovation <lb/>6. <lb/>Just as the concept of an innovation is multifaceted, the contribution of trade to innovation <lb/>involves various channels. 3 As highlighted in OECD (2008a), technologies can move across borders <lb/>through trade and investment as well as through licensing. Imports of capital goods are an important <lb/>conduit for technology transfer as foreign-produced machinery often contains more technology than <lb/>domestic machinery, especially in developing countries. Foreign direct investment also plays a key role in <lb/>technology transfer and innovation. Multinational companies tend to innovate more than domestic <lb/>companies, and there is also a growing recognition that internationalising production can be a way of <lb/>gaining access to expertise and techniques that are complementary to a company&apos;s in-house assets. Second, <lb/>imports and foreign direct investment both increase competition for domestic industries, which creates an <lb/>incentive for firms to innovate in order to withstand competitive pressure. Empirical evidence suggests that, <lb/>in high-technology industries, levels of innovation fall more rapidly when there is less competition. Third, <lb/>globalisation of value chains, which itself is a type of innovation, may induce participating firms to <lb/>improve efficiency in individual activities, to change their mix of activities, or to try to innovate by moving <lb/>into another value chain (OECD (2008a), pp.14-42). <lb/>7. <lb/>Openness to trade is, needless to say, not an instrument specifically designed to foster innovation, <lb/>but it is one element of the framework conditions that affects broader aspects of the economy. As often <lb/>emphasised, openness to trade (or more generally the right framework condition) on its own does not <lb/>ensure innovation (or other desirable economic outcomes), 4 and given the increasingly central role of <lb/>innovation in delivering a wide range of economic and social objectives, a &quot; whole-of-government &quot; <lb/>approach to policies for innovation is needed (OECD, 2010a). Nevertheless, as summarised above, <lb/>openness to trade is an essential condition that facilitates, or enables, diffusion of technologies for a <lb/>broader range of firms across the border to take up and innovate, and gives the right incentive for firms to <lb/>innovate. This study examines how these channels work in the chemicals sector. <lb/>3. The scope of the chemicals sector and the nature of innovation <lb/>8. <lb/>The chemicals sector comprises a series of diverse and inter-related sub-sectors covering a wide <lb/>range of technologies and processes. The output of the industry is mostly used by other companies as <lb/>inputs, but it also covers finished goods used by consumers. Chemical inputs are essential to many <lb/>different industries, not only to the chemical industry itself, or to other manufacturing industries such as <lb/>automotives, electronics and textiles, but also to agriculture and services. 5 In order to properly take into <lb/>account the diversity of this sector, it is useful to introduce certain sub-groupings within the industry. For <lb/>this purpose, this paper makes reference to &quot; basic industrial chemicals &quot; , &quot; speciality and fine chemicals &quot; , <lb/> &quot; consumer chemicals &quot; and &quot; pharmaceuticals &quot; as sub-sectors. 6 Basic industrial chemicals cover inorganic <lb/>and organic chemicals as well as petrochemicals and fertilisers, which are typically produced on a large <lb/>scale. Speciality and fine chemicals are medium to high value products and produced on a smaller scale. <lb/>3 <lb/>See OECD (2008a), Tables 1 and 2. <lb/>4 <lb/>Speeches by Pascal Lamy, Director General of the WTO, &quot; Facts and Fictions in International Trade <lb/>Economics &quot; (12 April 2010, at the Paris School of Economics), &quot; Reconciling America with an open <lb/>trading system &quot; (24 April 2009, in Washington, D.C.), <lb/>5 <lb/>CEFIC (2009), p.8; ICCA (2005), p.4. In one estimate, 96% of manufactured goods have a direct nexus to <lb/>the chemicals sector (Durbin, 2009). <lb/>6 <lb/>HLG (2009) uses largely similar divisions: petrochemicals, basic inorganics and polymers; speciality <lb/>chemicals; and consumer chemicals (pp.6-7). Thomson Reuters Business Classification divides Chemicals <lb/>(under Basic Materials) into Commodity Chemicals, Agricultural Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals and <lb/>Diversified Chemicals. See also Swift (1999), p.33; OECD (2001), p.10. <lb/></body>

			<body>They include paints and pigments, industrial gasses, sealants and adhesives and catalysts, but some organic <lb/>chemicals and plastics can also belong to this category. Consumer chemicals are in general formulated <lb/>products such as soap, detergents and cosmetics. Together (including pharmaceuticals) they nearly <lb/>correspond to the coverage of the Chemicals Tariff Harmonization Agreement (CTHA) in the Uruguay <lb/>Round. <lb/>9. <lb/>It should be noted that the boundaries of the sub-sectors are fluid and not always clear-cut, and <lb/>statistics are not necessarily suited to capturing these different segments (Swift (1999), p.33). Adding to <lb/>this, &quot; chemicals &quot; in different studies may actually refer to a varying scope of products; in particular, <lb/>pharmaceuticals are often, but not always, treated as a separate industry, and consumer chemicals are <lb/>sometimes excluded, either explicitly or implicitly. 7 This paper does not specifically focus on <lb/>pharmaceuticals in its analysis of trade and innovation linkage in Sections III and IV, since it is quite <lb/>distinct in terms of both trade and innovation performances (see Section II and Section III.1) and may well <lb/>merit a specific study in its own right. 8 <lb/>II. <lb/>Trade and tariffs in the chemicals sector <lb/>1. Evolution of trade 9 <lb/>10. <lb/>World trade in the chemicals sector (defined as HS Chapters 28 to 39 in this Section; 10 see <lb/>Table 1 for descriptions) more than trebled between 1995 and 2008 (Figure 1). While high income <lb/>countries (HICs) have the largest share in world trade, low and middle income countries (LMICs) have <lb/>been steadily gaining market share during this period. Taking a closer look at the differences by sub-sector <lb/>and by income group provides further insight. First, whereas the annual growth rates in chemicals <lb/>(excluding pharmaceuticals) have been similar to those in total merchandise trade, the growth rates in <lb/>pharmaceuticals (Chapter 30) have been quite different. 11 The growth in pharmaceuticals was notably <lb/>higher in HICs, compared with other HS Chapters. In contrast, the growth in fertilisers (Chapter 31) was <lb/>particularly higher in LMICs (Figure 2). Second, in terms of levels of trade, there is a high concentration <lb/>on organic chemicals and plastics (HS Chapters 29 and 39; generally considered basic industrial <lb/>chemicals), followed by pharmaceuticals, which together account for 70% of trade in chemicals (Figure 3). <lb/>The composition of trade is different between the HICs and the LMICs, with trade in pharmaceuticals <lb/>strongly concentrated in the former, with inorganic chemicals and fertilisers more concentrated in the latter <lb/>group. <lb/>11. <lb/>Trade in chemicals between LMICs (South-South trade) has been low but steadily increasing <lb/>from 5% in 1995 to close to 10% in 2008; in turn, the share of trade between HICs, while still dominant, <lb/>has gradually declined from over 70% to 60% during the same period (Figure 4). Trade between LMICs <lb/>has recorded faster overall growth in the chemicals than other income group pairs during the period, with <lb/>the notable exception of pharmaceuticals. Plastics and organic chemicals together account for 40-50% of <lb/>increased growth after 2001 across different income group pairs, while pharmaceuticals was by far the <lb/>7 <lb/>See e.g. Swift (1999), p.33 (explicitly excludes consumer products from the discussion); Thomson Reuters <lb/>Business Classification (establishes Personal &amp; Household Products separate from chemicals). <lb/>8 <lb/>See e.g. OECD (2006). <lb/>9 <lb/>See Appendix 1 for technical details of the data. <lb/>10 <lb/>This coverage is in reference to the CTHA. However, it contains some headings covered by the Agreement <lb/>on Agriculture thus not covered by the CTHA or current proposal on liberalisation of tariffs in chemicals <lb/>sector in the Doha round. <lb/>11 <lb/>WTO (2005a), pp.17-18 investigates into the possible reasons for sharp growth of trade in pharmaceutical <lb/>sector, and it attributes to strong demand and industrial restructuring as a major factor. <lb/></body>

			<body>largest contributor to trade between HICs. Pharmaceuticals are also the largest trading item between HICs, <lb/>while trade in fertilisers is mainly between LMICs. The largest trade item between the two income groups <lb/>is plastics, followed by organic chemicals. <lb/>12. <lb/>The largest traders are the EU (external trade as a group), Germany and the United States, <lb/>followed by Belgium, France and China (Figure 5). Here again, significant acceleration of growth in the <lb/>2000s can be seen across countries. The composition of exports varies considerably between countries; <lb/>many OECD countries have high shares in pharmaceuticals (except Japan and Korea) alongside India, <lb/>while many East Asian economies (Korea; Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong, China) are more specialised in <lb/>plastics. <lb/>13. <lb/>Classifying in terms of end use, intermediate goods (industry supplies and others) make up for <lb/>three-quarters of trade (Figure 6). This concentration in intermediate goods is even higher for the LMICs. <lb/>The most noticeable change between 2000 and 2007 was the increase in the share of pharmaceuticals, <lb/>especially in the HICs. Despite a significant increase in the absolute value of trade in other types of <lb/>chemicals, the shares of intermediate goods (except exports from the LMICs) and consumer chemicals <lb/>(other than pharmaceuticals; e.g. perfume, cosmetics, soap and plastic articles) declined during this period. <lb/>Table 1.

Tariff profiles in the chemicals sector <lb/>14. <lb/>Tariff rates have been coming down since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (Figure 7(a)). <lb/>The average MFN applied tariffs on chemicals by the original CTHA (Chemicals Tariff Harmonization <lb/>Agreement) participants are about 2%, and non-participants have also reduced their rates from over 10% to <lb/>single digits. This reduction is not necessarily due to the implementation of commitments under the WTO <lb/>(Uruguay Round commitment or accession commitment) but includes unilateral tariff reduction, especially <lb/>by non-CTHA participants. Therefore, despite a certain degree of convergence of tariff rates across <lb/>12 <lb/>Although this structure does not precisely correspond to the sub-groupings used in this paper, CEFIC <lb/>(2009), p.18, uses the following categorisation: &quot; basic inorganic &quot; (28, 31), &quot; petrochemicals (29), polymers <lb/>(39, 54, 55), &quot; pharmaceuticals &quot; (30), &quot; specialty chemicals &quot; (32, 35, 38) and &quot; consumer chemicals &quot; (33, 34). <lb/></body>

			<body>countries, levels of WTO bound rates in non-participants are considerably higher than other groups (Figure <lb/>7(b)). Tariff reduction has taken place across different HS Chapters, but tariff rates are generally lower for <lb/>basic chemicals (Chapters 28-29) and higher for more highly processed chemical products (Chapters 33-36) <lb/>(Figure 8). 13 This reflects the structure of CTHA, but it is also the case with non-participants. <lb/>15. <lb/>An estimate of the amount of duties collected on imports shows that the largest amount is <lb/>collected by non-CTHA participants, despite tariff reductions in recent years (Table 2). It also shows that <lb/>the duty collection by original CTHA participants and new WTO members also remains substantial, due to <lb/>large import value as well as to the remaining tariffs. It is worth noting, however, that whereas tariffs for <lb/>CTHA participants are bound at levels close to applied tariffs, tariffs for non-CTHA participants are bound <lb/>at much higher levels and can be raised by their policy decisions. <lb/>16. <lb/>A breakdown into HS Chapters shows that plastics represent the largest share of duty collection, <lb/>followed by organic chemicals. The share of pharmaceuticals is significantly higher in non-CTHA <lb/>countries (Table 2). <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Box 1. The Chemicals Sector and Multilateral Trade Negotiations <lb/>The chemical sector has been featured during successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations. During the <lb/>Dillon Round (1960-61), European countries made their tariff reductions on organic chemicals conditional on the <lb/>abolition of the American Selling Price system of valuation for customs purposes (ASP) by the United States, but no <lb/>agreement was reached. In the Kennedy Round (1964-67), European countries made their offers on the entire <lb/>chemicals sector (Chapters 28 to 39) conditional on the abolition of the ASP. Informal groups were established in five <lb/>sectors, including chemicals, to deal with the sector specific problems (GATT, 1975a). The negotiations resulted in a <lb/>formal plurilateral &quot; agreement &quot; on chemicals <lb/>15 (WTO (2005b), para. 14). During the Tokyo Round (1973-79), the <lb/>Negotiating Group &quot; Sectoral Approach &quot; was established and worked on various sectors including chemicals, <lb/>16 but it <lb/>produced no agreement on the sector on a plurilateral basis. <lb/>The Uruguay Round (1986-94) produced several successful plurilateral sectoral negotiations, including the <lb/>chemicals tariff harmonisation agreement (CTHA) and the tariff elimination ( &quot; zero-for-zero &quot; agreement) in <lb/>pharmaceuticals (WTO (2005b), para.27). Initially, contracting parties interested in particular sectors indicated those <lb/>sectors in their tariff reduction proposals in 1990-91, which was followed by negotiations (Stewart et al. (1995), pp.414-<lb/>43). In July 1993, the United States, European Communities, Canada and Japan announced an agreement on <lb/>necessary elements for a final agreement, which included a common list of sectors for tariff and non-tariff measure <lb/>elimination (e.g. pharmaceuticals) and tariff harmonisation in chemical products (GATT, 1993). Under the CTHA it was <lb/>agreed to harmonise and bind the tariff rates at 6.5% (HS Chapters 31-39 and 2916-2942), 5.5% (HS28 and 2903-14) <lb/>and 0% (HS2901-2902 and HS30) with 5, 10 or 15 years of staging depending on the base tariff levels (WTO, 2006; <lb/>WTO, 2005), except for products covered by the Agreement on Agriculture. This agreement initially had the following <lb/>participants: Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities (12), Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, Slovak <lb/>Republic, Switzerland and the United States (Hoda, 2002, p.30). Many more countries have since subscribed to the <lb/>same or similar commitments in particular the recently acceded members to the WTO as a part of their accession <lb/>commitments. <lb/>On pharmaceuticals, it was agreed to eliminate tariffs on items in HS Chapter 30; items in HS headings 2936, <lb/>2937, 2939, and 2941, with the exception of dihydrostreptomycin and salts, esters, and hydrates thereof; and other <lb/>items including active ingredients which bear an international non-proprietary name (INN) from the World Health <lb/>Organization, and certain additional products used for the production and manufacture of finished pharmaceuticals. <lb/>The participants were Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities (12), Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, <lb/>Norway, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Switzerland and the United States (GATT, 1994). There have been three rounds <lb/>of reviews of the product coverage, which resulted in inclusion of additional products (WTO 1996, 1998, 2007). <lb/>In the current Doha Development Agenda negotiations (2001-), proposals have been tabled for sectoral tariff <lb/>elimination in the chemicals sector (Chapters 28-39) and for open access to enhanced healthcare (Chapter 30 as well <lb/>as some items from other Chapters including Chapters 28, 29, 87 and 90) (WTO, 2008). <lb/>17 <lb/>15 <lb/>Agreement relating principally to Chemicals, Supplementary to the Geneva (1967) Protocol (GATT, <lb/>L/2819, 17 July 1967). <lb/>16 <lb/>For example, in the process of the work in the Group &quot; Sectoral Approach &quot; , the United States proposed <lb/>further studies on the chemicals, electronics, and heavy electrical equipment sectors (GATT, 1975b). <lb/></body>

			<body>III. <lb/>Innovation in the chemicals sector and the role of trade <lb/>1. Innovation activities in the chemicals sector <lb/>i) A short history of innovation in the chemicals sector <lb/>17. <lb/>The chemical industry 18 has a long history of innovation. It started in the first half of the <lb/>nineteenth century as mostly processing of inorganic chemical compounds taken from the earth into more <lb/>useful products such as lime and soda ashes. The chemical industry was made &quot; the first science-based <lb/>industry &quot; with the launch of organic chemistry in 1856 in Britain, in which inputs such as coal and oil are <lb/>transformed into benzene, ethylene and so on. In particular the production of dyestuffs became the engine <lb/>of growth until WWI, especially in Germany. The advent of polymer chemistry in Germany in the 1920s <lb/>opened the door for the petrochemicals industry, developed initially in the United States, contributing to <lb/>large scale production of a diverse range of polymer products such as synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives <lb/>and paints. A third stage of technological changes is taking place based on the advent of biosciences. <lb/>18. <lb/>Basic production technologies were diffused geographically over the twentieth century, initially <lb/>among the United States, Europe and Japan and subsequently in Asia and the Middle East. Competitive <lb/>pressure has pushed the industry to restructure, especially in developed countries, moving away from a <lb/>conglomerate structure with physically integrated assets and moving to the areas of core competence and <lb/>product differentiation, often through divestment, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Re-organisations of <lb/>existing companies as well as the emergence of new entrants (SABIC, Sinopec) have made the top 10 <lb/>chemical companies list considerably different over the past 10 years (Table 3). 19 It is predicted that <lb/>by 2015 there will be only four top-ten producers in developed countries (KPMG International (2010a), <lb/>p.9). <lb/>19. <lb/>The recent financial crisis has hit the sector in varying degrees depending on the fortunes of the <lb/>downstream users, with the chemicals for automotive and construction industry being hit the hardest, and <lb/>those for pharmaceuticals, food and personal care being hit the least. Nevertheless, the economic downturn <lb/>has generally reinforced the need for further innovation in accordance with the key competitive advantage <lb/>of the business segment. In doing so, wider range of collaboration across the boundary of the firms in <lb/>various activities, including R&amp;D, distribution and marketing, is being called for. In a larger context, the <lb/>financial crisis is considered to accelerate the shift in the centre of gravity of the industry to the emerging <lb/>economies, as companies with cost advantages and better financial positions in the aftermath of the <lb/>financial crisis expand their businesses. 20 <lb/>18 <lb/>This and the following paragraphs draws on Landau and Arora (1999), Swift (1999) and Cesaroni et al. <lb/>(2004), pp.125-131. <lb/>19 <lb/>See Engman et al. (2006), pp.101-134 for a comparative study of structural adjustment focusing on the <lb/>petrochemicals sector in major producing countries. <lb/></body>

A study on innovation performance ranking of European industries put &quot; chemicals and chemical <lb/>products &quot; in fourth place, after &quot; electrical and optical equipment &quot; , &quot; ICT &quot; and &quot; Computer services and <lb/>related activities &quot; , and just above &quot; motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers &quot; (Hollanders and Arundel <lb/>(2005), p.14). It is similarly the case in the majority of the 15 European countries surveyed. The proportion <lb/>of innovative firms is higher in chemicals than in manufacturing industry as a whole, both in terms of <lb/>product and process innovation, and of organisational and marketing innovation. And this is consistently <lb/>observed across different countries in this survey. 21 <lb/>21. <lb/>However, aggregated numbers for the &quot; chemicals sector &quot; mask the substantial diversity of its <lb/>sub-sectors. The difference is particularly visible in R&amp;D intensity for pharmaceuticals and the rest of the <lb/>chemicals sector (Figure 9(a)), and as a result pharmaceuticals are often presented separately from the rest <lb/>of the chemicals. 22 This gap has widened in many countries over the past 10 years, as the R&amp;D intensity in <lb/>pharmaceuticals went up while it dipped in the rest of the chemicals (Figure 9(b)). <lb/>22. <lb/>Neither should the diversity among the rest of the chemicals sector be overlooked. Available data <lb/>up to the 1990s show that R&amp;D intensity tends to be higher in speciality and consumer chemicals than in <lb/>basic industrial chemicals (Fleischer et al. (2000), p.85; Figure 10(a)). Moreover, R&amp;D intensities in <lb/>different sub-sectors have also been diverging over time. Deloitte (2009, p.9) reports that while the R&amp;D <lb/>intensity (R&amp;D/revenues) for speciality chemicals remained in the range of 3.0-3.5% during 1998-2008, it <lb/>has declined from over 2% to 0.5% for commodity chemicals during the same period. <lb/>23. <lb/>The purpose of R&amp;D spending is also very different in different sub-sectors. A study on <lb/>European chemical firms in 1990s shows that only 30% of basic chemicals firms spend more than 75% on <lb/>product innovation, while more than 60% of agrochemicals, paints and varnishes companies do so <lb/>21 <lb/>See also Aschhoff et al. (2008), p.11 (innovation survey results in Germany) and Mercer (2004) (in UK). <lb/>22 <lb/>See e.g. European Commission (2008), p.44. Given the different nature of pharmaceuticals, innovation in <lb/>pharmaceuticals is not the primary focus of this study. Hollanders and Arundel (2005) also acknowledges <lb/>that one factor behind the high ranking of &quot; chemicals and chemical products &quot; sector is presence of <lb/>pharmaceuticals (p.30). However, data availability at disaggregate level often limits the possibility of <lb/>separate analysis (see cf. Patel (2008), p.2). <lb/></body>

			<body>(Albach et al. (1996), p.44-47). On the other hand, a larger share of companies in basic chemicals spends <lb/>heavily on process innovation than those in other sub-sectors (Figure 10(b)). <lb/>24. <lb/>The contribution of new products to sales further illustrates such diversity. A survey of American <lb/>chemical companies shows that, whereas new products contribute to 10% of the sales of basic chemicals, <lb/>they contribute to 23% for speciality and fine chemicals (ACC, 2009). <lb/>25. <lb/>Table 4 illustrates such diversity of focus in innovation in different sub-sectors. 23 Among the four <lb/>major types of innovation, the emphasis has generally shifted over time from product innovation to process <lb/>innovation in this industry (Hutcheson et al. (1996), p.21), but this shift best applies to basic industrial <lb/>chemicals (Hutcheson et al. 1995). With limited scope for product innovation, their focus is on process <lb/>innovation and organisational innovation to improve productivity and cost advantage. In contrast, product <lb/>innovation is of primary importance in speciality and fine chemicals, where there is still scope for new <lb/>products and molecules that can be protected by patents and as trade secrets, and as a result price <lb/>competition is less intense compared with that facing trade in basic industrial chemicals. Process <lb/>innovation also plays an important role. In consumer chemicals, renowned for marketing innovation, <lb/>consumers&apos; preference drives product innovation. The remainder of this section will examine the <lb/>underlying industry characteristics of these differences. <lb/>Table 4. Different foci of innovation in sub-sectors of chemicals industry <lb/>Basic Industrial <lb/>Speciality and Fine <lb/>Consumer <lb/>Product Innovation <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>Process Innovation <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>Marketing Innovation <lb/>x <lb/>Organisational Innovation <lb/>x <lb/>iii) Underlying Innovation Strategies in Different Segments <lb/>26. <lb/>To better understand the different foci of innovation, it is useful to refer to the framework for <lb/>structural analysis of industries proposed by Porter (1980, 1985) before turning to sub-sectors. 24 According <lb/>to the framework, five basic competitive forces – entry, threat of substitution, bargaining power of buyers, <lb/>bargaining power of suppliers, and rivalry among current competitors – define the state of competition in <lb/>an industry (Porter (1980), p.3-4); in coping with these competitive forces, firms have two sources of <lb/>competitive advantage, cost leadership and differentiation (ibid, pp.34-40). <lb/>27. <lb/>In the case of basic industrial chemicals, major entry barriers are the initial capital requirements <lb/>and the costs associated with technology, supply of raw materials and location. The source of competitive <lb/>advantage is the cost of production because product differentiation is not likely to take place. For speciality <lb/>and fine chemicals, major entry barriers are product differentiation (e.g. product differences and customer <lb/>relations) and differentiation is the major source of competitive advantage. Consumer chemicals are closer <lb/>to speciality and fine chemicals than basic industrial chemicals, but product differentiation (e.g. brand <lb/>loyalty) is a particular entry barrier, and therefore differentiation is typically the key source of competitive <lb/>advantage. <lb/>23 <lb/>Burgess et al. (2002), Figure 2 gives broadly similar illustration. However, this table is only indicative and <lb/>does not suggest that individual firms may not undertake other types of innovation. <lb/>24 <lb/>The adaptation of Porter framework to the chemicals industry is drawn on Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.124; <lb/>Frohwein and Hansjürgens (2004), pp.26-27. Government can influence many aspects of industry structure <lb/>(Porter (1980), pp.28-29). <lb/></body>

			<body>28. <lb/>In another related but different framework, Treacy and Wiersema (1993) set out three value <lb/>disciplines, operational excellence, customer intimacy and product leadership, as paths for market <lb/>leadership. Operational excellence means to provide customers with reliable products or services at <lb/>competitive prices and delivered with minimal inconvenience; customer intimacy means segmenting and <lb/>targeting markets and tailoring offerings to match the demands of those niches, thereby establishing <lb/>customer loyalty; and product leadership means offering customers leading-edge products and services that <lb/>enhance the customer&apos;s use of the product, rendering the competitors&apos; product obsolete. Operational <lb/>excellence is closely linked to cost leadership (as in basic industrial chemicals), while customer intimacy <lb/>and product leadership can be seen as two possible means for product differentiation (as in speciality and <lb/>fine chemicals and consumer chemicals), which are also reflected in the different foci of innovation in <lb/>different sub-sectors. <lb/>29. <lb/>This is inevitably a broad generalisation subject to exceptions and evolution over time. In <lb/>particular, the question of where to find the source of competitive advantage, or the key value disciplines, <lb/>is further accentuated in the economic conditions after the financial crisis (Hodges, 2009). <lb/>2. Subsectors <lb/>i) Basic industrial chemicals <lb/>(a) Industry characteristics <lb/>30. <lb/>Basic industrial chemicals are essentially commoditised products with established specifications, <lb/>including organic chemicals (mainly derived from petrochemicals) and inorganic chemicals as well as <lb/>polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. They are produced and sold in large volumes and <lb/>occupy a major part of sales value in the chemicals industry. 25 Opportunities to introduce fundamentally <lb/>new products are limited, although variations of existing products can be introduced in response to market <lb/>needs, thus process technology tends to be more important than product innovation. Production plant <lb/>location is mainly driven by production cost and the supply of raw materials and markets. <lb/>31. <lb/>Manufacturing takes place at large dedicated and capital intensive plants using highly specialised <lb/>processes. Process choices need to be made based on the current and projected costs (e.g. future energy and <lb/>regulatory costs) at the time of plant design, since fundamental process changes ex post are very expensive <lb/>due to their high capital intensity and degree of specialisation, even if incremental investments are often <lb/>made in order to keep up with developments in process technology as well as to ensure compliance with <lb/>new regulatory requirements, to improve health and safety conditions at the plant, to eliminate impurities <lb/>and to re-balance product composition. <lb/>32. <lb/>High initial capital requirements are a major barrier to entry. On the other hand, the availability <lb/>of key process technologies through licensing has substantially reduced the entry barrier. Available data in <lb/>the 1980s (Figure 11(a)) show the prevalence of licensing in sectors with large scale production facilities <lb/>and relatively homogeneous products (e.g. petrochemicals). In particular, licensing from specialised <lb/>engineering firms ( &quot; SEFs &quot; ) has been particularly important for smaller chemical companies or <lb/> &quot; non &quot; -chemical companies, which do not have sufficient in-house technological capabilities (Figure 11(b)). <lb/>SEFs originated in the United States in 1950s and further spread to Germany and other developed <lb/>countries, 26 and they have played an essential role as technology suppliers in processes and plant design to <lb/>25 <lb/>Sales share of European chemical industry (2007) by sub-sectors: &quot; base chemicals &quot; (45%), &quot; specialty <lb/>chemicals &quot; (17%), &quot; consumer chemicals &quot; 11%) and &quot; pharmaceuticals &quot; (27%). (CEFIC (2009)) <lb/>26 <lb/>The world market share of SEFs licenses (in total number of plants) in 1980-90 was: US (15.1%), West <lb/>Germany (8.8%), UK (2.4%), Italy (1.6%), France and Japan (0.7% each).

			<body>Europe and Japan through to developing countries. Figure 13(b) also shows that not only SEFs but also <lb/>chemical companies have been active as technology suppliers. 27 The availability of technology from these <lb/>technology suppliers has been critical to the global emergence of chemical industry we see today. <lb/>Box 2. The Functions of Chemical Engineering Companies <lb/>The business of chemical engineering companies usually involve one or some of the following four categories: <lb/>(i) Licensing of Process Technologies: Process technologies optimised for specific products are developed and <lb/>licensed to users, especially in basic industrial chemicals. <lb/>(ii) Licensing of equipment designs: Equipment optimised for a particular chemical process are designed and <lb/>licensed to users, especially in basic industrial chemicals. The optimisation involves appropriate control of kinetics, <lb/>thermodynamics and mass transfer processes and designed by using computer modelling. <lb/>(iii) Supply of manufacturing equipment: This may involve equipment not dedicated to a particular chemical <lb/>process but can be used in different processes (especially in speciality and fine chemicals). <lb/>(iv) Supply of catalysts: Catalysts designed for a particular process are developed and supplied to users. <lb/>Catalysts are an essential part of many chemical processes and have a finite useful life. Suppliers provide <lb/>replacements and can improve them through R&amp;D. <lb/>(b) Technology transfer and entry of emerging economies <lb/>33. <lb/>The trade and innovation linkage in basic industrial chemicals has been making a serious impact <lb/>on the chemicals industry. The large scale transfer of technology from developed countries to emerging <lb/>economies through SEFs and chemical companies as well as through joint ventures and M&amp;As have <lb/>helped emerging country players to innovate and enter into the global market; this has in turn created <lb/>competitive pressure on developed country players to innovate further. <lb/>34. <lb/>Many emerging economies have been actively promoting the chemical industry to exploit their <lb/>cost advantage and proximity to raw materials (oil and coal) and to growing domestic and neighbouring <lb/>markets. 28 For example, the Indian government has taken steps to improve the competitiveness of the <lb/>chemical industry by abolishing industrial licensing to most of the chemical subsectors, approving FDIs up <lb/>to 100 percent, reducing the list of reserved chemicals for the small-scale sector, and setting up integrated <lb/>Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions (PCPIR) (Prahalathan (2007), p.50; KPMG <lb/>International (2009b), pp.3-4). In China, petrochemicals is one of the industries in Plans for Promoting the <lb/>10 Leading Industries, announced in January-February 2009, for which large projects are to be supported <lb/>in a prioritised manner, with a target to increase the industry&apos;s value added to 1.75 trillion Yuan by 2011 <lb/>(Kwan, 2009). Chemical parks of various scales have been developed, large ones encompassing entire <lb/>27 <lb/>At a first glance, active technology licensing by chemical companies looks puzzling, since this appears to <lb/>be a sure way to increase the number of competitors. One explanation is that it was prompted by licensing <lb/>by SEFs, since even if chemical producers do not license their technologies, SEFs will do so anyway (and <lb/>they are under no pressure of potential competition), and it is better for chemical producers to license their <lb/>technology and make some additional profit out of licensing. An alternative explanation is that such <lb/>licensing by chemical companies may also be a part of their strategies, such as to impose a technology <lb/>standard or to provide customers with secondary suppliers using the same technology (Cesaroni et al. <lb/>(2004), p.148-49). See also Arora (1997), pp. 397-99; Arora and Fosfuri (1998), pp.10-14. <lb/>28 <lb/>See cf. KPMG International (2010a), pp.8 and 10. <lb/></body>

			<body>value chains designed for global players and medium-sized ones developed for domestic investors (KPMG <lb/>International (2009c), p.13; Table 5 below). <lb/>35. <lb/>Large-scale investment plans in China and the Middle East announced around 2005 are now <lb/>being made operational. It is estimated that new capacity in 2010 in the basic commodities category will <lb/>comprise almost 8% of the existing global capacity, and nearly 80% of the new capacity in 2009-13 will be <lb/>installed in China and Middle East (Deloitte (2009), p.7). <lb/>36. <lb/>To enable emerging economy players to develop their production capacities, the availability of <lb/>technologies through licensing from SEFs and chemical companies has played a key role. Chemical plant <lb/>engineering companies offer a package comprising of core technology, engineering design and knowhow, <lb/>and contract construction services (Arora (1997), p.396), and are active in developing large and efficient <lb/>plants being built up in emerging economies (Gottwald, 2007). A study in India on basic chemical firms <lb/>(inorganic, organic, dyes and pigments, polymers and rubbers) found that acquisition of technological <lb/>capabilities (through investments on imported technology or in-house R&amp;D) is important in determining <lb/>export competitiveness. (Bhat and Narayanan, 2009) <lb/>37. <lb/>The entry of emerging market players has exerted strong competitive pressure on chemical <lb/>producers in developed countries (e.g. HLG (2009), p11). The chemicals sector in developed countries, <lb/>especially in basic and intermediate petrochemicals, has already undergone extensive and continuous <lb/>organisational changes and rationalisations during the last three decades as a measure to recover cost <lb/>advantage, driven primarily by competition from new entrants and diminishing economic opportunities <lb/>after the oil shocks in 1970s. Many companies have moved away from being diversified conglomerates to <lb/>focus on their core competencies and have sought to reduce over capacities and to achieve scale economies <lb/>and higher margins (Albach et al. (1996), pp. 35-47; Landau and Arora (1998), pp. 11-12; Chapman and <lb/>Edmond (2000), pp. 755-760) 29 . <lb/>38. <lb/>Alongside cost cutting measures such as implementation of lean manufacturing and extension of <lb/>outsourcing, supply chain management is critical for the industry. Its supply chain extends from raw <lb/>materials to finished products, and the supply chain management costs represent 8-10 percent of the <lb/>turnover of chemical companies (KPMG International, 2009d). Facing increased complexity of globalised <lb/>supply chains coupled with lower margins, several major chemical companies have launched innovative <lb/>initiatives to optimise their supply chains and cut cost. 30 Information and communication technology is <lb/>widely introduced to implement process innovation in order to better manage supply chains and <lb/>distribution networks, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction (PwC (2010a), pp.2-3, KPMG <lb/>International (2009d), pp. 11-12). Among the US chemical companies, electronic commerce is especially <lb/>prevalent in basic chemicals, where products are more standardised. Electronic commerce makes up for <lb/>23% of the sales in basic chemicals, whereas it is 10% in speciality chemicals (ACC, 2009). <lb/>39. <lb/>Sustainability concerns, alongside cost considerations, are other drivers of process innovation. <lb/>For example, the application of biotechnology to chemicals production (industrial biotechnology or &quot; white <lb/>biotechnology &quot; that uses biologically derived catalysts for chemicals production in place of conventional <lb/>ones and may also replace fossil resources with biomass as raw materials, is expected to make production <lb/>processes more environmentally friendly (HLG (2009), p.11; OECD (2001a)). 31 OECD (2010) estimates <lb/>29 <lb/>Deloitte (2009) shows that the commodity chemicals sector experienced sharper decline in gross margin in <lb/>1998-2008 compared with specialty and integrated chemicals companies.

Industrial <lb/>biotechnology is at an early stage of its technological lifecycle: close collaboration between industry and <lb/>academia has been playing an important role. 32 <lb/>(c) Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) <lb/>40. <lb/>Acquisition and divestiture of businesses are also often a part of large cost cutting and/or <lb/>repositioning strategies for chemical companies. 33 Some large chemical companies, such as ICI, have been <lb/>broken up and/or merged with other companies. <lb/>32 <lb/>OECD (2001a) pp.72 and 78 provides examples. <lb/>33 <lb/>Largest recent examples include acquisition of ICI by AkzoNobel (Box 3) and Rohm and Haas by Dow <lb/>Chemical in 2008. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3. Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) <lb/>ICI was founded in 1926 in Britain through a merger of smaller firms to become one of the dominant players in <lb/>the world market in the pre-WWII period, together with IG Farben in Germany (founded in 1925) and DuPont in the <lb/>United States. Operation of ICI for over 50 years focused on three linked large complexes in Teesside at Billingham, <lb/>Wilton and North Tees, with a further large facility at Runcorn and other smaller plants around the world. However, ICI <lb/>progressively withdrew from many of its businesses and employment in chemical industry in Teeside declined from 20 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">000 to 11 000 between 1981 and 1998. The Wilton site, the largest single-company complex built by ICI in North East <lb/>England, was transformed and now owned by SembCorp, a company providing engineering and facilities management <lb/>services, hosting chemical companies including Croda International, Dow, DuPont, Huntsman, and Invista. When ICI <lb/>was split to form Zeneca (merged with Astra of Sweden in 1999 to form Astra Zeneca) in 1993, ICI was expected to <lb/>focus on commodity chemicals, yet this was soon reversed to re-focus on speciality chemicals (including businesses <lb/>bought from Unilever) in order to cope with increasing competitive pressure, until it was finally acquired by AkzoNobel <lb/>in 2008. <lb/>Source: Landau and Arora (1998), p.9; Chapman and Edmond (2000), p.760, Burgess et al. (2002), p.204. <lb/>41. <lb/>While the recent downturn has hit the levels of M&amp;A activities, strategic investors have shown <lb/>relative resilience compared with financial investors. In the peak year of 2007, financial investors <lb/>accounted for 20% of the deal value, often involving private equity firms. In 2009, the deal value was a <lb/>quarter of the peak year, and the share of financial investors declined to 13% (Figure 12). 34 This <lb/>manifestation of tight credit constraints notwithstanding, it may well underestimate the level of activities <lb/>by financial investors, since they participate in the bidding process and influence prices, even without <lb/>resulting in acquisition, or they make the deals for minority shares instead of full acquisition. A large deal <lb/>in 2008 involved acquisition of preferential shares convertible to a 10.4% stake in Dow Chemical. <lb/>Moreover, some acquirers, strategic investors in themselves, are portfolio companies of private equity <lb/>firms (financial investors) (PwC, 2009a). On the other hand, as the credit limits make it difficult for the <lb/>chemical companies to find buyers of their depressed assets, restructuring is also being sought by other <lb/>means, such as joint ventures, asset swapping and use of sovereign wealth funds (KPMG International <lb/>(2009b), pp.7-10; Bjacek (2009); Baker (2009), p.31). <lb/>42. <lb/>Emerging economies are entering centre stage in global M&amp;A activities. The levels of M&amp;A <lb/>activities involving BRICs countries picked up around 2004, about the same time as their acquisition <lb/>abroad started (Schneider et al. 2009). In particular, India has been active in outward investment <lb/>activities 35 e.g. the acquisition by Tata Chemicals of Brunner Mond in 2006 and General Chemical <lb/>Industrial in 2008, and a more recent bid by Reliance Industries to acquire LyondellBasell Industries in <lb/>November 2009 (the latter had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2009). 36 Among the <lb/>major motivations for outward investments are thought to be to gain access to knowhow or new markets <lb/>(Schneider et al. (2009), p. 103). 37 The deals involving China have been mainly domestic, with the <lb/>34 <lb/>Chemical sector is defined as chemicals and allied products defined by Thomson-Reuters business <lb/>classification (commodity, agricultural, specialty and diversified chemicals). <lb/>35 <lb/>KPMG International (2010a) notes that chemicals accounted for 48% of overseas investment (in value) by <lb/>Indian firms in the last five years (p.11) <lb/>36 <lb/>This bid was rejected in March 2010. See e.g. Joe Leahy (2010), &quot; Reliance pushes for Lyondell catalyst &quot; <lb/>the Financial Times, 20 January 2010; &quot; Lyondell rejects Reliance&apos;s $14.5bn bid &quot; the Financial Times, 8 <lb/>March 2010. <lb/>37 <lb/>Tiwari and Herstatt (2009) found that, concerning direct investment from India to Germany, market-<lb/>seeking was the dominant investment motivation among IT firms, but technology seeking motivation was <lb/>more important among automotive sector.

			<body>majority of cross border deals being inbound (i.e. foreign firms acquire Chinese businesses; PwC (2009b), <lb/>p.8). Major Chinese companies have set up joint ventures with global players in China in wide range of <lb/>products (Table 5; Engman et al. 2006, p.125). In one count, a majority of 10 000 chemical units in China <lb/>are joint ventures (Prahalathan, 2007, p.32). However, outbound activities from China are expected to <lb/>expand in near future (PwC (2009b), p.3; Shuqing (2009)). <lb/>43. <lb/>This broad development is not over today but has been further intensified by the financial crisis. <lb/>KPMG International (2009a) predicts that a massive expansion in bulk chemicals in the Middle East to <lb/>2015 will make up to 20% of plants of the European petrochemical industry uncompetitive, and that while <lb/>European and US companies concentrate on portfolio rationalisation and divestiture of distressed assets, <lb/>cash rich Middle Eastern and Chinese players will move to acquire these assets to gain access to <lb/>technology and the market over the next one to two years. 38 <lb/>Table 5.

Development in chemical distribution industry <lb/>Chemical products have typically been distributed directly from the producers to customers, but this is changing. <lb/>A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that this direct supply accounts for 90% of the global <lb/>distribution, but that distribution through third parties has increased by 10% in 2006-08, higher than the growth rate of <lb/>chemicals consumption. Industrial chemicals occupy about 60% of the third-party distribution, whereas specialty <lb/>chemicals make up the remaining 40%. <lb/>If the chemical products are very diverse in nature, so are their customers. 20-40% of chemicals are believed to <lb/>be consumed by customers with annual consumption less than 100 000 euro, depending on the customer industry, <lb/>and this ratio is much higher in China and Brazil (over 75%). Those smaller customers are at the same time <lb/>contributors to profit margin for producers due to strong pressures on prices from larger customers.

			<body>distribution for these smaller customers is a particular challenge for the producers, and it has increasingly been <lb/>outsourced to third-party distributors, aiming to improve cost efficiency by rationalising sales efforts or, in case of <lb/>emerging markets, to overcome the insufficient sales volume for direct sales. <lb/>The business model of chemical distributors is to source from multiple producers to ensure a broad offering; to <lb/>take physical ownership of products, warehouse them and mix, blend and repackage them to meet the needs of <lb/>customers; and to sell and physically transport goods to customers. It is distinguished from the business models of <lb/>logistics-only companies and trading companies, which do not take ownership or offer key value added services such <lb/>as mixing and blending. These services offered by chemical distributors enable customers to benefit from single <lb/>sourcing, speed and flexibility of delivery. <lb/>The BCG study suggests that there is still room for producers to rationalise their distribution, not only because the <lb/>process of outsourcing is ongoing but also because many of the producers currently have a complex relationship with <lb/>multiple distributors due to lack of coordination across business units and regions. It also notes that more acquisitive <lb/>growth to form a global network will contribute to improve the value and competitiveness of a distribution business, and <lb/>will meet the expectations of producers and customers better. <lb/>During the past several years, M&amp;As in chemical distribution, especially in Europe, has been driven by private <lb/>equity investors, who were attracted by stable cash flows, limited financial risks and profitable exit prospects of this <lb/>business. They are active in acquisition of other chemical distributors to seek synergy and to increase market value. <lb/>The financial crisis also hit the distribution business and M&amp;A activities, but the initial public offering (IPO) of Brenntag <lb/>AG, the leading chemical distributor and owned by BC Partners Ltd, which raised 747.4 million euros in late March <lb/>2010 is expected to raise the prospect of further flotation and consolidation. As the drive for cost efficiency persists on <lb/>the side of producers, especially in basic industrial chemicals, relations between producers and distributors can <lb/>become more important than ever before. <lb/>40 <lb/>ii) Speciality and fine chemicals <lb/>(a) Industry characteristics <lb/>44. <lb/>Speciality and fine chemicals are, compared to basic industrial chemicals, higher value-added <lb/>products produced on a smaller scale in more flexible plants using simpler chemicals as inputs. Examples <lb/>include dyes, paints, sealants and adhesives as well as certain organic chemicals and petrochemicals (e.g. <lb/>engineering plastics). The products are highly specialised and diverse, designed to perform a particular <lb/>function to meet the needs of the market or customers, mainly in other industry segments. An essential <lb/>aspect of the business, therefore, is to sell solutions to customers&apos; problems (Swift (1999), p.35). Products <lb/>are also formulated as services (known as chemical management services) instead of goods; e.g. selling <lb/>water treatment services instead of selling chemical products for water treatment. 41 <lb/>45. <lb/>In response to increasing competitive pressure in basic industrial chemicals, many chemical <lb/>companies have been turning to speciality and fine chemicals for their sources of profit where product <lb/>differentiation rather than cost is the key source of competitive advantage (e.g. Burgess et al. (2002), <lb/>p.200). This is especially the case with developed countries, but companies in China, India and Middle <lb/>East are also seeking to move in this direction (KPMG International (2009b, 2009c), Baker (2009)). The <lb/>relative flexibility of these production plants makes it easier to introduce new process steps or manufacture <lb/>a wide range of products. <lb/>46. <lb/>The diversity of speciality and fine chemicals is reflected in the impact of the recession since the <lb/>last quarter of 2008. The chemicals used in automotives and construction were hardest hit (coatings, <lb/>40 <lb/>BCG (2010); Fermont (2007); HLG (2009); &quot; The chemistry of private equity &quot; , Chemistry World (February <lb/>2008); &quot; The time is ripe &quot; ICIS.com (23 November 2009); Martin Arnold &quot; Brenntag listing raises 748m for <lb/>BC Partners &quot; , FT.com (29 March 2010). <lb/>41 <lb/>See CIGT (2002), p.95 and Upstill (2006), p.21 for more illustrations and examples. <lb/></body>

			<body>adhesives, sealants), in contrast to those used for personal care, food and pharmaceuticals. But such <lb/>conventional product segments still do not complete the picture. For example, a number of companies are <lb/>finding their future in product innovation in environmentally friendly construction chemicals, which are, <lb/>again, coatings, adhesives, sealants, but designed to be energy efficient, durable and less wasteful, and are <lb/>actively investing in the development and commercialisation of those products. 42 <lb/>(b) The role of product innovation <lb/>47. <lb/>The crucial role of product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals can be seen in the higher <lb/>proportion of revenues generated from new products than in industrial chemicals (see supra Section <lb/>III.1.(i)). Product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals can serve various purposes. First, as these <lb/>products are typically designed to achieve certain outcomes (e.g. dyeing fabrics, weeding particular plants), <lb/>new products may be introduced to improve intended performance or to introduce more differentiated <lb/>quality specifications (grades). Second, new chemicals may be introduced to meet new demands created by <lb/>innovation in downstream markets. This is typically the case with new active pharmaceutical ingredients <lb/>supplied to the pharmaceutical industry, but new molecules may be introduced in other sectors to meet new <lb/>economic and social needs, such as the new demand for environmentally friendly products (e.g. fuel cells, <lb/>organic LED). Third, new chemicals may also be introduced due to their improved performance in the <lb/>process of production or use by reducing inputs or eliminating harmful constituents. Finally, new products <lb/>may serve as substitutes for regulated chemicals. This may happen in response to prohibition of some <lb/>chemicals (e.g. CFCs by the Montreal Protocol) or regulation of the way in which products are marketed <lb/>and consumed (e.g. the treatment of effluent or disposal of waste). Trade often serves as a conduit for the <lb/>fruits of innovation in the chemicals sector to improve performance and foster innovation in downstream <lb/>sectors. <lb/>Box 5. Contribution to GHG Emission Savings in Downstream Industries <lb/>Speciality and fine chemicals can serve as an enabler of innovation for their users, beyond the boundary of the <lb/>chemical industry. Contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one such example. <lb/>Speciality and fine chemicals are used for various emission saving technologies and products. A report by the <lb/>International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA (2009), p.11) identifies &quot; the biggest levers evaluated for <lb/>emissions savings enabled by the chemical industry &quot; including: insulation materials for the construction industry, <lb/>increased agricultural yields due to crop protection chemicals and fertilisers, new lighting technologies based on <lb/>compact fluorescent lamps, plastic packaging, marine anti-fouling coatings, synthetic textiles, automotive plastics, low <lb/>temperature detergents, increased engine efficiency, plastic piping. In aggregate, this ICCA report estimates that for <lb/>every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by the chemical industry in 2005, it enabled 2.1 to 2.6 tons in savings via the <lb/>products and technologies it provides to other industries or users. <lb/>42 <lb/>ICIS.com (2009), Deliver the goods (23 November 2009); ICIS.com (2010), Green Build up (15 January <lb/>2010). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 6. Product Innovation in Response to Regulation and Environmental Concerns <lb/>43 <lb/>AkzoNobel produces a range of chelating agents, which sequester metal ions in aqueous solutions, for <lb/>household and industrial cleaning products such as detergent and soap. One of these products, NTA (nitrilotriacetic <lb/>acid), has been coming under increased regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the United States due to its potential <lb/>carcinogenic impacts. Since global household product manufacturers who use this do not wish to have multiple <lb/>formulations in different markets, the product is likely to be phased out including from markets where it does not face <lb/>regulation. <lb/>An alternative product known as Dissolvine GL was developed in 2000. There was initially limited interest from <lb/>customers to test and approve this product because it was more expensive than NTA, but the prospect of regulation <lb/>boosted the interest in this product. There was also a potential environmental benefit that drove interest in it, as it can <lb/>be used as a replacement for some phosphate/phosphonate compounds, which are also under scrutiny in the United <lb/>States, Canada and France. Unlike NTA which is produced from fossil fuels, this alternative product is made using <lb/>natural carbon sources from monosodium glutamate derived from food grade molasses, which means that 60% of the <lb/>carbon atoms in the formulation are derived from sustainable sources and 40% from fossil fuels. <lb/>48. <lb/>Trade not only serves as a channel of the fruits of product innovation, but it can also work to <lb/>expand the sources of innovative ideas. A survey shows that customers and suppliers are among the most <lb/>important sources of innovative ideas (after &quot; within the firm &quot; ) (Eurostat, 2007), but in the chemicals sector <lb/>38% of firms who introduced a new product answered that their customers were very important as a source <lb/>of information for innovation (26% for overall sample). 44 This is particularly true with speciality and fine <lb/>chemicals, where close customer relationships and servicing are important part of the business (Swift <lb/>(1999), p.35). <lb/>(c) Commoditisation, shift in market gravity and push for further innovation <lb/>49. <lb/>Even in speciality and fine chemicals, products are often eventually commoditised, and it is <lb/>recognised that this product and technology lifecycle is being shortened thus putting pressure on profits <lb/>(Baker (2009), p.30; Jerrentrup (2009)), due in part to globalisation. Chinese companies are active in <lb/>partnership with multinationals to gain access to advanced technologies, alongside in-house R&amp;D (KPMG <lb/>International (2009c), p.8). They are also pursuing outbound M&amp;A in speciality and fine chemicals, the <lb/>main motivation of which is considered to be gaining know-how. 45 Indian firms are also active in overseas <lb/>investment in this segment. 46 A large supply of well qualified chemists and chemical engineers, including <lb/>in emerging economies, together with the increased numbers of flexible chemical manufacturing facilities <lb/>in the world means that there is increasing potential for successful products to be copied by competitors <lb/>(Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.127). <lb/>50. <lb/>For example, fine chemical firms who develop and manufacture timber treatment chemicals used <lb/>to anticipate that it would take six years for them to be commoditised following the entry of low cost <lb/>43 <lb/>Information taken from an interview with Alan Alex, Chelates EMEA, AkzoNobel Functional Chemicals, <lb/>by Paul Wright, external consultant for this study, and AkzoNobel (2009) &quot; Cleaning up &quot; , AkzoNobel <lb/>Magazine Issue 3 (November 2009). <lb/>44 <lb/>Patel (2008), p.66. This percentage is even higher in biotechnology, machinery, automotives and <lb/>ICT/electronics, which recorded over 40%. <lb/>45 <lb/>China National Bluestar Corporation took over the Silicone Division of Rhodia, a listed France based <lb/>speciality chemical company, in October 2006 at 504 million USD. (Schneider et al. 2009). <lb/>46 <lb/>For example, Kiri Dyes &amp; Chemicals acquired Dy Star (Germany) for 70 million USD in March 2010 <lb/>(KPMG International (2010), pp.7 and 11). <lb/></body>

			<body>producers abroad. This period of time would give the innovator an opportunity to recoup its research and <lb/>development costs. More recently, however, this period has shortened to eighteen months, and the returns <lb/>on product innovation have accordingly fallen for some firms to the point where they can no longer rely on <lb/>it as a source of competitive advantage. <lb/>51. <lb/>Increased competition makes the case for further innovation even stronger. There has been a wide <lb/>variation in the performance of speciality and fine chemicals companies during the past 10 years, and <lb/>innovation to keep up with the market has been a key feature of the top performers (Deloitte (2009), p.16). <lb/>An econometric analysis at country level (see Appendix 2) also lends some support to the concept that <lb/>innovative capacity (the number of patent applications) is correlated with export and import patterns. 47 <lb/>52. <lb/>However, competition also has an effect of reducing the financial capability to finance R&amp;D <lb/>expenditure, and the time needed for R&amp;D before commercial implementation is critical in the face of <lb/>shortened product lifecycle. This necessity for cost and time savings has driven &quot; open innovation &quot; to gain <lb/>currency (OECD (2008b), p.27): companies increasingly rely on outside innovation for new products and <lb/>processes. De Wit et al. (2007) found that open innovation is particularly frequently observed in <lb/>development of new technologies in new markets in various sectors albeit to varying degrees. 48 They also <lb/>found that partners for innovation are influenced by the nature of the project: cooperation with universities <lb/>and specialised institutes very often takes place in the development of new technologies, whereas the <lb/>development of new markets with existing technologies takes place in cooperation with other companies. <lb/>53. <lb/>For example, the development of organic semiconductor materials is being undertaken at an <lb/>international level on various fronts involving large and small companies, often university spin-outs. <lb/>Partners of cooperation can be within the industry or in other industries in order to seek synergy. 49 <lb/>Partnership with customers is another possibility, which can foster technological advantages while securing <lb/>business relations. An econometric analysis (see Appendix 2) shows that cross border co-invention 50 has a <lb/>positive impact on the bilateral trade flows. The causation inferred from the timing of patent application <lb/>and trade flows appears to be working differently across sub-sectors, but practically, if collaborative <lb/>activities leading up to patent application is taken into account, such collaborative activities may have <lb/>implications in fostering trade relations. <lb/>54. <lb/>As the centre of gravity of market shifts to emerging markets, investment in those growing <lb/>markets has become an important part of business strategy, particularly in the speciality and fine chemicals <lb/>segment (Baker, 2009; KPMG International, 2010b). Because of the specialised nature of this segment, <lb/>proximity to customers is often considered imperative (KPMG (2005), p.31; KMPG International (2009c), <lb/>47 <lb/>Exporters&apos; patent application is generally positively correlated with trade flows, and importers&apos; patent <lb/>application is generally negatively correlated with trade flows, although their statistical significance varies <lb/>depending on the sub-sector and the specification. <lb/>48 <lb/>This study compares between food, polymers and equipment manufacturing sectors in terms of R&amp;D <lb/>collaborations. In all sectors collaboration is the highest for &quot; new market, new technology &quot; , and it is the <lb/>highest in equipment manufacturing and the lowest in polymers. <lb/>49 <lb/>Süd-Chemie and Linde launched a pilot plant in May 2009 for the production of second generation <lb/>bioethanol from cereal straw. It is expected that Süd-Chemie´s expertise biocatalysis and bioprocess <lb/>engineering and Linde&apos;s experience in implementing chemical and biotechnological processes on a <lb/>commercial scale will generate synergy (Jerrentrup (2009), p.5; Süd-Chemie (2009)). <lb/>50 <lb/>It refers to the number of patents invented by a country with at least one inventor located in a foreign <lb/>country (OECD (2009a), pp.127-28). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 7. Management of Global R&amp;D Investment Decisions in Emerging Economies <lb/>52 <lb/>AkzoNobel has multiple applications laboratories located in proximity to the customers, such as Houston (for oil <lb/>field chemicals) and Australia, while retaining the central R&amp;D function in Europe. It is intended to encourage customer <lb/>oriented development of products and formulations and to ensure routes to the market, being assisted by their <lb/>distributor and agent networks that identify end use markets and arrange product trials and approvals. Information on <lb/>the development in those application laboratories are shared across the company through on-line internal forums and <lb/>regular meetings so that interaction of ideas take place and ultimately achieve a higher success rate and wider <lb/>adoption of successful ideas. <lb/>Geographic segmentation changes with developments in economic reality. China and India are now being <lb/>considered as separate regions. In order to make better investment decisions in these regions, the company employs <lb/>a multi-site concept, i.e. locating many products on a single site in a concerted fashion instead of letting individual <lb/>business units decide where to locate new investments. <lb/>(d) Process innovation as a differentiation strategy <lb/>55. <lb/>Whilst product innovation is of primary importance, process innovation is another important <lb/>aspect of innovation in speciality and fine chemicals. It is typically a part of the differentiation strategy <lb/>rather than for cost reduction purposes, for example by reducing lead-time, or enhancing agility, to better <lb/>serve customers (Burgess (2002); Guisinger and Ghorashi (2004); Jerrentrup (2009), p.5). Introduction of <lb/>new products is also often accompanied by the introduction of new processes. <lb/>56. <lb/>Process itself can be a core competence of a chemical company. For example, pharmaceutical <lb/>companies often invite competent chemical producers to supply samples of specific candidate <lb/>pharmaceutical chemicals. Suppliers need to undertake high quality synthesis according to the process <lb/>specified by the pharmaceutical company or by developing their own process, initially at a small scale but <lb/>eventually it may turn into a larger scale production. Some companies have developed core competence in <lb/>process technologies to meet such requirements. <lb/>iii) Consumer chemicals <lb/>(a) Industry characteristics <lb/>57. <lb/>Consumer chemicals are usually formulated products such as personal care products or household <lb/>products. These are differentiated from other segments in that they are marketed to consumers and <lb/>customer influence is much greater. Consumer chemicals are often grouped together with food, drinks and <lb/>tobacco as FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) or consumer packaged products, which is known as the <lb/>birth place of brand management and renowned for marketing innovation (Crawford et al. 2007). Product <lb/>innovation and underlying R&amp;D capability is also indispensable to respond to diverse and often fluid <lb/>consumer preference, and to maintain the power of the brand (Jones, 2005). Although consumer chemicals <lb/>have generally weathered the recession better than others, product innovation that reinforces brand loyalty, <lb/>such as in the field of natural personal care, will stimulate recovery, as the patterns of recovery from <lb/>previous recessions attests. 53 <lb/>52 <lb/>Information taken from an interview with Alan Alex, Chelates EMEA, AkzoNobel Functional Chemicals, <lb/>by Paul Wright, an external consultant for this study, and Baker (2009), p.31. <lb/>53 <lb/>Gillian Morris (2010), &quot; Recession respite &quot; , ICIC.com (14 April 2010). <lb/></body>

			<body>58. <lb/>In addition to consumer chemicals marketed directly to consumers, many chemical companies <lb/>produce chemical materials for a range of goods marketed to consumers, such as textiles and clothing <lb/>(chemical fibres and dyes), footwear and car seats (polyurethane). They are typically not visible to <lb/>consumers, but the materials are sometimes highlighted when the final goods are marketed. <lb/>(b) Diversity of consumer preference and emerging markets <lb/>59. <lb/>Although multinationals with well-known brands are active in this area, key success factors are <lb/>in-depth knowledge of local market and the ability to adjust the products and marketing methods to local <lb/>consumer preference and other market characteristics. They can be vastly different and at the same time <lb/>changeable. One example is the sense of hygiene: when the practice of washing bodies with water was out <lb/>of fashion in Europe, despite the wide-spread practice of bathing in ancient Roman times, perfumes came <lb/>to the fore among aristocracy, until the practice revived thanks to development of modern germ theory and <lb/>spread of new ideas brought by foreign trade (e.g. &quot; champu &quot; (shampoo) from India); the white soap bar <lb/>was launched by an American entrepreneur in 1879, which later benefited from new marketing channels of <lb/>radio and television ( &quot; soap opera &quot; ) starting in the 1930s. 54 <lb/>60. <lb/>More recently, social and environmental issues have become an important factor behind <lb/>consumer preferences, and consumer chemical companies are finding market opportunities here. For <lb/>example, life-cycle assessments of the energy consumption by Proctor &amp; Gamble for its products found <lb/>that 3% of electricity budgets in US households were on heating water for laundry (Nidumolu et al. (2009), <lb/>p.8), which led to the launch of cold water detergents in 2005. Unilever considers it important to establish <lb/> &quot; social missions &quot; for brands to grow (McKinsey &amp; Co., 2009a). In the cosmetics industry, to stimulate <lb/>sustainable production and consumption, the COSMOS-standard has been developed in Europe that <lb/>defines minimum requirements and common definitions for organic and/or natural cosmetics. Consumers&apos; <lb/>attention can go beyond the narrow definition of consumer chemicals, due to the ubiquitous nature of <lb/>chemical products, and extend to the chemical inputs used in ranges of products, such as polyurethane <lb/>derived from vegetable used in car seats, biodegradable cosmetic packages, or soy inks. Well-informed, <lb/>empowered consumers are a powerful ally in supporting and driving green growth (OECD (2010b), p.80). <lb/>61. <lb/>Adding to these, breaking into consumer markets in emerging economies is increasingly an <lb/>important challenge. 55 They are keener and leaner on prices, and their distribution and marketing channels <lb/>tend to be very different from those of developed country markets, yet the consumers in emerging markets <lb/>are increasingly vital sources of further growth, especially amid slower growth in developed countries. 56 <lb/>62. <lb/>For example, expanding the market into more remote areas in India was a challenge due to the <lb/>lack of a retail network, advertising coverage and adequate roads and transport for Unilever despite its 75 <lb/>year history in India supplying food, personal care and home care products through a portfolio of <lb/>international and local brands targeting consumers of different income levels. Hindustan Lever, Unilever&apos;s <lb/>business in India, started &quot; Project Shakti &quot; ( &quot; strength &quot; in Sanskrit) in 2000 by partnering with local <lb/>women&apos;s self-help groups. Members of the groups are given training by the company to be entrepreneurs, <lb/>and they borrow money from the groups to start businesses as distributors of Hindustan Lever products. By <lb/>the end of 2004, there were over 13 000 Shakti women entrepreneurs covering 50 000 villages, selling to <lb/>70 million consumers. (Unilever (a); Keys et al. 2009) Hindustan Lever is also developing a separate <lb/>54 <lb/>The Economist (2009), &quot; The joy of dirt &quot; (17 December 2009). <lb/>55 <lb/>See The Economist (2010), &quot; Easier said than done: Emerging-market consumers are hard to reach &quot; (15 <lb/>April 2010). <lb/>56 <lb/>See also Figure 4(b) (showing growth rates higher for export from HICs to LMICs than for HICs to HICs <lb/>in consumer chemicals (HS Chapters 33 and 34) in 2001-08). <lb/></body>

			<body>campaign to educate people to wash their hands with soap, called &quot; &apos;Swasthya Chetna &quot; (health awakening), <lb/>as a marketing programme for its soap brand. By the end of 2007, the campaign had reached nearly 44 000 <lb/>villages and around 100 million people. (Unilever (b)) <lb/>63. <lb/>Not only marketing innovation, but also product innovation is taking place to develop products <lb/>that meets the specific needs of emerging markets. Proctor &amp; Gamble started its business in China in 1988 <lb/>through a joint venture targeting consumers in wealthy coastal cities with its premium products. By 2001, <lb/>this strategy reached its limits and it needed to expand to the &quot; mid-tier consumers &quot; to sustain growth and <lb/>profitability, in direct competition with local companies with lower costs and better knowledge about the <lb/>local consumers. In order to achieve the price levels affordable for these new consumers, which is vastly <lb/>different from those of globally marketed products, P&amp;G now designs products in China, controlling the <lb/>costs to meet the required price levels. (Hexter and Woetzel, 2007, pp.6-7) <lb/>64. <lb/>There is an early sign that product innovation and marketing efforts are contributing to the <lb/>recovery of consumer products companies. Proctor &amp; Gamble and Unilever both announced 7% increases <lb/>in sales, and the introduction of new products and additional spending on marketing are considered to have <lb/>boosted the sales, and strong sales growth in emerging markets has contributed to this overall <lb/>performance. 57 <lb/>65. <lb/>In some cases, products developed for emerging markets are being re-introduced to developed <lb/>country markets – labelled &quot; trickle-up &quot; innovation or &quot; reverse innovation &quot; to highlight the contrast to a <lb/>traditional model where a product is developed in developed countries and eventually marketed in <lb/>developing countries. The reported case that comes close to consumer chemicals is an over-the-counter <lb/>medicine by Proctor &amp; Gamble, initially developed for the Latin American market and eventually <lb/>rebranded and marketed in the United States and European markets 58 , but otherwise reported cases are still <lb/>limited. 59 Yet it has been argued that it is more a necessity than an option to compete effectively with <lb/>emerging market competitors. Given the increasing economic weight of emerging economies and the <lb/>increasing price-consciousness of consumers in developed countries, as well as tighter R&amp;D budgets of <lb/>MNEs, this can become one of the models of product innovation in consumer chemicals. <lb/>IV. <lb/>Trade-related measures <lb/>1. Tariffs <lb/>66. <lb/>Even though the levels of tariffs have declined over the past ten years, there still remain non-<lb/>negligible levels of tariffs, especially in non-CTHA participants, that incur direct costs to traders and <lb/>consequently consumers. Econometric analysis based on the gravity model (Appendix 2) shows that tariffs <lb/>still have a negative impact on trade in chemicals. <lb/>67. <lb/>In order to see how actual tariff levels are related to innovation considerations, we could test the <lb/>following two possibilities. First, if countries value technology diffusion through imports (cf. Coe et al. <lb/>2008), they may tend to set up relatively lower trade barriers for sectors with relatively less technological <lb/>57 <lb/>Hannah Kuchler (2010), &quot; &apos;Innovation&apos; paying off at Unilever &quot; , FT.com, 29 April 2010; Jonathan Birchal, <lb/> &quot; P&amp;G sales surge on new products &quot; , and &quot; Emerging markets fuel consumer goods groups &quot; , FT.com, 29 <lb/>April 2010. <lb/>58 <lb/>Jana, Reena (2009a), &quot; Innovation Trickles in a New Direction &quot; , BusinessWeek 11 March 2009; Jana, <lb/>Reena (2009b), &quot; P&amp;G&apos;s Trickle-up Success: Sweet as Honey &quot; , BusinessWeek 31 March 2009. <lb/>59 <lb/>See Immelt et al.

			<body>capability than other domestic sectors. On the other hand, if countries emphasise infant industry protection, <lb/>they may tend to set up relatively higher trade barriers for less competitive industries (cf. Krugman, 1987). <lb/>68. <lb/>A simple investigation of correlation between relative tariff levels, relative export value (i.e. <lb/>revealed comparative advantage) and relative R&amp;D spending shows that there is no statistical evidence to <lb/>support either of those hypotheses (see Appendix 3 for details). This may imply, as far as the chemical <lb/>industry is concerned, that innovation considerations are not systematic determinants for tariff policy in <lb/>most of the countries. Another possibility is that innovation considerations are actually systematic <lb/>determinants for tariff policy but are working in different directions (either technology diffusion enhancing <lb/>or infant industry protecting) across countries, which also prevent a systematic statistical relationship from <lb/>emerging as a whole. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from the exercise here. <lb/>2. Export Restrictive Measures <lb/>69. <lb/>While access to raw materials under fair and undistorted conditions is essential for a range of <lb/>industries including chemicals, tight supply and demand conditions as well as various forms of government <lb/>intervention aiming at restricting exports have been making it more challenging than before (European <lb/>Commission (2008c), pp.4-5). <lb/>70. <lb/>Disciplines on export restrictions are provided generally in GATT Article XI paragraph 1; &quot; No <lb/>prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, <lb/>import or export licences or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on <lb/>the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale <lb/>for export of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party. &quot; 60 This is, however, <lb/>subject to an exception in the GATT Artile XI paragraph 2 and general exceptions under GATT Article <lb/>XX, notably its chapeau and (g) ( &quot; relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such <lb/>measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption &quot; ). <lb/>71. <lb/>Whereas import duties are placed under the disciplines contained in the Schedules of Concession <lb/>(GATT Article II), there is nothing that generally restricts export duties 61 in the current GATT provisions. 62 <lb/>It is worth noting, however, commitment by individual Members to limit export duties on specific tariff <lb/>lines can be found either as a part of accession commitment, 63 or as a part of the Schedules of Concession, <lb/>with respect to specific tariff lines, although the actual cases are very limited. MFN principle applies also <lb/>to export duties (GATT Article I.1). <lb/>60 <lb/>GATT Article VIII.3(a), 5 (Fees and Formalities connected with Importation and Exportation) and X.1 <lb/>(Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations) lay out procedural principles that apply to exports <lb/>as well as imports. In addition, export taxes and export restrictions are listed as one of the &quot; Indicative List <lb/>of Notifiable Measures &quot; in the &quot; Decision on Notification Procedures &quot; adopted at the end of the Uruguay <lb/>Round negotiations, although it is accompanied by a note that states &quot; [t]his list does not alter existing <lb/>notification requirements &quot; in the agreement. &quot; Decision on Notification Procedure on Quantitative <lb/>Restrictions &quot; was adopted in 1996 (but not on export duties), and the notifications are regularly monitored, <lb/>although the actual notifications made have been less than complete. See G/L/223/Rev.17 (15 March 2010) <lb/>for the latest update. <lb/>61 <lb/>Export duties and export taxes have been used interchangeably. See Kazeki (2005), pp. 178-79. <lb/>62 <lb/>In some instances, export restrictions and prohibitions were replaced by export duties following the legal <lb/>disputes at the WTO. See Kazeki (2005), p.212. <lb/>63 <lb/>Examples are listed in Kazeki (2005), Table 5.4. <lb/></body>

			<body>72. <lb/>While the export restrictive measures have thus been subject to a lesser extent of discipline <lb/>compared with import measures under the GATT/WTO system, 64 it has in the past addressed this issue in <lb/>the context of supply of raw materials, in particular oil, in the 1970s 65 and of voluntary export restraints in <lb/>the 1980s 66 , and now it is drawing renewed attention in the context of supply of raw materials. The <lb/>chemical industry has also voiced their concerns over recent moves by some governments to take export <lb/>restrictive measures, such as export taxes on yellow phosphorus and export licenses or quotas on fluorspar <lb/>and coke by China, thereby restricting supplies to other countries to, various raw materials (HLG (2009), <lb/>p.33). When the raw material production is concentrated in a few countries (Table 6), export restrictive <lb/>measures taken by a producing country can have a large impact on the global supply, and hence on the <lb/>industries using the raw materials in question. <lb/>73. <lb/>In the WTO, proposals to enhance transparency in export licensing and to establish of rules on <lb/>transparency and predictability on export duties are pending in the Doha negotiations. 67 Export related <lb/>measures on raw materials are also pending before the dispute settlement panel, which covers, in part, <lb/>essential inputs to some segments of the chemicals industry and inorganic chemicals used in other <lb/>industries. 68 <lb/>74. <lb/>While the stated policy objectives of export restrictive measures include environmental <lb/>protection, promotion of domestic downstream industries, fiscal revenues and preservation of reserves, the <lb/>actual economic impact of export restrictive measures and their effectiveness in achieving these objectives <lb/>depends on various factors, such as supply and demand conditions, availability of alternative sources as <lb/>well as the nature of the raw material in question and of the measure itself (Korinek and Kim (2009), <lb/>pp.12-22). The trade policy review report on China prepared by the WTO Secretariat observed &quot; [a]lthough <lb/>the authorities believe that export taxes could help conserve natural resources or protect the environment, <lb/>their economic effectiveness in achieving those objectives is questionable. &quot; (WTO (2010a), para. 78) At <lb/>the OECD workshop on raw materials held in October 2009, it was found that &quot; export restrictions create <lb/>economic inefficiency by distorting resource allocation and can negatively affect the welfare of trade <lb/>partners &quot; and &quot; [w]hile export restrictions are applied to achieve several policy objectives, there exist <lb/>alternative policy options with different trade impacts &quot; (Kim, 2009). 69 Further studies are envisaged on this <lb/>topic. <lb/>64 <lb/>Despite this asymmetry between exports and imports, economic theory postulates that export tax in one <lb/>sector amounts to import tax on the other (Lerner&apos;s symmetry theorem), which further implies that import <lb/>tax in one sector amounts to export tax on the other. See Vousden (1990), pp.46-47. <lb/>65 <lb/>The issue of export restrictions was negotiated in the Tokyo Round, but it only resulted in an understanding <lb/>that the GATT export provisions should be reassessed in the near future.

Health, safety and environmental regulation <lb/>i) Regulation and multilateral trade rules <lb/>75. <lb/>The chemical sector is highly regulated for safety, health and environmental reasons and there <lb/>has been significant evolution in the regulatory regime during the past few decades. When governments <lb/>started to take regulatory actions on chemicals, they focused on specific industrial chemicals or pesticides <lb/>which were known to pose important health or environmental problems, but by mid-1970s, comprehensive, <lb/>forward-looking strategies were called for to identify and manage the potential risks of the hundreds of <lb/>new chemicals and chemical products entering the global market every year. Somewhat later, the much <lb/>greater number of chemicals and pesticides that were already on the market and whose potential risks had <lb/>not been identified arose as a policy issue (OECD (2001b), p.76). The OECD has been active since 1971 in <lb/>developing and co-ordinating chemical and pesticide related activities under its Chemicals Programme <lb/>(OECD (2008c), p.383). There are a number of other international arrangements to control chemicals for <lb/>various purposes. 70 <lb/>76. <lb/>The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 called for chemicals to be <lb/>produced and used in ways that minimise significant adverse impacts on human health and the <lb/>environment ( &quot; 2020 goal &quot; ). Since then, many countries have taken steps to improve their chemicals <lb/>regulation. Also, the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) was adopted as <lb/>a policy framework to foster the sound management of chemicals in 2006. <lb/>77. <lb/>Under the rules of the WTO, Members are generally able to take measures necessary to protect <lb/>human, animal or plant life or health, &quot; [s]ubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a <lb/>manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries <lb/>where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade &quot; (GATT Article XX, <lb/>chapeau and (b)). More specifically, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade ( &quot; TBT Agreement &quot; ) <lb/>70 <lb/>E.g. the Basel Convention (hazardous waste), the Montreal Protocol (CFCs) and the Rotterdam Convention <lb/>(hazardous chemicals), Stockholm Convention (persistent organic pollutants), United Nations Convention <lb/>Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (drug control) and the Chemical <lb/>Weapons Convention (arms control). <lb/></body>

			<body>stipulates a set of rules to ensure that technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary <lb/>obstacles to international trade, while recognising the policy objectives of the protection of human, animal <lb/>or plant life or health, of the environment (TBT Agreement, preamble). It lays out, among others, a <lb/>notification procedure for technical regulations when a relevant international standard does not exist and if <lb/>the technical regulation may have a significant effect on the trade (TBT Agreement, Article 2.9; Article 5.6 <lb/>for conformity assessment procedures). <lb/>78. <lb/>According to the TBT Information Management System, database maintained by the WTO <lb/>Secretariat, there have been over 1600 notifications under Article 2.9 and 140 notifications under Article <lb/>5.6 for chemicals (HS Chapters 28-39) since the WTO came into being in 1995. 71 Almost half of them <lb/>refer to human health, followed by environmental protection and labelling. The pattern is substantially <lb/>different across different product groups; &quot; human health &quot; predominant in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics <lb/>(Chapters 30 and 33), while both &quot; human health &quot; and &quot; environmental protection &quot; often appear <lb/>miscellaneous chemicals (Chapter 38; often pesticides) as well as for organic and inorganic, fertilisers and <lb/>paints (Chapters 28, 29, 31, 32). In contrast, &quot; labelling &quot; , &quot; safety &quot; , &quot; packaging &quot; and &quot; consumer protection &quot; <lb/>are more frequent for consumer chemicals. <lb/>71 <lb/>See also the note for Table 4 for details. Similar study is done by Menezes and Antunes (2005). See WTO <lb/>(2005a), pp.58-62, for various measurements of standardisation activities. <lb/></body>

In addition to these, the trade related measures on chemicals in <lb/>China (Regulations for Environmental Management on the First Import of Chemicals and the Import and <lb/>Export of Toxic Chemicals) and its ongoing revision have been regularly raised in the context of Annual <lb/>Transitional Review (TRM) of China&apos;s accession commitment. 73 TBT-related issues involving the <lb/>chemicals have also being discussed in the DDA/NAMA negotiations, and two text proposals have been <lb/>put on the table. 74 <lb/>72 <lb/>See e.g. WTO, Chemicals and toys main focus of members&apos; trade concerns, 20 March 2008 &lt; <lb/>http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news08_e/tbt_20march08_e.htm&gt;; WTO (2009a), paras. 73-75. <lb/>73 <lb/>See e.g. WTO, Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade, Minutes of the Meeting of 5-6 November 2008 <lb/>(G/TBT/M/46), 23 January 2009; Minutes of the Meeting of 5-6 November 2009 (G/TBT/M/49), 22 <lb/>December 2009. <lb/>74 <lb/> &quot; Understanding to facilitate the implementation nof the TBT Agreement as applied to trade in the chemical <lb/>products sector &quot; , submitted by Argentina and Brazil (TN/MA/W/135), 4 February 2010; &quot; Understanding <lb/>on Non-Tariff Bariers Pertaining to Standards, Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment <lb/>Procedures for Chemical Products &quot; , submitted by the European Union (TN/MA/W/137), 19 March 2010. <lb/></body>

			<body>ii) Chemicals regulation and impact on innovation <lb/>80. <lb/>The rules of the WTO are an instrument to balance the objectives of protecting health, safety and <lb/>environment and trade liberalisation. 76 On the other hand, whether and to what extent environmental <lb/>regulations and innovation interact with each other has been extensively debated and analysed. While <lb/>empirical analysis on the chemical regulation has not been abundant (Mahdi (2002), p.9-16), the recent <lb/>regulatory developments in the chemicals sector have drawn much attention. <lb/>75 <lb/>Excerpt from WTO (2010b), pp.25-35. <lb/>76 <lb/>Another instrument are the OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance (OECD <lb/>2005b), as concerns to market openness. The impact of standards on trade flows depends on their specific <lb/>types. WTO (2005b), pp.57-74 provides an overview. <lb/></body>

			<body>81. <lb/>The chemicals regulations in OECD countries have typically been designed as follows: <lb/>Governments collected data from chemical manufacturers to establish inventories of chemicals currently <lb/>being produced, thereby establishing the distinction between &quot; existing &quot; (on the inventory) and &quot; new &quot; (not <lb/>on the inventory) chemicals. Pre-market notification and registration/approval systems for industrial <lb/>chemicals and pesticides are in place in most OECD countries, and submission of information is required <lb/>for the authorities to assess the risks posed by the substance. This data requirement varies across countries. <lb/>On the other hand, prior to the introduction of pre-market regulation, chemicals were allowed to be put on <lb/>the market with very little or no information concerning their potential risks to human health and the <lb/>environment (OECD (2001b), pp.76-78). Major policy questions have been raised regarding this regulatory <lb/>scheme, such as the adequacy of risk assessment of new chemicals (data requirement from the businesses <lb/>and allocation of responsibilities between the authorities and businesses) and how to ensure the safety of <lb/>the existing chemicals (see e.g. European Commission (2001), p.6; USGAO (2007); USGAO (2009), <lb/>pp.22-24). <lb/>82. <lb/>In recent years, various initiatives have been introduced in many jurisdictions regarding <lb/>chemicals regulations. Among them, the EU&apos;s REACH regulation, entered into force on 1 June 2007, has <lb/>been widely expected to bring about a sea change in chemicals regulation in Europe and will also have <lb/>global impact. It covers all substances, new and old, unless explicitly exempted, and introduces a <lb/>registration scheme that requires manufacturers and importers to obtain relevant information (technical <lb/>dossier or chemical safety report, depending on the quantity) on their substance as well as an authorisation <lb/>system for substances of very high concern. Downstream users are also brought into the system and share <lb/>certain responsibilities (European Commission (2007), pp.5-7). REACH has been a major issue of <lb/>discussion at the WTO&apos;s TBT Committee. 77 Many non-EU WTO Members raised questions around, <lb/>among others, the data generation requirements under REACH in relation to the obligations of non-<lb/>discrimination and of not creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade according to terms of the <lb/>TBT Agreement. <lb/>83. <lb/>Aside from the debate at the WTO, the REACH legislation has proven an important development <lb/>for regulators in exploring the possible regulatory initiatives on the chemical substances. 78 There have been <lb/>a number of regulatory initiatives in recent years, and following is some of such examples. <lb/>84. <lb/>China has been preparing the amendment to its chemical control scheme under Measures on <lb/>Environmental Management of New Chemical Substances, introduced in 2003. 79 The first draft released in <lb/>May 2009 was updated in January 2010, and it is scheduled to be implemented starting October 2010. The <lb/>amendment maintains the basic structure of the current law, which applies to &quot; new &quot; substances, and <lb/> &quot; registration certificate &quot; of the new substance is required before manufacture or import of the substance. <lb/>The revision, on the other hand, is to increase the data requirement and risk management obligations by the <lb/>industry (Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, 2009). Certain ecotoxicological testing needs to be completed at <lb/>an accredited Chinese testing laboratory by using species within domestic China, and unlike the current <lb/>law, only a Chinese-registered entity can perform a submission and will be considered the registrant of the <lb/>substance (Bergeson &amp; Campbell, P.C. 2010). <lb/>77 <lb/>Motaal (2009), pp.649-657. It was notified to the TBT Committee in 2004 (G/TBT/N/EEC/52 (21 January <lb/>2004)). <lb/>78 <lb/>See USGAO (2007, 2009); Naiki (2010) (for impact on Japanese regulation); Park (2009) (for impact on <lb/>regulation in China, Japan and Korea); and Heyvaert (2009) (on dynamics of globalisation of regulation). <lb/>79 <lb/>It should be noted, however, that this &quot; Measures &quot; is not the only chemical regulation in China. See Park <lb/>(2009), Table 1 and Figure 2 for an overview of the structure of Chinese chemical control system. <lb/></body>

			<body>85. <lb/>Japan enacted an amendment to the Chemical Substances Control Law (Kashinho) in 2009 and <lb/>the first phase of implementation started in April 2010 (its full implementation is scheduled in April 2011). <lb/>It introduced an annual notification of production and import quantity of all chemical substances above <lb/>threshold, and hazard information may be requested for substances of higher priority of risk assessment. 80 <lb/>In parallel, collection of safety information on the prioritised existing chemicals is ongoing under the <lb/> &quot; Japan Challenge &quot; programme since 2005. <lb/>86. <lb/>Canada launched the Chemicals Management Plan in December 2006, under which harmful <lb/>chemicals were regulated immediately, and collection of information ( &quot; challenge &quot; ) on the properties and <lb/>uses is ongoing for the approximately 200 substances of highest priority. The information will be used to <lb/>decide the best approach to protect health and the environment (Government of Canada, 2009). <lb/>87. <lb/>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Essential Principles for Reform of <lb/>Chemicals Management Legislation in September 2009, setting out Administration goals to strengthen the <lb/>chemicals regulation, which includes a requirement for manufacturers to provide sufficient hazard, <lb/>exposure and use data on new and existing chemicals to determine their safety, and authority of EPA to set <lb/>priorities for conducting safety reviews on existing chemicals. In parallel, it announced the Chemical <lb/>Management Program which includes risk management on specific chemicals, collection of information to <lb/>prioritise chemicals for review and give public access to information. <lb/>88. <lb/>The consequence of the regulation was extensively discussed in the preparatory process of <lb/>REACH since the concept was unveiled in 2001 (European Commission (2001)). KPMG (2005), <lb/>commissioned by the European Commission and European industry groups, found that (a) critical <lb/>substances are not likely to disappear because of REACH testing and registration costs, because suppliers <lb/>are well aware of the impact of withdrawal of substances to the downstream users; (b) as product cost will <lb/>increase because of registration requirement, especially for substances manufactured or imported in lower <lb/>volumes, rationalisation of product portfolios may take place primarily on substances of less critical <lb/>importance to customers and of less strategic importance within the portfolios; even a small percentage of <lb/>withdrawal can give rise to much larger need for reformulation downstream; (c) companies studied do not <lb/>plan to increase their R&amp;D budget, and they will give priority to keeping existing substances and <lb/>formulations on the market to avoid problems down the supply chain, so the scale of divergence of R&amp;D <lb/>budgets depends on the scope of rationalisation; there can also be some delay in the time-to-market as the <lb/>R&amp;D department will get involved in registration activities; and (d) the stress factors accumulate at SMEs. <lb/>89. <lb/>The recent regulatory initiatives reviewed above generally point to (a) enhancement of data <lb/>collection of chemical substances, although with considerable differences in scope and data requirements, <lb/>and (b) extension of regulatory coverage to the existing chemicals. Their impact can be thought of in terms <lb/>of both the &quot; rate &quot; of innovation and the &quot; direction &quot; of innovation (cf. Mahdi (2002), p.9). First, if new <lb/>regulations involve additional cost and time burdens, they may have a negative effect on innovative <lb/>activities (rate of innovation). Second, new regulations may give incentives toward safer and more <lb/>environmentally friendly chemicals (direction of innovation). <lb/>90. <lb/>First, the impact of additional cost and time on innovation is likely to be different for different <lb/>sub-sectors. For industrial chemicals, as most of their products are in the &quot; existing &quot; category, if new <lb/>chemical regulation is to require submission of data on all chemicals, this will mean additional cost which <lb/>was not foreseen before, and because of the standardised nature of the products competing on prices, <lb/>transferring additional cost onto prices could be difficult. On the other hand, because of their large scale <lb/>80 <lb/>METI et al, (2009); See Naiki (2010) for a comparative analysis of Japanese chemicals regulation and <lb/>REACH. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>38 <lb/></page>

			<body>production, the additional cost can be mitigated by the economies of scale (Frohwein and Hansjürgens <lb/>(2004), pp.30-31). <lb/>91. <lb/>In contrast, for speciality and fine chemicals, characterised by continuous product innovation, <lb/>product differentiation and small scale production, if a new regulation incurs additional time and greater <lb/>cost to registration and authorisation of new chemicals than before, this may delay or discourage the <lb/>introduction of new chemicals. If the new regulation extends to existing chemicals, additional regulatory <lb/>burden may result in rationalisation of portfolio of chemicals in the market, especially for low-volume or <lb/>low-margin products. As a quick and flexible response to specific and low-volume customer needs is based <lb/>on the availability of a large pool of differentiated chemical substances, if new regulation diminishes the <lb/>existing and future chemical portfolio, it can adversely affect the competitiveness in this segment and can <lb/>impair the prospect of further innovation. And this, unlike the one-off cost of registration, can leave a <lb/>lasting effect. (Frohwein and Hansjürgens (2004), pp.31-32; Feldmeier and Kienert (2008)) The practical <lb/>effect on innovation depends on the actual time and cost burden and to what extent such rationalisation <lb/>takes place. 81 <lb/>92. <lb/>Second, regulatory tightening can encourage the innovative efforts toward safer products. 82 Such <lb/>regulatory measures are not limited to outright restrictions of hazardous chemicals but can include various <lb/>other types of measures. Koch and Ashford (2005, pp.43-44) reports the effects of the Massachusetts <lb/>Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) passed in 1989, which introduced a requirement for firms to prepare a <lb/>Toxics Use Reduction Plan to show how toxic chemicals are used and how they could be reduced. Out of 1 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">000 facilities that took part in the reporting, 400 have quit using the reported chemicals, and the estimated <lb/>cost savings by the firms by implementing safer alternative production process exceeded the estimated <lb/>regulatory cost between 1990-97. 83 Access to information is another type of measure. Since the <lb/>information collected by the regulatory authority contains useful information for the downstream <lb/>businesses and consumers, such information is often made publicly accessible within the limits of <lb/>protection of confidential business information. For example, exposure profiles of individual substances <lb/>and their toxicity and inflammability gives the opportunity for the users of the substances to avoid the risks, <lb/>by not using the substance or properly devising the risk management of the substance. This can, in turn, <lb/>provide incentives for the manufacturers to search for safer alternatives (Koch and Ashford (2005), p.41). 84 <lb/>93. <lb/>Chemicals regulation should be designed to be non-market distorting to be efficient, innovation-<lb/>friendly and promote long-term solutions. 85 As pointed out in the Interim Report on the Green Growth <lb/>Strategy by the OECD, the creation of unintended distortions or unnecessary administrative burdens <lb/>impedes dynamic economic efficiency, and the competitive business environment supports the <lb/>achievement of environmental goals in a cost effective way (OECD (2010b), pp.77-78). Practically, the <lb/>impact of the recent development in the chemicals regulation needs some more time to observe, since they <lb/>are still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In the case of REACH, for example, <lb/>81 <lb/>European Commission (2007, p.16) expects substances withdrawn because their continued production <lb/>would not be profitable to be 1-2%. It also notes that as a result of the KPMG (2005) study cited above, <lb/>registration costs for lower tonnage substances have been substantially reduced, largely through reducing <lb/>the number of substances requiring any toxicology testing (ibid.). <lb/>82 <lb/>Substitution of hazardous chemicals is stated as one of the key elements for REACH (European <lb/>Commission (2001), p.8; European Commission (2009a), p.5). <lb/>83 <lb/>In the case of REACH, authorisation is required for substances of very high concern, and application for <lb/>authorisation need to include an analysis of possible substitutes, and if suitable alternatives are available <lb/>then the application must also include a substitution plan. (European Commission (2007), p.13) <lb/>84 <lb/>See also discussions on speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals, supra Section III.2. <lb/>85 <lb/>See cf. discussions on export restrictive measures (IV.2) and climate change, infra. <lb/></note>

			<body>registration of 30 000 substances is scheduled to take place in three stages over the first 11 years after entry <lb/>into force (European Commission, 2007). It is therefore necessary to keep track of those developments in <lb/>order to properly assess their full impact. 86 <lb/>Box 8. A short review of the literature on the impact of environmental regulation on innovation <lb/>Regulation has typically been seen as a source of concern in terms of competitiveness of industries, since it <lb/>imposes extra cost and time burden and diverts resources away from innovation. However, Porter and van der Linde <lb/>(1995, p.98) presented an entirely opposite view, arguing that &quot; properly designed environmental standards can trigger <lb/>innovation that may partially or more than fully offset the costs of complying with them &quot; because &quot; reducing pollution is <lb/>often coincident with improving the productivity with which resources are used &quot; drawing on examples to support this <lb/> &quot; Porter hypothesis &quot; . <lb/>87 <lb/>The impact of environmental regulation on innovation has also been a subject of economic analyses <lb/>(Jaffe et al. 2000, pp. 31, 65). There have been a substantial number of studies that suggests that more stringent <lb/>environmental regulation or higher electricity prices induce innovative activities and enhance energy efficiency <lb/>(Popp et al. 2009, pp.7-23); if not completely &quot; offset &quot; the compliance cost that Porter hypothesis alluded to. The impact <lb/>of regulation can even go beyond the national border. One such example is car emissions regulations in the United <lb/>States in 1970s, which prompted innovation by Japanese and German automotive industries (ibid. p.36). It is important <lb/>to note that an empirical study on this question should be read in its specific context; all environmental regulations are <lb/>not created equal, and their impact on industries <lb/>88 and their responses are not the same. <lb/>Academic debates aside, businesses have already been embracing environmental and social issues even <lb/>without regulations and many of them recognise the business benefits <lb/>89 (McKinsey &amp; Co., 2009b, 2010; KPMG <lb/>International, 2009b, pp.12-14), and better ways to integrate them as a driver of innovation and to link to corporate <lb/>strategy are being explored (Porter and Kramer, 2006; Nidumolu et al. 2009). <lb/>As business takes initiatives to improve its performance and governments act to address market failures, which <lb/>includes both environmental (negative) externalities and of knowledge diffusion leading to innovation (positive <lb/>externalities) <lb/>90 by introducing regulation, the impact of regulation on innovation remains a valid area of research. From <lb/>a policy standpoint, integrating both economic and environmental considerations in regulatory decision-making is a <lb/>challenge, and it is a key feature of the green growth strategy that the OECD is developing (OECD (2010b), p.77). <lb/>iii) Climate change <lb/>94. <lb/>The climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 produced the Copenhagen <lb/>Accord, which includes the recognition that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees <lb/>Celsius, a collective commitment by developed countries to provide new and additional resources <lb/>approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010–12, and implementation and reporting of reduction and <lb/>mitigation of emissions. As this is not considered a full agreement, the negotiation process is expected to <lb/>continue toward the next conference in Mexico in 2010. On the other hand, the EU Emissions Trading <lb/>86 <lb/>Pre-registration was due on 1 December 2008, and registration for the first batch of chemicals will be due <lb/>on 30 November 2010. The final due date will be 31 May 2018. <lb/>87 <lb/>See cf. Paul Krugman, &quot; An Affordable Truth &quot; , the New York Times, 7 December 2009 (referring to an <lb/>impact of cap-and-trade system for sulphur dioxide in the United States in 1990). <lb/>88 <lb/>Jaffe et al. (1995), p.141, reports sectoral disaggregation of pollution abatement expenditures in the United <lb/>States in 1992. <lb/>89 <lb/>KPMG International (2009b) for chemical industry; McKinsey &amp; Co.

			<body>Scheme (ETS) has been in effect since 2005 and is scheduled to be expanded in 2013. A trial <lb/>implementation of an integrated domestic market for emissions trading started in Japan in October 2008. <lb/>Introduction of cap-and-trade system is also a priority of the current US administration. 91 <lb/>95. <lb/>The chemical industry is in a unique position as both a major industry sector in terms of energy <lb/>use and CO2 emissions and as a major contributor to deliver solutions to climate change (CEFIC (2008b); <lb/>KPMG International (2009b), pp.12-14). The chemical industry uses minerals and fossil hydrocarbons <lb/>(natural gas and oil) as raw materials which are transformed into more complex molecules and polymers. <lb/>Nearly 60% of total energy products (coal, oil products, natural gas, electricity and renewables) are used as <lb/>feedstock, and a little over 40% are used as fuel and power in the European chemical industry (CEFIC <lb/>(2009), p.32). The short-term profitability of the industry is directly linked to fluctuations in raw material <lb/>and energy prices, and in the long-run the sustainability of the current dependence upon non-renewable <lb/>fossil fuels as raw materials is increasingly questioned. <lb/>96. <lb/>Extensive studies are underway about the possible use of biomass as a new source of feedstock <lb/>with a view to reducing the industry&apos;s reliance on fossil fuels. 92 One study (Patel et al. 2006) on the <lb/>potential impact of use of biomass-derived feedstock to convert into organic bulk chemicals by means of <lb/>White Biotechnology (by fermentation or enzymatic conversion) found that up to two thirds of the current <lb/>non-renewable energy use for the production of the selected chemicals could be saved by 2050. Should this <lb/>projection become reality, significant technological breakthroughs are required as well as favourable <lb/>relative prices between fossil fuels and fermented sugar. <lb/>97. <lb/>The demand for a more sustainable use of resources and mitigation of climate change impacts, <lb/>alongside the competition from emerging economies, further adds to the importance of innovation (HLG <lb/>(2009), p.11). 93 Policy measures such as the ETS will give incentives to the search for emission reducing <lb/>technologies (OECD (2009b), pp.63-64). At the same time, technology policy to harness creation of <lb/>environmental-friendly technologies 94 and an open trade policy to facilitate adoption of environmental-<lb/>91 <lb/> &quot; And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make <lb/>clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill <lb/>last year. And this year I&apos;m eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. &quot; The State of the <lb/>Union Address by President Obama, January 2010. <lb/>92 <lb/>See e.g. European Commission (2008) (on biotechnology in Seventh Framework Programme of Research); <lb/>SusChem (2008). <lb/>93 <lb/>HLG (2009, p.25) pointed out the possibility of carbon leakage in chemicals sector should be taken into <lb/>account under the ETS Directive. On the other hand, OECD (2009b, Chapter 3) estimated that, while <lb/>insufficient participation in global carbon pricing policy can result in non-negligible carbon leakage (12% <lb/>leakage rates in 2050), broader participation will render the size of leakage much smaller (1.7%). Di Maria <lb/>and van der Werf (2008) further shows that induced technological change in energy saving technologies <lb/>will offset or at least mitigate the effect of carbon leakage. See WTO and UNEP (2009), pp.98-110 for a <lb/>survey of the issue and relevance to WTO rules. <lb/>94 <lb/>Aghion et al. (2009) stresses that, in order to foster emergence of green innovation, climate change policy <lb/>should combine a carbon price with high initial clean-innovation R&amp;D subsidies, rather than relying solely <lb/>on carbon price, given the current carbon market under the ETS where the carbon price is low, highly <lb/>volatile and not predictable. Popp et al. (2009, pp.4-5) also argues, based on various studies, that <lb/>environmental and technology policies work best in tandem. This is because while technology policy can <lb/>help creation of new environmental-friendly technologies, environmental policy should be in place to <lb/>encourage adoption of these technologies; on the other hand, it is suboptimal to raise emission tax above <lb/>the level necessary to account for the environmental externality, and targeted technology policy should <lb/>accomplish technology creation and spillovers. <lb/></body>

			<body>friendly products and technologies will also play essential roles. 95 For example, electric power plants in <lb/>India have been using domestically produced coal because imports were virtually banned to protect the <lb/>domestic industry, but emissions could have been reduced by using high quality imported coal (Khanna <lb/>and Zilberman, 2001). Another study further found that access to technologies, facilitated by openness to <lb/>international trade, further facilitates countries to adopt environmental regulation at lower levels of per <lb/>capita income (Lovely and Popp, 2008). International effort, including trade liberalisation through WTO <lb/>negotiations, can play an important role to accelerate the diffusion of climate change mitigation <lb/>technologies (Newell (2008), pp.13-14). 96 <lb/>4. Intellectual property <lb/>i) The role of intellectual property in the chemicals industry <lb/>98. <lb/>Intellectual property is an important resource generally and the availability of protection for this <lb/>resource can help to spur innovation; this is also the case with the chemicals sector. 97 For example, in basic <lb/>industrial chemicals, process technology is the key to cost leadership, and technology licensing has become <lb/>a business in its own right. Protection of brands is important especially for consumer chemicals where it <lb/>can contribute to brand loyalty and consumer protection. Various types of know-how (technical and <lb/>commercial) gained through experience are also valuable resources that merit protection. <lb/>99. <lb/>But the characteristics of the chemical sector make intellectual property all the more important <lb/>because of the relative ease of producing many types of chemicals once the necessary technologies are <lb/>known (Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.126). Therefore, firms seek to protect as intellectual property their <lb/>knowledge concerning the composition and formulation of chemical products. <lb/>100. <lb/>Technologies may be protected by patents or trade secrets, and both have been extensively used <lb/>throughout the history of the chemical industry, whereby the choice may depend on the nature of the <lb/>technology and the strategy in the specific situation. Some knowledge is relatively difficult to protect <lb/>through patents, particularly if it is difficult to codify. In some cases, disclosure requirements under patent <lb/>law may be seen as increasing the risk of imitation. A logical consequence of such considerations is for <lb/>firms to patent the technology which can be clearly articulated, and keep the rest as secret (Arora (1997), <lb/>p.393). In addition, development and defence of patents can be very resource intensive, which may <lb/>contribute to the lower propensity of smaller firms to patent their innovations. <lb/>101. <lb/>Nevertheless, patents play an important role in allowing the chemical industry to protect and <lb/>utilise the innovation. For example, wide spread technology licensing by SEFs is facilitated by patents <lb/>(Arora (1997), p.396). 98 Chemistry is one of the major areas of patented technology, representing 14% of <lb/>world patent applications (Figure 13).

			<body>102. <lb/>Three quarters of patent applications in chemicals are made by the United States, Japan and <lb/>Germany. While these countries lead the field with respect to patents, in recent years new entrants, such as <lb/>India, Korea and China, have gained weight especially in organic and fine chemistry. International R&amp;D <lb/>cooperation is gradually gaining ground in these areas, as the ratio of co-patenting (the patents with at least <lb/>one foreign co-inventor) stood at around 12% and has been edging up since the 1990s (Figure 14). There <lb/>are considerable variations in the pattern of co-invention across countries. In general, countries with larger <lb/>number of patents are lower in their ratio of co-invention. Countries that tend to be relatively low in their <lb/>tendency to co-invention include for example Japan, India and Korea; China is a contrasting example, with <lb/>a large volume of patent applications, whereby almost half resulted from co-invention (Figure 15). <lb/>103. <lb/>An econometric analysis (Appendix 2) shows that the number of patent applications has certain <lb/>correlations with export and import patterns, and that co-patenting is positively related to bilateral trade. <lb/>The dynamics between co-invention and trade flows appear to be different in different sub-segments, but it <lb/>may imply in practice that collaborative efforts leading up to patent application may foster trade flows, or <lb/>trade flows and collaborative innovation are mutually reinforcing and go hand-in-hand (especially in basic <lb/>materials). <lb/>104. <lb/>The high ratio of co-invention in China may be explained as a natural development, but it appears <lb/>that it may also be driven by policy. In China, preferential tax treatment is provided to those who offer <lb/>intellectual property, R&amp;D capabilities or advanced technology (PwC (2008a), p.5). On the other hand, this <lb/>is sometimes viewed as a requirement to establish a large scale R&amp;D facility, that is a significant cost that <lb/>comes with entry into China (PwC (2008a), p.12), which may inhibit inward investment. <lb/>ii) Problems with protection and infringement <lb/>105. <lb/>Since the TRIPS Agreement entered into force in 1995, developing countries have undertaken <lb/>significant reforms in their intellectual property systems (Park and Lippoldt (2008), p.18). For example, <lb/>patent protection for pharmaceuticals, food and chemical based products in India under the Patent Act of <lb/>1970 was limited to process patents; product patents were not available for these sectors. As this allowed <lb/> &quot; reverse engineering &quot; of drugs patented elsewhere, it effectively kept new drugs by multinationals out of <lb/>the Indian market, and this in turn gave the indigenous pharmaceutical production an opportunity to take <lb/>root (Prahalathan and Baruah (2007), p.47-51). The Patent Act of 2005 changed this domestic rule and <lb/>extended the scope of product patent to those sectors to be in line with the TRIPS Agreement (ibid., <lb/>p.64). 99 <lb/>106. <lb/>Despite these major improvements in statutory protection, implementation remains a source of <lb/>concern. 100 One survey shows that intellectual property infringement is one of the major types of economic <lb/>crime and it tends to result in big losses – over 30% of the relevant IP infringements imposed costs of more <lb/>than 10 million USD on western European companies. In the chemicals industry, a typical incident of <lb/>infringement happens when a business partner utilises technology obtained from another partner (e.g. <lb/>through a joint venture) and often involves production processes and technologies (PwC (2008b), p.3). <lb/>107. <lb/>In this respect, much attention has been directed to China (e.g. European Commission 2009b; US <lb/>Department of Commerce, note 100). Despite efforts to strengthen its intellectual property rights <lb/>99 <lb/>The Patent Act of 2005 contains an additional &quot; improved efficacy &quot; requirement for patentability of <lb/>pharmaceuticals, which is being challenged by Novartis, following a patent rejection under this rule in <lb/>2006. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2009. See e.g. Bate (2007). <lb/>100 <lb/>See e.g. US Department of Commerce, Protecting Your Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in China: A <lb/>Practical Guide for U.S. Companies <lb/>&lt;http://www.mac.doc.gov/China/Docs/businessguides/IntellectualPropertyRights.htm&gt;. <lb/></body>

			<body>enforcement since its accession to the WTO in 2001 and as technology transfer becomes more important <lb/>for domestic companies, multinational companies operating in China attach high importance to further <lb/>improvement of intellectual property protection. One survey shows that those multinationals often <lb/>purposefully exclude vital parts or designs from processes in China, or strive to maintain a marketing <lb/>reputation to make it difficult to replicate and undercut, and thus protect their intellectual property. Such <lb/>strategies have proven relatively effective. On the other hand, protection through recourse to patent and <lb/>trademark law or non-disclosure agreements with key employees are often used, but the survery shows that <lb/>their effectiveness does not necessarily match expectations (von Keller et al. (2005), pp.26-27). <lb/>108. <lb/>In the chemicals industry as well, multinationals have found it necessary to actively defend their <lb/>intellectual properties in China (KPMG International (2009c), p.15). Many foreign investors take such <lb/>precautions as creating firewalls between different steps of the production process, or refrain from sharing <lb/>key technologies in a joint venture (PwC (2008b), p.12). These additional efforts to protect intellectual <lb/>properties mitigate some of the potentially positive effects of statutory strengthening (e.g. on technology <lb/>transfer) and divert resources away from innovative activities. The impact is particularly serious for <lb/>smaller firms. <lb/>109. <lb/>Finally, counterfeiting of chemical products can have serious consequences (e.g. HLG (2009), <lb/>p.15). For example, counterfeit fertilisers and pesticides have caused vast damage to the environment, and <lb/>they are often difficult to distinguish from legitimate products even for experts. Cases have been reported <lb/>of the destruction of harvests in large areas in China, Russia, Ukraine and Italy due to the use of counterfeit <lb/>chemicals. There are also concerns for health and safety (OECD (2008d), pp.138 and 148; ECPA (2008)). <lb/>5. Recent developments <lb/>110. <lb/>Since the financial crisis in late 2008, the chemicals industry has been no exception in <lb/>experiencing a decline in trade (-24.6%, 2009Q2) 101 , although the rate of decline has been less than for the <lb/>manufacturing sector as a whole (-29.9%). This sudden turn in economic fortune provoked fears of <lb/>possible serious protectionist reactions, and against this background G20 leaders declared &quot; within the next <lb/>12 months, we will refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services, <lb/>imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent <lb/>measures to stimulate exports &quot; . 102 This was reaffirmed at subsequent summits in London and Pittsburgh in <lb/>2009. <lb/>111. <lb/>Active monitoring activities of trade-related measures ensued, most notably at the WTO. It <lb/>estimates that the value of total affected imports was 1% of the world trade (October 2008 – October 2009). <lb/>WTO et al. (2010) notes &quot; [i]n the period since September 2009, there has been continued slippage towards <lb/>more trade-restricting and distorting policies by many G20 members, although there has been a slight <lb/>slowdown in the number of measures implemented more recently compared with the period immediately <lb/>after the outbreak of the global crisis &quot; (p.20). In this general context, however, chemicals and plastics are <lb/>among the industries most affected by recently introduced trade-related measures (Tables 9-10), <lb/>comprising 8% of affected import value (other most affected industries include agricultural products, iron <lb/>and steel, footwear, textiles and clothing, consumer electronics, and motor vehicles and parts). Out of 247 <lb/>anti-dumping initiations between October 2008 and October 2009, metals have been the most targeted <lb/>goods followed by chemicals (58) and plastics (30). A similar pattern is observed with countervailing duty <lb/>investigations: out of 28 investigations initiated in 2009, 12 covered metals followed by plastics (4) and <lb/>chemicals (3). In terms of safeguard, among 27 initiations in 2009, chemicals (7) was the most affected <lb/>101 <lb/>The information in this and the following paragraphs is taken from WTO (2009b), except otherwise noted. <lb/>102 <lb/>Declaration: Summit on Financial Markets and World Economy, 15 November 2008, Washington. <lb/></body>

			<body>sector, followed by cement/glass/ceramics (6). It is worth noting also that this sectoral pattern of protection <lb/>is broadly consistent with the historical pattern. <lb/>112. <lb/>On export measures, WTO (2010c) observes &quot; an increasing trend in the use of export restrictions, <lb/>affecting in particular food products and commodities &quot; , while acknowledging that a few countries also <lb/>took measures to reduce the coverage of previously implemented export restrictions (para.46). 103 <lb/>113. <lb/>These recent developments exemplify both values and limits to the existing multilateral trade <lb/>disciplines. They have not stopped countries from taking these measures, but at the same time multilateral <lb/>rules have shown resilience in this period of exceptional economic stress and maintained credibility as a <lb/>multilateral &quot; insurance policy &quot; against the spread of protectionist reactions. This further underlines the <lb/>importance of these monitoring activities to ensure transparency and to seek an ambitious and balanced <lb/>conclusion of the Doha Development Round. 104 <lb/>Table 9.

			<body>V. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>114. <lb/>This study has highlighted the various linkages between trade and innovation in the chemicals <lb/>sector. First, the transfer of advanced technologies, both as embodied in capital goods as well as through <lb/>technology licensing, has been the key to the emergence of the chemicals industry as a global industry. In <lb/>particular, the SEFs (specialised engineering firms) have played a unique role especially in basic industrial <lb/>chemicals in technology spillovers, initially from the United States to Europe and to Japan and more <lb/>recently to emerging economies. <lb/>115. <lb/>Second, product innovation in the chemicals sector, especially in speciality and fine chemicals, <lb/>contributes to innovation in downstream sectors, and trade serves as an essential conduit to transmit such <lb/>innovations across borders. <lb/>116. <lb/>Thirdly, as a consequence of wider availability of technologies across the globe, technology <lb/>leaders in developed countries are under increasing competitive pressure from new competitors, which <lb/>induces further innovation. The basic industrial chemicals sector has undergone continuous re-organisation <lb/>with some companies now refocusing on speciality and fine chemicals. In speciality and fine chemicals, <lb/>the product life cycle has been markedly shortened, and innovative capacity is an important factor in <lb/>determining corporate performance in recent years. <lb/>117. <lb/>Fourth, exports can also be important not just to exploit economies of scale, but foreign contacts <lb/>can give suppliers innovative ideas, especially for speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals. <lb/>The increasing strength of emerging markets is a challenge but it is also offering opportunities for <lb/>innovation. <lb/>118. <lb/>Finally, joint ventures and cross border M&amp;A also work as channels of technology transfer. <lb/>China has been attracting foreign multinationals as partners in joint ventures in China, and Indian <lb/>companies are active in acquiring chemical companies in the developed countries. At least part of the <lb/>motivation is considered to be access to advanced technologies. <lb/>119. <lb/>In terms of policy issues, this study has addressed tariff, regulation and intellectual property. <lb/>Tariffs have declined substantially as a result of the Uruguay Round and autonomous tariff reductions, but <lb/>remaining tariffs are still non-negligible and work as a trade impediment. Successful conclusion of the <lb/>DDA negotiations is expected to play an important role in promoting trade liberalisation by bound tariff <lb/>reduction. Export restrictive measures on raw materials are also an important concern in this sector, and <lb/>proposals have been tabled to enhance transparency of these measures in the DDA negotiations. <lb/>120. <lb/>The chemicals sector is a heavily regulated sector both domestically and internationally. Under <lb/>WTO rules regulations may be considered legitimate if certain conditions are met. Many domestic <lb/>regulations have been notified to the WTO according to the procedure provided in the TBT Agreement, <lb/>and there have been over 1 600 notifications since 1995 in the chemicals sector. The impact of regulation <lb/>on innovation can go either way, and it is likely to be specific to the regulatory design. Many major players <lb/>in this sector have been pursuing regulatory initiatives to enhance data collection and to extend regulatory <lb/>coverage to existing chemicals in recent years. Their practical impact remains to be seen, since they are <lb/>still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In relation to climate change issues, the chemicals <lb/>sector is in a unique position as both a major sector in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions and as a <lb/>major contributor to deliver solutions to climate change. <lb/>121. <lb/>Intellectual property has particular importance in the chemicals sector because of the relative ease <lb/>of producing chemicals as soon as the necessary technologies are known. Throughout the history of the <lb/>chemicals industry, both patents and trade secrets have been used extensively depending on the nature of <lb/></body>

			<body>technology and strategy. Patents have been instrumental in facilitating technology transfer by licensing. <lb/>The practice of co-patenting is generally correlated with trade flows, indicating the possibility that trade <lb/>relations work as a precursor to more long term collaborative innovation. Infringement of intellectual <lb/>property continues to be a major problem that tends to incur high amount of losses to the intellectual <lb/>property holders. Many multinational companies operating in China have taken various measures to protect <lb/>their intellectual property, despite efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement by Chinese <lb/>government. <lb/>122. <lb/>Finally, as acknowledged at the OECD Council at Ministerial Level in 2007, to strengthen <lb/>innovation performance and its contribution to growth, a strategic and comprehensive cross-government <lb/>policy approach is required, and openness to trade is an essential element of the framework conditions that <lb/>are necessary to stimulate innovation. The OECD Innovation Strategy (OECD, 2010a) is an important <lb/>contribution to policymaking on broader aspects of innovation policy. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">APPENDIX 1. TECHNICAL NOTES <lb/>All data contained in the graphs are compiled by the Secretariat for the purpose of this study, except <lb/>otherwise indicated with the graph. Details of the data compiled by the Secretariat are as follows. <lb/>1. Trade Data <lb/>(1) All trade data are taken from the UN Comtrade in the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS). <lb/>Income groups are in accordance with the classification by the World Bank (2009), except that Chinese <lb/>Taipei has been added to the high income group for the purpose of this study. <lb/>(2) For Figures 1–5, data are based on HS1996, supplemented by individual country data based on <lb/>HS1992 for the year 1995 as well as for after 1996 where data based on HS1996 are unavailable in the <lb/>database. While this procedure minimises the bias due to idiosyncrasies in underlying data coverage for <lb/>each year, there still remain other biases. First, data in the WITS based on HS1996 are sometimes <lb/>transposed from raw data in HS2002 or HS2007, depending on the availability of raw data. Second, <lb/>transpositions between HS1992 to HS1996 (e.g. some transfer from Chapter 15 to Chapters 29 and 38), <lb/>which can affect trade values by HS Chapter, are disregarded in the calculation. Third, this procedure does <lb/>not necessarily ensure complete coverage of countries in the underlying data. For 2008, for example, data <lb/>for some larger players such as Saudi Arabia were not yet available at the time of data compilation. <lb/>(3) Categorisation in Figure 6 is based on the Broad Economic Categories (BEC). In this <lb/>classification system, majority of products under HS Chapters 28-39 are categorised into &quot; industrial <lb/>supplies n.e.s. (2) &quot; , &quot; consumer goods n.e.s.

			<body>APPENDIX 2. TRADE PATTERNS AND CO-INVENTION <lb/>a) The Model <lb/>To test the impact of tariffs and patent application on trade flows, the estimation has been based on <lb/>the gravity model with fixed effects after Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) adapted in Portugal-Perez <lb/>et al. (2009). The specification here is: <lb/>ln(import) ijt = ln(1 + tariff rates) ijt + ln(patent, importer) it + ln(patent, exporter) jt + ln(patent, co-<lb/>invention) ijt + D ij + x i + y j + (w t )+ e ijt <lb/>For importer i, exporter j and year t, with fixed effects in the importer (x), exporter (y) and product (w) <lb/>dimensions. D covers distance, common language dummy and contiguous (common border) dummy. The <lb/>estimation is done with respect to three sub-sectors. <lb/>Portugal-Perez et al. (2009) tested the impact of international standards and tariffs on trade flows with <lb/>similar control variables, but patent applications may also be associated with trade flows. If patent <lb/>applications represent export competitiveness, exporters&apos; patent application should have positive signs, and <lb/>if patent applications reflect absorptive capacity of foreign technology, importers&apos; patent application <lb/>should have positive signs. If cross-border co-invention (patent applications filed with foreign inventors) <lb/>represents global collaborative networks which cover both technological exchanges and trade in goods, it <lb/>should have a positive sign. Causation between co-invention and trade flows can further be tested by <lb/>changing the timing of co-invention (one-year lag and one-year lead) in the estimation. <lb/>(b) Data <lb/>Variables <lb/>Source and definition <lb/>Coverage <lb/>Imports <lb/>UN Comtrade in WITS. Gross import in thousand USD by HS <lb/>Chapters (29-39) in HS 1996. <lb/>66 larger importers in chemicals (HS28-<lb/>39) in 2008 (and 2007), of which 30 are <lb/>OECD members. <lb/>Tariff <lb/>UNCTAD/TRAINS supplemented by WTO/IDB, both in WITS. <lb/>Simple average of effective applied tariffs (AHS) by HS Chapters <lb/>(28-39) in HS 1996. Tariff rates for EU Member States are set as <lb/>the common external tariff, and tariff rates among EU Member <lb/>States are set to zero. <lb/>Patent <lb/>OECD patent database (2000-2006) for No.14 and 17 in <lb/>technology classification update of 2008. &quot; Patent &quot; is the number <lb/>of patent applications, and &quot; co-invention &quot; is the number of patent <lb/>applications done with at least one foreign co-inventor from a <lb/>specified country. <lb/>31 OECD members and 18 non-<lb/>members for total patent counts and co-<lb/>patenting with Belgium, Canada, China, <lb/>France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, <lb/>Korea, Netherlands, Switzerland, United <lb/>Kingdom and United States. <lb/>Distance, <lb/>Contiguous, <lb/>Common <lb/>Language <lb/>CEPII dataset. &quot; Distance &quot; is weighted by the geographic <lb/>distribution of population, common language is set one if a <lb/>language is spoken by at least 9% of the population in both <lb/>countries <lb/>While the technology classification for patens and HS classification for trade do not match precisely, <lb/>following correspondence is assumed for the purpose of this estimation. Note also that distinction between <lb/>process patent and product patent is not possible using this data. <lb/></body>

			<body>contemporaneous; and in basic materials chemistry they are mutually reinforcing. But in practice, when <lb/>collaborative activities leading up to joint patent application is taken into account, such efforts may have a <lb/>positive implication in fostering trade relations. <lb/>The results point to strong relationship between cross border collaborative networks and trade flows <lb/>within each technology areas, but it does not capture such relationship across different industrial segments. <lb/>Exporters&apos; patent application is generally positively correlated with trade flows, but statistically <lb/>significant only for basic materials. Importers&apos; patent application is generally negatively correlated with <lb/>trade flows, but statistical significance varies (statistically significant when estimated with &quot; co-patent <lb/>(lead) &quot; ). <lb/>Negative impact of tariffs is statistically significant 107 , and the signs of other control variables <lb/>(distance, language and contiguity) are also as expected.

Subscript s shows the industrial sector. <lb/>With these variables, two types of estimation are carried out: <lb/>(i) R&amp;D and Trade <lb/>• EXPORT ast = R&amp;D ast + w t + x a + z s <lb/>• IMPORT ast = R&amp;D ast + w t + x a + z s<lb/>(ii) Trade, R&amp;D and Protection <lb/>• TARIFF ast = EXPORT ast + IMPORT ast + R&amp;D ast + w t + x a + z s <lb/>And w, x and z are time, country and sector dummies. <lb/>(b) Data <lb/>Variable <lb/>Source <lb/>Coverage <lb/>Exports, Imports <lb/>STAN database <lb/>OECD members except Chile, Mexico and Luxembourg (and other occasional data <lb/>omissions due to data availability). <lb/>R&amp;D spending <lb/>STAN database <lb/>As above plus Chile, China, Israel, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, Chinese <lb/>Taipei and South Africa. <lb/>Tariff <lb/>TRAINS, IDB <lb/>Simple average effective applied tariffs. <lb/>Industrial sector <lb/>ISIC Rev.3: 15-16, 17-19, 20, 21-22, 23-25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 <lb/>EU <lb/>EU Member States are treated separately for &quot; R&amp;D and Trade &quot; and (2), and EU is treated as one in &quot; Trade, <lb/>R&amp;D and Protection &quot; .

It was positively associated in chemicals in 1990s but not any longer in <lb/>2000s. <lb/>Other factors than R&amp;D within the chemicals sector may have become more important for <lb/>comparative advantage of the chemicals in 2000s. For example, introduction of the fruits of R&amp;D <lb/>generated by other industries and/or from abroad through technology licensing or imports of superior <lb/>capital goods or intermediate goods, rather than domestic R&amp;D within the sector, may have become more <lb/>important. <lb/>(ii) Trade, R&amp;D and Protection <lb/>R&amp;D and exports are both negatively associated with tariff levels in all manufacturing sectors. In <lb/>other words, comparative advantage and the underlying R&amp;D capacity are associated with lower tariff <lb/>levels. But if both of them are controlled, R&amp;D tends to lose statistical significance. <lb/></body>

			<body>In chemicals in 1990s, the signs for R&amp;D and exports were both positive, but they turned negative in <lb/>the 2000s, but without statistical significance. <lb/>Imports have no statistically significant association with tariff levels in all manufacturing sectors. <lb/>Imports tended to have positive association with tariff levels in chemicals. <lb/>Positive association between R&amp;D and tariffs may imply a policy to compliment lesser R&amp;D capacity <lb/>by imports, and negative association may imply a policy to protect sectors with lesser R&amp;D capacity. But <lb/>from this simple test of association, clear evidence does not emerge in either direction. <lb/></body>
