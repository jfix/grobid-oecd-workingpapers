international migrants are women. The push and pull factors influencing this significant share of 
migration have typically been explained as a by-product of male migration: female migrants 
have been assumed to migrate mainly for reasons of family reunification as dependents of male 
migrants as wives, daughters or mothers. Over the years, the body of knowledge on the 
migration of women seeking better employment opportunities has increased, including research 
on topics such the role of gender discrimination in the workplace. Despite this growing 
knowledge, information on the links between migration and discriminatory social institutions 
has been neglected in the economic literature. The causes, processes and impacts of migration on 
women and men are expected to be different. By defining which decisions and behaviours are 
acceptable for each gender, as well as restricting women's access to power and resources. Hence, 
studying migration from a gender perspective implies looking beyond the differences in 
migration behaviour between men and women, such as the likelihood and type of migration, and 
to examine further the inequalities underlying those differences. This paper assesses how South-South migration and gender discrimination in social 
institutions mutually influence one another. Gender discrimination in both the origin and 
destination country appears to be an additional push and pull factor for female migrants. In 
addition, the relevance of international migration goes well beyond the movement of people as 
migration also represents a powerful mechanism to transmit ideas across borders. This 
contributes to a better understanding of why discriminatory laws, attitudes and practices persist 
and how social transformation and shifts in discriminatory social institutions can occur. In 
addition to the fulfilment of fundamental rights for women and girls, gender equality has 
recently been hailed as a 'breakthrough' strategy for promoting inclusive development and 
reducing poverty. Understanding the nature and extent of the obstacles to gender equality is 
therefore critical to designing effective policies to promote equality between men and women, 
and consequently, to improving development outcomes. Using the innovative OECD Development Centre's Social Institutions and Gender Index 
(SIGI), this paper provides evidence of a vicious circle. Higher levels of discriminatory 
institutions in origin countries hinder the likelihood of female migration, reducing the migrant 
share in origin populations, which consequently is too low to positively shift discriminatory 
norms towards greater gender equality. Mario Pezzini

institutions sociales et migration. D'un côté, le niveau de discrimination de genre dans les 
institutions sociales du pays d'origine et du pays d'accueil influence significativement la 
migration des femmes dans les pays du Sud. Ainsi les discriminations auxquelles les femmes 
font faces dans les lois formelles et informelles, les normes sociales et pratiques coutumières dans 
leurs pays d'origine constituent un déterminant supplémentaire à la migration : lorsque les 
discriminations dans les pays d'origine sont trop fortes, elles entravent les opportunités de 
migration des femmes et réduisent ainsi les flux migratoires Sud-Sud. En outre, le niveau de 
discrimination dans les institutions sociales des pays d'origine semblent aussi jouer un rôle 
important, les femmes étant attirés par des pays ayant des niveaux de discrimination plus faibles 
que dans leurs pays d'origine. Ce type d'inégalité n'a pas d'impact significatif sur les hommes, 
suggérant que les facteurs de migration diffèrent entre les hommes et les femmes. D'autre part, la migration apparait comme un acteur de transmission des normes sociales. 
En effet, les flux migratoires impliquent des changements culturels relatifs aux discriminations 
basées sur le genre dans les pays d'origine, en fonction du niveau de discrimination des pays de 
destination. Alors que les flux migratoires vers des destinations à faibles niveaux de 
discrimination favorisent l'égalité de genre dans les pays d'origine, ceux dirigés vers des 
destinations ayant des niveaux de discriminations élevés renforcent les inégalités homme-femme 
dans les institutions sociales. Cet article utilise un indicateur novateur développé par le Centre de Développement de 
l'OCDE mesurant les inégalités de genre dans les institutions sociales d'une centaine de pays : le 
SIGI (Social Institutions and Gender Index). Ces résultats sont robustes aux changements de 
spécifications et au contrôle des potentiels biais d'endogéneité et de simultanéité. Classification JEL: F22; O15; J16. Mots-clés: Migration Sud-Sud, Inégalités de genre, Institutions Sociales. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 7 ABSTRACT Using the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) from the OECD Development 
Centre, this paper provides evidence of the two-way relationship between gender inequality in 
social institutions and South-South migration. Discriminatory social institutions in both origin 
and destination countries are one additional determinant of female migration. Gender inequality 
appears to be both a pull and a push factor for migrant women. On one hand, higher gender 
discrimination at home reduces female emigration, since women's restricted opportunities and 
low decision-power limit their possibility to move abroad. On the other hand, lower 
discrimination in the destination country attracts female immigration. However, they have no 
significant impact on male migration, suggesting that male and female incentives to migrate 
differ. In addition, migration appears to be a driver of cultural change regarding gender 
inequality in opportunities, according to the level of discriminatory social institutions in the 
destination country. Migration towards countries having low levels of discrimination promotes 
gender equality in social institutions in the origin country, while migration towards countries 
having high levels of discrimination has the reverse effect, whatever the gender of the migrant. This paper contributes to a better understanding of why gender inequalities persist. These 
results are robust to changes in specifications and controls for potential endogeneity and 
simultaneity bias. JEL Classification: F22; O15; J16. Keywords: South-South migration, Gender inequality, Social institutions How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 8 © OECD 2015 I. INTRODUCTION There is widespread consensus that gender equality is a prerequisite for development, 
economic growth and poverty reduction. In recent decades, policy makers and researchers have 
increasingly turned attention and resources to closing gender gaps on key economic and social 
indicators. Discriminatory social institutions, defined as formal and informal laws, social norms 
and practices that shape or restrict the decisions, choices and behaviours of women (Jütting et al., 
2008), have gained prominence as a useful analytical framework to illuminate gender disparities. 
In parallel to the increasing focus on gender equality in social norms, the even bigger question of 
how to measure and shift them has come to the fore. The OECD Development Centre investigated these issues by building a unique composite 
index. The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) was the first attempt to measure 
discriminatory social institutions, which reduce female access to opportunities, resources and 
power (Cerise et al., 2012). Through its innovative focus on gender inequalities in opportunities, 
the SIGI provides additional insights on the root causes of gender inequality (Ferrant et al., 2014). 
Increasing attention on targeting discriminatory social norms and practices will not only 
empower women and secure their fundamental human rights, but also contribute to economic 
growth and development (Ferrant et al., 2015). Since gender is a social construct, which organises relationships between women and 
men, the causes, processes and impacts of migration on women and men can be considered as 
different. Hence, studying migration from a gender perspective implies looking beyond the 
differences in migration behaviour between men and women, such as the likelihood and type of 
migration, and to examine further the inequalities underlying those differences. While the literature focuses on the impact of gender discrimination in the workplace on 
female migration (Kanaiaupuni, 2000; Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012), it neglects the key role of 
discriminatory social institutions. By defining which decisions and behaviours are acceptable for 
each gender, as well as restricting women's access to power and resources, discriminatory social 
institutions affect migration decisions. Moreover, the relevance of international migration goes 
well beyond the movement of people as migration also represents a powerful mechanism to 
transmit ideas across borders. Using the SIGI, this paper is the first attempt to investigate this two-way influence 
between gender inequality in social institutions and migration. This exercise brings along a 
threefold contribution. First, it highlights the gender differences in migration determinants. The 
literature remains predominantly gender blind at cross-country level, assuming that migrants are OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 9 a homogeneous group having the same incentives to migrate. This paper provides evidence that 
differentials in discriminatory social institutions between origin and destination countries only 
influence female migration. Indeed, high discrimination in social institutions in the home 
communities restricts female emigration and low discrimination in the destination countries 
attracts female immigration, while they have no significant effect on men. Second, this paper contributes to the migration literature on  " transfers of norms "  
(Spilimbergo, 2009; Lodigiani and Salomone, 2012; Beine et al., 2013; Bertoli and Marchetta, 
2013). Migration may be a channel of norms transmission challenging gender inequality in social 
institutions at home when moving towards countries with low levels of discrimination. It can 
however reinforce discrimination when moving towards countries with high levels of 
discrimination. Finally, this paper contributes to the small literature exploring the neglected issue of 
South-South migration (Gindling, 2009; Facchini et al., 2013). While Naghsh Nejad and Young 
(2012) and Naghsh Nejad (2013) focus on institutionalised gender inequality in OECD countries, 
this paper considers migration flows between developing regions. This is not only because 
South-South migration represents more than 50% of migration stocks flows comparing to South-
North migration (Ratha and Shaw, 2007), but also because discriminatory social institutions in 
non-OECD countries are different and more restrictive than those in place in high-income areas 
(such as female genital mutilation, early marriage, inheritance laws). To investigate the two-way influence between gender inequality in social institutions and 
migration, several econometric strategies are performed. First, the empirical analysis adopts a 
Heckman two-step procedure to deal with the high occurrence of null bilateral flows in 
migration data and the selection process. Then, 2SLS estimators are used to overcome potential 
endogeneities, due to reverse causality and unobservables. Finally, the simultaneous influence of 
gender inequality on migration and vice versa is estimated using 3SLS estimators. The paper is structured as follows: the second section presents the theoretical links 
between gender inequality in social institutions and migration, and the third section the data. 
The fourth section describes the empirical strategy and the fifth section the empirical results. 
Finally, the last section concludes. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 10 © OECD 2015 II. THE EXPECTED LINKAGES BETWEEN MIGRATION 
AND GENDER INEQUALITY II.1. Discriminatory social institutions: A driver of migration Besides the economic reasons pushing men and women to migrate, such as the 
differences between the country of origin and destination in terms of income, unemployment 
rate, cost of living, etc., there is a variety of other determinants, including the education level of 
migrants, their networks and migration policies, borders, as well as climate and religion factors 
(Péridy, 2010). The migration literature has typically overlooked gender dynamics, assuming that 
most women migrate only for family reunification reasons as wives, mothers or daughters of 
male migrants (Zlotnik, 2003). However, the increasing magnitude of international migration in 
the recent decades led to a growing focus on women as independent migrants (Grieco and Boyd, 
1998; Cerrutti and Massey, 2001; Erulkar et al., 2006; Dumont et al., 2007; Docquier et al., 2009). 
Looking at the non-economic determinants of female migration, previous studies differentiate 
three broad categories of factors: individual factors including age, marital status, role and 
position in the family, educational status and employment experience; family factors including 
size, structure, status; and societal factors including the community norms and cultural values 
that determine whether a woman can migrate or not and if she can, how and with whom she can 
do it (Grieco and Boyd, 1998). The important role of gender inequality has been neglected by the literature. Few 
exceptions have looked at gender inequality as a driver of female migration, with a particular 
focus on discrimination in the workplace. Kanaiaupuni (2000) studies whether the determinants 
of migration differ by sex, using Mexico-US data. She finds that high-skilled women are more 
likely to migrate than high-skilled men or low and moderate skilled women. This may be 
explained by higher gender discrimination faced by women and few occupational rewards in 
their home country, and thus they benefit more than men from migrating internationally, 
whether their skill level is high enough to allow them to meet the job demand. Recently, 
Baudassé and Bazillier (2012) suggest that non-wage motivations for emigration include gender 
equality in the workplace. They assume that poor working conditions in source countries may be 
considered as a determinant of emigration. Therefore, when gender discrimination in the local 
labour market decreases, women's incentives to migrate decrease as well. They show that higher 
levels of discrimination in the workplace are correlated with higher levels of female emigration 
and lower levels of male emigration, suggesting a substitution effect between men and women 
within a given number of migrants. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 11 However, women's decision to migrate and their choice of destination may be also 
influenced by the discriminatory social institutions that impede their economic, political or social 
expectations. Gender norms may also affect male migration by defining their role in the public 
and private spheres. More specifically, discriminatory social institutions in origin countries may 
influence women's decision to emigrate in two ways. On one hand, they can be an additional 
determinant of emigration, stemming from women's need to escape gender-specific 
discrimination. For example, women may migrate to escape sexual violence and abuse; single 
women, widows and divorcees may migrate to escape social stigma; or girls may migrate to 
escape restrictions on their freedom, pressure to marry, or to remain chaste until marriage (Jolly 
and Reeves, 2005). There is evidence from South-East Asia of women migrating in order to 
escape from involuntary marriages (Lam and Hoang, 2010). Another study in Ethiopia finds that 
23% of migrant girls reported to have migrated in order to escape early marriage in their home 
communities (Erulkar et al., 2006). The same mechanism is expected for men. Gender norms in 
the household and society may push men to emigrate (Hofmann, 2010). For example, young men 
may leave the country to escape being forced to become soldiers; migration may be also seen as a 
rite of passage for young men (Jolly and Reeves, 2005). On the other hand, gender inequality in social institutions may constraint the  " capability "  
itself for women to migrate. 
1 For example, a girl who marries early is less likely to finish her education, which limits her employment opportunities (Cerise et al., 2013), rendering her more 
socially and financially dependent on her husband for a range of key factors, which include 
migration possibilities. In the Republic of Moldova, women report having less opportunity to 
migrate because of a lack of resources, which are generally more available to men (IOM, 2005). 
As Jolly and Reeves (2005) note,  " it may be less acceptable for women to move about and travel 
on their own " . This negative correlation between discrimination in social institutions and male 
emigration is not expected since patriarchal beliefs would be positively associated with 
emigration for men (Hofmann, 2010). These roles of discriminatory social institutions in migration processes have been totally 
disregarded by the economic literature. Few sociological and qualitative studies, however, have 
shed light on the relevance of gender norms in driving migration decisions. Diner (1983) is one of 
the first attempts to include discriminatory social norms into the possible explanations of 
women's international migration. Studying the Irish diaspora to the United States in the late 
nineteenth century, she finds that most of the migrants were women in search for better 
opportunities. Since the famine of those years made impossible for families to give dowry to each 
daughter, marriage was only possible for one daughter. The unmarried sisters, then, had few 
alternatives: employment opportunities in the countryside were scarce, and millions of young 
Irish women migrated to seek fortune and family in America. A recent contribution by Hofmann 1 As Sen (1999) has noted, economic factors are not the only determinants for human well-being and 
choices: desire for individual freedoms and rights to be respected and expanded also govern individual 
decision-making. Applying Sen's  " capabilities "  approach to female migration, it is interesting to 
explore how women's freedom (or lack of freedom) to  " achieve outcomes that they value "  may 
influence their decision to emigrate and their choice of destination. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 12 © OECD 2015 and Buckley (2013) stresses the possible negative role of social norms in limiting migration 
opportunities for women. The authors use individual interviews in Georgia to study the 
feminisation of migration that is currently taking place. Most respondents described female 
migration as  " unnatural, challenging the male role as breadwinner and female responsibilities 
for childcare and elder-care. Female migration is a crucial serious sociocultural loss, depriving 
individual families, and Georgian society as a whole, of women's natural contributions " . Likewise, gender and social norms in countries of destination can also inter-relate with 
women's decision to immigrate to a particular country, since women may be attracted by lower 
levels of discrimination. For example, in the 19th Century in the Dominican Republic, due to 
social stigma attached to women working outside of the household, the husband preferred and 
encouraged women to seek employment in the US, where it was deemed acceptable, even in the 
Dominican diaspora (Grassmuck and Pessar, 1991). In addition to preferences for gender 
equality, this attraction of lower discriminatory social institutions in the destination country may 
also be explained by lower discrimination in its labour market reflected in greater working 
opportunities for women (Martin, 2004). Mechanically, this is the reverse for men: when women 
are less discriminated, for a given level of job opportunities, men are less favoured. The hiring 
conditions are based on productivity instead of the gender of the job candidate. For a given level 
of labour demand, this may affect negatively the male probability to be hired. Hence, except if 
men have preferences for gender equality, higher discrimination in social institutions in 
destination countries is expected to be positively correlated with male migration. To summarise, while a positive effect of discriminatory social institutions in origin 
countries on male emigration is expected, the sign of the linkage for women is still ambiguous. 
Concerning the effect of gender discrimination in social institutions in host countries, a negative 
effect for female immigration and a positive one for male migration are expected. Nonetheless, 
the linkages between migration and gender inequality do not terminate here: migrants may be 
agents of change for gender discrimination in social institutions. II.2. Migration: A channel of norms transmission The chains of causality are complex and difficult to establish, making the explanation of 
gender inequality and its persistence challenging. The standard explanation focuses on economic 
growth as a determinant of gender inequality (Forsythe et al., 2000). The positive effect of 
economic growth is widely documented (see Dollar and Gatti (1999) and Ferrant (2015) among 
others) although income growth by itself is not sufficient. Gender equality also depends on how 
markets and formal/informal institutions have evolved, how growth has played out, and how all 
these factors have interacted with household decisions (World Bank, 2012). Interestingly, Rees 
and Riezman (2012) wonder whether globalisation may influence gender equality. Following this 
intuition and the migration literature on  " transfers of norms " , the paper assumes that beyond the 
movement of people, migration involves norm exchanges. For example, Spilimbergo (2009) 
describes how student migration towards democratic countries promotes democracy at home. In 
addition, migrants can also bring back home stronger entrepreneurial attitude (Piracha and 
Vadean, 2010; Demurger and Xu, 2011; Wahba and Zenou, 2012) or influence fertility decisions OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 13 (Beine et al., 2013; Bertoli and Marchetta, 2013). However, the role of migration as an agent of 
change for gender discrimination has been neglected by the economic literature. Few exceptions have looked at migration as a driver of women's empowerment. 
Lodigiani and Salomone (2012) investigate the linkage between transfers of norms through 
migration and women's political empowerment. Diaspora contributes to the propagation of 
political and gender equality values when migrants become aware of the fact that female political 
conditions at origin countries and their consequences on governance are worse than those 
experienced at destination. Hence, international migration to countries with higher female 
parliamentary shares significantly increases women's political empowerment in origin countries. Concerning other aspects of women's empowerment, several studies at micro or regional 
level have stressed the existence of possible channels of gender equality promotion through 
migration. For example, Hadi (2001) explains that male migration has a significant positive effect 
on women's empowerment. Changes in women's position are measured by three indicators: 
women's decision-making capacity; girls' education; and the practice of dowry. Findings show 
that male out-migration not only raise the standard of living of their left-behind kin through the 
injection of remittances, but also  " modify their social behaviour through the diffusion of secular 
ideas into the traditional values of the sending communities. "  Moreover, Hadi (2001) also shows 
that households with female migrant members are more concerned with the education of 
daughters. In Uttar Pradesh Paris et al. (2005) shed light on the consequences of male migration 
on gender roles in farming households. Interviewed women explain that the gender division of 
labour shifted, since they now have to take over several male-specific activities. Moreover, wives 
in migrant families state to have higher decision-making power, with the decision of how much 
money to invest and what crops to grow lying in their hands. Similarly, evidence from Nicaragua 
shows that fathers assume new gender roles when their spouses migrate, taking charge of the 
housework and children (Avellan, 2003). This paper contributes to the literature by assuming that South-South migration may 
foster gender equality in social institutions in the home community through three channels. 
Firstly, remittances and other benefits for the household and the community make the benefits of 
female emigration more obvious, which in turn creates incentives to increase the women's ability 
to migrate through improvement in women's access to opportunities, resources and power. For 
example, women who send remittances gain more respect within their family and community 
(Jolly and Reeves, 2005). Moreover, parents who rely on their daughters' remittances are less 
likely to force them to return home to marry (Temin et al., 2013)). Likewise, women gain financial 
independence and increased decision-making power when they emigrate (Peleah, 2007). Secondly, social remittances may translate in a shift in attitudes towards less 
discriminatory practices. Specifically, social remittance exchanges occur when migrants return to 
live in or visit their communities of origin, when non-migrants visit migrants abroad, or through 
the exchange of e-mails, blog posts and telephone calls (Levitt, 1998). In this way, migrants carry 
new ideas, practices and narratives which influence the social institutions and norms of their 
origin countries. Levitt (1998) records testimonies of Dominican Republic women who migrated How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 14 © OECD 2015 to Boston and modified their ideas about gender roles in response to their more active 
engagement in the workplace. They then transmitted these new norms to their home community 
and non-migrant women used them to create new versions of womanhood. Women who migrate 
tend to model their behaviour on women in destination countries, which proved to have positive 
effects on reducing violence against women in Moldova for example, as women tolerate it less 
from their partners (Peleah, 2007). Lastly, international migrants can alter the power structure within the household. 
Migration can challenge traditional gender roles when the absence of one spouse leaves the other 
one with both greater decision-making power and burden of responsibility and labour (Jolly and 
Reeves, 2005). In fact, in countries such as Mexico where men are far more likely migrating, left-
behind women often in-crease their decision-making power regarding daily-choices, since they 
need to make decisions for the family while the head of the household is away (Antman, 2011). 
This new position of the woman in the household may translate in greater access to public and 
political spaces, lowering overall discriminatory social institutions within the country. In 
addition, larger women's bargaining power creates a virtuous circle, since women are more 
likely to spend resources on daughters than fathers would (Duflo, 2003). Similarly, another study 
in Bangladesh finds that the emigration of men is positively associated with women's decision-
making capacity and the education of girls in migrant families (Hadi, 2001). Moreover, 
remittances have also been linked to increased female agency within family structures and a 
change in perceptions of gender roles. Women who receive remittances have more and better 
control of resources (Jolly and Reeves, 2005). Economic remittances may also be used to give 
women better access to health care, allow them to start their own business and keep girls in 
education for longer (Antman, 2012). In sum, migration may impact discriminatory social institutions. Since this effect implies 
a transfer of norms from host to sending country, the sign of the correlation is expected to differ 
according to the discrimination levels in destination countries. According to these expected links, 
male and female migration may have the same effect on gender inequality at home, with a higher 
effect of female migration due to the first channel of transmission. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 15 III. DATA III.1. Migration data The United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs (UNDESA) produces migration data which disaggregates international migrant stocks by 
sex, origin and destination countries for the period 1990, 2000 and 2010. 
2 To better capture gender dynamics in international migration, the change in migrant stocks observed between 2000 
and 2010 is used as a measure for migration flows. More precisely, the net migration flows by sex 
and country of origin in 2010 are used as dependent variable. To distinguish the effect of 
discriminatory social institutions between female and male emigration, sub-samples are used. Two main shortcomings of our migration data have to be acknowledged. Firstly, negative 
migration flows are also computed. These declining stocks are due to the fact that migrants may 
die, return to their home or even move to third countries. However, Beine et al. (2011) confirm 
that this approach still gives a reasonable approximation of the dynamics of migrant flows. 
Secondly, the UN database includes information only on legal migrants, leaving aside refugees, 
displaced people and illegal migrants. It is worthy to note that due to lack of available data, it is 
impossible to address illegal and involuntary migration at a macro level, although it may 
represent a large share of South-South migration. If anything, our results would be downward 
biased in magnitude, but there is no reason to believe that the sign of the relationship should be 
opposite for illegal migrants. III.2. The SIGI The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) produced by the OECD Development 
Centre measures discriminatory social institutions for non-OECD countries. 3 While other gender-
specific measures, such as the Global Gender Gap Index from the World Economic Forum or the 
UNDP gender-related indices (GDI, GEM and GII), measure gender inequalities in outcomes, the 
SIGI focuses on gender inequality in opportunities, seeking to capture the underlying causes of 
discrimination (Ferrant, 2014). An alternative proxy of social institutions would be the CIRI 
Human Rights Dataset (Cingranelli and Richards, 2010), which covers outcomes of these 
institutions. However, it does not distinguish between the different dimensions of social 2 See UNDESA (2013) for information on sources and construction. Available at: 
http://esa.un.org/unmigration/TIMSA2013/documents/MIgrantStocks_Documentation.pdf 3 The OECD provides only one observation for the 2012 SIGI, which captures discriminatory social 
institutions in non-OECD countries between 2000 and 2009. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 16 © OECD 2015 institutions, such as between what happens within the family and what happens in public life. 
Moreover, the main distinction of the SIGI is that it focuses on rights, as well as on social 
institutions that often are not codified in laws, but are based on norms and values, as well as 
attitudes and practices, that shape women's opportunities and decisions (Branisa et al., 2013). In 
addition, the SIGI is a more comprehensive measure considering other dimensions of gender 
inequality in social institutions. It is a composite index which scores non-OECD countries on the 
basis of 14 variables (Table 1). 4 The scale of the SIGI goes from 0, meaning low discrimination to 
1, high level of discriminatory social institutions. Table 1. The SIGI: Dimensions and variables Social Institutions and Gender Index

Political voice Variables are grouped into five sub-indices: 5 Discriminatory Family Code, which captures 
social institutions that restrict women's decision power within the family; Restricted Physical 
Integrity, which refers to restriction on women's control over their bodies; Son Bias, which 
measures intra-household biases towards sons and the devaluation of daughters; Restricted 
Resources and Entitlements, that includes restriction on access to, control of and entitlement over 
resources; and Restricted Civil Liberties, which captures social institutions that restrict women's 
access to public space and political voice. 6 Conceptually the SIGI does not take into account restrictions on men. However, it may 
still be a good measure of gender norms governing male behaviour and opportunities. In 
countries where social institutions highly discriminate against women, gender norms are 
strongly enforced. Consequently, in those countries with high SIGI, both men and women are 
compelled to behave as expected by social institutions. III.3. Other data Additional control variables include standard determinant of migration. Data on GDP per 
capita (in PPP), government expenditure and population in both origin and destination countries 
are taken from the Penn World Table. Since migrant flows measure the change in stocks over a 
decade, the ten-year average of the annual values of these control variables is calculated, in order 
to be consistent with the construction of our database. Ten-year averages are calculated also for 4 For more details, see Branisa et al. (2013) Cerise et al. (2012) and www.genderindex.org 5 The complete list of variables used to construct the SIGI is in Table A.2 in Appendix. 6 Complete SIGI ranking is in Table A.1 in Appendix.

average years of education of girls aged 15 or over (Source: Barro and Lee, 2012). Conversely, the number of conflicts occurred in a given country are calculated as a sum 
over a decade, using data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (Gleditsch et al., 2002). A 
measure of civil liberties is taken from the Freedom House's flagship publication '2013 Freedom 
in the World' (Freedom House, 2013). The index has a 1 to 7 scale (with 1 representing the 
highest and 7 the lowest level of freedom). For this variable, the 2010 value is taken, since civil 
liberties achievement is a progressive and dynamic process measured by a categorical variable 
that cannot be calculated with averages or sums. Time-invariant variables are obtained from the 
CEPII's Gravity Dataset (Head et al., 2010): contiguity is a dummy variable being 1 if two 
countries share a common border, common language is a dummy variable being 1 if a same 
language is spoken by at least 9% of the population in each country, and distance is taken as the 
bilateral distance between the two largest cities in the two countries, weighted by the share of 
each city in the overall country's population. Finally, the paper uses CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of all forms of 
Discrimination Against Women) date of ratification and religiosity as instrument for the level of 
discriminatory social institutions. 7 The religiosity variable refers to the share of population self-
declared as practising actively a religion. This variable comes from the COW database. 7 More precisely, the paper uses the difference between 2012 and the date of ratification to address 
intensity issue. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 18 © OECD 2015 IV. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY Three empirical strategies are used to assess the two-way relationship between 
discriminatory social institutions and migration. While equation (1) models the influence of 
discriminatory social institutions on female/male migration, equation (2) estimates the 
transmission role of migration regarding gender inequality in social institutions. Finally, the 
system (3) assesses the two-way relationship and simultaneous influence of gender inequality 
and migration. IV.1. Influence of discriminatory social institutions on migration A migration gravity model augmented by gender inequality First, a standard migration gravity specification is used to estimate the influence of 
discriminatory social institutions on female/male migration. The gravitational approach expects 
migration to be negatively linked to distance and positively correlated with population of origin 
and destination, income differential, language differential and contiguity (Lewer and Van den 
Berg, 2008; Clark et al., 2007; Beine et al., 2011; Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012). Indeed, migration is 
driven by a cost-advantages trade-off. Each migrant chooses to migrate where the costs are the 
lowest. Having lower distance between origin and destination countries, common language and 
border reduces the migration costs and increases the probability to move. Migration is also 
driven by the maximisation of utility, meaning that the opportunity differential between sending 
and receiving countries matters. It is necessary to acknowledge some criticisms that the gravity approach raises in both the 
trade and migration literature. Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) underline the lack of 
theoretical foundations of gravitational models. In fact, the theory states that the more a country 
is resistant to trade with all others, the more it is pushed to trade with a given bilateral partner 
(Anderson, 1979). The main implication is that flows between two countries is determined by 
relative trade barriers, otherwise said bilateral flows depend on the bilateral barrier between the 
two countries relative to the average trade barriers that both face with the rest of the world. 
According to the authors, the empirical literature does not consider this  " multilateral resistance " . 
As a consequence, empirical results may carry bias due to omitted variables, making impossible 
the comparison of different situations. A similar approach has been recently applied by Bertoli 
and Fernandez-Huertas Moraga (2012) to migration, leading to the development of the notion of 
 " multilateral resistance to migration " . In fact, bilateral migration flows do not depend only on 
the attractiveness of the destination country, but also on how this relates to the opportunities to 
move to other destinations. Studying the determinants of bilateral migration flows to Spain OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 19 between 1997 and 2009, the authors find that ignoring the multilateral resistance to migration 
biases the estimation. For example, the effect of GDP at origin is two thirds of that found when 
multilateral resistance to migration is not accounted. Despite the critics, the gravity equation proved to be one of the most stable relationship in 
economics (Chaney, 2013), and it is indeed useful in our empirical attempt of better understand 
the linkages between gender inequality and female/male migration. Thus the basic gravity 
framework is augmented by adding gender inequality in social institutions using the SIGI. In addition to the standard determinants of migration (GDP per capita in origin country, 
distance, contiguity, population of origin and destination countries, income and language 
differentials), our main specification includes female (male) education. Having access to 
education in the country of origin enhances the likelihood of migration (González-Ferrer et al., 
2013; Borjas, 1989) by reducing migration costs (Dustmann, 2011). To take into account the key 
role of working opportunities for women (men) in both origin and destination countries, female 
(male) unemployment rates are added. Labour is one of the main reasons of migration (Grieco 
and Boyd, 1998). Hence, working opportunities in the destination country are an important 
factor of migration. However, income differentials are not enough to understand the female 
(male) situation in a given labour market and to capture the complex process of gendered 
migration. Including unemployment rate by sex therefore controls for gender discrimination in 
the workplace. Moreover, a measure of networks in the destination country is included to deal 
with family reunification factors and diaspora effects. The role of peers is important since men 
and women from the same country of origin tend to migrate to the same destination country. 
This makes migration easier, as word-of-mouth communication helps to spread information 
about countries of destination: the bigger the diaspora, the smaller the psychological and 
integration cost of migration (Munshi, 2003). Various measures of networks are used: the stock of 
female (male) and total migrant in 2000. Finally, to control for family reunification, male (female) 
emigration flows in 2010 are included. The impact of discriminatory social institutions on female and male migration, 
respectively, is estimated using the following equation: 8 í µí± í µí±,í µí± = ∝ 0 +∝ 1 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 2 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 3 í µí² í µí±,í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± (1) where mi,j is the log of net female (male) migration flows between origin country i and 
destination country j, SIGI is the log of the Social Institutions and Gender Index, 9 xi,j the control 
variables and εi,j the error term. Control variables include GDP per capita in origin country, 8 All variables are expressed in logarithm 9 It is worthy to note than instead of using the log of the SIGI differential between the origin and the 
destination countries, the paper includes the two separately. This allows us to interpret the effect of 
social institutions in the origin country for a given level of discrimination in the destination one, and vice-versa. However, it does not exclude the interpretation of the differential since ln ( í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± ) = í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± − í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± looking at the absolute and relative effect is critical for policy recommendations. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 20 © OECD 2015 distance and contiguity between country i and j, population of countries i and j, income and 
language differentials, female (male) education, female (male) unemployment rates in countries i 
and j, male (female) emigration flows in 2010, migrant network and regional dummies. As a second step to understand which dimension of discriminatory social institutions is 
driving the results, equation (1) is estimated using each sub-index of the SIGI instead of the 
overall SIGI. This allows us to explore which dimensions have the greatest impact on female 
emigration. Empirical issues Nevertheless, two econometric challenges arise in estimating equation (1). First, bilateral 
migration data present a high occurrence of zero values, which may bias our estimations. 
Second, our gender inequality variable may be correlated with the error term, due to potential 
reverse causality, since gender inequality may be a determinant of international migration but at 
the same time migrants may shift gender attitudes in their origin countries. In addition, 
unobservable characteristics can affect both SIGI and female migration flows, leading to biased 
estimates. In order to address these econometric issues, the paper initially abstracts from the bias 
induced by the log linearization of gravity models, 10 using OLS. It then introduces a Heckman 
two-step procedure in order to account for the high occurrence of null migration flows. Finally, 
an instrumental variable approach is taken to address the potential endogeneity. The high occurrence of null migration flows It is worthy indicating that migration is very unlikely to occur among all country pairs. 
Therefore, our sample is characterised by a high occurrence of zero (approximately 75% of our 
South-South female sample). 11 This incidence of zero requires the use of a particular estimation 
strategy. While standard gravity models estimate a log-specification using OLS, this approach is 
limited since it forces to either exclude null migration flows from the estimates or to transform 
them by taking the log of the migration flows plus 1. Moreover, Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (2006) 
show the inconsistency of OLS estimates if the variance of the error term í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± depends on the 
covariates in equation (1). An alternative to generate consistent estimates even in cases of over-dispersion is the use 
of a Poisson regression model that relies on pseudo maximum likelihood estimates. However, 
the Poisson solution is nevertheless unfeasible for the selection analysis, while Baudassé and 
Bazillier (2012) provide evidence regarding the key role of gender inequality in the selection 
process of migrants. As previously noted, the authors assume two theoretical hypotheses with 
respect to the linkages between emigration and gender inequality. First, they consider gender 10 More precisely, the paper focuses on positive flows (96% of our observations) and adds 1 before to take 
their log. 11 Our sample contains 96 developing countries. Hence, 9 120 female emigration flows are observed but 
only 2 280 are positive. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 21 inequality as a push factor for female emigration. Second, they assume that gender inequality 
leads to a gender bias in a selection of migrants. Estimating by a Heckman two-step procedure, 
their results validate the second hypotheses rather than the first one. Following Beine et al. (2011) and Baudassé and Bazillier (2012), a Heckman two-step 
procedure is used. This technique has the advantages to explicitly account for a potential 
selection bias and to generate consistent estimates even in cases of high zero occurrence. 12 
Commonly used in presence of potential selection bias, the Heckman technique involves two 
steps: the first step assesses the probability of observing female (male) migrants between two 
given countries using a Probit estimator and an exclusion variable, while the second step 
quantifies the size of those migrating. Following Beine et al. (2011) and Baudassé and Bazillier 
(2012), diplomatic representation is used as exclusion variable in the selection equation. In fact, 
having a diplomatic exchange with a foreign country may reduce migration costs linked to the 
initial issuing of visas, increasing the probability to have positive emigration flows, but not the 
size of these emigration flows. Reverse causality and unobservable characteristics A typical puzzle of migration studies is due to endogeneity problems. For instance, in 
presence of reverse causality, estimations could be biased, since gender inequality in social 
institutions may be a determinant of female (male) migration, but conversely female (male) 
migration flows may also affect gender inequality in origin countries, due to a stream of new 
social norms, a change in the household bargaining power, and so forth. Similarly, results could 
be biased by the presence of omitted variables and especially unobservable country 
characteristics that affect both the probability of having female emigrants and the level of 
discriminatory social institutions in a country. These endogeneity issues result in biased OLS estimates, since covariates are correlated with the error termí µí¼ í µí±,í µí± . In order to allow consistent estimation, an instrumental variable approach is applied. A 
good instrument may still lead to consistent parameter estimates. In order to be valid, 
instruments must be uncorrelated with the error term in the explanatory equation and have no 
direct effect on female (male) migration. To be relevant, the instrument must be correlated with 
the endogenous independent variables, that is the SIGI. Previous studies on gender inequality 
rarely shed light on the possibility of endogeneity issues and the validity of the instruments to 
solve them. A prominent exception is represented by Dollar and Gatti (1999), who instrument 
gender inequality in a growth equation by religious affiliation and civil liberties. However, some 
doubts have been raised by the literature regarding the exogeneity of religion and civil liberties. Following Ferrant (2015), the CEDAW ratification date is used as instrumental variable 
for discriminatory social institutions and controls for religiosity and civil liberties are added. 
Indeed, the CEDAW ratification date can be considered as a public commitment and recognition 12 Moreover, Beine and Docquier (2009) claim that the two estimation strategies, that is Heckman and 
Poisson, provide similar results and are equivalent. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 22 © OECD 2015 of gender equality as a human right. Ratification implies recognition of the legitimacy of 
reducing gender inequality. It leads to changes in government behaviour toward gender 
inequality in social institutions and, for example, to changes in law regarding women and 
discrimination, to implementation of incentives in order to promote law enforcement or 
punishments. CEDAW can be a powerful tool for change when legislative and other measures to 
protect women's rights are undertaken once states ratify CEDAW. For example, Bangladesh now 
prohibits sexual harassment, thanks to a milestone decision issued in 2009 by the High Court. 
Thanks to a training manual titled  " CEDAW Made Easy " , empowering traditional leaders in 
Cameroon to use the Convention to bring about concrete improvements in the lives of women in 
their communities, they are changing traditional practices that are harmful to women. The 
CEDAW denounced the prevalence of early marriage in several countries, some of which have 
thus changed their legal age of marriage, which in turn has reduced the prevalence of such 
practices: the average prevalence of early marriage across developing countries has decreased 
from 21% in 2009 to 17% in 2012 (Cerise et al., 2012). Good instruments often come from policy changes and an earlier date of ratification can 
be assumed to be linked with a greater and deeper attention to gender equality within a country. 
This paper considers the CEDAW ratification date as good predictor of the level of 
discriminatory social institutions. However, it assumes that this date has no effect on female 
(male) migration. Then, the exogeneity of female (male) migration flows per capita is rejected by 
the Wu-Hausman test at the 5% level. 13 Finally, the validity (i.e. Cov(CEDAW, í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± ) = 0) and the 
relevance (i.e. Cov(CEDAW, SIGI) ≠ 0) of this instrument are tested. This instrument is 
significantly correlated with the endogenous variable, as indicated by the first step of the IV 
estimations (Table 2). Moreover, simple estimation of the SIGI including additional controls and 
instruments result in a relatively high partial R. Finally, the paper checks that instrumental 
regressions are not null with F-statistic higher than 0.10, suggested by the rule of thumb (Stock 
and Yogo, 2002). Even if the exogeneity of the instrument is hard to test, performing female 
(male) emigration regressions do not provide evidence of correlation between error term and the 
instrument. Indeed, the null hypothesis that the CEDAW coefficient is equal to zero when the 
residuals are regressed is not rejected. IV.2. Influence of migration on gender inequality in social institutions In this second model, the effect of migration on gender inequality in opportunities is 
estimated. The paper assumes that migration is a channel of idea transmission and may impact 
the level of gender inequality in social institutions in origin countries. While migration flows 
could capture size effect, the share of migrants in total population is used to measure migrants' 
influence on discriminatory social norms, excluding population size effects. Whatever the 
direction of this influence, larger shares of migrants are correlated with greater probabilities to 
transmit new ideas. 13 The Durbin-Wu-Hausman score has a p.value of 0.028 and 0.023 for women and men, respectively. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 23 However, using shares allows taking into account only the weight of migrants in a given 
country. Unfortunately, the  " quality "  of migrants is not captured. Yet, according to his/her social 
position, a migrant could affect differently social norms. For example, it would be expected that a 
male tribal chief would have higher impact on social institutions, due to his leadership, implying 
higher potential transmission power. This assumption is consistent with our previous example in 
Cameroon, where traditional leaders are an agent of change regarding gender equality. Rather 
than distinguishing social position, female and male migrants are distinguished. According to 
the theoretical links, the female migration effect is expected to be higher. Finally, the paper 
divides migrant shares by level of discriminatory social institutions in destination countries. In 
fact migrants learn those social norms in place at destination, leading to heterogeneous effects 
according to the area where the migrant moves. For instance, Beine et al. (2013) demonstrate that 
returnee migrants are more likely to have fewer children than non-migrant households if they 
migrated towards lower-fertility destinations, whilst Bertoli and Marchetta (2013) find opposite 
results when looking at returnees from Egypt who have worked in high-fertility Arab countries. The following equation is then estimated, where the SIGI in origin countries is the 
dependent variable: í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± = í µí»½ 0 + í µí»½ 1 í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ + í µí»½ 2 í µí² í µí± + í µí¼ í µí± (2) The interest variable í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ is alternatively the share of total, female and male migrants in 
the total population in 2010. The set of additional controls í µí² í µí± includes GDP per capita (in log), 
share of population self-declared as religious practising, CEDAW date of ratification, female 
education and level of civil liberties. Finally í µí¼ í µí± is the error term. The inclusion of these controls is justified by the gender literature. The income growth is 
expected to reduce gender inequality by loosening constraints, improving market opportunities, 
promoting market mechanisms, increasing household available resources and so on (See Dollar 
and Gatti, 1999; Forsythe et al., 2000; World Bank, 2012; Ferrant, 2013 among others). Religious 
affiliation and civil liberties are included following Dollar and Gatti (1999). They show that, to a 
large extent, gender inequality can be explained by religious preference and underlying 
characteristics of societies, such as the extent of civil liberties. The self-declared religious practice 
is used here, without distinguishing religion. The paper assumes that higher share of population 
declared as practising a religion higher traditional gender roles are enforced leading to higher 
discriminatory social institutions, whatever the religion concerned. On the other hand, high 
restriction on civil liberties is correlated with high discrimination on women. Moreover, as 
previously mentioned, an earlier ratification of the CEDAW is expected to be positively 
correlated with gender equality. Finally, greater access to education constitutes a way to move 
away from gender discrimination. As shown in the previous model, gender inequality in origin countries is a factor 
explaining female migration flows. Hence, looking at the effect of migration on gender inequality 
raises endogeneity issues. In addition, omitted variables could have an impact on both the 
dependent and the interest variables. For example, a development programme implemented by 
an international organisation in order to develop female employment would reduce both gender How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 24 © OECD 2015 inequality and female migration. Firstly, higher job opportunities for women lead to lower 
gender gaps in education. Secondly, if women have more job opportunities at home, they have 
less incentive to migrate for labour reasons. To tackle endogeneity issues, the paper follows 
McKenzie and Rapoport (2011) by instrumenting the migrant share in 2010 with historical 
migration flows (specifically, migrant share in 2000). 14 While previous migration flows could 
affect current ones through network effects or persistence of incentives to migrate, it has no effect 
on the level of current discriminatory norms, except through the current migration share or the 
previous levels of discrimination in the SIGI. The instrumental strategy assumes that the 
instrument is valid (i.e. Cov(Mi,t−1, í µí¼ í µí± ) = 0) and relevant (i.e. Cov(Mi,t−1, Mi,t) ≠ 0). This instrument is 
significantly correlated with the endogenous variable, as indicated by the first step of the IV 
estimations and F-statistics are higher than 0.10 (Tables (6) and (8)). The exogeneity is rejected for 
all dependent variables at 5%. IV.3. The two-way relationship between gender inequality and migration In a last step, feedback is tested. The paper assesses the two-way relationship between 
migration and gender inequality by dealing with the simultaneous determination of gendered 
migration flows and level of discriminatory social institutions. Econometrically, this simultaneity 
issue implies correlation between error terms εi,j and µi that could be taken into account using a 
3SLS estimator. The system (3) includes equations (1) and (2), where all model parameters are 
jointly estimated. { í µí± í µí±,í µí± = ∝ 0 +∝ 1 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 2 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 3 í µí² í µí±,í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±,í µí±

(3) 14 More precisely, an IV and IV-probit estimation are performed, in order to assess the probability to have 
positive female / male flows between two given countries, controlling for potential endogeneities. The 
use of an IV-probit model is preferred, both because it solves the problem of the high occurrence of 
zeros, and because it is coherent with the Heckman results. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 25 V. EMPIRICAL RESULTS V.1. Influence of discriminatory social institutions on migration First, let us focus on female migration flows. Tables 2 and 3 present the estimated effect of 
SIGI in both origin and destination countries on female migration flows. The OLS estimates are 
provided in Table 2 column (1), Table 2 columns (2) and (3) report the estimates using the two-
step Heckman approach and Table 3 those using instrumental variable. In most of our specifications, control variables are significant and with the expected sign. 
Income differential results positive, representing the economic attractiveness of the foreign 
economy. Populations in both origin and destination countries have positive signs, in accordance 
with the gravitational forces of demographic pressure. Conversely, the distance between the two 
countries is negatively correlated with migration flows, due to increasing migration costs. Both 
geographical (i.e. contiguity) and cultural (i.e. common language) proximity have the expected 
positive sign, since migrants tend to move in countries that are closer to their homes and where 
they can easily communicate. Women's years of education has a significant effect confirming that 
being educated increases the probability to migrate. 
15 Unemployment rates in origin and destination countries are statistically significant suggesting that differentials in job opportunities 
matters. 16 It is worthy to note the significance of the exclusion variable in the Heckman 
procedure, namely diplomatic exchange. The positive sign indicates that the presence of a 
diplomatic representation in a foreign country is often seen as prerequisite for engaging in legal 
cross-border migration: the probability of having female migrants increases by 26% in presence 
of diplomatic exchange. Male migration flows in 2010 are positively correlated with female 
flows. The interpretation is twofold. First, this can be related to family reunification and 
dependent migration: women and men migrate from the same country towards the same 
destination in the same decade due to family relationship. Second, it may capture network 
effects. As male peers have already migrated towards this destination, female migration flows 
are higher. 15 NB: only for the IV estimates. 16 NB: except for the Heckman estimates. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 26 © OECD 2015 Table 2. Impact of SIGI on female migration (OLS and Heckman estimates) (1)

exchange. For sake of clarity other additional controls (such as regional dummies) are not presented here. ***, **, and * 
represent 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. The impact of the discriminatory social institutions in both origin and destination 
countries on female migration is significant and negative in all specifications. It suggests that 
higher discrimination is related to lower female emigration. Gender inequality appears to be 
both a pull and a push factor for migrant women. On one hand, higher gender discrimination at OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 27 home reduces female emigration, since women's restricted opportunities and low decision-
power limit their possibility to move abroad. On the other hand, lower discrimination in the 
destination country attracts female immigration. Interestingly, using a Heckman two-step procedure gives more details on this 
relationship. 17 In Table 2, estimated effects of discriminatory social institutions on the probability 
to have female migration flows between two countries (column (3)) and the magnitude of these 
flows (column (2)) are presented. While the levels of SIGI in origin and destination countries 
have no significant impact on the extent of female migration flows, they exhibit negative and 
significant coefficients in the selection equation. These results suggest that gender inequality in 
social institutions only affects the probability to migrate. Discrimination against women in both 
origin and destination countries plays a key role in the selection process of migrant, which is 
consistent with previous findings (Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012). Table 3. Impact of SIGI on female migration (2SLS estimates) Panel A. Second-stage: Dependent variable = Migration (1)

exchange. For sake of clarity, other additional controls (such as regional dummies) are not presented here. ***, **, and * 
represent 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. Finally, several checks are performed in order to test the robustness of our findings 
(Table 4). First, migration networks are included in the specification (row (2)) since it reduces the 
cost of migration. Then, the differential in government expenditure is added to take into account 
the effect of social allowance and public services provision on migration (row (3)). Finally, a 
conflict variable in origin countries (row (4)) and the level of civil liberties at home (row (5)) are 
included to control for the effect of political situation on migration dynamics (Péridy, 2010). In all 
these cases, even including all these variables, the results maintain their statistical significance. Regarding male migration, the impact of gender inequality in social institutions is not 
significant whatever the estimators used (Table A.3 in Appendix). It suggests that male 
migration is not sensitive to the level of discrimination in the origin countries, neither in the 
destination. The interpretation is twofold: i) men's decision to migrate is not related to the level 
of gender discrimination in social institutions; or ii) the SIGI is not able to capture social pressure 
on male behaviour and choices. This finding highlights that male and female incentives to 
migrate differ, suggesting gender-sensitive migration factors. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 29 Table 4. Robustness checks (Heckman estimates) (1)

represent 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. Further analysis disaggregates the SIGI in the origin countries into its five sub-indices, in 
order to identify which one drives the results (Table 5). 18 Discrimination within the family and 
restricted civil liberties at home appear to be the main drivers of the gender inequality-migration 
nexus. In particular, while discriminatory family code confirms our previous results on the 
negative relationship between gender inequality and female migration in the selection equation, 
restricted civil liberties exhibit a positive effect. This may be explained by lower access to the 
public sphere encouraging women to escape elsewhere to enjoy more civil liberties. Conversely, 
high discrimination at the family level may put more pressure and control over women's actions, 18 For the sake of simplicity, results from the second step are presented in columns. In the first step, four 
out of five dimensions attract significant coefficient. The son bias dimension was insignificant. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 30 © OECD 2015 and limit even their ability to move. It is worthy to note that both sub-indices have a significant 
and negative effect on the extent of female migration, meaning that high levels of discriminatory 
social norms in the family and in the public space reduce not only the probability to have female 
migration but also the size of those women who get to migrate. Table 5. Impact of SIGI sub-indices on female migration (Heckman two-step procedure) (1)

Then, the singly significant dimensions were introduced together. Variables are expressed in log. Additional control 
variables are included: distance, contiguity, population of origin and destination countries, income and language 
differentials, female education and female unemployment rates in origin and destination countries. The exclusion 
variable in the selection equation is diplomatic exchange. ***, **, and * represent 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, 
respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. V.2. Influence of migration on gender inequality in social institutions Table 6 presents the estimated effects of migration on gender inequality in social 
institutions (OLS estimates in columns (1)-(3), 2SLS estimates in columns (4)-(6)), while Table 7 
presents the heterogeneous effect by levels of discrimination in the destination country. Control variables exhibit the expected signs. For example, the higher the GDP per capita 
and female education, the lower the gender inequality. Moreover, countries having ratified the 
CEDAW earlier have lower SIGI scores that are lower discriminatory social institutions. The level 
of civil liberties is quite related to the level of gender inequality in social institutions. Countries 
where civil liberties are restricted are also those where discriminatory social institutions are high, 
while religiosity does not seem to have significant impact. Let us initially focus on the average transmission role of migrant: larger shares in total 
population promote gender equality in social institutions, whatever the gender of the migrant. 
However, following our theoretical expectation, the female migration effect is significantly 
higher. 19 19 The Wald test is performed to check the statistical difference between the two coefficients. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 31 Table 6. Impact of migration on SIGI (OLS and 2SLS estimates) (1)

discriminatory social institutions reduce gender inequality in social institutions. On the opposite, 
higher migrant shares towards countries with high levels of discrimination reinforce gender

average education, civil liberties and regional dummies. ***, **, and * represent 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, 
respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. V.3. The two-way relationship between gender inequality and migration In the last step, the paper assesses the bidirectional relationship between female 
migration and the level of discriminatory social institutions, measured by the SIGI. Table 8 
considers the simultaneous estimation of equations (1) and (2). 20 Controlling for potential 
simultaneities confirms the previous results: the differential in discriminatory social institutions 
between the sending and the receiving countries is an additional determinant of migration, while 
migration is an agent of change regarding gender inequality in opportunities. This exercise 
emphasises the existence of a vicious circle: higher discriminatory social institutions in origin 
country reduce the likelihood of having female emigration, while female emigration is too low to 20 For sake of brevity, the insignificant male regressions are not reported. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 33 have a positive effect on gender equality. These results have some critical policy implications. 
Indeed, reducing gender inequality in social institutions increases the probability to have female 
migrant and then to benefit from its positive effect on gender equality promotion. Table 8. Bidirectional relationship between female migration and SIGI (3SLS estimates) (1)

gender dynamics of social institutions. This paper assesses the two-way linkages between 
gendered migration and discriminatory social norms, leading to relevant findings on the 
interaction between social institutions, gender and South-South migration. On one side, estimates show that discrimination against women in social institutions in 
both origin and destination countries plays a key role in the selection process of migrants. While 
gender inequality in social norms constrains female emigration, it has no effect on male 
emigration, suggesting that men and women's incentives to migrate differ. Hence, although the 
broader structural causes of emigration appear to be gender-neutral, the role of gender inequality 
in social institutions is not. In addition to standard determinants, discriminatory social 
institutions influence female migration patterns. This is critical in order to understand the role of 
social institutions in female decision-making. By limiting their access to opportunities, resources 
and power, discriminatory social institutions restrict women's capabilities to achieve their 
migration wishes. In particular, discrimination within the family and restricted civil liberties 
drive our findings. On the other side, migrants are agent of change by influencing gender relations. In 
particular, migration may either entrench gender inequality in social institutions or challenge 
them, according to the level of discriminatory social institutions in the host country. While larger 
shares of migrants towards low or moderate discriminatory countries are linked to greater 
gender equality in social institutions in home communities, migration towards high 
discriminatory destinations has the reverse impact. Both men and women are agent of change, 
although the effect of female migrants is significantly higher. Interconnecting the two directions of the relationship emphasises the existence of a 
circular pattern: high gender inequality in social institutions at origin constraints female 
migration, but at the same time the share of female migrants is too low to positively shift 
discriminatory norms towards greater gender equality. However, drawbacks limited our research. In particular, sex-disaggregated data on 
international migration is still scarce and seldom collected, with short time coverage. Similarly, 
gender inequality in social institutions has started to be measured only recently, not allowing for 
a panel data analysis: the SIGI is only available for one year limiting our empirical study to a 
cross-country analysis. Although these results are robust to specifications changes and controls 
for potential endogeneities and simultaneities, the interpretation of this data-driven analysis OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 DEV/DOC(2015)1 © OECD 2015 35 should be cautious concerning its causality. Since it is not possible to control for year and country 
specific effects, findings may be partly due to omitted variables. Finally, at the micro level, more 
research is required in order to collect data on immigrants and return migrants to allow for an 
estimation of the spillovers on family structures in origin countries. Nevertheless, this paper is a 
first contribution to the literature highlighting the bidirectional nature of the migration-gender 
nexus and the importance of discriminatory social institutions. How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? DEV/DOC(2015)1 36 © OECD 2015 APPENDIX Table A.1: SIGI 2012 ranking Country
