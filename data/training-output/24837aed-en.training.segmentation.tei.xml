Income and wealth inequality have gradually declined since <lb/>the mid-1970s. With the &quot; people economy &quot; at the centre of Malaysia&apos;s ambition to become a high-income <lb/>country by 2020, the focus is shifting to the challenges of relative poverty and achieving sustainable <lb/>improvements in individual and societal well-being through inclusive growth. This shift would be aided by <lb/>reforms in several policy areas where Malaysia may compare favourably within its region but less so <lb/>relative to OECD countries. This includes reforms to increase access to quality education, provide <lb/>comprehensive social protection, raise the labour force participation of women and older persons, maintain <lb/>universal access to quality public healthcare, improve pension system sustainability and adequacy and <lb/>move towards a tax and transfer system that does more for inclusiveness. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Assessment of Malaysia <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-malaysia.htm). <lb/>JEL classification: E20; H20; H50; I0; J0; P48. <lb/>Keywords: healthcare, inclusive growth, inequality, labour market, participation, pensions, regional <lb/>development, social protection, tax, transfer <lb/>************* <lb/>Promouvoir une croissance inclusive en Malaisie <lb/>La Malaisie a suivi une trajectoire de développement comparativement équitable, éliminant largement <lb/>la pauvreté absolue et réduisant considérablement l&apos;inégalité ethnique.

			<body>FOSTERING INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN MALAYSIA <lb/>By Stewart Nixon, Hidekatsu Asada and Vincent Koen 1 <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Growth can be more inclusive by pursuing policies that enable improvements in a country&apos;s living <lb/>standards while sharing gains more equitably across the population. Inclusive growth incorporates a <lb/>focus on relative -not just absolute -income and wealth inequality, and on well-being, which depends <lb/>on both monetary and non-monetary conditions, such as access to quality education, employment, <lb/>housing and healthcare. <lb/>From a highly unequal society on attaining independence in 1957, Malaysia has substantially <lb/>reduced inequality and poverty through decades of strategic planning with stability and inclusiveness at <lb/>their core. The New Economic Policy (1971-90) sought growth with equity and national unity, tackling <lb/>poverty by creating jobs for all Malaysians irrespective of race while seeking to reduce ethnic <lb/>identification with particular economic activities. The National Development Policy (1991-2000) <lb/>continued to emphasise the need for growth while increasing the focus on human capital development and <lb/>the eradication of hard-core poverty. The National Vision Policy (2001-2010) continued earlier <lb/>policies around the vision of becoming a fully developed nation by 2020, aiming to build a <lb/>competitive nation with an equitable, unified and resilient society. Most recently, the New Economic <lb/>Model (since 2010) set targets for achieving high income status, inclusiveness and sustainability, with <lb/>the Government and Economic Transformation Programmes and the 10th and 11th Malaysia plans <lb/>providing whole-of-government reform blueprints towards achieving this vision. <lb/>Making growth more inclusive is fundamental to Malaysia&apos;s efforts to become a high-income country, <lb/>with the &quot; people economy &quot; at the centre of its development vision. Having eradicated all but a few pockets <lb/>of absolute poverty through decades of strong economic growth, Malaysia&apos;s focus is shifting to the <lb/>challenges of relative poverty and sustainable improvements to individual and societal well-being. <lb/>Accordingly, the 11th Malaysia Plan prioritises policies that enhance well-being with a particular focus on <lb/>increasing the living standards of the bottom 40% of households by income (B40). <lb/>The following section provides an overview of the current state of inclusive growth in Malaysia. The <lb/>subsequent ones identify priority areas where further reforms would enhance well-being. This <lb/>p a p e r complements the productivity-boosting reforms, with many of these reforms also beneficial to <lb/>fostering inclusive growth (Asada et al., 2016). Reforms that provide universal access to quality <lb/>education and skills training provide an obvious example, and so do reforms that enhance innovation, <lb/>competition and SMEs. Innovative businesses exhibit higher employment growth that benefits both high-<lb/>and low-skilled workers. A robust competition environment spurs innovation and facilitates the <lb/>entry and expansion of new businesses (de Mello and Dutz, 2012). Openness to trade and investment and <lb/>strong competition policies can increase the availability of lower priced essential goods and services for <lb/></body>

			<body>lower-income households, such as food, clothing and telecommunications. In many respects <lb/>therefore, productivity and inclusiveness enhancing policies go hand-in-hand. <lb/>Poverty, income and wealth inequality <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s sustained rapid real GDP growth of 6.4% per annum from 1970 to 2015 reduced the <lb/>incidence of absolute poverty from 49.3% to 0.6% (World Bank, World Development Indicators). <lb/>Some challenges remain, with higher rates of absolute poverty in rural areas (1.6%), for children under <lb/>15 (1.7%) and for particular ethnic groups (Orang Asli 34%; Bumiputera Sabah 20.2% and Bumiputera <lb/>Sarawak 7.3%) still a focus of poverty reduction efforts, with programmes providing food, financial <lb/>aid and skills training. Income inequality has gradually reduced from very high levels, with low-<lb/>income households and previously disadvantaged ethnic groups benefiting more than <lb/>proportionately. The income share of the top 20% of households compared to the B40 has declined <lb/>substantially over this period, at a faster rate than Malaysia&apos;s overall Gini coefficient for household <lb/>income (Figure 1). <lb/>Figure 1. Income inequality has declined <lb/>Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia. <lb/>Malaysia remains very unequal in terms of wealth distribution. Estimates suggest that 53% of Malaysian <lb/>households had zero financial assets in 2009, with ethnic Malay median financial wealth of just one ringgit <lb/>(Muhammed Abdul Khalid, 2014). These estimates also indicate that some 92% of household wealth was <lb/>concentrated in property, consistent with high rates of home ownership in Malaysia (76% of Malaysian <lb/>households owned their home in 2014). <lb/>As absolute poverty in Malaysia has been reduced to low levels, relative poverty provides a <lb/>more important benchmark for poverty eradication. The relative income poverty rate (based on an <lb/>unadjusted 50% of median income) has come down to 15.6% in 2014 from 17.4% in 2007, which is <lb/>above the OECD average but below the level in a comparable country such as Turkey (Figure 2.A). <lb/>Inequality is particularly stark along regional lines, with a near eightfold difference in income <lb/>inequality between the richest and poorest states (Figure 2.B and Figure 18 further down). Very small <lb/>(single-person) and large (six-person) households appear particularly vulnerable to relative poverty, with <lb/>education completion, urbanisation, broadband connectivity, and labour force participation <lb/>among the factors associated with regional differences in relative poverty (Nixon, 2016). <lb/>Multidimensional indicators of inequality, such as healthcare, education and information availability, also <lb/>display ample regional variation. <lb/>The differences across space and groups in recent cost of living pressures also suggest the need to <lb/>focus not only on the rural poor in less developed states but also on urban low-income households.

			<body>inflation was almost two percentage points lower in relatively wealthy Kuala Lumpur than in poorer Sabah <lb/>and Labuan, while inflation for households in the lowest income quintile was up to 0.6% higher (BNM, <lb/>2015). The absence of household income data for this period makes it difficult to determine if households <lb/>in areas of higher inflation have benefited from compensatory adjustments in income; however, differences <lb/>in local cost-of-living increases may be contributing to regional inequality. <lb/>Figure 2. Relative poverty indicators <lb/>Note: In Panel A, the data for Malaysia is based on relative poverty before taxes and transfers, with the rate after taxes and <lb/>transfers assumed to be the same, consistent with the minimal redistributive effects of the tax and transfer system (see Figure 9 <lb/>below). <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), OECD Income Distribution Database, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/data-00654-en; Department of <lb/>Statistics, Malaysia. <lb/>Broader measures of inclusive growth and well-being <lb/>The OECD Better Life Index provides an overall snapshot of living standards within a country as <lb/>a measure of the inclusiveness of growth. Malaysia scores well on some indicators, in particular <lb/>long-term unemployment (Figure 3). However, the index illustrates Malaysia&apos;s relative weakness in <lb/>areas such as educational attainment and skills, as well as personal earnings. Improving education quality <lb/>and skills training is essential to raise lifetime earning potential and social mobility while promoting social <lb/>cohesion and well-being over the longer term. The index also highlights the need to further improve <lb/>healthcare to increase healthy life expectancy. Maintaining universal access to quality medical services, <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>particularly in rural areas and for low-income urban residents, would help narrow the life-expectancy gap <lb/>with advanced countries. <lb/>Figure 3. Well-being indicators point to further opportunities to foster inclusive growth <lb/>1. Due to data availability, the indicators used in the OECD Better Life database are not necessarily identical with this exercise. <lb/>Therefore, the high and low-income OECD data does not always correspond to the data in the OECD Better Life database. <lb/>2. In panel A, indicators are normalised to range between 10 (best) and 0 (worst) according to the following formula: (indicator value <lb/>– minimum value) / (maximum value -minimum value) x 10. In panel B, a simple ranking of the OECD countries is applied. <lb/>3. OECD high/bottom income countries are countries belonging to the top/bottom 30% income of the OECD member countries. <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), Better Life Index (database), www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org; national sources; UNESCO, UIS. Stat database. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>10 <lb/>The World Economic Forum&apos;s Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2015 broadly confirms <lb/>the findings of the OECD Better Life Index (WEF, 2015). Malaysia performs strongly compared with <lb/>other middle-income countries for its income level in areas such as the provision of basic services (food, <lb/>drinking water and electricity), home ownership, financial inclusion, employment, corruption perceptions <lb/>and the quality and access to healthcare. However, the report identifies several areas of poor performance <lb/>relative to other middle-income countries, in particular education outcomes, healthcare costs, labour <lb/>force participation (especially women and elderly persons), pollution and social welfare. <lb/>Malaysia has created its own well-being index drawing on indicators specific to its circumstances <lb/>and priorities (Figure 4). The index captures aspects of inclusiveness similar to those embodied in the <lb/>OECD Better Life Index but uses different indicators to represent these, determined by data availability <lb/>rather than policy targets (see Annex 1 at the end of this paper). The index tracks improvements over time <lb/>rather than providing an internationally comparable frontier approach. It suggests that between 2000 and <lb/>2014, most improvement has occurred in areas such as housing, transport, leisure, education, income and <lb/>distribution; while improvement has been more modest in areas such as health, environment and <lb/>family. The decline in index values for 2013 reflects short-lived dips in areas such as housing, culture and <lb/>social participation, but also more significant downward trends in working life, environment and family <lb/>life – with index values for the latter two having almost reverted back to the 2000 baseline. <lb/>Divergence between the evolution of economic and social well-being and GDP growth over the <lb/>period reflects the incorporation of indicators that can be weakly or even negatively correlated with <lb/>GDP. Examples include environmental variables such as air quality and waste generation, family <lb/>variables including the dependency ratio, household debt, divorce rates and reported crime, and economic <lb/>well-being measures such as average working hours and education attainment rates. Also, the index lacks <lb/>a reference point against which outcomes can be assessed. Assessing the evolution of the index against <lb/>domestic goals (such as expected index growth based on policy targets) and international benchmarks <lb/>would be beneficial. Increased timeliness and frequency of index reporting would also support Malaysia&apos;s <lb/>efforts to foster inclusive growth. <lb/>Nonetheless, Malaysia&apos;s continued use of both domestic and international indicators of well-being will <lb/>help develop reforms supporting inclusive growth. Since its introduction in 2013, the index has been used <lb/>to identify areas in need of reform and develop new policies. Examples of initiatives prompted by the <lb/>introduction of the index include the Smart Partnership Towards Sustainable Environment programme to <lb/>raise environmental awareness, the 1Malaysia Family First Movement (1MFF) and Smartstart to reinforce <lb/>family values and provide guidance for young families, and the Belia Mahir 1Malaysia programme <lb/>providing vocational courses to young Malaysians. <lb/>A more inclusive labour market <lb/>Malaysia has a strong record of full employment that has benefited social well-being and <lb/>inclusiveness. However, so far labour market deficiencies have prevented low unemployment from <lb/>delivering the expected higher returns to work and skilled employment opportunities befitting a <lb/>high-income economy. <lb/>Employee safety nets that are standard in many high-income countries are underdeveloped in <lb/>Malaysia, which has a new but incompletely enforced minimum wage, no employment insurance scheme, <lb/>a lack of industry-based skills training, and a low unionisation rate. This exerts a drag on the promotion <lb/>of inclusive and productive labour markets, hindering industrial transformation from labour-intensive low-<lb/>skilled activities toward a more high-skilled, high-productivity economy. High-skilled job creation has not <lb/>kept pace with tertiary graduation rates, contributing to outflows of skilled labour abroad. Addressing the <lb/>low participation rates of women, youth and old people in particular would increase inclusiveness and <lb/>productivity. Labour market reforms would raise returns to work, increase participation rates, and <lb/>facilitate the transformation to high-skilled and high-productivity activities. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>11 <lb/>Figure 4. Malaysian Well-being Index growth relative to GDP <lb/>Source: EPU (2013), Malaysian Well-being Report 2013. <lb/>Active labour market policies can help harness the productive potential of the population and <lb/>contribute to economic growth, social cohesion and the sustainability of the social protection system. <lb/>To this end, the government needs to maintain the motivation of jobseekers to actively pursue <lb/>employment while also improving their employability and expanding their opportunities to be placed <lb/>and retained in appropriate jobs (OECD, 2015a). <lb/>Addressing labour market imbalances that limit employee returns <lb/>Returns to work remain comparatively low in Malaysia, as reflected in a much lower share of <lb/>employee compensation in GDP than in OECD countries (Figure 5.A). Slow growth of skilled job creation <lb/>is contributing to this (Figure 5.B). Low relative returns to labour limit the inclusiveness of labour <lb/>markets by discouraging participation and delivering excessive benefits to capital holders. <lb/>A minimum wage was introduced in 2013, applying to both Malaysian national and migrant <lb/>workers. In 2009, around 34% of private sector workers earned less than MYR 700 (USD 175) per month, <lb/>below the MYR 800 (USD 200) national poverty line income. The introduction of the minimum wage <lb/>was estimated to have increased the wages of roughly 3.2 million private sector workers, or approximately <lb/>30% of the total workforce, though a systematic assessment of beneficiaries has not been carried out <lb/>post implementation (UNDP, 2013; BNM 2013). The decline in relative poverty between 2012 and 2014 <lb/>may reflect a positive impact of the minimum wage (Figure 2.B). Rates are determined every two-<lb/>three years by a consultative council comprising government, employer association and union <lb/>representatives. As of 1 July 2016, the monthly rate was raised to MYR 1 000 (USD 250) for Peninsular <lb/>Malaysia and MYR 920 (USD 240) for the states of Sabah and Sarawak. The minimum for Peninsular <lb/>Malaysia stood at 57% of the median wage in 2014. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>12 <lb/>Figure 5. The wage share is relatively low and skilled job creation has lagged <lb/>1. Skilled employment includes managers, professionals, technicians and associated professionals. <lb/>2. Semi-skilled employment includes clerical support workers, service and sales workers, skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery <lb/>workers, craft and related trades workers, and plant and machine-operators and assemblers. <lb/>3. Low-skilled employment is for the remaining elementary occupations. <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), OECD National Accounts Statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/data-00001-en; national statistics <lb/>offices; EPU (2015a), &quot; Labour Market for an Advanced Nation &quot; , The Eleventh Malaysia Plan Strategy Paper No. 8; EPU <lb/>(2015b), Eleventh Malaysia Plan. <lb/>However, enforcement seems to be uneven and the number of minimum wage beneficiaries <lb/>may be overestimated, with legislative loopholes being exploited to convert existing benefits into wages <lb/>and weak enforcement for undocumented migrant workers (MOHR, 2016; ILO, 2016). <lb/>The 11th Malaysia Plan includes a commitment to establish a National Wage Index, to be compiled <lb/>under the aegis of the Ministry of Human Resources, to serve as a guide for employers in determining <lb/>wage levels for employees. Indicative wage levels will be based on employee qualifications, skills and <lb/>productivity. The index will not reduce the flexibility of employers to set wages on the basis of market <lb/>demand and supply, but is meant to increase recognition among employers of the need to regularly adjust <lb/>wages to reflect the increased skills and experience of their employees. Implementation of the index <lb/>will require agreement between the government and employer and employee representatives on <lb/>methodology (through the National Wages Consultative Council). <lb/>Reforms have also sought to reduce labour market skills mismatches through increased tertiary <lb/>sector cooperation with industry and the creation of TalentCorp. Established in 2011 as an agency <lb/>under the Prime Minister&apos;s Department, TalentCorp co-ordinates labour market and skills-development <lb/>policies under the Talent Roadmap 2020. Policies aim to facilitate demand-driven, inclusive and productive <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>13 <lb/>labour markets through reskilling programmes to reduce skills gaps, information and job-matching <lb/>services to reduce youth unemployment, initiatives to enhance female labour participation and the <lb/>attraction and retention of foreign talent, including Malaysians working abroad. Education sector reforms <lb/>to address supply-side constraints, such as the shortage of job-ready graduates, are necessary. <lb/>The introduction of an employment insurance scheme is also an ongoing reform priority and an <lb/>essential element of a well-functioning labour market. In OECD countries, such insurance schemes <lb/>encourage labour mobility and risk-taking, provide temporary income smoothing and facilitate job-<lb/>search and retraining to minimise time out of the workforce. They can also provide an incentive for <lb/>formalisation in countries where the informal sector remains significant. A proposed scheme is currently <lb/>being debated, with consensus among stakeholders yet to be reached (see below the section on <lb/>social protection). <lb/>The 11th Malaysia Plan incorporates planned revisions to labour legislation to address rigidities that <lb/>prevent more flexible working hours and make dismissal processes tedious and repetitive. This includes <lb/>allowing disputes on dismissals that cannot be resolved by conciliation to be referred automatically to <lb/>the industrial court for arbitration. The experience of OECD countries in the past decade demonstrates <lb/>the benefits of less rigid dismissal processes, which increase incentives to hire new workers and <lb/>enhance the overall flexibility of the labour market to appropriately reward productivity. Recent OECD <lb/>country experience also highlights the importance of accompanying reforms to provide adequate <lb/>employment insurance and effective re-employment services (OECD, 2013a). <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s low trade union membership rate at 9.4% in 2013 compared with an average of 17% for <lb/>OECD countries (ILO data) is also indicative of labour market imbalances that limit returns for workers. <lb/>Impediments to the formation of unions and their rights to influence remuneration and conditions <lb/>contribute to this, though implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPPA) is expected to <lb/>require major improvements in this area. Indeed, TPPA signatories are required to ensure compliance with <lb/>the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-Up. The <lb/>principles and rights include the freedom of association in forming labour unions and collective <lb/>bargaining, and the elimination of employment discrimination. Alongside these expected changes, a modest <lb/>Trade Union Development Programme has been introduced to increase worker understanding of collective <lb/>bargaining and encourage union creation. These reforms will improve the balance between the <lb/>protection of employees and the promotion of a flexible labour market. <lb/>Raising labour participation rates of women, youth and older people <lb/>Another priority for creating a more inclusive labour market is to raise the labour participation <lb/>rates of women, youth and older people – groups which have ample room to contribute toward raising the <lb/>overall participation rate. Across OECD countries, the gender employment gap has narrowed, with increased <lb/>labour participation of women the result of rising education attainment and increased use of family-friendly <lb/>policies (OECD, 2015b). In Malaysia, participation rates for these groups remain relatively low compared <lb/>to other Southeast and East Asian countries and the OECD average (Figure 6.A and B). <lb/>The labour participation rate of women decreases with age from 25-29 years old in Malaysia, <lb/>displaying a single-peak curve. This contrasts with the M-shaped participation profile of countries such as <lb/>Japan and Korea, where participation rates rise anew after falling at the time of childbirth (Figure 6.C). <lb/>Prior to 2010, female labour participation rates remained stubbornly low at around 46%. Reforms since <lb/>then have contributed to it increasing to 54% in 2015, with the 11th Malaysia Plan targeting 59% <lb/>by 2020. The government is encouraging female labour participation by providing better labour market <lb/>information, improving access to jobs through the 1Malaysia Support for Housewives and Flexworklife <lb/>programmes, and supporting entrepreneurship among women through Women Entrepreneurial <lb/>Incubator (Azam Niaga) and 1Nita programmes. Women&apos;s participation also benefits from the <lb/>Figure 6 Labour participation rates are relatively low <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>14 <lb/>Note: In panel B, data for Malaysia is 2015 and 2014 for all others. <lb/>Source: ILO, ILOStat database; OECD, Labour force statistics database, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/lfs-lfs-data-en. <lb/>Career Comeback programme and Resourcing and Retention grants (which provide financial <lb/>incentives for employers to hire returning workers) and the flexWorkLife.my portal increasing <lb/>awareness of flexible working arrangements. To achieve the 59% target rate, the government will be <lb/>strengthening its family-friendly employment strategy, including better access and affordability to quality <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>15 <lb/>childcare facilities and early childhood education. It will also be undertaking labour market reforms <lb/>promoting flexible working conditions, including flexible working hours and work-from-home options. <lb/>Such family-friendly strategies and labour market reforms have proven to be effective in OECD <lb/>countries. Providing life-long learning and reskilling opportunities would also facilitate women&apos;s return <lb/>to work. Malaysia&apos;s particular challenge is to raise the participation rate of middle-aged and older <lb/>women. Women of these generations have lower average levels of educational attainment, thus <lb/>programmes that provide re-skilling opportunities and hiring incentives for employers are necessary to <lb/>facilitate their re-entry. <lb/>Although the overall unemployment rate is low, at around 3% in recent years, unemployment <lb/>of youth aged 15-24 approached 11% in 2015, accounting for 61% of total unemployment. The share of <lb/>unemployed persons with tertiary degrees has risen steadily to close to 34% in 2015 (Figure 7.A). <lb/>Unemployed women with a tertiary degree have become one of the largest groups of unemployed (Figure <lb/>7.B). <lb/>Figure 7. Youth unemployment <lb/>Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia. <lb/>Higher unemployment rates among the highly-educated youth can largely be attributed to skill <lb/>mismatches and a lack of work experience. To achieve the 11th Malaysia Plan target for youth <lb/>unemployment of below 8% by 2020, the successful implementation of reforms to improve skills training, <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>16 <lb/>job matching and the industry relevance of tertiary qualifications will be critical. The government also <lb/>offers a programme, Transit home, aimed at high-risk children and youth to improve their <lb/>employability including entrepreneurship, education and skills training as well as providing emotional <lb/>and psychological support to return into society. <lb/>Stronger minimum wage enforcement and effective policies for migrant workers <lb/>While the introduction of a minimum wage in 2013 has lifted wages for numerous low-paid workers, <lb/>many workers are not benefiting from increased legal protections. The informal sector (defined as firms <lb/>which are not registered with the authorities) accounted for 1.4 million workers or 11.5% of employment <lb/>in the non-agricultural sector in 2015, according to the Informal Sector Workforce Survey Report (DOS, <lb/>2016). <lb/>Strengthening the enforcement of the minimum wage is essential to its ongoing effectiveness. As <lb/>regards employers, the promotion of business registration associated with the introduction of the Goods <lb/>and Services Tax (GST) in 2015 has encouraged the formalisation of firms that previously operated <lb/>in the shadow economy. Further formalisation can be promoted through outreach programmes to <lb/>raise awareness and regulatory reform to reduce the costs of business registration and licencing. <lb/>Complementary initiatives to increase spot checks and auditing of compliance with minimum wages <lb/>and other labour-related regulations would also assist. Stronger penalties for non-compliance may act as a <lb/>deterrent (the maximum penalty per worker is equivalent to less than one year of minimum wages). <lb/>Enforcement could also be strengthened through incentives and opportunities for workers to assist <lb/>government compliance activity. In the absence of a strong union presence in Malaysia, awareness of <lb/>and access to complaints procedures or government tip lines is not widespread among low-skilled, low-<lb/>income workers. Government regulators need to be proactive in raising awareness and engaging with <lb/>workers who otherwise may struggle to find them, in particular foreign workers, whose livelihood is <lb/>under the comprehensive power of their employer by virtue of Malaysia&apos;s employer-responsibility <lb/>system for the recruitment and care of foreign workers (although legal foreign workers are less likely to <lb/>experience mistreatment). <lb/>More broadly Malaysia needs to rectify its approach to labour migration policies that for two <lb/>decades have focussed on immediate business needs rather than longer-term settlement. While business-<lb/>oriented temporary worker programmes provide flexibility as part of an overall immigration policy mix, <lb/>the sole focus on temporary workers should be revisited to reduce the business stranglehold on low-<lb/>skilled labour policy. This would encourage migrants to cooperate with government as legal <lb/>temporary workers and potential future permanent residents where consistent with long-term labour <lb/>market needs (ILO, 2016) (Box 1). <lb/>Strengthening social protection <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s success in alleviating poverty, a major target under the 1971 New Economic Policy, has been <lb/>achieved despite the absence of an integrated and comprehensive social protection system. Households <lb/>benefit from near-universal access to electricity, clean water, healthcare and transport, but income <lb/>support for disadvantaged persons (such as the unemployed, single parents, disabled and elderly) <lb/>remains ad hoc, insufficiently targeted and inadequate in providing basic living standards. Achieving <lb/>inclusive growth not only requires providing meaningful employment but protecting people who are unable <lb/>to work. For Malaysia to achieve its aspiration of becoming a high-income country, a key priority is to <lb/>develop a comprehensive social protection system that provides targeted and timely support to those in <lb/>need, while retaining strong incentives and facilitation mechanisms to maximise labour market <lb/>participation. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. An immigration policy befitting a high-income inclusive country <lb/>The 11th Malaysia Plan includes a commitment to develop a comprehensive immigration and <lb/>employment policy for foreign workers – a reform that is essential for Malaysia to become a high-income and <lb/>inclusive society. Effective implementation of Malaysia&apos;s TPPA commitments and minimum wage laws also depends <lb/>on improving the rights of foreign workers. Promoting high value-added industries and Malaysia as an education <lb/>hub requires policies to attract and retain talented people, which are linked to broader immigration policies. <lb/>Like other middle-income economies, Malaysia seeks to attract or retain highly educated and skilled labour but <lb/>mainly attracts low-skilled immigrants and sees many educated Malaysians emigrate. Policies towards low-skilled <lb/>immigration are becoming increasingly restrictive as perceptions increase that it puts Malaysian workers at a <lb/>disadvantage, despite evidence to the contrary (World Bank, 2015). The 11th Malaysia plan introduced the first-ever <lb/>cap on all foreign migrant workers at 15% of the total workforce by 2020. At the same time, a specialised agency <lb/>(TalentCorp) is tasked to attract skilled workers from overseas, utilising process streamlining and tax incentives to <lb/>lure expatriate Malaysians back home. Yet high and low skilled labour cannot be completely divorced from each other, <lb/>with the overall immigration environment a potential influence on skilled labour and business decision-making. <lb/>To attract high-skilled labour, TalentCorp helps match skilled migrants to employment opportunities, cuts <lb/>through red tape and provides one-stop services for skilled migrants living and working in Malaysia. Eligible skilled <lb/>migrants are provided with a range of benefits that provide stability and certainty, including a ten-year pass to live and work <lb/>in the country, flexibility to move from one employer to another, eligibility for their spouse to work, and a clearer path to <lb/>permanent residency for themselves and family members. Tax incentives are also provided but are likely to be little more <lb/>than sweeteners relative to these incentives. Immigration of high-skilled workers is low volume, uncontroversial and for <lb/>some industries benefits from mutual recognition of planned qualifications within ASEAN. <lb/>In contrast, policies regarding low-skilled foreign workers are high volume and politically charged, resulting in <lb/>migration being more difficult to manage. Registered foreign workers accounted for 17% of total employment in 2014, <lb/>while the share is estimated to be 27% if undocumented foreign workers are taken into account. Indeed, 2.5 million <lb/>unregistered foreign workers applied for regularisation in 2011 (OECD, 2012a). A large portion of registered foreign <lb/>workers were engaged on a short-term basis in the manufacturing (36%), agriculture (23%) and construction (20%) <lb/>sectors, reflecting restrictions on employment in many services sectors. Approximately one-third of the agricultural, <lb/>manufacturing and construction workforce are migrants (ILO, 2016). Official planning documents, domestic <lb/>commentators and to some extent industry see an enduring reliance on informal low-cost and low-skilled foreign <lb/>workers as contributing to slower than desirable industrial upgrading and lower wage growth, though a causal link is <lb/>difficult to substantiate. As noted previously, policies to align domestic and foreign worker rights through minimum wages <lb/>and conditions are welcome but incompletely implemented and enforced (ILO, 2016). In addition to the 15% quota on migrant <lb/>workers, increasingly high levies on migrant workers have further sought to reduce incentives to hire these workers and <lb/>provide a financial barrier to prospective employers of migrants. The government attempted to drastically increase levies in <lb/>early 2016, but has reduced the size of the hike following protests from employers. Malaysia has also bolstered regulations <lb/>covering the employment and conditions of foreign workers, although the minimum wage does not apply to domestic <lb/>helpers, who are mostly foreign workers. It has set up a single-window system for employers to apply for worker permits <lb/>to encourage formalisation and has strengthened laws against the employers of undocumented foreign workers. However, <lb/>these measures do not appear to have been effective in managing migration patterns or community attitudes to foreign <lb/>workers. <lb/>The limited effectiveness of existing measures is not surprising, as they fall short of a considered approach to <lb/>immigration policy underpinned by well-aligned incentives and penalties. Frequent policy changes provide little <lb/>certainty for prospective migrants or businesses and only serve to exacerbate challenges in facilitating cooperation <lb/>from either stakeholder. The absence of a clear path to permanent migration for low-skilled workers and a <lb/>compliance system overly dependent on business disempowers government and migrants and provides <lb/>opportunities for business exploitation. Further government commitments to introduce a strict liability concept, <lb/>whereby employers of foreign workers are fully responsible for migrant recruitment and welfare, may further <lb/>exacerbate these concerns and consolidate business dominance over immigration policy. Ineffective <lb/>management of community attitudes to immigration is also not endearing the cooperation of migrant and business <lb/>stakeholders. Malaysia should urgently fulfil its commitment to develop a comprehensive immigration and <lb/>employment policy for migrant workers to provide stability, certainty and coherence to immigration policy. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>Malaysia&apos;s social protection expenditure is low for its development stage <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s social protection expenditure is lower than in all Southeast Asian countries for which data <lb/>are available and than in all but a handful of countries in the Asia-Pacific region (ADB, 2015). Public <lb/>expenditure on social protection as a proportion of GDP typically rises in step with GDP per capita, as has <lb/>been the case for OECD countries. This has not been the case in Malaysia (Figure 8). <lb/>The low level of social protection expenditure is further reflected in the low redistributive <lb/>power of the tax-and-transfer system: pre and post-tax and transfer Gini coefficients for income barely <lb/>differ, like in Turkey (OECD, 2012b; Figure 9). <lb/>Subsidies that artificially kept down fuel, food and transport prices were by far the largest transfer <lb/>to households prior to their substantial removal in 2014 (amounting to around MYR 24 billion or 4% of <lb/>nominal GDP in 2013). Pension payments to retired civil servants are now the largest transfer, benefiting <lb/>a small set of comparatively well-off households. Neither of these are a transfer that targets social <lb/>welfare to low-income households. <lb/>Figure 8. Social expenditure in Malaysia has not increased in step with GDP per capita <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), Social spending (indicator), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/7497563b-en; ADB, Statistical Database <lb/>System. <lb/>A key priority is the introduction of an employment insurance scheme that integrates job-matching <lb/>services, reskilling and income smoothing to prevent a temporary setback from becoming an entrenched <lb/>disadvantage. The government has proposed an employer-and-employee-funded Employment Insurance <lb/>System based on the set-up in Japan and Korea, but the proposed funding model is opposed by the social <lb/>partners, pointing to the merits of considering financing it through general tax revenue, as in Australia. The <lb/>overall experience of OECD countries suggests that in practice, employer, employee and <lb/>government co-financing is often required. The proposed scheme would provide the unemployed with <lb/>allowances for job placement and retraining and early re-employment incentives. While suitable for <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s immediate need to improve support for the temporarily unemployed, a more <lb/>comprehensive scheme that also includes temporary income smoothing payments would further reduce <lb/>financial barriers to re-employment and overall income inequality. It would also encourage increased <lb/>productivity by providing a safety net for entrepreneurial risk-taking and labour mobility. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>19 <lb/>Figure 9. Malaysia&apos;s tax-and-transfer system has little effect on income distribution <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), Social spending (indicator), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/7497563b-en; ADB, Statistical Database System. <lb/>Fragmentation of programmes and institutions results in poorly targeted support <lb/>Social expenditure is highly fragmented, being provided through a multitude of small-scale, specific-<lb/>purpose programmes by a diverse range of ministries. The Ministry of Women, Family and <lb/>Community Development is the lead agency for social support programmes targeting extreme poverty <lb/>and workforce participation support for disabled persons and women. Social support for farmers, <lb/>subsidised diesel for fishermen and rice rations for poor families are provided by the Ministry of <lb/>Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, support programmes and incentives for poor students by the <lb/>Ministry of Education, medical support through the Ministry of Health and so on. The introduction of cash <lb/>payments for families under the BR1M (1Malaysia People&apos;s Aid) programme has added the Ministry of <lb/>Finance as an additional direct stakeholder in social expenditure. At the same time, the &quot; eKasih &quot; database <lb/>developed to improve the registration and targeting of social welfare recipients is maintained within the <lb/>Implementation Coordination Unit under the Prime Minister&apos;s Department. The implementation of the <lb/>proposed employment insurance scheme would add the Ministry of Human Resources to an <lb/>increasingly disjointed social protection system that is prohibitively difficult for potential recipients to <lb/>navigate. <lb/>Key pillars among the range of social support programmes are 1AZAM, the eKasih database and <lb/>BR1M. 1AZAM is a flagship programme focused on providing income-generating opportunities for <lb/>low-income households, reducing their reliance on government support. It typifies Malaysia&apos;s <lb/>employment-oriented approach to social welfare (which includes providing higher income support to <lb/>employed than unemployed disabled persons) and represents a successful example of inter-agency <lb/>collaboration to tackle pockets of poverty (particularly in rural areas). The eKasih database is a critical <lb/>enabler of social protection targeting, supporting the identification of impoverished households and <lb/>connecting them with assistance programmes. Continued efforts to improve the database will support <lb/>the effectiveness of social protection policy-making and programme implementation. Since 2012, the <lb/>BR1M programme has provided cash payments to lower-income households to ease cost-of-living <lb/>pressures. While increasing each year, the BR1M programme allocation of MYR 5.9 billion in 2016 is far <lb/>smaller, though better targeted, than the value of the discontinued fuel and food subsidies. Into its fifth <lb/>year, the BR1M programme remains ad hoc and irregular in its payment arrangements, providing little <lb/>financial certainty for low-income households while jarring with the employment emphasis of other <lb/>programmes. A more considered approach to BR1M and social protection programmes more broadly is <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>20 <lb/>needed to improve the consistency of objectives, programme targeting and the overall impact on reducing <lb/>disadvantage. <lb/>Beyond government, civil society makes an important contribution to social expenditure in <lb/>Malaysia. As the size of this contribution increases, the effectiveness of Islamic institutions supporting <lb/>the collection and distribution of Zakat and collaboration with government will be critical to optimising <lb/>overall social expenditure (Box 2). <lb/>Towards a comprehensive social safety net <lb/>It is essential that Malaysia develop a comprehensive social protection and income transfer system <lb/>that provides targeted and timely support to those in need, while retaining strong incentives and facilitation <lb/>mechanisms to maximise labour market participation. This requires more than filling gaps with new and <lb/>often contradictory programmes, and calls for undertaking a comprehensive assessment of social protection <lb/>needs and optimal strategies to meet them. <lb/>Experience suggests there is no one-size-fits-all approach to social protection systems, which <lb/>need to be suited to country circumstances. However, a well-designed system would complement the <lb/>strong incentives to engage in productive employment that exist in Malaysia, while supporting <lb/>inclusiveness through income redistribution and employment facilitation mechanisms for low-income <lb/>households, unemployed, sick, disabled and elderly persons. <lb/>Box 2. The contribution of Zakat to social expenditure in Malaysia <lb/>One of the five fundamental obligations of Islam is that Muslims contribute a proportion of their income and wealth <lb/>to a compulsory charitable mechanism called Zakat, with funds redistributed to households as supplementary income <lb/>to alleviate poverty. Every Malaysian state has its own institution responsible for collecting Zakat and making <lb/>redistributions in accordance with its own Zakat poverty line, which is determined on a similar income basis to <lb/>government poverty lines. <lb/>The contribution of Zakat to social expenditure has increased significantly in recent years, in absolute terms <lb/>and in proportion to GDP (Figure 10). Importantly from the perspective of expenditure consistency and timeliness, the <lb/>growth in Zakat collections is not proportional to GDP but holds up well during times of economic turbulence, when it <lb/>is most needed. In 2013, Zakat represented over 20% of the level of government social spending excluding <lb/>health, making it a major contributor to Malaysia&apos;s overall social expenditure. <lb/>Figure 10. Zakat has been expanding rapidly <lb/>Note: Social expenditure in Panel B includes central government expenditure on social security and welfare and zakat expenditure. <lb/>Source: Department of Awqaf, Zakat and Hajj (JAWHAR); ADB (2016), Statistical Database System. <lb/>Recent growth in the size of collections has prompted additional research evaluating the effectiveness of Zakat as <lb/>a social expenditure mechanism (Johari et al., 2015). While effective in alleviating poverty by supplementing the <lb/>income of benefiting households by as much as 30%, studies have identified numerous ways to increase Zakat <lb/>collections, distributional targeting and the professionalism of institutional governance. Among priority areas for <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>21 <lb/>improvement are delays in the distribution of funds, the need for modern collection methodologies (such as internet <lb/>banking) and disbursement for income-generation activities (rather than income supplements). <lb/>Greater collaboration between state-level Zakat centres, state and federal governments could further assist in <lb/>reducing duplication and the effective targeting of assistance to impoverished households. Localised Zakat <lb/>administration can help identify and address local needs but lacks the redistributive capacity of national <lb/>administration. Indeed, Zakat collections and therefore redistributions are significantly higher in wealthier states, <lb/>limiting the ability to target pockets of poverty in poorer states. The development of a national social <lb/>protection system should maximise complementarities between government expenditure and the increasingly <lb/>significant role of Zakat. <lb/>Setting up such a system will require an initial scoping study to map existing programmes and <lb/>comprehensively identify the vulnerable in need of social protection, including an analysis of the <lb/>determinants of vulnerability and the needs of affected persons. The end goal is a single strategy <lb/>with implementation supported by clear institutional responsibilities and capacity, including in relation <lb/>to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of system performance. Malaysia could utilise global best <lb/>practice toolkits such as the Inter Agency Social Protection Assessments toolkit (ISPA, 2016) and draw <lb/>lessons from the OECD Development Centre&apos;s work to develop social protection systems in the region <lb/>(OECD, 2016). ISPA provides a framework for countries to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the <lb/>overall social protection system, including policies, programmes and administration. It provides a platform <lb/>for collaboration between government agencies to develop a common vision for social protection systems <lb/>and ensure a consistent, inter-agency approach to system development, implementation and evaluation. <lb/>A comprehensive social protection system would complement the implementation of other policy <lb/>priorities identified in this paper. For example, income smoothing for unemployed persons would be <lb/>conducive to formalisation of the labour force, allowing for improved targeting of employment facilitation <lb/>and retraining programmes, a broader income tax base, and increased innovation and entrepreneurship by <lb/>lowering the potential cost of risk-taking. <lb/>A tax and transfer system that supports inclusive growth <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s tax and transfer system can do more for inclusive growth, with overall tax collection and <lb/>redistribution both low by OECD and global standards. As Malaysia approaches high-income <lb/>country status and as its society ages, higher tax revenue will be needed to fund growing fiscal expenditure. <lb/>Low global oil prices together with an increasingly services sector and domestic demand driven <lb/>economy have prompted a prudent rebalancing of Malaysia&apos;s revenue base, but further reforms are needed to <lb/>improve medium-term fiscal sustainability. Reforms are needed to increase the overall tax base, improve the <lb/>balance of its composition and provide additional resources for programmes promoting inclusive growth. <lb/>The complexity of the interactions between the recent and the possible additional reforms points to the need <lb/>for an overall review of the tax base as part of a broader review of medium-term fiscal sustainability. <lb/>Reversing the decline in revenue collection <lb/>Low global oil prices have seen oil-related revenue decline substantially in recent years, with its <lb/>share in overall revenue estimated to have halved between 2014 and 2016, to under 15%. Declining oil-<lb/>related revenue is the latest contribution to a more concerning longer-term structural decline in the overall <lb/>tax base. From around 20% of GDP prior to the Asian Financial Crisis, tax revenue has fallen throughout <lb/>the 2000s to around 15% of GDP today (Figure 11). Tax revenue as a share of GDP is less than half the <lb/>34% OECD average and trending downwards. This evolution contrasts with the experience of other <lb/>countries with rising income levels. <lb/>Faced with declining oil-related revenue, Malaysia has mainly acted on the spending side to achieve <lb/>fiscal consolidation. Nonetheless, some difficult tax reforms have been implemented to reduce the rate of <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>22 <lb/>revenue decline, including the introduction of the GST in April 2015 as well as an increase in the top <lb/>marginal income tax rate from 25% to 28%. Intensifying popular concerns with rising cost-of-living <lb/>pressures have more recently reversed the momentum for tax reform, prompting an expansion of the number <lb/>of exempt or zero-rated GST items and a series of new income and corporate tax deductions. <lb/>Additional revenue is necessary to support medium-term fiscal sustainability and make room for <lb/>increased spending on social protection, healthcare, infrastructure and communications technology in <lb/>rural areas and green growth. Malaysia&apos;s recently adopted medium-term fiscal framework will need to <lb/>incorporate a sustainable revenue trajectory that appropriately funds reform priorities. <lb/>Figure 11. The share of tax revenue in GDP is low and declining <lb/>Source: OECD (2015a), Revenue Statistics in Asian Countries 2015: Trends in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, <lb/>http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/ 9789264234277-en (for the years 1990-2013); MOF (2015), Economic Report 2015-2016 (for the <lb/>years 2014-16). <lb/>Indirect taxes and the GST in perspective <lb/>Indirect tax collections have declined over the past 25 years, with the revenue increase from the <lb/>recently-introduced GST providing only a partial offset. Sales tax revenue as a proportion of GDP is less <lb/>than half the early 1990s levels (Figure 11). Malaysia&apos;s opening to trade through the gradual reduction of <lb/>tariffs and duties provide a partial explanation. However, despite an increasing share of consumption <lb/>in GDP since the late 1990s, a combination of reduced tax rates and rising tax evasion has caused an <lb/>erosion of the indirect tax intake. Reversing this trend in the context of rising cost-of-living pressures will <lb/>be difficult but necessary. <lb/>Consumption taxes are potentially quite important to the overall tax mix given the size of the <lb/>informal household sector, which includes an estimated 1.7 million undocumented foreign <lb/>workers, and to tax around 350 000 Malaysian residents commuting to work in Singapore. <lb/>Implementation of the GST has been more successful than anticipated, with a high rate of business <lb/>compliance boosting collections beyond original projections. Recent research on OECD countries also <lb/>indicates that greater use of simple, broad-based consumption taxes can be beneficial in reducing <lb/>compliance costs and distortions to consumption decisions arising from differential rate systems, while also <lb/>being proportional or slightly progressive when measured as a percentage of household expenditure <lb/>(OECD/Korea Institute of Public Finance, 2014). In fact, there is ample scope for the GST to raise further <lb/>revenue. The initial rate of 6% is low by regional and broader international standards (Figure 12), while <lb/>increasingly extensive exemptions have reduced its effectiveness. For some zero-rated goods, the <lb/>introduction of the GST has actually resulted in a decline in the tax rate with the concurrent repeal <lb/>of the preceding sales tax. There is ample room for a gradual series of increases to bring Malaysia&apos;s GST <lb/>rate into line with regional peers and OECD countries. Reducing the number of exempt or zero-rated <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>23 <lb/>items and strengthening tax enforcement would help reduce tax leakage in the short term, while <lb/>consideration could be given to a gradual increase in the rate of the GST over the medium term. <lb/>Figure 12. The GST rate is low by international standards <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), Tax database, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/tax-data-en; KPMG (2015), 2015 Asia Pacific Indirect Tax Guide. <lb/>A more progressive income tax system with a broader base <lb/>Malaysia has traditionally sourced a large proportion of tax revenue from corporate income and <lb/>profits taxes, in particular through taxes on profitable state-owned oil companies (Figure 11). <lb/>Declining oil revenue in recent years has rendered this model unsustainable and highlighted the need to <lb/>diversify the tax base. Opportunities still exist to adjust corporate tax settings where these would <lb/>support broader industrial and environmental objectives. <lb/>Besides, Malaysia&apos;s income tax and transfer system does very little to enhance inclusiveness <lb/>through tax schedule progressivity or redistribution, as evidenced by almost identical before and after tax <lb/>and transfer Gini coefficients (Figure 9). A more progressive income tax schedule would complement the <lb/>development of a comprehensive social protection system in reducing income inequality. <lb/>Middle-income earners need to become taxpayers, with less than 10% of Malaysians over 15 years <lb/>old actually paying income tax. That personal income tax is only levied at a very high income threshold <lb/>compared to the average wage and the size of the informal sector are both part of the explanation. A <lb/>combination of higher tax rates and narrower tax bands throughout the schedule would raise the average <lb/>tax levied on middle and high-income earners, while exemptions or transfers could be used to protect <lb/>low-income households. <lb/>The top marginal tax rate for very-high-income earners was recently raised to 28% but remains well <lb/>below top rates of between 45% and 55% in higher-income OECD countries (OECD Tax Database). <lb/>Combined with significant tax incentives for high-income returning expatriates – who may be eligible for a <lb/>flat 15% income tax rate for five years -income taxes levy too small a contribution from Malaysia&apos;s richest. <lb/>Raising the highest marginal tax rate further could contribute to raising average taxes on high-income <lb/>earners, while the generosity and effectiveness of tax incentives offered to encourage expatriates to <lb/>return should be reviewed in terms of costs and benefits. <lb/>Taxes on capital income as well as on capital gains, in particular in relation to property, contribute <lb/>little to the current tax base. The high proportion of home ownership, while in some ways supportive of <lb/>inclusive growth, suggests incentives to invest (including low tax rates) are skewing household investment <lb/>towards property. Even minor increases in taxes on capital income and gains from property could raise <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>24 <lb/>significant revenue given the size of the potential base, while at the same time improving the progressivity <lb/>of the tax system. Property taxes are also underutilised, with ongoing taxes based on the value of the <lb/>property another possible means to achieve similar objectives. Additionally, with constitutional <lb/>responsibility for property taxes with state governments, reform in this area could support fiscal <lb/>decentralisation. <lb/>Malaysia also does not levy inheritance, estate or gift taxes. There is a clear case on distributional <lb/>grounds for taxing wealth transfers on death as a means of reducing long-run inequality, both by reducing <lb/>and dispersing wealth holdings and increasing equality of opportunity. Despite their merits, inheritance <lb/>taxes are underutilised globally, with low rates and numerous exemptions typical where they exist. <lb/>France and Belgium provide examples of successful systems, and yield fiscal revenue of around 0.5% of <lb/>GDP (Brys et al., 2016). Inheritance taxes can be designed as a tax on the donor&apos;s estate or on the recipients, <lb/>with inheritance taxes on the recipient the most consistent with inclusive growth. Differentiated <lb/>rates could be applied depending on the relation between the donor and the recipient, with a minimum <lb/>amount of the inherited wealth typically exempt from tax. An accompanying gift tax is often utilised to <lb/>minimise avoidance of the inheritance tax through pre-death transfers, with appropriate exemptions <lb/>to prevent non-avoidance related gifts from bearing a tax burden (for example, for gifts made more than <lb/>five years before death). Introducing taxes on the transfer of wealth under these circumstances would <lb/>not only reinforce the tax base but promote tax progressivity and reduce wealth inequality (Brys et al., <lb/>2016). <lb/>Malaysia is also working to address issues of international tax avoidance. Malaysia is participating in <lb/>regional network discussions under the OECD base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project, with the <lb/>Malaysian Inland Revenue Board currently undertaking a review of tax legislation in light of the BEPS <lb/>project. A BEPS Action Committee has been established, with Malaysia prepared to revise tax <lb/>legislation in accordance with international standards to the extent such standards are applicable and <lb/>relevant to the Malaysian context. <lb/>A more sustainable pension system that delivers higher retirement incomes <lb/>Malaysia has a longstanding dual-track pension system consisting of a non-contributory <lb/>defined benefit scheme for public sector workers (the Malaysian Public Sector Pension Scheme) and a <lb/>defined contribution system for the private sector (the Employees Provident Fund scheme). The public <lb/>scheme is funded from consolidated tax revenue, while the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is the <lb/>publicly-owned monopoly superannuation fund responsible for managing the contributions of private <lb/>sector and non-pensionable public sector employees (such as persons hired on a contractual basis). The <lb/>EPF is one of the world&apos;s largest pension funds with MYR 667 billion (approximately USD 171 billion or <lb/>58% of GDP in 2015) in assets under management as of mid-2015 (EPF, 2016). <lb/>A particular challenge for inclusive growth in transitioning towards high-income country status <lb/>is balancing growth in consumption and investment today while provisioning for sustainable living <lb/>standards in the future. The rapidly ageing population is already beginning to test the effectiveness of <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s pension system: the burden of financing generous public sector pensions is increasingly <lb/>unsustainable and replacement rates for private sector retirees who otherwise receive little systematic <lb/>support through other social protection programmes are inadequate. Reforms to strengthen the fiscal <lb/>sustainability of the public scheme and increase the adequacy of retirement living standards under <lb/>the private scheme are increasingly necessary. <lb/>A more sustainable approach for public service pensions <lb/>Like a number of OECD countries, Malaysia has an increasingly unsustainable public sector pension <lb/>system that offers more generous retirement incomes than afforded to private sector workers. Workers <lb/>retiring after 30 or more years of service receive a guaranteed ongoing pension equal to 60% of their <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>25 <lb/>final salary (excluding allowances), a lump-sum worth more than two years&apos; salary and free or subsidised <lb/>medical benefits for life. This implies a more-than-adequate effective replacement rate of around 80% of <lb/>final salary. Pensions are financed through general tax revenue – including the anticipated contribution <lb/>of Retirement Fund Incorporated established in 2007 to invest a portion of government funds set aside <lb/>for pensions – and employees do not explicitly contribute a portion of their salary to fund the scheme. <lb/>With pension expenditure having tripled in the past ten years to reach MYR 18 billion in 2015 (1.6% <lb/>of GDP) and a long way from peaking due to the burgeoning civil service headcount (up to 1.6 million <lb/>in 2015 from 0.98 million in 2000), a more sustainable system is urgently needed. Moving new employees <lb/>into a defined contribution scheme would help limit future pension liabilities to existing and former <lb/>employees, with legacy benefits paid out of a fully-financed separate fund. For equity reasons, it would be <lb/>desirable to transfer the new employees into the existing defined contribution scheme for private <lb/>sector employees. A transparent transition period with a one-off wage increase would help maintain <lb/>the attractiveness of the public sector, compensating for the effective reduction in overall benefits. This in <lb/>turn necessitates creating a dual-track system for all existing employees; that is, maintaining existing <lb/>pension benefits based on salary net of contributions, while creating a defined contribution account, <lb/>the balance of which would be deducted from the lump-sum calculation under existing pension rules. <lb/>While the one-off wage increase would not affect disposable income and therefore would not be expected to <lb/>have a significant impact on consumption, the transition would involve an increase in upfront government <lb/>expenditure on pensions (through the commencement of explicit contributions) that should be assessed <lb/>against the expected gains from reducing future liabilities. Reforms for public employees should also be <lb/>complemented by concurrent reforms to increase the robustness of the defined contribution system <lb/>(discussed below). <lb/>Raising the effective retirement age to account for rapid population ageing <lb/>Pension system sustainability requires careful long-term planning in anticipation of expected <lb/>demographic trends. While Malaysia&apos;s population structure is relatively young at present, it can expect to <lb/>experience rapid ageing, with a projected doubling from 7% to 14% of the proportion of the population <lb/>aged over 65 in just 20 years (World Bank, 2016) – by comparison it took the United Kingdom and the <lb/>United States 45 and 69 years respectively. On current trends, Malaysia could expect to reach aged nation <lb/>status (where the share of the population over 60 years old exceeds 15%) around 2030-35, with the next <lb/>15-20 years critical to developing a sustainable pension and broader social protection system for <lb/>elderly persons. <lb/>As life expectancy continues to increase and an increasing proportion of the population spend <lb/>more time in higher education before entering the workforce, all else remaining equal, a decreasing <lb/>number of working years would be expected to fund a longer retirement. Malaysia will face something <lb/>similar to the experience of high-income OECD countries, where system sustainability and the adequacy <lb/>of replacement rates will come under substantial strain in the absence of forward planning. <lb/>Malaysians can already expect a long retirement compared to residents of both OECD countries and <lb/>countries in the region (Figure 13). Despite being raised by five years in 2013, Malaysia&apos;s official <lb/>retirement age of 60 remains below the OECD average of 64 in 2014. Moreover, by not simultaneously <lb/>adjusting upward the withdrawal age for private sector workers under the EPF, the effective retirement <lb/>age remains at 55. Malaysia should consider an immediate alignment of the EPF withdrawal age with the <lb/>retirement age with transitional arrangements for current or imminent retirees, while developing a broader <lb/>strategy to progressively raise its official retirement age and the EPF withdrawal age in line with expected <lb/>changes in healthy life expectancy. Consultation between the EPF and its members on withdrawal age <lb/>increases indicates that changes will need be done cautiously and effectively communicated, as individual <lb/>awareness of retirement adequacy is low. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>26 <lb/>Figure 13. Malaysians can expect a lengthy retirement <lb/>Note: The data for OECD countries and China is for 2014, 2012 for all other countries. <lb/>Source: OECD (2013b), Pensions at a Glance Asia-Pacific 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_asia-2013-en; OECD <lb/>(2015c), Pensions at a Glance 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_glance-2015-en. <lb/>Options to improve replacement rates <lb/>The net replacement rate for a Malaysian male of average income was 41% in 2012, while the net <lb/>replacement rate for a Malaysian male earning half the level of average income was 40.3% (OECD, <lb/>2013b). By comparison, the OECD average for these indicators was 68.3% and 79.5% respectively in <lb/>2014, with a replacement rate of around 70% of average income considered a reasonable benchmark for <lb/>pension system adequacy (OECD, 2015d) (Figure 14). EPF data indicates that 70% of 54-year old <lb/>members would not have enough savings to meet basic retirement needs if they retired at age 55, while <lb/>half of all retirees exhaust their savings in just five years. System immaturity is not an issue for <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s longstanding retirement system; it is the system settings that are delivering inadequate <lb/>retirement incomes, with B40 households especially vulnerable. Replacement rates under the private sector <lb/>scheme would not be expected to reach OECD levels in the absence of reforms. <lb/>The generous provision permitting early withdrawals ahead of the official retirement age and for <lb/>certain current consumption activities (housing, education, medical and religious reasons), undermines a <lb/>system designed to provide for retirement income. Compared to lowering mandatory contribution rates <lb/>by 30% -equivalent to the share of contributions that can be withdrawn before age 55 –the system of early <lb/>withdrawals adds bureaucracy and limits consumption opportunities for low-income households <lb/>post-retirement. Tightening the system for early withdrawals would boost system integrity and ultimately <lb/>improve replacement rates. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>27 <lb/>Figure 14. Pension replacement rates are low <lb/>Note: The data are for 2012 for Malaysia and for 2014 for OECD countries. The source publications assume investment returns of 3.5% <lb/>per annum for Malaysia, whereas a 3% per annum return was assumed for OECD countries. <lb/>Source: OECD (2013b), Pensions at a Glance Asia-Pacific 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_asia-2013-en; OECD (2015c), <lb/>Pensions at a Glance 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_glance-2015-en. <lb/>Furthermore, replacement rates lack progressivity, implying that the pension system does relatively <lb/>little to boost the retirement incomes of low-income workers. The aforementioned reforms to improve <lb/>the progressivity of income distribution pre-and post-retirement would also contribute to Malaysian <lb/>replacement rates converging to OECD standards. <lb/>In addition, reliance on a single, publicly-owned fund for the investment of pension contributions <lb/>appears to be lowering replacement rates through lower average investment returns. As a public institution, <lb/>the EPF&apos;s mandate contains investment restrictions that limit its ability to maximise returns, <lb/>resulting in an investment strategy that is conservative by global standards (51% of total investment <lb/>is in fixed-income products including Malaysian Government Securities). Since 2013, tax exemptions have <lb/>been offered to encourage individuals to invest in Private Retirement Schemes outside of the EPF, but the <lb/>take-up rate has been low. Further efforts to open the pension market to competition from alternative <lb/>providers and to liberalise restrictions on EPF investment would improve replacement rates over the <lb/>long term. <lb/>High contribution rates contribute to informality, low saving and reduced consumption growth <lb/>Mandatory contributions to the EPF for the majority of private-sector workers ordinarily <lb/>amount to 23-24% of wages: an 11% employee contribution plus a 12-13% employer contribution. The <lb/>employee contribution was temporarily reduced to 8% until the end of 2017 as a 2016 Budget revision <lb/>measure to boost short-term growth, but employees can choose to opt out of the reduction. <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s usual mandatory contribution rate is above the OECD average of 20.3% in 2014 and <lb/>towards the upper end of pension contribution rates in the Asia-Pacific region. Malaysia&apos;s high <lb/>contribution rates are in part a product of its overall approach to taxes, transfers and social expenditure, <lb/>with the pension system required to do more heavy lifting than in many countries. Although there is no <lb/>single global standard rate, with the optimal contribution level depending on the particular <lb/>circumstances of the country, Malaysia&apos;s contribution rates are high for its income level. According to one <lb/>global pension system indicator, which compares the adequacy, sustainability and integrity of pension <lb/>systems, the top three ranked countries have rates of 13.4% (Denmark), 20.9% (Netherlands) <lb/>and 9.5% (Australia) (Mercer and Australian Centre for Financial Studies, 2015). <lb/>At around 60%, Malaysia&apos;s low pension coverage rate as a proportion of its labour force indicates that <lb/>high contribution rates may be deterring the entrance of workers into the formal sector. Labour force <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>28 <lb/>formalisation would improve the effectiveness of government policies including tax and social welfare, <lb/>with lower pension contribution rates for low-income workers one way to realign incentives to encourage <lb/>formalisation. As a benchmark for pension coverage, Malaysia could seek convergence with the OECD <lb/>average of around 86% in 2014. <lb/>The low rate of household saving may also indicate that contribution rates are too high for the current <lb/>level of household income. Household saving averaged around 1.5% of disposable income in 2013 or <lb/>-5.8% if mandatory contribution rates are excluded, indicating that Malaysian households are <lb/>borrowing heavily against their deferred income. While EPF returns have exceeded average borrowing costs <lb/>since 2009, the cost of servicing these debts may ultimately exceed the returns on pension earnings. <lb/>Evaluating whether contribution rates are appropriate in balancing current and future consumption needs <lb/>should also form part of discussions on pension reform, subject to broader consideration of complementary <lb/>policies for social protection. <lb/>Maintaining universal access to quality healthcare <lb/>An accessible healthcare system that supports increasing healthy life expectancy is not only integral <lb/>to well-being and inclusiveness, but is a necessary condition for a productive labour force. Malaysia&apos;s <lb/>significant investment in public healthcare has complemented broader initiatives to alleviate poverty in <lb/>tackling premature mortality. This has contributed to life expectancy increasing from 64.6 years in 1966 <lb/>to 74.7 in 2014. Although Malaysia&apos;s life expectancy is still below the OECD average, it performs as well <lb/>as the top 30% of OECD member countries in terms of the quality of self-reported health. Over the same <lb/>period, improved maternal and child healthcare has markedly reduced infant mortality per 1000 live births <lb/>from 75.5 to 6.6. <lb/>Malaysia provides universal healthcare through a heavily subsidised public system, supplemented by <lb/>private healthcare for people who can afford it. Public system patients pay a nominal sum for treatment, <lb/>while fees for private healthcare services are paid fully out-of-pocket by the patients themselves, their <lb/>employers, or insurance companies (PEMANDU, 2012). The public share of healthcare expenditure was <lb/>55% in 2014, while the respective shares of private system patients&apos; out-of-pocket expenditure and <lb/>private insurance were 79% and 14% of private healthcare expenditure, as private health insurance markets <lb/>have low saturation. <lb/>Addressing the increasing burden on the public system <lb/>High out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare – representing 35% of total healthcare expenditure as <lb/>of 2014 compared to an OECD average of 14% – is contributing to polarisation in the provision of <lb/>healthcare services by socio-economic status (Figure 15). Use of private services increases with <lb/>household income, while dependence on public services increases the poorer the household. This is <lb/>especially the case for inpatients, who require more intensive care, as opposed to outpatients, who require <lb/>mainly primary care. Access to highly-subsidised public healthcare ensures low incidences of catastrophic <lb/>and impoverishing expenditures or deferral of medical treatment for financial reasons; however, it is <lb/>resulting in an overburdening of the public health system. <lb/>Many medical specialists have been leaving the public system to take better remunerated <lb/>positions in the private system, creating shortages of critical staff. On one estimation, almost 70% of <lb/>medical specialists are in the private sector, but only 30% of complicated cases requiring specialists are <lb/>managed there (Syed, 2014). This lopsided allocation of medical specialists has led to rising incidences <lb/>of overcrowding, long waiting times, delayed consultation and late admission for emergency cases (EPU, <lb/>2015c). It also reduces the inclusiveness of healthcare as private facilities are typically located in <lb/>wealthier urban areas. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>29 <lb/>Figure 15. Poor households are more reliant on public-sector health care services <lb/>Source: WHO Global Health Expenditure (database); IHSR (2013), Malaysia Health Care Demand Analysis: Inequalities in Healthcare <lb/>Demand &amp; Simulation of Trends and Impact of Potential Changes in Healthcare Spending. <lb/>Malaysia has taken steps to ease the burden on the urban public health system and improve access to <lb/>quality healthcare for low-income urban residents. The operational hours of some public outpatient <lb/>clinics have been extended to increase access to primary care, catering to the irregular working hours of <lb/>the urban poor. The government has also introduced &quot; cluster hospitals &quot; arrangements whereby facilities in <lb/>the same geographical location pool resources to better manage patient flows. Retention packages have <lb/>been developed to increase compensation and allow for flexible working arrangements as an incentive <lb/>for medical doctors and specialists to remain in the public system. <lb/>Limited access remains an impediment to equitable universal healthcare in some rural areas. <lb/>Inadequate transport infrastructure, low economies of scale and low incentives for professionals to work in <lb/>rural and remote villages are among the challenges to the establishment of urban-equivalent facilities in <lb/>remote areas. Nonetheless, mobile clinics in the form of &quot; flying doctors &quot; and vehicle, boat and bus <lb/>equivalents help provide services in these areas and connectivity to urban facilities. Malaysia <lb/>continues to plan for the appropriate infrastructure and technologies necessary to ensure the optimal and <lb/>equitable provision of health services in these communities. <lb/>The private system also suffers from a shortage of qualified professionals, most acutely with <lb/>respect to qualified nurses. In contrast to the migration of doctors to the private system, many trained <lb/>nurses have shifted to public hospitals attracted by better compensation packages and training <lb/>opportunities. Private hospitals find it difficult to send their nurses for post-basic training due to a <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>30 <lb/>shortage in training capacity (MPC, 2015). Despite the shortage of nurses in the private sector, 8 000 <lb/>nursing graduates mainly from private colleges remained unemployed in 2012 due to a lack of <lb/>necessary skills, in particular communication skills, and inadequate training. As most government <lb/>hospitals have their feeder colleges, they are unable to employ graduates from the private nursing <lb/>colleges. Most private hospitals prefer to hire graduates from public universities, who are perceived to have <lb/>the necessary academic and employability skills (Nalini, 2014). To narrow skills and job mismatches, an <lb/>integrated and well-structured programme encompassing universities, the government, and public and <lb/>private medical institutions is required, as is a long-term view of skills training and a more flexible <lb/>regulatory framework including with respect to labour conditions. For this purpose, the government and <lb/>private colleges offer post-basic training course for private-sector nurses. <lb/>Figure 16.

			<body>Enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s total expenditure on health amounted to 4% of GDP in 2014, below other Southeast <lb/>Asian countries and the OECD average (Figure 16A). However, healthcare spending has outpaced GDP <lb/>since 2000 and is expected to increase in line with rising living standards, technological development <lb/>and the acceleration of population ageing (Figure 16B). Research on OECD and BRIICS countries <lb/>has shown that while income and ageing effects account for a large share of rising health expenditure, <lb/>health policies and institutions can help contain costs and provide opportunities to increase efficiency <lb/>(OECD, 2013c). <lb/>Enhancing effectiveness and efficiency will be key to ensuring the longer-term sustainability of <lb/>the healthcare system. Strengthening preventive health provision through primary care would reduce <lb/>recourse to more costly hospital care. Achieving high-quality primary care is a key priority in nearly every <lb/>OECD country, given the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses, quicker discharges from hospitals and <lb/>rising public expectations of seamless, co-ordinated care. Establishing an integrated primary care system <lb/>employing the &quot; family doctor &quot; concept, which provides multi-disciplinary services including risk factor <lb/>identification, risk intervention packages and clinical management of diseases, is one way to achieve this <lb/>goal. Further efficiency gains could be achieved by implementing domiciliary healthcare in a <lb/>community setting to cater to patients requiring long-term nursing care upon early discharge from <lb/>hospital. <lb/>Simplifying and streamlining the regulatory framework would also deliver efficiency gains. <lb/>Streamlining licence renewal and accreditation of medical institutions could reduce transaction costs <lb/>(EPU, 2015c; MPC, 2015). Allowing public-sector hospitals greater autonomy in the allocation of <lb/>resources would also increase efficiency gains and better adapt healthcare services to local conditions. <lb/>Consistent with the ambitions of the Ministry of Health&apos;s ICT Strategic Plan 2016-2020, increased use <lb/>of information and communications technology (ICT) systems would promote efficiency gains by <lb/>enabling televisual primary care consultations (tele-primary care) and integrating the management of <lb/>patients&apos; health-related information (lifetime health records). Utilising the existing National Registration <lb/>Identity Card (MyKad) system in implementing the lifetime health record system would deliver <lb/>efficiency gains by exploiting synergies. Reforming the financing structure to ensure sustainability of the <lb/>healthcare system has long been a government target (OECD, 2015e). Attempts to introduce a <lb/>public healthcare insurance system have not met with agreement among stakeholders, despite intensive <lb/>debates regarding cost sharing and the impact on quality and access to the services (Leng and Hong, <lb/>2014). Irrespective of whether public healthcare insurance is utilised in the future, rising healthcare costs <lb/>accompanying population ageing will need to be accounted for in fiscal planning (Lee, 2015). In principle, <lb/>private health insurance could make a greater contribution to managing rising healthcare costs, reducing <lb/>the burden on the public healthcare system and driving improvements in preventive care. In practice, <lb/>private health insurance is voluntary in Malaysia, with a low uptake so far resulting in a modest overall <lb/>contribution to health expenditure and high out-of-pocket expenses for private healthcare (Figure 17). Tax <lb/>relief for premiums have sought to raise the contribution of private health insurance with limited <lb/>success, but as household incomes continue to rise renewed efforts could have more success. The <lb/>scarcity of net taxpaying households suggests a levy, such as a surcharge on high-income individuals <lb/>who do not take out private health insurance, would have a stronger incentive effect than tax relief. High-<lb/>income households would thereby contribute to either private healthcare through insurance or to <lb/>government revenue to fund the public system. An expanded private insurance market may also help <lb/>promote preventive care, as insurance providers in countries such as the United States and Australia <lb/>encourage utilisation of free or subsidised preventive health services to reduce future expenses. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>32 <lb/>Figure 17. Private insurance could fund a higher share of health expenditure <lb/>% of total private health expenditure <lb/>Source: Global Health Observatory, World Health Organisation data repository. <lb/>Narrowing the regional development gap <lb/>Malaysia&apos;s rapid and relatively inclusive development since independence has achieved <lb/>impressive reductions in overall inequality. However, despite lower regional inequality being a priority <lb/>of Malaysia&apos;s economic and social development strategy, regional differences remain large and have <lb/>been widening in recent years. In 2014, the per capita GDP of Malaysia&apos;s richest state was almost eight <lb/>times that of the poorest, having widened significantly since 2011 (Figure 18.A). More broadly, the <lb/>socio-economic development gap is substantial, most notably in terms of relative income inequality, <lb/>healthcare and access to information (Figure 18.B). <lb/>Regional inequality reflects the combination of historical, geographical and socio-economic <lb/>factors that have favoured the development of western Peninsular Malaysia. These richer states have <lb/>benefited from their location on global trade routes, with trade and investment facilitating the rapid <lb/>development of industry and commerce. Growth in eastern Peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo Island <lb/>states has relied more on primary industries, with slower development of infrastructure and human capital. <lb/>These states are dominated by mountainous terrain or dense tropical rainforests, with challenging <lb/>geography and low population density creating impediments to the efficient provision of public services. <lb/>Despite these challenges, Malaysia has achieved near universal supply of reliable electricity and water <lb/>supply and is making significant investments in improving transport and telecommunications <lb/>infrastructure, education and healthcare. Even so, more can be done to further reduce regional <lb/>differences. <lb/>The 9th Malaysia Plan (2006-10) created five regional economic corridors focused on attracting <lb/>additional investment and creating jobs in target industries based on regional comparative advantages. <lb/>Federal government financial incentives and streamlined regulatory approvals are offered to fast-track <lb/>private sector investment and infrastructure improvements. Between 2011 and 2014, the corridors have <lb/>attracted almost MYR 175 billion in investment and created 427 000 jobs (Table 1). The 11th Malaysia <lb/>Plan increased the focus on programmes to raise skills training and entrepreneurship, while also improving <lb/>the targeting of support to the needs of each economic corridor. For example, in the East Coast Economic <lb/>Region, the entrepreneurship development programme is targeting women and youth to address <lb/>relatively high unemployment of these persons in the region. The Sabah Development Corridor programme <lb/>is providing skills training to upgrade agro-based industry and tourism with an aim to exploit rich natural <lb/>endowments. The Iskandar Economic Development Zone has utilised investment liberalisation to <lb/>develop target industries, becoming an emerging hub for sectors such as higher education and medical <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>33 <lb/>tourism (attracting patients from neighbouring countries for high-quality, private sector care at <lb/>competitive prices). <lb/>Figure 18. Increasing development gaps between states <lb/>Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia, and MRRD (2016), The 2014 Statistics Bulletin. <lb/>Recent policy priorities issues include raising rural well-being and stimulating economic <lb/>activities utilising land and natural resources. Initiatives are ongoing to develop rural infrastructure, <lb/>increasingly in collaboration with non-government organisations and private companies, and <lb/>government-linked corporations that provide financial contributions to these projects as contributions <lb/>to corporate social responsibility. Although income inequality and differences in access to public services <lb/>such as education, medical services and basic infrastructure between urban and rural areas have narrowed <lb/>since the 1970s (EPU, 2015d), targeted support to improve education and healthcare services are still <lb/>required as a basis for improving well-being. T argeted educational support for students from socio-<lb/>economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more numerous in rural areas, would invigorate <lb/>social mobility and enhance overall education outcomes. <lb/>As noted in the preceding section on healthcare, responding to the acceleration of ageing in rural <lb/>areas, improving access to quality medical care and strengthening preventive and primary care is also <lb/>necessary to improve well-being in rural communities. This could contribute to narrowing life expectancy <lb/>gaps vis-à-vis advanced economies. <lb/>To narrow the income gap, it is necessary to create a resilient economic structure in rural areas by <lb/>promoting rural economic activities and decent employment opportunities (EPU, 2015d). Only 8.9% of <lb/>the rural population attained tertiary education in 2015. The unemployment rate for rural women with a <lb/>tertiary degree was 7.4% in 2015, substantially higher than the 3.8% rate for their urban counterparts. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/>34 <lb/>Encouraging agro-based processing activities and eco-tourism that utilise regional assets offers business <lb/>opportunities in rural areas. Enhancing connectivity such as road and broadband internet with urban <lb/>areas enlarges business opportunities for rural enterprises and should continue to be central to reducing <lb/>regional inequality. To realise the business potential fully the government needs to implement a <lb/>programme to support rural entrepreneurs through skills training, in particular for e-commerce, which <lb/>contributes to linking consumers directly with rural entrepreneurs. <lb/>Table 1.

Private sector initiatives such as iCube – which provides a dynamic co-working <lb/>space, financial and expert support for local young entrepreneurs in Kuching (Sarawak state) – also <lb/>play a critical role in maximising the growth potential of regions. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)3 <lb/></body>
