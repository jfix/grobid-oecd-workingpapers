	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This working paper provides a broad picture of official financial flows for infrastructure development in<lb/> developing countries by bilateral and multilateral development partners. Multilateral development<lb/> banks are further examined in a special section. The paper offers an overview of volumes and<lb/> distributions of financial flows, including those channelled to private sector operations and those<lb/> mobilised from the private sector by guarantees, syndicated loans and collective investment vehicles.<lb/> This report, which builds on previous work on the topic, will contribute to research and policy dialogue on<lb/> filling the financial gap in infrastructure in developing countries. It will also support the monitoring of<lb/> Sustainable Development Goal 9 and the discussions of the G20 on infrastructure development.<lb/></div>
