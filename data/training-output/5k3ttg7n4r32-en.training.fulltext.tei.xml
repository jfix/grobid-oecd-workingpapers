			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The state of the financial system in Europe is not a happy one. The global financial crisis of 2007-<lb/>2009 has turned into the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010-2012. While a strong financial sector can<lb/> support economic growth, a weak sector amplifies an economic downturn. <ref type="biblio">Reinhart and Rogoff (2009)<lb/></ref> show that an economic downturn in the aftermath of a financial crisis tends to be longer.<lb/> The aim of this paper is to review the state of the banking sector in Europe. We examine the<lb/> deleveraging trends, including the impact of state aid restrictions. Next, we review the state of financial<lb/> integration in Europe. While cross-border banking flows promoted economic growth, it also fuelled a<lb/> credit boom in some of the peripheral countries (notably Ireland, Portugal and the Baltics). Following the<lb/> usual pattern, these credit booms turned into a bust. The dynamics in these peripheral countries are shown<lb/> in detail. Finally, we review the capital positions and the remaining systemic risks in the European<lb/> banking system.<lb/> Moving to the policy implications, the paper examines the impact of the deleveraging on the credit<lb/> supply. Are we experiencing a credit crunch in Europe, or not? A strong recapitalisation of the European<lb/> banking sector may prevent a prolonged credit crunch scenario. This would follow the US, which has<lb/> good experience with a strong recapitalisation approach of their banking sector in 2009. The financial<lb/> crisis has also lead to consolidation in the financial industry. This reduces the competition at the country<lb/> level. Finally, the sovereign debt crisis has fragmented the European financial system, hampering the<lb/> transmission of monetary policy and weakening competition. A move to Banking Union can counter the<lb/> current fragmentation tendencies and move Europe back to an integrated and resilient banking system.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 investigates the deleveraging trends in the European<lb/> banking system. The impact of state aid on downsizing banks is also examined. Section 3 reviews the<lb/> impact of the crises on the integration of the European banking system. Section 4 measures the capital<lb/> positions of banks and provides estimates for the capital shortage in the European banking system, as of<lb/> November 2013. Section 5 moves to the policy impact on the credit supply (do we experience a credit<lb/> crunch?) and on competition. Section 6 concludes and provides policy recommendations.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Deleveraging trends<lb/></head>

			<p>An important lesson from financial crises is that financing conditions for banks and firms are key<lb/> mechanisms in turning financial crises into recession (<ref type="biblio">Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen and Yesiltas, 2012</ref>). In the<lb/> upswing, finance is readily available leading to further expansion. By contrast, in the downturn, finance is<lb/> constrained leading to further contraction. <ref type="biblio">Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)</ref> have dubbed the term &apos;credit cycles&apos;<lb/> for the pro-cyclical nature of the financial system. In this section, we examine the balance sheets of the<lb/> country banking systems as well as individual banks to examine whether banks are deleveraging (that is<lb/> shortening their balance sheet) in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.<lb/></p>

This<lb/> paper was prepared as background for a seminar on the European banking sector at the OECD. We are grateful<lb/> to Piritta Sorsa, Eckhard Wurzel and seminar participants at the OECD for useful comments on an earlier<lb/> draft.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 6<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 State of balance sheets (aggregate trends)<lb/></head>

			<p>We start with an aggregate view of banking balance sheets to gauge the overall deleveraging<lb/> trend by examining total assets in the banking system at the country level. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a detailed<lb/> breakdown of total assets to see country trends in overall banking in the European Union (EU) after the<lb/> crisis. It is remarkable that the size of the banking system did not shrink. We use the year 2008 as general<lb/> benchmark for most countries, with the year 2007 for the UK. Although the global financial crisis<lb/> started in Autumn 2008, the full extent was not yet incorporated in end-2008 figures (accounting is often<lb/> lagging) with the exception of the UK, where the impact of the Lehman failure in London was<lb/> immediately felt with a decline of total assets of EUR 1,240 billion (12% drop from 2007 to 2008).<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows that the overall size of the EU banking system is flat from 2008 to 2009 and increases<lb/> thereafter till 2011 and then levels off. So, there is no overall deleveraging trend in Europe. The 2008-2013<lb/> change is +3%, as reported in the final column in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Nevertheless, some crisis-stricken countries,<lb/> like Belgium (-17%), Cyprus (-15), Estonia (-13), Greece (-10), Ireland (-39), Latvia and Lithuania (-11)<lb/> and Luxembourg (-20), show a major decline over this period.<lb/></p>

			<p>We investigate two specific dimensions of deleveraging in the EU in more detail (reported in the<lb/> bottom rows of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). First, we examine the impact of the global financial crisis on the banking system<lb/> of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (CESEE) and the sub-set of the Baltics. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates<lb/> that the overall group of CESEE does not show a decline in banking. The size of the banking system has<lb/> increased over the 2008-2013 period with 12%, well above the EU-average of 3%. Only the Baltics<lb/> (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) show a reversal of 12%.<lb/> Second, we examine the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on the banking system of the<lb/> peripheral (Portugal, Ireland and Greece) and distressed (later extended with Spain and Italy) countries.<lb/> The crisis started in the peripheral countries with Greece and Ireland receiving a rescue package in 2010<lb/> and Portugal in 2011. Later on, doubts started about the fiscal position of Spain and Italy, turning the<lb/> peripheral group of countries into the distressed countries. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> indicates a strong contraction of the<lb/> banking system of the peripheral countries (-25%). The strong drop is caused by Ireland, the largest<lb/> peripheral country. There has been an on-going shrinkage of the Irish banking system since the<lb/> global financial crisis culminating in a 39% drop. The overall decline of 39% in Ireland is caused by a<lb/> reduction of both foreign banking (-56%) and domestic banking (-28%). Moving to the distressed<lb/> countries, it appears that there are no signs yet of a major reversal of banking in Spain and Italy. But it is<lb/> too early to have a verdict on these countries, where the sovereign debt crisis erupted in 2011/2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 State of balance sheets (individual banks)<lb/></head>

			<p>After reviewing country trends, we move to individual banks. The aim is to review developments in<lb/> banks&apos; total assets over time. We take the top 30 European banks, selected on the basis of Tier 1<lb/> capital at end 2011 published by The Banker (2012). <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that there was a drop immediately<lb/> after 2008, followed by a gradual recovery from 2009 to 2011. Total assets again dropped from 2011 to<lb/> 2012, only at a slower pace. The overall decline from 2008 to 2012 is -6%. This picture is different from<lb/> total assets of the banking system, which shows a smooth pattern of growth over these periods without any<lb/> decline. The mandatory downsizing of several top 30 banks, which received state aid (see below), causes<lb/> this difference. The more granular approach from the top 30 banks may be more informative than total<lb/> banking system assets to examine lending dynamics during the crisis.<lb/></p>

Several major banks have experienced a large decline in their balance from<lb/> 2007/8 to 2012: Barclays (-15%), UBS (-24), ING (-12), RBS (-38), Commerzbank (-43), KBC (-28),<lb/> Lloyds (-18), Allied Irish Banks (-32), ABN Amro (-62) and several Landesbanken (about -20). All these<lb/> banks, except for Barclays, received state aid during the crisis. There is thus a significant decline, pushed<lb/> by the European Commission&apos;s strong stance on restructuring as a condition for receiving state aid. The<lb/> Commission&apos;s state aid conditions are geared on returning a bank in need of state aid towards a viable<lb/> bank (inter alia by downsizing). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>			<figure>indicates that 13 out of the top 30 European banks received state<lb/> aid during the global financial crisis (2007-2009) and subsequent European sovereign debt crisis (2010-<lb/>2012). The overall downsizing of the group of state aid banks is 23%. By contrast, other banks have<lb/> expanded their business during this period: Standard Chartered (+55% ), Santander (+21), Nordea<lb/> (+43), BBVA (+17) and DNB Group (+64). The large expansion of Standard Chartered has been<lb/> achieved in Asia. The overall expansion of the group of non-state aid banks is 4`%.<lb/></figure>

			<head>3 State of integration<lb/></head>

			<p>The Single Financial Market promotes financial integration. Financial integration allows for cross-<lb/>border provision of financial services. In the banking sector, cross-border credit has an impact on credit<lb/> supply and competition in the host market. Cross-border business can be measured by the geographical<lb/> spread of financial firms&apos; assets. <ref type="biblio">Sullivan (1994)</ref> develops the Transnationality Index to measure the<lb/> internationalisation of multinationals. This Transnationality Index is calculated as an unweighted average<lb/> of 1) foreign assets to total assets, 2) foreign income to total income, and 3) foreign employment to total<lb/> employment. Although an index based on three indicators is more stable, this paper focuses on the<lb/> first indicator for banking: foreign assets to total assets.<lb/> As one of our main research purposes is to investigate the impact on credit supply, we motivate the<lb/> choice of the asset indicator for banking. The impact on credit provision is related to a bank&apos;s assets in<lb/> several ways. The impact can be thought of as preventing a temporary reduction of credit availability<lb/> (credit crunch) through shortening of balance sheets by a strong reduction of the loan book in a particular<lb/> country. Another impact is related to the financial stability of the total banking system, which might be<lb/> jeopardised by a fire sale of assets or other externalities impacting negatively on aggregate investment in a<lb/> country (<ref type="biblio">Acharya, 2009</ref>).<lb/> Thus, we take size and distribution of bank assets to represent the impact on credit supply. This is in<lb/> accordance with the &quot; credit view &quot; of the impact of banking on the economy (<ref type="biblio">Bernanke, 1983</ref>). This<lb/> section starts with broad empirical evidence on cross-border banking in Europe. The aggregate data focus<lb/> on the recipient (host) countries and indicate that cross-border banking has gradually been descending<lb/> since its pre-crisis peak in 2007. Nevertheless, cross-border banking is still persuasive with a share of<lb/> about 25% of total bank assets in host countries (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> below).<lb/></p>

			<p>Another line of research looks at the cross-border expansion of individual banks from their home<lb/> base. Extending earlier work (<ref type="biblio">Schoenmaker and Oosterloo, 2005</ref>; Schoenmaker and Van <ref type="biblio">Laecke, 2007</ref>),<lb/> we adopt this approach to measure the international operations of banks. Detailed data on the<lb/> geographical segmentation of the 30 largest banks in Europe is collected, as these large financial<lb/> intermediaries are cross-border oriented. Large European banks have significant international operations<lb/> (close to 50% on average). The dynamics and choice of variables are explored in detail below.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Integration in banking sector (aggregate trends)<lb/></head>

			<p>Integration can be measured by the cross-border penetration within the EU. We investigate the rate<lb/> of cross-border bank penetration, defined as cross-border bank assets -both from branches and<lb/> subsidiaries of foreign owned banks-as a share of total bank assets in a country. This measurement is<lb/> detailed as the ECB collects and publishes structural indicators of the EU banking system. <ref type="figure">Figure 4<lb/></ref> presents the cross-border penetration. Within the EU, the cross-border penetration has gone up from 12%<lb/> in 1997 to 21% in 2007. It shows a decline after the crisis from 21 to 17%. But the cross-border business<lb/> from EU countries remains sizeable. Business from third countries is relatively stable around 8%<lb/> throughout the period. Overall cross-border penetration remains solid with a fall back to the pre-crisis level<lb/> of 2004. There are no major reductions in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 11<lb/> Figure 4. Cross-border penetration in the European Union<lb/> Note: Share of bank assets from other EU countries and third countries, as a percentage of total bank assets. The ratios are<lb/> calculated for the EU-27.<lb/> Source: EU Banking Structures, ECB.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Moving to the country level, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports cross-border penetration from EU countries. At the<lb/> aggregate EU level, cross-border penetration decreased from 21% in 2007 to 16% in 2012 (as also<lb/> shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> below). This gradual and modest decline hides some significant dynamics at the<lb/> country level. Belgium shows a large increase of 29 percentage points (see right-hand side column of<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), due to the split, and subsequent sale, of Fortis to BNP Paribas (<ref type="biblio">Belgian</ref> and Luxembourg parts)<lb/> and the Dutch government (Dutch part). By contrast, the Netherlands pictures a temporary reduction in<lb/> cross-border penetration to about 4% in 2008/2009. Because the Dutch supervisor slowed down the<lb/> transfer of the different parts of ABN Amro, only the 2010 figures show for the first time the final transfer<lb/> to RBS and Deutsche Bank. Large declines in cross-border banking are found in the New Member States:<lb/> Czech Republic (-11 percentage points), Estonia (-12), Cyprus (-16), Latvia (-15), Lithuania (-13), Poland<lb/> (-19), Romania (-16). Also the United Kingdom has had a large contraction of 8 percentage points. These<lb/> countries experience some major reversals of cross-border inflows in the aftermath of the global financial<lb/> crisis.<lb/> 0%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 15%<lb/> 20%<lb/> 25%<lb/> 30%<lb/> 35%<lb/> Cross-border penetration<lb/> From EU countries<lb/> From third countries<lb/> Total cross-border<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 12<lb/></figure>

Part of the cross-border<lb/> fragmentation is regulatory driven. Some supervisors demand that assets and liabilities need to be matched<lb/> locally. Moreover, there is an emerging tendency among supervisors to ask for a subsidiary rather than a<lb/> branch (<ref type="biblio">Schoenmaker, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 13<lb/> Figure 5. Cross-border penetration in the EU (in % of total banking assets)<lb/> Figure 6. Cross-border penetration in CESEE and Periphery (in % of total banking assets)<lb/> The ECB data show a sharp decline for foreign penetration into emerging Europe. Cross-border<lb/> penetration from EU countries (i.e. Western banks active in emerging Europe) dropped with a full<lb/> 10 percentage points from 78% in 2008 to 68% in 2009 in Table 3. That is a major reversal of integration.<lb/> In particular, Poland, Romania and the Baltics were badly hit. Poland shows the largest shift: a<lb/> 15 percentage points increase from 2007 to 2008 followed by a 19 percentage points decline from 2008 to<lb/> 2009. Nevertheless, Poland experiences a large increase of total banking assets of 32% from 2008 to 2013<lb/> (see Table 1). The Baltics experiences a 13 percentage point decline in cross-border penetration over the<lb/> 2008-2012 period.<lb/></figure>

			<p>More generally, the global financial crisis reversed the large upward swing in cross-border banking<lb/> prior to the crisis. Cross-border penetration in emerging Europe has returned to pre-crisis levels of about<lb/> 65% (asset weighted average). The Vienna Initiative -aimed at maintaining cross-border banking flows<lb/> from Western to Eastern Europe-may have prevented a further decline of cross-border banking into<lb/> emerging Europe (<ref type="biblio">Vienna Initiative, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The CESEE figures indicate the vulnerability of emerging Europe to adverse developments in those<lb/> foreign banking groups whose subsidiaries or branches have systemic presence in individual concerned<lb/> countries. Our analysis is consistent with newly emerging evidence that the viability of the host country<lb/> branch and/or subsidiary is dependent on the performance of the parent bank (<ref type="biblio">Bruno and Shin, 2012;<lb/> Jeon, Olivero and Wu, 2013</ref>). CESEE countries are thus very dependent on the wellbeing of the banks<lb/> headquartered in the EU-15 countries. CESEE countries may thus have an incentive to join Banking<lb/> Union. In a Banking Union, these banks would be supervised and resolved at the European level. By<lb/> opting in, CESEE would get a say in the supervision and resolution of these banks that are important for<lb/> their economy. The crisis has shown that the current CESEE strategy of subsidiarisation offers no<lb/> protection against reversals of cross-border banking credit.<lb/> Finally, we analyse the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis. Tables 1 and 3 indicate a strong<lb/> contraction of the peripheral countries, both on total banking system (-25% in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) and the foreign<lb/> participation within the total banking system (-9 percentage points in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). The strong drop is caused<lb/> by Ireland, the largest peripheral country. There has been an on-going shrinkage of the Irish banking<lb/> system since the global financial crisis (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Furthermore, cross-border banking has dropped<lb/> from 40% in 2007/2008 to 29% in 2012 (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). So, cross-border credit has contracted faster than<lb/> domestic credit in Ireland. Moving to the distressed countries, it appears that there are no signs yet of a<lb/> major reversal of cross-border banking in Spain and Italy (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). But it is too early to<lb/> have a verdict on these countries, where the sovereign debt crisis erupted in 2011/2012.<lb/> Summing up, integration has been reversed in the CESEE and peripheral countries, with a decline in<lb/> cross-border penetration from 2008 to 2012 with 12 and 9 percentage points respectively. The evidence<lb/> shows that the large Western European banks have thus withdrawn from the crisis-stricken countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 Integration in banking sector (individual banks)<lb/></head>

			<p>After reviewing the overall trends in European banking from a host country perspective, we move to<lb/> the internationalisation of banks from a home country perspective. As explained above, our proxy for<lb/> cross-border banking is related to a bank&apos;s foreign assets. It is interesting to distinguish between regional<lb/> expansion within Europe and global expansion of banks. The asset data are therefore broken down into<lb/> activities in the home market (h), the rest of the region (r), and the rest of the world (w). Our empirical<lb/> study of integration focuses on the large banks, as these are more international than their smaller<lb/> counterparts. Extending earlier work with Sander Oosterloo and Christiaan van Laecke (<ref type="biblio">Schoenmaker and<lb/> Oosterloo, 2005; Schoenmaker and Van Laecke, 2007</ref>), we select the 30 largest banks on the basis of<lb/> Tier 1 capital at end 2011 published by The Banker</p>

				<formula>(2012).<lb/></formula>

			<p>The purpose of the data exercise is to examine to what extent banks have significant international<lb/> operations. Following Schoenmaker and Oosterloo (2005), banks are grouped on the basis of their<lb/> geographic dispersion. The first two groups are truly international banks, as they have more than 50% of<lb/> business abroad. Global banks have less than 50% of business in the home country and the majority of<lb/> their international business in the rest of the world. Regional banks have also less than 50% of their<lb/> business in the home country, but the majority of their international business is in the rest of the region.<lb/> The third group is a runners-up group, labelled semi-international banks. These banks have 50 to 75% of<lb/> their business in the home country. International operations are still sizable at 25 to 50%. Finally, domestic<lb/> banks have more than 75% of their business in the home country.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the history of cross-border banking from a home country perspective for the EU.<lb/> Foreign business is calculated as a weighted average for the top 30 banks (weighted according to assets).<lb/> While the aggregate European banking statistics (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) suggest a decline of international<lb/> banking after the global financial crisis, individual bank data show a different pattern. Throughout the<lb/> period from 2000 to 2011, cross-border activities have been going steady with some differences. Large<lb/> European banks have significant international operations at close to 50%. The cross-border business within<lb/> Europe has remained stable at just above 20%, with a slight increase from 21% in 2008 to 23% in 2011<lb/> after the global financial crisis. Cross-border business to rest of the world has declined from 28% in 2008<lb/> to 24% in 2011. European banks, in particular German and Dutch banks, have been gradually retreating<lb/> from the United States, thereby making room for others to step in (<ref type="biblio">Schildbach and Wenzel, 2012</ref>). Banks<lb/> from Canada, China, and Japan have expanded their US business (in line with the general shift of<lb/> economic power from the West to the East). The overall presence of foreign banks in the United States has<lb/> remained stable (<ref type="biblio">Schoenmaker, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7. Geographic segmentation of Top 30 European banks<lb/> Note: Share of consolidated assets in home country, rest of Europe (region) and rest of world. The three ratios add up to 100%.<lb/> Source: Author&apos;s calculations based on annual reports.<lb/> The dynamics over the 2000 to 2011 period are interesting in two respects: (1) ups and downs of<lb/> internationalisation at particular banks; and (2) entry and exit of banks in the top 30. Foreign business of<lb/> the largest European banks remained high at about 50% throughout the 2000 to 2011 period. Big banks,<lb/> like HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and UBS, have kept their international orientation until today.<lb/> The foreign activities of Barclays increased from 25% in 2000 to 66% in 2011 (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> below). It<lb/> has thus moved from being a domestic bank to being a truly global bank. Barclays Capital, its<lb/> investment bank arm, has played a major role in Barclays&apos; internationalisation. The other large UK<lb/> bank, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), seemed to follow a similar pattern, but was caught by the financial<lb/> crisis. As part of the government rescue package, RBS had to downsize its international operations. Its<lb/> foreign business is now 38%, down from its peak in 2007 at 47%.<lb/> Fortis, a mid-sized bank operating on a regional scale in Europe, is a good example showing that a<lb/> failure of an international bank does not automatically reduce international banking. During the crisis, the<lb/> Belgian bank was split on national lines. The domestic Belgian part of Fortis was bought by BNP Paribas,<lb/> which added to the foreign business of BNP Paribas (moving from 22 to 34% cross-border business in<lb/> Europe in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The foreign Dutch part was acquired by ABN Amro and thus turned into a domestic<lb/> business (moving from 34 to 80% home country business in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 16<lb/></figure>

			<p>An overall conclusion is that most large banks have kept a strong international orientation after the<lb/> Global Financial Crisis. Some have even become larger through facilitated mergers and takeovers in order<lb/> to rescue ailing competitors. But other banks have been forced to deleverage deeply in response to state<lb/> aid. Although it is often argued that banks with state aid reduce their business in particular abroad, that is<lb/> not what we find in the data. It appears that the deleveraging occurred both at home and abroad.<lb/></p>

			<p>More generally, there are some significant shifts in cross-border business at the individual bank level.<lb/> Some large international banks have increased their business in the continents, that are less affected by the<lb/> crisis: HSBC and Standard Chartered in Asia, and Santander and BBVA in Latin America. Other European<lb/> banks have expanded their European business, such as BNP Paribas (see above), Banque Populaire CdE<lb/> and Danske Bank. By contrast, many others have downsized their cross-border business. The overall result<lb/> in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> is that the weighted average of the cross-border business of the top 30 banks remained<lb/> remarkably constant at 23% in the rest of the region and 24% in the rest of the world from 2007 to 2011.<lb/> Moving to the current situation, <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> documents the international activities of the 30 largest<lb/> European banks in 2011. Europe houses six global banks (three from the UK, two from Switzerland and<lb/> one from Germany) and seven regional banks from various European countries (reflecting financial<lb/> integration within the EU). All these banks have the majority of their business abroad. Furthermore,<lb/> Europe has eight semi-international banks, with sizeable business abroad (between 25 and 50%).<lb/> These (semi-)international banks have two faces. On the one hand, they play an important role in the<lb/> domestic economy and are thus systemic in the home country (except for Standard Chartered, which has<lb/> minor operations in the UK). Given the close connections between the national authorities and these big<lb/> banks, these banks are sometimes dubbed as national champions (<ref type="biblio">Boot, 1999</ref>). On the other hand, a large<lb/> part of their activities is abroad. As the national authorities do not take the cross-border externalities into<lb/> account, this may lead to coordination failure in case of a bailout (<ref type="biblio">Schoenmaker, 2013</ref>). So, while<lb/> international coordination may be needed most for these banks, the national authorities are also likely to<lb/> cling to their national champions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Differences in cross-border activity before and after the crisis<lb/></head>

			<p>The aggregate and individual data give a slightly differing message. Aggregate banking data suggests<lb/> a slight reversal after the crisis. Bottom-up data suggests that cross-border business of the largest banks<lb/> remain significant, with some major changes within the banking population. While banks are<lb/> deleveraging their international business, they also do that at the national level. But these are preliminary<lb/> conclusions, as the process of deleveraging is not yet finished at the European banks.<lb/></p>

			<p>The 2007-2009 global financial crisis started in the financial sector and quickly turned into a<lb/> global recession with a decline in output, employment, and trade. While the US is slowly resuming<lb/> economic growth, the European recovery is still very subdued. Two differences between the US and<lb/> Europe stand out. First, the US Treasury did a strong stress test of its main banks in 2009, and forced the<lb/> banks to remedy any capital shortfalls, defined in absolute dollar amounts, on a short notice. The early<lb/> and strong recapitalisation, mainly through equity issues, helped US banks to resume their role as<lb/> provider of credit to the economy. The European Banking Authority (EBA) conducted several stress<lb/> tests, but these tests were less strong. Moreover, the EBA allowed banks much time (up to<lb/> 9 months) to achieve the required capital levels defined as a capital ratio. The ratio approach provided<lb/> leeway for banks to remedy any shortfall by strengthening capital (retained earnings and equity issues)<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> and/or reducing their exposures by shortening their balance sheet (deleveraging). Unlike the US banks,<lb/> European banks have done very few equity issues. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows a comparison between the relative<lb/> amounts of bank equity issuances in the US compared to EU banks over the last 10 years. It shows<lb/> clearly that the US banks raised a lot more equity in a much more concentrated timeframe in order to<lb/> stabilize the banking system, compared to EU banks. In this context, the EU banks are lagging behind.<lb/> Second, Europe has suffered a second crisis, the sovereign debt crisis. The sovereign debt crisis has further<lb/> weakened the balance sheet of European banks.<lb/> This section provides an overview of the capital position of individual banks. If banks have too little<lb/> capital, they may find it difficult to grant new loans, potentially causing a &apos;credit crunch&apos;. Another third<lb/> item is the aggregate systemic risk in the financial system. This provides an indicator of potential<lb/> casualties in the financial sector, which may come at a cost for the taxpayer.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Comparison of bank equity issuances between EU and US<lb/></figure>

			<p>Note: In order to compare these recapitalisation efforts it is useful to relate them to the size of the banking system, so we will consider<lb/> a normalisation by (current) total assets. The monthly issuance (rolling average) is translated to annualised figures. The annualised<lb/> figures on equity issuance are presented as a percentage of total bank assets in the US, respectively EU.<lb/> Source: Dealogic data.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Capital position of individual banks<lb/></head>

			<p>Capital is a good indicator of the health of a financial institution. The regulatory capital ratio is a<lb/> useful starting point, but has some deficiencies (Acharya, <ref type="biblio">Schoenmaker and Steffen, 2011</ref>). First, the main<lb/> capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio, is based on risk-weighted assets (to be precise: Tier 1 equity divided<lb/> by risk weighted assets). Banks are allowed to use internal models to determine the risk weights. Research<lb/> shows that there is a strong heterogeneity in the application of risk weights by banks (Le <ref type="biblio">Leslé and<lb/> Avramova, 2012</ref>). Das and Sy (2012) find that risk weighted asset do not, in general, predict market<lb/> measures of risk. Moreover, certain asset classes, such as sovereign bonds in OECD countries, receive a<lb/> zero risk weight. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe has shown that these zero risk weights are not<lb/> justified. Next, the regulatory capital ratios are based on book values, which typically show a decline in<lb/> asset values with some delay. It is therefore useful to complement the regulatory ratios with market-based<lb/> indicators.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>			<figure>shows a market based leverage ratio. The market value (MV) based leverage ratio divides<lb/> the market capitalisation of a bank by its total assets. The latter benchmark is inspired by the new Basel III<lb/> leverage ratio of 3%. But it is strictly speaking different in the sense that the Basel leverage ratio is based<lb/> 0.0%<lb/> 0.1%<lb/> 0.2%<lb/> 0.3%<lb/> 0.4%<lb/> 0.5%<lb/> 0.6%<lb/> 0.7%<lb/> 0.8%<lb/> 0.9%<lb/> 2004 2006<lb/> 2007<lb/> 2008<lb/> 2009<lb/> 2010 2011<lb/> 2012 2013<lb/> Equity issuance<lb/> (annualised figures as % of total assets)<lb/> US banks<lb/> EU banks<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 20<lb/> on Tier 1 equity and includes both on-and off-balance exposures in total assets. Furthermore, we report<lb/> the book value leverage ratio (book value of Basel II Tier 1 equity divided by total assets). To see what<lb/> the quality of the outstanding loan portfolio of the individual banks is, we also report the amount of<lb/> NPLs and the ratio NPLs / total gross loans. Clearly visible are the high levels of NPLs in particular<lb/> Italy, but also in Spain and Greece.<lb/> Dexia provides a good illustration of the deficiency of the risk-weighted approach. Dexia reported<lb/> 10.4% on the Core Tier 1 Capital Ratio, just before its problems re-emerged in October 2011. This is<lb/> twice the minimum of 5% used as benchmark in the 2011 stress test. On the leverage measure, Dexia<lb/> scored 1.34% on book value of equity divided by total assets and 0.49% on market value of equity divided<lb/> by total assets (Acharya, Schoenmaker and Steffen, 2011). These figures were well below the future<lb/> regulatory benchmark of 3% for the Basel leverage ratio and signalled the problems at Dexia.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Which banks have the full trust of markets and can thus finance themselves without any problem?<lb/> Examples are well-capitalised banks such as HSBC, JP Morgan and Rabobank with leverage ratios around<lb/> 6%. The aim of restoring market confidence in banks can be interpreted conservatively as restoring<lb/> capitalisation of each bank in Europe at least to the level of capitalisation of these banks. The OECD<lb/> suggests that well-capitalised banks should have a leverage ratio of 5% (Blundell-<ref type="biblio">Wignall and Atkinson,<lb/> 2012</ref>). This is consistent with the recommendations of the Swiss Banking Commission and the UK<lb/> Independent Banking Commission (the so-called Vickers Committee) for the leverage ratio. The aim<lb/> would be to require banks to recapitalise up to 5% in a credible, confidence-boosting plan (well above the<lb/> future regulatory benchmark of 3%). In <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, we report the capital needed to restore capital to 3<lb/> respectively 5% (based on market values). In the basic scenario to restore capital to 3% of assets,<lb/> EUR 84 billion would be needed for the largest 60 banks. Note that only banks with a listing are<lb/> included for the market value based indicator in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. Non-listed banks, like Banque Populaire CdE,<lb/> Rabobank, the German Landesbanken, Crédit Mutuel, CaixaBank and ABN Amro, are excluded, as there<lb/> is no market value available for these banks. In the stronger OECD scenario to restore capital to 5% of<lb/> assets, EUR 365 billion is needed.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Systemic risk<lb/></head>

			<p>What are the remaining systemic risks in the financial sector? Each bank&apos;s contribution to systemic<lb/> risk can be measured as its systemic expected shortfall, i.e., its propensity to be undercapitalised when the<lb/> system as a whole is undercapitalised. The shortfall increases with the bank&apos;s leverage and with its<lb/> expected loss in the tail of the system&apos;s loss distribution. The V-Lab at the Stern School of Business, New<lb/> York University, has developed this measure of systemic risk (see, for example, Acharya, Engle and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Richardson, 2012, and Engle, Jondeau and Rockinger, 2012</ref>). The Systemic Expected Shortfall is<lb/> presented for the major European banks in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. The V-Lab selects the large publicly listed banks<lb/> (top 60 of listed banks).<lb/> The Expected Shortfall is calculated according to the method described in Acharya, Engle and<lb/> Richardson (2012). It is defined as the capital that a firm is expected to need if we have another<lb/> financial crisis, complying with a capital requirement threshold as a percentage of total assets. In our<lb/> analysis, this threshold is put at 3%. To calculate the Expected Shortfall, the method evaluates the losses<lb/> that an equity holder of a particular bank would face if there were a future crisis, which is defined as<lb/> a situation in when over the next six months the broad market falls by 40%. By measuring a bank&apos;s<lb/> sensitiveness to the market (e.g. through its beta), the V-Lab runs scenarios to measure the impact of the<lb/> market fall on the bank&apos;s equity. A general market fall of 40% is a rather tough scenario. In the stress-test<lb/> scenario, the total Expected Shortfall for the major European banks amounts to EUR 241 billion. This is<lb/> about three times as much as the recapitalisation scheme for the basic scenario with a 3% leverage ratio<lb/> (based on market values).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 21<lb/></figure>

			<p>All three measures for further capital needs (3% MV/Assets, 5% MV/Assets, Expected Shortfall)<lb/> point to a need for recapitalisation. The banks in need of the largest amounts of capital are Crédit Agricole,<lb/> Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Société Générale and RBS. It is telling that the official measure, book value of<lb/> equity to total assets at 3%, only reveals Crédit Agricole and Deutsche Bank of these five banks as<lb/> undercapitalised. More generally, almost all banks in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> report a book value leverage ratio above 3%.<lb/> Clearly, market value of equity and book value of equity show complementary insights. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9a<lb/></ref> and 9b, we regress the book value of equity (Basel II Tier 1 Capital) against the market value of equity. If<lb/> both metrics convey the same information, we would expect a regression line through the origin, in a 45°<lb/> angle. Both regression lines are not cutting through the origin, but below it. Apparently, the market values<lb/> relatively high book values conservatively.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 Impact on credit supply and competition<lb/></head>

			<p>Sections 2 to 4 lay the empirical foundation of the European banking sector for our examination of<lb/> the impact on credit supply and competition. These issues are discussed in turn.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1 Credit supply<lb/></head>

			<p>At the aggregate level, the Baltics and Ireland have witnessed a strong decline in bank assets,<lb/> combined with a reduction of cross-border supply of credit (Tables 1 and 3). So, foreign banks have<lb/> reduced their presence in these countries, which has not been replaced by domestic banks. By contrast,<lb/> the reduction in foreign credit has been replaced by domestic credit in other CESEE countries, notably<lb/> Poland. Next, Luxembourg and Belgium show a strong decline in assets at 25 and 10% respectively.<lb/> Foreign penetration has been flat for Luxembourg, indicating that domestic and foreign credit have gone<lb/> down hand in hand.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 10. Capital and weighted average assets for top 22 European banks<lb/> Source: Tables 2 and 6, Bankscope.<lb/></figure>

			<p>For individual banks, the trend in weighted average assets is not very revealing. Note that only banks<lb/> with a listing are included in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. Non-listed banks, like Banque Populaire CdE,<lb/> Rabobank, the German Landesbanken, Crédit Mutuel, CaixaBank, ABN Amro, and Allied Irish Banks, are<lb/> excluded from our Top 30 banks, as there is no market value available for these banks. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows a<lb/> stable pattern with a dip from 2008 to 2009 and a slow reduction in assets from 2011 onward. It may be<lb/> useful to distinguish between well-capitalised and less-capitalised banks to examine potential credit crunch<lb/> effects (<ref type="biblio">Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen and Yesiltas, 2012</ref>). To that purpose, we divide our group of 22 major<lb/> European banks in tertiles. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> ranks the banks from high to low market capitalisation divided by total<lb/> assets, based on year-end 2012 values. This is our market based leverage ratio. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>			<figure>indicates that the 1 st<lb/> tertile is well capitalised in the range from 4.3 to 9.4%. Banks, like Standard Chartered, HSBC and BBVA,<lb/> are in this group.

Those banks in the 1 st tertile, which are capitalised well above 4%, have a market-to-<lb/>book ratio above one. The market thus values the strength of this group of banks. Importantly, they also<lb/> show asset growth over the full period (except for a small dip from 2008 to 2009) and from year-<lb/>end-2012 to 2013-H1 (visible across all tertiles). By contrast, banks in the 2 nd tertile, between 2.8 and<lb/> 4.3% capital, and the 3 rd tertile, well below 3% capital, trade at a market-to-book ratio below one. Also,<lb/> they show a decline in asset growth compared to 2008.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions on credit supply<lb/></head>

			<p>How should we interpret these results? The new Basel III leverage ratio is 3%. A market based<lb/> leverage ratio below 3 to 4% may indicate that banks are not yet ready to support new lending. It appears<lb/> that several banks in Europe are still below this threshold and thus not yet ready to support recovery.<lb/> These banks, consisting of two out of the three tertiles, seem to contribute to a &apos;credit crunch&apos; in<lb/> Europe, by slowing down their supply of lending (deleveraging). Only the very well capitalised banks<lb/> increase their lending at a gradual pace. It should be noted that these are overall results based on total<lb/> assets of banks. More research on exact lending data, which is a sub-set of total assets, may be useful<lb/> to determine exact credit crunch effects.<lb/> The results suggest a link between capitalisation and deleveraging. Those banks that are weakly<lb/> capitalised improve their position through deleveraging (as well as building capital through retained<lb/> earnings). This is a slow and painstaking process, where the latest data suggest that there are severe<lb/> problems. That would in turn suggest that these banks are not likely to contribute to new lending, even if<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)94<lb/> 26<lb/> the recovery would start at some point. Only the 1 st tertile of very well capitalised banks (above 4 to 5%<lb/> market capitalisation to total assets) contribute to lending. The overall conclusion is that &apos;credit crunch&apos;<lb/> effects may be felt.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Competition<lb/></head>

			<p>Crisis management has led to consolidation in the banking sector through (sometimes forced) mergers<lb/> and acquisitions (M&amp;As) of ailing banks. As a result, some markets have become more concentrated.<lb/> But concentration is one only of several proxies to measure competition. Measuring competition in<lb/> banking is challenging. Interest margins may, for example, not be a good indicator of competition, as the<lb/> margin also reflects the credit risk of the borrower. Modern theory analyses the contestability of the<lb/> banking market (<ref type="biblio">Claessens and Laeven, 2004</ref>). Indicators for contestability include entry requirements<lb/> (for domestic and foreign banks), activity restrictions, and switching costs. There is no conclusive<lb/> evidence on changes in these indicators caused by the financial crisis.<lb/> We therefore investigate the more traditional measures of market structure. The presumption is that<lb/> more concentrated markets are less competitive. But it is not clear to what extent concentration measures<lb/> the intensity of competition. Another concern is the assumed one-way causality from market structure to<lb/> performance. Performance may also have an impact on market structure. Notwithstanding these concerns,<lb/> we provide some evidence on the increased concentration in the wake of the financial crisis. Increased<lb/> concentration is, at least, an indication of reduced competition.<lb/></p>

			<p>Concentration can be measured through the Herfindahl Index, which is the sum of per-bank market<lb/> shares squared (multiplied by 10 000). In principle, the European Commission (DG Competition) permits<lb/> mergers up to the threshold of 2 000 for the measured Herfindahl Index. Another common measure is<lb/> the n-bank concentration ratio: C n . We measure the C5 ratio, the sum of the market share of the<lb/> five largest banks. While the C n ratio only measures the top-end of the market, the Herfindahl Index<lb/> measures the competitiveness over the full market range and is therefore most informative.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The data are based on the EU structural financial indicators of the ECB. Using Bankscope data,<lb/> Bijlsma and Zwart (2013) find higher levels of concentration than the ECB. Tables 8 and 9 provide<lb/> the full data for all EU countries. The trends are pictured in Figures 12 to 14. The evidence points<lb/> towards a modest increase in concentration for most country groupings, except for CESEE. But the pick-up<lb/> in concentration has been reversed in the last year, 2012. For the EU as a whole, the C5 ratio increased<lb/> from 44% in 2008 to 46% in 2012 (6% increase) and the Herfindahl Index remained flat at 650.<lb/> Several countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Latvia, Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and Sweden)<lb/> show a decrease in concentration on both indicators. Three countries are above the hurdle of 2 000, beyond<lb/> which DG Competition of the European Commission gets worried about lack of competition. These<lb/> countries are Estonia at 2 500, the Netherlands at 2 000, and Finland at 3 600 (coming from 2 500 in<lb/> 2007). Germany showed a very large increase (61% on the Herfindahl Index), but is still the least<lb/> concentrated market in the EU.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Moving to the CESEE, we notice a decrease in concentration. This is due to the reduction of market<lb/> share by the Western banks, which dominate most of the CESEE markets (see reduction in cross-border<lb/> penetration in Table 3 and <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). This is an improvement for competition, as the CESEE had a very<lb/> concentrated market to start with. The Herfindahl Index for the full set of CESEE countries<lb/> decreased to 900, while for the subset of the <ref type="biblio">Baltics</ref> to 1 700.<lb/> Next, the peripheral countries show increased concentration. The Herfindahl Index for the peripheral<lb/> countries (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) increased from 1 000 to 1 200. This amounts to an average<lb/> increase of the Herfindahl Index of 20%. The wider group of distressed countries also shows an increase<lb/> from 500 to 650 (close to 30%).<lb/></figure>

			<head>6. Summary and Recommendations<lb/> Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper reviews the state of the European banking system. The 2008-9 global financial crisis and<lb/> subsequent 2010-12 sovereign debt crisis have left their mark on European banks. First, there is evidence<lb/> of deleveraging. While overall asset growth is more or less flat in the EU, country data show a strong trend<lb/> of deleveraging (-10 to -20% from 2008 to 2012) in the Baltics and the Periphery (Greece, Ireland and<lb/> Portugal). At the bank level, we observe a strong deleveraging (-23%) for banks that received state aid,<lb/> while non-state aid banks have grown their balance sheet (+4%). Second, cross-border flows have also<lb/> been reduced within the EU. In particular, the Baltics and wider group of CESEE countries show a decline<lb/> of 12 percentage points over the 2008-2012 period. Similarly, the Periphery has experienced a decline of<lb/> 9 percentage points. The withdrawal from crisis-stricken countries has contributed to the deleveraging in<lb/> these countries. It has also lead to a national reorientation within Europe. Third, we examine the capital<lb/> position with a view to the forthcoming asset quality review by the ECB. Our basic scenario of<lb/> recapitalising European banks to a market-based leverage ratio of 3% shows a capital shortage of<lb/> EUR 84 billion.<lb/> What is the impact on credit supply and competition? At the bank level, we find an impact on credit<lb/> supply. As expected, strongly capitalised banks (a market based leverage ratio of more than 4%) kept on<lb/> lending, while the medium and weakly capitalised banks show a decline. Furthermore, the price-to-book<lb/> ratio for the latter two groups of banks is below one. This indicates that the market perceives these banks<lb/> as weak and assigns them a low stock price. Our findings provide prima facie evidence of a credit crunch<lb/> in Europe. By contrast, the impact of the crises on competition is modest, with a small increase in banking<lb/> concentration in the distressed countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy).<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p>The main challenge of the Banking Union is to counter the fragmentation of the European banking<lb/> market. The new euro-area perspective should replace the emerging national tendencies. In that spirit, the<lb/> CESEE countries may exercise their option to join Banking Union at some point in the future, as their<lb/> financial system is much dependent on the Western-European banks, which are mostly covered by the<lb/></p>
