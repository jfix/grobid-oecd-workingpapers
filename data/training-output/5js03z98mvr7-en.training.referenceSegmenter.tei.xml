        priority
        <bibl>, or (ii) wrongly classifying a patent family as a claimed priority when in fact it is only a singleton (e.g.<lb/> consider a patent family consisting of EP and DE applications with DE as the only designated country).<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>12 Previously, one needed to determine whether a patent has been granted at each of the 38 member states<lb/> patent authorities, hence making sense of the 38 different publication kind code systems. Fortunately, this has<lb/> been much facilitated in recent editions of PATSTAT.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>13 Specifically, data for years prior to 1990 seem rather incomplete; therefore we only construct the propensities<lb/> for the period after 1990 (for Italy only after 2004). Even after 1990, data for some years and offices are missing,<lb/> with two different situations occurring: (1) A year count is missing (GR 2007, LT 2007) and years around seem<lb/> to be correct (the same trend before and after the missing year). In this case we simply impute a value for the<lb/> missing year corresponding to the mean of the year before and the year after. (2) A year count is missing (FR<lb/> 2007, IT 2007) and the years before and after show implausibly high numbers above the long-term trend. In this<lb/> case we assume that for an unknown reason the patents have been distributed among the years before and after<lb/> the missing year. ). In this case we re-allocate a third of the count proceeding the missing year, and a third of<lb/> count in the year following the missing year. Moreover, the total on which the propensities are calculated also<lb/> has to be corrected (the total for 2007 is very low compared with other years). The total is the count of distinct<lb/> applications among all countries (no double-counting for applications with protection in multiple states). We use<lb/> the &quot; duplicate protection &quot; coefficient observed in 2005 and 2009, take the mean of those two values, and divide<lb/> through the values re-allocated from 2006 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2007 to inflate the total for 2007.<lb/> 14 A similar approach was developed by De Rassenfosse et al. (2013).<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>15 Development of a suitable search strategy – that is, a mapping between patent classification systems and a<lb/> definition of &quot; environmental &quot; innovation -is a distinct problem and is not addressed here. A companion paper is<lb/> devoted to this issue.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>16 Starting 2013 the EPO and USPTO have started using a common classification system (CPC) and<lb/> consequently the use of ECLA and USPC is being discontinued.<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>18 The benefit of the new Y02 scheme is twofold. First, it allows identifying patent documents in technological<lb/> fields that would otherwise not be possible by a non-specialist! The tags were developed by patent examiners at<lb/> the EPO who are specialised in the different fields covered. Second, it provides a much greater level of detail<lb/> than what would be possible using the IPC. This is a significant advantage over previous searches based on the<lb/> IPC. See Veefkind et al. (2012) for further details.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>19 DOCDB, also referred to as EPODOC, is the EPO&apos;s master documentation database. This is the resource<lb/> used by patent examiners for searches of prior art.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>20 Personal communication by Mr. Victor Veefkind of the European Patent Office, 2012.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>21 In the ideal case, one would construct a different TOTPAT for each of the individual Y02 symbols –<lb/> depending on type of attributes used in the algorithm to assign a given symbol (e.g. some algorithms use<lb/> keywords, others do not). While such information could be made available, it is of limited practical use because<lb/> (i) analysis is rarely conducted at the level of an individual symbol (e.g. Y02E10:43 Fresnel lenses); rather, it is<lb/> the hierarchically more aggregated level (e.g. Y02E10:4 Solar thermal energy) that is of interest to decision-<lb/>makers. In such case it is not clear how can one generate a TOTPAT at the aggregate level when individual tags<lb/> use different sets of attributes; (ii) Even if the same set of attributes were used within a given &quot; field &quot; of<lb/> technology, analyses often compare several of such &quot; fields &quot; implying the use of multiple &quot; totals &quot; (e.g. a total for<lb/> solar energy, a total for wind energy, etc.).<lb/> </bibl>
