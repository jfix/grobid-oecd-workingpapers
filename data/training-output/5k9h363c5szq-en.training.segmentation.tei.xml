			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper looks at how the income distribution in countries changes when the value of publicly-provided <lb/>services to households is included. We consider five major categories of public services: education, health <lb/>care, social housing, childcare and elderly care. On average across OECD countries, spending on these &quot; in-<lb/>kind &quot; benefits accounts for about 13% of GDP, slightly more than the spending on cash transfers – but <lb/>with considerable cross-country variation. Broadening the income concept to account for in-kind benefits <lb/>considerably increases households &quot; economic resources: in a typical OECD country, the average annual <lb/>household income would be close to USD 28 000, rather than USD 22 000 in purchasing power parities. <lb/>But public services also contribute to reducing income inequality, by between one-fifth and one-third <lb/>depending on the inequality measure. Mexico and, according to most inequality measures, the United <lb/>States, Portugal, Ireland, and the United Kingdom record higher reduction rates, while Slovenia records <lb/>lower ones. Across all countries, redistributive effects are stronger among specific population groups at <lb/>higher risk of poverty. Between 2000 and 2007, the redistributive impact of public services remained stable <lb/>overall. However, the impact became stronger in countries where the share of services in household <lb/>income increased significantly, while it weakened in those countries where this share decreased. The paper <lb/>suggests that publicly provided services fulfil an important direct redistributive role in OECD countries. <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Ce document examine la façon dont la distribution des revenus varie dans les pays lorsque la valeur des <lb/>services publics fournis aux ménages est inclue. L&apos;imputation de la valeur de ces services dans les revenus <lb/>des ménages et l&apos;analyse de leur potentiel redistributif posent des défis méthodologiques importants, tels <lb/>que l &quot; estimation et l &quot; allocation de ces services aux bénéficiaires, ou l&apos;ajustement de l&apos;échelle d&apos;équivalence <lb/>aux besoins associés à ces services. Nous présentons des analyses de sensibilité, en utilisant deux <lb/>approches innovatrices mises en avant dans la littérature. Le document considère cinq grandes catégories <lb/>de services publics: éducation, santé, logement social, garde d&apos;enfants et soins aux personnes âgées. En <lb/>moyenne, dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, les dépenses relatives à ces prestations «en nature» s &quot; élèvent à environ <lb/>13% du PIB, soit légèrement plus que les dépenses relatives aux transferts en espèces-mais avec beaucoup <lb/>variations entre pays. Elargir le concept de revenu pour tenir compte des avantages « en nature » augmente <lb/>considérablement les ressources économiques des ménages: dans un pays typique de l&apos;OCDE, le revenu <lb/>annuel moyen des ménages serait proche de 28 000 USD, plutôt que 22 000 USD en parité de pouvoir <lb/>d &quot; achat. Mais les services publics contribuent également à réduire l&apos;inégalité de revenus, d &quot; un cinquième à <lb/>un tiers en fonction de la mesure d &quot; inégalité. Le Mexique et, selon la plupart des mesures d &quot; inégalités, les <lb/>États-Unis, le Portugal, l&apos;Irlande et le Royaume-Uni enregistrent des taux de réduction plus élevés, tandis <lb/>que la Slovénie enregistre des taux de réduction plus faibles. Dans tous les pays, les effets redistributifs <lb/>sont plus forts parmi les groupes de population spécifiques à risque de pauvreté plus élevé. Entre 2000 et <lb/>2007, l&apos;impact redistributif des services publics est resté globalement stable. Toutefois, l&apos;impact est devenu <lb/>plus fort dans les pays où la part des services dans les revenus des ménages a augmenté de manière <lb/>significative, alors qu&apos;il s &quot; est affaibli dans les pays où cette part a diminué. Le document suggère que les <lb/>services publics remplissent un rôle de redistribution directe important dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE. <lb/></body>

			<body>1. <lb/>INTRODUCTION <lb/>1. <lb/>The economic well-being of households is determined, to a large extent, by households &quot; <lb/>disposable cash income. Cash incomes, however, exclude a range of flows that affect a household &quot; s <lb/>consumption possibilities and their capacity to attend to their needs. These include services provided by <lb/>firms as well as other resources such as time and home production that contribute to households &quot; living <lb/>standards and their capacity to attend to their needs. Among the most important factors which are omitted <lb/>from the &quot; standard &quot; accounting framework are government activities that impact on household well-being <lb/>through the in-kind services they provide. <lb/>2. <lb/>Recently, the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress <lb/>led by Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi published its final report examining measures <lb/>of well-being (www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr). One of its recommendations is that household income should <lb/>reflect in-kind services provided by the government, such as subsidized health care and educational <lb/>services. <lb/>3. <lb/>In addition to influencing the overall economic well-being of households, publicly provided <lb/>services also impact on the distribution of resources across households and it can be expected that this <lb/>impact is not the same across countries. Recent years have therefore seen an increasing academic literature <lb/>on the distributive implications of publicly-provided services (see Marical et al. 2006 &amp; 2008, OECD, <lb/>2008a; Sutherland and Tsakloglou, 2009; Tsakloglou et al., 2009 and Vaalavuo, 2010). <lb/>4. <lb/>Most of the available comparative empirical evidence on levels and trends in income inequalities <lb/>and poverty in OECD countries relies on the concept of household disposable cash income, thus ignoring <lb/>the services governments provide to households. Including those services matters a lot, however, for policy <lb/>interpretation. 1 First, some countries rely more on in-kind benefits rather than cash transfers. When, for <lb/>instance, country A heavily subsidizes education, whereas country B primarily relies on private schools <lb/>funded by fees, this difference will not show up in traditional income distribution statistics, even though <lb/>the financial implications for the households in the two countries will differ considerably. Second, <lb/>households see their income reduced due to taxes, so it is important to account for the benefits of the <lb/>services that are funded through taxes <lb/>5. <lb/>The volume of publicly-provided services – health, education and family services as well as <lb/>social services for elderly, survivors, disabled persons, unemployed and those in respect of housing and <lb/>social assistance – varies considerably across countries (Figure 1). For the most recent available year, these <lb/>services constitute about 13% of GDP on average across the 34 OECD countries, ranging from close to 8% <lb/>in Turkey and Chile to 20% in Denmark and Sweden. On average, health care and education services <lb/>account for 5 to 6 percentage points each. The remaining 2% are made up mainly of care services for <lb/>children and the elderly; the latter are particularly important in the Nordic countries, Australia and Japan <lb/>where they exceed 1% of GDP. <lb/>1 <lb/>A growing number of government studies in OECD countries include the effect of services in their regular <lb/>reports on the distributional impact of policies. An example is the United Kingdom &quot; s Spending Review <lb/>carried out by HM treasury, see http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spend_sr2010_impact_households.htm <lb/></body>

			<body>6. <lb/>On OECD average, more spending goes to these services than to cash transfers which amount to <lb/>11% of GDP on average. This is because in some countries, the relative share of services is considerably <lb/>higher. This is particularly the case in Mexico, Korea, Iceland, Canada and the United States. By contrast, <lb/>services play a less important role than cash transfers in many EU countries, and particularly so in Austria, <lb/>Italy and Poland. <lb/>Figure 1. Public expenditure for in-kind and cash transfers, in percentage of GDP, 2007 <lb/>Note: Countries are ranked in increasing order of total expenditure on all social services. Data on education services for Greece, <lb/>Luxembourg and Turkey refer to 2005. <lb/>(a) Other social services include services to survivors, disabled persons, unemployed, as well as those in respect of housing and <lb/>social assistance (estimates of social housing are, however, not included). <lb/>(b) Cash transfers to the elderly, survivors, disabled persons, families, unemployed, as well as those in respect of social assistance. <lb/>Source: OECD Social Expenditure database, OECD Education database, OECD Health database. <lb/>7. <lb/>How does inequality change once publicly-provided services are taken into account? In a first <lb/>analysis OECD (2008a) found that education, health care and social housing significantly lowered income <lb/>inequality was on measures for a year around 2000 in 17 OECD countries (about one quarter on average). <lb/>But public services typically reduced inequality by less than cash transfers were able to do, which amounts <lb/>to a reduction of about one third. Another finding was that differences between countries in inequality were <lb/>somewhat lower once public services are taken into account than when comparing only cash incomes. <lb/>These results highlighted the importance of taking account of this redistributive impact when making <lb/>policy choices about these programmes. <lb/>8. <lb/>The present study goes beyond these preliminary analyses in several ways. First, it includes ten <lb/>additional OECD countries and up-dates the estimates to the late 2000s, thus revealing changes in the <lb/>distributive impact of services since the early 2000s. Second, it considers additional public services, in <lb/>particular care for children and the elderly and the distributive impact of specific policies on specific <lb/>groups of the population. Third, it analyses also the effects on low-income households and poverty <lb/>specifically. Finally, the chapter also reports some estimates based on alternative and recently developed <lb/>methods to impute services into household income. <lb/>9. <lb/>Considering the influence of government services on the distribution of household income <lb/>requires broadening the definition of household income, from the more narrow concept of disposable <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>Family services <lb/>Services to the elderly <lb/>Other social services (a) <lb/>Health services <lb/>Education services <lb/>Cash transfers (b) <lb/></body>

			<body>income – i.e. the sum of market income (earnings, rents, dividends, etc.) and cash transfers (from both <lb/>public and private sources) less direct taxes and social security contributions paid by households – to one <lb/>that includes additional non-market elements, such as government-provided services, home production 2 <lb/>and other components that are usually omitted from conventional statistics. Incorporating the value of <lb/>government services in household income raises a range of questions, some of which are conceptual, and <lb/>others are methodological (see e.g. Marical et al. 2006; Garfinkel et al. 2006; OECD 2008a; Aaberge et al. <lb/>2010a; Paulus et al., 2010), in particular: <lb/>a) Which of the government services should be included for the analysis of the impact on poverty? <lb/>b) How to value public services? <lb/>c) How to allocate the value of government services among individuals and households? <lb/>d) Can the same equivalence scale be used for cash and non-cash incomes, or does the inclusion of <lb/>non-cash incomes require a different approach? <lb/>10. <lb/>Chapter 2 below considers question a) and provides a definition and overview of public services <lb/>to households and its characteristics. Apart from the three services that have been traditionally considered <lb/>when including in-kind benefits (namely education, health care and social housing), also three other <lb/>categories are discussed, i.e. services for early childhood education and childcare, long-term elderly care <lb/>services, and subsidies for public transport and public utilities 3 . <lb/>11. <lb/>Chapter 3 discusses the remaining three of the above questions, questions b) through d). <lb/>Compared to OECD (2008a) a more refined methodology is presented for estimating the value of social <lb/>housing for its beneficiaries. Also, valuation and allocation methods for early childhood education and <lb/>childcare services and long-term elderly care services are proposed. Further, this chapter addresses <lb/>methodological and conceptual issues in choosing an appropriate equivalence scale for in-kind benefits. <lb/>The use of the &quot; traditional &quot; cash income equivalence scale is compared with that of two innovative <lb/>approaches that have recently been developed in the literature to account for the differences in needs <lb/>between cash and in-kind income. Chapter 3 also proposes an alternative indicator for capturing the <lb/>possible poverty impact of public services. <lb/>12. <lb/>On the basis of these methodological choices, Chapter 4 presents the empirical results for the <lb/>distributive effects of services, based on micro data from EU-SILC, LIS and HILDA, as well as other <lb/>available OECD and EU data. Chapter 5 concludes. <lb/>2 <lb/>The value of home production is not considered in this paper, neither the value of in-kind benefits from <lb/>private sources. A recent discussion of the value of home production based on time use surveys can be <lb/>found in Miranda (2011). <lb/></body>

			<body>2. <lb/>OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL PUBLIC SERVICES: DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE <lb/>13. <lb/>The focus here is on public social expenditures <lb/>4 , which are social spending flows controlled by <lb/>General Government (i.e. different levels of government and social security funds), thus excluding pure <lb/>public goods, like national defence and justice <lb/>5 . Hence, it involves only those expenditures that can be <lb/>attributed to an individual beneficiary and that are excludable. Public education and health care <lb/>expenditures are by far the two major categories of this kind of expenditures, as illustrated in Figure 1. <lb/>14. <lb/>In all OECD countries except Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Korea, Mexico and Turkey, public health <lb/>care services form the most important category of public services to households (see Figure 1). On <lb/>average, public spending on health care services amounts to around 6% of GDP, constituting the largest <lb/>part of total health spending of around 9% of GDP (OECD Health Data). Total health spending is by far <lb/>highest in the United States, with more than half accounted for by private health spending. Among <lb/>European countries, France, Germany, Austria and Belgium are the countries with the highest levels of <lb/>overall spending on health care (in excess of 10%), whereas Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic spend <lb/>the least (below 7%). Differences across countries are also substantial when only public expenditures are <lb/>considered, ranging from 2.6% (Mexico) to almost 8% (Germany and France). <lb/>15. <lb/>Public investment in education is also considerable. The highest education expenditures of more <lb/>than 6% of GDP are found in the Nordic countries and in Belgium. Lower levels are found in the Slovak <lb/>Republic, Japan and Luxembourg 6 . In all countries, primary to below-tertiary education make up by far the <lb/>largest share of public education expenditures (OECD 2010), while tertiary education accounts for more <lb/>than 1% in most countries. <lb/>16. <lb/>While cash housing benefits are generally included in household disposable income, the effect of <lb/>social housing is not accounted for. This may provide a misleading picture of the impact of overall housing <lb/>policies on inequality and poverty, as some countries use different policies to help households meet their <lb/>housing expenses (Gardiner et al., 1995; Whitehead and Scanlon 2007). Unfortunately, no internationally <lb/>comparative estimates of the relative level of social housing as a share of GDP are available. The scale of <lb/>social housing and the conditions of access vary considerably across countries, with relatively high shares <lb/>(almost 20% of total housing) in countries like the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France <lb/>and the Netherlands (CECODHAS, http://www.cecodhas.org/; Whitehead and Scanlon, 2007). Also <lb/>conditions of access to social housing vary considerably from one country to another. In the Netherlands <lb/>and Sweden, access to social housing is not explicitly linked to individuals &quot; resources, while Belgium and <lb/>Germany, for example, means-test access to social housing (Andrews et al., 2011). <lb/>17. <lb/>Services to families refer largely to Early Childhood Education and Childcare (ECEC). Access <lb/>to affordable childcare is one of the key elements of strategies to reconcile work and family life, promote <lb/>4 <lb/>Social expenditure are defined as &quot; the provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and <lb/>financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during <lb/>circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial <lb/>contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract <lb/>or transfer. &quot; (Adema &amp; Ladaique, 2009) <lb/>5 <lb/>Though part of these expenditures may have an explicit social aim and can be attributed to a specific <lb/>individual beneficiary, as for instance in the case of free legal support. <lb/>6 <lb/>The spending level in Luxembourg does not include tertiary education. <lb/></body>

			<body>equal opportunities and combat social exclusion (Matsaganis and Verbist 2009; OECD 2011a). Limited <lb/>and unequal access to childcare services perpetuates social inequalities, whereas investment in early <lb/>education can protect children from further social disadvantages and contribute to more equality. With 1% <lb/>or more of GDP, these services are important in all Nordic countries, as well as in France, Hungary and the <lb/>United Kingdom (see Figure 1). Pre-primary education is a more important category than childcare in most <lb/>countries (OECD, Family Database). In countries with high enrolment rates in formal care for under 3 year <lb/>old, public spending on childcare is accordingly high. This is notably the case in the Nordic countries, <lb/>France and the United Kingdom. <lb/>18. <lb/>Elderly care has emerged as a major social policy concern in OECD countries more recently <lb/>(Österle 2002; OECD 2005b and 2011b; Da Roit et al. 2007; European Commission 2006; Pavolini and <lb/>Ranci 2008). The proportion of GDP spent on long-term care is estimated to at least double and possibly <lb/>triple by 2050 (OECD 2005b; Comas-Herrera et al. 2006). More than two thirds of the people aged over 70 <lb/>years are expected to need help in performing at least one or two daily routines (Eurofound 2006; WHO <lb/>2008). Public expenditures on services for the elderly vary between 0.1 per cent of GDP in Estonia and 2.5 <lb/>per cent in the Netherlands (Huber et al. 2009). The variation in expenditure levels is substantially greater <lb/>than for other public spending, such as health care (see also Jensen 2008). According to estimates by the <lb/>European Union (EC 2006), public spending on long-term care will increase by around 1 percentage point <lb/>between 2004 and 2050 in most member states, and by over 2 percentage points in Finland, Sweden and <lb/>Slovenia due to their more developed formal care system. <lb/>Box 1. Other services: public transport subsidies and public utilities <lb/>Apart from the public social services discussed above, other policy domains of public services have a specific <lb/>social aim, as they involve interpersonal redistribution and may affect the standard of living of households and <lb/>individuals. Major examples are subsidies for public transportation, as well as support for energy costs and other <lb/>utilities. Note that these services are not included in Figure 1, as national estimates for these categories are rare. <lb/>Subsidies on public transport basically have an economic efficiency rationale (Parry &amp; Small, 2009). This <lb/>means that economies of scale imply that the marginal cost of supplying mobility is less than the average cost. <lb/>Moreover, by stimulating the use of public transport private car use and related negative externalities may be <lb/>reduced. But apart from this efficiency rationale, social arguments play a role, namely that these subsidies intend to <lb/>make mobility more affordable, especially to low-income groups. <lb/>Most research on the effect of public transport subsidies has focused on the economic efficiency reasons, <lb/>thereby largely ignoring distributive aspects. These aspects can be direct, by reducing the financial cost of mobility or <lb/>indirect, by increasing the labour market opportunities of the beneficiaries. Most of existing research is on urban <lb/>public transport. A number of studies investigate the pro-poorness of public transport subsidies. These studies deal <lb/>in general with a confined geographical area, such as large cities. Recent research includes Asensio et al. (2003), <lb/>Carruthers, Dick and Saurkar (2005) and Estupiñán et al. (2007). Fearnley (2006) and Jones (2008) are among the <lb/>rare studies that provide national estimates, both for the United Kingdom. They find that public transport subsidies <lb/>appear to make the poorest better off, though there is variation by mode of transportation (e.g. bus travel subsidies <lb/>turned out be more pro-poor than those for rail transport) as well as by geographical location. <lb/>Apart from public transport, also utilities like energy and communication services are provided by the <lb/>government to the public at below-market prices, or entail provisions for low-income or other target groups. Nolan <lb/>and Russel (2001) for instance investigate the distributive effect of the so-called &quot; free schemes &quot; (for electricity/gas, <lb/>TV license, telephone rental, and free travel) and the Medical Card in Ireland and find that these free schemes are <lb/>more beneficial to the lower income groups, hence reducing inequality and relative poverty (the latter by about one <lb/>fifth). The possible redistributive impact of benefits that are associated specifically with energy provisions is likely to <lb/>become an important policy issue in the future, given the importance of climate change and evolutions of energy <lb/>prices. Many national programmes to subsidise energy use have broadly two aims: first aim, to ensure affordable <lb/>energy (electricity, gas, fuel) for low-income and other vulnerable groups; second, and more recently, to stimulate the <lb/>use of renewable energy sources. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. <lb/>HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR PUBLICLY PROVIDED SERVICES IN HOUSEHOLD <lb/>INCOME: CONCEPTUAL ISSUES AND METHODOLOGY <lb/>19. <lb/>Including publicly-provided services in the analysis of inequality raises a number of conceptual <lb/>and methodological issues, since the value of government services needs to be incorporated into individual <lb/>household incomes and &quot; extended income &quot; needs to be estimated. The first section of this chapter briefly <lb/>presents the data used for the empirical analysis in this project. In the second section, the issue of how to <lb/>value and allocate publicly provided services is addressed in general terms. The subsequent sections <lb/>describe which methods have been applied to value and allocate services for the five major categories: <lb/>education, health care, social housing, early childhood education and long-term elderly care services, <lb/>respectively. A separate section is devoted to the complex issue of adjusting the equivalence scale for the <lb/>needs associated with public services and presents two recently published innovative methodologies. The <lb/>final section presents and discusses the indicators for estimating the poverty alleviation of public services, <lb/>including an alternative indicator which looks at the poverty reduction potential of services. <lb/>3.1 Data <lb/>20. <lb/>The empirical analyses in this project are carried out on 2007 micro data from the European <lb/>Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) which is available for 24 EU countries as well <lb/>as for Iceland and Norway. The income reference period is 2006. For Australia, the 2007 wave of <lb/>Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) was used, and calculations for Canada, <lb/>Mexico and the United States are performed using data from the Luxembourg Income Study, referring to <lb/>the income year 2004. <lb/>21. <lb/>Estimates of the value of public services are derived from various sources, in particular the <lb/>OECD Social Expenditure Database (www.oecd.org/els/social/expenditure). For education, the OECD <lb/>Education Online Database was used. For health care, age profiles available from the European <lb/>Commission and the Economic Policy Committee (2009) and from OECD (2006) were used. For social <lb/>housing, the monetary benefit that stems from free or reduced rent housing was estimated by applying <lb/>regression analyses on the micro data of EU-SILC. For child and elderly care, data come from various <lb/>national sources, which are described in the Annex 2. <lb/>3.2 How to value public services and allocate those to individuals and households? <lb/>22. <lb/>The standard way to estimate the monetary value of public services is to use a production cost <lb/>approach (see Aaberge and Langørgen, 2006; Marical et al., 2008; Smeeding et al., 1993). This means that <lb/>the transfer to the beneficiaries is assumed to equal the average cost of providing or producing these public <lb/>services. In other words, one USD spent on services in assumed to equal one USD worth to households or <lb/>individuals. It is important to note that this approach neglects differences within and across countries in the <lb/>quality and efficiency in the provision of these services. Moreover, this approach does not necessarily <lb/>reflect the user &quot; s value of the service, as the public service cannot (easily) be exchanged for other goods. <lb/>For all the services studied in this paper, the production cost is used, with the exception of social housing, <lb/>where the value of the benefit is derived from prevailing market rents. <lb/>23. <lb/>A second issue is how to allocate these benefits across the population. In the literature two <lb/>approaches have been distinguished, namely the &quot; actual consumption approach &quot; and the &quot; insurance value <lb/>approach &quot; (see e.g. Marical et al., 2008). The actual consumption approach allocates the value of public <lb/>services to the individuals that are actually using the service. For most services, the actual consumption <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2011)15 <lb/></note>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>approach will be the most appropriate, if actual beneficiaries can be identified. In some cases an insurance <lb/>value approach may be applicable or even preferable. Such an approach imputes the &quot; insurance value &quot; of <lb/>coverage to each person based on specific characteristics (such as age, sex, socio-economic position). For <lb/>instance, in much of the literature the actual consumption approach is considered to be less appropriate in <lb/>the case of health care, as it ignores the greater needs that are associated with being ill. Hence, the <lb/>insurance value approach is preferred. Table 1 summarises which of the two approaches are proposed for <lb/>nine different service categories, and which have been used for the five services in this study. <lb/>Table 1. Summary of allocation methods for different public services <lb/>Public service <lb/>Allocation <lb/>method <lb/>Beneficiaries <lb/>Education <lb/>AC <lb/>Pupils and students <lb/>Health care <lb/>IV <lb/>All individuals covered by public health <lb/>Social housing <lb/>AC <lb/>Residents of social housing unit <lb/>Early childhood education and care <lb/>AC <lb/>Young children in public childcare and pre-<lb/>primary education <lb/>Long-term elderly care <lb/>IV <lb/>All elderly people covered by the system <lb/>Incapacity-related <lb/>AC <lb/>Individuals that suffer from incapacity and use <lb/>related publicly provided services <lb/>Active labour market programmes <lb/>(ALM) <lb/>AC <lb/>Individuals participating in ALM programmes <lb/>Public transport <lb/>AC <lb/>Passengers of public transport <lb/>Public utilities, e.g. energy, <lb/>communication <lb/>AC <lb/>Users of public utilities <lb/>Note: AC = Actual consumption; IV = insurance value. <lb/>3.3 The allocation of education services: actual use approach <lb/>24. <lb/>The standard method in the literature to include benefits that households derive from education <lb/>services is the actual use approach (see e.g. Antoninis and Tsakloglou, 2001; Garfinkel et al., 2006; Callan <lb/>et al., 2008). This means that the beneficiaries of education are the pupils and students that are currently <lb/>using these services. Actual participation is largely determined by age, but also by other factors, such as <lb/>individuals &quot; social background and income. In principle, all individuals of compulsory school age benefit <lb/>from education, which makes the approach to allocate public expenditure based on age for this group a <lb/>priori justifiable 7 . Social background plays a more important role for participation in other education <lb/>levels, such as pre-primary education and tertiary education; hence, actual participation should be <lb/>considered. Enrolment rates are almost universal for children aged 5 to 14 and relatively high for <lb/>individuals aged 15 to 19: the average in the OECD is 82% with lower rates in e.g. Turkey (46%) and <lb/>Mexico (52%) and higher rates in Belgium (92%), Poland (93%) and Slovenia (91%). For the older groups <lb/>7 <lb/>The starting age of compulsory education is 6 in most countries, whereas some countries start earlier at age <lb/>5 (Hungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), and others at age 7 <lb/>(Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Poland and Sweden) (see OECD 2010). Ending age of compulsory education <lb/>varies between 14 and 18 years. 90% of the population are enrolled in education for at least 13 years, <lb/>ranging from 11 (e.g. Greece) to 15 years (Belgium, France, Norway and Sweden). A small minority of <lb/>children (often from disadvantaged background) do not attend school at this age. According to OECD <lb/>(2008b), 1.5% of children aged between 5 and 14 are not enrolled in school, on average across OECD <lb/>countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>(20 to 29 year old), enrolment rates are much lower, ranging from less than 10% in Luxembourg (where <lb/>most higher education students study abroad) to 43% in Finland. <lb/>25. <lb/>Information on actual participation in different types of education is in general available in the <lb/>databases used for individuals aged 16 or older. For younger individuals, age is used to determine <lb/>participation 8 . No distinction could be made in the surveys between participation in publicly or privately <lb/>funded education institutions 9 , nor between general and technical secondary education, nor between Type <lb/>A and Type B tertiary education 10 ; hence, these breakdowns could not be applied either. The breakdown <lb/>applied in this paper refers to the revised International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED-97): <lb/>pre-primary 11 , primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary <lb/>education. <lb/>26. <lb/>Each pupil or student that participates in a publicly funded education institution is assigned a <lb/>public education transfer that equals the cost of producing these services in the corresponding level of <lb/>education, according to National Accounts data. Public educational expenditure refers to total direct <lb/>government expenditures for educational institutions per education level, converted to a &apos;per student&apos; basis <lb/>through data on the number of students in each level. These data are obtained from the OECD Education <lb/>Database for OECD countries, which distinguishes per student expenditures for pre-primary, primary, <lb/>lower-secondary, upper-secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education. For tertiary <lb/>education, direct expenditures for research and development activities are excluded, as they do not have <lb/>education as their primary aim (even though there are of course indirect benefits from R&amp;D towards <lb/>students). All education expenditure amounts are imputed to the identified beneficiaries and then added to <lb/>the income of the households where they live, by average public spending per student at the relevant <lb/>educational level. <lb/>3.4 The allocation of health care services: insurance-value approach <lb/>27. <lb/>Health care is one of the largest government expenditure items. In order to estimate the <lb/>distributive effects of public health care services in this study, household incomes are increased by the <lb/>imputed monetary value of public health care services. Two main approaches can be distinguished to <lb/>attribute to individuals the benefits from public health care services and have been applied empirically, <lb/>namely the actual consumption approach on the one hand and the insurance-value approach on the other. <lb/>28. <lb/>Studies that use the actual consumption approach base their analyses on detailed data on the <lb/>effective use of health care services by individuals (see e.g. Evandrou et al. (1993) and Sefton (2002) for <lb/>the UK); they concluded that public health care expenditures lower income inequality. This approach is, <lb/>however, only feasible if information is available on the actual use of health care services, which is often <lb/>8 <lb/>The probability of participating in a specific education level is derived from net enrolment rates by single <lb/>year of age presented in Education at a Glance. Information on actual use of pre-primary education is used <lb/>when available in the survey. <lb/>9 <lb/>Enrolment in private schools may lead to an underestimation of the poverty impact of public education <lb/>services if these students are mainly from better-off families and if public subsidies to private schools are <lb/>lower than the costs of public schools. <lb/>10 <lb/>Tertiary-type A programmes (ISCED 5A) are largely theory-based and are designed to provide sufficient <lb/>qualifications for entry to advanced research programmes and professions with high skill requirements, <lb/>such as medicine, dentistry or architecture. Tertiary-type B programmes (ISCED 5B) are typically shorter <lb/>than those of tertiary-type A and focus on practical, technical or occupational skills for direct entry into the <lb/>labour market. <lb/></body>

			<body>lacking in income surveys. In addition, a fundamental critique often raised against the actual use approach <lb/>is that it ignores the greater needs that are associated with being ill, in the absence of an equivalence scale <lb/>that adjusts for health status (see e.g. Aaberge et al., 2006). The actual consumption approach implies that <lb/>sick people are ceteris paribus better off than healthy people because they receive more health care <lb/>services. Moreover, research has indicated that poorer people have in general worse health conditions, and <lb/>consequently greater needs for health care (see e.g. Hernández-Quevedo et al., 2006). <lb/>29. <lb/>As an alternative, the insurance-value approach is the most frequently used analytical method and <lb/>imputes the &quot; insurance value &quot; of coverage to each person based on specific characteristics (such as age, <lb/>sex, socio-economic position). 12 The insurance value is the amount that an insured person would have to <lb/>pay in each category (e.g. age group) so that the third-party provider (government, employer, other insurer) <lb/>would have just enough revenue to cover all claims for such persons (see Smeeding, 1982). It is based on <lb/>the notion that what the government provides is equivalent to funding an insurance policy where the value <lb/>of the premium is the same for everybody sharing the same characteristics, such as age (Marical et al., <lb/>2006). Most studies which use the insurance-value approach impute public health care expenditures on the <lb/>basis of people &quot; s age; they report a significant decrease in inequality. <lb/>30. <lb/>These two alternative approaches can lead to different results. OECD (2008a) applies both the <lb/>insurance-value and the actual consumption approach for health expenditures to eight European countries. <lb/>On average, the distributive effect of health care expenditures turned out to be considerably lower using the <lb/>actual consumption approach than using the insurance-value approach. <lb/>31. <lb/>However, as argued in Smeeding et al. 2008, also the insurance value approach should take <lb/>account of differences in health care needs as the specific characteristics on which the insurance value is <lb/>based also relate to difference in needs. Hence, the authors advise to use the insurance-value approach <lb/>combined with the introduction of an equivalence scale that incorporates health care needs. From a <lb/>theoretical point of view this approach is the most appropriate, as different equivalence scales should be <lb/>used in the distribution of disposable income on the one hand and of disposable income plus the value of <lb/>health care services on the other. The logic behind this distinction is that the relative needs of individuals <lb/>belonging to particular groups are probably different for public health care services and for other <lb/>commodities paid out of cash income. Practical implementation of this approach, however, has so far not <lb/>been possible due to the absence of a set of equivalence scales that covers the entire population 13 . As the <lb/>issue of equivalence scales is crucial when studying the incorporation of services in distributive analyses, it <lb/>is discussed in more detail in section 3.8. <lb/>32. <lb/>As the datasets contain no information on use of health care services, the actual consumption <lb/>approach cannot be applied here. Consequently, this study applies the insurance-value approach for health <lb/>care services, which means that every individual is assumed to receive a public benefit determined by the <lb/>average spending on his/her group, irrespective of whether actual use of health care services was made. <lb/>The groups are determined by age and gender. Health expenditures per age group as a percentage of GDP <lb/>per capita – so called &quot; age profiles &quot; -are available from the European Commission and the Economic <lb/>Policy Committee (2009) for the EU countries and Norway, and from the OECD expenditure projections <lb/>for health and long-term care for Australia, Canada, Iceland, Mexico and the United States (OECD, 2006). <lb/>Multiplying these percentages with GDP per capita of the corresponding year provides an estimate of the <lb/>12 <lb/>For instance, this approach was also followed most recently by INSEE for estimating the redistributive <lb/>impact of in-kind services on the basis of National Accounts data (INSEE 2009). <lb/></body>

A method to take account of the income value households <lb/>14 <lb/>As only differences in age and gender are considered, this approach underestimates the equalising and <lb/>poverty-reducing effect of public health care services in countries where these are targeted to low-income <lb/>households (e.g. Medicaid in the United States). Even in health care systems with broad or universal <lb/>coverage, some elements are targeted towards low-income groups (e.g. reduced out-of-pocket payments for <lb/>hospitalisation, doctor visits etc.) and these are not accounted for in this type of imputation. <lb/>15 <lb/>It is common belief that health care costs rise steeply with age, because individuals are nearing their death, <lb/>making medical treatments more costly. Busse et al. (2002) conclude however that the relation between <lb/>health care costs and age is more complex. When hospital costs are considered, the most costly patients are <lb/>those who die young. <lb/>16 <lb/>As age is top-coded in EU-SILC at 80, the imputations undertaken in this report use the weighted average <lb/>for individuals aged 80 and over. <lb/>17 <lb/>The invaluable support of Joachim Frick and Markus Grabka (DIW – Berlin) for estimating imputed rent <lb/>for social renters is gratefully acknowledged. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>DEU Men <lb/>DEU Women <lb/>NLD Men <lb/>NLD Women <lb/>SWE Men <lb/>SWE Women <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>CZE Men <lb/>CZE Women <lb/>ITA Men <lb/>ITA Women <lb/>POL Men <lb/>POL Women <lb/></body>

			<body>derive from living in a publicly-provided house at lower rent, is to estimate the value of imputed rent. Due <lb/>to data availability, the effect of social housing is confined to countries in the EU-SILC database. <lb/>35. <lb/>Three groups of potential beneficiaries of imputed rent can be identified: owner-occupiers, rent-<lb/>free tenants and tenants with below-market rent (including social housing and rent-reduction by employers <lb/>or relatives). Most work on imputed rent until now has focused on estimating the benefits owner occupiers <lb/>derive from their owning the house (e.g. Canberra Group 2001; Frick &amp; Grabka 2003) Analogously, a <lb/>measure of imputed rent can be derived for tenants who rent in the public sector at a below-market rent. <lb/>However, very little conceptual and empirical work has been done on that issue so far. <lb/>36. <lb/>Reduced rent tenants can include those (a) renting social housing, (b) renting at a reduced rate <lb/>from an employer and (c) those in accommodation where the actual rent is fixed by law. No differentiation <lb/>between these three types is possible on the basis of the data at hand, which may lead to an overestimation. <lb/>When the term &quot; social renter &quot; is used in the following, this refers to this category of reduced rent tenants. <lb/>37. <lb/>A general description of the various approaches to calculate imputed rent on the basis of micro <lb/>data can be found in Frick and Grabka (2003), Frick et al. (2006) and Frick et al. (2010). In the current <lb/>paper the opportunity cost approach is used (also known as the &quot; rental equivalence method &quot; ). Using <lb/>information from those households living in the private (non-subsidized) rental market, a rental value for <lb/>all property of tenants in the social rental sector is estimated. It is based on a hedonic regression estimation <lb/>of the logarithm of rent actually paid by main tenants on the private housing market (so excluding social <lb/>housing and any other reduced rent payments) (covariates of the regression can be found in Table A.1 in <lb/>Annex 1). <lb/></body>

			<body>Table 2: Method used to estimate imputed rent for social renters and frequency of different categories of <lb/>tenure status (households) <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from EU-SILC 2007. <lb/>38. <lb/>Selection bias may occur between private and reduced rent tenants, resulting from e.g. different <lb/>quality of housing between private and social renters. The selection bias is supposed to run along the <lb/>criteria for eligibility and other factors like social segregation. The selection variables used are household <lb/>income, the capacity to face unexpected financial expenses, size of the family, whether or not the family is <lb/>a lone parent (all of which can be considered as indicators for the eligibility criteria) and whether or not the <lb/>head of household has a migration background as an indicator for possible segregation. If there is selection <lb/>bias, then a two-step Heckman procedure is applied to predict the logarithm of rent. <lb/>39. <lb/>Table 2 provides an overview of the number of cases of both private and social renters, as well as <lb/>which method is used in each country. In ten countries selection bias between private and social renters is <lb/>significant, and hence a Heckman selection bias correction is applied. In the other countries estimates are <lb/>derived using an OLS regression. No estimates are possible for Denmark and the Netherlands, as social <lb/>renters cannot be identified. <lb/>40. <lb/>Next, a randomly chosen error term from the true distribution of market renters is added in order <lb/>to maintain variation in the resulting estimates of imputed rent for reduced rent tenants. This is done five <lb/>times, and hence, five different estimates of rent for reduced rent tenants are derived in order to test for the <lb/>quality of the estimation.

			<body>amount of imputed rent for each country, as well as the share of social rent households with negative <lb/>imputed rent. Negative values may arise because of overlapping distribution of social and private renters, <lb/>e.g. because the geographical categorisation used in the regression is too rough. The table shows rather <lb/>high levels of imputed rent for the United Kingdom and Ireland. These high levels may be driven by rent <lb/>levels in London and Dublin. Finally, annual amounts are arrived at by multiplying the estimates by 12 and <lb/>negative values of imputed rent are put to zero. <lb/>3.6 Early childhood education and childcare services (ECEC): actual use approach <lb/>41. <lb/>To account for early childhood education and childcare services is the actual use approach, has <lb/>been applied, following Matsaganis and Verbist (2009). Formal care services for children below <lb/>compulsory school age can be categorized in three broad groups: 1) Centre-based day care; 2) Family day <lb/>care; 3) Pre-school education programmes (for more details, see OECD Family Database). As categories of <lb/>pre-primary education and childcare are overlapping in OECD and national data, and in some countries <lb/>there is no distinction between the two, pre-primary education is here taken into account together with <lb/>childcare in order to avoid the double counting of children using these services. It also gives a more <lb/>comparable image of services provided to children under school-age. While almost the entire age group of <lb/>3 to 6 years-olds is often enrolled in pre-primary school, services provided to younger children (under 3 <lb/>years old) are scarcer and opening hours are limited in many countries. <lb/>42. <lb/>The beneficiaries of publicly funded ECEC services are the children and their parents that are <lb/>using these services. The value of this type of public service can thus be allocated to the child or to its <lb/>parents. If the value of the in-kind benefit is added to household income and distributed evenly over <lb/>household members, then both allocations (to parents or to children) are equivalent. If the value is, <lb/>however, only allocated to the beneficiary, then the choice between parents and child may affect <lb/>distributional results. <lb/>43. <lb/>For an appropriate identification of beneficiaries, information on whether the user is benefiting <lb/>from subsidized care is needed, as well as on the type of childcare that is used (this is relevant in the case <lb/>where different categories are subsidised in a different way, which is in general the case), and on the <lb/>intensity of use (number of hours, or full-time or part-time). The differentiation between public and private <lb/>services is not available in the datasets used here. Consequently, in some cases public money is allocated to <lb/>people purchasing a private service. This does not introduce much bias in most countries, as private <lb/>services are rare or almost entirely subsidized by the state. But in some countries like the United Kingdom <lb/>and France, where many parents pay for private childcare and are partly reimbursed through the tax <lb/>system, this might lead to double counting of the benefits. <lb/>44. <lb/>Amounts per user of pre-primary education are derived from the OECD Education Database, <lb/>whereas the amounts for childcare come from various national sources (Vaalavuo 2011, see Annex 2) 18 . <lb/>An hourly price is derived by dividing this benefit by average hours of use. The imputation of ECEC <lb/>transfers is based on the real use of these services by an hourly basis in order to allow for differences in the <lb/>intensity of use. Pre-primary education is free in all countries studied but in kindergartens, crèches and <lb/>other forms of day care, there are often user fees that are tied to parent &quot; s income; these payments are not <lb/>taken into account in the imputation. As fees are income dependent in almost all OECD countries (see <lb/>OECD 2007), this means that the results probably underestimate the distributive effect of ECEC subsidies. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.7 Long-term elderly care services: insurance-value approach <lb/>45. <lb/>In comparison to childcare, no similar data on the use of elderly care services exists in the <lb/>datasets. Therefore, imputation is based on the insurance value approach as in the case of health care. If <lb/>elderly care is subsidised and access to subsidised facilities is universal, then one can impute the value of <lb/>elderly care services to the elderly, irrespective of whether they are actually using the service or not. These <lb/>expenditures per age group can be considered as a kind of insurance premium by which one is insured for <lb/>the care costs (either in the form of home-help or in an institution) one might incur with increasing age. <lb/>46. <lb/>In-kind benefits for elderly people fall into two broad categories: first, home-help services, e.g. <lb/>providing assistance to elderly living outside residential care centres for carrying out their daily tasks, and <lb/>second, day care services (provision of residential care in an institution, costs of operating homes for the <lb/>elderly, service flats, sheltered homes, etc). This second category can include both nursing homes, which <lb/>provide nursing and personal care to persons that face restrictions in their activities of daily living, as well <lb/>as institutions that are not designed specifically for people with extra care needs. <lb/>47. <lb/>Extensive international comparative research on elderly care has been scarce for many reasons: <lb/>designs of systems and administrative auspices are complex and vary remarkably, division between public <lb/>and private responsibilities is unclear, and analytical frameworks lack reliability and consistency (Österle <lb/>2002). 19 In addition to differences in expenditure levels, a great deal of variation can be found between <lb/>countries in the use of elderly care services. It is difficult to make perfect comparisons between the figures <lb/>shown in Table 3 as the age groups are not identical, but bearing this in mind we can see remarkable <lb/>differences in coverage: in Norway, for instance, 62 per cent of the oldest age group (85+) are using home <lb/>care services while the same figure is 7 per cent in Estonia (80+). The use of institutional care varies from <lb/>4 per cent in Estonia and 8 per cent in Spain to 34 per cent in Denmark and 40 per cent in Iceland <lb/>(Vaalavuo, 2011). <lb/>19 <lb/>Moreover, variance can be found in following areas: branch covering the risk of dependence (healthcare, <lb/>sickness, invalidity, or long-term care), system of coverage (social insurance or social assistance), <lb/>conditions for which benefits are granted, qualifying period, means testing, age groups covered, minimum <lb/>level of dependency, user charges for benefits in kind, level of benefits in cash, and needs-testing according <lb/>to the level of dependency (MISSOC 2009). <lb/></body>

In Iceland <lb/>and Slovenia, home care services and in Italy, both home and institutional care are calculated for the total age group of 65+. c.) Age <lb/>groups: Denmark and Norway 67-74, 75-84, 85+; Hungary 65-69, 70-79, 80+; Estonia and Spain 65-79, 80+; France and Slovenia <lb/>65-74, 75-79, 80+; the UK 65-74, 75+. d.)Data is from mid-2000s. <lb/>Source: Vaalavuo (2011) (Different national sources, see Annex 2) <lb/>48. <lb/>Information on publicly-funded elderly care expenditures by age groups is available for the five <lb/>Nordic countries, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the <lb/>United Kingdom. Using the proportions of users by age group (see Table 3), the amount of public spending <lb/>on each age group is derived. This amount is further divided by the total number of people in the age group <lb/>in question reflecting now both the volume of spending and the user profile. This results in a monetary <lb/>value per person in each age group that we can then allocate to individuals in the dataset. The logic is the <lb/>same as for the imputation of health care expenditures. The number of age groups varies from one to five <lb/>according to the data available. The possibility to distinct between home care and residential care was <lb/>available for Estonia, Finland, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. <lb/>49. <lb/>Institutionalisation or reliance on domestic care does not only depend on severity of illness, but <lb/>also on matters such as marital status, availability of informal caregivers, incentives to be found in the <lb/>organisation of public care system and even the walking distance to public transports (Österle 2002). <lb/>Despite the fact that people living in institutions are excluded from the survey, this in-kind benefit is <lb/>included in the imputation. Even if no respondent in the data is actually staying in an elderly institution, <lb/>this service is considered as an insurance against old age, thus the possible, not real, benefit is taken into <lb/>account here. <lb/>3.8 Adjusting for differences in needs <lb/>3.8.1 What equivalence scale should be applied for in-kind benefits? <lb/>50. <lb/>In distributional studies, it is common practice to correct household income with an equivalence <lb/>scale to take account of economies of scale: the needs of a household grow with each additional member, <lb/>but not in a proportional way (OECD 2005a). Following standard practice, the equivalence scale used in <lb/>this report for adjusting household disposable income is the square root of household size. 20 But when <lb/>20 <lb/>See OECD (2005a) (http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/52/35411111.pdf) for further explanations and <lb/>specifications. <lb/>65-74 <lb/>75-84 <lb/>85+ <lb/>65-74 <lb/>75-84 <lb/>85+ <lb/>Denmark <lb/>0.07 <lb/>0.23 <lb/>0.52 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.34 <lb/>Estonia <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.07 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>Finland <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.25 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.19 <lb/>France <lb/>.. <lb/>.. <lb/>.. <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.24 <lb/>Germany <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.31 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.24 <lb/>Hungary <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.13 <lb/>0.18 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>Iceland <lb/>0.21 <lb/>0.21 <lb/>0.21 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.40 <lb/>Italy <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>0.09 <lb/>0.33 <lb/>0.60 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>0.34 <lb/>Norway <lb/>0.08 <lb/>0.26 <lb/>0.62 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.23 <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>0.09 <lb/>0.09 <lb/>0.09 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.14 <lb/>Spain <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.15 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>Sweden <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.13 <lb/>0.39 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.27 <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>.. <lb/>.. <lb/>.. <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.11 <lb/>0.11 <lb/>Home based services <lb/>Institutional care <lb/></body>

			<body>non-cash income components are included, this may give rise to what Radner (1997) has called the <lb/> &quot; consistency &quot; problem: some types of non-cash income may have needs associated with them that are <lb/>unmeasured in usual equivalence scales. The question is particularly relevant in the case of poverty <lb/>analysis, as inclusion of non-cash incomes can represent considerable relative changes in income to low-<lb/>income households. Consider two single-person households with each USD 1000 cash income. Person A is <lb/>ill and receives public health care worth USD 200, whereas person B is healthy and needs no health care. <lb/>Consequently, person A could be said to have 20% more needs than B because of differences in health care <lb/>needs, and his equivalence scale should be 1.2 compared to 1 for B. <lb/>51. <lb/>Even though the problem is recognized in the literature, the standard approach in most empirical <lb/>studies is to apply the same equivalence scale for both cash and extended income. Garfinkel et al. (2006) <lb/>defend this approach because &quot; on the one hand, in-kind benefits do not exhibit economies of scale, which <lb/>implies they should be divided by household size rather than the square of the household size. On the other <lb/>hand, in-kind benefits are not shared equally by all family members, which suggests that they should be <lb/>added to equivalent cash income on an individual basis. (…) Thus our use of the same equivalence scale <lb/>for both cash and in-kind expenditures is a reasonable middle-of-the-road solution &quot; . <lb/>52. <lb/>Table 4 illustrates these three options for a &quot; typical &quot; poor household consisting of two adults and <lb/>two children aged 8 and 13. 21 The disposable cash household income is USD 40,000. Applying the <lb/>standard OECD equivalence scale, which is the square root of household size, this is converted to USD <lb/>20,000 of equivalent income attached to each individual (column (1)). The child of 8 years is enrolled in <lb/>primary school (value estimated as USD 3,000), whereas the 13 year old is in lower secondary education <lb/>(value USD 5,000). The corresponding amounts for extended income (i.e. cash income plus in-kind <lb/>benefits) using the three alternative options are presented in columns (2) through (4). <lb/>53. <lb/>The amounts of extended income can differ considerably, depending on the option that is chosen. <lb/>Moreover, this will also affect how poverty outcomes are assessed. Using a fixed 22 poverty line (50% of <lb/>the median income before imputation, i.e. USD 21,000), all members of this household are counted as non-<lb/>poor after imputation of education expenditures, on either a cash income equivalence scale (column 2) or <lb/>on a per-capita basis (column 3). However, when in-kind benefits are attributed to the individual user only, <lb/>then the two adults remain poor (column 4). Using a floating poverty line, the assessment differs when in-<lb/>kind benefits are imputed on a per-capita basis: in that case, all family members remain poor. <lb/>21 <lb/>The illustrative values shown in Table 4 are derived from the empirical data used in this study. <lb/>22 <lb/>The difference between a fixed and a floating poverty line is discussed later in chapter 3.9. <lb/></body>

Below, these approaches are applied empirically in order to test the sensitivity of <lb/>the results with regard to the standard use of the cash income equivalence scales to other specifications. <lb/>3.8.2 A theoretically derived equivalence scale based on minimum expenditures of public services <lb/>55. <lb/>Very recently Aaberge et al. (2010a and 2010b) have proposed a new methodology aiming to <lb/>offer a solution to the issue of differences in needs. In the first paper (2010a) the authors derive a <lb/>theoretical model, drawing on detailed Norwegian data, whereas the second paper (2010b) extends the <lb/>application of this approach to EU member countries. 23 <lb/>56. <lb/>The core piece of the methodology of Aaberge et al. (2010a &amp; 2010b) is the construction of a <lb/>joint equivalence scale for extended income, defined as the weighted average of scales for cash and non-<lb/>cash income. This joint scale implies that &quot; individuals who are unequal with respect to needs for public <lb/>services are given unequal weights in the needs adjustment &quot; (Aaberge et al. 2010b). <lb/>3.8.2.1 Theoretical model <lb/>57. <lb/>This innovative methodology proposes to construct a household equivalence scale that takes <lb/>account of needs that are associated with cash income on the one hand (which corresponds largely to <lb/>consumption of goods) and the needs that are linked with public services such as e.g. health care and <lb/>education, on the other. This latter category in general does not exhibit economies of scale, and <lb/>23 <lb/>This approach has been discussed with the author at a workshop meeting in May 2010. We would like to <lb/>thank Rolf Aaberge for his availability and him and his team for permission to use this approach in the <lb/>frame of the present study. <lb/></body>

			<body>consequently should be derived in a different way as the cash income equivalence scale, which structure is <lb/>typically characterised by scale economies. <lb/>58. <lb/>The reasoning behind applying a different scale of in-kind services is the assumption that specific <lb/>population groups have extra needs for specific services and that these groups should not suffer <lb/>economically because they belong to a household with a high need for specific services. To take the <lb/>example of health and older people above, this means that health services received by families with older <lb/>people should not only count as an increase in extended income but should also be counterbalanced by <lb/>increasing the equivalence scale for these families. <lb/>59. <lb/>The construction of a joint equivalence scale involves several steps. In a first step, an equivalence <lb/>scale for public services for each individual is established, based on values of group-specific spending <lb/>(relative to a reference group). In Aaberge et al. 2010a detailed data on local government spending in <lb/>Norway are used to estimate a Linear Expenditure System (LES) that explains differences in spending <lb/>behaviour of Norwegian municipalities. This model is applied to determine the minimum expenditures per <lb/>service category per target group 24 that a social planner considers as necessary, taking into account (a) <lb/>heterogeneity in expenditure needs, and (b) local preferences for allocation of income to different services. <lb/>These minimum expenditures indicate how much budget the social planner has to spend on each person in <lb/>a certain target group to ensure that a certain level of social welfare is attained for each member of this <lb/>target group; they are the basis for deriving for each individual the equivalence scale associated with the <lb/>public services. This individual equivalence scale is derived as the sum of the public service expenditures <lb/>allocated to this individual compared to a reference amount. It is assumed that the sector-specific <lb/>discretionary income is allocated to target groups by the same proportions as minimum expenditures. <lb/>60. <lb/>What Aaberge et al (2010a &amp; 2010b) call the needs-adjusted equivalence scale NA for household <lb/>h, is a weighted average of the cash income equivalence scale CI h – which remains the familiar modified <lb/>OECD scale – and the sum of the individual non-cash income equivalence scales NC j (for public service j): <lb/>(1) NA h = θ r CI h + (1-θ r )∑ j n hj NC j <lb/>The weight θ r is equal to the ratio between the minimum required cash income and the minimum <lb/>required extended income of the reference group r. The number of members of household h in target <lb/>group j is given by n hj . <lb/>61. <lb/>The choice of the reference person is important as it determines both the non-cash income <lb/>equivalence scale and the weight of the cash and non-cash income equivalence scale. The reference target <lb/>group r can be anybody, e.g. somebody with either high or low needs. Following the theoretical <lb/>framework presented in Aaberge et al (2010a) the same reference person has to be used for 1) constructing <lb/>the in-kind equivalence scale, and 2) calculating the weight θ r . As the equivalence scale is a relative one, <lb/>the choice of the reference group should not pose a problem (see Blackorby and Donaldson, 1993 for the <lb/>issue of relative and absolute equivalence scales). <lb/>62. <lb/>As all values are expressed in terms of a reference household by the social planner (hence, a <lb/>relative equivalence scale), the choice of this reference group changes also the reference framework. When <lb/>scale invariant indices (like Gini coefficients and relative poverty rates) are used, the results are <lb/>independent of the choice of reference group. This means that changing the reference target group from <lb/>e.g. a single man aged 40 to a couple with two children (who have considerably higher needs for services, <lb/>see infra), will change the value of the equivalence scale, but not of the Gini coefficients or relative <lb/>24 <lb/>A target group is defined as a group of people with similar needs for public services. <lb/></body>

			<body>poverty rates. This is due to the fact that a change of reference group only leads to a scale transformation of <lb/>the needs adjusted-scale, which follows by straightforward calculation. <lb/>3.8.2.2 Target groups for needs adjustment <lb/>63. <lb/>Ideally, the definition of the target groups should follow as closely as possible the logic of the <lb/>services concerned. For some services (e.g. elderly care, or disability care, or administration) the definition <lb/>of the target group is rather straightforward, whereas for instance in the case of childcare and tertiary <lb/>education this is more difficult and can be very country specific. In the case of childcare, should all parents <lb/>with children in a specific age group (e.g. 0-6 year old) be considered as one target group, or should a <lb/>distinction be made between full-time working parents and others? In the latter case, why should full-time <lb/>employed parents have higher childcare needs? Perhaps non-working parents have these needs as well, but <lb/>childcare is not available, or not affordable, and thus they are not free in their choice between one and two <lb/>earnership. Research for Norway indicated for instance that childcare needs of parents are in general met, <lb/>thanks to widespread availability of childcare facilities: labour supply went up first, and the demand of <lb/>childcare followed. But this is probably not the case in all countries. <lb/>64. <lb/>Another service for which the definition of the target group is not evident is tertiary education: <lb/>should one consider only beneficiaries as a target group, or only use age limits to define potential <lb/>beneficiaries (e.g. all individuals aged 18-24)? The choices made to define target groups in this study are <lb/>discussed below for the three sectors of in-kind services considered in this study. For social housing it is <lb/>assumed that this type of costs is covered in the cash income equivalence scale, so there is no need to <lb/>incorporate this service in the non-cash income equivalence scale. <lb/>65. <lb/>The entire population forms the target groups for health care, though the level of spending differs <lb/>across individuals. Here, the insurance value approach is used to estimate benefits from health care <lb/>services, using age and gender to differentiate the amounts. As the data allow for a breakdown for each age <lb/>level, target groups can be defined here very specifically. For instance, a man aged 62 is allocated a <lb/>different amount compared to a man aged 63, and thus their needs differ and they will belong to different <lb/>target groups. A similar approach is followed for long-term elderly care, though the demarcation of target <lb/>groups is based on broader age groups. <lb/>66. <lb/>For education, target groups are formed by the actual beneficiaries of education services. As the <lb/>age limits for various education levels differ across countries (e.g. compulsory education has different <lb/>lower and upper age limits), the target groups are not defined by age, but by the actual education level the <lb/>person is currently enrolled in. The following education levels are considered: 1) pre-primary education; 2) <lb/>primary education; 3) lower secondary education; 4) upper secondary education; 5) post-secondary non-<lb/>tertiary education; 6) tertiary education. These groups are mutually exclusive, as one can only participate in <lb/>one education level at a time. It should, however, be noted that an age limit of 30 is applied. This means <lb/>that if somebody of 35 is in education, this person is assumed not to have education needs (even though the <lb/>benefit of the education service will be part of his or her imputed and thus extended income). Also for <lb/>early childhood services, actual beneficiaries are identified as target groups. <lb/>67. <lb/>Aaberge et al. (2010b) argue that the observed pattern of public spending on these services across <lb/>target-groups is &quot; a result of complex processes where decisions made by democratic institutions play a <lb/>major role. The relative spending across target groups may thus be considered as reflecting the priorities of <lb/>policy decision makers and/or the expert opinion on relative needs of different target groups. &quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>3.8.2.3 Constructing an equivalence scale adjusted for needs associated with public services. <lb/>68. <lb/>In order to specify an equivalence scale that incorporates the needs associated with public <lb/>services, we start from the target groups described in the previous section. For each target group a <lb/>monetary value of public services is imputed along the lines described in the previous chapters. A <lb/>reference group is chosen, namely a single man who is aged 40 and has no children. For the various target <lb/>groups, individual non-cash income is divided by that of the reference group in order to construct the non-<lb/>cash income equivalence scale. In the next step the average value of this scale is calculated over <lb/>countries. 25 <lb/>69. <lb/>Hence, the equivalence scale for non-cash incomes is defined in terms of average service <lb/>standards, though in the theoretical framework Aaberge et al. (2010a) propose to use minimum service <lb/>standards. Aaberge et al. (2010b) indicate, however, that results are independent of this choice, because <lb/>ratios of standards between different target groups do not change if the average service standard is replaced <lb/>with that of half the median service standard, since the median in kind benefit is equal to the average when <lb/>all in-kind transfers to a given target group are equal (which is the case). Next, the individual non-cash <lb/>income equivalence scales NC j are summed over household members. <lb/>70. <lb/>In the following step, half of average cash income of the reference target group is calculated over <lb/>countries. Half of the amount is taken in order to be close to the idea of minimum required cash income. <lb/>This amount is then combined with half of the reference amount of in-kind benefits, which is taken as a <lb/>measure of minimum required in-kind income, in order to calculate the weight θ r , which is the ratio <lb/>between the minimum required cash income and the minimum required extended income of the reference <lb/>target group r. In our calculations, θ r is equal to 0.9710, thus a major weight is given to the cash income <lb/>equivalence scale in constructing the overall scale for extended income. Finally, formula (1) is applied to <lb/>derive the needs-adjusted equivalence scale for each household. <lb/>71. <lb/>Table 5 lists a selection of household types and the corresponding equivalence scales for cash <lb/>income (square root of household size), non-cash income (NC scale) and extended income (NA scale). The <lb/>examples given here are all for households with adults not in education. Results are in line with those <lb/>reported by Aaberge et al. (2010b). The age profiles of health care and long-term elderly care spending are <lb/>reflected in the NC-scale that increases with age and that shows higher needs for women compared to men. <lb/>Also household with children have higher values of the NC-scale, following patterns on education <lb/>spending. <lb/>25 <lb/>In this respect, the approach in this study differs from Aaberge et al. 2010b, who use the median; however, <lb/>as our target groups are very narrowly defined, the median may not return a value for each target group. <lb/>Hence, the average is taken. <lb/></body>

			<body>needs of the recipients of these services are equal to a specific sum of money. For example, we could <lb/>assume that the per capita amounts spent by the state for age-specific population groups on public <lb/>education and public health care depict accurately the corresponding needs of these groups. Then the <lb/>recalculation of equivalence scale is straightforward. &quot; <lb/>73. <lb/>Following this line of argumentation, the following should be valid for a household to remain at <lb/>the same welfare level before and after including public services in the income concept: <lb/>(2) y/e = (y + k) / e&apos; <lb/>with y being cash disposable income, e the modified OECD equivalence scale, k the value of public <lb/>services and e&apos; the new equivalence scale which incorporates the extra needs of the household <lb/>members for public services. <lb/>74. <lb/>This formula can be rewritten as <lb/>(3) e&apos; = (y + k) e / y <lb/>meaning that for all households (with y different from zero) the new equivalence scale can be derived. <lb/>Note that this scale is income-dependent, as its value decreases with income level, implying smaller <lb/>economies of scale for poorer households and larger ones for richer households. <lb/>75. <lb/>The value of k differs across countries, and can reflect differences social priorities. In this sense <lb/>this approach is similar to the one proposed by Aaberge et al. (2010a), namely that actual expenditures on <lb/>public services form the basis for the derivation of the corresponding needs. But as is apparent from a <lb/>comparison of formulae (1) and (3) the form of the proposed equivalence scale differs between the two <lb/>approaches. <lb/>76. <lb/>Paulus et al. (2010) propose to exploit differences in expenditures between countries to test the <lb/>sensitivity of distributive results for alternative specifications of k. In each country the value of k used in <lb/>formula (3) is adjusted in such a way that it corresponds to the unweighted average for the different <lb/>services considered. In this study, this would imply that public spending for education (with breakdowns <lb/>for the different levels), for health care (for different age groups), ECEC (for different types) and long-term <lb/>elderly care are adjusted to the EU average spending. <lb/>77. <lb/>Thus for each household with n members (i=1,...,n) with different characteristics (corresponding <lb/>to the definition of target groups in the approach by Aaberge et al. (2010)), the value of k is calculated as: <lb/>(4) <lb/>With k ENi , k HNi ,k ECN , k LNi .being the country &quot; s spending for respectively public education, health care, <lb/>ECEC and long-term elderly care for persons with characteristics i; S ENi , S HNi , S CNi , S LNi being the <lb/>country &quot; s spending figures for the four types of services expressed as a share of national GDP per <lb/>capita and S LEUi S EEUi S HEUi S CEUi being the corresponding EU averages. The new equivalence scale e&apos; <lb/>of formula (3) is then recalculated for all households using the new value of k, which reflects EU <lb/>averages of spending. <lb/>78. <lb/>Application of this methodology is in fact a sensitivity test for differences in national spending <lb/>across countries, and thus gives an indication of cross-country differences with respect to the underlying <lb/>needs associated with public services. It assumes that the needs of the recipients are reflected in per capita <lb/>spending amounts for specific target groups. In this way it is similar to the approach proposed by Aaberge <lb/></body>

			<body>et al. (2010). These two approaches are applied in section 4.3 in order to test the sensitivity of the results <lb/>for applying alternative equivalence scales. <lb/>3.9 Indicators to assess the pro-poorness of publicly provided services <lb/>79. <lb/>Almost all studies that investigate the distribution of publicly-provided services confine their <lb/>results to inequality indicators. Very few studies investigate the impact on poverty. The most notable <lb/>exception is Smeeding et al. (1993), which reports considerable reductions in poverty rates after inclusion <lb/>of public health care and education services. Furthermore, the imputation also slightly alters the ranking of <lb/>the seven countries in this study in terms of the poverty headcount. According to this study which uses data <lb/>for the early 1980s, poverty is reduced by between one quarter and one third in the Continental European <lb/>countries and the United States, but by half to two thirds in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom <lb/>(Table 6). Smeeding et al. opted to use a fixed poverty line (50% of median cash disposable income, kept <lb/>fixed before and after imputation of in-kind services) and in-kind benefits have been equivalised on a per <lb/>capita basis. <lb/>Table 6: Poverty reduction after imputing education and health care services, seven OECD countries, results <lb/>from earlier studies <lb/>Note: Data refer to the early 1980s. <lb/>Source: Smeeding et al. (1993), Table 7. <lb/>3.9.1 Should a &quot; fixed &quot; or a &quot; floating &quot; poverty line be used? <lb/>80. <lb/>A common practice in international comparative research is to use a relative poverty measure, <lb/>referring for instance to the share of people with income below 50% or 60% of the median equivalent <lb/>income. However, should the same poverty line be used for disposable cash and extended income (i.e. a <lb/> &quot; fixed &quot; poverty line), or should it be re-calculated separately for each income concept (i.e. a &quot; floating &quot; <lb/>poverty line)? There are good arguments for both solutions. Applying a fixed threshold (such as in <lb/>Smeeding et al. 1993 above) captures the effect of the size and incidence of in-kind benefits, but disregards <lb/>the re-ranking of individuals and the change in relative income differentials that may occur when moving <lb/>from the cash disposable income distribution to that of extended income. With a floating poverty threshold, <lb/>the poverty line is recalculated in order to comprise both cash and in-kind elements. The use of a floating <lb/>poverty line means that the values of the poverty thresholds are increased in the order of 18 to 47% (Table <lb/>A.3 in Annex 1) when all in-kind benefits are included in the income concept. This approach is applied in <lb/>Sutherland and Tsakloglou (2009) and the poverty effect then also incorporates the shifts in relative <lb/>positions that arise from including in-kind benefits; it looks at poverty levels that follow from the new <lb/>distribution of resources. The difference that the choice of the poverty line can make was already <lb/>illustrated in a hypothetical example (cf. supra). <lb/>Poverty rate for <lb/>adjusted disposable <lb/>cash income <lb/>Poverty rate for <lb/>income extended with <lb/>education and health <lb/>care services <lb/>Poverty reduction <lb/>Australia <lb/>15.1 <lb/>7.4 <lb/>51% <lb/>Canada <lb/>15.1 <lb/>7.2 <lb/>52% <lb/>Germany <lb/>7.5 <lb/>5.4 <lb/>28% <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>6.6 <lb/>4.7 <lb/>29% <lb/>Sweden <lb/>5.6 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>23% <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>13.5 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>68% <lb/>United States <lb/>18.5 <lb/>12.1 <lb/>35% <lb/></body>

			<body>3.9.2 The role of compositional factors for interpreting results of services&apos; impacts on poverty patterns <lb/>81. <lb/>In addition to the above conceptual considerations, the interpretation of results based on <lb/>comparing poverty indicators before and after in-kind services is not trivial. Adding in-kind services <lb/>changes the income distribution and the composition of the population at the bottom end, notwithstanding <lb/>which equivalence scale is applied and which poverty threshold is used. Poverty outcomes will be <lb/>determined to a large extent by the interaction between the characteristics of in-kind beneficiaries and <lb/>those of the initially poor population. If, for instance, beneficiaries of compulsory education expenditures <lb/>are predominantly non-poor and clustered around the middle of the distribution before taking account of <lb/>these expenditures (as is the case in the Nordic countries), including education services will further <lb/>accentuate the differential with low-income families without children. The effect on poverty reduction will <lb/>be lower than in countries where children are more concentrated at the bottom of the distribution and it <lb/>could even lead to the counter-intuitive result of increasing overall (relative) poverty. Likewise, in <lb/>countries with high old-age poverty, adding health services will have a higher poverty reduction impact. <lb/>These compositional factors may help explain why earlier studies find a much lower poverty reduction <lb/>effect of services in countries like Sweden and Germany (see Table 6 above). It is therefore important to <lb/>identify the distributional features and the composition of the poor population prior to the imputation of in-<lb/>kind services. <lb/>3.9.3 Poverty reduction potential of in-kind benefits <lb/>82. <lb/>Traditional indicators such as those comparing poverty headcounts before and after accounting <lb/>for services remain of somewhat limited use for policy considerations as they need to be interpreted <lb/>alongside information on the composition of the poor population in a given country, and because they <lb/>require a priori judgements about poverty thresholds. Hence, an alternative way of capturing the possible <lb/>poverty impact of public services is proposed. <lb/>83. <lb/>This alternative way looks at the &quot; pro-poor &quot; characteristics of services with a particular focus on <lb/>their poverty reduction potential, rather than on their arithmetic effects on poverty rates. Such an approach <lb/>also takes into account that poverty reduction per se is not the prime aim of education and health care <lb/>services. The question here is: what could be the overall impact of in-kind services on poverty given the <lb/>current level and distribution of these benefits and given the current composition of the poor population? <lb/>For instance, a given increase in expenditures on compulsory education will have a greater impact on <lb/>overall poverty reduction in countries where child poverty is much higher than overall poverty and where <lb/>the population share of pupils is high. <lb/>84. <lb/>To that aim, an indicator is constructed which first calculates the aggregated income shortfall of <lb/>the entire poor population, i.e. the total income value that would have to be spent to pull everyone out of <lb/>poverty – the usual poverty-gap measure. In a second step, the income values of all specific in-kind <lb/>services which accrue to the poor population are aggregated. This second aggregate then is divided by the <lb/>first one to obtain an indication of the poverty reduction potential of in-kind benefits: to which extent <lb/>might in-kind services reduce the current poverty gap? It can be compared to a similar measure for cash <lb/>transfers. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. <lb/>THE IMPACT OF IN-KIND BENEFITS ON INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND POVERTY <lb/>85. <lb/>This chapter presents the empirical analyses of the distribution effects of public services. In a first <lb/>step the effect of total public services is considered for the entire population. These overall results are <lb/>tested on the sensitivity for other specifications of the equivalence scales, using two innovative approaches <lb/>for incorporating the needs associated with public services (see section 3.8). Next, the effect of five major <lb/>services separately is investigated. These five services are education, health care, social housing, early <lb/>childhood education and childcare, and long-term elderly care. <lb/>86. <lb/>The presentation below follows three stages. For the total and for each category of services <lb/>separately, first their importance is indicated by their share of disposable income. Second, an overall <lb/>indication of potential distributional consequences is then shown by looking at the quintile distribution of <lb/>the respective benefit over respective beneficiaries. Finally, the distributive impact is considered with the <lb/>help of inequality summary indicators, such as the Gini coefficient and the poverty reduction potential <lb/>indicator (PRPI). 27 <lb/>4.1 The distributive impact of publicly provided in-kind benefits taken together <lb/>87. <lb/>A first question refers to the overall level of publicly provided services in comparison to cash <lb/>transfers. Figure 3 presents the value of in-kind benefits as a share of disposable household income for 27 <lb/>OECD countries. Taking into account the value of the five types of in-kind benefits considered in this <lb/>study would increase household disposable cash income by as much as 29% on average in the OECD. 28 <lb/>For comparison, the share of cash transfers (including old-age and survivor &quot; s benefits) amounts to 23% of <lb/>disposable income. There are only a few countries (Austria, Germany, Poland) where the value of cash <lb/>transfers compared to disposable income is higher than that of services (in line with the results on the <lb/>public spending shares in GDP depicted in Figure 1 above). <lb/>88. <lb/>The income-increasing effect of services is highest in the Scandinavian countries and Hungary <lb/>(35% or more) and lower in Australia and Greece (around 20%). Health care and education (excluding pre-<lb/>primary education) are by far the most important components. In most countries, the imputed value of <lb/>health care is higher than that of education; exceptions are Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Mexico, Norway <lb/>and Poland, where education forms the largest category. The services for early childhood education and <lb/>childcare increase household income on average by 2% but by more than 3% in Denmark, Finland, <lb/>Hungary and Sweden. Long-term elderly care services raise incomes by 1% and are highest in the four <lb/>Nordic countries and the Netherlands. In three countries, social housing increases household income by <lb/>more than 1%, namely in the Czech Republic (1.2%), in Ireland (1.6%) and in the United Kingdom (2.5%) <lb/>compared to an average of 0.4%. <lb/>27 <lb/>In the following empirical analyses, the terms &quot; poverty rate &quot; and &quot; &quot; poverty gap &quot; are used as short-cuts for <lb/>at-risk-of poverty rate and at-risk-of poverty gap. <lb/>28 <lb/>This is equivalent to an increase in households income from USD 21 500 to USD 27 600, for the average <lb/>of countries considered here.. <lb/></body>

Three broad <lb/>categories are considered, namely children (aged younger than 18), adults of working age (18 – 65 year <lb/>old) and elderly (older than 65). Children (and their families) are the main beneficiaries of education <lb/>services while older people (and their families) are main beneficiaries of health services. In the vast <lb/>majority of countries, children are the ones with the largest share of in-kind benefits in disposable income, <lb/>with on average 40%, followed by 39% for the elderly and 23% for working age individuals (Figure 4). <lb/>There are only some exceptions to this pattern, and in all these countries older people would have the <lb/>largest increase in income when in-kind benefits are imputed: especially in Denmark, Iceland, the <lb/>Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the elderly would increase their cash income by <lb/>half or more. For working age adults, the increase in income would be between 10% and 30%, which is in <lb/>all countries the lowest of the three age categories, with the exception of Poland, where the elderly have <lb/>the lowest share. <lb/>0% <lb/>5% <lb/>10% <lb/>15% <lb/>20% <lb/>25% <lb/>30% <lb/>35% <lb/>40% <lb/>45% <lb/>0% <lb/>5% <lb/>10% <lb/>15% <lb/>20% <lb/>25% <lb/>30% <lb/>35% <lb/>40% <lb/>45% <lb/>Education <lb/>Health Care <lb/>Social Housing <lb/>ECEC <lb/>LTC <lb/>CT excl. pens <lb/>CT incl. pensions <lb/></body>

A first step is therefore to analyse the increase in household <lb/>income resulting from imputation of services by income groups.

This pattern is strikingly similar across countries. <lb/>Only in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, in-kind benefits are somewhat <lb/>more targeted to the lower income groups. <lb/>Figure 5.

Before <lb/>considering services, income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is high (around 0.37) in <lb/>Portugal and the United States and highest in Mexico (0.47), and comparatively low (0.25 and below) in <lb/>Slovenia, Sweden, Norway and Denmark (see Figure 6).

The Gini coefficient ranges from zero (when everybody has <lb/>identical incomes) to 1 (when all income goes to only one person). <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>94. <lb/>Table A.5 in Annex 1 presents estimates of the effects of public services for additional inequality <lb/>indicators, the interquintile share ratio S80/S20 (i.e. the sum of income going to the top 20% divided by the <lb/>share going to the bottom 20%) and the P90/P10 decile ratio (i.e. the ratio of the income of the person at <lb/>the 9 th decile to the person at the 1 st decile). Cash income inequality follows a similar pattern for the three <lb/>indicators in terms of country ranking. The effect of including public services in the income concept is <lb/>even more pronounced with the last two measures compared to the Gini: the p90/p10 ratio declines from <lb/>3.94 to 2.85 (or -26%), and the S80/S20 ratio drops even with almost 30% (from 4.95 to 3.43) after <lb/>including public services. These two tail-sensitive measures report higher inequality reductions due to the <lb/>fact that the in-kind benefits represent a high relative income share for the lower incomes (as was shown in <lb/>Table 7). <lb/>95. <lb/>There is no systematic relation between initial levels of cash income inequality and the degree of <lb/>inequality reduction through in-kind benefits, although some high-inequality countries strongly reduce <lb/>inequality through in-kind benefits. The United Kingdom and, according to most inequality measures, the <lb/>United States, Mexico and Portugal achieve higher reduction rates while the low-inequality country <lb/>Slovenia records lower ones. The variation in inequality levels across OECD countries (as measured by the <lb/>coefficient of variation) is not reduced when taking account of publicly-provided services – but only when <lb/>estimates are based on the Gini coefficient. Using alternative more tail-sensitive inequality measures, <lb/>however, reduces cross-country dispersion. These results are in line with Garfinkel et al. (2006) who find <lb/>for 10 OECD countries in the late 1990s, that cross-country differences in inequality at the bottom of the <lb/>income distribution are reduced following inclusion of in-kind benefits. <lb/>0,00 <lb/>0,10 <lb/>0,20 <lb/>0,30 <lb/>0,40 <lb/>0,50 <lb/>Gini <lb/>Cash income <lb/>Extended income <lb/></body>

			<body>4.2 <lb/>The impact of publicly provided in-kind benefits on poverty <lb/>96. <lb/>How do public services affect relative poverty? Figure 7 compares poverty rates for cash <lb/>disposable income with poverty rates for extended income (i.e. including the monetary value of public <lb/>services), using both a &quot; floating &quot; and a &quot; fixed &quot; poverty threshold. With a floating poverty line, the poverty <lb/>line is set at 50% of median equivalent cash income and at 50% of median equivalent extended income, <lb/>respectively. The results are illustrative and should not be interpreted as &quot; actual &quot; poverty reduction, as <lb/>discussed in the methodological part of this paper. Before accounting for services, overall poverty rates are <lb/>high in Mexico and the United States, and low in most Nordic countries, the Netherlands and the Czech <lb/>and Slovak Republics. When measuring poverty reduction on the basis of floating poverty lines, poverty is <lb/>almost halved following the inclusion of all public services in the income concept: the overall poverty rate <lb/>decreases from 10% to 5%. In Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom, poverty is reduced with close to <lb/>60%, whereas the reduction is much smaller in Estonia and Sweden (around 25%). There is more of a <lb/>correlation between initial poverty levels and reduction rates which means that cross-country variation in <lb/>poverty based on extended income actually gets higher: at-risk-of poverty levels for disposable income <lb/>vary between 6% and 18% but levels for extended income vary between 3% and 10%. <lb/>97. <lb/>The arithmetic reduction in poverty rates is even higher when a fixed poverty line is used, i.e. <lb/>50% of median equivalent cash income is applied to both cash and extended income. On average the head <lb/>count falls from 10% to as low as 2% (corresponding to a reduction of around 80%). Poverty reduction is <lb/>highest (above 85%) in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, <lb/>Portugal and Mexico, and lowest in Germany, Greece, Norway and the United States (less than 75%). <lb/>Figure 7. Poverty rates before and after including total of public services, fixed and floating poverty line, 2007. <lb/>Note: Countries are ranked in increasing order of disposable income poverty. <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>98. <lb/>Poverty reduction is not the prime aim of education, health and other in-kind services. The <lb/>question rather is what could be the overall impact of in-kind services on poverty given the current level <lb/>0% <lb/>5% <lb/>10% <lb/>15% <lb/>20% <lb/>25% <lb/>0% <lb/>2% <lb/>4% <lb/>6% <lb/>8% <lb/>10% <lb/>12% <lb/>14% <lb/>16% <lb/>18% <lb/>20% <lb/>Cash disposable income <lb/>Extended income (fixed PL) <lb/>Extended income (Floating PL) <lb/></body>

			<body>and distribution of these benefits and given the current composition of the poor population. For instance, a <lb/>given increase in expenditures on compulsory education will have a greater impact on overall poverty <lb/>reduction in countries where poverty among families with young children is much higher than overall <lb/>poverty and where the population share of pupils is high. <lb/>99. <lb/>To that aim, a poverty reduction potential indicator (PRPI) is constructed (see chapter 3.9). It <lb/>measures the amount of the expenditures spent below the poverty line. As can be expected the poverty <lb/>reduction potential of the total of in-kind benefits is very high (on average 80%). With around 90% levels <lb/>are particularly high in France, Ireland, Mexico and Portugal. Australia, Germany and Norway report the <lb/>smallest reduction potential. When compared to cash transfers (excluding old-age and survivor &quot; s benefits) <lb/>the potential of in-kind benefits is much larger in all countries. The gap between cash transfers and in-kind <lb/>benefits is especially large in the Southern European countries and Mexico. Including old-age and <lb/>survivor &quot; s pensions in the cash transfers brings the potential of cash transfers to a higher level (plus 15 <lb/>percentage points), reaching a level that is in some countries quite close to the value of public services (e.g. <lb/>in Hungary and Slovenia). <lb/>100. <lb/>The poverty reduction potential is, however, not the same across the different age groups. Not <lb/>surpisingly, given their population weight, the reduction potential is highest among the people aged <lb/>between 18 and 64 years. Overall, the working age category receives the largest share of expenditures <lb/>below the poverty line: on average 48% of the poverty gap is reduced by spending of which this category is <lb/>beneficiary, on a total of 82%. However, compared to their share in the population (see Table A.4 in <lb/>Annex 1) they are underrepresented in the poverty reduction potential gap. The working age population <lb/>accounts on average for 65% of the population, whereas they account for only half of the total PRPI. <lb/>101. <lb/>The PRPI for the elderly is on average 11%, with much lower shares in Hungary, the Czech <lb/>Republic, Luxembourg and Poland, and the highest one in Slovenia. For children it is on average 23%, <lb/>with the highest share in Mexico, and lower ones in Germany and Finland. The contribution of the <lb/>youngest age group to the reduction of the poverty gap is clearly more than their share in the population <lb/>(which is on average 21% for the OECD, see Table A.4 in Annex 1). <lb/></body>

Income advantage from public services and cash transfers going below the poverty line as a share of <lb/>the poverty gap of disposable income, poverty line at 50% of median equivalent income <lb/>Note: Countries are ranked in decreasing order by share of in-kind benefits spent below the poverty line in poverty gap. <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>4.3 The sensitivity of results for alternative specifications of the equivalence scale <lb/>102. <lb/>In section 3.8, two innovative approaches have been discussed for taking account of the needs <lb/>associated with public services, namely a theoretically based needs-adjusted equivalence scale (proposed <lb/>by Aaberge et al., 2010, and which is presented here by the abbreviation &quot; sd_aa &quot; ) and the approach <lb/>proposed by Paulus et al. (2010) which tests the sensitivity for differences in spending levels (further <lb/>abbreviated as &quot; tb_pa &quot; ). For a selection of countries, the inequality and poverty outcomes when using these <lb/>two alternative approaches are compared here with the outcomes in the previous section that make use of <lb/>the cash income equivalence scale for both cash incomes and extended incomes. <lb/>103. <lb/>Figure 9 shows the Gini coefficients for cash and extended income, with three equivalence scales <lb/>for this last income concept. On average, when using the theoretically based approach presented by <lb/>Aaberge et al. (2010), inequality decreases in a way that is very similar to the considerable drop that occurs <lb/>when using the standard equivalence scale for extended income. This is the case for all countries. The <lb/>approach proposed by Paulus et al. (2010), on the contrary, yields inequality outcomes that hardly change <lb/>on average when moving from cash to extended income. For Estonia and Southern European countries, <lb/>inequality levels even increase somewhat (due to their lower spending levels), whereas in the Nordic <lb/>countries inequality tends to decrease, which follows from their relatively high spending levels. The other <lb/>two inequality indices provide the same picture and are hence not presented. <lb/>0% <lb/>10% <lb/>20% <lb/>30% <lb/>40% <lb/>50% <lb/>60% <lb/>70% <lb/>80% <lb/>90% <lb/>100% <lb/>0% <lb/>10% <lb/>20% <lb/>30% <lb/>40% <lb/>50% <lb/>60% <lb/>70% <lb/>80% <lb/>90% <lb/>100% <lb/>Public services (total) <lb/>&lt;= 18 year <lb/>18 -65 y <lb/>65+ y <lb/>Cash transfers (excl. pensions) <lb/>Cash transfers (incl. pensions) <lb/></body>

Slovenia, Belgium, Finland, and Estonia are somewhat less oriented <lb/>towards the bottom quintile (with shares of 17%), whereas in countries like Poland, Italy, Greece, Canada <lb/>and Hungary a higher share of total education expenditures is going to the bottom quintile (24-25%). The <lb/>redistributive impact is, however, likely to be different for different levels of education. Compulsory <lb/>education can be expected to be more redistributive than higher education, since the former is supposed to <lb/>benefit equally all school-age children, while tertiary education service has been shown to often be <lb/>regressive (e.g. OECD 2008a). <lb/>107. <lb/>Compulsory education is slightly more oriented towards low income groups: on average, the <lb/>bottom quintile receives 23% of expenditures of this education category, compared to only 14% for the top <lb/>quintile (Figure 11, Panel B). This pattern is strongest in Greece and Poland (with a Q1 share of 28%), and <lb/>then decreases gradually over the countries towards 20%. In the Nordic countries and in Germany the <lb/>distribution of compulsory education is more middle-class biased, with significantly less than 20% of <lb/>expenditures going to both the bottom and the top quintile. The general progressive pattern elsewhere is <lb/>driven by the fact that children in compulsory education tend to be situated more in the lower parts of the <lb/>income distribution (see Figure A.1 in the Annex 1). <lb/>0% <lb/>2% <lb/>4% <lb/>6% <lb/>8% <lb/>10% <lb/>12% <lb/>14% <lb/>16% <lb/>18% <lb/>Primary <lb/>Lower secondary <lb/>Upper secondary <lb/>Post secondary <lb/>Tertiary <lb/>DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2011)15 <lb/>42 <lb/>Figure 11.

			<body>108. <lb/>The distribution pattern of upper-secondary education tends to be similar to that of compulsory <lb/>education (Figure 11 Panel C). In general, these expenditures are distributed rather equally. Countries in <lb/>which less than 15% of expenditures go to the bottom quintile are Iceland, Germany, Mexico and the <lb/>Netherlands (11-13%). Again, this pattern mirrors the relative position of beneficiaries within the income <lb/>distribution (see Figure A.2 in Annex 1). <lb/>109. <lb/>The pattern of the allocation of tertiary education services is quite different (see Figure 11 Panel <lb/>D). The OECD-average indicates a regressive pattern with close to 30% of tertiary education expenditures <lb/>going to the top quintile of the income distribution. This, however, hides considerable cross-country <lb/>variation. The regressive pattern is most pronounced in Estonia and Mexico where the poorest 20% receive <lb/>less than 8% of tertiary education spending while, in the Nordic countries and Germany, this group <lb/>accounts for up to 51% of tertiary education services in Denmark and 25% in Iceland. In these countries, <lb/>many students live away from their parents and are thus classified as a separate household and, due to low <lb/>incomes, are often concentrated in the poorest 20% of the population (see also Figure A.3 in Annex 1). <lb/>110. <lb/>The Gini coefficient drops considerably when including public education services in the income <lb/>concept. On average, it falls from 0.30 to 0.28, with a relatively low decline in Belgium and Finland and <lb/>more substantial reductions in countries like Mexico, Ireland and Poland (see Figure 12 and Table A.5 in <lb/>Annex 1). <lb/>Figure 12.

The poverty reduction potential of education <lb/>expenditures is considerable: education services could reduce the poverty gap by around 44% on average, <lb/>with the highest cuts in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Poland (+55%), and the lowest cuts in <lb/>Greece, Germany and Australia.

In most countries, compulsory <lb/>education spending is the main driver behind the potential poverty-gap reduction: 28% (compulsory) <lb/>compared to 12% (upper secondary) and 9% (tertiary). Especially Mexico, Poland, Ireland and <lb/>Luxembourg report high levels, mainly due to high spending on compulsory education, but also because of <lb/>relatively high shares of compulsory education pupils at the lower end of the distribution. The poverty <lb/>reduction potential of upper secondary education is with an average of 12% also important. This category <lb/>has a high score for this indicator (more than 15%) in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics and in <lb/>Belgium, Ireland and Poland. In most countries upper secondary education has a higher poverty reduction <lb/>potential than tertiary education, except in the Nordic countries. In these countries, tertiary education <lb/>expenditures have an indicator of around 20%. <lb/>31 <lb/>It should be noted that the combined effect of two (or more) education expenditure categories can be <lb/>smaller than the sum of the effect of both types considered separately, due to the fact that different <lb/>education levels may occur in one household. Take a household that is USD 500 below the poverty line <lb/>and receives in-kind benefits for compulsory education worth USD 1,000 and for upper secondary worth <lb/>2,000. Both benefits separately are sufficient to bring the household above the poverty line, so poverty <lb/>reduction is attributed to both levels when looking at education levels separately. This is of course only an <lb/>issue in households where the sum of benefits of different education levels is higher than its poverty gap. <lb/>0% <lb/>10% <lb/>20% <lb/>30% <lb/>40% <lb/>50% <lb/>60% <lb/>70% <lb/>&lt;= 18 year <lb/>18 -65 y <lb/>65+ y <lb/>Compulsory <lb/>Upper secondary <lb/>Tertiary <lb/></body>

			<body>4.6 The distributive impact of health care services <lb/>113. <lb/>Previous research that bases the imputation of public health care expenditure on the insurance <lb/>value approach reports a significant effect in reducing inequality in the distribution of economic resources <lb/>(see Marical et al., 2006 and 2008 for an overview). A main reason is that health care spending is <lb/>concentrated on the elderly who, in general, have below-average cash incomes (Gardiner et al. 1995). <lb/>Smeeding et al. (2008) report results for seven OECD countries that confirm these findings. <lb/>114. <lb/>Imputing the value of health care services increases disposable income by some 14% on average, <lb/>ranging from 11% in Poland, Australia and the Netherlands to 17% in Belgium, France and Sweden <lb/>(Figure 14). 32 In general, expenditures on women make up a slightly larger proportion than those on men. <lb/>Figure 14. In-kind benefit from health care services as a share of disposable income <lb/>Note: Countries are ranked in decreasing order by share of total health care expenditures in disposable income. <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>115. <lb/>The distribution of the income advantage deriving from health care is rather uniformly distributed <lb/>in the OECD countries (Figure 15). Somewhat higher shares going to the bottom quintile are found in the <lb/>United Kingdom and Australia, and shares somewhat below 18% in Q1 are found in Luxembourg and <lb/>Hungary. <lb/>32 <lb/>As in the case of education, the ranking of countries in terms of spending need not be the same as in <lb/>OECD, 2008c (Health at a Glance), which uses GDP as a denominator, whereas here disposable income is <lb/>used. <lb/>0% <lb/>2% <lb/>4% <lb/>6% <lb/>8% <lb/>10% <lb/>12% <lb/>14% <lb/>16% <lb/>18% <lb/>20% <lb/>Men <lb/>Women <lb/></body>

On average, it falls from 0.30 to 0.27, with relatively low decreases in Norway, the <lb/>Netherlands, Poland and Italy and, contrasted to more important drops in countries like Belgium and <lb/>Portugal (see Figure 16 and Table A.6 in Annex).

This is due to the relative position of women in the income <lb/>distribution, which is less favourable compared with that of men.

It is highest in France and Portugal and lowest in Norway and the <lb/>Netherlands. <lb/>4.7 The distributive impact of social housing 33 <lb/>119. <lb/>Previous studies (e.g. Gardiner et al., 2005; Saunders and Siminski, 2005) suggest that social <lb/>housing is probably the category of government services that benefit the poor the most. However, its <lb/>overall impact is smaller than for health care and education because of the much lower amounts of <lb/>spending. Social housing represents on average merely half a percent of disposable income. Nevertheless <lb/>it is an important service for the beneficiaries. If the analysis is confined to reduced rent tenants (see last <lb/>column of Table 8), social housing would increase their disposable income by 9% on average, with much <lb/>higher shares in the United Kingdom and Ireland 34 (more than 14%). But elsewhere too (Belgium, Spain, <lb/>Hungary and Italy), social housing represents more than 10% of disposable income for social renters. In <lb/>general and by design, the income-increasing effect of social housing is largely confined to the lower-<lb/>income quintiles – notable exceptions are the Czech Republic, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. <lb/>33 <lb/>Note that no estimates for social housing are available for Australia, Canada, Denmark, Mexico, the <lb/>Netherlands and the United States (see Chapter 3). Results for Greece and the Slovak Republic are only <lb/>illustrative, given the low number of cases in social housing. <lb/>34 <lb/>Note however that the overestimation of imputed rent in these two countries may play a role here, see <lb/>Chapter 3. <lb/>0% <lb/>10% <lb/>20% <lb/>30% <lb/>40% <lb/>50% <lb/>60% <lb/>70% <lb/>80% <lb/>&lt;= 18 year <lb/>18 -65 y <lb/>65+ y <lb/>HC men <lb/>HC women <lb/></body>

			<body>Table 8. Share of beneficiaries of social housing (SH) and in-kind benefit from social housing as a share of <lb/>disposable income per quintile <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>120. <lb/>The fact that social housing is often targeted at low income households is confirmed in the first <lb/>panel in Table 8 and in Figure 18. The share of beneficiaries decreases in all countries when moving up the <lb/>income ladder. For instance in the United Kingdom 36% of individuals in the bottom quintile live in social <lb/>housing, compared to less than 2% of the top quintile. But in other countries, 5 – 10 % of persons in the top <lb/>quintile live in social housing. It may be surprising that social housing is still present in the top quintile, <lb/>even when eligibility criteria include income ceilings. But often income ceilings apply at the moment of <lb/>entry; the social renters may meanwhile improve their income position over time without being obliged to <lb/>move to other housing. The share of social housing expenditures going to the bottom quintile is on average <lb/>37%, whereas the share of the top quintile is around 9% (Figure 43). However, the share going to the <lb/>bottom quintile exceeds 50% in Belgium, the Slovak Republic and Ireland, and is only around 20% in <lb/>Austria, the Czech Republic and Greece. <lb/>121. <lb/>The effect of social housing on overall inequality is rather limited. The Gini coefficient drops on <lb/>average with 1% (from 0.298 to 0.296) (see Table A.6 in Annex 1)). Notable exceptions are Ireland and the <lb/>United Kingdom, with reductions of around 4%, which is closely linked to the size of the imputed benefit <lb/>in these countries. <lb/>Q1 <lb/>Q2 <lb/>Q3 <lb/>Q4 <lb/>Q5 <lb/>Total <lb/>Q1 <lb/>Q2 <lb/>Q3 <lb/>Q4 <lb/>Q5 <lb/>Total <lb/>AUT <lb/>8.1% <lb/>7.1% <lb/>6.3% <lb/>5.4% <lb/>5.2% <lb/>6.4% <lb/>10.1% <lb/>6.7% <lb/>5.0% <lb/>4.8% <lb/>3.0% <lb/>5.2% <lb/>BEL <lb/>17.8% <lb/>9.4% <lb/>4.6% <lb/>2.7% <lb/>1.2% <lb/>7.1% <lb/>20.4% <lb/>10.0% <lb/>6.5% <lb/>5.1% <lb/>2.5% <lb/>11.6% <lb/>CZE <lb/>27.6% <lb/>17.9% <lb/>15.8% <lb/>15.5% <lb/>12.1% <lb/>17.8% <lb/>10.1% <lb/>8.5% <lb/>7.8% <lb/>7.2% <lb/>6.0% <lb/>7.7% <lb/>DEU <lb/>9.4% <lb/>6.6% <lb/>4.6% <lb/>4.0% <lb/>1.9% <lb/>5.3% <lb/>9.5% <lb/>6.3% <lb/>4.4% <lb/>3.4% <lb/>2.5% <lb/>5.3% <lb/>ESP <lb/>5.5% <lb/>2.7% <lb/>2.7% <lb/>2.3% <lb/>1.3% <lb/>2.9% <lb/>28.8% <lb/>11.6% <lb/>9.3% <lb/>6.2% <lb/>4.0% <lb/>10.6% <lb/>EST <lb/>2.6% <lb/>1.8% <lb/>1.7% <lb/>1.1% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>1.6% <lb/>17.4% <lb/>15.4% <lb/>5.9% <lb/>9.6% <lb/>2.6% <lb/>9.6% <lb/>FIN <lb/>31.9% <lb/>21.5% <lb/>11.9% <lb/>9.6% <lb/>4.1% <lb/>15.8% <lb/>7.1% <lb/>5.1% <lb/>3.9% <lb/>4.1% <lb/>3.1% <lb/>5.0% <lb/>FRA <lb/>23.1% <lb/>17.7% <lb/>15.7% <lb/>12.4% <lb/>7.7% <lb/>15.3% <lb/>13.2% <lb/>8.7% <lb/>6.2% <lb/>5.2% <lb/>1.5% <lb/>6.7% <lb/>GBR <lb/>36.3% <lb/>28.1% <lb/>14.8% <lb/>6.7% <lb/>1.6% <lb/>17.5% <lb/>41.4% <lb/>22.6% <lb/>18.8% <lb/>9.4% <lb/>7.2% <lb/>23.8% <lb/>GRC <lb/>0.9% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>1.0% <lb/>1.0% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>0.9% <lb/>13.2% <lb/>7.8% <lb/>6.1% <lb/>5.4% <lb/>1.0% <lb/>4.2% <lb/>HUN <lb/>6.9% <lb/>3.3% <lb/>3.3% <lb/>2.0% <lb/>2.7% <lb/>3.6% <lb/>24.3% <lb/>13.4% <lb/>16.3% <lb/>11.5% <lb/>7.1% <lb/>14.0% <lb/>IRL <lb/>28.0% <lb/>17.1% <lb/>9.1% <lb/>4.2% <lb/>1.9% <lb/>12.1% <lb/>37.7% <lb/>21.2% <lb/>13.8% <lb/>10.7% <lb/>5.9% <lb/>21.7% <lb/>ISL <lb/>15.3% <lb/>7.6% <lb/>5.1% <lb/>2.5% <lb/>1.2% <lb/>6.4% <lb/>8.0% <lb/>6.7% <lb/>7.7% <lb/>4.1% <lb/>4.9% <lb/>6.8% <lb/>ITA <lb/>4.6% <lb/>4.2% <lb/>2.2% <lb/>1.9% <lb/>0.8% <lb/>2.7% <lb/>29.3% <lb/>16.8% <lb/>11.6% <lb/>7.1% <lb/>3.8% <lb/>13.9% <lb/>LUX <lb/>7.2% <lb/>1.8% <lb/>2.1% <lb/>3.4% <lb/>2.1% <lb/>3.3% <lb/>11.6% <lb/>7.9% <lb/>5.5% <lb/>3.4% <lb/>0.9% <lb/>5.0% <lb/>NOR <lb/>8.0% <lb/>5.3% <lb/>2.5% <lb/>1.6% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>3.6% <lb/>9.2% <lb/>8.1% <lb/>6.8% <lb/>5.7% <lb/>6.0% <lb/>7.6% <lb/>POL <lb/>1.7% <lb/>1.5% <lb/>0.6% <lb/>0.8% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>1.1% <lb/>10.8% <lb/>8.0% <lb/>4.3% <lb/>5.0% <lb/>4.4% <lb/>6.2% <lb/>PRT <lb/>11.5% <lb/>10.1% <lb/>5.8% <lb/>7.4% <lb/>3.1% <lb/>7.6% <lb/>13.5% <lb/>9.7% <lb/>6.2% <lb/>3.9% <lb/>3.2% <lb/>6.7% <lb/>SVK <lb/>1.1% <lb/>0.5% <lb/>0.2% <lb/>0.5% <lb/>0.2% <lb/>0.5% <lb/>8.9% <lb/>3.9% <lb/>3.4% <lb/>1.3% <lb/>1.4% <lb/>4.0% <lb/>SVN <lb/>4.0% <lb/>1.8% <lb/>1.2% <lb/>1.3% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>1.8% <lb/>6.0% <lb/>3.1% <lb/>3.8% <lb/>1.7% <lb/>1.5% <lb/>3.4% <lb/>SWE <lb/>3.5% <lb/>2.4% <lb/>1.5% <lb/>1.4% <lb/>1.4% <lb/>2.0% <lb/>5.2% <lb/>2.3% <lb/>2.5% <lb/>2.1% <lb/>1.5% <lb/>2.6% <lb/>OECD-21 <lb/>12.1% <lb/>8.0% <lb/>5.4% <lb/>4.2% <lb/>2.5% <lb/>6.4% <lb/>16.0% <lb/>9.7% <lb/>7.4% <lb/>5.6% <lb/>3.5% <lb/>8.7% <lb/>Share of beneficiaries of SH <lb/>SH as share of disposable income, reduced rent tenants only <lb/></body>

			<body>(above 5%), in Finland, the Czech Republic, Belgium and France. In these countries, social housing <lb/>consists of a non-negligible share of the housing market. In general, the PRPI is highest for working-age <lb/>adults and children. <lb/>4.8 The distributive impact of early childhood education and childcare services 35 <lb/>123. <lb/>Spending on early childhood education and childcare (ECEC) service can be important when <lb/>compared to household income, ranging from 0.4% (Ireland) to 5% (Sweden) (Figure 20). For countries <lb/>where both categories can be estimated, childcare expenditures are predominant in the Nordic countries <lb/>(2.3% in Finland and 2.2% in Norway). In the other countries pre-primary education carries the biggest <lb/>weight, with more than 2% in Hungary, Iceland, Spain and Slovenia. <lb/>Figure 20. In-kind benefit from ECEC services as a share of disposable income <lb/>Note: Countries are ranked in decreasing order by share of ECEC expenditures in disposable income. <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>124. <lb/>The distribution of ECEC services over income groups varies greatly over countries (Figure 21). <lb/>In Hungary, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, the United States and Canada, ECEC services tend to go <lb/>more to the poorer groups: the first quintile receives almost 30% and the top quintile less than 15%. The <lb/>opposite, i.e. a rather regressive distribution is observed in Estonia, Finland, Greece, Denmark and Ireland, <lb/>where the lowest quintile receives less than 15% of all ECEC services. These patterns reflect the <lb/>distribution of ECEC beneficiaries over quintiles (see Figure A.5 in Annex 1), resulting either from the <lb/>demographic pattern (i.e. more or less young children in the quintile), or from differential use of ECEC <lb/>services. <lb/>35 A more detailed analysis of the distributive impact of ECEC services can be found in Förster and Verbist (2012). <lb/>0% <lb/>1% <lb/>2% <lb/>3% <lb/>4% <lb/>5% <lb/>6% <lb/>0% <lb/>1% <lb/>2% <lb/>3% <lb/>4% <lb/>5% <lb/>6% <lb/>Pre-primary education <lb/>Childcare <lb/>Total <lb/></body>

The answer is provided in Table 9 and may be surprising at <lb/>first glance: in most countries, children in higher and top income households are more likely to be enrolled <lb/>in public child care than those in lower-income households.

Actual ECEC beneficiaries as a share of potential beneficiaries (children aged 0-6), by income quintile <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national <lb/>survey data for non-EU countries. <lb/>126. <lb/>ECEC services imputed into household income represent a higher share of disposable income for <lb/>poorer than for richer households. This pattern is most pronounced in Hungary, Iceland, Luxembourg, <lb/>Sweden and Spain. In some of these countries, these in-kind benefits even amount to around 10% of <lb/>disposable income in the bottom quintile. The share in the top quintile is much more limited, being around <lb/>1% in the majority of the countries. <lb/>127. <lb/>As a consequence, in all countries inequality as measured by Gini coefficient decreases when <lb/>including ECEC services in the income concept (see Table A.6 in Annex 1). On average, this decrease is <lb/>small with some 1.2%. Reductions are strongest in Hungary, Iceland and Luxembourg. 36 The other two <lb/>indicators (S80/S20 and P90/P10) give similar results. <lb/>128. <lb/>While this effect seems low with regard to the overall population, redistribution through childcare <lb/>services is much stronger when the focus is on children and, furthermore, beneficiaries. Förster and Verbist <lb/>(2012) show that the reduction in overall income poverty is negligible when ECEC services are accounted <lb/>36 <lb/>Though these are not the countries where the enrolment of low-income children is the highest, they have <lb/>the highest shares of beneficiaries of ECEC services in low-income households: the bottom 20% in <lb/>Hungary and Luxembourg, and the bottom 40% in Iceland. <lb/>Q1 <lb/>Q2 <lb/>Q3 <lb/>Q4 <lb/>Q5 <lb/>Total <lb/>AUS <lb/>33.0% <lb/>35.0% <lb/>50.8% <lb/>39.3% <lb/>42.4% <lb/>40.1% <lb/>AUT <lb/>38.1% <lb/>44.7% <lb/>46.6% <lb/>42.8% <lb/>47.7% <lb/>43.2% <lb/>BEL <lb/>54.2% <lb/>69.9% <lb/>71.6% <lb/>75.7% <lb/>79.0% <lb/>69.2% <lb/>CAN <lb/>30.9% <lb/>32.9% <lb/>29.2% <lb/>27.5% <lb/>26.3% <lb/>29.8% <lb/>CZE <lb/>44.1% <lb/>45.6% <lb/>46.9% <lb/>40.0% <lb/>40.7% <lb/>43.8% <lb/>DEU <lb/>65.8% <lb/>59.9% <lb/>67.9% <lb/>61.0% <lb/>57.1% <lb/>62.8% <lb/>DNK <lb/>80.1% <lb/>80.4% <lb/>86.0% <lb/>86.8% <lb/>84.6% <lb/>83.8% <lb/>EST <lb/>56.1% <lb/>48.0% <lb/>54.2% <lb/>53.3% <lb/>48.4% <lb/>52.0% <lb/>ESP <lb/>64.7% <lb/>66.4% <lb/>66.9% <lb/>68.0% <lb/>72.7% <lb/>67.6% <lb/>FIN <lb/>42.2% <lb/>45.2% <lb/>55.2% <lb/>69.5% <lb/>66.1% <lb/>54.0% <lb/>FRA <lb/>63.4% <lb/>56.9% <lb/>63.4% <lb/>63.2% <lb/>70.8% <lb/>63.0% <lb/>GBR <lb/>33.7% <lb/>38.8% <lb/>45.7% <lb/>52.2% <lb/>53.1% <lb/>43.0% <lb/>GRC <lb/>33.2% <lb/>37.6% <lb/>38.1% <lb/>50.8% <lb/>43.8% <lb/>40.7% <lb/>HUN <lb/>53.0% <lb/>52.2% <lb/>54.9% <lb/>57.2% <lb/>55.7% <lb/>54.2% <lb/>IRL <lb/>15.1% <lb/>26.7% <lb/>31.5% <lb/>31.4% <lb/>43.0% <lb/>28.9% <lb/>ISL <lb/>59.3% <lb/>70.4% <lb/>67.4% <lb/>74.6% <lb/>66.8% <lb/>66.8% <lb/>ITA <lb/>55.3% <lb/>57.4% <lb/>57.4% <lb/>57.4% <lb/>68.9% <lb/>58.5% <lb/>LUX <lb/>52.2% <lb/>63.3% <lb/>64.3% <lb/>63.3% <lb/>75.6% <lb/>61.6% <lb/>MEX <lb/>15.2% <lb/>15.9% <lb/>16.2% <lb/>15.5% <lb/>16.1% <lb/>15.8% <lb/>NLD <lb/>66.2% <lb/>64.8% <lb/>66.8% <lb/>69.1% <lb/>85.5% <lb/>69.4% <lb/>NOR <lb/>48.6% <lb/>57.2% <lb/>60.2% <lb/>58.9% <lb/>67.6% <lb/>57.5% <lb/>POL <lb/>17.4% <lb/>17.2% <lb/>20.6% <lb/>24.5% <lb/>31.5% <lb/>21.8% <lb/>PRT <lb/>46.5% <lb/>45.3% <lb/>54.8% <lb/>68.1% <lb/>68.3% <lb/>56.2% <lb/>SWE <lb/>70.6% <lb/>70.6% <lb/>72.6% <lb/>70.0% <lb/>69.6% <lb/>70.9% <lb/>SVK <lb/>29.3% <lb/>33.4% <lb/>56.1% <lb/>42.4% <lb/>64.8% <lb/>43.2% <lb/>SVN <lb/>56.2% <lb/>64.1% <lb/>62.0% <lb/>57.7% <lb/>62.7% <lb/>60.4% <lb/>USA <lb/>29.6% <lb/>27.7% <lb/>29.5% <lb/>28.8% <lb/>28.5% <lb/>28.9% <lb/>OECD-27 <lb/>46.4% <lb/>49.2% <lb/>53.2% <lb/>53.7% <lb/>56.9% <lb/>51.4% <lb/></body>

THE DISTRIBUTIVE IMPACT OF PUBLIC SERVICES OVER TIME <lb/>134. <lb/>How has the impact of public services evolved over time? For a sub-set of 17 OECD countries <lb/>the distributive impact of public services can be compared over time with the earlier estimates presented in <lb/>OECD (2008a) which referred to a year around 2000. As only health care, education and social housing <lb/>were considered in OECD (2008a), the comparison is limited to these three policy domains. For reasons of <lb/>consistency, the total of education comprises also pre-primary education 37 . <lb/>135. <lb/>The importance of public services has increased over time for all the 18 countries considered: in <lb/>2000 it amounted on average to 13% of GDP, whereas in 2007 it was 14% (Table 10.). Especially in the <lb/>United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland and Greece, expenditures on public services became more <lb/>important. In half of the countries, expenditures remained more stable and increased by less than one <lb/>percentage point.

Evolution of public expenditures on in-kind transfers, in percentage of GDP, 2000 – 2007. <lb/>Source: OECD Social Expenditure database, OECD Education database, OECD Health database. <lb/>136. <lb/>Overall, the inequality impact of public services has remained remarkably stable: on average <lb/>across the OECD countries studied here, the Gini coefficient decreases by almost one fifth in both years <lb/>(Table 11.). In one third of countries, inequality reduction has increased by more than two percentage <lb/>points (Belgium, Canada, Spain, Finland, United Kingdom, Ireland). In another third, the redistributive <lb/>impact has, however, fallen (Austria, Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) and in the <lb/>remaining third, changes were below two points (results for the interquintile share ratio are presented in <lb/>Table A.6 in Annex 1). <lb/>137. <lb/>In both years the distributive effect of health care services is the strongest inequality reducing <lb/>component on average with a reduction of 11% in both years. In some countries inequality reduction <lb/>through health care services increases (notably Belgium, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland and <lb/>Portugal), which are all countries that experienced an increase in their public health care expenditures. On <lb/>the contrary, in a number of countries the inequality impact of public health care has weakened (notably <lb/>Australia, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands). The distributive impact of education has <lb/>rather decreased over time on average. Only in Belgium, Finland, Greece and Ireland has the inequality <lb/>reduction become stronger due to the inclusion of public education expenditures in the income concept. <lb/>Social housing has a small tendency of becoming more redistributive over time, but given that different <lb/>countries are involved and that the methodology differs somewhat for both years, it is difficult to draw <lb/>conclusions. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION <lb/>139. <lb/>This paper looks at how the income distribution in countries changes when the value of publicly-<lb/>provided services to households is included. It considers five major categories of public services: <lb/>education, health care, social housing, childcare and elderly care. The empirical results in this study refer <lb/>to 2007 for Australia and the European countries, and to 2004 for Canada, Mexico and the United States. <lb/>Some comparisons with results for previous years around 2000 are also presented. The study also gives <lb/>appropriate weight to discussing the methodological underpinning of imputing such &quot; in-kind &quot; income and <lb/>the consequences of applying alternative definitions and concepts. In particular, two very recently <lb/>developed approaches to account for differences in needs are tested and compared. Finally, the results <lb/>presented in this study are novel not only with regard to time and country coverage but also by analyzing <lb/>the effect of particular services separately. <lb/>5.1 <lb/>Identifying the size of social public services <lb/>140. <lb/>Public social services are social spending flows controlled by the General Government that can <lb/>be attributed to individual beneficiaries. Education and health care services are major categories under this <lb/>heading but also other social services, like those for childcare, elderly care, invalidity, etc. are relevant in <lb/>this context. <lb/>141. <lb/>Spending on publicly-provided services accounts for about 13% of GDP on average across <lb/>OECD countries, slightly more than the spending on cash transfers. 39 But there is considerable variation <lb/>across countries. In most of the Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Ireland, the <lb/>United Kingdom and the United States, spending on &quot; in-kind &quot; transfers is considerably higher than cash <lb/>transfer expenditures. On the contrary, cash transfers are more dominant than in-kind services in Austria, <lb/>Italy and Poland. <lb/>142. <lb/>There is a large variation in the size of services across OECD countries. The shares of in-kind <lb/>services in GDP range from simple to double digits: from around 8% in Turkey and Chile to close to 20% <lb/>in Denmark and Sweden. On average, the bulk of these services is made up of health care and education <lb/>services, some 5 to 6 % of GDP each. The remaining 2% consist of care services to children and the <lb/>elderly and social housing. <lb/>5.2 <lb/>Valuating and allocating public services: methodological challenges <lb/>143. <lb/>Before imputing the value of these services in household income and analyzing their <lb/>redistributive potential, the paper focuses in chapter 3 on the methodological challenges for empirically <lb/>investigating the distributive outcomes of including public services in an extended income concept. These <lb/>challenges include 1) the valuation of public services, 2) the allocation of these services (i.e. the <lb/>identification of beneficiaries), 3) the adjustment of the equivalence scale for needs associated with the <lb/>services, and 4) the specification of indicators to measure the poverty impact. For each of these challenges, <lb/>this report provides a contribution. <lb/>39 <lb/>The public effort on this type of social services is, however, not fully captured, as policy domains like <lb/>public transportation and public utilities are not included. <lb/></body>

			<body>144. <lb/>With respect to the issue of valuation, the standard approach of using the value of producing or <lb/>providing the service is applied for all services included but one: for social housing, the value of the in-<lb/>kind benefit is derived from prevailing market rents. For allocating the value of a public service to <lb/>beneficiaries, two possible methodological approaches can be used. This study applies the &quot; actual use <lb/>approach &quot; as the preferred one for imputing education, early childhood education and childcare services <lb/>and for social housing. For conceptual reasons but also because actual users of health care and long-term <lb/>elderly care cannot be identified with the data used in this study, the &quot; insurance value approach &quot; is applied <lb/>for these latter two categories. <lb/>145. <lb/>The third challenge relates to the fact that public services correspond to specific needs that are <lb/>not captured in the traditional equivalence scales used to correct cash disposable income for household size <lb/>and composition. Even though this problem has for long been recognized in the literature, most existing <lb/>studies apply the same equivalence scale for both cash and extended income. Recently, two innovative <lb/>approaches have been put forward in the literature to tackle this issue. Both use actual expenditures to <lb/>derive, on the one hand, an augmented equivalence scale that incorporates these needs (approach proposed <lb/>by Aaberge et al. 2010) and to develop, on the other hand, a sensitivity analysis that takes account of <lb/>different public spending levels across countries (proposed by Paulus et al., 2010). <lb/>146. <lb/>This study applies both these approaches and compares the resulting estimates in order to test the <lb/>sensitivity of the results for alternative specifications of the equivalence scale. Results in terms of <lb/>redistributive effects based on the first approach are, however, not much different from the &quot; standard &quot; one, <lb/>i.e. using the square root of household size scale for both cash and extended income. Using the second <lb/>approach results in some cross-country variation of redistributive outcomes that are revealed by looking at <lb/>cash incomes only, though differences are not large. Consequently, the &quot; standard approach &quot; using the <lb/>square root of household size scale was used throughout this paper, for both cash and extended income. <lb/>147. <lb/>With respect to the fourth challenge, an additional alternative way of capturing the possible <lb/>poverty impact of public services is proposed. The poverty reduction potential indicator shows what the <lb/>overall impact of in-kind benefits on poverty would be, given the current level and distribution of these <lb/>benefits and the current composition of the poor population. It gives an indication of the extent to which <lb/>these services might reduce the poverty gap if these in-kind benefits were given in cash to the <lb/>beneficiaries. <lb/>5.3 <lb/>The distributive impact of public services <lb/>148. <lb/>Broadening the income concept to account for in-kind benefits considerably increases <lb/>households &quot; economic resources and impacts on inequality and poverty outcomes. If all social public <lb/>services were imputed in disposable cash income, households &quot; resources would increase by close to 30%, <lb/>on average. The increase exceeds 40% in Sweden and 30% in Denmark, Norway, Iceland, as well as in <lb/>France and Hungary. In a typical OECD country, the average annual household income would be close to <lb/>USD 28 000, rather than USD 22 000 in purchasing power parities when in-kind benefits are included. <lb/>149. <lb/>Publicly-provided service benefits also contribute to reducing income inequality. Depending on <lb/>the indicator, in-kind benefits taken together reduce income inequality by one fifth (on the basis of the Gini <lb/>coefficient) to almost one third (when alternative inequality measures are used which give more weight to <lb/>the bottom and the top of the income distribution). The United Kingdom and, according to most inequality <lb/>measures, the United States, Mexico and Portugal achieve higher reduction rates while Slovenia records <lb/>lower ones. There is, however, no systematic relation between initial inequality levels in terms of cash <lb/>income and levels of inequality reduction through inclusion of in-kind benefits, but some high-inequality <lb/>countries record high reduction levels. The variation in inequality levels across OECD countries is <lb/>somewhat reduced when taking account of publicly provided services – but only when using more tail-<lb/>sensitive inequality measures such as quintile share or percentile ratios. <lb/></body>

			<body>150. <lb/>Imputing public services in household income also reduces poverty estimates to a considerable <lb/>amount. At-risk-of poverty rates fall substantially, by almost 40% when a &quot; floating &quot; poverty line is used <lb/>and even by close to 80% when a &quot; fixed &quot; poverty line is used. 40 Consequently, in-kind benefits taken <lb/>together would have the potential to reduce the poverty gap with on average 80%. The poverty impact is <lb/>larger than average for children and elderly, because of their higher use of education and health services. <lb/>151. <lb/>Redistributive and poverty reduction effects differ between service categories. By their sheer <lb/>size, benefits from total education and health have by far the largest inequality reduction potential. The <lb/>impact of social housing is much more modest, due to the lower budgetary amounts. However, for <lb/>beneficiaries (social renters) this service can make a difference, especially as it is more targeted to low-<lb/>income groups. The same is true for child care services and long-term elderly care: small overall effects, <lb/>but important reductions for the groups concerned. Overall income poverty, for instance, hardly reduced <lb/>when childcare services are accounted for, but poverty among young children falls by one quarter and <lb/>poverty among children enrolled in childcare is more than halved. <lb/>152. <lb/>Over the 2000s, the redistributive impact of public services has remained remarkably stable on <lb/>average across OECD countries. However, this impact got stronger in those countries where the share of <lb/>services in household income increased significantly, i.e. by more than four percentage points (e.g. <lb/>Belgium) and it weakened in those countries where this share strongly decreased (e.g. Italy). <lb/>153. <lb/>Taken together, these findings suggest that publicly provided services fulfil an important <lb/>redistributive role in OECD societies. These effects are substantial also in some of the OECD countries <lb/>which record higher inequality levels on the basis of disposable household income only. More importantly, <lb/>redistributive effects are larger for some specific population groups at higher risk of poverty. This is all the <lb/>more noticeable as redistribution is not among the prime aims of delivering public services. <lb/>154. <lb/>There are several issues which this study cannot address. Differences in the quality of services – <lb/>across but also within countries – is one of the most important among those. In order to materialise the <lb/>considerable redistributive potentials calculated in the analyses above, policies need to ensure that high-<lb/>quality health, education and care services are made available to all citizens. Moreover, in a dynamic <lb/>perspective, public childcare provision has a potential for secondary redistributive effects as childcare <lb/>allows both parents to work and hence helps increase family income. If such an increase is coupled with a <lb/>greater use of childcare by children from lower-income households this could reveal a considerable <lb/>inequality reduction potential among households with children. <lb/>155. <lb/>Another issue not addressed in this study concerns the tax side of redistribution. As most of the <lb/>available studies, this report takes account of the effects of direct income taxation (income taxes and <lb/>employees &quot; social security contributions) but disregards the impact of indirect consumption taxes. It can be <lb/>expected that consumption taxation is not distributionally neutral and further work is necessary to estimate <lb/>their impact on household income in a cross-country comparative perspective. 41 <lb/>156. <lb/>At the time of writing, many OECD member countries are considering and implementing <lb/>consolidation policies in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. This paper provides a large <lb/>amount of background information which will be helpful in evaluating eventual distributive consequences <lb/>40 <lb/>A &quot; fixed &quot; poverty line uses the same poverty threshold for disposable cash and extended income, namely <lb/>50% of the median disposable cash income. A &quot; floating &quot; poverty line recalculates the poverty threshold in <lb/>order to comprise both cash and in-kind elements.
