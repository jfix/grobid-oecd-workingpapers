DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 5 PREFACE Many analysts suggested that Latin America has faced the crisis in a much better 
macroeconomic position that in the past. Budgets balances were positive, debt-to-GDP ratios 
were low, and monetary policy was more credible thanks to low inflation and well-anchored 
expectations. Moreover, in contrast with the past, some of the countries in the region were able to 
enact fiscal stimulus packages comparable to those of OECD countries. Is Latin America's new 
resilience a permanent change? Some questions may require time to be responded, such as the 
effectiveness of counter-cyclical fiscal impulses. But some may be responded right now, 
particularly the cyclical or structural nature of recent fiscal improvements. This paper by Christian Daude, Ángel Melguizo and Alejandro Neut, economists of the 
OECD Development Centre, contributes to this relevant debate: fiscal solvency is a precondition 
for sustainable development policies, and the ability to have a counter-cyclical policy is an 
important tool to support the poor and vulnerable during downturns. The paper analyses fiscal 
policy in the main economies in Latin America during the last two decades. It uses the OECD 
methodology to measure structural balances, but it also takes into account the central role that 
commodities play in several countries in the region. All in all, underneath the observed positive 
indicators, the analysis of cyclically-adjusted balances and debt sustainability confirms that most 
countries were in better position before the crisis. However, tax automatic stabilisers in Latin 
America are still small, around half the OECD average. Concerning discretionary fiscal impulses, 
they continue to be broadly pro-cyclical, but in some countries policy response to the last cycle 
has been more stabilising. Finally, the authors document a great degree of uncertainty 
concerning output gap estimates in Latin America which – combined with wide commodity 
cycles – add an extra layer of complexity for policy makers in the region. This paper is elaborated within the Fiscal pillar of the LAC-OECD Initiative  " Fiscal 
Policy: Improving Taxation and Public Expenditure " , a joint project of the Centre for Tax Policy 
and Administration and the Development Centre, supported by Spain, Chile and Mexico. We 
hope that this working paper will contribute to a better informed debate on fiscal policy, helping 
ultimately to improve the wellbeing of the people in Latin America. Mario Pezzini Director OECD Development Centre July 2010 Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last?

DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 7 ABSTRACT This paper analyses fiscal policy for several economies in Latin America, from the early 
nineties to the 2009 crisis. We present original estimates of cyclically-adjusted public revenues for 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay implementing the 
standardised OECD methodology and extending it to include commodity cycles, which have a 
direct and significant effect on the fiscal balance of several Latin American countries. Based on 
these estimates, we evaluate the size of automatic tax stabilisers and the cyclicality of 
discretionary fiscal policy. Additionally, we highlight the uncertainty stemming from the 
estimation of the output gap, due to large and simultaneous cyclical, temporary and permanent 
shocks in several Latin American economies. JEL Classification: E62; H30; H60

DEV/DOC(2010)8 8 © OECD 2010 I. INTRODUCTION In reaction to the 2009 global financial crisis, most industrialised and several emerging 
economies enacted Keynesian-type fiscal packages (from personal income tax cuts and indirect 
taxes reductions, to higher infrastructure spending and transfers to local governments, families, 
and firms) to mitigate the collapse of domestic demand. Several Latin American economies faced the international crisis on relatively solid 
domestic macroeconomic grounds, both monetary and fiscal. On the fiscal front, most countries 
in the region displayed higher budget surpluses and lower debt-to-GDP levels, giving them 
apparently unprecedented fiscal margins to pursue sustainable counter-cyclical fiscal policies, of 
a similar size of those in OECD countries (see OECD, 2009b) 1 . But, is Latin America's resilience in 2009 a permanent change in paradigm? The success of 
these counter-cyclical fiscal policy responses in Latin American economies is still unclear, and 
will largely depend on both the size of the programmes actually implemented (generally smaller 
and with greater lags than announced) and their effective impact (opening, once again, the 
debate on multipliers). Besides, at the wake of the international financial crisis there was no 
consensus on the cyclical or structural nature of still recent fiscal improvements 
2 . Our paper joins the latter debate. In section two we present updated original estimates of 
cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances for a number of Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. We track these balances since the early 
nineties to 2009, implementing the standardised OECD methodology (Girouard and André, 2005, 
and Van den Noord, 2000), but adding the fiscal impact of commodity prices (following basically 
the IMF approach in Vladkova and Zettelmeyer, 2008). With these estimates, we can then 
measure the size of automatic stabilisation tax policies and the size and cyclicality of discretional 
fiscal policy. These measures are compared with those in OECD countries and used to discuss 1 This strength was in stark contrast with previous episodes. See Gavin and Perotti (1997) and Gavin and Hausmann (1008) for Latin America, and Talvi and Vegh (2005), Kaminsky et al. (2006), and Ilzetzki and 
Vegh (2008) for emerging markets in general. 
2 Izquierdo and Talvi (2008), from the Inter-American Development Bank, argued that if revenues from the seven largest economies in Latin America countries were adjusted using the implicit Hodrick-Prescott 
filter parameter for Chile (i.e. the smoothing coefficient on revenues that would render a structural 
surplus of one per cent of GDP since 2001), structural fiscal balances in the region, with the exception of 
Chile, did not differ significantly from their situation at the onset of the 1998 Russian crisis. Using a 
different methodological approach, Vladkova-Hollar and Zettelmeyer (2008), from the International 
Monetary Fund, observed an improvement in structural balances in most countries, although they 
point out that commodity prices added a significant layer of uncertainty. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 9 the cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy in the region, differentiating countries and periods. 
Additionally, based on these numbers we perform standard debt sustainability exercises. The 
third section explains the methodology used to estimate the output gap. We opt for an 
unobserved components model to decompose shocks into permanent, cyclical and transitory. 
Section four concludes, underlining the importance of output gap estimates, the inclusion of 
commodity prices and the consideration of automatic fiscal responses in the design of 
sustainable fiscal policies over the business cycle in the region. Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 10 © OECD 2010 II. CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED BUDGET BALANCES IN LATIN AMERICA II.1. OECD approach to estimation of cyclically-adjusted fiscal revenues As a starting point, we apply the OECD approach to account for the automatic impact of 
the business cycle on public accounts, as presented in detail by Girouard and Andre (2005) for 
OECD countries, and De Mello and Moccero (2006) for Brazil. This method computes separately 
the cyclical component of unemployment-related transfers and of public receipts from four types 
of taxes: personal income tax (PIT), social security contributions (SSC), and corporate income tax 
(CIT), and indirect taxes (IT), and of unemployment-related transfers. Focusing on public revenues, the cyclical response of tax i to the business cycle (labelled ε ti,,y) is calculated as the product of two elasticities: the elasticity of tax receipts to the tax base (labelled ε ti,,tbi) and the elasticity of the tax base to the economic cycle (labelled ε tbi,,y): ε ti,,y = ε ti,,tbi × ε tbi,,y (1) where i covers the four taxes mentioned above (PIT, SSC, CIT or IT) or their respective tax bases 
(wage bill for the first two, corporate profits and consumption). On the expenditure side, the adjustment is usually made at the level of total primary 
spending as time-series data on unemployment-related expenditure are not available across 
countries. Girouard and Andre (2005) use several OECD instruments, publications and 
databases, especially the Annual National Accounts, the Economic Outlook database, national Labour 
Force Surveys, the Taxing Wages model, and Revenue Statistics. Next, we describe the methodology 
more in depth while explaining the approach we follow for Latin American economies. Personal income tax and social security contributions To calculate the elasticity of income tax and social security contributions with respect to 
the tax base, the marginal and the average tax rates of a representative household are calculated 
for several points in the earnings distribution: from 0.5 to 3.0 times the average production 
worker in each OECD country. A representative household is defined as a full-time, two-earner 
married couple with two children, with the secondary earner receiving 50 per cent of the wage of 
the principal earner. Effective tax rates are computed using the OECD Taxing Wages simulator, 
while the distribution of tax payers across income levels in each country are based on labour 
market statistics (based on median, first and ninth deciles incomes taken from Labour Force 
Surveys). The overall elasticities of both PIT and SSC with respect to the tax base (ε ti,,tbi) are 
calculated as the weighted ratios of marginal and average tax rates: OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291

ε (2) where γi is the share of earners i in the income distribution, MAi is the marginal income tax rate 
or social security contribution rate at earning level i, and AVi stands for the corresponding 
average rate. Due to the lack of comparable databases and instruments, this procedure poses 
significant challenges when applying them to Latin America. We proxy the distribution of 
potential tax payers using the latest available National Household Surveys 
3 in Argentina (referred to 2006), Brazil (2006) 4 , Chile (2006), Colombia (2008), Costa Rica (2006), Mexico (2006), 
Peru (2006), and Uruguay (2005). In particular, we calculate the 'adjusted first earner income' 
distribution taking into account household composition (if two earners exist, the first earner is 
assigned two thirds of household income while second earner is assigned the rest). We restrict 
our analysis to labour income (dependent and self-employed workers) 5 , and limit the sample to 
households with at least some labour income 
6 . Given the high levels of informality and income inequality in the region, we analyze an extended income interval, covering from 0.05 times 
average income (i.e. almost from the first peso/sol/real of labour income) to more than six times 
average income. Figure 1 represents the average adjusted income level and those corresponding to the first 
and ninth deciles, corrected by purchasing power parities. Average annual labour income level 
ranges from 7.700 $ PPP in Peru, to nearly 14.600 $ PPP in Chile. Workers in the ninth decile earn 
more than twice the average in all countries, while low earners vary significantly (in Peru, those 
in the first decile earn 20 times less than the average income, while only five times less in Costa 
Rica). 3 Encuesta Permanente de Hogares in Argentina, Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios in Brazil, Encuesta de 
Caracterización Socioeconómica Nacional in Chile, Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares in Colombia, Encuesta 
de Hogares y Propósitos Múltiples in Costa Rica, Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo in Mexico, 
Encuesta Nacional de Hogares in Peru and Encuesta Continua de Hogares in Uruguay. We are aware of the 
potential limitations from using survey data, in contrast to administrative records, but, on the other 
hand, household surveys are more generally available. As a future extension of this research, we will 
test the robustness of the results using alternative income distribution sources. 4 Brazil is included to establish a link between previous OECD research and our regional analysis. In the 
following sections we will report analysis based on elasticities calculated by De Mello and Moccero 
(2006). 
5 As already established in the OECD method, this does not represent a significant bias for Latin America, since capital income is usually not taxed by the personal income tax. 
6 According to our calculations based on the National Household Surveys, between 8 and 26 per cent of households in the selected Latin American countries do report no labour income (26.1 in Argentina, 
15.6 in Brazil, 11.4 in Chile, 11.5 in Colombia, 15.0 in Costa Rica, 7.7 in Mexico, 9.2 in Peru, and 22.0 in 
Uruguay). Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 12 © OECD 2010 Focusing on the distribution of labour income earners, the analysis shows a high 
concentration of workers below the average labour income: between 60 and 70 per cent of labour 
income earners earn less than the national average (Figure 2). The Peruvian income distribution 
represents an outlier, given the concentration of income earners at lower levels. This fact has a 
very significant impact on the number of effective tax payers and fiscal revenues. Figure 1. Adjusted first earner annual labour income (PPP dollars) 0.0 3,000.0 6,000.0 9,000.0 12,000.0 15,000.0 18,000.0 21,000.0 24,000.0 27,000.0 30,000.0 ARG 2006

7 . Chilean and Uruguayan figures were provided by the respective Ministries of Finance, while Mexican rates were calculating using the OECD 
Taxing Wages simulator. For other countries, we calculated the fiscal figures based on the 
legislation in place during the corresponding fiscal year. Calculations are referred to 2006, because several of the household surveys available are 
from that year, and as it corresponds to a relatively neutral year in cyclical terms (in the case of 
Colombia, we deflated the data referred to 2008 with the national CPI). The only exception is 
Uruguay, in which we updated survey figures with observed CPI up to 2009 to incorporate the 
new personal income tax established in 2008. In those cases where fiscal legislation allows 
individual and household declaration, we chose the one more beneficial to tax payers, including 
allowances for both espouse and children, if existing

Source: Authors' calculations based on OECD Taxing Wages (Mexico), Ministries of Finance (Chile and

times the average in Uruguay, to 11 times in Chile). 
8 Tax declarations are at the individual level in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay, and by households in Argentina, Costa Rica and Mexico. Argentina and Mexico figures incorporate spouse and children 
allowances. Brazilian figures, taken from De Mello and Moccero (2006), are on an individual basis. 
Therefore, we fix both income distribution and tax legislation, as stated in the OECD methodology. As a 
future extension, we plan to test the effects on tax elasticities of changes in the tax code, and of 
variations of income distribution. Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 14 © OECD 2010 As shown in Figure 4, the personal income tax in all these Latin American countries is 
formally progressive, since average tax rates increase with income levels. Second, with the 
exception of Mexico (due to the interaction of exempted income, individual declarations and tax 
credits), labour income earners are net payers of the PIT starting at levels ranging from the 
average income in Chile to three times the average income in Colombia. Together with 
informality, these high levels imply that only a small share of households with labour income is a 
net PIT payer. Figure 4. Average personal income tax by income levels (Percentage) 0.00 5.00 10.00 15.00 20.00 25.00 30.00 0 . 1

Source: Authors' calculations based on OECD Taxing Wages (Mexico), Ministries of Finance (Chile and

even slightly regressive given the existence of minimum contributions in Mexico. Chile and 
Mexico are the only two countries with a fully privatised pension system, where social 
contributions mainly finance health benefits 
9 . As defined in equation (2), the wage elasticity of PIT and SSC is calculated as the ratio 
between the weighted marginal tax rate, and the weighted average tax rate (included in fifth and 
sixth columns in Table 1). With the exception of Mexico, PIT elasticities are between 2.5 and 3.3. 
These levels are higher than those observed in OECD countries, and slightly lower than the 3.4 
found for Brazil in De Mello and Moccero (2006). In other words, formal progressivity of the PIT 
is higher in Latin America. On the other hand, SSC elasticities are very much in line with OECD 
estimates, except Mexico and Colombia, where they are significantly lower. 9 Mexican contributions cover sickness, disability and nursery, while Chilean rates cover health and unemployment. In the other cases contributions finance both health and pensions. In the case of parallel 
public-private compulsory pension systems (Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay), we assumed 
that the worker is affiliated to the public scheme. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291

Source: Authors' calculations based on OECD Taxing Wages (Mexico), Ministries of Finance (Chile and

the sensitivity of the relevant tax bases with respect to the output gap (ε tbi,,y). As in Girouard and 
André (2005), the cyclical sensitivity of the wage base (PIT and SSC tax base) has been estimated 
using an equation that links directly the cyclical component of the wage bill to the output gap. 
We regress the share of the real wage bill in potential GDP (constructed with active population 
from the Penn World tables, and unemployment and urban workers wages from ECLAC) on the 
output gap (estimated using unobserved components model on real chained GDP series from 
Penn World tables as described in section III) and a constant, in logs with annual data from 1981 
to 2007 (see details in Annex). t

and Moccero (2006) for Brazil, and Girouard and André (2005) for the rest Finally, we multiply both elasticities to obtain the overall tax elasticities. Table 2 collects 
the output elasticity of PIT and SSC in our selected Latin American countries, compared to those 
in selected OECD economies and Brazil. Given the higher elasticities of the wage bill to output 
gap, output elasticities of PIT are much larger in Latin America than those observed in OECD 
countries (3.5 on average vs. 1.2), and less in the case of SSC elasticities (1.2 on average vs. 0.7). Corporate income tax Concerning corporate taxes, we strictly apply the OECD methodology. Therefore, the 
cyclical sensitivity of the corporate tax base (proxied by corporate profits) is also a function of the 
elasticity of the wage bill relative to the output. ε CIT,,y = (1-(1-PS) ε wl,,y )PS (4) where PS is the profit share in output proxied by the ratio of the gross operating surplus over GDP, and ε wl,,y is the elasticity of the wage bill to the output gap. Profit shares over GDP are taken from OECD Annual National Accounts in the case of Chile, from the national central banks 
in Costa Rica and Uruguay, and from national statistics institutes in Argentina (INDEC), 
Colombia (DANE), Mexico (INEGI) and Peru (INEI). As shown in Table 3, output elasticities of 
CIT vary from 0.3 in Costa Rica to 1.2 in Uruguay, therefore lower than in OECD countries. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291

Moccero (2006) for Brazil, and Girouard and André (2005) for the rest. Output elasticity of wages in Colombia 
is taken from Lozano and Toro (2007) Other revenues, expenditures and overall balance The output elasticity of the indirect tax base with respect to the economic cycle is set to 
unity for all countries, as in Girouard and André (2005). Finally, due to the lack of data and given 
the absence of unemployment benefits in many countries in the region, we suppose that current 
expenditures do not respond automatically to the cycle at all. The cyclical budget response, as a share of GDP, can be expressed as the weighted sum of 
the four different tax revenues elasticities (based on the tax structure in 2006; see Table A.1 in the 
Annex). According to our calculations, the sensitivity (semi elasticity in GDP percentage points) 
of government budget balances to a 1 percentage point change in the output gap is 0.21 
(unweighted average of the six Latin American economies), ranging from 0.12 in Mexico and 0.14 
in Colombia, to 0.24 in Argentina and Uruguay, 0.25 in Brazil (De Mello and Moccero, 2006), and 
0.26 in Costa Rica. This regional average is almost half the OECD average, and is explained by 
significantly lower automatic stabilisation from PIT (Figure 6). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291

industrialised economies (see for instance Gali, 1994 and Fatas and Mihov, 2001). Nonetheless, as 
shown in Figure 7, some of the biggest economies in Latin America (notably Brazil, Colombia

significantly lower than the government size (in part due to the high non-tax revenues). Figure 7. Government size and tax automatic stabilisers in OECD and Latin America (Percentage points of GDP) 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.10

DEV/DOC(2010)8 20 © OECD 2010 II.2. Adjustment of tax and non-tax revenues for commodity prices A special feature of several Latin American countries is the importance of commodity 
prices for its fiscal accounts, whether it is due to a significant share of taxation linked to rents in 
natural resource extraction, or the utilities of state-owned enterprises in these sectors. Not only 
are commodity-linked revenues important as a source of revenue, but they also tend to be very 
volatile, primarily due to large fluctuations in prices. Therefore, they are also relevant for fiscal 
sustainability and macroeconomic stability (Avendaño et al., 2008) 
10 . Figure 8 shows copper revenues as a share of GDP in Chile from 1990 to 2009. Copper 
revenues during this period have risen from less than 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1999 up to more 
than 12 per cent of GDP in 2006. Compared with total revenues, these revenues are more than 
five times more volatile (copper revenues have a coefficient of variation of 1.01 versus 0.18 for 
total revenues). Thus, it is necessary to separate this source of income in countries where 
commodities are important for fiscal revenues and perform a special adjustment for commodity 
price fluctuations. Figure 8. Copper revenues as share of GDP and the price of copper

Copper-related Revenues/GDP (rhs) Source: Authors' calculations based on DIPRES and COCHILCO data 10 These authors show that the macroeconomic response to the latest Asian-driven commodity boom of exporting countries in Africa and Latin America has been fairly positive. In contrast to the nineties, 
during 2000-2005 African commodity-exporters have shown a more counter-cyclical fiscal stance, 
displaying various positive macroeconomic developments (notably, reserves accumulation, exports 
diversification, and improved credit profile). Results are more modest in Latin America. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 21 Unfortunately, the OECD methodology is silent regarding this issue. 
11 Therefore, we follow a similar methodology to the Chilean fiscal rule (see Marcel et al., 2001 and Rodríguez et 
al., 2007) and recent IMF work on this topic in Latin America and the Caribbean (e.g. Vladkova-
Hollar and Zettelmeyer, 2008). The adjustment is made for Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru. 12 
In Argentina, we consider export taxes on agricultural goods introduced in 2002. For Chile, we 
consider revenues transferred to the central government from the public copper company 
(CODELCO) and revenues from specific taxes on private mining firms. 13 In the case of Mexico, 
we use international oil price data to adjust the value of transfers from the public oil firm 
(PEMEX) to the federal government, royalties and revenues of specific taxes on oil and petrol 
derivatives. It is important to point out that there are differences – due to data availability 
restrictions – between how we treat public enterprises in the commodity sector for Chile and 
Mexico. While for Chile we consider the general government, which implies that we do consider 
only the transfers and income taxes paid by CODELCO, for Mexico we used the non-financial 
public sector. Finally, in the case of Peru, we consider royalties and income taxes of the mining 
and fishing industries, adjusted by a weighted average (according to their share in revenues) of 
international copper, gold and fishmeal prices. In Annex A.3 we present more details on the 
series and data sources. In terms of the adjustment, we first separate revenues (tax and non-tax) into revenues 
related to commodities and non-commodity revenues. The latter are adjusted as indicated in the 
section II.1 by the business cycle. For commodity-related revenues, we proceed as follows. 
Considering a spot price of p and a long-run price of the relevant commodity price p * , structural 
commodity-linked revenues at time t are given by: γ  

(5) As Marcel et al. (2001) and Vladkova-Hollar and Zettelmeyer (2008), we consider a 
unitary elasticity, such that γ = 1. For p * , we considered four different options, depending on 
available information: future prices, five-year-ahead forecasts, a 10-year moving average or a 
reference price set by a panel of experts (the case of copper in Chile). As shown in Figure 9 for 
the case of copper, a 10-year moving average coincides roughly with the forecasts of the experts' 
panel, with the exception of 2009. For the latest year, it seems that experts consider a larger 
fraction of the recent rise in copper prices to be persistent. We discard future markets, as they 11 For Norway, OECD exercises are carried out using Norway-mainland fiscal and national accounts that exclude the oil and natural gas sector in a consistent way. There is no such information available for 
Mexico or Chile. 
12 Commodity prices are also important in the other countries studied here, but their impact on the fiscal accounts is mainly through the business cycle rather than an autonomous effect for these economies. 
For the case of Colombia, it is important to point out that energy and mining related revenues represent 
close to 1 per cent of GDP, but are expected to play an important role in the near future (see Comité 
Técnico Interinstitucional, 2010). 
13 Although other metals like molybdenum, gold and silver are also produced in Chile, copper remains by far the most important source of revenues. Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 22 © OECD 2010 prove to be relatively small and shallow (probably with the exception of oil futures), and prices 
tend to be very volatile. In what follows, we report our results based on the 10-year moving 
average price. Commodity revenues are not separately adjusted by the output gap, given that 
commodity prices are already significantly linked to the business cycle. Figure 9. Copper prices (US dollars cents/pound) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 1998

Experts Panel Reference Price Source: Authors' calculations based on data from Cochilco and London Metal Exchange As shown in of Table 4, as of 2007 a large fraction of observed revenues linked to 
commodities were likely to be transitory. For Chile, around two thirds of the 11.2 percentage 
points of GDP linked to copper revenues were due to copper prices above its long-run price. The 
results for Argentina and Peru indicate that around half of commodity revenues could be 
considered transitory in 2007, although the absolute magnitudes are smaller than for Chile or 
Mexico. For the case of Mexico, it would be around one third of the oil revenues that are linked 
to the oil price cycle (almost 4 percentage points of GDP). This table also shows that the global 
economic crisis, and the consequent decline in commodity prices due to the collapse of global 
demand, had an important effect on some of the commodity-linked revenues in the region, but 
the effect is not homogenous. In fact, while in 2009 commodity revenues in Chile declined 
significantly, in the other three countries the effect was considerably milder. II.3. Main results Including all these elements and using the share of each tax on GDP for general 
governments from ELAC-ILPES and IDB public sector databases of 2006 (except for Colombia 
and Uruguay, where we used central government data for 2006 and 2008 respectively), we can

Adjusted Notes: Primary budget balance is adjusted for deviations of GDP and commodity prices (for Argentina, Chile,

DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 25 According to our estimates, at the onset of the crisis, adjusted primary balances were in 
equilibrium or surplus in a majority of countries (1 p.p of GDP in Peru, 2 p.p. in Uruguay, 
2.5 p.p. in Brazil, almost 3 p.p. in Chile and Colombia, and 5 p.p. in Costa Rica; -1.0 p.p. in 
Argentina and -3.6 p.p. in Mexico). So, even taking into account the positive economic and 
commodity price cycles, these figures confirm that the region faced the crisis in relatively good 
shape. The figure also highlights the significant impact of the economic cycle; especially in 
Argentina and Uruguay (automatic stabilisers via revenue contributed more than 4 p.p. of GDP 
to sustain aggregate demand). Finally, commodity prices (copper, gold and oil) contributed 
significantly to improve fiscal positions in latest years (around 1 p.p. in Argentina, 2 p.p. in 
Mexico, 3 p.p. in Peru and over 6 p.p. in Chile). Obviously, 2009 figures reflect a generalised 
deterioration, driven by cyclical, commodity related and discretionary factors 
14 . Next, we explore the pro-cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy in the standard way, 
comparing the variation of the adjusted primary balance and the output gap level. Fiscal policy is 
defined as counter-cyclical if the surplus increases (deficit decreases) in a year with positive 
output gap, or if the deficit increases (surplus decreases) when the output gap is negative. As 
represented in Figure 11, in the last two decades discretionary fiscal policy in Latin America has 
tended to be pro-cyclical (the correlation coefficient is –0.37 and in more than 60 per cent of cases, 
53 out of the 144 cases, discretionary fiscal policy was not stabilising). Figure 11. Output gap and change in adjusted budget balance

Variation of cyclically adjusted primary balance Output gap Source: Authors' calculations 14 2009 budget figures are preliminary for many economies. Data for Argentina, Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru where taken from the respective Central Bank databases, for Mexico and Uruguay from Ministry 
of Finance databases, and Brazil and Chile from OECD Economic Outlook projections (May 2010). Access 
to stable funding (both internal and external) determined the size of announced fiscal packages in the 
region. Chile and Peru were the top performers in the  " fiscal resilience index " constructed by the OECD 
(2009b); an index that takes into account the external debt to exports ratio (a standard fiscal solvency 
indicator), the financing cost of fiscal expansions (proxied by the JP Morgan's EMBI Global spreads), 
and the government's pre-crisis budget balance with respect to GDP. Not coincidentally, these two 
countries announced and implemented the biggest fiscal stimuli for 2009. Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 26 © OECD 2010 From a national perspective, no country has benefited from sustained countercyclical 
discretionary fiscal policy, and in all cases, countries show a majority of pro-cyclical fiscal 
impulses (the most favourable cases are Brazil and Mexico, with 46 and 47 per cent of stabilising 
episodes, respectively). In spite of that, based on the correlations of the variation of the adjusted 
budget balance and output gap level, Chile shows to some extent a countercyclical patter (0.35), 
while in Colombia and Peru discretionary fiscal policy has been fairly neutral (coefficients of 
correlation of 0.01 and -0.07 respectively). Argentina and Uruguay show the highest pro-
cyclically, driven mainly by the impact and policy response to the 2002 crisis (if this episode is 
excluded, Uruguayan fiscal policy has been fairly neutral). Additionally, we find no clear 
progress in this field in the last decade. From 2000, fiscal policy has been more pro-cyclical (-0.49 
from 2000 vs. -0.22 from 1990 to 1999) or as pro-cyclical at best (-0.18 when controlling for the 
2002 crisis). With these criteria, good practices stem again from Costa Rica, where discretionary 
fiscal policy has turned counter-cyclical, and Chile (where it was maintained throughout the 
period analysed). We also test whether these results are symmetric along the economic cycle. Using this 
simplified approach, discretionary fiscal policy seems to be more pro-cyclical in the crisis, when 
output gap remains negative (correlation of -0.44) than in booms (-0.15). So, apparently, the pro-
cyclicality of fiscal policy in the region is not explained by the existence of profligate 
governments, but with either internally or externally credit rationed countries, as dramatically 
shown in 2002 crisis, where a huge fiscal adjustment was implemented in a deep crisis 
environment in Argentina and Uruguay. Excluding this big shock, no significant difference 
remains between booms and (regular) busts, an issue that should be borne in mind when setting 
fiscal rules and institutions. Of course, if the fiscal authorities in the country are aware of the 
potential impact of such large negative shocks, one could still make the argument that it would 
be optimal to save more during the good times. However, when it comes to design fiscal rules, it 
is important to take into account that emerging markets might lose exogenously access to finance 
during times of turmoil. While the main focus of this paper is on the cyclicality of fiscal policy in Latin America 
and the estimation of structural balances, the issue of fiscal sustainability has been of importance 
for the region, given its recurrent debt problems. Overall, in recent times there has been a 
reduction of debt-to-GDP levels in the region. However, there are considerable differences 
within the region. On the one hand, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico (after the  " tequila crisis " ), and 
Peru reduced their debt-to-GDP levels over the last decade and more. Peru and Chile had debt 
levels of almost 80 per cent of GDP in the early 1990s, while nowadays exhibit levels around 
25 per cent of GDP. Less pronounced, but still significant, has been the debt burden reductions in 
Costa Rica and Mexico from close to 50 per cent of GDP in the mid-1990s to less than 30 per cent 
in 2008. On the other hand, Argentina and Uruguay have suffered both a debt crisis during the 
collapse of their fixed exchange rate regimes and associated banking crises in 2001-2002. Since 
then, in part due to debt restructuring, but also due to economic growth and fiscal surpluses they 
have reduced their debt levels down to around 50 per cent of GDP, which are higher levels than 
ten years ago. Brazil is closer to the case of Argentina and Uruguay, with still high levels of debt 
(at least in gross terms) and a somewhat slower reduction than the first group. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 27 Debt sustainability depends on a series of factors such as long-term economic growth 
perspectives, the cost of funds (interest rate), and the composition of debt; but also things much 
harder to measure such as expectations (Calvo, 1988) and institutional/political characteristics 
affecting a country's ability and willingness to service its sovereign debt. Furthermore, 
exogenous shocks to each of these variables are hard to identify, making debt sustainability 
analysis a challenging topic. Therefore, in this section we explore some aspects of debt dynamics 
in the region using standard techniques in the literature, rather than making a precise judgement 
regarding the need and size of fiscal adjustment in each country. Although it is not obvious how to establish a benchmark for safe debt levels, one way to 
approach this issue is to compute the primary surplus required to stabilise debt to GDP ratios at 
their current level, and compare this required surplus with both actual and structural balances. Given the government budget dynamics in equation (7), fiscal policy is considered 
sustainable if the primary surplus (S) is greater than the primary surplus required to stabilise the 
debt level (D) relative to GDP (Y): 1

(9) It should be recognised that this definition has some limitations. First, it does not say 
anything regarding the initial debt-to-GDP ratio, which might be too high and therefore an 
additional fiscal effort to reduce it to a safe level would be required. Second, this 'accounting 
approach' does not consider underlying correlations and endogeneity of variables. For instance, 
in the presence of default risk, interest rates would increase with the debt burden and with net 
financing needs if liquidity risks are also present. Growth could in turn depend negatively on the 
cost of funding (r) and the debt burden (if there is a debt overhang problem, where private 
investment is lower because economic agents incorporate the prospects of higher future taxes to 
service the debt). In addition, valuation effects can have very important quantitative effects, as most 
countries in the region have painfully learnt during the 1980s and 1990s (debt dollarization). In Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 28 © OECD 2010 particular, swings in the real exchange rate often imply large fluctuations in the debt-to-GDP 
ratio, if the fraction of dollarised debt is different from the share of tradable goods in GDP. 15 Observe that the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio can be written as: Y eD 
B 
d * +

(10) where e is the relative price of tradable goods in terms of one unit of output, D* is debt 
denominated in tradables (dollars) and B in output units. The right-hand-side of equation (10) 
can be written as: Y D 
Y B φ + ,

(12) where D D 
e *

equation (13), will also be higher, given that a depreciation of the currency vis-à-vis the dollar 
would be expected in the transition to the steady state. Vice versa, if the currency is depreciated 
(above the equilibrium exchange rate), the adjusted debt level will be less than the observed one. d

(13) In practical terms, we measure the equilibrium real exchange rate to be measured by the 
average bilateral real exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar, considering CPI prices over the 
period 1990 – 2008. Furthermore, as proxy for the share of foreign currency debt in total debt, we 
use data on the markets where debt was issued, assuming that all external debt is in US dollars 
and all domestic debt is indexed to the domestic price level (which we assume to equal the GDP 
deflator; this is the implicit assumption in equations 11 – 13). A final adjustment refers to point in the cycle at which GDP stands, given that the debt-

OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 29 Before computing the required fiscal surpluses, it is useful to explore the relevance of 
these adjustments. Figure 12 shows the potential importance of these adjustments from a 
quantitative point of view for the case of Uruguay. Debt levels as a ratio of GDP in the late 1990s 
were slightly below 30 per cent of GDP. However, when taking into account the appreciation of 
the real exchange rate with respect to its long-term average, debt levels would have been ten 
percentage points of GDP higher. The opposite is true for 2002, where the observed debt-to-GDP 
ratio shot up to over 100 per cent of GDP, while it would have been around 76 per cent of GDP if 
debt was valued at the long-term real exchange rate, and almost 16 p. p. of GDP less if it were 
taken into account that the Uruguayan economy was in a deep crisis with GDP far below its 
potential (almost 20 per cent, according to our estimates). Finally, regarding the large reduction 
in the debt-to-GDP ratio after the crisis of more than 50 percentage points of GDP between 2002 
and 2009, our structural measure of debt was reduced by 7.7 percentage points until 2008, but 
increased in 2009 to reach similar levels as in 2002. Thus, most of the reduction in the debt-to-
GDP ratio could be attributed to the rebound in economic growth and the appreciation of the 
real exchange rate in the aftermath of the devaluation of the currency. Figure 12. Debt dynamics and the real exchange rate in Uruguay

16 As discussed above, in 2009, most countries present a considerably lower structural balance in 2009 than in 
previous years, given the automatic and discretionary fiscal expansion in response to the 
economic crisis. However, all countries (except Argentina) have been able during the last decade 
to exhibit fiscal balances above those required to sustain their current debt levels, such that they 
could be expected to reverse expansionary policies without major difficulties. In terms of the

Source: Authors' calculations Argentina and Chile are the exceptions, with a difference of 3.9 and 3.7 p. p. of GDP, 
respectively. However, Argentina and Chile are in very different situations. First, Chile took 
discretionary measures with a fiscal impulse of around 5.6 p. p. of GDP (comparing 2007 with 
2009), while the impulse in Argentina was much smaller (1.3 p. p. of GDP). Thus, countercyclical 
fiscal policy was much stronger in Chile than Argentina. This impulse was taken from a very 
strong position (debt-to-GDP of only around 6 per cent of GDP) in Chile, which is also reflected 
in the low fiscal surplus required to balance debt levels at their current value; meanwhile 
Argentina requires a much higher fiscal primary surplus (and has higher levels of debt, 47.1 per 
cent of GDP, adjusting for the real exchange rate and the business cycle). In more general terms, 
the level of the structural balances (as well as the fiscal impulse during 2007 – 2009) is highly 
correlated with the initial debt position. Countries with higher levels of debt were in a more solid 
position to have higher structural deficits and larger fiscal impulses (the correlation coefficients 
with the debt levels are 0.90 and 0.48, respectively). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 31 III. ESTIMATION OF OUTPUT GAP Many researchers have recognised and analysed aggregate cycles in production without 
reaching consensus on its causes. 17 Lack of consensus regarding the theory is accompanied by an 
empirical problem; measurement of economic cycles depends on the estimation of potential 
output, which is unobservable. OECD methodology decomposes production through classical 
Solow factor decomposition of capital constructed though perpetual inventory methods, labour 
(hours worked) and multifactor productivity (MFP). Potential output is then constructed as the 
counter-factual production arising from full capital utilisation 18 , unemployment rate equal to the 
NAIRU, and MFP given by its long-run trend. Although we follow the above criteria to construct potential output in the Latin American 
countries, we could not follow OECD methodology by further disaggregating factors by their 
specific types, by the sectors of the economy where they are being used, or by their rate of 
utilization. In particular, restrictions on data availability for several Latin American countries 
forced us to construct capital from aggregate investment figures, using the perpetual inventory 
method with infinite lifespan and a constant depreciation rate of eight percent. Real investment, 
real GDP and active population data are chained series 
19 built from series in Penn World tables, which cover a span of nearly six decades, from 1950 to 2007. The series are extended up to 2013 
using IMF's World Economic Outlook estimates and forecast as of April 2010. 
20 The treatment of net exports, in real terms (volume) or in terms of its purchasing power (dollars), merits also some 
attention. While the first measure better reflects production dynamics, the latter better reflects 
change on income. We opt for the former measure of volume on two grounds: we keep 
consistency when we later decompose GDP using a production function, and we analyze the 17 This has lead economist to declare such aggregate behaviour dead in more than one occasion. The latest notable quote came in 2003 from Robert Lucas, who in his presidential address to the American Economic 
Association declared that 'the central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical 
purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades'. 
18 OECD latest revision to potential output uses total capital rather than a filtered series of such series (OECD, 2008). 
19 See OECD (2001) for the benefit of chained indices with respect to other bases of conversion, especially when looking at higher frequency data and avoiding level comparison across countries. 
20 Potential output is estimated up to 2009. But forecasts for years 2010 onwards are used as a way to circumvent well-known end point filter problems when estimating trends. GDP forecasts are provided 
by the IMF, while investment forecasts are estimated from those GDP forecasts, using simple regression 
of investment growth on GDP growth between 1990 and 2009. Fiscal Policy in Latin America: Countercyclical and Sustainable at Last? 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 32 © OECD 2010 effect of terms of trade on fiscal balance separately from the effect of the business cycle. Initial 
capital stock in 1950 is assumed to be on a balanced growth path, thus approximated by K 1950 = I 1950 / [(1 + g)(1 + n) − (1 − δ)] 
(15) where I 1950 is initial investment expenditure (filtered by a linear interpolation of the log 
investment throughout the 1950s), g is the average rate of technological progress on that same 
decade, and n is the corresponding average growth rate of active population. 
For the implicit Cobb-Douglas production function we assume a capital share of 0.5 for 
all countries. This is significantly different from the standard approximation of one third, but 
closer to the average obtained in the literature that covers emerging markets (see for example 
Gollin, 2002 for country–specific measures of this parameter for a wide range of countries). 
Given the broad level of aggregation, cyclical action will be centred in MFP. Several 
statistical studies have questioned the usual Hodrick-Prescott methodology to de-trend economic 
series, arguing that it is tailor-made for the output cycles in the US, but not necessarily optimal 
for any other type of economic series (see Harvey et al., 2008). Furthermore, there is ample 
evidence that emerging markets have a very different cyclical behaviour than industrialised 
economies, with some authors putting into question even the existence of cyclical shocks 
(e.g. Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007). 
To address some of these challenges posed in the literature, we de-trend the resulting 
MFP series using the unobserved components model suggested by Harvey (1998). We use this 
state-space estimation method to estimate unexpected shocks to the MFP series, decomposing 
these shocks into three components: shocks that have a permanent effect on MFP, cyclical shocks 
with an estimated frequency, and time decay, and transitory 'white noise' shocks. Permanent 
shocks determine the trend while the two latter shocks determine the gap to potential output. 
Harvey (1989) shows that the Hodrick-Prescott filter can be obtained as a particular case of this 
method, by imposing two additional restrictions: no cyclical component and a predetermined 
ratio between the variance of transitory and permanent shocks (a ratio that coincides with the 
parameter lambda of HP filters). We define the logarithm of multifactor productivity a, and use the state-space domain to 
decompose the series into three unobserved components: a trend t, a cycle c, and a transitory 
shock ξι : 
a = t + c + ξι (16) 
The trend component accounts for permanent changes in the growth rate of (log) MFP, 
and is thus interpreted as the 'long run trend for multi factor productivity' in potential output. It is specified as growing with a stochastic drift µ : 
t = t−1 + γ ∆crisis + µ (17) where t−1 is the trend in the previous period and ∆crisis is a year dummy that account for large 
permanent MFP losses at the beginning of the 1980s debt crisis. The drift rate µ is assumed to follow a random walk: µ = µ−1 + β ∆crisis +ξµ (18) where the same 1980s dummy ∆crisis is used to account for any large permanent reduction in MFP's growth rates after the debt crisis. Thus, MFP trend grows at a rate that varies, but that at OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 33 any time t, is best forecasted as remaining constant and equal to current rate µ. The large recession in the early 1980s and the prolonged low growth that resulted call for adding the ∆crisis dummy, which proves to be significantly negative for both the level and rate of MFP trend. As 
countries felt the 1980s recession in different years (between 1981 and 1982), for each country we 
select the year dummy which maximises the log likelihood (following the AIC criteria). The cycle component c follows the autoregressive process: 
c = ρ cos(λ) c−1 + ρ sin(λ) c*−1 + ξχ (19) c* = −ρ sin(λ) c−1 + ρ cos(λ) c*−1 + ξχ *  (20) where ξχ and ξχ *  are disturbances with equal variance. The period of the cycle is 2π /λ. The damping factor ρ with 0 < ρ < 1 ensures that c is a stationary ARMA (2, 1) process with complex roots in the autoregressive part. It is assumed that all disturbances are normally distributed and 
are independent of each other (usual assumption to assure the identification of the parameters). 
Initial values for the stationary cycle components are given by the unconditional distribution and 
for the non-stationary trend and drift components by a diffuse prior. The filtered and smoothed 
values of the unobserved components are generated by the Kalman filter. 
Estimated parameters for the temporary, cyclical and trend components vary significantly 
across countries. Figure 13 shows the variance decomposition of unexpected shocks in each period (ξµ +ξχ + ξι ). While Uruguay has the largest estimated total variance, its shocks are mostly cyclical. The figure also shows that long term estimated shocks to the trend in Chile, Costa Rica, 
Peru and Uruguay have a statistically significant variance. As expected, even for these countries, 
this variance is significantly smaller than the estimated variance of the two stationary shocks; a 
fact that translates into a relatively smooth long-term trend. Though smaller in size than the 
stationary shocks, trend shocks follow a random walk. Thus their effect is cumulative and large 
after several periods. Figure 13. Estimated variance decomposition of shocks to log MFP 0.0000 0.0002 0.0004 0.0006 0.0008 0.0010 0.0012 0.0014 Uruguay

Stochastic Cycle Source: Author's calculation Table 6 shows the estimated damping factor and the estimated period 2/ for the 
stochastic cycle componentt Uruguay shows the longest stochastic cycles (averaging 15 years) 
while Mexico and Peru show the shortest cycles (averaging 9 years). Brazil's estimated cycles are OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291 
DEV/DOC(2010)8 OECD 2010 35 the closest to the 'biblical cycle' of 14 years. The damping factor for Costa Rica is the strongest 
with equal to 0.24 (i.e., the cyclical shock is dampened to a fourth of its size by the following year), while Mexico exhibits the weakest dampening effect with an estimated ρ equal to 0.93 (i.e. it takes 19 years for the cyclical shock to be dampened to a fourth of its size). In Mexico, the high estimated value of ρ, combined with the low estimated variance of cyclical shocks, implies a very stable 'almost non-stochastic' cycle. Table 6.

DEV/DOC(2010)8 36 © OECD 2010 IV. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS This paper aims to contribute to the debate on fiscal policy in Latin America by 
measuring cyclicality of fiscal balances using a common methodology. At the onset of the 
international financial crisis in 2008-2009, many indicators suggested that Latin American 
economies were facing the crisis in a much better macroeconomic position that in the past; with 
positive budget surpluses, lower debt-to-GDP levels and a more credible monetary policy thanks 
to inflation targeting regimes. Solid macro balances were the new reality in a region where fiscal 
fragility had been at the root of past protracted crises, such as the dramatic debt crisis of the 
1980s. We track fiscal balances since the early nineties for a set of Latin American economies, 
implementing both standardised cyclical-adjustment OECD methodology and regional specific 
adjustments for the impact of commodity prices. These estimations allow measuring the size of 
automatic stabilisers embedded in tax policies, and the cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy in 
the region as a whole. Additionally, we perform debt sustainability exercises to analyse how far 
from a potential benchmark current fiscal balances are. Our main messages can be summarised as follow. First, there is a great degree of 
uncertainty concerning output gap estimates in Latin America. Compounded with highly 
volatile cyclical shocks, there is evidence of highly volatile trends for potential output. Second, 
commodity cycles may be as relevant to countercyclical policy as economic cycles, because of the 
former's significance in total fiscal revenues. Third, tax automatic stabilisers are significant, 
although fairly small. Primary budget balances respond automatically around 0.2 p.p. for each 
percentage point of output gap in the region, half the OECD average (although with significant 
regional differences). Forth, since the early nineties, discretionary fiscal policy has been pro-
cyclical in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico and Uruguay, while neutral in Chile, Colombia 
and Peru. Fifth, pro-cyclicality of discretionary fiscal policy is probably explained by lack of 
access to credit during deep crises, rather than by profligate spending. And sixth, from a 
structural perspective, both cyclically-adjusted balances and debt sustainability analysis confirm 
the better position enjoyed by most countries in the region before the crisis. Venues for continuing research include lifting restrictions and understanding the 
implications of distinguishing cyclical and trend volatility. In a first stage, some hard 
assumptions we made to apply the OECD methodology may be relaxed, in particular the unitary 
elasticity of consumption taxes to the cycle, and the consideration of automatic stabilization via 
expenditure. Additionally, alternative data sources of the distribution of tax payers 
(administrative data) may be used as a robustness check of the results. Finally, it would be 
interesting to identify in the tax revenues series the effects of tax and social security reforms 
implemented since 1990, and to estimate their impact on elasticities. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 291
