			<p>Over the past decade progress has been made in assuring sustainable development and a better and<lb/> healthier life for Belgians (OECD, 2007a), but environmental performance is still often judged as<lb/> disappointing. 2 As further objectives are being set, the challenge for the coming years will be to meet them<lb/> in a cost-efficient way. This paper goes through the areas of environmental policies where the problems are<lb/> most pressing, starting from the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this energy intensive<lb/> economy. The slow development of renewable energy is also addressed in the context of climate change.<lb/> Air quality, a particular problem in the main cities, is reviewed within this context of GHG emissions due<lb/> to the interrelations between the two areas. Next, water pollution issues are discussed against the<lb/> background of years of failing to meet European standards, and the intensive use of water resources.<lb/> Finally, the division of environmental responsibilities is discussed, with the aim of assuring cost-efficient<lb/> policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>The greenhouse gas emission targets are becoming increasingly challenging<lb/></head>

			<p>Belgium, as many OECD countries, is likely to fulfil its Kyoto commitments for 2008-12 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> In the Kyoto protocol Belgium committed to a reduction of 2008-12 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions<lb/> by 7.5% with respect to 1990, slightly less than the EU15 overall target of –8%. The federal government<lb/> and the three regions signed an agreement specifying individual targets for each of them (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).<lb/> Together the regional targets yield a national reduction of emissions of 5.8% and the remainder is to be<lb/> achieved by the federal government through the so-called Kyoto flexible mechanisms, such as the purchase<lb/> of emission rights and emission-offsetting investments abroad. The regions may also use the flexible<lb/> mechanisms to achieve their targets. 3 The 2008-09 emissions have turned out significantly lower than<lb/> initially expected, owing to the drop in activity due to the global crisis – in particular low capacity<lb/> utilisation in industry and slower transport growth (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and</p>

According to WWF, Belgium&apos;s ecological footprint – a proxy for the<lb/> unsustainability of resource use – is the fourth highest in the world (WWF, 2010).<lb/> 3.<lb/> Regional governments can finance the purchase of carbon emission permits (on the EU ETS market) by<lb/> emitters, in excess of the allocated permits. In 2010, the Walloon government planned to finance permits<lb/> for a total of EUR 40-60 million for Arcelor Mittal to restart a blast furnace.<lb/> Looking forward, the climate change goals are becoming more ambitious. Within the EU&apos;s Climate<lb/> and Energy Package (so called 20/20/20, Box 1) Belgium has committed to targets, for 2020 and beyond,<lb/> by: participating in the EU&apos;s cap-and-trade Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), 4 adopting Belgian targets on<lb/></table>

It covers about 10 000 installations in the energy and<lb/> industrial sectors, which generate over 40% of GHG emissions in the countries concerned. Emission rights<lb/> are allocated according to internationally agreed national caps and within the country according to national<lb/> allocation plans (NAPs) – 96% through grandfathering. The Belgian NAP covers over 40% of projected<lb/> emissions: roughly 80% of industrial emissions and 97% of emissions from the energy sector. The NAP<lb/> reserves 8% of emission rights for new entrants. From 2012, the EU scheme will include air transport and<lb/> increase the emphasis on auctioning (over 50% of permits throughout 2013-20) over grandfathering.<lb/> reducing its non-ETS emissions by 15% (with respect to 2005) and increasing the share of renewable in<lb/> energy consumption to 13%. Additionally, Belgium has adopted a 2020 target of a reduction of primary<lb/> energy consumption by 18% with respect to a 2007 baseline. These targets appear challenging since the<lb/> baseline scenario (assuming no policy change) is an overall 13% increase in GHG emissions by 2020<lb/> relative to 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Bossier et al., 2008</ref>). The non-ETS segment is to see a 4% increase. More recent<lb/> estimates show that the crisis has slowed the increase in emissions (FPB, 2010), but even so the targets for<lb/> 2020 and beyond are unlikely to be fulfilled without substantial new measures.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the moment, in Belgium there is no clear national strategy on how the 20/20/20 goals are to be<lb/> achieved (Box 2), but it is likely that the governments will sign an internal agreement, as in the case of<lb/> Kyoto targets. If such an agreement will mean different ad hoc targets in each region, implying different<lb/> carbon prices, it will make abatement at minimum cost difficult, due to limited price equalisation<lb/> mechanisms for the non-ETS segment. Nationwide reduction strategies would be hence preferable.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. The European climate change targets for 2020 and beyond<lb/></head>

			<p>For 2020 and beyond, all EU countries committed under the climate and energy package (so called 20/20/20) to:<lb/> • Reducing EU-wide GHG emissions by 20% relative to 1990. This includes a 21% cut (relative to 2005) in<lb/> industries under the ETS and a 10% cut in non-ETS sectors (transport, residential, services and agriculture).<lb/> Each country has an individual target -Belgium committed to the new cuts under the ETS and to cutting<lb/> emissions by 15% in the non-ETS sectors.<lb/> • Doubling the overall EU share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 20% (10% specifically in<lb/> the transport sector). The Belgian commitment is to increase its share of renewables to 13%.<lb/> • Improving energy efficiency by 20%, on the EU level.<lb/> The EU climate change and energy package also contains a commitment to further reduce emissions (in total<lb/> by 30%) if an international agreement with other major emitters is reached.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are a number of direct consequences of the package for Belgium (as well as for other EU countries).<lb/> Firstly, the effective separation between the ETS and non-ETS targets combined with a lack of market mechanisms<lb/> between the two segments means that it is likely that abatement costs are going to differ between the ETS and the<lb/> non-ETS segments. Hence, pure minimum-cost abatement will not be possible, meaning that there is likely to be too<lb/> much abatement in one segment, while cheaper abatement possibilities in the other will not be exploited. Second, the<lb/> individual targets are characterised by strong interactions. For instance, increasing the (Belgian) share of renewable<lb/> energy in terms of electricity production, while likely to reduce the CO2-intensity of the Belgian economy, may not lead<lb/> to any reduction in EU-wide CO2 emissions, as long as the ETS cap remains fixed. In a similar manner, improvements<lb/> in, for example, household energy efficiency that reduce (Belgian) electricity use, will only decrease the price of<lb/> emission permits on the ETS, but not reduce EU-wide emissions (OECD, 2011b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Federal climate change policies and the planned phase-out of nuclear energy<lb/></head>

			<p>Over half of Belgian electricity production takes place in nuclear power plants which constitute the majority of<lb/> base load capacity. On current plans (a 2003 law) nuclear energy is to be phased out between 2015 and 2025. In 2009<lb/> the government took a decision to postpone the phase-out of the three oldest nuclear reactors by 10 years, but the bill<lb/> has not yet been voted. The full depreciation of the nuclear reactors creates a windfall profit for nuclear producers,<lb/> which the government is attempting to tax away. The level of the tax is under discussion,<lb/> Federal strategies regarding climate change and energy policies focus on increasing the role of renewable<lb/> energy sources – from below 4% of total energy consumption currently to 13% by 2020. As smaller scale renewable<lb/> energy sources are a regional competence, the main plans are for off-shore wind energy (2000 MW of windmill parks<lb/> in the North Sea), biomass (adapting two major coal plants) and bio fuels (encouraging the share in fuel transport via a<lb/> quota system). These measures are to reduce emissions by 4%. For the moment, implementation of the plans is<lb/> lagging – for example windmill developments are delayed because of regulatory issues (capacity constraints on the<lb/> connection to the grid and bureaucratic procedures). The government also plans to increase interconnection capacity<lb/> with neighbouring countries (in 2008 net imports of electricity were over 10% of total electricity use). Other measures<lb/> will yield minor effects.<lb/> The replacement of nuclear energy is likely to result in increasing overall CO2 emissions by 12-20%, depending<lb/> on the assumptions. The phase-out may not be directly relevant for the 20/20/20 targets, since there is no &quot; Belgian &quot;<lb/> target for the ETS segment -replacing nuclear with fossil fuel plants will increase the ETS price of emission permits,<lb/> inducing more abatement somewhere across the EU. The resulting increase in electricity prices may have some<lb/> secondary effects on the composition of energy demand, as the relative price of high-emission fossil fuels will<lb/> decrease. Still, there are currently no clear plans on how to replace nuclear. According to a sustainable development<lb/> scenario (GEMIX simulations), a full phase out of nuclear energy would imply an energy mix with about 40% of energy<lb/> coming from windmill farms by 2050. Such an outcome is likely to be expensive due to the limited physical space for<lb/> off-shore windmill plants, and problematic in practice due to their poor reliability to provide base or peak load.<lb/></p>

			<head>The high energy intensity of the economy leads to a large amount of emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite a slight decrease over the past decade, Belgium&apos;s energy intensity of GDP remains above the<lb/> OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The reliance on no-emission nuclear energy reduces overall GHG emission-<lb/>intensity, but is offset by the widespread use of oil products and one of the lowest shares of renewable<lb/> energy in the OECD. Overall, emission intensity is above the EU average. Energy-intensive industry<lb/> generates almost a third of overall GHG emissions, a higher share than in the majority of OECD countries<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Road transport contributes a fifth of emissions (roughly the EU average) while residential<lb/> emissions have the second highest share in the OECD.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cheap energy has encouraged an energy-heavy production mix<lb/></head>

			<p>The energy intensity of Belgian industry is some 50% higher than in the EU15 (IEA, 2010),<lb/> explaining the high GHG emission intensity (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, Panel B). The industry structure cannot entirely<lb/> explain the high energy intensity, as the value added share of energy intensive industries (9%) is basically<lb/> equal to the EU average (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey, 2009</ref>). The low employment rate (OECD, 2011a) suggests the<lb/> production mix may be a result of years of a combination of relatively high labour costs together with<lb/> relatively low energy prices, potentially leading to a substitution away from labour to energy (arguments in<lb/> favour of such substitution can be found in <ref type="biblio">Bassilière et al., 2005</ref>). The relative prices reflect the high level<lb/> of taxes on labour and low energy taxation (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), with excise rates for most fuels being at or close to<lb/> EU minima, some even at zero rates. 5 Belgium also makes use of most of the exemptions to excise taxation<lb/> available under EU law (<ref type="biblio">HCF, 2009 and IEW, 2007</ref>) – for example, large users with an accord or permis<lb/> environnemental face excise tax reductions on fuels up to 100% (HCF, 2009).<lb/></p>

			<head>The development of renewable energy sources is expensive<lb/></head>

			<p>A particular challenge that faces the Belgian economy, in terms of climate change targets, is the<lb/> development of renewable energy. At the current state of technology, Belgium has limited natural<lb/> advantages in terms of renewable energy: the marine territory is limited reducing the potential for off-shore<lb/> windmills, while the largely flat landscape and moderate climate limit the potential for hydropower and<lb/> solar energy. Furthermore, legal and regulatory problems, such as the fact that grid operators in Flanders<lb/> regularly refuse to connect renewable energy producers and disputes on who should bear the connection<lb/> costs, appear to raise entry costs to higher levels than in other countries (AEON, 2010). The result is one of<lb/> the lowest shares of renewables in electricity production in the OECD, coming mainly from biomass,<lb/> mostly imported from overseas. Pre-crisis simulations showed that the share of energy from renewable<lb/> sources was to reach about 7.5% by 2020 -just above half of the Belgian target (<ref type="biblio">Bossier et al., 2008</ref>). The<lb/> effect of the crisis (lower overall energy consumption) and measures taken since 2008 should have a<lb/> positive effect on the share of renewables, nevertheless, without further measures, it seems highly unlikely<lb/> Belgium will meet its renewable targets.<lb/> To encourage the production of electricity from renewable sources, the federal and regional<lb/> governments have introduced green certificates (GC&apos;s, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In line with the division of environmental<lb/> (and energy) responsibilities, the federal level is responsible for certificates concerning energy producers<lb/> connected to the high voltage grid, while the regional certificates concern the low voltage grid. 6 Green<lb/> certificates are issued to renewable energy producers by the relevant energy regulators. Each electricity<lb/> grid operator is obliged to purchase all electricity from renewable producers at a market wholesale price.<lb/> As the costs of renewable energy are generally higher than the wholesale market price, the green producers<lb/> are compensated with gains from selling the GC&apos;s (either on the secondary GC market or to the grid<lb/> operator directly for a minimum price). The grid operator also places the acquired certificates on the<lb/> secondary market and can recuperate the difference between the cost of purchase of the GC&apos;s on the<lb/> primary market and the secondary market price through distribution tariffs. On the secondary market, the<lb/> GC&apos;s are purchased by the final electricity suppliers, each of which is obliged to acquire a certain<lb/> minimum share of its electricity from renewable sources (in 2010 these were 2.8% in BCR, 6% in Flanders<lb/> and 10% in Wallonia). This is done symbolically by acquiring a sufficient amount of GC&apos;s.<lb/></p>

			<p>The renewable policies are poorly co-ordinated across governments, resulting in five<lb/> separate GC markets and making renewable policy unnecessarily expensive. The national programme<lb/> (National Action Plan) for renewable energy is effectively a compilation of federal and regional<lb/> programmes with little mention of intranational spillovers and coordination of the strategies on how to<lb/> achieve the 2020 target. In practice, regions set their own objectives and use different tools to achieve<lb/> them, choosing individually the winning technologies and disregarding the marginal abatement costs. In<lb/> the absence of a price equalisation mechanism, market separation fails to exploit economies of scale and<lb/> scope – regional GC&apos;s do not guarantee that investments in renewables are done where it is economically<lb/> most viable (across the country), raising the costs of achieving the overall objective. The existence of five<lb/> (relatively small) separate GC markets also raises administrative costs, and remains an international<lb/> peculiarity; for instance Norway and Sweden are taking steps to create a common market. 7<lb/> 6.<lb/> The federal government certificates cover the grid above 70 kV.<lb/> 7.<lb/> The fifth separate market exists for combined heat and power production in Flanders. The separation is<lb/> complete aside the agreement to accept Walloon GC&apos;s in Brussels on certain conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The fact that federal certificates are not accepted on the regional markets effectively excludes large<lb/> scale production of renewable energy from the regional quotas and thus favours smaller, and likely less-<lb/>efficient, producers at the regional level. Indeed, when compared with the 55 EUR per MWh estimated<lb/> increase in energy prices necessary to achieve the 2020 renewable targets (by making renewable energy<lb/> economically viable), the regional GC&apos;s appear significantly overpriced, while the majority of the<lb/> federal GC&apos;s are too cheap ( <ref type="biblio">Bossier et al., 2008</ref>). 8 The former provide massive returns on low-risk<lb/> investments in technologies with poor efficiency, 9 and have practically no effect on EU-wide<lb/> CO 2 emissions (Box 1). The excessive prices may have negative environmental consequences, as by<lb/> raising the final consumers&apos; electricity bill they increase the incentives to switch to more polluting fossil<lb/> fuels. Therefore, a common GC could be an efficient solution (<ref type="biblio">De Serres et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> Mandatory minimum prices for certain renewable energy technologies mean that governments are<lb/> heavily involved in picking winning technologies (particularly photovoltaic) and risk limiting the<lb/> incentives to improve their efficiency. To avoid a bias to expensive sources, the single GC market should<lb/> not be bound by minimum prices. Instead, the price of renewable energy, and consequently the<lb/> development of the cheapest and most appropriate technologies, should be left to the market under the<lb/> constraint of a credible national path for the mandatory minimum share of renewable energy. The<lb/> reductions in GC&apos;s requirements for suppliers of large clients (currently in place in all regions) are<lb/> effectively a subsidy to these clients, that is, to large energy consumers, and should be abolished.<lb/></p>

			<table>8.<lb/> Recalculated to 2010 prices, the scenario also requires a carbon price.<lb/> 9.<lb/> CREG (2010b) takes into account all implicit and explicit (federal and regional) government aid in<lb/> Flanders – tax deductions, investment subsidies, and GC&apos;s to calculate the annual returns on equity of 55%<lb/> for PV, over 100% for onshore wind and biomass and in excess of 1 000% for biomass co-combustion in<lb/> existing coal plants. A similar study for Wallonia was not possible due to the lack of data.<lb/></table>

			<p>Renewable energy is also encouraged through a number of investment subsidies and tax reductions.<lb/> At the federal level, households can deduct up to 40% of their investment in renewable energy from<lb/> income tax. Enterprises can deduct 13.5% of their investment in renewable energy from the taxable profits.<lb/> The federal government also provides implicit subsidies to off-shore wind – through minimum prices on<lb/> the GC market, connector cables, covering part of balancing costs and government-backed loans from the<lb/> European Investment Bank (CREG, 2010a). The Flemish government provides investment subsidies to<lb/> enterprises – 10-20% (to double in the future) of the additional costs of investments in renewables 10<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Guisson and Marchal, 2008</ref>). Wallonia provides specific grants for small biomass and combined heat and<lb/> power plants (IEA, 2010). A common, well-designed GC scheme and low market entry barriers would<lb/> ensure the viability of investments in the most efficient renewable technologies across the country and<lb/> improve incentives for R&amp;D in this area.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transport is imposing an increasing burden on the environment<lb/></head>

			<p>The transport sector, as in most EU countries, has undergone the largest growth in emissions since<lb/> 1990 (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>), reflecting increases in traffic volumes (among the highest in the EU15) only partly offset<lb/> by better emission performance of vehicles. Particularly high growth of freight transport volumes mirrors<lb/> increases in world trade as half of the freight traffic is international (<ref type="biblio">Hertveldt et al., 2009</ref>). Passenger<lb/> transport reflects intensive commuting, mostly by car with the use per capita among the highest in<lb/> the OECD. Inland freight transport is mainly on roads, with an internationally high share of inland<lb/> waterways. The road, motorway and rail networks are well developed and among the most dense in<lb/> the OECD, but congestion is a frequent feature in bottleneck areas, in particular in the area of Brussels<lb/> (among the most congested cities in Europe; <ref type="biblio">Le Soir, 2010</ref>) and Antwerp. On current policies, emissions<lb/> from transport are expected to continue growing over the next decade (<ref type="biblio">Bossier et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>A particular feature is the internationally high share of diesel use (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>), reflecting the diesel-<lb/>dominance of Belgian passenger cars (57%, second only to Luxembourg in the OECD, driving some<lb/> 70% of the vehicle-kilometres) and an important role of international transport. This results, to a large<lb/> extent, from the relatively low taxation of diesel fuels (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>), which is some 40% lower (excise<lb/> taxation, per litre) than gasoline, despite its 15% higher carbon content and higher related emissions of<lb/> other pollutants such as NO x and particulate matter. The two latter are a major problem, in particular in<lb/> Brussels (Box 3). Furthermore, low diesel prices lead to a &quot; diesel illusion &quot; – one in four Belgians that opt<lb/> for diesel do not drive enough to make this choice financially viable and would be better off buying a<lb/> gasoline car (VAB, 2008).<lb/></p>

Air pollution is linked to transport and household heating<lb/></table>

			<p>The two main problems with air quality in Belgium are nitrogen di-oxide (NO2) emissions and particulate matter (particularly<lb/> PM10), both largely due to the widespread use of diesel fuels in transport and heating. In the case of particulate matter, the agricultural<lb/> sector is also an important emission source. As most EU countries, Belgium is likely to have met the 2010 EU targets for all pollutants<lb/> apart from nitrogen oxides (NOx) but the margin by which the NOx target has been missed is among the highest (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). For<lb/> particulate matter, excess concentration is among the most widespread among the EU15 with almost all the monitored zones<lb/> exceeding the daily (though not the annual) limits. The problems are particularly acute in Brussels and Antwerp. Overall, the problems<lb/> with complying with the EU&apos;s daily limit values for PM10 are likely to persist for many years to come (<ref type="biblio">Fierens et al., 2006, Deutsch et<lb/> al., 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In transport, the abatement of PMx and NOx -not directly linked to the quantity of fuel consumed -is largely pursued via<lb/> EU emission norms for vehicles. Still, even the most recent EURO 5 emission norms for passenger cars permit three times higher<lb/> NOx emissions for diesel than for gasoline cars, with particularly high freight emissions. Particulate matter norms are equalised for the<lb/> two fuels in EURO 5, though in practice the emission of PMx from gasoline cars is negligible. Moreover, there remains a large stock of<lb/> old vehicles, which do not comply with the stricter recent norms -it will take another 10 years till EURO 5 vehicles drive more than<lb/> older cars (<ref type="biblio">TML, 2006</ref>). Finally, since their introduction the EURO norms have not been effective in reducing NOx emissions per litre<lb/> of fuels, in part as they concern emissions under very specific test-conditions, while in practice values can often be significantly higher<lb/> and concern new cars while emission performance may deteriorate significantly over vehicle life (DEFRA, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<p>Additional incentives for car use and ownership arise from the tax treatment of company cars and<lb/> purchase subsidies for &quot; environmentally friendly &quot; vehicles. 11 Company cars provided by employers are<lb/> strongly encouraged. Private use is treated as a lump sum in-kind benefit, with the taxable value between<lb/> EUR 630 and EUR 2 400 per year depending on emission class. As a result, employers have been treating<lb/> company cars as cheap non-wage compensation cost and the number of company cars is estimated at 22%<lb/> of the passenger car fleet, of which a third are considered as in-kind benefits (<ref type="biblio">Mossakowski, 2011</ref>). The<lb/> cars are often provided with a so-called fuel card, a benefit which effectively facilitates the treatment of<lb/> fuel expenditures as company costs. Over the past years, the federal government made steps to green the<lb/> company car fleet by linking fiscal deductibility of the cars to their CO 2 emissions and, in 2010, reducing<lb/> the deductibility of fuel cards to 75%. These measures should have positive environmental effects, but do<lb/> not go far enough to repair the damage done by underpriced car use. The tax treatment of such in-kind<lb/> benefits should be the same as of standard income.<lb/></p>

			<p>The federal government also encourages the purchase of low-emission vehicles through a tax rebate<lb/> of 15% or 3% of the price for cars with CO 2 emissions below 105 g/km and 115 g/km respectively. 12<lb/> Intended to green the car fleet, the bonus also encourages the purchase of small diesel cars aggravating the<lb/> problem of NO x and particulate emissions in city centres, while its abatement cost is rather high -EUR 446<lb/> and EUR 817 per tonne of CO 2 for the two categories respectively (HCF, 2009). In the Walloon region, the<lb/> effects are amplified by an environmental bonus/malus system for car purchase. At the same time, car<lb/> purchase and annual ownership taxes seem to be among the least discriminatory with respect to CO 2 across<lb/> EU countries (see Braathen, 2011 for a comparison of Walloon numbers with other EU countries). All such<lb/> subsidies have a high deadweight cost, as they are also given to people who would opt for a low-emission<lb/> car anyway, a high fiscal cost (over EUR 200 million in 2010) and should be scrapped. The objective of<lb/> greening transport should be pursued through marginal externality taxation of fuels, in particular a carbon<lb/> tax (see below)</p>

			<head>. 13<lb/></head>

			<p>The federal government supports commuting through relatively complicated and generous commuting<lb/> allowances which lower the marginal costs of travelling to work by all modes of transport (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).<lb/> Particular benefits concern public transport and collective transport and no distance limits are imposed on<lb/> car travel. The system provides disincentives for moving closer to the workplace. Hence, the commuting<lb/> allowance, particularly for road transport, should be either targeted to low-income workers, who otherwise<lb/> risk falling out of the labour market, or replaced by a lump sum subsidy for such groups.<lb/></p>

			<figure>11.<lb/> Ownership taxes (registration and annual road tax) are moderate relative to other EU countries.<lb/> Registration and annual road tax are based related to the engine size and power (so-called fiscal power).<lb/> Even for very polluting cars the registration tax falls with age.<lb/> 12.<lb/> The federal rebate is limited to EUR 4 500 per car. The total cost of the measure in 2010 was<lb/> EUR 208 million (double that of 2009) – on average almost EUR 2 000 per car. Given the limited<lb/> availability of cars with low emissions, a large share of the rebate may be pocketed by the producers<lb/> (HCF, 2009).<lb/></figure>

			<p>13.<lb/> To the extent there may be an overall case for encouraging the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, as<lb/> consumers may tend to undervalue the (far-in – the-future) fuel savings relative to purchase costs (OECD,<lb/> 2009b) – this can be done through purchase taxation (or registration fees) rather than subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Public transport and bicycles are encouraged through tax benefits and other direct and indirect<lb/> subsidies (reduced VAT, fuel tax exemption for public transport). The government refunds 20% of the<lb/> commuting cost if the employer pays the rest. Despite this, only about 9% of Flemish and Walloon<lb/> residents use public transport for commuting (the share is about 50% for Brussels residents), reflecting that<lb/> public transport lacks flexibility to substitute the car on a wider basis (SPF <ref type="biblio">Mobility, 2010</ref>). One factor<lb/> may be that public bus transport is organised by a separate body in each of the regions and trains are the<lb/> competence of a federal body, making co-ordination complicated. Moreover, at the regional level, land<lb/> regulation issues and financing issues play a role, as for instance visible in the lagging setup of the regional<lb/> express rail for Brussels.<lb/></p>

			<p>The limited ability of public transport to adapt to changes in demand, points to the need for flexibility<lb/> and more competitive pressure. More co-ordination among the regional and local governments is a must<lb/> and bus schedules and routes should be made more flexible to accommodate demand. Tendering of<lb/> services, currently used to a limited extent in Flanders, should be encouraged. Operators should be able to<lb/> propose new routes, and entry barriers need to be lowered, by guaranteeing access to infrastructure. Ticket<lb/> prices should remain regulated, due to the limited scope for competition, but subsidies should be<lb/> transparent and follow a clearly identified benefit (e.g. mobility, equity, urban reasons). The government<lb/> wishing to impose obligations (e.g. free tickets for elderly) should pay the full cost directly. Finally, in<lb/> order to green public transport by improving load factors, more flexibility should be coupled with exposing<lb/> operators to price signals to encourage emission reductions – they should pay the full (external) costs of<lb/> their activity (e.g. fuel taxes).<lb/></p>

			<head>External costs can be internalised through fuel taxation and a congestion charge<lb/></head>

			<p>Fuel taxation is generally well below the external costs generated by road transport, encouraging the<lb/> demand for transport and relatively high fuel consumption (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey, 2009</ref>). As in most countries, fuel<lb/> taxation is generally higher than most estimates of marginal environmental externalities generated by<lb/> transport. However, the costs incurred by transport through fuel taxation are disproportionately large for<lb/> gasoline powered passenger cars, compared to diesel powered cars and in particular freight vehicles. This<lb/> is largely due to lower relative taxation of diesel, which is associated with external costs of a magnitude<lb/> higher than gasoline, mainly due to NO x and PM x emissions. Moreover, if the non-environmental<lb/> externalities, such as road wear and tear, accident costs and in particular congestion, are taken into account,<lb/> fuel taxation appears too low, in particular for freight. Both of these arguments are strengthened in<lb/> Belgium by the low taxation of diesel (see CE <ref type="biblio">Delft, 2008, Koźluk, 2010</ref>, for international examples and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Hertveldt et al., 2009</ref>, for a Belgian specific study). The arguments against higher fuel taxation are mainly<lb/> related to competitiveness (of the freight sector and the port of Antwerp) and fiscal revenue leakage. Low<lb/> taxation of diesel diminishes the incentives provided by the government subsidies for shifting freight from<lb/> road to rail and inland waterways (IWW). At the same time, empirical analysis generally fails to find<lb/> evidence of a significant effect of changes in fuel prices relative to neighbouring countries on fiscal<lb/> revenues (<ref type="biblio">Schmitz, 2011</ref>), though the importance of international traffic means that a substantial unilateral<lb/> increase is sure to have some consequences. Nevertheless, the overall effects of higher fuel prices on fuel<lb/> consumption are likely to be limited in the short to medium term – estimates show that a 1% increase in<lb/> fuel prices would lead to about a 0.2-0.3% decrease in fuel demand (<ref type="biblio">Schmitz, 2011</ref>). Long-term effects are<lb/> likely to be higher as car owners switch to more fuel efficient vehicles (<ref type="biblio">Goodwin et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fuel taxation should be adjusted in line with the marginal externalities – the users who emit pollutants<lb/> should pay the marginal costs of their activity, so that they face the adequate incentives to reduce pollution.<lb/> This means primarily increasing the relative taxation of the more polluting diesel, which should reduce the<lb/> Belgian diesel bias, thereby lowering NO x and particulate emissions. Such a reform was recommended in<lb/> the 2009 Survey, and the federal government made a step in this direction by increasing the excise on<lb/> diesel in 2010. To boost the effectiveness of price-related measures, Belgium-specific price regulations<lb/> should be scrapped: the price cap on automotive fuels, the automatic adjustment of excise taxes to<lb/> accommodate large fuel price changes (inverse cliquet) and special refund of part of the excise tax for<lb/> vans, buses, taxis and trucks (professional diesel).<lb/></figure>

			<p>A particular externality of road transport is congestion. The estimates of the cost of congestion in<lb/> Belgium range from 0.05% of GDP (<ref type="biblio">Hoornaert et al., 2009</ref>) to 2% of GDP (<ref type="biblio">INFRAS, 2004</ref>), largely<lb/> concentrated in bottlenecks around Brussels and Antwerp. An efficient instrument to tackle this issue, in<lb/> particular given the concentrated nature of congestion in Belgium, is a congestion charge for each<lb/> kilometre driven in bottleneck areas and times (<ref type="biblio">Fosgerau and Van Dender, 2010; Eliasson, 2010</ref>) or a<lb/> simpler version such as city access charges (urban tolls) introduced in several cities in the OECD<lb/> (e.g. London, Oslo, Stockholm). Such charges are well targeted to deal with local problems at a limited<lb/> overall cost. A congestion charge is likely to be a viable solution to the traffic problems of Brussels,<lb/> reducing queues, travel time and improving air quality, but its introduction encounters a major obstacle due<lb/> to the regional division of powers in transport policies, as the outer ring road passes through Wallonia and<lb/> Flanders.<lb/></p>

			<head>Road pricing can be a viable solution<lb/></head>

			<p>A more comprehensive, if ambitious, solution would be a nation-wide GPS-based road charge, such<lb/> as the system recently proposed in the Netherlands (<ref type="biblio">Koźluk, 2010</ref>)</p>

			<table>. 14 Such a scheme should include a<lb/> 14.<lb/> In late 2009 the Dutch government (unsuccessfully) attempted to introduce a road pricing scheme to cover<lb/> all roads and (almost) all vehicles, moving away from fixed vehicle taxation (registration and annual<lb/> ownership taxes) to a user-pays system of charging road transport. A fixed vehicle-related per-kilometre<lb/> per-kilometre charge linked to the externalities generated by different categories of vehicles and a<lb/> congestion surcharge in bottleneck areas. The system could bring about substantial reductions in<lb/> GHG emissions from transport and air pollutants while limiting the negative impact on economic activity<lb/> (for instance, contrary to fuel taxation road pricing does not discriminate between domestic transport<lb/> services and transit transport, and does not encourage fuelling up abroad). If the externalities linked to fuel<lb/> consumption (such as CO 2</table>

			<p>) would be embodied in fuel taxes, the per-kilometre prices could take care of<lb/> the other externalities, in particular those linked to the driven distance (e.g. road wear and tear),<lb/> discriminating by category of vehicle. The price-discrimination across categories would also improve the<lb/> NO x and particulate emission performance (Box 3). It could first be rolled out for freight (as in Germany<lb/> and Slovakia) and utility vehicles, as this is likely to be more politically feasible. For the same reason, road<lb/> pricing in Belgium might first apply to company cars, and as the scheme gains more public acceptance, it<lb/> can subsequently be extended to all traffic.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2011, the three regions agreed on introducing a common GPS-based per-kilometre road charge for<lb/> freight, though at the moment of writing details were not available. Such a system can only be efficient if<lb/> introduced uniformly across the country, and even more so, if introduced across neighbouring countries.<lb/> Moreover, when introduced for passenger transport, road pricing or congestion charges are likely to<lb/> increase the demand for public transport, in particular in peak hours, raising the importance of making<lb/> services more responsive to demand.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household energy efficiency is poor due to weak incentives<lb/></head>

			<p>The housing stock is poorly insulated (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>), contributing to household energy use (per square<lb/> metre) 70% above the EU average (twice that in the neighbouring Netherlands) and residential emissions<lb/> per capita twice the OECD average (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref> and McKinsey, 2009). A third of the housing stock pre-dates<lb/> 1945 (particularly in Brussels and Wallonia) and heating systems tend to be old (HCF, 2009). Non-<lb/>compliance with building norms means that the problems are not limited to old buildings (OECD, 2007a).<lb/> Given the relatively high prices of electricity (<ref type="biblio">Koźluk, 2009</ref>), the main source of household heating is<lb/> natural gas. Heating oil, roughly a third more emission-intensive than gas (CO 2 per GJ), plays an important<lb/> role (half of the energy use in Wallonia, a third in Flanders and Brussels).<lb/></p>

			<head>Household energy policies – too much of a good thing<lb/></head>

			<p>Energy prices are not providing adequate incentives to increase energy efficiency of housing, in part<lb/> due to the widespread use of social energy policies (Box 4) and, to a smaller extent, employer-provided<lb/> in-kind benefits. As lower energy tariffs discourage energy saving, they should be scrapped, while social<lb/> objectives should be pursued through social policies, such as a lump-sum income subsidy targeted at low-<lb/>income households, coupled with measures to increase the accessibility of energy-efficiency investments<lb/> for such groups (see below). Another group not directly exposed to energy prices are those subject to the<lb/> in-kind benefit, whereby the employer pays the electricity and heating bills. Such benefits are taxed as a<lb/> lump-sum, regardless of the actual amount, 15 making them a cheap non-wage benefit. These benefits have<lb/> negative environmental effects as concerned households face zero marginal costs of energy and are more<lb/> likely to benefit higher income groups. Such benefits should be taxed as any other wage income.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Social energy policies and the incentives for saving energy<lb/></head>

			<p>Heating affordability for low-income households is guaranteed through the Social Heating Fund – a lump sum subsidy of<lb/> up to EUR 300 per year (heating oil and natural gas bill). In addition, there is the so-called social energy (electricity and gas)<lb/> tariff, equal to the lowest commercial (i.e. industry) tariff in the area and available to almost 7% (electricity) and over 5% (gas)<lb/> of households. Since 2009, the attribution of social tariffs became automatic. Households eligible for social tariffs are also<lb/> exempt from the federal surcharge on energy and face a price that can be well below half of the market tariff, hence providing<lb/> much lower marginal incentives to save energy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reduced VAT rate (12%) on coal for households can also be regarded as a social policy, given that low-income<lb/> households are the most likely to be heated with coal. Despite a large decrease, coal still heats some 2% of households in<lb/> Flanders, and the lower VAT effectively decreases the incentives to change to alternative fuels.<lb/> In Flanders, all households are eligible for a free electricity quota for each household member. This may further<lb/> decrease the saving incentive for households eligible for social tariffs (by reducing the total energy bill), but the effect on other<lb/> households is unclear. The free quota has to be incorporated into retailers&apos; pricing strategies and hence forces a higher tariff<lb/> on the remaining consumption – potentially increasing the incentive to save.<lb/></p>

			<head>15</head>

			<p>.<lb/> The employer pays the annual bills, and the employees are taxes as if they received a lump sum income of<lb/> EUR 370 in case of electricity, EUR 740 for heating. In case of management personnel the amount subject<lb/> to taxation is twice as high. This amount has been increasing fairly rapidly in the recent years.<lb/></p>

			<p>To counter the weak energy saving incentives and promote energy efficiency, the governments have<lb/> stepped up measures to directly encourage investment in improvement of housing. The federal government<lb/> offers numerous tax reductions (e.g. for the replacement or improvement of boilers, windows, insulation of<lb/> roofs, walls and ceilings, energy-saving devices, installation of heat pumps, solar heaters and solar panels)<lb/> of up to EUR 2 650 per household per year (40% of expenses). The regions top these up by a multitude of<lb/> subsidies: 22 in Wallonia (down from 48 in 2009), 20 in Brussels and 18 in Flanders, some of which are<lb/> decided upon an annual basis.<lb/> The focus on energy efficiency improvements is commendable, in particular given the<lb/> 20/20/20 objectives, but the actual outcomes are rather disappointing (HCF, 2009). One reason is that<lb/> government measures tend to pick &quot; winning &quot; technologies, disregarding the relative cost efficiency and<lb/> despite the explicit advice from government-financed energy audits of households. The lowest subsidies<lb/> are provided for measures most efficient in energy saving: roof, wall and ground insulation, window<lb/> replacement (Renard,2008 and De <ref type="biblio">Coninck and Verbeeck, 2006</ref>). A simple calculation based on 2008 data<lb/> shows that due to federal and regional fiscal incentives, a Walloon homeowner would choose to install<lb/> photovoltaic panels (PV) over wall insulation, where the latter would be six times more cost-efficient in<lb/> reducing CO 2 (<ref type="biblio">Spies and Buxant, 2008</ref>). The cost of CO 2 avoidance for the taxpayer would be EUR 23 per<lb/> tonne in the case of wall insulation, but EUR 1 600 for PV, with similar outcomes in the other regions.<lb/> Notably, the situation in Wallonia itself has improved somewhat, due to the reforms of Walloon measures,<lb/> including scrapping of some of the regional subsidies to PV The strong public support for PV resulted in<lb/> increasing take up in 2010, but is questionable given the climate conditions and no cost/benefit assessment<lb/> of the policies (IEA, 2010). Similarly, fiscal incentives support both the replacement of old boilers as well<lb/> as their maintenance. Most old boilers are subject to quasi-mandatory replacement (because of government<lb/> or insurance norms), implying an effective subsidy to comply. 16 Finally, many existing subsidies concern<lb/> also new housing, where measures could be implemented more effectively through stricter building<lb/> standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>The incentives for insulation are more complicated for rented housing, which constitutes roughly a<lb/> quarter of Belgian housing. Tenants are likely to be less willing to invest in energy improvements of their<lb/> housing, not being able to reclaim the full benefits from the investment. Similarly, owners of rented<lb/> property have limited possibility to recuperate the cost of the investment because of rent regulation. In<lb/> principle, rent regulation foresees a phased-in increase of the rent due to an increase in property value (for<lb/> instance due to an investment in energy efficiency). Still, the quality and energy efficiency of rented<lb/> property remains rather poor, and a reviewing rent regulation in this respect, to introduce stronger<lb/> incentives, should be considered. 17<lb/></p>

			<head>Price signals provide the most straightforward incentives, while awareness could be improved,<lb/></head>

			<p>The importance of nuclear energy in providing base load electricity capacity means that base load is<lb/> relatively CO 2 -free compared with gas-and coal-powered peak load. This distinction may not be<lb/> straightforward in a unified EU energy market, but due to capacity constraints on the Belgian international<lb/> connection grid, it is possible to assume that peak load is largely supplied by local producers. Hence, the<lb/> 16.<lb/> HCF also noted that given the very limited competition in many of the subsidised areas (e.g. energy audits,<lb/> installation of equipment) suppliers are likely to take over a large part of the subsidy – reducing the effect<lb/> on households&apos; behaviour. Moreover, the division of powers obstructs the flow of these services -licenses<lb/> for installation of facilities (e.g. PV) and audits issued in one region are not recognised in the other.<lb/> 17.<lb/> For example in Wallonia, 70% of owner occupied housing and only 50% of rented housing is classified as<lb/> good or very good standard (<ref type="biblio">Carlier et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/> governments also aim at smoothing electricity consumption, particularly through the 24-hour day. This can<lb/> be done by encouraging meters with day/night tariff readings or the more costly so-called smart meters<lb/> with real time readings. The Flemish government is planning smart metering by 2018, while tests are<lb/> underway in Wallonia. As emphasised, such measures will not affect CO 2 emissions in the EU, as long as<lb/> the ETS cap remains unchanged (Box 1).<lb/> Households&apos; energy efficiency awareness is poor. The data for Brussels reveals that many households<lb/> are unaware of the state of insulation of their houses and thus is unlikely to take up subsidies (of which<lb/> many households have not heard) or in general to improve the energy efficiency of housing (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). 18<lb/> The rental and secondary markets are also likely to suffer from the asymmetry of information, if the<lb/> owners do not reveal the energy efficiency of houses put on the market. The governments have recently<lb/> taken steps to reduce asymmetry by increasing energy awareness by making energy certificates (PEB) an<lb/> obligatory document for the placement of houses on the market. Other measures include labelling of<lb/> products (e.g. domestic appliances) but arguably, households&apos; incentives would increase with the energy<lb/> price.<lb/> Overall, the existing subsidies for energy saving should be scrapped and the incentives should be<lb/> provided through energy prices. Government policies should focus on fixing market failures in the areas<lb/> where efficiency can be improved in economically viable ways:<lb/> • Internalising the costs of externalities associated with energy use into the prices (through an<lb/> externality tax, such as a carbon tax on heating fuels).<lb/> • Reducing uncertainty for investments which are likely to break-even in years, by providing<lb/> credible paths for externality taxation.<lb/> • Supporting liquidity constrained low-income households to make such investments, (through<lb/> targeted investment subsidies or cheap loans) to exploit relatively cheap abatement possibilities,<lb/> as low-income households are likely to live in poorly insulated housing. In this line, the federal<lb/> government has recently set aside funds to promote third-party financing and cheap loans for<lb/> energy efficiency improvements of low-income households (FRCE/FRGE), while the regions are<lb/> providing cheap loans.<lb/> • Improving energy-efficiency awareness.<lb/> • Enforcing minimum building standards for new housing.<lb/> Notably, a number of the measures proposed above will also encourage more cost-efficient abatement<lb/> in the remainder of the non-ETS segment: small industry, services and agriculture.<lb/></p>

			<head>Purchasing emission rights abroad may slow adjustment to a less carbon-intensive economy<lb/></head>

			<p>The national burden-sharing agreement foresees that the federal government offsets emissions<lb/> purchasing carbon credits through Kyoto flexible mechanisms (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Almost half of the overall amount<lb/> of carbon credits for 2008-12 has already been delivered by mid-2011 (of which a third through emission<lb/> rights purchases and two-thirds through projects reducing CO 2 emissions in developing countries). The<lb/> carbon prices paid are confidential. As mentioned, regions can also use flexible mechanisms. Such<lb/> investments are a viable Kyoto tool that encourages emission reductions in developing countries, where<lb/> they are likely to be cheaper. However, there is a risk that the strategy may be short-sighted. Such<lb/> 18.<lb/> Part of is be due to Brussels-specific reasons – an urban character of housing (more blocks of flats), more<lb/> rented housing and more social tariff benefiters. Data for Flanders show that just above half of survey<lb/> respondents heard of the federal tax reductions, most of them in the higher income groups (Cour des<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Comptes, 2009</ref>).<lb/> purchases are financed through the federal surcharge on energy which is subject to a reduction for large<lb/> users, effectively shielding large emitters from external costs at the expense of small users. The result is<lb/> reduced incentives for restructuring towards a less polluting technology mix and &quot; green &quot; R&amp;D, which may<lb/> delay the necessary adjustment to a less carbon intensive economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Polluters must face the marginal cost of damages to ensure cost-efficient abatement<lb/></head>

			<p>Environmental taxation is used far less than in other OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). Fossil fuels taxes<lb/> are among the lowest in Europe (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>) resulting in a very low implicit CO 2 prices (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>) and a higher<lb/> than optimal use of fuels, likely skewing the production mix from labour to energy and dampening<lb/> incentives for energy-saving and environmentally friendly R&amp;D. Only taxation in the category<lb/> pollution/resources (for instance land-fill taxes and packaging waste, Box 5) is above that in most<lb/> EU countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Eco-taxes – limited environmental effect so far<lb/></head>

			<p>The eco-tax law (1993) introduced product taxes to discourage consumption of certain (environmentally<lb/> harmful) goods by encouraging a switch to less harmful substitutes; hence in principle the taxes were to yield<lb/> minimal revenues. The law included a first list of products subject to eco-taxation while further decisions were<lb/> left to a committee of experts established for this purpose. The proposed products were drink containers, some<lb/> types of industrial packaging, some disposable products (disposable razors till 1997 and cameras), batteries,<lb/> pesticides (abolished in 2001) and paper. Most products would be exempt if a collection and recycling scheme<lb/> was organised.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main problems with these eco-taxes concern industry opposition to placing individual products on the<lb/> list, the lack of transparency and clarity of the motivation and the exclusion of major users of pesticides<lb/> (agriculture) from taxation. As a result, the goods subject to eco-taxes were mainly marginal yielding doubtful<lb/> environmental gains. Few products added to the list in due course: disposable plastic crockery, plastic bags, and<lb/> containers of ink, glue and solvent for professional use. The revenue from the eco-taxes is indeed negligible<lb/> (EUR 0.2 million in 2010) aside the tax on drink containers (EUR 200 million).<lb/></p>

			<head>A country-wide carbon tax would reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency<lb/></head>

			<p>Increasing the overall taxation of energy should bring about a cost-efficient reduction in emissions.<lb/> Well-designed energy taxation would entail pricing the associated emissions (or generally, pollution),<lb/> thereby giving polluters the appropriate and straightforward incentives to reduce harmful activity in a<lb/> cost-effective way (Box 6). This should be achieved by realigning excise taxes and introducing a carbon<lb/> tax on fuels. Current excise taxes on fuels have no relation to the environmental externalities – the implicit<lb/> carbon prices differ vastly among fuels and among different uses of the same fuel (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). Greater<lb/> neutrality should be introduced if the associated externalities do not differ too widely (there may be a<lb/> special case for transport fuels, see above). To ensure efficient abatement at minimum cost marginal<lb/> externalities should be built into prices. In particular, GHG externalities should be addressed with a carbon<lb/> price. As the ETS segment of the economy is de facto subject to a carbon price, a carbon tax should be<lb/> introduced for the non-ETS segment of the economy (primarily transport and housing, but also small<lb/> industry, services and agriculture), particularly as this is where emissions have been increasing over the<lb/> past two decades. 19 Given the high uncertainty about the optimal carbon price, the level of the carbon tax<lb/> should be chosen with the aim of achieving the Belgian GHG 20/20/20 objective. 20 In this light, the<lb/> government should establish a clear, credible timetable for the carbon tax (with some adjustment<lb/> possibilities) in order to provide sufficient incentives to invest in greener technologies and R&amp;D, as such<lb/> investment is likely to break-even only over a long time frame. The new carbon tax may need to be<lb/> adjusted to respect to EU guidelines, given recent EU Commission&apos;s proposals regarding changes in<lb/> energy taxations (EC, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Cost-efficient &quot; green &quot; policies – polluters should face the marginal cost of externalities<lb/> &quot; Green-growth &quot; policies should aim at overcoming the market failures arising from: the environment being a<lb/> public good; the costs of monitoring and enforcement; imperfect or asymmetric information; and capital market<lb/> imperfections (De <ref type="biblio">Serres et al., 2010, Duval, 2008</ref>). The main principles for choosing instruments to reach climate<lb/> change and environmental goals entail:<lb/> • equalising the marginal abatement cost across emission sources to ensure lowest-cost abatement;<lb/> • fostering an efficient level of innovation, in order to lower future abatement costs;<lb/> • coping effectively with future risks and uncertainties.<lb/> Externality taxation usually meets opposition on competitiveness grounds and, in the case of<lb/> GHG emissions, because of the fear of carbon leakage. However, there is no obvious relation between<lb/> environmental tax revenues and competitiveness (<ref type="biblio">HCF, 2009</ref>) in particular within a co-ordinated<lb/> EU approach. The ETS segment will face a carbon price by default, while the rest of the economy (mainly<lb/> transport and residential) is less directly exposed to international competition. As all EU countries<lb/> introduce measures to fulfil the 20/20/20 objectives, they impose a carbon price, explicit or implicit. The<lb/> wider the coverage of a uniform carbon price, the more likely that emissions are reduced at the lowest cost.<lb/> Carbon taxation will burden particularly heavy emission sources, but indeed this is the point of reorienting<lb/> the economy to a greener path. A balance, though, must be found between a gradual introduction,</p>

			<table>which<lb/> 19.<lb/> During 1990-2009, Belgian non-ETS GHG emissions grew by 2.5%, while ETS emissions fell by 21%.<lb/> 20.<lb/> Establishing an optimal carbon price is subject to the enormous uncertainty surrounding the economic<lb/> effects of GHG emissions and climate change, to materialize decades and centuries ahead. Meta-analyses<lb/> show a vast range of estimates – a mean price of a tonne of CO 2 from a survey of 232 estimates is around<lb/> EUR 60 (2010 prices) and the median around EUR 30, with extreme values not being uncommon (<ref type="biblio">Tol,<lb/> 2009, Kuik et al, 2009</ref>). Simulations performed for Belgium show that achieving 2020 goals would require<lb/> a carbon price of EUR 37 per tonne in the ETS segment and EUR 28 per tonne in the non-ETS segment<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Bassiliere et al., 2008</ref>, adjusted to 2010 prices).<lb/> gives polluters time for less abrupt adjustment, and an excessively long phase-in which would punish<lb/> cleaner technologies and risk the failure of meeting international obligations.<lb/> At the moment, practically all Belgian ETS emission permits are grandfathered (granted for free based<lb/> on historical emissions) providing windfall profits to heavy polluters. This should not prevent an efficient<lb/> allocation of emission rights, as rights are tradable. However, it does imply transfers from energy<lb/> consumers to producers. Moreover, empirical evidence show producers passing on the opportunity costs of<lb/> holding CO 2 permits (obtained for free) to the wholesale price in most EU countries (<ref type="biblio">Sijm et al., 2008</ref>) and<lb/> in particular in <ref type="biblio">Belgium (CREG, 2008</ref>) where estimated windfall gains for electricity producers are in the<lb/> area of ½ per cent of GDP for 2005-07. Increasing the scope of auctioning would reduce windfall gains,<lb/> yield revenue and improve the governments&apos; experience in the auctioning system, but for the next few<lb/> years the effects will remain minute under EU limits on auctioning. In this case, the federal government<lb/> should consider fully taxing away the windfall profit gained from grandfathering of permits. 21<lb/> A carbon tax would also encourage energy efficiency – currently promoted through tax reductions for<lb/> industry, voluntary agreements and requirements on utility suppliers. The federal government grants higher<lb/> corporate income tax deductions for energy-efficiency and green investments, while the regions revert to<lb/> voluntary agreements. Flanders and Wallonia have signed agreements with enterprises covering over 90%<lb/> of emissions, rewarding participants with tax benefits (such as exemptions from the federal excise tax on<lb/> fossil fuels), exemptions from selected regulatory requirements and financial aid. Electricity suppliers have<lb/> a public service obligation of saving energy (IEA, 2010) under which they are to achieve annual reductions<lb/> in final consumers&apos; energy use under the threat of a fine (Flanders and Brussels) or in return for a premium<lb/> (Wallonia). None of the measures seem a first best solution in a national context: tax breaks (CIT and<lb/> excise) come at a high fiscal cost, while voluntary agreements are generally unlikely to be very effective in<lb/> reducing emissions (<ref type="biblio">De Serres et al., 2010</ref>) in particular if lower energy prices are granted in return.<lb/> Moreover, such measures may have undesirable effects on emissions if electricity (and gas) is substituted<lb/> with e.g. heating oil. Appropriate energy saving incentives should come from a national carbon tax.<lb/></p>

			<head>Revenues from environmental taxation could be used to lower taxes on labour<lb/></head>

			<p>The revenues from environmental taxation can be used to reduce more growth-distorting taxation,<lb/> such as on labour, aiding the transition from an energy-intensive economy and potentially preserving the<lb/> competitiveness of Belgian companies (see for example <ref type="biblio">Bassilière et al., 2009</ref>). A well-designed shift in<lb/> the taxation burden from labour to energy would be likely to increase employment (<ref type="biblio">Bassilière et al., 2005<lb/> and 2009</ref>) but admittedly, with automatic wage indexation (OECD, 2011a), this effect may be limited if the<lb/> higher prices (due to environmental taxation, though potentially offset by lower labour costs) are translated<lb/> into wage increases. Simple static calculations show that revenues equal to 10-15% of labour taxation<lb/> could be obtained from a combination of: increasing environmental taxation to the EU average level; a<lb/> carbon tax (non-ETS segment); and taxing away of windfall gains from free permits (ETS) and scrapping<lb/> subsidies and tax reductions for transport, energy prices and energy-efficiency investments. Concerns<lb/> about the regressive nature of environmental taxes (poorer households tend to have a higher share of<lb/> energy in the consumption basket) could be addressed by focusing the reductions in labour taxation on the<lb/> lower end of the income distribution. Still, many of the existing measures (in-kind benefits such as<lb/> company cars, fuel cards, energy bills; energy efficiency subsidies) benefit mostly higher-income<lb/> households; hence their scrapping could increase the progressivity of fiscal policies (HCF, 2009). Finally,<lb/> 21.<lb/> One of the concerns with electricity producers paying the price of CO 2 emissions is that wholesale<lb/> electricity prices are set reflecting the marginal price of the most expensive production site operating. The<lb/> carbon price increases this marginal price and thus creates a windfall gain for nuclear producers. In<lb/> principle, (part of) this profit can be taxed away, but in practice not for imported energy.<lb/> higher revenues could also allow for more spending to improve the poor state of nature preservation<lb/> (Box 7).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7. Environmental protection is costly, but should play a more important role<lb/></head>

			<p>The strong pressure on the environment comes from dense population, intensive industry, agriculture and<lb/> transport. Land use reflects the high population density – residential and commercial services take up 19% of land use,<lb/> second in the EU and two-and-a-half times the EU average. Industry and transport use 6% of land area, twice the<lb/> EU average. Agriculture takes up 53%, leaving little space for nature. Despite progress in the recent years, Belgium is<lb/> the OECD country with the lowest surface of protected environmental areas per capita, and among the lowest in terms<lb/> of protected areas relative to total surface (the first and so far only national park of 57 square km was opened in<lb/> Flanders in 2006). The level of protection of these areas is generally lower than elsewhere. Together with years of<lb/> extremely poor surface water quality this has contributed to a situation where the share of threatened species among<lb/> indigenous fauna and flora are well above that in most OECD countries. The heavy implicit and explicit subsidies to<lb/> agriculture and land use policies have placed Belgium among the handful of OECD countries where the share of forest<lb/> land has not grown since 1990, reflecting in part poor take-up of EU agricultural land forestation programmes<lb/> (OECD, 2007a).<lb/></p>

			<figure>in the area of water quality are visible, but suffer from a large backlog<lb/></figure>

			<p>Significant attention was devoted to water quality in a previous environmental chapter (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2001</ref>),<lb/> in part as the exploitation of water resources is among the most intensive in the EU. At the time, both<lb/> surface and underground water quality were among the poorest in the EU, due to the effective lack of<lb/> treatment of urban wastewater and very intensive agriculture. Brussels, with roughly 1 million inhabitants,<lb/> dumped its urban sewage directly to the Senne river. Since then, government efforts have reduced the<lb/> backlog in urban wastewater treatment. In 2001 the first treatment plant for Brussels, treating a third of its<lb/> sewage, was put in place. The unsatisfactory situation of the mid-2000s (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>) has improved<lb/> significantly and by 2010 the number of agglomerations with insufficient treatment was reduced to 1 in<lb/> Flanders and halved to 30 in Wallonia. 22 A large part of the success in Flanders was due to large regional<lb/> subsidies to municipalities and a special-purpose public private partnership (OECD, 2007c). In 2009, a<lb/> second treatment plant for Brussels was operational, ensuring that the majority of households in the area is<lb/> connected to treatment. Nevertheless, by 2010, Belgium still had not implemented the urban wastewater<lb/> treatment directive, for which it is to be fined. 23 Full compliance is not expected before 2013.<lb/> 22.<lb/> The assessment is done by the European Commission in light of the 1991 Urban Wastewater Treatment<lb/> Directive. Under the legislation, all urban waste water generated by agglomerations of over<lb/> 10 000 inhabitants should be collected and treated before being discharged. Belgium has designated its<lb/> entire national territory as a &quot; sensitive area &quot; , the treatment must be more stringent to significantly reduce<lb/> phosphorous and nitrate levels in waters before they are discharged.<lb/></p>

			<p>Water quality remains poor, with the EU water framework directive not being implemented due to<lb/> gaps in the harmonisation of definitions (among regions), in monitoring and in measures taken. Less than a<lb/> fifth of surface waters were classified as not at risk of fulfilling EU ( &quot; good status &quot; ) targets for 2015, one of<lb/> the poorest performances of the EU15 (<ref type="biblio">EC, 2007 and EEB, 2010</ref>). National classifications for 2007-09<lb/> show very poor surface and ground water quality, particularly in Flanders (UNECE, 2010). After an<lb/> improvement in the early 2000s, non-costal bathing water quality returned to poor levels with 13% of areas<lb/> nationwide (primarily in the south of the country) below minimum standards and monitoring problems<lb/> (EEA, 2009).<lb/> The regional division of powers may complicate the conduct of effective water policies, given that the<lb/> two main river basins do not follow regional borders. While the Belgian governments are co-operating<lb/> within international basin bodies, internal co-ordination failure is particularly visible in the Scheldt basin,<lb/> the recipient of Brussels wastewater (EEB, 2010). Hence, there is a need for either a national body or inter-<lb/>regional bodies responsible for river basins to be created in order to ensure cross-border co-ordination and<lb/> facilitate international co-operation. Such a reform would be in line with the requirements of the EU Water<lb/> directive, which stipulates basin-based river management, but would avoid bureaucratic complications<lb/> arising from separate river-basin authorities in each of the regions.<lb/> Water provision (and sanitation) is a municipality responsibility which is usually delegated to inter-<lb/>municipal organisations. Currently, all three regions have different water pricing schemes, with a free<lb/> quota in Flanders and cheap quotas in the two other regions. All three pricing strategies are based on a<lb/> fixed fee and a variable per-cubic-metre price aimed at reflecting costs of distribution, capital and<lb/> wastewater treatment. The variable price is lower for large users in all three regions. Given the persistent<lb/> problems with assuring adequate treatment, it is likely that the incentives for private investors to provide<lb/> the services are insufficient. This can be improved by reviewing the charges for treatment to ensure<lb/> polluters pay for the marginal generated externality in the case of (large) enterprises (basing the charge on<lb/> pollution content of the discharge, as currently done in Flanders). For households, where monitoring and<lb/> enforcement are likely to be costly, but the pollution load relatively uniform, wastewater treatment charges<lb/> should remain incorporated in the water price, but transferred directly to the treatment provider (which is<lb/> already the case in Flanders) rather than to the general regional budget. Overall this may result in<lb/> increasing the tariff-financing of wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. Finally, more<lb/> competitive forces in treatment provision should be encouraged by lower barriers to entry and wider public<lb/> tendering of contracts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Agriculture is a major source of water pollution<lb/></head>

			<p>Belgian agriculture is among the most intensive in the OECD, with particularly intensive animal<lb/> husbandry and pesticide and synthetic fertiliser use having a negative impact on water quality. Despite<lb/> being a heavy polluter, the sector benefits from extensive subsidies and preferential tax treatment, to a<lb/> higher degree than in many OECD countries (OECD, 2010). In particular, federal subsidies aimed at<lb/> increasing the reliance on bio-fuels (in line with the 20/20/20 goals) come at a high abatement costs (per<lb/> tonne of CO 2 ): EUR 200 in the case of biofuels and EUR 600-800 in the case of ethanol (with extreme<lb/> cases of up to EUR 2 000-4 400, <ref type="biblio">Kutas et al., 2007</ref>). A more efficient strategy would be to impose a strict<lb/> mandatory share of biofuels in the fuel mix, similarly as in the GC market, and allow the market to<lb/> establish the price of individual biofuels. The sector is also fully exempt from excise taxation on fuels and<lb/> road and motor vehicle taxation, hence is exposed to lower incentives in terms of GHG reduction targets.</p>

			<head>24<lb/></head>

			<p>In the area of water pollution, to combat phosphorus and nitrogen pollution from fertilisers regional<lb/> manure management systems introduced over the past decade and have led to substantial improvement<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Gybels et al., 2009</ref>). Additional benefits could be gained from a common system across the country,<lb/> particularly if, as has been proposed in Flanders, a system of tradable manure rights is introduced. In this<lb/> respect, a uniform, country-wide balancing system, with farm-level nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus)<lb/> accounts and quotas, could prove an effective way to curb excessive manure and use of synthetic fertiliser.<lb/> Nutrient surplus above the quota would be subject to taxation. A system of this type is in place in Denmark<lb/> (OECD, 2007b). Finally, excessive pesticide use should be curbed through an externality tax. In the 1990s,<lb/> the eco-tax on pesticides in place in the 1990s, exempted the agricultural sector. This was replaced by a<lb/> federal tax on pesticides, linked to pollution content (by category), which can be considered a step in the<lb/> right direction, and by stricter command and control regulation, with some visible shifts to less polluting<lb/> pesticide. However, the pesticide tax is several times lower for professional users (that is the bulk of users)<lb/> and generally fairly low, in part due to cross-border leakage considerations. 25 As the effectiveness of a<lb/> sales tax on pesticide may be mitigated by cross-border trade due to the small country size, it would ideally<lb/> be co-ordinated with neighbouring countries. If this is not possible, taxing the use of pesticide (rather than<lb/> purchase) should be considered.<lb/></p>

			<head>Environmental tools and policies should be co-ordinated and realigned<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned throughout the paper, the division of environment-related powers and responsibilities in<lb/> Belgium is complex and fragmented. The three regions have a large share of responsibilities concerning<lb/> environmental policies and directly related areas: agriculture, economic policy, energy, transport and R&amp;D<lb/> 24.<lb/> Nevertheless, the majority of agricultural GHG emissions take the form of methane (from enteric<lb/> fermentation and manure management) and nitric oxide (soil and manure management).<lb/> 25.<lb/> A reason sometimes cited to back a higher tax for non-professionals is the fact that they may use pesticides<lb/> in a more harmful way (e.g. due to poor awareness).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2011)63<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 8</ref>). Health care policy, where many of the consequences of environmental developments eventually<lb/> occur, is largely federal, though shared with the (language) communities, which also deal with<lb/> (environmental) education. The federal level has most taxation powers. Each government has sovereign<lb/> powers in its area of decisions there are no mandatory co-ordination or binding crisis-resolution<lb/> instruments, implying the need for intensive co-operation and consultation. A vast number of bodies have<lb/> been formed for this purpose, such as the National Climate Commission in climate change and the<lb/> CONCERE/ENOVER in energy. Moreover, as in other member states, a significant share of<lb/> environmental, agricultural and economic aspects is dealt with at the EU level.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are clear advantages of delegating selected aspects of environmental policies to the regional<lb/> level or potentially even the municipality level, given the better ability to adjust policies to the local needs.<lb/> However, climate change and pollution do not respect borders, and therefore the current set-up increases<lb/> the burden of environmental policies and reduces their effectiveness, thereby making Belgians poorer<lb/> overall:<lb/></p>

			<head>• The bodies responsible for environmental policies do not have the powers to use</head>

			<p>the most cost-<lb/>efficient tools. The regions lack of taxation power, prevents widespread use of externality<lb/> taxation. Instead regions revert to more costly and less effective subsidy measures, which often<lb/> reduce R&amp;D incentives by choosing winning technologies (<ref type="biblio">De Serres et al., 2010</ref>). The result – a<lb/> multitude of instruments often leading to disappointing results, such as in energy efficiency<lb/> investments in housing.<lb/></p>

			<head>• The administrative borders inhibit the implementation of efficient nationwide policies.</head>

			<p>In areas<lb/> such as water policies, air pollution management or transport policies, regional borders are<lb/> unlikely optimal boundaries.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Smaller markets prevent the exploitation of the economies of scale and scope in environmental<lb/></head>

			<p>policies, as visible for instance in the existence of (five) separate regional markets for green<lb/> power certificates, hindering cost-equalisation of renewable energy use across the country.<lb/></p>

			<p>The division of environment-related responsibilities in a federation has been reviewed in a general<lb/> context in the previous Survey (OECD, 2009a). As a conclusion: i) an appropriate division of powers<lb/> should follow the division of responsibilities so that each government body can fulfil its tasks optimally;<lb/> and ii) in areas where significant economies of scale or scope can be reaped, at the minimum close and<lb/> swift co-operation should be ensured and moving competencies to the national level could be beneficial.<lb/> An example of such nation-wide co-operation can be found in case of waste-management (batteries) where<lb/> a single national entity takes care of collection and recycling (OECD, 2007a).<lb/> More rigour in planning and decision-making could facilitate choosing the optimal solutions for<lb/> reaching environmental goals. According to a review of federal climate change policies, the lack of proper<lb/> evaluation of the costs and effects of (federal) measures means that decisions have little to do with<lb/> economic reasoning (<ref type="biblio">Cour des Comptes, 2009</ref>). Independent critical evaluations of regional environmental<lb/> policies and the interaction with policies at different levels are hardly available. In order to introduce more<lb/> economic rationale into environmental policy design, comparable cost benefit analysis (CBA) of all<lb/> important environment-related policies (and major investments above a certain threshold) should become<lb/> mandatory. 26 The independent analysis should apply national guidelines on parameters and methodology<lb/> and include the evaluation and assignment of monetary values to environmental effects, for example on<lb/> human health. Decisions to deviate from the CBA conclusions should be necessarily publicly explained.<lb/> Ex post analysis should follow up on existing and future projects and policies to provide feedback for<lb/> improvement of the CBA tool itself.<lb/> 26.<lb/> At the moment cost benefit analysis (CBA) is generally done at the regional level for investment major<lb/> projects (as this is where they usually occur). Environmental Impact Assessment, an EU requirement, is<lb/> less analytically rigorous and concerns only environmental impact.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 8. How to achieve greener growth in the Belgian federation<lb/> Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in a cost-efficient manner<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Introduce a carbon tax for the sectors not subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (part of industry, transport, housing<lb/> and services). The level of the tax should be in line with emission reduction commitments. Speed up the introduction of<lb/> auctioning of the ETS permits and consider taxing away windfall gains arising from the grandfathering of permits. Scrap<lb/> measures that discourage energy savings (such as exemptions and reductions for large users).<lb/> • Unify green certificates (GC&apos;s) across the country to replace the five currently existing, to benefit from the economies of<lb/> scale and scope and ensure that renewable energy is developed where it is most viable. Consider scrapping the<lb/> minimum prices for various types of renewable energy in order not to promote inefficient technologies and allow the<lb/> market (under the GC scheme) to decide the price and mix of renewable energy.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Encourage investment in renewable energy by removing regulatory obstacles and publishing credible paths for the<lb/> minimum requirements in the energy mix. Consider pursuing the targets for biofuels in a similar system.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Realign excise taxes on fuels with environmental marginal externalities. Take steps towards more uniform taxation of<lb/> different uses of the same fuels. Increase the relative taxation of diesel with respect to gasoline to reduce the diesel bias<lb/> and the associated environmental externalities. Scrap the reimbursement of part of the diesel price for professional use.<lb/> • Implement country-wide road pricing for freight. Link distance-based user charges to associate externalities, including<lb/> pollution (by class of vehicle). Extend the scheme to company cars, and eventually including passenger cars. The<lb/> scheme would benefit from co-ordination with neighbouring countries. Consider congestion charges, particularly around<lb/> Brussels, either independently or as part of road pricing.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Phase out the numerous subsidies to private transport in order not to encourage moving away from the workplace or the<lb/> excessive use of cars. The commuting allowance, particularly for road transport, should be focused on persons otherwise<lb/> at risk of dropping out of the job market, and could take the form of a lump-sum allowance.<lb/> • Increase the flexibility and demand-responsiveness of public transport to increase its attractiveness through better<lb/> co-ordination among regions and the federal train system, lower entry barriers, public tendering and the possibility for<lb/> operators to propose new routes.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Drastically reduce the numerous subsidies for energy efficiency investment in housing and for industry. At the least, make<lb/> sure that measures at different levels of government are co-ordinated in order to reach targets. Focus measures on<lb/> liquidity constrained low-income households. Improve the energy efficiency awareness among households.<lb/> • Phase out the social energy tariffs and VAT reductions in order to expose households to the same marginal energy<lb/> saving incentives. Replace these with income subsidies for low income households.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improve water quality<lb/></head>

			<p>• Delegate responsibilities for water policies to an independent national authority or river-basin authorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Review wastewater treatment charges to ensure polluters pay the full marginal costs of environmental externalities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Encourage more competitive provision of wastewater treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Introduce a pollution-content based pesticide tax on sales or application. Consider a country-wide manure and synthetic<lb/> fertiliser management scheme, with balancing farm-level accounts and quotas for nutrients.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The organisation of environmental policies needs to promote cost-efficiency<lb/> • Increase the reliance on taxation of environmental externalities (rather than subsidies or command and control measures)<lb/> to implement environmental policies.<lb/> • Reconsider the division of environmental responsibilities and powers in the federation with an aim of assuring: that the<lb/> responsible bodies have the most cost-efficient tools to achieve their goals (e.g. taxation powers); and the exploitation of<lb/> the economies of scale and scope (e.g. in renewable energy).<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Increase the role of economic considerations in environmental policies by introducing compulsory cost-benefit analysis for<lb/> major investment projects and policies. Agree on national guidelines on parameters and methodology and follow up with<lb/> ex post analysis.</p>
