			<p>Patent data provide an increasingly used means to analyse innovation performance worldwide<lb/> including in countries with incomplete data coverage, such as some developing countries. This paper<lb/> focuses on the construction of indicators and analytical methodologies for measuring innovation in<lb/> climate-and other environment-related technologies. A companion paper discusses the use of such<lb/> indicators for policy purposes (see Haščič and Migotto 2015).<lb/></p>

			<p>More generally, there is a growing demand for analysis of patenting and innovation performance<lb/> worldwide including in countries with incomplete data coverage, such as some developing countries<lb/> (see e.g., <ref type="biblio">Collier and Venables 2012; Belward et al. 2011; Barton 2007</ref>). However, past analyses have<lb/> not properly taken into account the varying geographic coverage of patent databases (including those<lb/> by the authors of this paper). This paper builds on the first attempts to reflect upon this issue in <ref type="biblio">Haščič<lb/> et al. (2012)</ref>. Although the sources of idiosyncrasy are discussed in the context of the EPO&apos;s<lb/> PATSTAT database, similar approaches could be used to mitigate biases arising out of other patent<lb/> databases.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, patent data are increasingly used for international comparisons and analysis in<lb/> relatively &apos;narrow&apos; fields of technology, such as many environment-related technologies (see e.g.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">OECD 2011, 2012; Dechezleprêtre et al. 2011</ref>). However, achieving both comparability across<lb/> countries and representativity within a country (statistical robustness) creates additional challenges.<lb/> Although several approaches have been developed to improve cross-country comparability of patent<lb/> statistics, these are not always suitable for such analyses – either because they require additional data<lb/> that might not be available in all countries or because they impose restrictions that are less appropriate<lb/> for analysis of narrow technological fields. The simultaneity of these two conditions – narrow<lb/> technological scope and comparability across a wide range of countries – often renders many existing<lb/> indicators inapt for such analyses.<lb/> This paper first discusses why different patent indicators might be more or less suitable to<lb/> achieve the two objectives simultaneously. It then advocates the use of indicators based on patent<lb/> family size that are more flexible and can be adapted for such applications, provided that certain<lb/> idiosyncratic characteristics of patent databases are addressed. The following section discusses in<lb/> detail these idiosyncratic characteristics of patent databases that are of general relevance (unequal<lb/> country and temporal coverage of patent databases, asymmetric information on designation of member<lb/> states in regional and PCT applications) as well as those that are of relevance particularly for narrow<lb/> technological fields (missing information, identification of relevant patent documents). The paper<lb/> proposes approaches to mitigating potential biases arising out of such idiosyncrasies – both in<lb/> construction of patent statistics (treatment of underlying data) as well as in empirical analyses that use<lb/> such statistics. In particular, it advocates the use of a robust control variable (e.g. TOTPAT) for cross-<lb/>country analyses of narrow technological fields. All methodological issues discussed here and<lb/> examples provided are based on the PATSTAT database, but could be applied to patent databases<lb/> more generally.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> ADAPTING PATENT INDICATORS TO DIFFERENT CONTEXTS<lb/></head>

			<p>Many of the existing patent indicators, including counts of patent applications registered at a<lb/> given national or regional patent office, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, or the triadic<lb/> patent family (TPF) indicator, have one or both of the following shortcomings: i) either they are not<lb/> suitable for international comparisons; and/or b) they are less suitable for analysis of narrow<lb/> technological fields. The joint existence of two requirements on the indicators – comparability across<lb/> countries and statistical robustness – often renders these indicators inappropriate for many<lb/> applications. The reasons range from a home bias in national and regional filings, differences in<lb/> propensities to use the PCT route (a special type of a home bias) 1 , to an overly restrictive quality<lb/> threshold applied precisely to address cross-country differences in patent quality (such as the TPF).<lb/> Moreover, much of the complementary data that is commonly used to assess patent value (e.g. citation<lb/> data) are currently available only in a very limited number of countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>To illustrate the differences, Figures 1-3 give examples of alternative patent indicators for<lb/> technological fields of different &apos;thickness&apos; and for different geographical scales. Four alternative<lb/> indicators are shown – PCT applications, TPF applications, &quot; claimed priorities &quot; (equivalent to patent<lb/> family size&gt;=2, or PF2) and all priorities (equivalent to patent family size&gt;=1, or PF1). 2<lb/></p>

			<p>Given our reliance upon data obtained from a source which does not include the full population<lb/> of patented inventions within a given field (see below) we do not have any external measure against<lb/> which we can assess which statistic is optimal. However, in order to assess the reliability of the use of<lb/> alternative statistics as indicators of inventive activity, and their suitability for empirical analysis it is<lb/> interesting to compare: a) the degree of correlation between alternative measures; b) the extent of<lb/> variation within fields over time and across countries; and, c) the presence of zero values.<lb/></p>

			<p>To measure inventive activity worldwide in relatively &apos;thick&apos; fields – several of the indicators<lb/> seem satisfactory (for instance, see renewable energy and water pollution abatement in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The<lb/> different measures are highly correlated, and at the country-level the variation is &apos;plausible &quot; for most<lb/> countries. The situation changes with a focus on narrower technological fields (e.g. wind power,<lb/> geothermal energy) which compromises performance of the most restrictive versions of these<lb/> indicators. For example, in the case of geothermal energy, the frequency of zero counts is so high that<lb/> it limits the information value of the TPF indicator (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> These problems are accentuated when the geographic scope is reduced. Focusing on individual<lb/> countries results in high frequency of zero counts for all but the largest inventor countries (Figures 2-<lb/>3) Indeed, even for thick fields some of the more restrictive counts (e.g. TPF and PF2) give relatively<lb/> low variation at the country level (<ref type="figure">Figures</ref> 2 and 3).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In general, PF2 seems as a suitable compromise between comparability (quality threshold) and<lb/> practicality (variance), except for very narrow technological fields or small inventor countries – in<lb/> which case PF1 might be the only option.<lb/></p>

			<p>In sum, while restricting patent family size is a useful way to impose a certain quality threshold<lb/> across countries (<ref type="biblio">Dernis et al. 2001</ref>), the TPF condition of a specific EP-US-JP triad (<ref type="biblio">Dernis and Khan<lb/> 2004</ref>) is overly restrictive and potentially biased for the contexts discussed here. In such cases, it<lb/> might be better to relax this restriction and instead adjust it depending on the application. While for<lb/> some applications no restriction will be the only option (PF1), for others the dyadic (any office, or<lb/> PF2) restriction might be feasible, and cases of particularly &quot; thick &quot; technological fields or broad<lb/> geographic scopes will permit imposing the triadic (any office, or PF3) restriction, or higher. For these<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/> reasons, this paper advocates the use of a range of patent family indicators, as a generalization of the<lb/> TPF concept.<lb/> It must be noted that PF3 differs from the TPF indicator in two respects – (i) the TPF requires a<lb/> specific triad (EP-US-JP) while PF3 can include any triad; (ii) the TPF is based on an extended patent<lb/> family while PF3 is based on simple patent family. It would be a natural extension of the TPF concept<lb/> to define a &quot; dyadic patent family &quot; (DPF) indicator as a dyad, perhaps any dyad of two offices. This<lb/> would however require addressing the problem of regional and international patent filings (see Section<lb/> 3 for a discussion).<lb/></p>

			<p>For the purpose of international comparisons, patent statistics based on counting distinct patent<lb/> families (patent priorities) are preferable for several reasons: (i) considering only priority applications<lb/> (and not their duplicates) avoids double-counting – which would occur if data from multiple patent<lb/> offices were pooled. The data is thus better suited for cross-country analysis; (ii) the data are truly<lb/> world-wide in their coverage – and thus less subject to bias – because the entire stock of patent<lb/> priorities is considered (see also <ref type="biblio">de Rassenfosse et al. 2013). 4<lb/></ref> In addition, a subset of these statistics – those based on counting only the &apos;claimed priorities&apos; (i.e.<lb/> patent priorities that have been &apos;claimed&apos; as a priority by another patenting filing abroad) provides a<lb/> quality threshold because priority applications which have never been claimed (singletons) are<lb/> excluded. This helps contain concerns over low-value and strategic patenting. Counting the claimed<lb/> priorities gives rise to the PF2 statistic (i.e. patent families with size 2 or greater).<lb/> It turns out that for many applications related to environmental technologies, the PF2 restriction<lb/> (claimed priorities) is particularly suitable in order to achieve the dual purpose of comparability and<lb/> robustness. The count of claimed priorities (i.e. patent applications deposited at any office world-wide,<lb/> that have been claimed as priority elsewhere in the world) is a suitable statistic for the purpose of<lb/> international comparisons because only the priority applications protecting &quot; high-value &quot; invention are<lb/></p>

			<figure>The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/></figure>

			<p>counted. The reason that claimed priorities can be viewed as representing inventions of higher value is<lb/> that patenting is costly (e.g. translation and maintenance fees). As such, a firm will only go abroad to<lb/> protect its intellectual property if it expects that the commercial value of its invention justifies it.<lb/> Previous research has shown that the number of additional patent applications (other than the priority<lb/> application) is a good indicator of patent value (<ref type="biblio">Guellec and van Pottelsberghe 2000; Harhoff et al.<lb/> 2003</ref>). The results in <ref type="biblio">Guellec &amp; van Pottelsberghe (2000)</ref> suggest that patent value increases up to<lb/> family size of 4 (or 5), and decreases thereafter. However, few patent applications have family size<lb/> greater than five.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The use of claimed priorities based on an economic threshold criterion was advocated already by<lb/> Faust and Schedl 1983 and Faust 1990. For example, Faust (1990) argued that by excluding priority<lb/> applications which have never been claimed abroad (singletons) this approach will exclude the large<lb/> number of exclusively domestic Japanese patent applications with usually only one claim. 5<lb/></figure>

			<p>Moreover, counts of claimed priorities (PF2 statistics) have the advantage that they do not suffer<lb/> from biases due to changing publication practices at the USPTO. Prior to 2001, only grants (not<lb/> applications) were published by the USPTO. Even after 2001, the rules allow applicants to opt-out<lb/> from having their patent applications made public before grant (i.e. the non-publication request).<lb/> These distinctions between grants and applications create biases in cross country comparisons when<lb/> using the PF1 statistic. This is a limitation of using PF1 statistics compared with PF2, PF3, etc. that<lb/> do not suffer from such bias.<lb/></p>

			<p>The downside of counting claimed priorities is the duplication lag that weighs more on indicators<lb/> with higher minimum family size. Another potential problem for determining family size is the<lb/> question of how to treat applications filed through the regional (EP, AP) and international (PCT)<lb/> routes. For example, should a regional application have an equal weight as a national application (e.g.<lb/> treating EPO as a single jurisdiction), or should it rather be taken to represent individual member<lb/> states? In the latter case how should the individual weights be determined? 6 This is similar to the<lb/> problem of &apos;nowcasting&apos; PCT applications in international phase towards national/regional phase. And<lb/> again, should PCT applications in national/regional phase have an equal weight as a national<lb/> application, or should a weight be estimated? We propose a solution in Section 3.2 below.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the PF2 is indeed often a good compromise between the too restrictive TPF and the too lax<lb/> count of all priorities (PF1), in some circumstances PF1 can be the only practical approach – e.g. for<lb/> very narrow technological fields or for analysis requiring a high degree of spatial disaggregation. This<lb/> approach can be generalized by allowing the analyst to choose the degree of restriction – the number<lb/> of unique countries (patent offices) within a simple patent family – the minimum &apos;quality&apos; threshold<lb/> that still allows for sufficient variation in the measured statistic (avoids too many zeros). The choice of<lb/> the restriction is then a function of &apos;scope&apos; (narrow vs thick) of the technological field analysed,<lb/> geographic coverage, as well as country context (propensity to protect inventions abroad). However,<lb/> construction of a reliable indicator also requires addressing a certain number of potential pitfalls<lb/> associated with patent databases. They are discussed next.<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> IDIOSYNCRATIC ISSUES IN CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF PATENT<lb/> STATISTICS<lb/> 3.1<lb/> Country and temporal coverage of patent databases<lb/></head>

			<p>Analyses using patent data have typically focused on OECD countries for which data availability<lb/> is generally satisfactory. However, the recent growing interest in developing countries raises the<lb/> importance of idiosyncrasies arising out of unequal database coverage which often varies highly<lb/> among countries worldwide. Accounting for such idiosyncrasies is all the more important for analyses<lb/> that study narrow technological fields because the high level of disaggregation leads to high frequency<lb/> of zero (or very low) counts.<lb/> Ideally, one would need information on the representativeness of PATSTAT with respect to<lb/> national registers. In the absence of such information, we use the EPO&apos;s weekly updates of the<lb/> &quot; contents and coverage of the DOCDB bibliographic file &quot; – the DOCDB is the source database from<lb/> which a &apos;snapshot&apos; is drawn biannually and released as PATSTAT. The April 2012 release of<lb/> PATSTAT includes batches of data provided from as many as 94 different patent offices, including all<lb/> major patent offices worldwide. This is shown as cumulative coverage in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. However, for some<lb/> offices the time series are incomplete and thus the contemporaneous coverage (for a given year) is<lb/> typically somewhat lower. The apparent drop in coverage in recent years is most likely only a<lb/> temporary phenomenon because some batches of new data are included with a lag. On-going efforts of<lb/> the EPO to acquire historical batches of data would shift the curves upward, and bring them closer<lb/> together.<lb/></p>

			<p>This is a wealth of information from a large number of patent offices. However, given the<lb/> unequal coverage across countries/offices and over time, the question is how to use this body of data<lb/> for statistical analysis. Clearly, &apos;raw&apos; patent counts that do not account for the unequal coverage<lb/> should be interpreted with caution, particularly those with emphasis on countries and time periods for<lb/> which the coverage is incomplete. Moreover, while country coverage is an important piece of<lb/> information to assess patenting trends in general, it is particularly so with respect to developing<lb/> countries for whom the coverage varies most.<lb/></p>

			<p>The bias might be particularly important with respect to statistics of market protection (number of<lb/> patent applications deposited at a national office). Implications for invention and co-invention<lb/> indicators are less acute since some of this information can be obtained indirectly through other IP<lb/> offices.<lb/></p>

			<head>Using coverage weights to generate more reliable patent statistics<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper we take a step towards developing a methodology to account for differences in<lb/> coverage. The detailed metadata described above can be used for this purpose and improve the<lb/> reliability and representativeness of patent statistics. In particular, our intention is twofold:<lb/></p>

			<table>i)<lb/> Identify cases when one can reliably distinguish &apos;true&apos; zero counts from &apos;missing&apos; values.<lb/> As explained above, benefits of doing so are particularly high for analyses of narrow<lb/> technological fields and of countries with low levels of patenting activity (e.g. many<lb/> developing countries);<lb/> ii)<lb/> In cases when values are not missing, the intention is to provide an indication of reliability<lb/> of the observed frequency counts. Again, this is important in data-poor environments,<lb/> The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/> 18<lb/> including those of narrow technological fields or countries with relatively low levels of<lb/> patenting activity.<lb/></table>

			<p>We use the PATSTAT metadata to develop coverage weights to accompany standard patent data<lb/> extractions. In some sense, the weights will give the probability that the frequency counts obtained<lb/> from PATSTAT reflect the &apos;true&apos; count. For example, one can reasonably expect that if the coverage<lb/> metadata indicate than no data batches were included in PATSTAT from patent office in country X,<lb/> then the probability to have records of duplicates deposited at this country&apos;s office will be zero or very<lb/> low (for singleton priorities it will indeed be zero) and for claimed priorities it will be low but non-<lb/>zero. This approach will allow choosing the minimum level of coverage that is desired or appropriate<lb/> for a given application (i.e. it allows sample selection).<lb/> First, we summarize the information provided by the EPO in the &quot; contents and coverage of<lb/> DOCDB bibliographic files &quot; and construct a statistic that represents the fraction of a given year for<lb/> which PATSTAT has batches of data from a given patent office, ranging between &quot; 0 &quot; (office i in year<lb/> t not covered at all) and &quot; 1 &quot; (full coverage) (e.g. if data is available only for 3 months of a year ten<lb/> weight=0.25). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> gives the weights for offices with at least a partial coverage.<lb/></p>

			<p>Second, we define a set of rules to assign these &quot; coverage weights &quot; to different types of patent<lb/> documents extracted from PATSTAT (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). On the one hand, any information derived from a<lb/> singleton patent application will be assigned a weight corresponding to the coverage of its priority<lb/> application office. The weight is equal to the theoretical coverage of the priority application office in<lb/> the application year. On the other hand, information derived from a family of patent applications<lb/> (claimed priorities) is assigned a weight corresponding to maximum weight associated with the<lb/> priority and/or duplicate application offices of corresponding family members. And finally,<lb/> information derived from duplicate patent applications due to absence of data from the priority office<lb/> is assigned a weight corresponding to the duplicate application office.<lb/></p>

				<formula>Duplicate application<lb/> w<lb/> DUPL<lb/></formula>

			<p>The unequal country coverage has only a limited effect on our ability to identify inventions that<lb/> have sought protection elsewhere (&apos;claimed priorities&apos;), because we can impute inventor information<lb/> from other members of the same patent family whose coverage might be superior. However, it does<lb/> potentially compromise our ability to identify inventions that have sought protection only in one<lb/> jurisdiction (singletons) with incomplete coverage, or duplicate applications of foreign patents<lb/> (duplicates) registered in jurisdictions with incomplete coverage.<lb/> It must be noted that the approach presented here has certain limitations: First, the coverage<lb/> weights as derived here represent only the direct coverage of countries in PATSTAT. Indirect<lb/> coverage, derived by exploiting information on patent families, is not reflected (see e.g. the lower part<lb/> of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Second, the coverage weights are only assigned to patent offices, not inventor countries<lb/> (this would help with interpretation of the last column in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In both cases, addressing these<lb/> issues would require estimating such propensities econometrically. However, this would require<lb/> access to data external to PATSTAT.<lb/> Third, we generate frequency counts along selected vectors – by office, inventor country, priority<lb/> or application year, technology, as well as the coverage weight. This allows making judgements about<lb/> the reliability of observed patent counts, notably to:<lb/> • Identify &apos;true zeros&apos; – i.e. when patent count=0 and coverage weight=1 (or close to 1). Such<lb/> distinction between &apos;true zeros&apos; and &apos;missing values is otherwise not possible.<lb/> • Identify nonzero counts with &apos;low reliability&apos; – i.e. when patent count&gt;0 and weight&lt;1 (or<lb/> far from 1). In some cases, one might observe a positive count and a zero coverage weight at<lb/> the same time. Such counts arise through &apos;indirect&apos; channels discussed above, and should be<lb/> considered as significant underestimates. Among other things, this allows selecting a data<lb/> sample based on a minimum threshold value of coverage. For example, consider only those<lb/> counts derived from information that is 95% complete. However, applying such a &apos;filter&apos;<lb/> might involve a trade-off between geographical scope and data quality.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Protection in national jurisdictions through regional (international) patent filings<lb/></head>

			<p>Regional IP offices play a more-or-less important role in the world. For example, patenting at the<lb/> European Patent Office (EPO) is an increasingly important route of protecting IP rights in Europe.<lb/> Similarly, patenting at the two African regional IP offices (ARIPO, OAPI) also plays an important<lb/> role. 10 However, based on a regional application it is difficult to infer the true protection strategy of a<lb/> patentee. As a consequence, when constructing patent indicators researchers frequently either treat<lb/> EPO and other regional filings as if they were equivalent to national applications or simply set them<lb/> aside as if they never existed. 11<lb/></p>

			<p>To address the potential biases, in this paper we propose a method to account for filings at the<lb/> EPO by estimating the &quot; protection propensities &quot; . We then use the propensities to apportion EPO<lb/> counts onto national jurisdictions. And while here we focus on the EPO, this approach could<lb/> potentially be extended to other regional offices subject to data availability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Apportionment of EPO patent filings using protection propensities<lb/></head>

			<p>There are several potential sources of data that are potentially useful for inferring patentee&apos;s<lb/> market protection strategies, including (a) list of designated states using the PAT_EP database – a<lb/> straightforward but not satisfactory solution because designation rules have changed over time and<lb/> certain countries are designated &apos;by default&apos; reducing the value of such data; (b) publication kind<lb/> codes in PATSTAT that identify grants of patents – while recent additions to PATSTAT have made<lb/> this approach more convenient 12 , it is not clear whether a validation of an EP patent in a member state<lb/> is always associated with a corresponding record in PATSTAT; and (c) payment of validation and<lb/> maintenance fees – the major conceptual upside is that the data should be a reliable indicator of<lb/> patentees&apos; preferences because they are associated with financial cost. The latter approach is discussed<lb/> next.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper, we use the European Patent Office&apos;s Inpadoc Legal Status database, also called<lb/> Patent Register Service (PRS) Legal Status database, to construct &quot; protection propensities &quot; over time.<lb/> The database contains data from 41 patent granting authorities going back to 1970. It contains over<lb/> 120 million records, each referring to a distinct &quot; legal status event &quot; , identified by a PRS code. The<lb/> great advantage is that the PRS records are linked to PATSTAT.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several PRS codes that are potentially useful as evidence that patent applicants have<lb/> designated, validated and maintained their patent rights in certain EPO member states against payment<lb/> of fees.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper we use data on post-grant fee payment (PGFP) to calculate the protection propensity<lb/> (other alternatives that were also considered are summarized in the Annex). The major advantage of<lb/> PGFP is that the data should be complete because patent offices have an interest in maintaining<lb/> reliable records of fee payments; however, we identify several years and offices for which data in the<lb/> PRS database are missing or appear incomplete. 13 Another potential downside is the time lag due to<lb/> granting of a patent and fee payment which causes problems for generating timely statistics.<lb/> Therefore, we cannot calculate the protection propensities for the specific subset of relevant patents;<lb/> instead we do so for all patents (PATSTAT total).</p>

			<figure>More formally, the protection propensity is<lb/> calculated as the ratio of a frequency count of EP applications that enter the national phase in a<lb/> given member state as evidenced by payment of post-grant fees, and the frequency count of all<lb/> (distinct) EP applications with PGFP evidence from any state. The protection propensity thus<lb/> shows how often a typical EP application truly sought protection in a given member state (the sum of<lb/> the propensities is thus more than 100%). We construct such propensities for all member states for the<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/></figure>

			<p>time period starting with the year when they joined the EPO (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). Propensities for selected<lb/> offices are also shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.<lb/> The propensities implied by this statistic seem to be of reasonable magnitudes. Overall, four<lb/> broad groups of member states can be distinguished: (i) the most frequently protected countries with<lb/> propensities close to 50%, including Germany, the United Kingdom and France, and followed by Italy<lb/> (about 30%); (ii) mid-size markets with propensities between 10% and 20%, including Netherlands,<lb/> Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, and Spain; (iii) smaller markets with propensities between 1%<lb/> and 10%, including markets with stable propensities over time (e.g. Greece, Ireland, Portugal) as well<lb/> as more dynamic markets whose propensities are growing quickly (e.g. Turkey, Finland, Poland); and<lb/> finally (iv) markets with propensities of less than 1%.<lb/> Note that over time there has been a progressive move from single country designation to<lb/> automatic designation of eventually all EPO members in EPO applications after 2004. The legalistic<lb/> interpretation would thus lead to apportioning all EPO member countries to every EPO application<lb/> after 2004. However, such automatic (or default) list of designated countries inflates the &quot; true &quot;<lb/> intentions of the applicants. Instead, in this paper we adopt the economic interpretation and seek to<lb/> approximate what markets applicants really care about. Our objective is to apportion an EPO filing<lb/> only to those member states where the applicant truly seeks to protect the invention. Evidence of post-<lb/>grant fee payment is thus a suitable option.<lb/></p>

Propensity to protect in an EPO member state (PGFP, 3-year MA)<lb/></figure>

			<p>In this paper, the protection propensities are generated only over time, assuming that all patent<lb/> applicants in a given year are homogeneous with respect to protection propensities. This could be<lb/> refined further by allowing the propensities to vary not only over time but also across priority office as<lb/> well as duplicate office, inventor country or applicant country (although such information is<lb/> sometimes missing, reducing the sample size). EPO applications could then be apportioned along all<lb/> these vectors.<lb/> The PRS data necessarily involve certain time lags. Therefore, in this paper we construct<lb/> summary statistics of protection propensities for TOTPAT and apply these on EPAT. This is based on<lb/> the assumption that protection propensities do not vary systematically across technological fields. We<lb/></p>

			<p>thus use the full sample of PRS data (all patents, not only environmental) to calculate the propensities.<lb/> We then apply the propensities on the &quot; environmental &quot; counts and apportion EPO applications onto<lb/> national patent offices of the member countries (as unit counts, not fractionally). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the<lb/> evolution over time of national and EP-apportioned patenting activity in air pollution abatement<lb/> technologies for selected countries. An alternative approach would be to estimate the protection<lb/> propensities econometrically as a function of characteristics of patent applicants, inventors, priority<lb/> office, and technological field, and then nowcast the recent years.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6. Patenting activity at the national office versus EP-apportioned filings<lb/></figure>

			<p>In sum, construction of &apos;protection propensities&apos; allows apportioning of regional patent filings<lb/> onto national jurisdictions, and thus allows to correct for the drop in national patenting caused by<lb/> growing tendency to protect inventions at the regional rather than national authorities. Subject to<lb/> availability of protection data, this methodology could be extended to other regional offices.<lb/> Such EPO protection propensities can be useful for at least two types of applications. First, the<lb/> propensities can be used to estimate patent family size when constructing patent family-based<lb/> indicators. Consider the following example using data from <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Summing across protection<lb/> propensities of all EPO member states in a given year yields the &quot; aggregate propensity &quot; – that is, the<lb/> average size of an EP patent family. For most of the 1990-2012 period the aggregate propensity varies<lb/> between 2.5 and 3.2 (last row in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). For example, in year 2000 this is estimated to be 3.082, so a<lb/> singleton application deposited in that year at the EPO corresponds, on average, to a patent family<lb/> with an approximate family size of 3. However, if PATSTAT also contains a trace of a German family<lb/> member then the German application must contribute its full weight (unity) rather than its estimated<lb/> weight in that year (1 rather than 0.553). Therefore, the equivalent size of such patent family is<lb/> approximately 3.5 (Table 6 summarises this example).<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 6. Estimation of patent family size using EP protection propensities<lb/> Observed family<lb/> Estimated family size in year 2000<lb/> EP singleton<lb/> 3.082<lb/> EP + DE<lb/> 3.082 -0.553 + 1 = 3.530<lb/> EP + US<lb/> 3.082 + 1 = 4.082<lb/></table>

			<p>Second, the protection propensities can be used to apportion patenting activity onto national<lb/> jurisdictions of EPO member states, for example to construct patent stocks to be used in empirical<lb/> analyses (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3<lb/> Missing information<lb/></head>

			<p>For narrow technological fields, small inventor countries, or countries with low levels of<lb/> patenting activity – that is, situations with frequent zeros and generally low patent counts – increasing<lb/> the &apos;yield&apos; of patent data extractions is valuable. However, this should be done in a manner that<lb/> minimizes a potential bias in the analysis (this will be discussed in Section 4 below).<lb/></p>

			<head>Imputing missing information on inventors<lb/></head>

			<p>One way to increase the magnitude and variation of counts is to impute missing inventor<lb/> information. While basic bibliographic information such as application authority and application date<lb/> is always available in patent databases, additional descriptive information such as name and address of<lb/> the inventor(s) and applicant(s) are often missing or incomplete. To mitigate this problem we retrieve<lb/> inventor data for all patent family members and impute from duplicate applications information on<lb/> inventor countries that is not listed in the priority document. The imputed inventor information is then<lb/> stored at the level of the priority because it is common to all members of the single-priority patent<lb/> family. This typically allows increasing the volume of data with known inventor information by 3 to 4<lb/> percentage points (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). 14<lb/> While technically the same imputation procedure could be conducted to mitigate missing<lb/> applicant information, conceptually it might be preferable to retain all sets of applicant data within a<lb/> family because applicants might be different for each patent application, i.e. due to change of<lb/> ownership.<lb/></p>

			<head>Imputing missing information on patent classifications<lb/></head>

			<p>Another source of missing information are missing classification symbols. For search strategies<lb/> defined in terms of IPC symbols, the yield can be increased by searching also in the APPLN_ECLA<lb/> (more recently APPLN_CPC) table in addition to APPLN_IPC table. This is because EPO examiners<lb/> often assign ECLA symbols even to foreign filings if they consider that the existing classifications are<lb/> not sufficient or appropriate. For example, in the case of wastewater treatment technologies this allows<lb/> increasing the volume of data by 3 percentage points compared with a search conducted only in the<lb/> APPLN_IPC table (<ref type="table">Table 8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Expansion of patent families<lb/></head>

			<p>To construct patent families, we proceed in three steps. First, the patent database is searched for<lb/> the relevant (e.g. &quot; green &quot; or &quot; environment-related &quot; ) patents using a given definition – a search<lb/> strategy. Second, we search for potential family members outside of this subset of documents using<lb/> the DOCDBFAM table that gives patent applications protecting the same set of claims. Third, we<lb/> identify priority relationships within this enlarged subset of patent documents.<lb/></p>

			<p>This approach also helps to mitigate the bias historically created by the distinction between core-<lb/>and advanced-level IPC classes and the differentiated obligations of patent offices to classify in the<lb/> latter (only patent offices in the &quot; PCT-minimum requirements &quot; are mandated to classify at the<lb/> advanced level). Hence, when a search strategy is based on advanced-level IPC symbols (which is<lb/> almost always the case), small patent offices that only classify at the core level would be under-<lb/>represented in the searches. The next Section discusses this issue in greater detail.<lb/></p>

			<head>Constructing variables to normalize (or control for) missing information<lb/></head>

			<p>While strategies to impute missing information are valuable because they increase the &quot; yield &quot; of<lb/> patent extractions, they too might introduce potential biases in analysis. So both, the presence of<lb/> missing information, as well as imputation thereof, might give rise to biases. One way to mitigate<lb/> them is to generate a corresponding count of patent &quot; totals &quot; (so-called TOTPAT). By corresponding<lb/> we mean a statistic that is constructed in a manner that is identical to the &quot; environmental &quot; count<lb/> (EPAT) with the one exception that all documents (not only &quot; environmental &quot; ) are considered. For<lb/> example, if missing information on inventors is imputed, this should be done identically for EPAT as<lb/> for TOTPAT. Ways in which such TOTPAT variable can be used for the purposes of normalization in<lb/> descriptive analyses or as a control variable in econometric analyses will be discussed in Section 4<lb/> below.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields<lb/> 3.4<lb/> Non-systematic classification of patent documents<lb/></head>

			<p>Assignment of patent classification symbols to patented inventions is not homogeneous across<lb/> patent offices and this is another potential source of idiosyncratic biases in patent analysis. Questions<lb/> arise concerning the best ways to apply a given search strategy to identify the relevant patents in a<lb/> patent database; and, how to identify the relevant population, or a relevant subset in an unbiased<lb/> manner? 15<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of the international patent classification system (IPC) varies across offices to a certain<lb/> extent. For example, while patent offices listed in the &quot; PCT minimum requirements &quot; are obliged to<lb/> assign IPC symbols at the &apos;advanced&apos; level, other patent offices must do so only at the &apos;core&apos; level<lb/> although in practice they might assign advanced level symbols in areas of particular interest. This is<lb/> important because search strategies for narrow technological fields are often based on symbols at the<lb/> advanced level of IPC. Such heterogeneous practices in assignment of IPC symbols thus create a<lb/> potential source of a bias.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even more importantly, many national patent offices have developed their own patent<lb/> classification systems (ECLA, USPC, F-terms, etc.) to classify patent applications, the related prior<lb/> art, and perhaps patents in selected domains that are of specific interest to their respective countries. In<lb/> any case, the national patent classification symbols are assigned only to a certain subset of the world&apos;s<lb/> &quot; population &quot; of patent applications. For example, the EPO uses the ECLA symbols 16 to systematically<lb/> classify all patent documents from the &quot; PCT minimum requirements &quot; in one of the EPO official<lb/> languages (incl. German, English and French), with documents filed in other languages (e.g. Japanese,<lb/> Russian, Spanish) are excluded. Patent documents in Dutch (e.g. those filed in the Netherlands,<lb/> Belgium and Luxembourg) are also classified as well as those with first filings residents from Austria,<lb/> Australia and Canada. In addition, Korean, Chinese and Indian documents are classified if they are in<lb/> one of the four EPO languages. Additional documents might be machine-translated if they are in<lb/> selected priority areas (determined based on IPC symbols assigned by home offices). Finally, some<lb/> Japanese documents were classified in the past based on abstracts, and they might be re-classified if a<lb/> subsequent equivalent is published in one of the four EPO languages. 17 The situation is in many<lb/> respects similar, if not &quot; worse &quot; , at other patent offices worldwide because they too face resource<lb/> constraints.<lb/> In sum, while the practice of selective classification in national systems might be economically<lb/> justified, from a researcher&apos;s point of view it creates another potential source of bias. For example,<lb/> while a large majority of patent documents in PATSTAT have an ECLA symbol assigned, it is not true<lb/> of all the patent documents. Therefore, a search strategy that uses an ECLA symbol might yield biased<lb/> results insofar it cannot identify relevant documents among those without an ECLA symbol.<lb/></p>

			<p>The situation is even more complicated with search strategies that use the recently introduced<lb/> Y02 class (so-called Y-tags) developed by the EPO. While this new tagging scheme greatly facilitates<lb/> identification of many climate-related inventions by non-specialists, users should be aware of its<lb/> implications. 18 To be clear, the new tagging scheme does not substitute for the standard ECLA (or<lb/> CPC) classification symbols, rather it is complementary. Technically, the tagging does not involve<lb/> examination of each individual patent application, rather it is constructed as a set of search algorithms<lb/> that exploit the full stock of descriptive attributes in DOCDB 19 , including the IPC and ECLA symbols,<lb/> as well as EPO&apos;s internal schemes of in-computer-only (ICO) classification symbols and keywords<lb/> (KW). In addition, for some technologies keyword searches on English titles and abstracts are<lb/> conducted (either as a single keyword or in combination). Finally, where available, Derwent WPI<lb/> index might be used as well. 20 Therefore, the population of patents from which such searches draw is<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/> unknown (or imperfectly defined, at least). Next we discuss strategies that help mitigate any potential<lb/> biases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Constructing variables to normalize (or control for) non-systematic classification<lb/></head>

			<p>Ideally, every &quot; environmental &quot; patent (EPAT) search strategy needs its own corresponding<lb/> TOTPAT control variable. A researcher using an IPC-based (or ECLA-based) search strategy can<lb/> easily generate a corresponding count of patent &quot; totals &quot; (e.g. all patents with an/any IPC (ECLA)<lb/> symbol assigned). Similarly, if a search strategy is based on English keywords in titles and abstracts,<lb/> then the corresponding TOTPAT would be constructed as a count of all patent families with an<lb/> English-language title or abstract. In these cases, construction of such variables is straightforward<lb/> because the set of patents from which such searches draw is known – PATSTAT allows identifying<lb/> these relevant sets of documents (see <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>). At the aggregate level TOTPAT_IPC and<lb/> TOTPAT_ECLA are highly correlated because as many as 80% of all documents (appln_id&apos;s) in<lb/> PATSTAT have both IPC and ECLA symbols assigned. However, there are important differences at<lb/> the more disaggregated level.<lb/> However, in the case of a Y-based search strategy the set of &quot; potentially identifiable &quot; documents<lb/> is only imperfectly defined, and therefore it is more difficult to generate a corresponding &quot; total &quot; . As<lb/> described above, the set of documents that could have theoretically been searched and assigned a<lb/> given Y-tag is only imperfectly defined. Therefore, constructing TOTPAT_YTAG correctly is an<lb/> impossible task, unless a separate TOTPAT count is generated for every Y-symbol which is in most<lb/> practical uses of patent data too costly. 21 In most practical applications, the researcher might use an<lb/> approximation of TOTPAT_YTAG (#4) based on some combination of the corresponding totals – for<lb/> example, the union of the IPC and ECLA TOTPATs (#5 in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 10. Construction of corresponding totals<lb/> If EPAT search<lb/> strategy is based<lb/> on:<lb/> …then TOTPAT should be<lb/> constructed as:<lb/> Share of appln_id&apos;s<lb/> in PATSTAT<lb/> (1)<lb/> IPC symbols<lb/> All documents (single-priority<lb/> patent families) that are<lb/> &apos;identifiable&apos; using IPC symbols<lb/> (i.e. all appln_id&apos;s listed in the<lb/> APPLN_IPC table).<lb/> 79%<lb/> (2)<lb/> ECLA symbols<lb/> All documents (single priority<lb/> patent families) that are<lb/> &apos;identifiable&apos; using ECLA symbols<lb/> (i.e. all appln_id&apos;s listed in the<lb/> APPLN_ECLA table with EC as<lb/> classification scheme).<lb/> 49%<lb/> (3)<lb/> Keyword searches<lb/> on titles and/or<lb/> abstracts<lb/> All documents (single priority<lb/> patent families) that are<lb/> &apos;identifiable&apos; using keyword<lb/> searches (i.e. all documents with<lb/> title/abstract in the corresponding<lb/> language).<lb/> 58%<lb/> (English)<lb/> (4)<lb/> Y02 tags<lb/> All documents (single-priority<lb/> patent families) that could have<lb/> potentially been tagged by the<lb/> EPO.<lb/> ?<lb/> (this will vary by<lb/> individual Y-symbol)<lb/> (5)<lb/> IPC and ECLA<lb/> symbols<lb/> The union of (1) and (2) above.<lb/> 80%<lb/> (6)<lb/> IPC, ECLA, ICO, or<lb/> English title/abstract<lb/> The union of the respective<lb/> counts.<lb/> 84%<lb/></table>

			<p>For these reasons, and when there is a choice between an IPC-based and Y02-based search<lb/> strategy, it might be preferable to use IPC because it allows correctly specifying the &quot;counterfactual&quot;<lb/> (all patents with and assigned IPC symbol, not only the &apos;environmental&apos; IPC symbol), a task that is<lb/> more difficult (if not impossible) to do for Y-tagging because the individuals to be tagged are not<lb/> drawn randomly from this population (we do not know the &apos;taggable&apos; population). This might be<lb/> particularly important for regions of the world that are not well covered by the Y02 scheme.<lb/> This problem will diminish over time because many of the elements (ECLA, ICO, KW) have<lb/> now become part of the new CPC system. As patent classification systems become increasingly<lb/> harmonised, and the CPC is used more widely, the precision of TOTPAT_YTAG will approach that of<lb/> TOTPAT_CPC. Until then, for research hypotheses where it is of key importance to have a precise<lb/> control (counterfactual) IPC might indeed be the better option.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some cases it might be possible to define a &quot; sectoral total &quot; instead of a &quot; PATSTAT total &quot; as<lb/> discussed above. For example, analysis of electric and hybrid cars patenting can be complemented<lb/> with a &quot; total &quot; count for the entire sector of motor vehicles or road vehicles which it is possible to<lb/> define using IPC symbols (<ref type="biblio">Haščič and Johnstone 2011; see also Aghion et al. 2012</ref>). Similarly,<lb/> analysis of fuel-efficient energy generation technologies can be complemented with a &quot; total &quot; count for<lb/> the entire sector of energy generation from fossil fuel combustion (<ref type="biblio">Lanzi et al. 2011</ref>; Noailly and<lb/> Smeets 2013).<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/> 4.<lb/> IMPLICATIONS FOR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS<lb/> The need for a normalization count (control variable)<lb/></table>

			<p>Dealing with a narrow technological field is both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, this poses<lb/> certain difficulties in terms of indicator construction (Section 2), but on the other hand it allows<lb/> generating a &quot; total &quot; variable that is an appropriate answer to these, and other, difficulties. The<lb/> conceptual justification for the use of such variable is twofold: First, there are conceptual (economic)<lb/> reasons for using a TOTPAT arising out of the need to control for many generic factors that affect<lb/> patenting in a narrow field, including:<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Differences in inventive capacity<lb/> • Differences in propensity to patent<lb/> • Differences in patent breadth and patent &apos;quality&apos;<lb/> • Other factors that might affect patenting in general<lb/></figure>

			<p>Obviously, there might be suitable substitutes for TOTPAT to control for these differences across<lb/> countries, sectors, firms, and over time (while such substitutes may be even better, the data is not<lb/> always readily available). 22<lb/> Second, there is another set of reasons that might be even more important and for which it is<lb/> impossible to substitute with other data. These are the methodological</p>

			<figure>(idiosyncratic) reasons calling<lb/> for the use of a TOTPAT arising out of:<lb/> • Incomplete information due to differences in coverage of patent databases (Section 3.1)<lb/> • Imperfect information on jurisdictions where patent protection is sought through regional<lb/> procedures (Section 3.2)<lb/> • Extent of missing information on inventors, applicants, patent classes (Section 3.3)<lb/> • Non-systematic classification of patent documents (Section 3.4)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Using a TOTPAT variable deals perfectly with the latter (idiosyncratic) sources of biases (except<lb/> for those discussed in 3.4) and imperfectly with the former (conceptual) sources of biases. How<lb/> exactly should such a TOTPAT variable be constructed will depend on three factors:<lb/> i)<lb/> Indicator selected (e.g. PF2 for invention, PF1 for co-invention)<lb/></p>

			<p>ii)<lb/> Search strategy used (e.g. based on IPC, ECLA, keyword searches, or other)<lb/> iii)<lb/> Algorithm used to construct the EPAT count (i.e. treatment of idiosyncrasies, other<lb/> programming details that might affect the final outcome).<lb/></p>

			<p>The corresponding TOTPAT is identical to EPAT in all the three aspects above. It is measured<lb/> using the same indicator (e.g. PF2, TPF, count of co-inventions), based on the same type of search<lb/> strategy (see <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>), and constructed using an otherwise identical algorithm.<lb/> In descriptive analyses, inclusion of a TOTPAT variable provides suitable context and a basis for<lb/> interpretation of trends observed in EPAT. Another option is to &apos;normalize&apos; the EPAT count, for<lb/> example, as a measure of specialisation expressed as a ratio of a country&apos;s share of EPAT on TOTPAT<lb/> over the share of EPAT over TOTPAT worldwide (relative propensity to invent, relative propensity to<lb/> patent) although such measures might be difficult for a layperson to interpret.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, this approach yields the greatest benefits in econometric analyses. Indeed, many of the<lb/> potential biases discussed above can be successfully mitigated by inclusion of a TOTPAT control<lb/> variable (of the same dimensionality as EPAT). Such variable has the potential to partially control for<lb/> changes in patenting propensities over time and across countries and offices, and to correct<lb/> measurement error due to the idiosyncrasies detailed above. In empirical research one might be<lb/> tempted to disregard such potential errors; while they might indeed be negligible in the EU-US space,<lb/> shifting the analysis outside of the OECD countries increases the potential for erroneous conclusions,<lb/> and hence the need to control for potential idiosyncratic biases.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> CONCLUDING REMARKS<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper draws attention to several issues that are specific to analysis of narrow technological<lb/> fields in cross-country international comparisons. Moreover, there is a rising interest in patent analyses<lb/> in developing countries and this raises new types of issues. First, the paper advocates the use of a<lb/> range of patent indicators based on international patent family size. While it concludes that<lb/> determining the &quot; optimal &quot; family size for a given application is largely an empirical question, PF2 or<lb/> higher-order restrictions are preferable than PF1, unless the technological field studied is so narrow<lb/> that this restricts the variation in the data &apos;too much&apos; (too many zeros and low counts). In such cases<lb/> one has no other option but to use PF1. There is indeed a trade-off between patent quality and breadth<lb/> of technological fields studied.<lb/> Second, the paper reviews four types of idiosyncratic problems in the underlying data, including<lb/> how to tell zeros from missings; how to address the problem of regional patent filings; how to increase<lb/> yield of database extractions; and how to face patent identification problems. The paper advocates<lb/> using a normalization (or control) variable constructed in an analogous manner as the indicator of<lb/> primary interest. All patent databases come with a warning – do not blindly estimate on the contents of<lb/> the database!<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/></p>

			<head>NOTES<lb/> 1<lb/></head>

			<p>PCT count is not always a suitable indicator for inter-country comparisons because the propensity to use the<lb/> PCT route varies across countries and over time (even after year 2000). Inventors from different countries vary<lb/> in their likelihood of pursuing the PCT through to the national/regional phase (e.g. 80% for NL, 30% RU and<lb/> KR), and as such PCT counts suffer from their own specific type of &apos;home bias&apos;. It is equivalent to a call option<lb/> rather than a true patent application, and because the initial costs are rather low (esp. in the international phase)<lb/> PCT applications often covers inventions of little value (OECD 2009).<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/></head>

			<p>Working with patent families is essential to avoid double-counting of inventions when patent data from<lb/> multiple patent offices are pooled together. We adopt the notion of single-priority patent family (<ref type="biblio">Martinez 2010</ref>)<lb/> because it facilitates many of the steps discussed herein. We calculate the &quot; international patent family size &quot; –<lb/> that is, the number of distinct patent authorities within a family. As such, we distinguish between 3 types of<lb/> equivalents – singleton priorities, claimed priorities and duplicates.<lb/></p>

			<head>3<lb/></head>

			<p>Claimed priorities with regional weights would yield a &quot; dyadic patent family &quot; indicator.<lb/></p>

			<head>4<lb/></head>

			<p>In the same vein, <ref type="biblio">de Rassenfosse et al. (2013)</ref> advocate a metric based on &quot; a worldwide count of priority<lb/> patents &quot; as a measure of inventive activity (equivalent to PF1 presented here). They highlight the advantages of<lb/> such a measure relative to PCT counts.<lb/></p>

			<head>5<lb/></head>

			<p>Claimed priorities account for a relatively small proportion of the stock of patent applications. For example,<lb/> in a study focusing on innovation in climate change mitigation technologies found that only about 11% of the<lb/> relevant stock of patent applications included in PATSTAT were CPs, with 34% being their duplicates, and 55%<lb/> being singletons (<ref type="biblio">Haščič et al. 2010</ref>). In other words, in climate change mitigation technologies CPs represent<lb/> only 16% of the stock of patented inventions (simple patent families), while the large majority (84%) of these<lb/> inventions were only protected at a single patent office (singletons). It must be noted that there is variation in<lb/> these proportions across patent offices.<lb/></p>

			<head>6<lb/></head>

			<p>Note that account has to be taken of changing membership through time.<lb/></p>

			<head>7<lb/></head>

			<p>For example, former Eastern Germany (DD) complete data until 1999; former Czechoslovakia (CS) complete<lb/> data until 1993, thereafter complete data separately for SK and CZ; former Yugoslavia (YU) data until 1992.<lb/></p>

			<head>OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/> ANNEX<lb/></head>

			<p>We consider four alternative (candidate) statistics based on different combinations of PRS codes and<lb/> publication kind codes as extracted from the PRS dataset (summarized in <ref type="table">Table A1</ref>). The order is<lb/> chronological and most likely it correlates with reliability of the statistic – data obtained close to grant<lb/> reflect patentee&apos;s intentions better than data gathered at the beginning of the patenting process; moreover,<lb/> patentee&apos;s preferences may evolve over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Propensity to pay post-grant fees<lb/> (annual maintenance fees)<lb/> PGFP<lb/> prs_code=PGFP<lb/></head>

			<p>While the data underlying statistic #3 seem as a suitable option, there seems to be a problem of scale.<lb/> Three countries have propensities that approach (or exceed) 90% (Germany, France, UK). While one<lb/> would expect that these countries rank among the most often designated countries, the propensities<lb/> suggested here are surprisingly high. Moreover, several rather minor economies show rather high<lb/> propensities (e.g. Estonia has propensity almost as high as the Czech Republic, and Cyprus is not far from<lb/> Denmark). This indicates that patentees might designate many countries at grant but then do not translate<lb/> the application in the local language (validation) neither pay maintenance fees. Given this, statistic #4 is<lb/> the best option.</p>
