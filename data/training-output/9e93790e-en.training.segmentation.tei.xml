It excludes export credit OOF as its main objective is not developmental.<lb/>• As the purpose of the report is to measure external flows of development partners to developing countries, and as the amounts <lb/>spent by developing country governments for infrastructure in their own countries are not reported to the Development Assistance <lb/>Committee (DAC), the latter is not part of this report 1 .<lb/>• Data covered are mainly those by the 50 major bilateral and multilateral development partners 2 that report to the DAC at the <lb/>activity level in a harmonised manner. Furthermore, the report provides estimates of ODF by emerging economies that do not <lb/>report to the DAC, such as China and India.<lb/>• Recipient countries are those that are on the DAC list of ODA Recipient Countries 3 . Therefore, it excludes, for example, high-income <lb/>European countries that are clients of European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development <lb/>(EBRD).<lb/>• Infrastructure refers to the DAC 5 sectors of 140 (Water &amp; Sanitation), 210 (Transport &amp; Storage), 220 (Communications), and 230 <lb/>(Energy Generation and Supply) in the DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS).<lb/>• The report exclusively measures financial flows to the public and private sectors, i.e., loans, grants and equity. As a consequence, <lb/>it does not take account of guarantees, which are not actual flows. However, there is an on-going discussion in the DAC on how <lb/>to better capture the coverage of guarantees.<lb/>• Absolute amounts of ODF in this report are generally on a disbursement basis and not in commitments. The reason is that <lb/>commitments are recorded in total in the particular year they are signed, i.e. once the commitment has been reported, it is not <lb/>repeated again in subsequent years, although it may be spent over several years. Furthermore, since different projects usually <lb/>have different years of planned disbursements, aggregates of committed amounts would be an accumulation of projects with <lb/>different number of years of implementation. As such, disbursements are more comparable with annual expenditure figures, for <lb/>example, national budgets, annual infrastructure spending, gross national income (GNI), and so on.<lb/>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION <lb/>T <lb/>he 2030 Agenda and the related financing framework emphasise the need for developing countries to fill the significant <lb/>infrastructure gap in order to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, development partners are increasingly <lb/>contributing to this agenda by directly providing financial assistance, helping improve the delivery of infrastructure services and <lb/>mobilising resources from the private sector. Given the importance of filling the large financing gap, it is crucial to gauge the contribution <lb/>from all sources to infrastructure of developing countries, including from development partners. <lb/>In this respect, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting and analysing financial data of major bilateral <lb/>and multilateral development partners to infrastructure. The aims of this work include contributing to the monitoring of the SDGs 9 on <lb/>infrastructure support and providing the basis of discussions by the G20 Infrastructure Investment Working Group (IIWG). The analyses <lb/>have been undertaken by: using data reported by bilateral and multilateral development partners to the DAC at the activity level; directly <lb/>obtaining relevant data from institutions through correspondence; estimating official support for development co-operation of non-<lb/>traditional development partners, such as China and India; and carrying out a survey on amounts mobilised from the private sector by <lb/>development partners. <lb/>With this in mind, this report, which builds on previous work on the topic 4 , will contribute to research and policy dialogue on measuring <lb/>finance by development partners to developing country infrastructure. While Section I will provide an overview of total ODF for infrastructure <lb/>by both bilateral and multilateral partners, Section II will specifically concentrate on Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) – in light <lb/>of the renewed attention brought by the creation of new institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New <lb/>Development Bank. In both sections, the report will measure and analyse overall finance of development partners for infrastructure, <lb/>amounts related to private sector operations, and the volume mobilised from the private sector by guarantees, syndicated loans and <lb/>shares in Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs) provided through ODF interventions. <lb/></body>

			<body>I. OVERALL PICTURE BY ALL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS <lb/>Infrastructure Needs in Developing Countries <lb/>Infrastructure is essential for developing countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth as well as poverty reduction, food <lb/>security, and health and education objectives. In light of its importance, infrastructure is one of the top priorities of the Sustainable <lb/>Development Goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. At the same time, according to <lb/>estimates from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), current financing is by far insufficient to meet <lb/>the infrastructure needs (UNCTAD 2014). In fact, while roughly USD 1 trillion is spent on infrastructure in developing countries <lb/>every year, two to three times this amount would be necessary to meet the needs up to 2030, especially in energy and water and <lb/>sanitation (see Figure 1). More than two thirds of these resources are required in Asia, particularly China, which makes up half of <lb/>total investment needs (see Figure 2). <lb/>Source: Estimates based on UNCTAD (2014). <lb/>Note: Only developing countries (2015-2030). <lb/>Source: Gross disbursements.

However, there were large <lb/>differences between countries, as Low Income Countries (LICs) relied much more on the support from development partners than <lb/>Middle Income Countries (MICs), due to their lower capacity to mobilise domestic and external private finance. <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>Official Support to Infrastructure by Development Partners in 2014 <lb/>While relatively small in overall financing, ODF for infrastructure has been growing in recent years. Data from bilateral and multilateral <lb/>development partners reporting to the DAC shows that concessional and non-concessional ODF commitments for infrastructure <lb/>increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% 5 in the period 2005-2014. In addition, the share of infrastructure in total <lb/>sector-allocable ODF 6 by development partners also grew from 20% to 26% in the same period. <lb/>When estimated flows of development partners that do not report to the DAC are also included, total official support to infrastructure <lb/>amounted to USD 60 billion (see Figure 4) in 2014. In terms of breakdown, 56% was concessional finance (i.e ODA) and 44% <lb/>was non-concessional (i.e. OOF) in 2014. This amount does not include the USD 1.7 billion of commercially motivated official <lb/>export credit direct loans provided by OECD Members in the same year 7 . Of the 60 billion provided by development partners, <lb/>43% was disbursed by bilateral development partners and 57% by multilaterals 8 , particularly the Multilateral Development Banks <lb/>(MDBs), which together accounted for half of the total disbursements. If only flows reported to the DAC are considered, ODF for <lb/>infrastructure increased by 6% – or USD 2.7 billion – when compared to 2013. <lb/>Figure 4.

Data on disbursements to the private sector for AFD, <lb/>AfDB, AsDB, EBRD, EIB and IADB Group was collected via email correspondence with the institutions. <lb/>5. This figure is based on concessional and non-concessional commitments of development partners reporting to the DAC at the activity level. In order to use comparable figures, <lb/>development partners that started reporting to the DAC after 2005 have been excluded. These include, inter alia, EBRD, IFC, Korea, Kuwait and the Climate Investment Funds. <lb/>6. This includes other sectors such as health, education, agriculture, etc. Disbursements that are not targeted to a specific sector, e.g. balance-of-payments support, debt relief, <lb/>emergency aid -called &quot; non-sector allocable &quot; -are not considered. <lb/>7. If guarantees and insurance were included, the amount of commercially motivated official export credits for infrastructure projects in developing countries would be about USD <lb/>10 billion in 2014. <lb/>8. Multilateral development partners include the EU, a DAC member with its own sources of financing and budgetary authority, although it has a sui generis legal nature. <lb/></body>

			<body>Official Support for Development Co-operation for Infrastructure by China <lb/>and India <lb/>Aside from DAC countries and MDBs, other providers, such as China, India and the Arab development partners are also significant <lb/>players in infrastructure. The sum of their disbursed amounts is estimated to be USD 4.1 billion in 2014, which accounted for <lb/>14% of the total ODF for infrastructure. Projects financed by China are particularly concentrated in low-income African countries, <lb/>whereas India focuses predominately on neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal (Miyamoto and Chiofalo <lb/>2015). Arab development partners allocated most of their resources to Northern Africa and Middle East countries. It is important to <lb/>note that China and India are not only providers but also recipients of ODF for infrastructure (see Figure 5). <lb/>Figure 5.

In particular, financing for infrastructure is largely characterised by <lb/>significant amounts by a few development partners, with the top five financing almost 55% and top 10 financing 75% of the total <lb/>ODF. Furthermore, the World Bank Group (WBG), which includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), <lb/>the International Development Association (IDA) and the IFC, disbursed almost a quarter of the total amount. <lb/>Compared to 2013, the disbursements for infrastructure by the WBG increased by USD 2 billion in 2014, reaching almost USD 14 <lb/>billion. Disbursements by Germany also increased, approximately by USD half a billion, following an upward trend that started in <lb/>2012. On the other hand, disbursements from the EU Institutions declined by USD 1 billion (a drop of 20%) and by 1.8 billion from <lb/>the United States of America (USA) (a drop of 56%), both in line with a decreasing trend that started in 2012 and 2010, respectively. <lb/></body>

In particular, <lb/>several Arab development partners such as the IsDB, the Arab Fund, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), <lb/>and Kuwait, as well as AfDB, AsDB, and Japan allocated more than half of their sector-allocable ODF to infrastructure.

Overall, the ODF distribution mirrored that of the population <lb/>among developing countries, i.e. higher in Asia and Africa and lower in the Americas and Europe, although Asia received less <lb/>than its share of the total population. In terms of the level of concessionality of ODF, while Africa received more than two thirds <lb/>of infrastructure disbursements in concessional finance (i.e. ODA), the Americas received two thirds in non-concessional finance <lb/>(i.e. OOF). Asia and Europe received half concessional and half non-concessional finance. Europe&apos;s concessional finance for <lb/>infrastructure was mostly disbursements by the EU Institutions to Turkey, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. <lb/>Figure 8.

			<body>Income-Level Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure and Top Recipients <lb/>Disaggregating ODF for infrastructure by income levels, the distribution was more or less similar to the share of developing <lb/>country population by the income groups. Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) received 42%, Upper Middle Income Countries <lb/>(UMICs) 36%, and Low Income Countries (LICs) 22%, while their shares of the population are 42%, 40%, and 17% respectively <lb/>(see Figure 9). In fact, LICs received slightly more than their share of the population. In terms of concessionality of financial flows <lb/>to the different income groups, a high proportion (83%) of ODF for infrastructure to LICs was concessional, while disbursements <lb/>to LMICs were mainly concessional (60%) and to UMICs mainly non-concessional (67%). <lb/>Figure 9. Income Level Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure by All Development Partners, 2014 <lb/>Source: Gross disbursements. See source for Figure 6. It includes estimates by the authors. <lb/>Note: See note at Figure 6. <lb/>In general, there is a high concentration of ODF for infrastructure in a few countries especially large and industrialised emerging <lb/>economies. In 2014, almost 40% of total ODF to infrastructure was disbursed to the top 10 recipients, which are mostly large <lb/>emerging economies of LMICs and UMICs, with India, Viet Nam, and China being the top three (see Figure 10) 12 . Given that the <lb/>supply side is also concentrated, as explained above, the broad picture is that a few large development partners are supporting a <lb/>few large emerging economies. For instance, disbursements by the top 5 development partners to the top 5 recipients consisted <lb/>of a fifth (21%) of total ODF for infrastructure and disbursements by the top 10 development partners to the top 10 recipients <lb/>consisted of 35%. <lb/>Figure 10.

			<body>Sectoral Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure <lb/>In terms of sectoral distribution, transport received the largest share of total ODF disbursements for infrastructure, followed by <lb/>energy, water and sanitation and finally communications (see Figure 11). Within transport, roads received about half, followed <lb/>by rail transport. By looking at energy, half of the support was for electric transmission and technical assistance for policy and <lb/>institutional reforms. Within the remaining half, which is for power generation, 54% was allocated to renewable sources (solar, <lb/>wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass and ocean) and 45% to non-renewables (coal, gas and oil). <lb/>Despite the higher amount going to transport, the sectoral distribution of total investment gaps up to 2030 explained above <lb/>shows that the proportion of needs are the greatest in energy (with 44%) rather than transport (with 22%). At the same time, <lb/>since development partner support to infrastructure can barely meet the estimated total investment gap of USD 1.2 trillion, this <lb/>comparison should be taken with caution. On the other hand, while small at the aggregate level, ODF disbursed by development <lb/>partners is particularly important for aid-dependent poorer countries and sectors where developing country governments and the <lb/>private sector are providing insufficient resources. <lb/>Figure 11.

See source for Figure 6 and UNCTAD (2014). It includes estimates by the authors. <lb/>Note: See note for Figure 6. <lb/>ODF for Infrastructure for the Enabling Environment <lb/>Aside from supporting physical infrastructure, development partners contributed to improving the policy framework and other <lb/>non-physical aspects related to infrastructure. Examples include: strengthening regulatory authorities in the telecommunication, <lb/>transport, and energy sectors; financial and operational restructuring of State Owned Enterprises; and capacity building of <lb/>municipalities in sustainable use and management of water resources. Almost 20% of ODF to infrastructure was allocated to the <lb/>policy framework and other non-physical aspects related to infrastructure sectors in 2014, particularly for energy. Main projects <lb/>here included technical assistance and capacity building for relevant ministries in power sector policy and regulatory reforms, <lb/>especially for renewable energy. <lb/>ODF for Infrastructure Disbursed to Private Sector Companies <lb/>Furthermore, in addition to assisting developing country governments, development partners directly support the private sector by <lb/>using financial instruments such as guarantees, equity and loans with the aim of mobilising additional financing for infrastructure. <lb/>While this support is mainly provided through Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and International Financial Institutions <lb/>(IFIs), traditional development agencies also engage the private sector directly. As shown in Figure 3 above, direct support to the <lb/>private sector represented 10% of total official developmental flows to infrastructure in 2014, although this amount did not include <lb/>guarantees as they are not actual flows. Here, the largest donors were the MDBs—particularly the IFC which was by far the largest, <lb/>disbursing almost USD 2.2 billion (see figure 12). <lb/></body>

Email correspondence with AfDB, AsDB, IADB Group, EBRD, and EIB. IFC (2014). It includes estimates by the authors. <lb/>The sectoral distribution of disbursements to the private sector for infrastructure was 61% to energy, 22% to transport, 14% to <lb/>communications, and 3% to water and sanitation. By comparing these to the distribution of ODF for infrastructure to the public <lb/>sector, leveraging efforts were made more in energy and communications and less so in transport and water and sanitation, <lb/>possibly due to the commercial viability of the two former sectors. Furthermore, the majority (55%) of the direct support to the <lb/>private sector went to UMICs, about a third (32%) to LMICs, and a smaller share (12%) to LICs. While the proportion for UMICs is still <lb/>relatively high, there may be a shift in support to the private sector from upper to lower income countries, as in 2013 the proportion <lb/>allocated to UMICs was two thirds. Top recipient countries were Turkey, Brazil, India and China (see Figure 13). <lb/>Private Finance Mobilised through Guarantees, Syndicated Loans, and Shares <lb/>in CIVs <lb/>Based on a survey carried out by the DAC Secretariat among DFIs, IFIs and other agencies that are trying to leverage resources <lb/>from the private sector, USD 5.9 billion was mobilised in 2014 for infrastructure through the use of guarantees, syndicated loans, <lb/>and shares in collective investment vehicles (CIVs) 13 . Specifically, guarantees and syndicated loans respectively mobilised 41-43% <lb/>of the total, while shares in CIVs mobilised about 16% (Figure 14). In terms of sectors, about two thirds (65%) of private sector <lb/>resources mobilised were in energy (predominantly renewables), followed by transport with roughly a fifth (22%), while smaller <lb/>proportions were mobilised in communication (8%) and water and sanitation (5%). These proportions are not entirely comparable <lb/>with the sectoral distribution of disbursements to the private sector mentioned above because the types of instruments covered <lb/>here are only a subset of those used to measure direct private sector support 14 . Moreover, guarantees are not captured in the <lb/>disbursements to the private sector as they are not flows. <lb/>Figure 12.

SPECIAL FOCUS ON MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS <lb/>To better capture infrastructure finance by MDBs to developing countries, this section focuses on ODF by AfDB, AsDB, CAF, EBRD, <lb/>EIB, IADB Group, IsDB, and the WBG. The data used mainly include disbursements and commitments reported by the MDBs to the <lb/>DAC, as well data provided by them to the authors. In a few cases, estimations have been carried out by using data retrieved from <lb/>annual reports of the MDBs. <lb/>Trend of MDB Financing for Infrastructure in Developing Countries <lb/>In terms of trends, the volume of financing committed by the MDBs to infrastructure more than doubled between 2005 and 2014 <lb/>at a compounded annual growth rate of 10%. In particular, between 2008 and 2009, ODF for infrastructure by MDBs rose by 67%, <lb/>driven mostly by the WBG, in order to counter the financial crisis (see Figure 16). Following 2009, aggregate financing from the <lb/>MDBs slowly and constantly decreased up to 2014, but nevertheless remained at higher levels than the pre-crisis period. The <lb/>EIB—whose financing to developing countries is only a small portion of its total operations 15 —is the only MDB that reduced its <lb/>financing to developing country infrastructure in the period 2005-2014. <lb/>Figure 14.

EBRD and EIB amounts are calculated by using data provided to the authors. <lb/>Largest MDBs Financing Infrastructure in Developing Countries <lb/>In terms of actual disbursements to infrastructure, the MDBs collectively spent USD 31 billion in 2014, which corresponded to half <lb/>of total ODF for infrastructure by bilateral and multilateral development partners 16 . The top MDB by far was the WBG, which alone <lb/>accounted for 43%, i.e. USD 14 billion (see Figure 17). This figure includes amounts from IBRD, IDA and IFC, but excludes those <lb/>of Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as guarantees are not actual flows. The AsDB was the second largest with USD 5.4 <lb/>billion. Unlike bilateral development partners, which provide the vast majority (81%) of their financing at concessional terms, most <lb/>of the financing from the MDBs examined was non-concessional (65%). In particular, the IsDB and EBRD financing was exclusively <lb/>at non-concessional terms. In contrast, the EIB was the only institution that provided practically all its finance at concessional <lb/>terms (97%). <lb/>Figure 17.

			<body>Share of Infrastructure Spending within all Sectors by Development Partners <lb/>To gauge the importance of infrastructure in the portfolios, the share of infrastructure financing within all sector activities (i.e. <lb/>sector-allocable ODF, which excludes general budget support and non-programmable operations 17 ) was calculated. Among the <lb/>MDBs, IsDB, AfDB and AsDB allocated more than half of their sector-allocable ODF to infrastructure in 2014, whereas the rest <lb/>allocated between 26% and 40% (see Figure 18). This suggests that while the WBG was the top MDB in absolute terms, its focus <lb/>on infrastructure was less than some other institutions, such as IsDB, AfDB and AsDB. <lb/>Figure 18.

However, Asia <lb/>received less ODF per capita than the other regions. <lb/>Figure 19.

			<body>Income-Level Distribution and Top Recipients of ODF for Infrastructure by <lb/>MDBs <lb/>In contrast, the income level distribution of ODF by MDBs for infrastructure was almost proportional to the share of developing <lb/>country population by income group (see Figure 20). For example, the LICs received 19% of total amount, somewhat commensurate <lb/>to its population of 17%. At the same time, when examining the country breakdown, disbursements were extremely concentrated <lb/>in a few countries. In fact, the top five recipient countries received almost a third (31%) of the total amount, the top 10 received half <lb/>(49%) and the top 20 more than two thirds (68%). These top recipients were large emerging economies and more industrialised <lb/>developing countries such as, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Viet Nam and Turkey (see Figure 21). Among the top ten recipients, <lb/>Pakistan, Viet Nam and Turkey received a balanced mixture of ODA and OOF whereas the others received mainly or exclusively <lb/>non-concessional finance. <lb/>Figure 20.

			<body>Sectoral Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure by MDBs <lb/>Regarding the sectoral allocation, transport received 43% of total amount, followed by energy at 38%, then water and sanitation <lb/>at 15% and finally communications at 3% (see Figure 22). This distribution shows that MDB allocation of ODF to transport was <lb/>almost double the proportion of total investment gap in these sectors which are based on UNCTAD estimates. Conversely, MDBs <lb/>have allocated smaller shares of their ODF to communications and water and sanitation compared to the investment gaps in <lb/>these sectors. <lb/>Figure 22.

As mentioned earlier in the report, <lb/>this support is related to improving policies and institutions in infrastructure sectors, including activities concerning environmental <lb/>management. EBRD and IADB Group allocated proportionally more than the average, while EIB allocated only 8% (see Figure 23). <lb/>Figure 23.

			<body>ODF for Infrastructure Disbursed to Private Sector Companies by MDBs <lb/>As with bilateral DFIs, MDBs provide financial support and advisory services to private companies and financial institutions <lb/>investing in infrastructure. Private sector operations of MDBs are either concentrated in specialised institutions, such as the IFC <lb/>and IIC, or in separate arms within the same MDB as in the case of AfDB and AsDB. Total financing disbursed directly to the private <lb/>sector by MDBs amounted to USD 4.4 billion in 2014, which corresponded to 2/3 of the total ODF for infrastructure disbursed to <lb/>the private sector by all development partners. Of this USD 4.4 billion, IFC provided half 18 and AsDB disbursed USD 0.7 billion, for <lb/>example (see Figure 24). <lb/>18. As mentioned earlier, these figures do not include guarantees as they are not flows. However, amounts mobilised from the private sector for infrastructure captured below <lb/>include those leveraged by guarantees. <lb/>19. See footnote 13. <lb/>20. In January 2016 the MDBs convened a Task Force to develop a joint framework and methodology to measure private investment catalysed by the MDBs to advance the <lb/>commitment of mobilising/catalysing larger amounts of private investment to support the financing of the Sustainable Development Goals. <lb/>Figure 24. Private Sector instruments for <lb/>Infrastructure (Providers), 2014 <lb/>Figure 25.

See source for Figure 12. It includes estimates by the authors. <lb/>By looking at the sectoral distribution of MDB disbursements to the private sector for infrastructure, energy received the biggest <lb/>share with 57% of total, followed by transport (25%), communications (15%) and water and sanitation (3%). As mentioned above <lb/>in the paragraph related to private sector instruments by all development partners, this distribution points to a stronger effort <lb/>of MDBs on energy and communication in private sector operations compared to the sectoral distribution of their ODF to public <lb/>institutions, probably because of higher investments by private companies in these two sectors. <lb/>In terms of geographical distribution, Asia received 40%, Americas 24%, Europe 22% and Africa 14%. If compared to the distribution <lb/>of ODF to infrastructure for public sector operations, Europe received significantly more. This is due to the significant amounts <lb/>disbursed by IFC, EBRD and EIB to Turkey, which is the top recipient country of infrastructure ODF to the private sector with USD <lb/>743 million (see Figure 25). This is followed by Brazil (USD 347 million), China (USD 318 million) and India (USD 271 million). In <lb/>general, UMICs received 61% of infrastructure ODF to the private sector by the MDBs, while LMICs received 30% and LICs only <lb/>9%. Compared to bilateral DFIs, MDBs channelled their ODF to the private sector somewhat more towards higher income groups. <lb/>Private Finance Mobilised through Guarantees, Syndicated Loans, and Shares <lb/>in CIVs by MDBs <lb/>Based on data from the Survey mentioned above 19 , MDBs mobilised USD 3.1 billion in 2014. As noted before in the report, these <lb/>are only a subset of the instruments used by MDBs. Therefore, amounts mobilised by these institutions through all private sector <lb/>instruments are much higher 20 . The majority of the USD 3.3 billion was mobilised by syndicated loans (60%), while one third was <lb/>by guarantees (see Figure 26), and 9% by shares in CIVs. In terms of sectoral allocation of mobilised amounts from the private <lb/>sector, half was in energy (51%), while 35% was in transport. Water and sanitation and communication mobilised 8% and 6%, <lb/>respectively. Top recipient countries were Viet Nam, Cameroon, China, Jordan, Mexico and Indonesia (see Figure 27). <lb/></body>

			<body>While these aspirations indicate that MDBs will continue to be key players in supporting infrastructure in the near future, quantifying <lb/>the exact contribution of each institution would need to be harmonised: <lb/>• First, the scope of infrastructure needs to be clearly defined, as some MDBs include social infrastructure in their targets <lb/>while others do not. Furthermore, even within economic infrastructure, some include sub-sectors, such as natural resource <lb/>extraction and municipal services, while others do not.<lb/>• Second, while most of the MDBs mainly support ODA-eligible countries, some provide significant amounts to more advanced <lb/>economies in Europe (i.e. EBRD, EIB). In this regard, it would be important to be able to distinguish the range of countries <lb/>that the aspirations cover, particularly since infrastructure financing needs in developing countries exceeds those of the <lb/>more advanced economies (McKinsey 2016).<lb/>• Third, the unit of measurement of the aspirations should be consistently set as there is divergence in the way quantitative <lb/>ambitions are set, with some MDBs indicating absolute amounts, others percentages of annual increase in lending, and <lb/>others still pointing to the future share of infrastructure financing among total lending. This is problematic as without a <lb/>common yardstick among MDBs it is not possible to understand the exact amount that the institution is aspiring for and <lb/>compare these amounts across the institutions.<lb/>• Finally, the aspirations expressed through the Declaration may need to be approved by the respective boards of the MDBs <lb/>for it to be binding.<lb/>In addition to harmonisation of data on the coverage of sectors and countries as well as the parameters of the commitments, the <lb/>establishment of a mechanism to monitor the extent to which the declarations are actually achieved would be useful. The OECD/ <lb/>DAC, as a non-operational and neutral body that collects statistics, could be well placed to contribute to this monitoring function. <lb/>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS <lb/>While relatively small in comparison to the financing needs of developing countries, ODF for infrastructure has been growing <lb/>significantly in the last decade in both absolute terms and as a share of development partners&apos; portfolios. In 2014, total ODF to <lb/>infrastructure amounted to USD 61 billion, 56% of which was concessional financing. In terms of providers, MDBs disbursed about <lb/>half of all ODF for infrastructure, while other large providers were G7 countries, EU Institutions and Korea. <lb/>In general, there was a high concentration of ODF for infrastructure in a few countries, especially large and industrialised emerging <lb/>economies, such as India, Vietnam, China and Brazil. Given that the supply side was also characterised by significant financing by a <lb/>few major development partners, the broad picture is that a few large development partners were supporting a few large emerging <lb/>economies. In terms of sectors, disbursements were mainly in transport and energy. <lb/>Direct support to the private sector represented 10% of total ODF to infrastructure in 2014, mainly in energy and for UMICs. <lb/>Furthermore, amounts mobilised by development partners from the private sector through guarantees, syndicated loans and <lb/>shares in CIVs were also concentrated in energy. This shows that the development partners and private sector collaborated most <lb/>in the energy sector, probably due to the commercial viability of energy projects. <lb/>This report also focused on ODF to developing country infrastructure by the MDBs. In terms of trends, the volume of financing <lb/>committed to infrastructure by the MDBs doubled between 2005 and 2014. Unlike bilateral development partners, which provided <lb/>the vast majority of their financing at concessional terms, most of the financing from the MDBs was non-concessional. In terms <lb/>of direct financing to the private sector, MDBs disbursed 2/3 of total ODF for infrastructure to the private sector in 2014, half of <lb/>which was provided by IFC. <lb/></body>
