has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of tax sharing and transfers, 
and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. Local governments have hardly any discretionary power to 
modify taxation, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and penalties. They can also spend the 
profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to central government restrictions. As the 1994 tax reform recentralised 
revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have 
grown. In order to accommodate this, the central government has raised the scale of transfers. Over the past decade, 
China's transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become markedly more redistributive. 
Nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much greater than between regions in OECD 
countries. The extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies, thus affecting the delivery of services. The 
government's plan to equalise service provision across the country therefore calls for fine-tuning the transfer system 
and improving local revenue. Some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that 
would substantially raise tax revenue. A significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of 
land-use rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have strong 
budgets.

Le système de partage des recettes et des transferts budgétaires en Chine Les principales caractéristiques des accords de financement infranationaux actuels en Chine remontent à la 
réforme fiscale de 1994. La Chine possède une structure administrative à plusieurs niveaux qui partage les recettes 
fiscales nationales par le biais d'un système de répartition des recettes fiscales et de transferts, et qui attribue les 
missions et responsabilités en matière de dépense. Les collectivités locales n'ont guère de pouvoir discrétionnaire afin 
de modifier la fiscalité, même si elles collectent des recettes non fiscales provenant de divers droits, prélèvements et 
amendes. Elles peuvent aussi dépenser les recettes provenant de la vente de droits d'usage des terrains sous réserve de 
restrictions imposées par le gouvernement central. Comme la réforme fiscale de 1994 a centralisé de nouveau les 
recettes et le pouvoir de décision, les déséquilibres verticaux entre recettes et dépenses au niveau infranational se sont 
accentués. Afin d'en tenir compte, le gouvernement central a augmenté le volume des transferts. Au cours de la 
décennie passée, la politique des transferts en Chine a répondu aux déséquilibres horizontaux et est devenue 
nettement plus redistributive. Néanmoins, les disparités fiscales au sein des provinces demeurent élevées et sont 
beaucoup plus grandes qu'entre régions des pays de l'OCDE. Le degré de péréquation au sein des provinces varie, ce 
qui affecte la prestation de services. Afin d'égaliser cette dernière dans tout le pays, le plan du gouvernement appelle 
donc à peaufiner le système de transferts et à améliorer les recettes locales. Certaines autorités locales sont en train de 
tester un impôt foncier résidentiel, mais pas sous une forme qui permettrait d'augmenter considérablement les 
recettes fiscales. Un impôt foncier important aurait tendance à réduire les recettes provenant de la vente de droits 
d'usage des terrains et, plus généralement, améliorerait la situation financière des administrations locales déjà dotées 
de solides budgets.

discusses past and potential changes that affect fiscal disparities across the country. China has a multi-
tiered government structure (Box 1) that shares overall national tax revenues through tax sharing and 
transfers. The paper first outlines the distribution of revenue and expenditure by level of government. It 
then discusses how transfers affect fiscal inequality. After considering the orientation of government policy 
in service equalisation, the paper looks at the government's plans to improve sub-national finance. Box 1. China's administrative divisions The administrative structure of the People's Republic of China has four sub-national levels: provincial, 
prefectural, county and township. The People's Assembly at each level reports to the assembly at the next higher level. 
Finally, the provincial assembly reports to the national assembly. There is also an informal level of government below 
the township level called the village level. In parallel to the government structure, there is a similar structure for the 
Communist Party. The names of each level of government vary across the country. The provincial level can be known as a province, an autonomous region or a municipality (these are generally 
large cities under the direct control of the national assembly – the case for Beijing, Shanghai or Tianjin, or part of a 
former larger province as in the case of Chongqing). In the rest of this paper, all provincial-level governments are 
referred to as provinces. At the prefectural level, there are three types of government: prefectures, prefectural-level cities and sub-
provincial-level cities. The distinction between the first two depends on the level of urbanisation, while the latter 
consists of a small group of cities that are able to bypass the provincial government and deal directly with national 
government in certain areas. Municipalities do not have the prefectural level of government. At the county level, there are three types of institution: districts, county cities and counties which again can have 
varying names across the country. Districts are urban areas of a prefectural-level city. Counties are generally rural 
areas, though some have an urban character. County cities are counties that had an urban core of above a certain size 
before 2000. Finally, the township is lowest level of administration. In the urban areas of prefectural-level cities, this unit is 
known as a sub-district. Elsewhere, it is known as a town or township depending on its size. There also exists a unit 
below the township level known as a village in rural areas or neighbourhood in urban areas. They have no official 
administrative role but serve as a channel of communication to the population. Provincial level

Xiao Wang was an economist (Consultant) working on the China Desk in the Economics Department of 
the OECD in 2012 and early 2013, and Richard Herd is the head of the Desk. This paper was prepared as 
background analysis for the 2013 OECD Economic Survey of China. The authors are grateful for useful 
feedback from Yong Zheng and Jidong Yuan at the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and from Vincent Koen,

of cascading indirect taxes. Income tax thresholds were lowered, leading a much larger proportion of 
employees to pay income tax. This new system replaced  " tax farming " , under which provincial 
governments negotiated a payment to central government and could retain all remaining tax revenues. The Chinese national government budget (which excludes social security funds) relies predominately 
on indirect and company taxation for revenue. Within these two groups VAT dominates. It will become 
even more dominant once the business tax (a sales tax on services) is rolled into the VAT. Moreover these 
two sets of taxes have tended to grow much faster than national income. Company taxes, though, are more 
sensitive to cyclical fluctuations than the VAT. By 2011, these three taxes accounted for close to 85% of 
all national tax revenue (Figure 1). Individual income tax, which has been in place for three decades, 
provides limited revenue. The yield from personal income taxation is one-third the yield of corporate tax 
and 10% of the yield of indirect taxation. When introduced in 1983, the threshold for payment of income 
tax was set at 12 times average earnings. In 1999, it was lowered to slightly below average earnings. The 
threshold was raised at the end of 2011 to 90% of average earnings. Figure 1. Sources of tax revenue at the national level In 2011 Source: China Statistical Yearbook Tax assignment In China, local governments have no discretionary power to raise taxation, though they can lower 
taxation by granting tax holidays for new investors. The central government sets the legislation governing 
taxation and the rate of each tax. Local authorities have no autonomy in the area of taxation in only four 
OECD countries (Figure 2). In China the central government assigns various portions of taxes directly to 
local governments. The precise share varies from tax to tax. Just under half of tax revenues are assigned 
exclusively to either the central or the local governments: pure central government taxes relate to foreign 
trade or excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, petroleum products, cars and jewellery (known collectively as the 
consumption tax); pure local government taxes cover services and property. The remaining portion of tax 
revenue is shared between central and local governments and accounts for slightly more than half of total 
tax revenue. Overall the share accrued to the central government is around 70% (Table 1). Value added tax,

China Local tax revenue as a percentage of GDP ECO/WKP(2013)22 8 The largest tax assigned to provincial governments is that on services, known as the business tax 
(Figure 3). This tax complements VAT which is only levied on goods. However, its existence is an 
anomaly as all goods-specific (and hence cascading) taxes were abolished in 1994 and replaced by VAT on 
goods. The government is committed to merging the business tax with VAT. The first pilot was undertaken 
in Shanghai in 2011 and was widened in September 2012 to Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Xiamen, as 
well as the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian and Hubei (Brys and Matthews, 
2013). In 2013, the business tax will be replaced by VAT in the following economic zones: Bohai, Yangtze 
River Delta and Yangtze River, Pearl River Delta and the Straits economic zones. The remaining taxes assigned to local governments are based mostly on the value or quantity of local 
assets. Taxes on property have been particularly buoyant in the decade to 2011, rising by a compound 
growth rate of 33% to approach 2% of GDP. In addition, property developers have to pay the business tax 
of the value of their sales. This tax is estimated to raise a further 0.5% of GDP in revenue. It is, though, 
more of tax on goods and services than a tax on property – even if investment goods are usually exempt 
from such taxes. Since 2011, householders who sell an apartment within two years of purchase have to pay 
the business tax. Overall, taxes levied on the use of property amount to 0.7% of GDP while taxes on the 
sale of property raise around 1.2% of GDP (excluding the business tax). Figure 3. The importance of the various taxes assigned to local government Percentage of total locally assigned tax revenue in 2011 Source: China Statistical Yearbook. Each level of sub-national government shares their tax income with the levels of government below. 
Provinces use various mechanisms: i) the sharing of specific taxes; ii) the assignment of specific taxes; iii) 
the sharing of the increase in the yield from a base year; and iv) the assignment of an amount that depends 
on a predetermined growth rate. On average, the largest share of all local taxes is taken by the prefectural 
governments (Table 2). This is true of all individual local taxes except the property and resource taxes, 
which mainly accrue to county and township governments. There are considerable differences both across 
and within provinces in the distribution of taxes to lower-level authorities. Business tax Value added tax and

2597 Source: Ministry of Finance (2011b), Local Fiscal Statistical Yearbook, 2009. Other sources of revenue Sub-national governments have non-tax revenue from fees, levies, penalties and the profit from the 
sale of land-use rights. Overall, non-tax sources of revenue represent slightly under half of their total 
revenues, amounting to 2.2% of GDP (Table 3). Sub-national governments have significant income from 
the ownership of state-owned enterprises, in contrast to the central government. The total amount of non-
tax income (excluding asset sales) amounts to nearly 30% of their total revenue. In the past, fees were major part of non-tax revenue. They were administered through off-budget 
funds mainly to fund education and transport. Since 2012, all fees have been administered through the 
budget but reliance on fees remains. Indeed, these fees are one of the three elements of local governments' 
fiscal autonomy. The other two are income from land sales that accrues to extra-budgetary funds and the 
financing of infrastructure though infrastructure development companies (which are a reflection of the 
balanced budget requirements for local authorities that is embedded in the Budget Law). On top of the non-tax revenue, sub-national governments raise significant amounts from the sale of 
land-use rights for periods of between 30 and 70 years. These stem from the government's ownership of all 
urban land and its monopoly of the right to transform land from agricultural to construction use. In 2009, 
the gross revenue from these sales amounted to some 4.2% of GDP, rising to over 7% in 2010 and 2011, 
before falling to just over 5% of GDP in 2012. However, not all of the land sale revenues represent profit 
for the government, as compensation needs to be paid. In addition the land is sold fully serviced. The cost 
of installing the road, water, drainage, electricity and telecom networks has to be deducted from the gross 
sales revenue. In 2009, these two cost elements absorbed half of gross sales revenue. The net revenue from 
land sales is concentrated on the county and prefecture governments where the profit from land sales is 
equivalent to some 14% of their total revenue. By contrast, when the property market was in its infancy in 
1999, net land sales revenues accounted for only 4.5% of revenue. These governments are constrained as to 
the use that is made of such revenues: they can only be used to create new physical assets for the 
government. ECO/WKP(2013)22 10 Table 3. Taxes and other sources of revenue by levels of government In 2009 Central

1.2 Source: Ministry of Finance (2011b), Local Fiscal Statistical Yearbook, 2009. Expenditure The Constitution sets out the extent of the autonomy of sub-national governments and determines the 
division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs. The division of powers is 
guided by the principle of giving full scope to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under 
the unified leadership of the central authorities. The people's congresses of provinces, and their respective standing committees, may adopt local 
regulations. These must not contravene the Constitution, the law or the national administrative rules and 
regulations. Local congresses must report such local regulations to the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress for the record. The split of responsibilities is set out in the Constitution. Local governments at and above the county 
level conduct administrative work concerning the economy, education, science, culture, public health, 
physical culture, urban and rural development, finance, civil affairs, public security, ethnic affairs, judicial 
administration and family planning in their respective administrative areas. They also appoint or remove 
administrative functionaries. Local governments at and above the county level also direct the work of their subordinate departments 
and of lower level governments, and have the power to alter or annul inappropriate decisions of their 
subordinate departments and of lower-level governments. At the same time, they have some autonomy 
within the limits of their authority and implement the laws and policies of the state in light of the existing 
local situation. This hierarchical structure limits the extent to which decentralisation leads to policies that 
differ markedly across the country. Indeed, a close look at local government expenditure decisions reveals a highly centralised system in 
which local governments are effectively agents acting on behalf of the central government (OECD, 2006a). 
The contrast between the nominal decentralisation of responsibilities and the high degree of centralisation 
of actual authority is further accentuated by the lack of elections or other formal mechanisms for holding 
local officials accountable to the citizens under their jurisdiction. Moreover, the performance of 
government officials at lower levels is judged according to criteria set out by higher levels of government. 
Thus, although comparisons of the share of spending by sub-national governments in total public spending 
appear to show that China has amongst the most decentralised public sectors in the world, this is 
misleading. ECO/WKP(2013)22 11 Without being autonomous, sub-national bodies make outlays accounting for around four-fifths of all 
government expenditure (Table 4). The central government only spends one-fifth of total outlays. The 
county level of government accounts for more than one-third of total spending and has the major share of 
outlays, followed by the prefecture governments. Moreover, local government finances many public 
infrastructure investment projects off-budget through local government financing platforms. Adding such 
quasi-government spending, results in a further increases the share of sub-national spending. Table 4. Share of each government level by expenditure type In 2009 Central

Source: Ministry of Finance (2011b), Local Fiscal Statistical Yearbook 2009. Although they account for only one-fifth of total sub-national public spending, provincial 
governments are active in most types of outlays (Table 5). A large part of provincial expenditure is 
focussed on economic affairs (such outlays on various industries, science and technology and 
transportation) which require a strategic focus (Kamal-Chaoui et al., 2009). Nonetheless, provincial 
governments allocate almost 60% of their spending to outlays that are mainly undertaken by lower levels 
of government (education, health and the social safety net). Social security spending is also decentralised. 
These types of expenditure assignments are generally central government functions, as social security 
programmes generally entail risk pooling and redistribution in order to guard against economic shocks that 
only affect one area and to ensure that poor neighbourhoods are not overburdened by social payments 
(OECD, 2010). ECO/WKP(2013)22 12 Table 5. Public expenditure by level of government In 2009 Central

Source: Ministry of Finance (2011b), Local Fiscal Statistical Yearbook 2009. Over the past decade, the share of spending undertaken by local authorities has increased markedly 
(Figure 4). This reflected a major change in the orientation of public spending towards spending on public 
services rather than economic services – in line with the conclusions of an OECD report on Chinese public 
finances (OECD, 2006a). This re-orientation followed a seven-year period when the government restored 
spending after its collapse during the first half of the 1990s. The increase in sub-national public spending 
was particularly pronounced at the prefectural and county levels as these are the levels of government that 
deliver services to people. Higher-level government has the power to determine the expenditure responsibilities of the level 
immediately below it: provinces determine the assignments of prefectures, prefectures the assignments of 
districts, counties and county cities, and the latter two the assignments of townships (Shen et al., 2012). 
Consequently some have argued that higher-level governments have been increasingly devolving 
assignments to lower local levels of government (Kamal-Chaoui et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). The devolved 
categories include not only pre-determined sub-national responsibilities, such as urban maintenance and 
construction, but also the incremental part of service provision for education and healthcare spending. In 
reality, though, this downward movement of expenditure reflected a change in spending priorities towards 
those services provided at the sub-national level (especially at the county level) that was approved in 
budgets by the National People's Congress. ECO/WKP(2013)22 13 Figure 4. Central and local government expenditure as share of GDP Excluding social security spending Source: China Statistical Yearbook. Vertical balance between expenditure and revenue The gaps between fiscal resources (tax and non-tax, but excluding transfers) and expenditure depend 
on the position of the authority in the vertical hierarchy of government (Table 6). For sub-national 
government as a whole, expenditure has grown much faster than fiscal resources. The gap between fiscal 
resources and expenditure is particularly marked for rural counties, where fiscal revenue amounts to only 
slightly more than one quarter of their expenditure. The gap is much lower for the more urban county cities 
and falls yet again in the urban districts of prefectural level cities. Table 6. Balance between expenditure and the sum of tax and non-tax revenues In 2009 Revenue Expenditure

Local ECO/WKP(2013)22 14 Horizontal balance between regions Economic and fiscal inequality between regions is much higher in China than in most OECD 
countries (Table 7). The tax sharing arrangements do not incorporate any redistributive formula and so the 
inequality of tax revenue per capita is very similar to the inequality of GDP per capita. Indeed, in China 
there is no correlation between the average tax rate for each province and its level of development. There is 
considerable variation in the average tax rate due to factors linked to the structure of the economy of each 
province. An analysis of variance suggests that around 80% of the variation in tax revenues per capita is 
due the variation of per capita GDP, rather than tax rates. Table 7. Regional inequality in China and selected OECD countries Economic

14.4 Note: For federal/regional countries the indicators are calculated for the state/regional level and include every single jurisdiction. For 
unitary countries, local governments are grouped into deciles (or  " tenths " ) ranked in increasing order of fiscal capacity before 
equalisation. Both sections of the table show the Gini coefficients of per capita tax revenue across sub-central governments, and the 
maximum and minimum fiscal capacity before and after receiving transfers. Year 2004 figures are used for OECD countries, except 
Germany (2005). For China, the Gini coefficient is calculated based on prefectural level fiscal data, weighted by population size. Source: Blöchliger and Charbit, 2008; Ministry of Finance (2012a), Fiscal Statistical Yearbook of China 2011 and 2001; OECD 
Regional statistics. The way in which the economic structure of a province interacts with the tax assignments is one 
reason for the variation in tax rates. For corporate taxes, when companies operate across several provinces, 
it is extremely difficult to allocate profit between provinces. An allocation using value added, employment 
or assets would transform the tax into a tax on the factor used as a key for allocation rather than a tax on 
profits. Consequently, the entire profit of a company is allocated to the province where the company has its 
headquarters. As a result Beijing and Shanghai have particularly high revenues from this source. Equally, 
the tax sharing agreement allocates all taxes on services to provinces. However, service activities are not 
distributed equally across the nation and here Beijing and Shanghai benefit again. Hainan though gains ECO/WKP(2013)22 15 from its large tourist industry (Figure 5). On the other hand, for value-added tax and other local taxes, there 
is much less variation across provinces (Table 8). Figure 5. Overall revenues by type and province Source: Ministry of Finance (2011b), Local Fiscal Statistical Yearbook, 2009. Table 8. Dispersion of different tax and non-tax revenues across provinces In 2009 Taxes except

Source: Ministry of Finance (2011b), Local Fiscal Statistical Yearbook, 2009. Fiscal disparities within provinces Fiscal disparities are starker within than across provinces. Horizontal fiscal disparity measured by 
Gini coefficient at the sub-provincial level is 0.53, well above the provincial level figure of 0.31 (Tables 7 
and 9). The Theil index shows that 75% of the overall national disparity can be attributed to within-
province factors. In particular, fiscal disparity among counties or county cities is substantially higher than 
across prefecture-level cities (PLCs) and urban districts. The levels of the inequality indices suggest that 
the principal problem of differences in tax revenue per capita occur in county areas. This inequality is 
related to the very different economic experience of counties across a province. As shown in Herd et al. 
(forthcoming), there are many counties and county cities that are, in reality as urban as urban districts 
according to the metrics of either population density or gross local product per capita. 0

Note: The Theil index provides a way to measure the discrepancy between the structure of the distribution of income (or another 
variable) across groups and the structure of the distribution of individuals across those same groups. The Theil inequality index 
summarises the distribution of a variable by calculating sum of the logarithms of the quotient of value for a group and the average for 
all groups weighted by the share of the group. For example, when all population groups have the same income share as their 
population share then the Theil index is zero. In this case, the calculation assumes that prefectures spend all their revenue in their 
urban districts rather than in counties. Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties. Within-province disparities in expenditure are also large, signalling limited service provision capacity 
in some counties. Overall, the richest sub-provincial unit spends about 29 times as much per capita as the 
poorest unit. The ratios between extremes are 13 times within PLCs, 15 times within county cities, and 26 
times within counties (Ministry of Finance, 2011a). In particular, unlike PLCs and county cities, counties 
with limited fiscal resources have less leeway to provide matching funds for additional spending mandates 
requested from superior authorities. This could result in substandard service delivery, for instance in 
renovating school facilities in poor rural areas (Shen et al., 2012). Inter-governmental transfers Tax sharing In China, almost half of national tax revenue is allocated to local governments through tax-sharing 
agreements. Tax sharing can take several forms. Following Blöchliger and Petzold (2010), strict tax 
sharing between government levels implies meeting four criteria simultaneously: @BULLET Individual proportionality: The revenue share of each sub-central government is strictly related to 
tax revenue generated on its own territory. 
@BULLET Risk sharing: the amount of revenue allocated to the sub-central level is strictly related to the 
total tax intake. 
@BULLET Un-conditionality: The sub-central government is free to use the allocated revenue. 
@BULLET Formula stability: The revenue share between the central and the sub-central government is 
predetermined in advance and not changed during the period of the agreement. China is unusual in that its tax-sharing system follows the strict model outlined above, in contrast to nearly 
all OECD countries (Figure 6). Despite having no authority to borrow, sub-national governments are fully 
exposed to the risk of fluctuations in tax revenues from either a factor specific to one province or general 
business cycle fluctuations. The exposure to volatility is particular large for their share of corporate income 
tax. They are also free to allocate the cash in line with their spending priorities subject to the overall 
priorities set by the National People's Congress. There is individual proportionality in allocating taxes, 
which encourages local governments to boost economic activity in their jurisdiction. ECO/WKP(2013)22 17 Figure 6. Strict tax sharing and other forms of sub-national government revenue Source: Blöchliger and Petzold (2010). There is a well-defined formula for allocating different taxes, which has been slightly changed three 
times since 1994. It has not been altered since 2003, when the central share in income taxes was raised 
from 50 to 60%, the share of stamp duty on financial transactions rose from 50 to 97%, and the business 
tax on the financial industry was assigned to the central government. Since the 1990s, the proportion of 
total expenditure undertaken by sub-national government has risen considerably. The discrepancy between 
a fixed revenue share and rising expenditure share has driven much of the growth in vertical fiscal 
inequalities: by the time the system devised in 1994 was fully operational in 1999, the aggregate tax share 
of sub-national government was 46% while their expenditure share was 69%; and by 2011, the tax share 
had remained constant at 46% of total tax revenues, while the expenditure share had risen to 85%. A 
mechanical calculation suggests that if the average tax share were raised to 62%, the gap between 
expenditure and revenue would be lowered to the level observed in 1999. This would eliminate the gap 
between revenue and expenditure for the aggregate of provincial, prefecture, urban districts and county 
cities. The remaining fiscal gaps would be found almost exclusively at county level and would presumably 
be concentrated in the poorest counties. Transfers One of the stated objectives of the 1994 tax reform was to recentralise decision-making and enable the 
central government to better control policy implementation across the country. In order to accommodate a 
strong increase in the share of expenditure in the areas covered by sub-national government not matched 
by increased tax revenues, the government designed a new transfer system, which has three components: @BULLET General transfers used to lower disparities in expenditure. 
@BULLET Earmarked transfers used to subsidise local projects in certain areas subject to matching outlays 
by local government. 
@BULLET Compensation transfers designed to reduce the revenue loss accruing to some local governments 
after the 1994 tax reform. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Switzerland United States (2001)

Intergovernmental grants ECO/WKP(2013)22 18 Each of the three groups has a number of sub-components (Figure 7). Some of the grants under the general 
transfer component resemble earmarked grants. However, they do not require matching funds. Moreover 
they accrue to provinces according to their GDP per capita. The wage adjustment grant varies by a factor 
of four between eastern and western provinces. The compulsory education grant is only paid to rural 
counties and compensated for the abolition of the agricultural tax, previously used to fund education. Figure 7. Major components of central-provincial transfers As of 2011 Source: Ministry of Finance, Finance Yearbook 2012. Immediately after the 1994 tax reform, the predominant form of transfer was that which compensated 
regions that had lost as a result of the tax reform. The formula was designed to ensure that the grant 
component fell gradually relative to GDP. As local tax receipts failed to keep up with expenditure, the 
share of general and earmarked transfers rose (Figure 8). By 2011, these forms of transfer dominated. 
There are some 20 categories of over 100 different recurrent transfers classified as earmarked transfers 
while there are 18 types of relatively fixed types of grants defined as general transfers. The main form of 
general transfer is the equalisation transfer, accounting for 19% of total transfers in 2011. It aims to lower 
spending inequality across the country (Box 2). Transfers from central to 
provincial government General transfers,

The design of the equalisation transfer The formula used to calculate this transfer is based on the gap between standard revenue capacity and standard 
current expenditures. The former is estimated using the tax bases and standard tax rates, while the latter are 
calculated based on different per capital spending for different categories of outlays for adjusted cost factors such as 
altitude, population density, temperature, transport distance and the proportion of the population belonging to minority 
groups. The categories of spending include administration services, public safety, education, urban maintenance, 
healthcare, environmental protection and social assistance. The transfer amount is also adjusted for coefficients that take into account the size of the standard gap, the 
actual gap, and the total amount allocated from central government revenue. Moreover, rewards in terms of additional 
grants are given to provinces that achieve better fiscal equalisation results at sub-provincial levels (top five 
performers). Algebraically, the amount of the equalisation transfer for a province is given by: 񮽙񮽙 񮽙 = = 
񮽙񮽙 񮽙 − − 񮽙 
− 
񮽙 񮽙 + Δ 񮽙 + + 񮽙 where: ETi = the equalisation transfer for province i TET = total equalisation grant available in the budget year. The size is determined by the increase in the shared 
income tax allotted to the central government, plus an extra amount allocated on an ad-hoc basis, subject to annual 
funding availability. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 %

General 
Earmarked ECO/WKP(2013)22 20 SEi = standard expenditure of province i. It is the sum of total standardised spending for 14 sectors. For each 
sector, the standard national average standard expenditure per registered inhabitant is calculated. The national 
average is then converted to a provincial average by adjusting for cost differences caused by the difference from the 
national average of altitude, population density, temperature, transport distances, the number of civil servants, regional 
wage differentials, number of students and the prevalence of minority groups. The cost factors vary according to the 
spending category. Total standardised spending was calculated as the product of standardised spending per 
registered inhabitant and the number of registered inhabitants (irrespective of where they actually live) during the 
period 1995 to 2011. Since 2012, the population measure used is the registered population plus 15% of the difference 
between the actual population and the registered population. SRi = standard revenue of province i. For each type of tax, standard tax revenue is determined by multiplying the 
standard tax base with the standard tax rate. SE = total standard expenditure of the country. SR = total standard revenue of the country. σi = fiscal difficulty index of province i, calculated as the sum of spending on wages for civil servants, operating 
expenses and payments for the basic livelihood allowance as a percentage to standard revenue. ∆i = adjustment index of province i based on the difference between the change in the actual grant and the 
baseline predicted amount. REi = reward grant allotted to province i, if any (only to top five performers of fiscal equalisation results at sub-
provincial levels). Originally only 18 provinces were eligible for equalisation transfers. This was widened to 25 in 2002 and has remained 
constant since. Six provinces remain ineligible for such transfer: Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and 
Zhejiang. The grant system favours poorer areas The strong weight given to the transfers designed to help poorer areas has successfully boosted 
incomes in these areas. One metric to assess the success is the extent to which transfers to different areas 
when measured relative to that area's GDP fall as GDP per capita increases. Across provinces, this is 
indeed the case (Figure 9). Broadly speaking a 10% decline in relative income (from 50% to 45% of 
average income) is associated with an increase of transfers of 1.2 percentage points of GDP. Other factors 
are also important in determining the extent of the transfer. ECO/WKP(2013)22 21 Figure 9. Transfers to provinces and the level of development 2009, Percentage of regional GDP, excluding Qinghai and Tibet Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties The increasing importance of transfers for poorer areas is seen not just at the province level but also at 
the county level. The bulk of counties receive transfers of less than 50% of their local GDP. Over the range 
of transfers of zero to halve of local GDP (the bulk of all counties), there is a visible relationship between 
the extent of the grant relative to local GDP and income levels (Figure 10, Panel A). However, once grants 
account for more than halve of local GDP, reaching in a few cases over 200% of local GDP, other factors 
become more important in determining grants. For these counties grants are not closely relative to local 
GDP per capita (Figure 10, Panel B). In practice, compensation grants have tended to reduce the extent of fiscal discrepancies over time. 
While the major losers from the 1994 tax reform were higher income areas, which therefore initially 
received more compensation, a 1% increase in per capita income is associated with only a ½ per cent 
increase in compensation tax payments. Thus the compensation payment per unit of local GDP declines 
with rising income. In any event, poorer regions are now more dependent on compensation grants than 
richer ones are. At the level of the prefecture, for instance, the 50 prefectures with the lowest per capita 
GDP are twice as dependent on this form of transfer as the 50 prefectures with the highest income. The total of all other transfers has a much stronger redistributive effect than the compensation transfer. 
At both the prefecture and the county level, there is a negative relation between this type of transfer and 
GDP per capita. The relationship is much stronger at the prefecture level than at the county level. In both 
cases, however, the overall explanatory value of income per capita in determining the level of transfers is 
low, indicating that there are many other variables that come into play when determining the scale of sub-
national transfers. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 9.5

Transfers as percent of county GDP and GDP per capita 2009 Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties At present, most weight is given to the registered population when determining the overall grant to a 
province. If the outcome of the allocation is measured in terms of the transfer per registered inhabitant in 
provinces, then there is no correlation between the income level of the province and the per capita grant 
received by the province (Figure 11, panel A). To a first approximation, then, the average grant is the same 
for each province on a per capita basis, with fluctuations according to the specific characteristics of the 
province. However, just as a flat-rate per capita tax is regressive, a flat rate per capita transfer is 
progressive, giving a higher increase in government revenue in poor provinces than in rich provinces. This 
result, however, is due entirely to the high level of transfers per registered inhabitant that are received by 
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Over the other 28 provinces and municipalities, there is a strong negative 
relationship between per capita GDP and the total transfer per registered inhabitant (Figure 11, panel B). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 8

Source: Ministry of Finance, Fiscal Statistical Yearbook of China 2011 and 2001. The method of calculating the equalisation grant was changed in 2012 to take the number of migrants 
into account. The population used to calculate the per capita data was defined as the registered population 
plus 15% of the difference between the actual and the registered population. This change will tend to 
reduce the extent to which inter-provincial redistribution via transfers is correlated with income. However, 
the equity of spending within provinces could be improved if provinces followed the same rules in making 
their grants and higher transfers resulted in more spending on services for migrants. The use of earmarked transfers Intergovernmental transfers can serve several objectives (Oates, 1999; Ahmad and Searle, 2005; 
Blöchliger and Vammalle, 2009; OECD/KIPF, 2012). Three goals stand out: @BULLET Fiscal equalisation across jurisdictions for public service provision. 
@BULLET Correction of negative and positive spillovers to induce the right amount of services. 
@BULLET Provision of certain types and standards of services as determined by the central government. Achieving these goals requires the combined use of  " unconditional grants "  (general transfers), and 
 " conditional grants "  (earmarked transfers). The trade-off is complicated, with unconditional grants 
providing more local autonomy but requiring local capacity and accountability, and conditional grants 
giving the central government more control to meet its objectives (OECD, 2012 and Blöchliger and 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.0

the (very wide) ranges observed in the OECD (Figures 12 and 13). This share has remained broadly stable 
over the past decade. Figure 12. Composition of grants for states/provinces in OECD countries Note: 2006 data are used for OECD countries and 2011 data for China.

negotiated basis (Ministry of Finance, 2012b). Moreover, many of the grants are determined by individual 
ministries and are not controlled by the Ministry of Finance. This undermines transparency relative to a 
rule-based system. In particular, the system favours localities that lobby harder rather than those in greater 
need. Furthermore, the centre lacks the monitoring mechanisms to ensure the effective use of these 
earmarked resources, especially at sub-provincial levels (Ahmad et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2012). The impact of the transfer system on fiscal inequality China's transfer policy has become markedly more redistributive over the past decade. By 2010, the 
reduction in the inter-provincial inequality through transfers was larger in China than in the OECD area 
(Table 10). The correlation between transfers per capita and GDP per capita, which was positive in 2000, 
had turned markedly negative by 2010. Despite the reduction in spending inequality, the fiscal disparity per 
capita is high in China as compared with OECD countries. However, there is markedly less inequality in 
fiscal spending than in GDP per capita. Table 10. Fiscal disparity reducing effect of transfers in OECD countries and in China After equalisation (in per cent)

For federal/regional countries the indicators are calculated for the state/regional level and include every single jurisdiction. For 
unitary countries, local governments are grouped into deciles (or  " tenths " ) ranked in increasing order of fiscal capacity before 
equalisation. Both sections of the table show the Gini coefficients of fiscal capacity across sub-central governments, and the 
maximum and minimum fiscal capacity before and after receiving transfers. Year 2004 figures are used for OECD countries, 
except Germany (2005).

China follows the calculation method of Federal countries. Its Gini coefficient is calculated based on provincial-level fiscal data, 
weighted by population size.

Sweden. Revenue disparities within provinces have been reduced The large disparities within provinces have also been narrowed by intergovernmental transfers in 
recent years. This finding contrasts with the general observation in the literature that the transfer system 
had not reduced fiscal disparities at the sub-provincial level (Liu and Shih, 2004; Tsui, 2005; Zhang and 
Zheng, 2010). This is at least partly because few of these studies rest on recent data. By 2009, the overall 
redistributive effects of the transfers at the prefecture and county/district levels had become quite strong. 
For instance, transfers reduced the Theil index across all levels of sub-national government by 65% while ECO/WKP(2013)22 26 the Gini coefficient was reduced from 0.53 to 0.32 (Table 11). The fall in national fiscal inequality has 
been driven by a fall of within-province inequality at the county level. Table 11. The impact of transfers at sub-provincial levels on inequality of revenue In 2009 All sub-provincial units

disparities within provinces, the sub-provincial Gini coefficient remains at 0.32, much higher than the 0.18 
at the provincial level (Table 10). Across prefectures regional inequality is quite low. On the other hand, 
they do not appear to have been as successful in reducing fiscal inequalities in the counties for which they 
are responsible. One particular problem for county governments is that earmarked transfers often require 
matching funds which may not be available at county level. The extent of fiscal equalisation within a province varies across provinces. High provincial income 
levels are not associated with low intra-province inequalities, and vice versa (Figure 14). For instance, the 
coastal provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong display high incomes and high inequality. Even so, 
overall, between 2000 and 2010, there was a marked reduction in within-province inequality: the provinces 
with the highest initial fiscal inequality registered the largest drops (Figure 15). Figure 14.

Within provinces disparities in spending and service provision In many sectors, the delivery of public services largely depends on the number people employed in 
particular service areas. The bulk of local public spending on education, healthcare and general public 
services are salaries paid to civil servants, teachers, doctors and government administrative staff. Across 
provinces, there is much less disparity in the number of government employees than in overall spending 
(Figure 16, panel A). The dispersion in public spending within a province does not appear to be associated 
with the level of income (Figure 16, Panel B). The dispersion of spending within a province does, however, 
appear to be correlated with the dispersion of government employment (Figure 16, Panel C). However, the 
dispersion of government employment within a province is extremely low – a Gini coefficient of around 
0.03 seems typical. This might indicate that basic services are being provided on an equal basis, certainly 
on a much more equal basis than the expenditure data would suggest. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0

It is now seen as one of 
the fundamental goals for building a harmonious society through scientific development (CCP, 2006). In 
2012, the government set out a five year plan for improving basic public services that would form the basis 
for equalising basic public services for everyone by 2020 (Table 12). Specifically, the plan stresses the 
need to further reduce the impact of regional disparities on the provision of basic services in order to 
equalise access to services whether the person lives in an urban or a rural area. The Plan sets the scope,

National Five-Year Plan on Social and Economic Development, news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2011-03/16/c_121193916.htm In particular, the Plan addresses the issue of migrants, echoing the national policy framework on promoting 
sound urbanisation. The central government demands sub-national governments to improve public services 
for migrants in the areas of education, pension, healthcare and housing. Moreover, the urbanisation 
framework identifies the improvement of urban infrastructure as a priority, given the existing deficit in 
provision (Herd et al., forthcoming). To achieve the service delivery target, the Plan calls for improving public finances by: @BULLET clearly defining intergovernmental assignments and spending responsibilities across government 
tiers, and in particular assign pension and healthcare spending to provincial governments; 
@BULLET improving the intergovernmental transfer system, by increasing the percentage of general 
transfers and increasing the percentage of rules-based transfers and raising their amount 
especially at sub-provincial levels; ECO/WKP(2013)22 30 @BULLET promoting a sound public finance supporting system, by allocating certain profits from SOEs to 
service provision and improving the fiscal resources available to counties; 
@BULLET prioritising spending on health and social protection rather than  " economic activities " . The government has highlighted the use of general transfers as means of increasing equality of access to 
basic public services. This could involve, for example, grouping different earmarked project grants on 
education together into a block general purpose grant allocated to education. Local government would 
receive broad targets from higher governments rather than specific requirement to spend the money on 
specific elements in education. The number of such general purpose transfers has increased in the past few 
years and most involve some form of differentiation according to the relative income level of the province 
or its geographic location. Another approach would be to increase the size of the general grants whose 
most important element is funded by allocating the funds raised by the tax on personal incomes. Property taxation The introduction of taxation on residential property has been under consideration since 2003 as a 
means of improving local tax revenue. China does have both property and land taxes but they do not apply 
to residential real estate. The government has considered introducing a new residential property tax that 
might be used either to raise local spending or to reduce the reliance of local governments on transfers 
from higher levels of government. Most local governments in the OECD raise revenues from recurrent 
taxation on residential property in their area. This form of taxation provides a linkage between the level of 
local taxation and the provision of local services. It is a more common form of local taxation than local 
income or sales taxes as property cannot be moved whereas the tax base for a sales tax or an income tax 
can easily move. From the point of view of resource allocation, if the property tax can be levied 
exclusively on land rather than on the building on the land, then such a tax is one of the least distortionary 
taxes. Five types of taxes are levied on property and land transactions in China (Table 13). Using the OECD 
classification of taxes, only two of these would be classified as property taxes as they are levied annually 
and based on the ownership of property. Such taxes have not been levied on residential property since 
2007. Two of the other taxes are based on transactions either of property or land (but only when the land 
changes use from agricultural to constructed land). In addition, there is a special capital gains tax that 
applies only to land transactions. The tax on property transactions is one of the few taxes for which a 
provincial government can set the rate (23 set the rate at 3%, six at 4% and two at 5%). In addition, if a 
property in held for less than five years it is subject to the business tax at a rate of 5.5% on the sale of the 
property. Table 13. Characteristics of taxes on land and property Tax

Transaction Source: Beijing Municipal Tax Office ECO/WKP(2013)22 31 The recurrent property tax is levied only on commercial property. There are two formulae for 
calculating the tax burden: one applies a rate of 1.2% to the original value of the property less a 
depreciation deduction of between 10 and 30%; the other is based on 15% of the rent generated by the 
property. The urban land-use tax is based on a flat rate per occupied square metre. These two taxes are of 
much less importance to the government as a source of revenue than in the OECD area (Figure 17). A 
number of OECD countries raise between 3% and 4% of GDP in recurrent property taxes. Only four 
OECD countries raise less than in China, where such recurrent taxes amount to 0.5% of GDP (Table 14). 
The low yields are a reflection of the absence of taxation on residential real estate and of the fact that the 
tax on urban land use is not based on market values. Figure 17. Transactions and recurrent property taxation Percentage of GDP Source: OECD Revenue Statistics and China Statistical Yearbook. Table 14. Breakdown of property and land tax revenue In per cent of GDP 2007

Taxation of transaction ECO/WKP(2013)22 32 Two municipalities are piloting a recurrent tax on residential property. However, the design of these 
pilots is very restrictive with nearly all property exempted from paying the tax. In the first full year of the 
trial, the taxes raised only CNY 100 million and CNY 300 million in Chongqing and Shanghai respectively 
(0.00001% and 0.000015% of Gross Regional Product in the areas concerned). Besides the recurrent tax on property there are also taxes on property transactions. If the tax on land 
appreciation is a regarded as a tax on property, then China raises 1.2% of GDP from property transactions 
– four times the level in the OECD area. The yield is so high because property values are much higher 
relative to incomes in China than in the OECD area, and because the number of transactions is high due to 
the high rate of house construction. These factors more than offset the low level of second-hand property 
transactions and the relatively low rate of the transactions tax. Overall, the sum of taxation on transactions 
and usage in China (at 1.7%) of GDP is only slightly below the OECD average of 2.0% of GDP 
(Figure 17). However, the structure is more economically damaging in that it hinders turnover in the 
market, though the tax on land is economically efficient. Introducing a nationwide residential property tax would exacerbate differences in fiscal revenue 
across provinces. Past experience suggests that the tax rate would be uniform across the country. In this 
case, the revenue for the property tax would mainly accrue to prefectural-level cities and their districts, 
where the bulk of property is situated. Moreover, the level of property prices is highly correlated with the 
level of per capita income (in 2011, a 1% increase in per capita GDP was associated with a 0.7% increase 
in the average selling price of new property). Thus the property tax would accrue to the local authorities 
that rely least on transfers from central and provincial governments. The government also faces a dilemma in considering the introduction of a residential property tax. 
Potential property buyers will estimate the present value of future property taxes and reduce the price they 
are willing to pay by this discounted value. In turn this will reduce the price of the land-use right. But local 
governments own all land and rely on the sale of new land-use rights to finance urban infrastructure. Local authorities would probably lose revenue by introducing a residential property tax, at least while 
the expansion of urban areas continues. If property taxes were set at a level such that annual revenues rose 
to the average level in the OECD area, then the property tax rate would need to be set at 1% of the market 
value of properties as urban property values are equivalent to 1.25 times GDP. Assuming a real discount 
rate of 4%, this would lower house prices by 25% and land prices by 50%, given the average share of land 
in property prices. In 2012 the gross revenue from land sales amounted to just over 5% of GDP, so the fall 
in revenue from land-use rights would likely outweigh the increase in receipts from the property tax. 
Moreover, land-lease income accrues immediately to local governments' revenue, while it takes time to 
realise the anticipated level of property taxation in that tax rate and coverage could only be raised gradually 
from the level set in the pilot cases. Given that urbanisation is far from complete, local authorities have an 
interest to maintain the current system of land sales and no property tax at least until the process of 
urbanisation is nearly complete. At that point land sales will be much less important as a source of revenue. 
Over the longer term, property taxation would then represent a stable source of revenue – albeit one that 
would mainly accrue to the governments of richer areas. Conclusion The main features of China's current sub-national finance arrangements date back to the 1994 tax 
reform. China has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of 
tax sharing and transfers, and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. Local governments have 
hardly any discretionary power to modify taxation and are effectively agents acting on behalf of the central 
government in expenditure decisions, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and 
penalties. They can spend the profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to restrictions set by the central ECO/WKP(2013)22 33 government. As the 1994 tax reform recentralised revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps 
between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have grown. In order to accommodate a strong 
increase in the share of expenditure in the areas covered by sub-national government that has not been 
matched by increased tax revenues, the central government has increased the scale of the transfer system. 
Over the past decade, China's transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become 
markedly more redistributive. Nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much 
greater than between regions in OECD countries. The extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies, 
thus affecting the delivery of services. The government's plan to equalise service provision across the 
country therefore calls for fine-tuning the intergovernmental transfer system and improving local revenue. 
Some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that would substantially 
raise tax revenue. A significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of land-use 
rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have 
strong budgets. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ahmad, E., R. Singh and M. Fortuna (2004),  " Toward More Effective Redistribution: Reform Options for
