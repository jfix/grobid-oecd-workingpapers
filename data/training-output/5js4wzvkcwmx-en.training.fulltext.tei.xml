			<p>Some contracts will often contain elements of one or more of the above types of con-<lb/>tract. Thus, a contract to construct a building might include design services and certain<lb/> necessary supplies. Similarly, a supply contract may include siting and installation ser-<lb/>vices. The Directive contains specific rules that are used to classify these &apos;mixed con-<lb/>tracts&apos;.<lb/> A number of contracts are entirely excluded from the scope of the Directives (but not<lb/> necessarily of the Treaty), either because of their nature so it would be inappropriate to<lb/> apply the provisions of the Directives or because they are the subject of different sys-<lb/>tems of regulation or administration. Some contracts, the new &apos;reserved contracts&apos;, re-<lb/>ceive special treatment as a result of the identity of those supplying the goods, works<lb/> or services under them.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even if not excluded, contracts will only be subject to the provisions of the Directives<lb/> where their value exceeds the relevant monetary value set out in the Directives – the<lb/> EU financial threshold. These thresholds reflect the level at which it was assumed by<lb/> the Community Legislator that cross-border trade was likely (although it is possible<lb/> that, depending on the circumstances, tenderers may be interested in below-threshold<lb/> contracts in other EU Member States – it is to be recalled that the general principles<lb/> apply to the award of these contracts in any event). In order to prevent creative meth-<lb/>ods of calculating the value of the contracts to be awarded, the Directives also apply<lb/> rules and methods of calculation as well as prohibition of methods designed to circum-<lb/>vent the Directives by splitting, aggregating or packaging contracts in such a way that<lb/> the contracts do not properly fall within the appropriate provisions. For more discussion<lb/> on this issue</p>

			<head>see Public Procurement Brief 5: Understanding the EU Financial Thresh-<lb/>olds.<lb/></head>

			<p>One important distinction made by the Directives is between &apos;contracts&apos; and &apos;conces-<lb/>sions&apos;, the latter being treated differently from contracts. Special rules apply to the<lb/> award of works concessions in the Public Sector Directive, while services concessions<lb/> are excluded from the scope of both the Public Sector Directive and the Utilities Di-<lb/>rective.<lb/></p>

			<head>Common characteristics:</head>

			<p>There are some general characteristics that are common to<lb/> all types of contract covered by the Directives:<lb/></p>

			<p>The Directives apply to contracts for pecuniary interest concluded in writing between an<lb/> economic operator and a contracting entity, as follows:<lb/></p>

			<table>• The contract must be for pecuniary interest, i.e. for money or money&apos;s<lb/> worth. There must be a financial consideration, no matter how it is paid.<lb/> • The contract must be in writing. In the very unlikely event that a contract which<lb/> falls within the Directives is not in writing, it will be subject to the general applica-<lb/>tion of the rules contained in the Treaty<lb/> • The contract must be between two parties: the economic operator and the<lb/> contracting authority.<lb/></table>

			<head>When does a contract arise?<lb/></head>

			<p>When a new contract is awarded, there is normally little difficulty in identifying it. Some-<lb/>times, however, this is not obvious. For example, an existing contract might be amend-<lb/>ed or renewed. A contract may also be amended during its execution. All of these sit-<lb/>uations give rise to new obligations between the parties and may change the terms of<lb/> the original contract.<lb/></p>

			<p>If the result of the changes is so extensive that the renewed or amended contract is<lb/> fundamentally different from the original contract, then it may be the case that a new<lb/> contract will be established. If there is a new contract and all of the elements of a con-<lb/>tract are present, then the contract should be subject to the procurement rules, i.e. it<lb/> must be awarded according to the provisions of the Directives. This means that a sim-<lb/>ple extension, renewal or even amendment might not be permitted if it is made without<lb/> competition.<lb/></p>

			<head>What is a works contract?<lb/></head>

			<p>Works contracts are defined as those contracts that:<lb/> • have as their object either the execution or both the execution and design of<lb/> works related to one of the activities referred to in Annex I of the Public Sector<lb/> Directive (Annex XII of the Utilities Directive); or<lb/> • have as their object the realisation, by whatever means, of work corresponding<lb/> to the requirements specified by the contracting entity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The possibility of including design works in a works contract means that &apos;design and<lb/> build&apos; contracts may fall within the definition of a works contract. This could include, for<lb/> example, contracts covering the planning and financing of a project as well as its exe-<lb/>cution. Where design and construction are awarded separately, the design services<lb/> would be a priority service or could, alternatively, be awarded by means of a design<lb/> contest.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the second part of the definition, a &apos;work&apos; is the outcome of building or civil engi-<lb/>neering works taken as a whole that is sufficient in itself to fulfil an economic and tech-<lb/>nical function. This definition is relevant for a number of reasons, notably in the context<lb/> of the realisation of works by any means and for the purposes of assessing the thresh-<lb/>old values and, consequently, when deciding whether a single requirement for works<lb/> has been split up with a view to bringing contracts below the relevant threshold value.<lb/></p>

			<head>What is a supplies contract?<lb/></head>

			<p>The definition of supplies is rather more straightforward than that of works or services.<lb/> &apos;Public supply contracts&apos; are defined as contracts – other than works – involving the<lb/> purchase, lease, rental or hire purchase, with or without option to buy, of products. In<lb/> addition, the delivery of such products may include siting and installation operations.<lb/></p>

			<p>The range of products covered by the Directives can be seen in the various nomencla-<lb/>tures used to describe products for the purposes of advertising. See, for example, the<lb/> Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV).<lb/></p>

			<head>What is a services contract?<lb/></head>

			<p>SIGM A | Public Procurement Brief 4<lb/> 4<lb/></p>

			<p>The term &apos;service contracts&apos; essentially refers to contracts other than works or sup-<lb/>ply contracts that have as their object the provision of services referred to in Annex II of<lb/> the Public Sector Directive (Annex XVII of the Utilities Directive). A number of services<lb/> are specifically excluded, mainly because they are not amenable to purchase through<lb/> the rules provided by the Directives.<lb/></p>

			<head>Services contracts: The two-tier approach<lb/></head>

			<p>The Directives make a distinction between priority and non-priority services. This distinc-<lb/>tion is not made on the basis of the nature of the particular activity but rather on the po-<lb/>tential that exists for the provision of the services concerned across national borders and<lb/> on the clear capability of those services to affect trade between member states.<lb/></p>

			<p>This distinction becomes most readily apparent in the case of services, where those<lb/> listed in Annex IIB as non-priority, whilst capable of attracting localised competition, are<lb/> less amenable to international competition, either because of the nature of the services<lb/> (e.g. legal and administrative services that are based on familiarity with national laws<lb/> and jurisdiction) or because of the location in which they need to be provided (e.g. hotel<lb/> and restaurant services).<lb/> This does not mean that competition for such contracts is not possible, certainly at local<lb/> or national level, or even that international competition for them is inconceivable, but<lb/> only that the nature of the services or their value is such that this is less likely.<lb/></p>

			<p>The sixteen priority services, which are listed in Annex IIA of the Public Sector Di-<lb/>rective, are subject to the detailed award procedures and other provisions of the Direc-<lb/>tives.<lb/></p>

			<p>The non-priority services are subject only to a basic transparency regime that requires<lb/> adherence to the Directives&apos; rules on non-discriminatory technical specifications and<lb/> the obligation to publish the results of the award.<lb/></p>

			<head>How</head>

			<figure>is a contract classified when it includes a mix of different elements?<lb/></figure>

			<p>Contracts do need to be classified as works, services or supplies contracts because<lb/> different provisions of the Directive apply to different types of contract. Problems may<lb/> arise in deciding how a contract is to be correctly classified where a contract is a com-<lb/>bination of works and/or supplies and/or services. The Directives contain provisions on<lb/> how this is dealt with, for example:<lb/></p>

			<figure>Mixed priority and non-priority services contracts – value test: The Directives ap-<lb/></figure>

			<p>ply an explicit value test to services contracts that contain both priority and non-priority<lb/> services. Contracts will be for priority services where the value of the priority services<lb/> contained in the contract is greater than the value of the non-priority services. Con-<lb/>tracts will be for non-priority services where the value of the non-priority services con-<lb/>tained in the contract is greater than the value of the priority services.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Supplies/services – value test: Essentially, contracts containing elements of both<lb/> supplies and services will be treated as one or the other type of contract depending on<lb/> the value represented by each element.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The contract will be considered to be a services contract where the value of the services<lb/> performed is greater than the value of the products supplied. Where the value is equal, it<lb/> SIGM A | Public Procurement Brief 4<lb/> 5<lb/> will be considered as a supplies contract. The definition makes no distinction between<lb/> priority and non-priority services, with the effect that, where the value of non-priority ser-<lb/>vices in a mixed contract is greater than the value of supplies, the whole contract will be<lb/> treated as a contract for non-priority services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Works/services – principal object test:</head>

			<p>In the case of works and services, the Direc-<lb/>tives do not provide for a value test but include a test based on the principal object of<lb/> the contract.</p>

			<head>Insert example<lb/></head>

			<p>Works/supplies: Under the Directives, supplies contracts that also cover, as an inci-<lb/>dental matter, siting and installation operations, are defined as supplies contracts. For<lb/> example, in the case of the purchase of a crane to be installed on a dockside, the object of<lb/> the contract is the supply of the crane and not the works required to site it, even if those<lb/> works are considerable.<lb/> This &apos;principal object&apos; test, which mirrors the way in which works and services contracts<lb/> are to be distinguished, would appear to apply even if the value of siting or installation<lb/> services is greater than the value of the supplies itself, since it is a test based on the ob-<lb/>ject of the contract and not the value-based test applied to distinguish between supplies<lb/> and services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Are there other types of contracts subject to the Directives?<lb/></head>

			<p>Yes, the Directives apply to a number of other types of contract for which special award<lb/> procedures apply. These include subsidised works or subsidised services contracts,<lb/> contracts for subsidised housing schemes and works concession contracts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Frequently Asked Question 1:<lb/></head>

			<p>What is a PPP contract? The acronym PPP refers to &quot; Public-Private Partner-<lb/>ship &quot; . There is no single or simple definition of a PPP contract as the term covers<lb/> a range of different types of contracts and other delivery models. A PPP generally<lb/> involves an arrangement under which the contracting authority (the public sector)<lb/> enters into an agreement with a private sector organisation to deliver infrastruc-<lb/>ture or public services. The structure may be contractual or institutional, the latter<lb/> involving the setting up of a joint venture company or other joint venture organisa-<lb/>tion in which both the contracting authority and the private sector party participate<lb/> to deliver the infrastructure or services.<lb/> A key feature of PPPs tends to be the sharing or transfer of risk to the private<lb/> sector party and PPPs are often, but not always of long duration. Payment and<lb/> funding methods vary under PPPs. Payments may be by the contracting authority<lb/> or derived from third parties, such as users of the facilities, or be from a combina-<lb/>tion of sources. Funding may come from the contracting authority, the private<lb/> sector party, external funders such as banks or a combination of sources.<lb/></p>

			<p>Most PPP contracts will be subject to the full application of the Directives. See<lb/> FAQ 2 for comments on concession contracts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Frequently Asked Question 2:<lb/> What is a concession and is it covered by the Directives?</head>

			<p>A concession is a<lb/> contract of the same type as the contracts defined in the Directives except that<lb/> consideration for the works or services to be carried out, for example, consists<lb/> either solely in the right to exploit the work or service or in this right together with<lb/> payment.<lb/> A concessionaire often accepts the operational and financial risk of providing a<lb/> public service, in the broadest sense, in return for the chance of making a profit<lb/> through the exploitation of the &apos;service&apos;. Concessions may sometimes be classi-<lb/>fied as a form of PPP.<lb/></p>

			<p>Concessions are used, for example, to carry out and finance major infrastructure<lb/> projects, notably in respect of the construction of a road network, bridges or tun-<lb/>nels, where the concessionaire is remunerated by way of tolls charged to users.<lb/> They are also used, however, simply to provide for the operation and mainte-<lb/>nance (rather than construction) of facilities by concessionaires, such as where<lb/> an operator is given the concession to operate an existing railway or under-<lb/>ground railway infrastructure. The former types of concession are examples of<lb/> works concessions; the latter is an example of a services concession.<lb/></p>

			<p>Only public works concessions are dealt with comprehensively in the Public<lb/> Sector Directive.<lb/> The Public Sector Directive explicitly excludes coverage of services conces-<lb/>sions. The general principles of the Treaty continue to apply, however.<lb/></p>

			<head>Exemptions<lb/></head>

			<p>Even where contracts fall within the general definition of a public contract, some of<lb/> these contracts will be excluded from the scope of the Directives for a number of rea-<lb/>sons. Some are excluded because they are not, by their nature, amenable to competi-<lb/>tion. Some of the exclusions apply only to contracts of a specific type. Some are<lb/> excluded because governments wish to exclude them from competition for specific<lb/> reasons. There is also a category of &apos;reserved&apos; contracts that, although not excluded,<lb/> do benefit from preferential treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition the Public Sector Directive provides an exemption for those public contracts<lb/> that are otherwise covered by the Utilities Directive or for public contracts that, although<lb/> covered by the Utilities Directive in principle, are exempt from the provisions of that Di-<lb/>rective.<lb/></p>

			<head>Exemptions due to the nature of the contract<lb/></head>

			<p>Contracts for the acquisition of land: The Directives exclude contracts for the ac-<lb/>quisition or rental, by whatever financial means, of land, existing buildings or other im-<lb/>movable property, or for the acquisition of rights thereon. These contracts are excluded<lb/> because they relate to immovable property, which is naturally dependent on the geo-<lb/>graphic location. Such contracts take place essentially in local markets and their ob-<lb/>jects generally rule out any real prospect for cross-border competition.<lb/> It is important to note that development agreements and other types of property deals<lb/> may not necessarily fall within this exemption, most commonly because a works con-<lb/>tract is awarded a part of the overall arrangement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Exclusions relating specifically to services:</head>

			<p>These exclusions apply to specific cir-<lb/>cumstances, either based on the award of exclusive rights to certain authorities to carry<lb/> out certain services or on the nature of a number of specified services.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Services contracts provided on the basis of exclusive rights<lb/> • Broadcasting material and time<lb/> • Arbitration and conciliation services<lb/> • Certain financial services<lb/> • Employment contracts<lb/> • Some research and development contracts<lb/></p>

			<head>Exemptions by reason of choice<lb/></head>

			<p>These exemptions relate to procurement of a military nature, procurement requiring<lb/> secrecy, and procurement that, by agreement, is subject to different procurement rules.<lb/> All three types of exemption concern the Public Sector Directive.<lb/></p>

			<p>Defence procurement: for certain contracts awarded in the field of defence and secu-<lb/>rity, and not covered by the Defence Directive 2009/81, where it is necessary to protect<lb/> essential interests of security<lb/></p>

			<head>Contracts requiring secrecy measures:</head>

			<p>The Directives do not apply to public con-<lb/>tracts (i) that are declared secret, or (ii) the execution of which must be accompanied<lb/> by special security measures in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative<lb/> provisions in force in the member state concerned, or (iii) when the protection of the<lb/> essential interests of that state&apos;s security so requires.<lb/></p>

			<head>Contracts governed by other rules:</head>

			<p>The Directives does not apply to contracts that<lb/> are governed by different procedural rules and awarded:<lb/> • pursuant to an international agreement concluded in conformity with the EEC<lb/> Treaty between a member state and one or more third countries and covering<lb/> works, supplies or services intended for the joint implementation or exploitation of<lb/> a project by the signatory states;<lb/> • to undertakings in a member state or a third country in pursuance of an interna-<lb/>tional agreement relating to the stationing of troops;<lb/> • pursuant to the particular procedure of an international organisation such as the<lb/> United Nations, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or World<lb/> Bank.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reserved contracts<lb/></head>

			<p>The Directives introduced a new category of &apos;reserved&apos; contracts, which are not excluded<lb/> from the scope of the Directive but are subject to specific conditions of eligibility being<lb/> imposed on the participants.<lb/> EU Member States may reserve the right to participate in public contract award proce-<lb/>dures concerning sheltered workshops or may provide for such contracts to be per-<lb/>formed in the context of sheltered employment programmes, where most of the<lb/> employees concerned are handicapped persons who, by reason of the nature or seri-<lb/>ousness of their disabilities, cannot carry on occupations under normal conditions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Utilities<lb/> Exemptions specific to the utilities sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The Utilities Directive provides for sector-specific exemptions in a number of util-<lb/>ity sectors, based essentially on the degree of competition in these markets. Ex-<lb/>amples of these exemptions include contracts for the purchase of fuel for the<lb/> production of energy; purchases of water; bus transport services; and upstream<lb/> oil and gas exploration and exploitation. The Utilities Directive has also intro-<lb/>duced a new general exemption mechanism for activities exposed to competi-<lb/>tion in markets to which access is not restricted.<lb/> The Utilities Directive also contains a series of other exemptions specific to the<lb/> utilities sector including:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Activities outside the Community: The Directive does not apply to con-<lb/>tracts awarded by contracting entities for purposes other than the pursuit of<lb/> their relevant activities, or the pursuit of such activities in a third country, in<lb/> conditions that do not involve the physical use of a network or geographical<lb/> area within the Community.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Affiliated undertakings exemption: Where &apos;undertakings&apos; are made up of<lb/> a number of mutually owned or mutually dependant companies, the Utilities<lb/> Directive provides for a specific exemption for purchases made between<lb/> these companies under certain conditions. These purchases are treated as<lb/> &apos;in-house&apos; contracts, known as intra-group transactions. The contracts ex-<lb/>cluded, subject to meeting certain conditions, are those that have been<lb/> awarded to affiliates, whose essential purpose is to act as central service-<lb/>providers to the group to which they belong, rather than selling their ser-<lb/>vices commercially on the open market.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Purchases for re-sale or hire:</head>

			<p>The Directive excludes from its scope of<lb/> application any contracts that have been awarded for purposes of re-sale or<lb/> hire to third parties. This exclusion is intended to include contracts for<lb/> goods where the contracting entity intends to sell or hire the equipment<lb/> purchased in a competitive market. These contracts will only be excluded if<lb/> the contracting entity enjoys no special or exclusive right to sell or hire the<lb/> subject of such contracts and if other entities are free to sell or hire the<lb/> same goods under the same conditions as the contracting entity.<lb/></p>
