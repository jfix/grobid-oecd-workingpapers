            <table>4. It was estimated that continuous measuring of NO x emissions would cost each plant about SEK 350 000 (about EUR 37 000) every year.<lb/> These high costs made it necessary to limit the tax to relatively large plants. The very largest energy producers were, however, already obliged<lb/> to have equipment for continuous emission measurements installed, so the NO x tax did not imply any additional measurement costs.<lb/> Box 1 | Policy by design: the Swedish Environmental Charges Commission<lb/> The Environmental Charges Commission (ECC) was appointed in 1987 and its reports resulted in the<lb/> introduction of a number of new economic instruments as part of Swedish environmental policy (SOU,<lb/> 1989). The ECC included representatives from all parliamentary parties, the most relevant ministries, and<lb/> civil society. The ECC&apos;s proposal for the tax on NO x emissions was presented for broad public consultation,<lb/> and a large number of public and private stakeholders expressed their views, mainly in support of the main<lb/> lines of the proposal. The commission also proposed several other economic instruments, including CO 2<lb/> and SO 2 taxes.<lb/> 6 | OECD ENVIRONMENT POLICY PAPER NO. 2 © OECD 2013<lb/> The design solution: the Swedish NO x emissions tax and refund system<lb/> The policy, voted in by the Swedish Parliament on 1 January 1992, was to impose a high<lb/> tax on emissions of nitrogen oxides from energy generation at combustion plants. The<lb/> tax 5 was set at a rate of 40 SEK 6 for every kilogramme of NO x emitted from any stationary<lb/> combustion plant producing at least 50 megawatt hours (MWh) of useful 7 energy per<lb/> year. This corresponds to 6 000 USD/tonne, much higher than the hundreds of dollars<lb/> usual in the US programmes for NO x permits (Sterner and Höglund-Isaksson, 2006).<lb/> </table>
<lb/> 
            <figDesc>The most innovative feature of this tax, however, was that all the revenue raised (except<lb/> administration costs) 8 would be returned to the participating plants in proportion to<lb/> their production of useful energy. This means that firms emitting low volumes of NO x<lb/> per unit of energy produced are net beneficiaries of the scheme – only firms with large<lb/> NO x emissions per energy unit are net tax payers. This feature of the system encourages<lb/> the targeted plants to reduce their emissions of nitrogen oxides per unit of energy to<lb/> the lowest possible level and avoids distorting the pattern of competition between those<lb/> plants subject to the NO x tax and those that are not (SEPA, 2006). Another important<lb/> feature of the tax was that it was based on mandatory continuous monitoring of<lb/> emissions.</figDesc>

<lb/> 
            <table>The reduction in emissions of NO X cannot solely be ascribed to the effect of the NO X tax<lb/> system. A large number of boilers are also subject to specific regulations stipulated in the<lb/> plants&apos; operating permits under the Environmental Code (SEPA, 2006). They must also comply<lb/> with parallel quantitative standards both for NO X and other pollutants, and emissions may<lb/> also have fallen through cost-effectiveness activities unrelated to NO X reduction (Sterner and<lb/> Höglund, 2005).<lb/> </table>
<lb/> 
            <figDesc>Lena Höglund-Isaksson and Thomas Sterner analysed 626 combustion plants that were<lb/> regulated by the NO X tax for at least one year between 1992 and 2007 (OECD, 2010a). In<lb/> Figure 7, the plants have been plotted in order of increasing emission intensities against the<lb/> cumulative energy output of the plants. This illustrates how emission intensities in later years<lb/> are considerably lower than in 1992 when the tax was introduced. For example, in 1992, the<lb/> plants were producing 3 000 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy while emitting around 550 kg<lb/> NO X per GWh. Sixteen years later, in 2007, the plants were able to produce the same amount<lb/> of energy while emitting less than 181 kg NO X per GWh – an improvement of 67%. There are<lb/> three main explanations for this:<lb/> •<lb/> Cumulative energy output produced by the plants increased by 74% over the<lb/> period. The expansion in output mostly took place in plants that were relatively<lb/> emission-efficient.<lb/> •<lb/> Regulated plants invested in NO x mitigation and were therefore able to produce<lb/> more energy output with fewer emissions.<lb/> •<lb/> Innovations in mitigation technology made it possible to reach even lower emission<lb/> intensity levels for the same output level.<lb/> Some of these explanations are explored further below.<lb/> Stimulating innovation<lb/> The design of the Swedish NO x tax has stimulated demand for new technologies. It has<lb/> done so through: (1) the refund system, which promotes competition to achieve the lowest<lb/> NO x emissions per unit of energy produced; and (2) its requirement to install equipment<lb/> to monitor NO x emissions on a continuous basis. This has driven demand for several new<lb/> technologies for pre-combustion, combustion, post-combustion and monitoring, as well as<lb/> energy efficiency (OECD, 2010a). Box 4 | Promoting innovation through carbon pricing<lb/> The impact of the tax on innovations for reducing NO x emissions has been studied by the<lb/> OECD (OECD, 2010a and 2010b). In 1992 – the year the tax was introduced – only 7% of the<lb/> plants subject to the NO x tax reported to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency<lb/> (SEPA) that they had NO x abatement technologies installed. A year later, 62% of plants<lb/> reported having some kind of NO x abatement technology installed, and this share increased<lb/> to 72% in 1995. An analysis of patents lodged for<lb/> combustion and post-combustion technology<lb/> shows that in Sweden there appears to have<lb/> been continuous activity in this field since 1988,<lb/> especially between 1988 and 1993. The intense<lb/> activity during this particular period coincides<lb/> with the introduction of quantitative standards<lb/> for NO x in 1988 and the NO x charge in 1992.<lb/> </figDesc>

<lb/> 
            <table>Box 3 | What do other countries do?<lb/> In 2007 and 2010, Norway and Denmark introduced taxes on NO x emissions at rates of EUR 2.1 and EUR<lb/> 0.7 per kg NO x respectively. These had a broader sectoral coverage than in Sweden, but did not include a<lb/> refund system. The Danish tax rate was increased to EUR 3.4 per kg NO x in July 2012. The tax rate applied<lb/> in Norway is based on an estimate of the value of the damage caused by one kg of NO x emitted. However,<lb/> strong industry opposition in Norway has led to exemptions for emission sources covered by environmental<lb/> agreements with the state concerning the implementation of measures to reduce NO x in accordance with<lb/> a predetermined environmental target. Taxes on NO x emissions have also been introduced in several other<lb/> countries – such as France, Italy and Galicia in Spain – but in most cases, the tax rates are quite modest.<lb/> The French tax on NO x emissions was introduced in 1990 as part of a combined package to reduce<lb/> emissions of the air pollutants SO 2 , NO x and VOC from large combustion plants. Revenues from the charge<lb/> were destined to subsidise investments in abatement technology in regulated plants and for research and<lb/> development of abatement technology. Due to concerns about distortions in competitiveness, the tax rate<lb/> was set very low – about 1% of the Swedish NO x charge. There was also no requirement for continuous<lb/> monitoring of emissions. Both factors are mentioned by Millock, Nauges and Sterner as important<lb/> explanations for why the French NO x tax did not have any measured effect on NO x emissions (cited in<lb/> OECD, 2010a).</table>
