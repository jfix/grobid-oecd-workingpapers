			<body>Executive Summary <lb/>This paper examines the relationship between imports – and trade more generally – <lb/>and employment in France. It builds on the burgeoning literature relating trade and labour <lb/>markets, taking into account theories of firm-level trade and previous empirical work. <lb/>The renewed interest in the relationship between trade and labour markets is driven by the <lb/>availability of new data as well as a better theoretical understanding of firm-level trade. <lb/>Previous studies analysing the link between trade and employment in France were not <lb/>conclusive, leaving room for further research on the causal relationship between the two <lb/>as well as the underlying factors responsible for particular employment outcomes. <lb/>For instance, Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) examine the role of imports and exports <lb/>on employment in the manufacturing sector in France and find a negative association <lb/>between imports and employment. They distinguish between two types of imported <lb/>goods: &quot; finished goods &quot; and &quot; intermediate inputs &quot; – an approach adopted in this study as <lb/>well. They find evidence that firms importing finished goods always destroy more <lb/>employment than firms only importing intermediate inputs, which may reflect the impact <lb/>of outsourcing. Conversely, exports of finished goods have a positive employment effect <lb/>and exports of other goods a negative one. Kramarz (2010) complements Biscourp and <lb/>Kramarz (2007) by examining potential causes for these results. He attempts to verify if <lb/>foreign outsourcing, and in particular offshoring, is a possible response to the high wages <lb/>and strong unions in France. He also assesses the impact of increased outsourcing on <lb/>wages and employment. He is able to this by computing competitors&apos; importing <lb/>behaviour as well as employment changes and the strength of unions in firms. His <lb/>estimates show that the group of firms facing stronger unions indeed increased <lb/>outsourcing and, simultaneously, reduced employment over the period from 1986 to <lb/>1992. Meanwhile, firms facing weaker unions did exactly the opposite. <lb/>The present paper builds on the findings of Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) and <lb/>Kramarz (2010), extending the previous analysis in three important ways: 1) Due to <lb/>changes in the composition of trade (in terms of products and country of destination and <lb/>origin), a more recent period is covered (1995-2004); 2) An industry dimension is <lb/>introduced on top of the aggregate analysis of the manufacturing sector, providing <lb/>additional insights into industry heterogeneity; 3) Finally, given that Biscourp and <lb/>Kramarz (2007) is the only study that found a negative association between imports and <lb/>employment, the analysis provided here gives further empirical scrutiny to their results. <lb/>In order to perform empirical analysis, this study uses data from three different <lb/>sources, merged together in a lengthy matching process: 1) data on imports and exports <lb/>obtained from the French customs records; 2) data on firm-level economic variables <lb/>derived from FICUS (fichier complet unifié de SUSE or the Unified and Complete File <lb/>from SUSE); and 3) the data on employment and wages derived from the so-called <lb/></body>

			<body>DADS (Déclaration Annuelle de Données Sociales). The analysis is divided into three <lb/>sub-periods: 1995-1998, 1998-2001 and 2001-2004. <lb/>The analysis yields unexpected results. One might have expected that an increase in <lb/>the number of imported products would be associated with substitution effects (and thus, <lb/>decreased employment) and that an increase in the number of exported products might be <lb/>associated with an expansionary effect (and thus, increased employment). The study, <lb/>however, finds contrary evidence. Namely, when the number of exported products <lb/>increases, the effect on employment in France is clearly negative for all periods. <lb/>Interestingly, an opposite phenomenon appears to be associated with an increase in the <lb/>number of products imported: more products imported are associated with an increase in <lb/>employment. Across various specifications and samples the main message remains <lb/>robust: export intensity is associated with employment losses. Moreover, the finding that <lb/>purchases of final goods, including imports, put negative pressure on employment, while <lb/>there is no such relation between purchases of intermediates and employment, is <lb/>consistent with the results in Biscourp and Kramarz (2007). The analysis of imports using <lb/>such a division into goods and intermediates yields yet finer results, which vary from <lb/>period to period. The impact of exports on employment growth is, however, negative in <lb/>each and every sub-period. <lb/>The industry-level analysis further confirms these findings. First, all of the <lb/>manufacturing industries covered in the study tend to lose jobs. Second, in an <lb/>overwhelming number of cases, growth of exports is associated with employment losses <lb/>(the only exception is the automobile industry between 1995 and 1998). In addition, for <lb/>most industries, but equipment goods, increased purchases of goods are associated with <lb/>decreased employment. In the equipment goods industry a clearly positive employment <lb/>impact of increased purchases of goods might reflect the nature of investment goods <lb/>imported in this case. <lb/>Overall, there are some general patterns in our findings that appear to be stable. In <lb/>most cases, the association between export growth and employment creation does not go <lb/>necessarily in the expected direction. Similarly, import growth has effects on employment <lb/>that vary with the period and the industry. Finally, the most stable factor affecting <lb/>employment negatively appears to be purchases of goods, either from a French firm or <lb/>from a foreign one. The estimates obtained when distinguishing between imports of <lb/>goods and imports of intermediates are reminiscent of those of Biscourp and Kramarz <lb/>(2007). Interestingly, the papers that have tried to reproduce those results for other <lb/>countries have not managed to find the same effect. Hence, the findings presented here <lb/>for the recent period together with those for the period from 1986 to 1992 in Biscourp and <lb/>Kramarz (2007) seem to vindicate those by Kramarz (2010), for whom offshoring in <lb/>France is a result of strong unions – a French specificity. <lb/></body>

			<body>1. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>The literature relating trade and labour markets is burgeoning. Many reasons explain <lb/>this renewed interest. First, theories of firm-level trade have become widely available and <lb/>accepted. Melitz (2003) is the leading contender. Namely, his study introduces firm <lb/>heterogeneity in a General Equilibrium framework and clearly enriches our understanding <lb/>of firms trading. Second, data are a factor. Firm-level measures of total exports were used <lb/>in a series of papers by Bernard and Jensen to document firm behaviour. <lb/>Recently, data and theory were brought together in a structural framework strongly <lb/>confirming the validity of a modified Melitz model (Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz, <lb/>forthcoming). Because the firm was the unit of observation, a set of papers started to look <lb/>at labour market variables (essentially wages and employment) in conjunction with firm-<lb/>level trade activity. These papers, mostly empirical, have shown the potential positive <lb/>impact of exports on wages and employment, apparently because these exporting firms <lb/>had better productivity than their non-exporting equivalents. In addition, the recently <lb/>available matched employer-employee data sources have allowed analysts to capture a <lb/>more complete view of the labour market by looking at individual wages within the trade <lb/>environment. <lb/>These empirical efforts have been recently vindicated by various theoretical <lb/>frameworks designed to capture the lessons of Melitz&apos; success in modelling firms&apos; <lb/>exporting behaviour while simultaneously introducing the labour market, often within the <lb/>Mortensen-Pissarides perspective, as a way of modelling frictions. The most prominent <lb/>example is Helpman, Itzhokhi, Redding (2010). Other proposals are on the table and one <lb/>of them mixing Melitz with the concept of bargaining has been proposed by Eaton, <lb/>Kortum, Kramarz and Sampognaro (2011). Work in this area is ongoing and any new <lb/>findings will, admittedly, be most welcome. This is what I propose here in this empirical-<lb/>descriptive contribution. I will first summarize previous findings from an earlier study on <lb/>a similar question, which used a similar type of approach for France for the period from <lb/>1986 to 1992. Then, I will describe the multiple data sources that were used for the <lb/>present paper. In the next section, I will present aggregate results, followed by estimates <lb/>for different manufacturing industries. Finally, I will briefly conclude outlining possible <lb/>explanations for our potentially surprising findings. <lb/>2. <lb/>Previous findings for France <lb/>Following Bernard and Jensen (1997), Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) adopt a very <lb/>descriptive perspective in order to examine the role of imports and exports on <lb/>employment. Their empirical analysis comprises three stages. First, they study the <lb/>relation between trade and job creation and job destruction in the manufacturing sector <lb/>using a quasi-exhaustive panel of firms. This file includes, in particular, very small firms. <lb/>Then, they examine the relation between trade and skill structure, using measures of the <lb/>share of production jobs in total employment of manufacturing firms and of the fraction <lb/>of unskilled workers within these production jobs. Unfortunately, the size of the sample is <lb/>reduced because the Survey on Skill Structure includes only establishments with at least <lb/>20 employees. Following the literature they apportion the total job changes to between-<lb/>industry effects, within-industry but between-firm effects, and within-firms effects of <lb/>skill changes. Finally, they examine the robustness of their results by introducing firm-<lb/>level measures of innovation, which control for changes in the technology environment. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">8 – EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004) <lb/>OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124© OECD 2011 <lb/>At each stage, they relate changes in employment or skill structure, both measured at <lb/>the firm-level between 1986 and 1992, to changes in trade activity, also measured at the <lb/>firm-level and over the same period. When they use their exhaustive manufacturing data <lb/>set, they also compare the contributions of firms that are present at both ends of the <lb/>sample period with those that die or are born during the period. <lb/>Again, because their data allow them to identify the categories of imported goods <lb/>(using a 3-digit classification), they distinguish between two types of imported goods at <lb/>each stage of their analysis (following Feenstra and Hanson, 1995 and 1996). When the <lb/>classification of the imported good exactly coincides with that of the importing firm, they <lb/>label the imported good as &quot; finished &quot; . Otherwise, they label the imported good <lb/> &quot; intermediate input &quot; . This concept of finished goods tries to capture outsourcing <lb/>strategies in which the production process is segmented and incorporates finished inputs <lb/>from abroad (Fontagné, Freudenberg, and Unal-Kesenci, 1995; Venables, 1999). <lb/></note>

			<body>These authors find evidence that firms importing &quot; finished goods &quot; (FG) always <lb/>destroy more employment than firms only importing &quot; intermediary inputs &quot; (II), <lb/>conditional on changes in local purchases. The former type of imports may reflect <lb/>outsourcing strategies. Imports from low-wage countries have a slightly more negative <lb/>association than average imports, but the difference is minor. Exports of &quot; finished <lb/>goods &quot; , i.e. of goods normally produced by the firm, are positively associated with <lb/>employment changes, but exports of other goods have a robust negative effect, potentially <lb/>reflecting FDI. <lb/>Turning to skills, they find the usual result, i.e. that most changes occur within firms, <lb/>a fact often interpreted as evidence of skill-biased technical change. Using a regression <lb/>framework, Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) find that FG imports have a negative <lb/>association with production labour, as well as unskilled labour (at least in the largest <lb/>firms). Controlling for innovation taking place at the firm level does not alter any of their <lb/>conclusions. <lb/>Kramarz (2010) complements Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) in his study of potential <lb/>causes for these results. The paper notes that imports from developing countries to the <lb/>United States or Western Europe were not huge at the end of the 1980s. However, the <lb/>Single Market Program (SMP, hereafter), an attempt to establish the European <lb/>Community&apos;s (EC, hereafter) internal market, was conceived in 1985 and launched in <lb/>1988, with the hope of being fully implemented around 1992. This entailed decreased <lb/>tariffs and barriers within the EC. Hence, imports from the EC increased at a very rapid <lb/>pace in France during the second half of the 1980s. 1 In this context, the mere existence of <lb/>1. <lb/>French National accounts show that imports increased at a very fast rate over the years 1986 to <lb/>1992: above 6% per year in the first five years with a decrease in the pace of expansion to 3% in <lb/>1991 and 2% in the final year. In fact, whereas import growth was at best mild between 1981 and <lb/>1985, our sample period appears to be the beginning of a period of rapid growth for French <lb/>imports <lb/>that <lb/>continued <lb/>most <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>ensuing <lb/>years. <lb/>www.insee.fr/fr/indicateur/cnat_annu/Series/t_1501p_25_4.xls (accessed 5 April 2005). In <lb/>addition, Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) show that imports from low-wage countries were -and <lb/>remained – a minor, albeit increasing, component of imports of goods over the analysis period. <lb/>However, when measuring imports of manufacturing goods as a fraction of GDP, the ratio was <lb/>14% in 1986 (as well as in the preceding years -1981 to 1985). It increased to 17% in 1989-1990 <lb/>and 16% in 1992. <lb/>(www.insee.fr/fr/indicateur/cnat_annu/base_95/principaux_resultats/commerce_ext.htm/t_1501bis <lb/>_95.xls and t_1105_95.xls (accessed 26 February 2008). <lb/></body>

			<body>new sourcing options was a signal that foreign outsourcing was a potential threat, in <lb/>particular for industries or firms in which high wages were due to the presence of strong <lb/>unions and the absence of product market competition. At the same time, and for the <lb/>same reasons, because European firms could export to France more easily, French firms <lb/>faced increased market pressures, not from Beijing but from other European countries. <lb/>Similarly, in the United States, union plants and firms started to lose employment in <lb/>the 1980s. Many such plants were located in the North and new plants started to open in <lb/>the non-union South. Foreign-owned car plants started opening in the second half of the <lb/>1980s, in particular around Interstate 85. 2 This move to the South also took place in other <lb/>industries (see the example of RCA in its various guises described in Cowie, 1999). Of <lb/>course, in the case of the United States, &quot; imports &quot; may not be the right word and the <lb/>evidence that unions caused job losses and the associated outsourcing, be it local or <lb/>foreign, is missing. But, France is a small country when compared with the United States; <lb/>what is local outsourcing in the United States may be foreign in the analogous situation in <lb/>France (to the East though, rather than to the South, at least during the analysis period). <lb/>The two questions that Kramarz (2010) examines derive from a previous paper: 1) In <lb/>a context of increased competitive pressures and expanded opportunities due to the SMP, <lb/>was foreign outsourcing, in particular the foreign outsourcing of final goods (offshoring, <lb/>hereafter), a possible response to the high wages and strong unions, in particular in those <lb/>years that followed the election of the French socialist government?; 2) And, indeed, what <lb/>was the impact of increased outsourcing on wages and employment? 3 <lb/>Even though macro-economists have examined these questions both theoretically and <lb/>empirically, at the country-or the industry-level, there is virtually no micro-econometric <lb/>analysis, no empirical examination of the precise mechanisms at work using microdata <lb/>sources. Kramarz (2010) looks at the effects that can be identified in the French context <lb/>using differences across and within firms, rather than across industries. More precisely, <lb/>because he has access to administrative data on the nature and amount of imports and <lb/>exports measured at firm-level in France (final goods versus intermediates), he observes <lb/>all firms that outsource intermediates or final goods, and he can compute the firms&apos; <lb/>competitors importing behaviour. Moreover, thanks to access to administrative data on <lb/>balance-sheets and employment, he can compute the firms&apos; value-added or employment. <lb/>Also, by virtue of having access to a survey on union behaviour, he can compute the <lb/>strength of unions in most firms. Finally, because he uses administrative longitudinal <lb/>matched employer-employee data on wages, he can measure the changes in individual, <lb/>not aggregate, wages. <lb/>A clear answer to Kramarz (2010)&apos;s questions would contribute to at least two strands <lb/>of the literature. First, it would inform the wage inequality debate. 4 Second, because <lb/>2. <lb/>See for instance www.csmonitor.com/2008/1205/p01s04-usec.html or <lb/>www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-07-08-1004622626_x.htm among many other press <lb/>reports. <lb/>3. <lb/>In this text, I will equate outsourcing with outsourcing from foreign origin. <lb/>4. <lb/>On one side, Lawrence (1994), Lawrence and Slaughter (1993), Krugman (1995) have argued that <lb/>recent changes cannot be accounted for by increased trade with low-wage countries. On the other, <lb/>Wood (1995) has accused trade of being responsible for the deteriorated position of unskilled <lb/>workers while Leamer (1994) and (1996), and Freeman (1995) appear to stand in the middle. <lb/>Unfortunately, evidence is not compelling and mostly relies on import penetration measured at the <lb/>10 – EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004) <lb/>OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124© OECD 2011 <lb/>product market competition is a potential underlying mechanism affecting the labour <lb/>market, an answer would also contribute to the literature that examines the relationship <lb/>between wages, bargaining institutions, and profits. 5 <lb/>To understand the identification strategy that Kramarz (2010) pursues, the following <lb/>thought experiment is helpful. French manufacturing was relatively protected from <lb/>international competition at the beginning of the 1980s. In addition, a relatively large <lb/>fraction of firms were state-owned (as compared to other similar Western European <lb/>countries), in particular after the election of President François Mitterrand. This lack of <lb/>competition induced the creation of rents (a result documented in Abowd, Kramarz, <lb/>Lengermann, and Roux, 2007). Because of these rents as well as the bargaining <lb/>institutions, many French firms bargained with their workers, but not all. These <lb/>bargaining regimes varied from firm to firm. Some unions were in better position to seize <lb/>the potential rents. However, all firms were hit by exogenous foreign competition shocks. <lb/>In particular, all French firms were affected by the introduction of SMP at the end of the <lb/>1980s, facing increased foreign competition and increased opportunities for outsourcing. <lb/>Biscourp and Kramarz (2007), based on the same data on trade (imports as well as <lb/>exports) and on firms, also covering the same time period that I use in the present paper, <lb/>have shown that import growth (of final goods) was strongly associated with employment <lb/>losses. They show an association, but no causal relationship. The increased imports from <lb/>competitors&apos; or increased outsourcing had, nevertheless, the potential to affect the <lb/>bargaining process because they were likely to change a firm&apos;s ability to pay the workers <lb/>– the size of the quasi-rent – as well as the firm&apos;s and the workers&apos; threat points. What <lb/>happened to wages and employment in these different firms and under these different <lb/>bargaining regimes? How did unions react? If Kramarz (2010) is able to show, both <lb/>theoretically and empirically, that strong unions caused offshoring, which in turn caused <lb/>employment and wage losses, he has found a causal mechanism for Biscourp and <lb/>Kramarz&apos;s result. <lb/>With these thought experiments in the back of our minds, let us now present the <lb/>structure of Kramarz&apos;s paper. To capture the influence of outsourcing threats on <lb/>bargaining, Kramarz starts by presenting a simple model, particularly well-suited to the <lb/>French institutional setup studied here. It will help us capture the mechanisms through <lb/>which a firm&apos;s outsourcing of final goods can directly affect wages and employment. In <lb/>particular, the model shows that, with imperfect competition in the product market, firms <lb/>facing strong unions are likely to use offshoring more intensively than firms facing <lb/>weaker unions. This is because increased offshoring reduces the size of the rent that the <lb/>union and the firm bargain over. Indeed, offshoring acts as a threat point in the bargaining <lb/>process and disciplines workers. 6 Furthermore, in this context, employment decreases <lb/>aggregate or at the sectoral level (see for instance Revenga, 1992, see however Bernard and <lb/>Jensen, 1997 or the book edited by Robert Feenstra, 2000). <lb/>5. <lb/>Abowd and Lemieux (1993) examine the relation between product market competition and wages <lb/>in a bargaining framework whereas Blanchflower, Oswald and Sanfey (1996) look at the more <lb/>general relation between profits and wages. Goldberg and Tracy (2001) as well as Bertrand (2004) <lb/>focus on recent changes induced by increased import competition and movements in exchange <lb/>rates. Unfortunately, these last authors used industry-level measures of imports because of the lack <lb/>of firm-level data. <lb/>6. <lb/>A threat point, also known as the disagreement point v in a game-theoretical context of <lb/>bargaining, is the value the players can expect to receive if negotiations break down and no <lb/>bargain can be reached. <lb/>EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004) – 11 <lb/>OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124 © OECD 2011 <lb/>when offshoring increases. But, wages do not necessarily decrease (as they are the <lb/>outcome of the bargaining process, albeit with altered payoff scenarios). <lb/>Kramarz&apos;s (2010) empirical analysis starts by showing how foreign outsourcing and, <lb/>more generally, trade competition are related to the size of the rents at the end of the <lb/>1980s in French manufacturing. In particular, using a size-of-the-firm discontinuity <lb/>present within French institutions, he shows that bargaining institutions are likely to cause <lb/>the observed structure of this relationship. Because bargaining institutions matter and, in <lb/>particular, unions&apos; strength, he identifies which firms face strong unions, i.e. unions with a <lb/>strong bargaining power, and which firms face weaker unions. To do this, he estimates a <lb/>structural wage equation that directly identifies unions&apos; bargaining power. His use of <lb/>matched employer-employee data sources allows him to directly measure the various <lb/>components of this structural equation. <lb/>Kramarz&apos;s (2010) estimates demonstrate that there are essentially two types of firms, <lb/>depending on their bargaining regime: 1) firms facing strong unions in which workers <lb/>capture half of the rents and 2) firms facing weaker unions where workers are paid their <lb/>opportunity wage. Moreover, he highlights that workers are negatively affected by import <lb/>competition. Finally, the paper shows that the first group of firms (i.e. with strong unions) <lb/>indeed increased outsourcing and, simultaneously, reduced employment over the 1986-<lb/>1992 period, as predicted by the model, whereas the second group (i.e. firms with weaker <lb/>unions) did exactly the opposite. <lb/>There are several additional elements, absent from the above papers, which deserve <lb/>attention. First, the time period covered by the studies is from 1986 to 1992. There is a <lb/>good reason for this: after 1992, customs data do not capture the full extent of trade since <lb/>all movements within the European Union that are below a given threshold are not <lb/>reported anymore. However, the composition of trade (in terms of products and country <lb/>of destination or origin) has obviously changed. Second, the analysis was performed for <lb/>manufactures in the aggregate. Some industry dimension would certainly be useful. <lb/>Third, the results found in the above paper (Biscourp and Kramarz, 2007) show a <lb/>negative association between employment and imports. It is the only paper having found <lb/>such results (a Danish paper finds a positive correlation for small and medium size firms <lb/>and a negative relation for larger firms). A natural question then ensues: Why? And who <lb/>is right? <lb/>For instance, the role of unions in the firms&apos; decision to offshore has not been <lb/>extensively studied. Can we find similar results to the ones above when examining the <lb/>period from 1995 to -2004 (for which similar data are available)? Some of these questions <lb/>are addressed in the following analysis. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. <lb/>Data description <lb/>This paper uses data from various sources. First, I will describe the data on imports <lb/>and exports (Customs). Then, I will explain the data on firm-level economic variables <lb/>(FICUS). Also, I will present a third source, the so-called DADS, with data on <lb/>employment (and potentially wages), coming from LEED (Longitudinal Employer-<lb/>Employee Data). Finally, I will describe the lengthy control and matching process of <lb/>these three data sets. <lb/>The customs data set <lb/>Up to 1992 all shipments of goods entering or leaving France were declared to French <lb/>customs either by their owners or by authorized customs commissioners. Starting in 1993, <lb/>only shipments above a certain level (essentially 1 million French Francs) for and from <lb/>countries within Europe were declared (different denominations and composition had to <lb/>be declared depending on the year). However, firms often declared amounts below the <lb/>threshold. Hence, I keep every declaration. These declarations constitute the basis of all <lb/>French trade statistics. Each shipment generates a record. Each record contains the firm <lb/>identifier, the SIREN – a unique number that identified each firm in France, the country <lb/>of origin (for imports) or destination (for exports), a product identifier (a 6-digit <lb/>classification), and a date. All records are aggregated first at the monthly level. In the data <lb/>files accessible to researchers, these records are further aggregated by year and by 3-digit <lb/>product (NAP 100 classification, the equivalent of the 3-digit SIC code) until 1992 and, <lb/>for the period from 1995 to 2004 that I study, I kept a more disaggregated (4-digit) <lb/>product classification. Therefore, each observation is identified by a SIREN, a product <lb/>code, a country code, an import or export code, and a year. In the following analysis, I <lb/>restrict attention to all firms in the manufacturing sector in years 1995, 1998, 2001, and in <lb/>year 2004. Hence, I aggregate across manufacturing products exported or imported. I can, <lb/>thus, measure each firm&apos;s amount of total exports and imports in the four sample years <lb/>that I examine by country of destination or origin. Transactions are recorded in French <lb/>Francs and reflect the amount received by the firm (i.e. including discounts, rebates, etc.). <lb/>Because I also use data produced after 2002, all amounts have been translated into Euros <lb/>in order to allow comparisons. For instance, the data in 2001 has 4 455 014 observations. <lb/>Aggregated by firm, there are 118 562 observations for imports and 120,793 for exports. <lb/>To obtain more detailed information about the type of product imported, I follow <lb/>Biscourp and Kramarz in defining two types: intermediates and finished goods. <lb/>Whenever the product classification of the imported product is within the same <lb/>classification as that defining the main activity of the firm (at the 4-digit level), the <lb/>imported product is labelled &quot; finished good &quot; ; otherwise it is labelled &quot; intermediate &quot; . <lb/>Roughly, two-thirds of the imported products are intermediates. <lb/>The FICUS data set <lb/>The FICUS data base provides firm-level information. FICUS is the outcome of the <lb/>SUSE system, (SUSE stands for Système Unifié de Statistique d&apos;Entreprises or Unified <lb/>System of Firm-level Statistics). Its goal is to establish a consistent set of firm-level <lb/>variables and statistics by the joint use of two base sources. The first one is fiscal in its <lb/>origin and groups the bénéfices industriels et commerciaux (BIC) and the bénéfices non <lb/>commerciaux (BNC), two fiscal regimes that cover essentially all French firms. The other <lb/>one, the annual survey of firms (EAE. enquête annuelle d&apos;entreprises) is statistical in <lb/></body>

			<body>nature and is the outcome of a complex procedure in which both the Ministry of Industry <lb/>and the industry branches, as represented by the business unions, take part. It allows the <lb/>analyst to study the productive system from various angles: production, inputs, revenue <lb/>and expense accounts, balance-sheet and economic performance of firms. To facilitate the <lb/>exploitation of this complex and rich source, a unique file has been created, the so-called <lb/>FICUS (fichier complet unifié de SUSE, the unified and complete file from SUSE) <lb/>mentioned earlier. This file essentially covers all firms and all fiscal regimes, with the <lb/>exception of the micro-BIC (very small firms with sales below EUR 80 000 in 2011, <lb/>EUR 35 000 for service firms), agricultural firms (Bénéfice Agricole) and farms under the <lb/>BIC regime. It also contains all industries except for agriculture, both for metropolitan <lb/>France and the overseas departments. Furthermore, it includes a broad but limited number <lb/>of economic and accounting variables (simplified balance sheet and simplified revenue <lb/>and expense accounts). For instance, it contains total sales, total labour costs, value-<lb/>added, total employment, total purchases and profits. Focusing on three sub-periods of <lb/>low inflation, 1995-1998, 1998-2001, and 2001-2004, I use these variables measured in <lb/>nominal terms. In 2001, the number of observations in the initial FICUS file is 2 270 955. <lb/>The DADS data set <lb/>The DADS (Déclaration Annuelle de Données Sociales) comprises all records of <lb/>wages of all employees, as declared by employers to the tax authority. It is then compiled <lb/>into an exhaustive data set organized by pairs of years, by establishment and number of <lb/>workers within a given establishment. Hence, the year t file comprises all employees <lb/>within a given establishment for year t-1 and year t. When a worker is present in both <lb/>years in the establishment, there is a single line. When he/she is present in t-1, all year t <lb/>variables are missing, and conversely for year t. Viewed from a worker perspective, there <lb/>is a unique person identifier and, hence, it is possible to a have a comprehensive view of <lb/>each worker&apos;s employers and wages. The total wages given to any person are then <lb/>compared by the tax authority to the income declaration that each household has to file <lb/>every year. Starting from 2009, the declared wages are automatically inserted onto the <lb/>income declaration form by the tax authority, which is therefore pre-filled. Each <lb/>individual record includes the start date and the end date of the spell, the number of <lb/>hours, and the gross and the net earnings that accrued to the worker during the spell for <lb/>each of the two years t-1 and t. It also includes the skill level (3-or more often 2-digits <lb/>classification), sex and nationality of the worker. From this file, I performed an <lb/>aggregation at different levels. <lb/>First, the data are aggregated by establishment and year, for year t going from 1996 to <lb/>2003. It allows me to compute various measures of employment, weighted or not by <lb/>hours and days of work within each year. Second, the data are examined at the individual-<lb/>, establishment-, and year-level as follows. Establishments can be destroyed and created <lb/>with no change in economic activity when, in particular, they move from one location in a <lb/>locality to another location within the same locality. Hence, there is potentially too much <lb/>employment creation and destruction. To control for this process, I do the following. I <lb/>take all those workers within an establishment who move to another establishment either <lb/>of the same firm or from a different firm within the same locality. If the fraction of such <lb/>workers is &quot; large &quot; enough with respect to the establishment employment, then the new <lb/>establishment is further examined. First, it is checked that it was not in existence <lb/>previously. Similarly, it is checked that the old establishment does not exist afterwards. <lb/>Then, if they both belong to the same firm, the new establishment is &quot; connected &quot; to the <lb/>old one and it is treated as if there were no establishment creation or destruction. If these <lb/></body>

			<body>establishments do not belong to the same firm, then I checked whether it is a particular <lb/>establishment within the two firms that received a transfer of most workers. If not, then if <lb/>all establishments of the origin firm have &quot; most &quot; workers transferred to the same number <lb/>of establishments of the destination firm, and then it is considered that there is no <lb/>establishment creation or destruction. Using this procedure, I compute employment <lb/>(weighted by days) for each year between 1995 and 2004 at the establishment level. It is <lb/>then aggregated at the firm level, using all available establishments, once checked for <lb/>their true birth or death as described just above. In 2001, there are 2 039 199 <lb/>establishments from all industries for which we try to measure employment. <lb/>Matching of the three files <lb/>First, I match FICUS with the DADS file at the establishment level. In 2001, the <lb/>resulting data set has 2 100 438 observations. Then, the equivalent file for 2004 <lb/>(2 367 270 observations) is matched with that of 2001. Then, this matched file (2 806 116 <lb/>observations) is restricted to the manufacturing firms (excluding extractive industries) <lb/>with positive sales either in 2001 or in 2004. The file has now 241 702 observations <lb/>(establishments). However, some firms may well be absent from the DADS when they <lb/>have no salaried employees and still be in FICUS (with zero employees in both 2001 and <lb/>2004). These firms are also kept, resulting in a data set with 288 460 observations (again <lb/>establishments). These establishments are then aggregated at the firm level, resulting in <lb/>240 447 unique firms present in 2001, 2004 or both. These observations are now matched <lb/>with the customs data file to enter the trade activity. Since most firms do not trade (import <lb/>or export) in any of these years, we keep all firms from the previous match. For the period <lb/>1998-2001, the number of firms is 254 621 and for the period 1995-2001, the number of <lb/>firms is 261 056. <lb/>These files contain all relevant variables. However, measurement errors in the <lb/>variables of interest may well have slightly decreased the size of some of our analysis <lb/>files. We will see in what follows that the measurement error is indeed a serious issue <lb/>with no easy escape-strategy. <lb/>4. <lb/>Aggregate estimation results <lb/>In this section, I present estimates of equations that relate employment and trade <lb/>activity at the firm-level for French manufacturing firms. These equations are descriptive <lb/>and should be seen as descriptive with little causal interpretation offered. They must be <lb/>considered as the first stage of a more ambitious program, including the search for <lb/>potential instruments or, more probably, the estimation of a structural model for <lb/>exporting/importing firms with their associated consequences on employment. <lb/>Let me first describe the estimated relations. I compute the rate of growth as follows <lb/>(in the spirit of Davis and Haltiwanger, 1999). First, there are three sample periods: 1995-<lb/>1998, 1998-2001, and 2001-2004. Then, I define employment of firm i at the beginning <lb/>and at the end of each sample period as <lb/>B <lb/>i <lb/>L and <lb/>E <lb/>i <lb/>L . Average employment over the <lb/>period is defined as <lb/>2 <lb/>E <lb/>i <lb/>B <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>L <lb/>L <lb/>L <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>and I use it to compute employment growth in the <lb/>firm over the period: <lb/>EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004) – 15 <lb/>OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124 © OECD 2011 <lb/>i <lb/>B <lb/>i <lb/>E <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>L <lb/>L <lb/>L <lb/>L <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>To describe these data further, I apply a simple regression analysis to the set of all <lb/>(continuing, dead or newly born) firms. Again, I do not attach any causal interpretation to <lb/>my specification or results. More precisely, for each of my three sample periods, I <lb/>estimate the following simple first-difference regression: <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>Z <lb/>Tr <lb/>L <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>(1) <lb/>where i <lb/>L <lb/> is the employment growth rate for firm i during the sample period (defined as <lb/>before), <lb/>i <lb/>Tr <lb/> <lb/>is a vector of measures of trade growth at firm i (described just below), <lb/>i <lb/>Z <lb/> <lb/>is a vector of measures of economic shocks potentially affecting firm i (also <lb/>described just below), and i <lb/> is an i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) shock. <lb/>My vector of measures of internationalization includes the change in imports (or exports) <lb/>between the beginning and the end of the period as a fraction of sales. To control for <lb/>shocks that might have affected the firm, <lb/>i <lb/>Z <lb/> includes the growth rate of firm&apos;s total <lb/>sales (computed à la Davis and Haltiwanger), the change in the ratio of firm&apos;s goods <lb/>purchases to total sales, and the change in the ratio of firm&apos;s intermediates purchases to <lb/>total sales. The regression is weighted either by average employment i <lb/>L or by average <lb/>sales. Various robustness checks are estimated and presented. <lb/>The first and simplest specification, in which <lb/>i <lb/>Z <lb/> only includes total sales growth <lb/>rate, is presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the set of observations is restricted to those for <lb/>which the discrepancy between employment change between the beginning and the end <lb/>of the sample period as measured with FICUS and as measured with the DADS is <lb/> &quot; small &quot; . Here, &quot; small &quot; means 1 000 in absolute value. There are many potential reasons <lb/>for such differences. They have to be explored further. The set of such firms is quite <lb/>small (look at the number of observations at the bottom of Table 1 and at the bottom of <lb/>Table 5). There are less than a hundred firms in each sample period, but these firms are <lb/>potentially large at either the beginning or the end of each sample period. Hence, their <lb/>inclusion might affect the estimated results. This is something I will check later in the <lb/>text. <lb/>Table 1. Net job creation rate <lb/>Intercept <lb/>-0.058 <lb/>0.001 <lb/>-0.044 <lb/>0.001 <lb/>-0.040 <lb/>0.001 <lb/>Change in export intensity <lb/>-0.251 <lb/>0.017 <lb/>-0.035 <lb/>0.003 <lb/>-0.227 <lb/>0.016 <lb/>Change in import intensity <lb/>0.004 <lb/>0.003 <lb/>-0.025 <lb/>0.006 <lb/>0.049 <lb/>0.009 <lb/>Growth of sales <lb/>0.924 <lb/>0.001 <lb/>0.907 <lb/>0.001 <lb/>0.894 <lb/>0.001 <lb/>R-Square <lb/>Number of observations <lb/>1995-1998 <lb/>1998-2001 <lb/>2001-2004 <lb/>176 180 <lb/>0.8248 <lb/>180 055 <lb/>0.8329 <lb/>172 093 <lb/>0.8447 <lb/>Note: In this table and subsequent tables the first column under each time period represents coefficients and the second <lb/>represents standard errors. <lb/>The estimates of Table 1 show that employment essentially decreased in <lb/>manufacturing in each period (even though the variables are not cantered, their means are <lb/>very close to zero). They also show that sales go hand in hand with employment changes. <lb/>Finally, focusing on our main variables of interest, changes in export intensity (measured <lb/></body>

			<body>as a ratio of the change in the level of exports to average sales over the sample period) <lb/>has a depressing effect on employment, whereas the effect of changes in import intensity <lb/>appear to be small, but there is large variation. Again, there is no causal meaning that can <lb/>easily be attached to such results. For instance, firms might have decreased employment <lb/>and, therefore, reduced their costs in order to increase their exporting capacity. However, <lb/>controlling for changes in sales reduces the potential for such an interpretation. <lb/>Table 2 is similar in spirit to Table 1. Some firm variables are added to the regression <lb/>as control variables. Before discussing them, it must be noted that none of the previous <lb/>conclusions is altered. The variables that were added to the initial ones are measures of <lb/>changes in the reach of the firm. Because customs data allow me to know the destinations <lb/>and origins of the exports and imports, respectively, I can compute the changes in this <lb/>number of destinations and origins. Because customs data allow me to know the products <lb/>imported or exported, I can compute changes in quantities, with the underlying idea that <lb/>an increase in the number of imported products might be associated with substitution <lb/>effects, whereas an increase in the number of exported products might be associated with <lb/>an expansionary strategy. In fact, this presumption appears to be turned on its head. When <lb/>the number of exported products increases, the effect on employment in France is clearly <lb/>negative for all periods. Interestingly, the opposite phenomenon appears to be associated <lb/>with an increase in the number of products imported: more products imported are <lb/>associated with an increase in employment. As for the number of countries, increasing the <lb/>number of destinations is &quot; good &quot; for employment and increasing the number of sourcing <lb/>countries is &quot; good &quot; in two sub-periods. <lb/>Table 2.

By using the location of these <lb/>establishments, it is also possible to measure the change in geographic dispersion of the <lb/>firm within France. Results from Table 2 show that a larger number of permanent <lb/>(ongoing) establishments is always associated with employment losses. Similarly, an <lb/>increase in geographic dispersion across French establishments is associated with an <lb/>increase in employment. However, the effects of new openings and closures appear more <lb/>complex. First, the addition of a new establishment has a negative impact in two of the <lb/>three sub-periods. Second, the impact of the closure of an establishment has to be <lb/>computed from the sum of the &quot; closed establishments &quot; effect and the sum of changes in <lb/></body>

			<body>the number of establishments (applying a value of minus one). Hence, the effect of the <lb/>closure of one establishment is positive in 1995-1998, negative in 1998-2001, and <lb/>essentially zero in 2001-2004 (notice that 2001 is the starting date of a clear decrease in <lb/>manufacturing employment, as measured in aggregate statistics). The underlying impact <lb/>of globalisation on establishments&apos; operations is clearly hard to capture from these simple <lb/>regressions. <lb/>The next regressions test the robustness of those that I have just presented using <lb/>various strategies. First, I add two variables in the base equation to control for purchases <lb/>of the firm: the change in purchases of intermediates and the change in purchases of <lb/>goods (both as a ratio of total sales). Results are presented in Table 3. They clearly show <lb/>elements of consistency with the results from Biscourp and Kramarz (2007): goods play a <lb/>role that appears to widely differ from that played by intermediates. Purchases of goods, <lb/>including imports, destroy employment, whereas there is no such relation between <lb/>employment and purchases of intermediates. 7 <lb/>Table 4 presents results of regressions that use the same variables as in Table 3 but <lb/>with a different weighting scheme. Rather than using average employment in the period, I <lb/>use average sales in the period. Results are very similar to those presented above. The <lb/>coefficients on export-and import intensity are of the same sign. This is also true for the <lb/>coefficients for the change in the purchases of goods (still negative). <lb/>Table 5 uses again the same variables and the same weighting scheme, but includes <lb/>all observations; in particular those for which estimates of changes in employment <lb/>computed using the DADS and using FICUS were very different. The main message is <lb/>that export intensity is associated with employment losses, similarly to changes in the <lb/>purchases of goods. These points seem very robust across specifications and samples. <lb/>Table 6 adds a further twist to the previous specification by distinguishing imports <lb/>using the two product types, as defined above: imports of finished goods on one side <lb/>(when the imported product is of the same industry as that of the firm) and imports of <lb/>intermediates for all other products (see also Biscourp and Kramarz, 2010). In reading the <lb/>table, it is important to note that it reflects the separate, simultaneous inclusion of <lb/>purchases (including imports) of goods and intermediates. Notice first that most <lb/>coefficients in Table 6 are quite similar to those in Table 5. However, those that change <lb/>sign and magnitude are those of purchases and imports of intermediates. Results are not <lb/>stable from period to period. For the first sub-period, all purchases of goods, be they <lb/>imports or local, have a similar negative effect on employment. Purchases of <lb/>intermediates from France have a negative impact while purchases of intermediates from <lb/>outside France (the sum of the two coefficients) have an essentially zero effect. For the <lb/>1998-2001 sub-period, signs swap and magnitudes are altered. The imports of goods have <lb/>a greater, more negative, impact on employment than local purchases of goods. As for <lb/>intermediates, local purchases have a mildly positive impact on employment while <lb/>foreign purchases have a quite negative impact. Finally, for the later sub-period, local <lb/>purchases of goods and intermediates have a negative impact on employment growth, <lb/>whereas foreign purchases (imports) of goods and intermediates have a clearly positive <lb/>impact on employment. Finally, the impact of exports on employment growth is again <lb/>negative in each and every sub-period. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">7 <lb/>Unfortunately, at this stage, I did not have enough time to code the imports into intermediates and <lb/>goods as I did with Biscourp for the 1986-1992 period.

The industries analyzed <lb/>here are based on a classic decomposition of manufacturing industries. I use the following <lb/>list: automobile, consumption goods, equipment goods, intermediate goods, and agro-<lb/>industries. Except for the automobile industry, the number of firms (observations) is <lb/>relatively similar across sectors, even though the structure of these firms is quite different <lb/>(in terms of skill structure and capital stock, among other characteristics). <lb/>Estimates are presented in Table 7a to Table 7e. First, all these industries tend to lose <lb/>jobs. Second, in an overwhelming number of cases, growth of exports is associated with <lb/>employment losses (the only exception is automobile between 1995 and 1998). Finally, <lb/>there is no obvious regularity in the sign of the relationship between changes in imports <lb/>and job creation or destruction. <lb/>In a further analysis, I redid the regression with purchases included (as in Table 3 or <lb/>4), by industry. Results were quite similar to those shown in Tables 7a to 7e. In addition, <lb/>for most industries, but equipment goods, increased purchases of goods were associated <lb/>with decreased employment. However, in the equipment goods industry, increased <lb/>purchases of goods were clearly associated with increased employment, reflecting <lb/>potentially the nature of investment goods imported in this case. <lb/>Table 7a.

			<body>6. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This version of the paper has examined, in France, the relation between imports, and <lb/>trade more generally, and employment. There are some simple patterns in our findings <lb/>that appear to be stable. In most cases, the association between export growth and <lb/>employment creation does not go necessarily in the expected direction. Similarly, import <lb/>growth has effects on employment that vary with the period and the industry. Finally, the <lb/>most stable factor affecting employment negatively appears to be purchases of goods, <lb/>either from a French firm or from a foreign one. The estimates obtained when <lb/>distinguishing between imports of goods and imports of intermediates are reminiscent of <lb/>those of Biscourp and Kramarz (2007). Interestingly, the papers that have tried to <lb/>reproduce those results for other countries have not managed to find the same effect. <lb/>Hence, the present findings for the recent period together with those for the period from <lb/>1986 to 1992 in Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) vindicate those by Kramarz (2010), for <lb/>whom offshoring in France is a result of strong unions, a French specificity. <lb/>Is it possible to provide a &quot; unified &quot; interpretation for these results? Well, in France <lb/>manufacturing industries are characterized by the prevalence and overall strength of very <lb/>large firms, with a lack of what Germans call Mittelstand, i.e. middle-size firms. If we <lb/>adopt a life-cycle view of a firm, those firms that are large essentially tend to downsize <lb/>their operations in France and expand them abroad (at the same time exporting more <lb/>globally), in particular by producing more and more goods in countries other than France. <lb/>Indeed, they appear to be pushed to do this because of unions, if we believe Kramarz&apos;s <lb/>(2010) results. Now, smaller firms in France that aspire to grow have difficulties in <lb/>expanding in their home market. Many reasons may explain this: engineers and business <lb/>graduates (in general, alumni from the Grandes Ecoles system) going almost exclusively <lb/>to very large firms, lack of product market competition, state support to national <lb/>champions, high firing costs discouraging firms from growing and workers from moving <lb/>from firm to firm, among other factors. Hence, we may observe in the data a (somewhat <lb/>surprising) statistical association between export growth and employment decrease. The <lb/>observed estimates are driven mostly by the behaviour of large firms and their pattern of <lb/>export growth, as well as the employment stability of smaller firms who face difficulties <lb/>in expanding at home. All the above points must be explored further to understand more <lb/>fully the link between the trade and employment, at least in France. <lb/></body>
