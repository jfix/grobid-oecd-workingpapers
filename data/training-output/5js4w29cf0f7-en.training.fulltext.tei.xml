			<head>Executive Summary<lb/></head>

			<p> Two case studies are presented as examples of food loss and waste policy practices in Japan<lb/> and the United Kingdom. They have been prepared by the Government of Japan and<lb/> DEFRA and WRAP in the United Kingdom as a contribution to the OECD&apos;s ongoing work<lb/> on market and trade impacts of food loss and waste reduction.<lb/>  Japan is a major food importing country with trade accounting for about 60% of its food<lb/> intake. However, food loss and waste at each stage of the food chain is a serious concern.<lb/> The government has implemented policies to control and recycle food loss and waste since<lb/> 2000 under the Food Recycling Law. Section 1 summarises Japan&apos;s goals, measurements,<lb/> achievements and future challenges of its food loss and waste policies.<lb/>  In order to monitor these policies, data on food waste in Japan is collected from the food<lb/> manufacturing, wholesaling, retail and catering industries. It is a requirement that all<lb/> business operators with more than 100 tonnes of annual food waste generation report<lb/> annually the status of the generation and recycling of their food wastes. The estimates for<lb/> the entire country are calculated on the basis of those complying with the law, together with<lb/> a sample survey of business operators who generate 100 tonnes or less of waste. Data on<lb/> food waste in the food service industry and households is also collected through other<lb/> statistics. An interesting feature of Japanese statistics is that they estimate the amount that is<lb/> recycled for feed or fertiliser use.<lb/>  The government plans to target the amount of food waste that is to be reduced, and this is a<lb/> priority over reuse and recycling. Following a technical investigation, target value for the<lb/> control of food waste generation were established to cover 26 industry groups for a period<lb/> of five years from April 2014. The indicator &quot; reference generation unit &quot; is applied as the<lb/> target value for the control of food waste generation.<lb/>  Food waste resulting from returned goods and excess inventory is difficult for individual<lb/> companies to resolve and should be tackled by the entire food chain. In this regard, the food<lb/> industry in Japan has formed a working group to examine business customs in order to<lb/> reduce food waste and to review delivery deadlines, best before date use standards, and<lb/> labelling methods. These reviews are drawing attention particularly as the extension of<lb/> product expiration dates is expected to improve domestic stockpiles in case of disasters.<lb/>  The measures in Japan summarised in this paper seem effective but concern only the control<lb/> of waste generation and recycling of food waste in the food industry and do not cover food<lb/> loss occurring at the farm level. It should be noted that food waste at the consumer level has<lb/> shown no change in recent years. Looking over the entire food chain, future challenges for<lb/> food loss and waste at each stage of the food value chain are outlined.<lb/>  Preventing food waste has been a priority for Governments in the United Kingdom for over<lb/> a decade, and a range of mechanisms have been put in place to deliver this. Section 2<lb/> outlines the policy context within which food waste prevention sits, explains how food<lb/> waste is defined in the United Kingdom, provides detail on the level and types of food waste<lb/> across different sectors, and describes the interventions adopted and their impacts.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<table>Three major WRAP (The Waste and Resources Action Programme) studies carried out in<lb/> 2013 estimated annual food waste arising within households, hospitality and food service,<lb/> food manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors at around 12 Mt, 75% of which could have<lb/> been avoided. Around 90% (by weight) of the avoidable food waste arises in households<lb/> and food manufacture.<lb/>  The primary mechanisms in the United Kingdom for facilitating the reduction in food waste<lb/> are the Courtauld Commitment (CC) and Hospitality and Food Service Agreement<lb/></table>

			<p>(HaFSA), both voluntary agreements managed by WRAP, and funded by Westminster,<lb/> Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments, and the consumer facing Love Food<lb/> Hate Waste (LFHW) campaign. Based on the experience in the United Kingdom, the<lb/> following factors are highlighted as important for successfully reducing food waste:<lb/>  An evidence based strategy, to identify priorities, build a persuasive case for action,<lb/> develop clear and robust recommendations and inform the development of effective<lb/> messages and materials for engaging with consumers, industry and other stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<p> An integrated approach, looking across the whole supply chain (recognising the<lb/> influence those at any given stage in the supply chain can have on others in the supply<lb/> chain), and also in terms of householders incorporating three key elements (national /<lb/> large scale awareness raising campaigns, local/community engagement to influence<lb/> behaviours and changes to products, packaging and labelling to make it easier to buy<lb/> the right amounts of food and use what is bought), which if implemented together<lb/> deliver much more than any element in isolation.<lb/>  A framework for action, such as the CC and HaFSA, with collective targets which<lb/> provides a mechanism for sharing best practice and facilitating the uptake of<lb/> recommendations for change.<lb/>  Monitoring and reporting, to assess progress against targets, allow changes in action<lb/> to be made in response to this and to recognise (publically) achievements (show what<lb/> can be done) and benefits of taking action.<lb/>  The chapter concludes by exploring the challenges ahead and implications of reduced food<lb/> waste levels. While the United Kingdom has made positive progress in reducing food waste,<lb/> it is likely that further reduction will become increasingly challenging (for example as the<lb/> &quot; quick wins &quot; will have been achieved). Population growth and other economic factors will<lb/> also limit the reduction of food waste.<lb/></p>

			<head>FOOD LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION ACTIVITIES<lb/> IN JAPAN<lb/> 1.1.<lb/> Background<lb/></head>

			<p>Japan is a major food importing country, importing 60% of its food supply. The food self-<lb/>sufficiency rate on a calorie basis is among the lowest of OECD countries. However, Japan&apos;s<lb/> culinary culture highly values fresh food, such as sashimi and foods that are in season, and<lb/> this results an excessively freshness-conscious consumer base which, in turn, is thought to<lb/> result in considerable food loss and waste at each stage of the food chain. Since the Food<lb/> Recycling Law was enacted in 2000 under the joint jurisdiction of the Ministry of<lb/> Environment (MOE) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), the<lb/> government has introduced policies on the control and recycling of food loss and waste. The<lb/> motivation to fight food loss and waste in Japan is related to lower costs for both consumers<lb/> and producers, but also concerns for the global environment and solidarity with<lb/> underdeveloped nations (<ref type="biblio">Marra, 2013</ref>). The present study summarises Japan&apos;s goal setting,<lb/> measurements and achievements as well as the future challenges of its food loss and waste<lb/> policies.<lb/> This section provides an overview of the policies targeting waste in general. Since the<lb/> Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilities of Resources (Recycling Law) and the Basic<lb/> Environmental Law were enacted in 1991 and 1993, respectively, other environmental issues<lb/> have been dealt with separately; for example, by the revision of the Waste Disposal and<lb/> Public Cleansing Law. Nevertheless, a large amount of waste is still generated every year<lb/> which makes it difficult to ensure the waste disposal site, and complicates the waste<lb/> management with problems such as illegal dumping. In order to address such waste and<lb/> recycling problems, by moving away from an economy of &quot; mass production, mass<lb/> consumption and mass disposal &quot; and achieving a &quot; recycling society &quot; with low environmental<lb/> impacts, the Basic Law for Establishing the Recycling-Based Society was enacted. This law<lb/> provides the framework to promote the formation of a recycling-oriented society and was<lb/> enacted in June 2000 and fully enforced as of January 2001.<lb/> Comparison of international policy frameworks (<ref type="biblio">Sakai et al., 2011</ref>) indicates that the<lb/> major focus of waste management policies changed during the late 20 th and early&quot; thermal recovery &quot; and &quot; proper disposal. &quot; The concept of extended producer responsibility is<lb/> adopted in the law in the way that a producer assumes certain responsibilities for the disposal<lb/> and recycling of its products, as well as the state measures that define the implementation of<lb/> receipt of products after use, their recycling and the pre-evaluation of products.<lb/></p>

			<p>Various recycling laws were enacted together with the Basic Law, and revisions of the<lb/> Recycling Law and Waste Disposal and Public Cleansing Law were also undertaken<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Newly enacted laws were the Food Recycling Law, Construction Waste Recycling<lb/> Law, Containers and Packaging Recycling Law, Home Appliance Recycling Law, End-of-life<lb/> Vehicle Recycling Law, and the Law on Promoting Green Purchasing. In 2012, a Small<lb/> Electronic Appliance Recycling Law that covers mobile phones and game machines was also<lb/> enacted.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Waste Management framework in Japan<lb/> Source: Sakai et al. (2011).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Food Recycling Law addresses both the reduction of waste, such as processing<lb/> residues from food production, unsold or uneaten foods in the distribution and consumption<lb/> process, and recycling of waste materials to feed and fertiliser uses, etc. These laws are aimed<lb/> at creating a recycling-oriented society with low environmental impact as well as reducing the<lb/> amount of food waste. Food-related businesses in the manufacture, distribution and catering<lb/> sectors are obliged to recycle waste materials, and if their activities are deemed insufficient,<lb/> the government can issue instructions and recommendations, or even publish the name of the<lb/> company. Penalties can be imposed in case government instructions are not obeyed.<lb/> The Food Recycling Law defines food waste as follows:<lb/>  Food materials which are disposed after being served or without being served as food<lb/></p>

			<p>The scope of Japanese definition of food waste is different from FAO&apos;s and limited to<lb/> manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, caterer and consumer stage. It is assumed that non-edible<lb/> portions of food and by-products are included in Japanese definition of food waste.<lb/> The Food Recycling Law provides a registration system of recycling operators and a<lb/> certification system for business plans on recycling in order to promote recycling by food-<lb/>related businesses. This is the system where operators producing specific feeds and fertilisers<lb/> from recycled food materials can be registered by the Ministry; 180 operators were registered<lb/> nationwide as of March 2014. The registration identifies business operators who undertake<lb/> their recycling business according to government norms, with the goal of cultivating good<lb/> recycling companies. The registration requirements are that the production of feeds and<lb/> fertilisers do not hinder the conservation of the living environment, that the scale and type of<lb/> facilities are appropriate to efficiently implement the business (processing of food resources<lb/> of 5 tonnes or more per day), and that there is a sufficient financial basis for project<lb/> implementation. The advantages of registration are expanded business opportunities owing to<lb/> the publication of their company on a government website, special treatment under the Feed<lb/> Safety Law and Fertiliser Control Act that does not require repetitive notification of sales and<lb/> production of feed and fertiliser, and a special treatment under the Waste Disposal and Public<lb/> Cleansing Law that does not require a work permit for the transportation of municipal solid<lb/> waste in the unloading area (a work permit is required, however, from the municipality in the<lb/> loading area).<lb/> The certification system of a business plan on recycling, called &quot; recycling loop &quot; , that uses<lb/> specific feed and fertiliser from recycled food materials can be formulated jointly by<lb/> manufacturers and operators on agriculture, forestry and fishery industries, etc., as a specific<lb/> user, and receive recognition from the respective Ministries. Once the plan is approved, the<lb/> business plan will receive special treatment under the Feed Safety Law, Fertiliser Control Act,<lb/> and the Waste Disposal and Public Cleansing Law. Under this system, food-related businesses<lb/> can expect stable supplies of primary products from agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and<lb/> recycling businesses, and the primary sector may secure customers within the recycling loop.<lb/> In March 2014, there were 52 certified business plans on recycling, consisting of 20 livestock<lb/> feed businesses and 32 fertiliser businesses. For example, vegetables and pork are produced<lb/> using a fertiliser or feed that has been recycled from food. The Food Recycling Law must be<lb/> reviewed for its enforcement status five years after implementation, and take necessary<lb/> measures recommended by the review. In response to this, a committee composed of<lb/> representatives from the MOE and MAFF met in 2006, and the law was amended in 2007.<lb/> In order to monitor this policy, data on food waste is collected by the food manufacturing,<lb/> wholesaling, retail and catering industries. In response to the legislative changes in 2007, it is<lb/> necessary for the operators with more than 100 tonnes of annual food waste generation to<lb/> report annually the status of generation and recycling of their food wastes. The estimates of<lb/> food waste for the entire country are made from the responses together with a sample survey<lb/> for the operators of 100 tonnes or less. Data on food waste in the food service industry and<lb/> households is collected through other statistics, and the MOE also has other estimates of<lb/> household waste. An interesting feature in Japanese statistics is that it contains the amount<lb/> that is recycled for feed or fertilisers. Recent policies are monitored by these detailed<lb/> statistics, but in the past, the rough estimates of food waste were calculated by taking the<lb/> difference between the intake and the supply amount per capita per day on a calorie basis<lb/> (Box 1). <ref type="biblio">Stuart (2009)</ref> proposed to compare the required intake amount per capita for each<lb/> country and the supply amount obtained from FAO&apos;s food balance sheets. This enables simple<lb/> international comparison of excessive food intake and food waste. Such a method with the<lb/> data readily accessible would be helpful in countries that do not collect data specific to food<lb/> waste.<lb/> At the time of the revision of the Food Recycling Law in 2007, the following items were<lb/> revised in addition to the introduction of mandatory reporting of food waste generation:<lb/>  Additional recycling method.<lb/>  Additional treatment of food resources: heat recovery.<lb/>  Setting targets of recycling rate for each industry and reference targets for each<lb/> operators.<lb/>  Handling a franchise chain as a single integrated operator.<lb/>  Review of the certification system of business plans on recycling to facilitate efforts by<lb/> food-related businesses.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 1. One meal&apos;s worth of calories are lost between the supply and intake amounts in Japan<lb/></figure>

			<p>The calories supply per capita initially shows an increasing trend from 2 530 kcal in 1970 to 2 670 kcal in 1996, and then<lb/> a decline to 2 436 kcal in 2011 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). On the other hand, calorie intake per capita has decreased steadily since 1970 and<lb/> was 1 788 kcal in 2011. It is considered that the difference between the two figures provides a rough indication of inevitable<lb/> residues during the processing stage of the food industry and leftover foods at the household level, etc., and equates to<lb/> around 600 to 700 kcal, which is equivalent to one meal of a day.<lb/></p>

			<p>The remainder of this section notes a few key points about the situation of food waste<lb/> recycling. Although a reduction in generation of food waste has priority, other activities after<lb/> generation are also important. Food materials should be recycled as feed and fertiliser where<lb/> feasible, and only if recycling is difficult should heat recovery be carried out. In the case<lb/> where recycling and heat recovery are both impossible, the amount of waste should be<lb/> reduced by dewatering and drying. Such priority setting in Japan is in line with<lb/> recommendations such as those embodied in the &quot; toolkit &quot; by the FAO (2013).<lb/> In the practice of recycling, the amount, composition and potential demand of food waste<lb/> should be clearly understood in order to select the appropriate method of recycling. Discharge<lb/> of waste is properly separated from containers, packaging, tableware, and any other foreign<lb/> matter, e.g. toothpick and food waste that are not suitable for recycling. The livestock feed use<lb/> of waste is a means capable of recycling effectively calorie and ingredients, which contributes<lb/> to the improvement of feed self-sufficiency. It is important to select it preferentially when<lb/> performing recycling, while ensuring the safety of the feed. Fertiliser should be produced on<lb/> the premise to ensure its utilisation, by taking into account the quality needs of farmers and<lb/> the supply and demand situation of organic fertiliser in regional markets. The revision of the<lb/> law in 2007 added ethanol and hydrocarbon products to be used as fuel and a reducing agent<lb/> as recycling methods, in addition to feed, fertilisers, oils and fats, and methane.<lb/>  The revision has also added heat recovery as a treatment of food resources. However, it<lb/> is restricted to situations where recycling is difficult. There are two conditions where<lb/> heat recovery should be chosen.<lb/>  There is no manufacturing facility of specific feed and fertiliser in a range of 75 km, and<lb/> the nature and type of food waste is extremely difficult to recycle.<lb/>  Even if there is a manufacturing facility of specific feed and fertiliser within 75 km, it is<lb/> possible to recover energy equally or more efficiently than that of methane.<lb/></p>

			<p>The certification system of the business plan on recycling has been reviewed to include<lb/> additional requirements for certification where food-related operators are sure to accept<lb/> specific products of agriculture, livestock and fisheries which have been produced with<lb/> recycled feeds and fertilisers, to the amount stipulated by the ordinance of the Ministry. In<lb/> short, there is a need to complete the recycling loop that circulates food resources among the<lb/> three parties (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<p>More than a decade has passed since the Food Recycling Law was enacted and the<lb/> majority of food waste associated with business activities is now recycled in Japan. With<lb/> regard to the quantitative analysis in the OECD study of food waste and loss reduction<lb/> impacts on markets and trade, it should be noted that the materials that have been recycled as<lb/> a by-product will be counted as waste, and only the amount of reduction will be dealt with in<lb/> the study.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 2. Assessment of environmental impact of the food waste recycling in Japan<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Food Recycling Law in Japan promotes the &quot; recycling loop &quot; that requires food industries to<lb/> purchase farm products that are grown using food waste-derived compost/animal feed. One question is<lb/> whether these recycling loops are environmentally and economically effective.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Takata et al, (2012)</ref> applied the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) approach to<lb/> evaluate global warming potential and running cost of five looped facilities for machine integrated compost,<lb/> windrow compost, liquid feed, dry feed, and bio-gasification. The LCA results showed low total GHG<lb/> (greenhouse gas) emissions of − 126 and − 49 kg-CO2/t-waste, respectively, for dry feed and bio-<lb/>gasification facilities, due to a high substitution effect. The LCC study showed a low running cost for<lb/> composting facilities of – 15 648 and – 18 955 JPY/t-waste, respectively, due to high revenue from the food<lb/> waste collection.<lb/> It was found that mandatory reporting of food waste emitters to the government increased collection<lb/> fees; however, the collection fee from animal feed facilities was relatively low because food waste was<lb/> collected at a low price or nutritious food waste was purchased to produce quality feed. In the<lb/> characterisation survey of various treatment methods, the composting facilities showed a relatively low<lb/> environmental impact and a high economic efficiency.<lb/> Animal feed facilities had a wide distribution of the total GHG emissions, depending on both the energy<lb/> usage during the drying process and the substitution effect, which were related to the water content of the<lb/> food waste and the number of recycled products. In comparison with incineration, the majority of the food<lb/> recycling facilities showed low GHG emissions and economic effectiveness. The study also reported on the<lb/> effects of recycling loops by comparing looped and non-looped animal feed facilities, and confirmed that the<lb/> looped facilities were economically effective due to an increased amount of food waste collection.<lb/></p>

			<p>industry groups that dispose of edible parts of food due to over-production, over-storage<lb/> and product returns; the target levels have been tentatively set for a two year period starting<lb/> from April 2012. Since April 2014, these targets have been fully operational by widening the<lb/> coverage to 26 industry groups. They apply the &quot; reference generation unit &quot; indicator as the<lb/> target amount of food waste reduction. This indicator is the amount of food waste generated<lb/> divided by the indicator that closely relates to the amount of food waste, such as sales, and<lb/> production volumes and varies according to the type of business.<lb/> í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ =<lb/> í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±¡ í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¤í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí±. í µí±. í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±£í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±<lb/></p>

			<p>Tentative targets were developed first with operators that have high reference generation<lb/> units with less control of waste generation so as to contribute to a control of waste generation<lb/> throughout the entire industry, rather than to set up targets based on good track records of the<lb/> more progressive companies with low reference generation units. Specifically, the target<lb/> values were obtained by adding the standard deviation (set as 0.5 sigma) to a two-year<lb/> average of the reference generation unit of each industry. As a result, about 70% of all<lb/></p>

			<p>The parts of food which are edible but which are removed during the food manufacturing<lb/> process, e.g. breadcrumbs and poultry livers, can be reused as food by the development of<lb/> new products. However, it is time consuming and not easy to develop new products, and the<lb/> balance between the part of food used for manufacturing and other edible parts from<lb/> manufacturing does not necessarily meet demand. Thus the generation control of these parts is<lb/> difficult in the short timeframe. The method of setting the target value for the reduction<lb/> amount of food which is edible but inevitably removed during food manufacturing should be<lb/> treated with caution so that it does not put excessive constraints on industrial activities. Since<lb/> it is nevertheless desirable to control the occurrence of food waste which occurs during food<lb/> manufacturing, it is necessary to first quantify amounts of edible and inedible parts in order to<lb/> assess the possibility and methods to control these amounts.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, food waste that occurs as a result of transactions within the food<lb/> distribution industry, e.g. overproduction, excessive stocks, returned goods, can be reused<lb/> directly as food. Such food waste has scope for control through the review of business<lb/> customs, the improvement of more accurate orders, and the use of food banks. The methods<lb/> can be determined through discussion and various approaches are possible depending on the<lb/> scheme.<lb/></p>

			<head>(3) Considerations on target setting for food distribution (wholesale and retail) industry<lb/></head>

			<p>The recycling rates implemented by food wholesaling and food retailing reached 57% and<lb/> 41%, respectively, in 2011; both are below the target level established for 2012. The absolute<lb/> amount of food waste from food retailing is larger than that of food wholesaling (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/> Food waste from the retailing industry derive mainly from excessive stocks, damaged goods,<lb/> cooking wastes, and unsold goods which occur in the course of distribution, cooking and<lb/> sales. It is important to control these amounts as they are mostly edible; this will also<lb/> contribute to achieving the target recycling rate. A variety of control measures are possible;<lb/> for example, greater accuracy when ordering amounts of food products, the use of food banks,<lb/> consumer education. In addition, while food waste generated by returned goods and excess<lb/> inventory occurs throughout the food chain, the distribution industry should take the lead in<lb/> efforts to control such waste and spread the efforts to other participants in the food chain.<lb/></p>

			<p>When setting the target value, downstream industries such as retailing should go ahead of<lb/> others. In this case, it is necessary to avoid easy solutions that are restrained to just returning<lb/> the good to the upstream food manufacturing industry. The food waste generated from<lb/> wholesale agriculture, livestock and fisheries and fresh fish retailers, excluding the meat<lb/> wholesale industry, is characterised by a small amount of unsold or returned goods but a not<lb/> so negligible amount of internal organs of fish, preparation residue of vegetables and rice<lb/> bran, which is confronted with the same problem of food waste that inevitably occurs during<lb/> food manufacturing. Thus, it is necessary in the future to consider the possibility and methods<lb/> to control food waste by properly understanding the generation of food waste.<lb/></p>

			<head>(4) Considerations on target setting for catering industry<lb/></head>

			<p>The recycling rates implemented by the catering industry reached 23% in 2011, which is<lb/> below the target level set for 2012, and it indicates a large amount of food waste disposal<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Food waste from the catering industry is mainly composed of cooking waste and<lb/> uneaten foods which occur in the course of cooking, eating, drinking and sales. It is important<lb/> to control these amounts as they are mostly edible, and their recycling seems difficult to<lb/> progress because of contamination with foreign ingredients, salts and oils. Thus reducing<lb/> waste will be achieved by reducing the base amount. A variety of control measures are<lb/> possible, for example supply better reflecting sales volume, optimisation of cooking volume,<lb/> use of doggy bags for leftovers. Whatever the approach used, a basic understanding by<lb/> consumers is a prerequisite.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the review of 2014, business categories within the catering industry are diverse but in<lb/> order to reflect the manner of food waste generation well, target value setting has been done<lb/> by dividing the restaurant to smaller subgroups. Targets of other categories in catering<lb/> industry are in line with the current industry classification used in the mandatory reporting.<lb/></p>

			<head>(5) Industry groups for which target values cannot be established<lb/></head>

			<p>Following are the 14 industry groups, which will strive to control food waste generation<lb/> and to promote recycling in the meantime by voluntary efforts, with a view to setting their<lb/> target values in future. Their food waste is mostly inedible part that inevitably occurs during<lb/> food production, but quantification of edible and inedible parts of the food is insufficient, and<lb/> it will still be required to assess the possibility and methods to control these amounts.<lb/>  Meat parts and frozen meat manufacturing industry<lb/></p>

			<figure> Seaweed processing industry<lb/>  Manufacturing of salted goods and dried salted products<lb/>  Frozen marine products manufacturing<lb/>  Frozen aquatic food manufacturing industry<lb/>  Cane sugar manufacturing<lb/>  Miscellaneous grain-milling<lb/>  Tea industry<lb/>  Coffee manufacturing<lb/>  Fruit wine manufacturing industry<lb/>  Rice, barley and millet wholesaling<lb/>  Vegetables and fruit wholesaling<lb/>  Fresh seafood wholesaling<lb/>  Fresh fish retail<lb/></figure>

			<p>These industry groups manufacture or produce meat and fish products, grain-milling and<lb/> wholesaling of vegetables, and fresh fish. These commodities and the stages of the food<lb/> supply chains seem to correspond with the categories that show low figures in the food loss<lb/> and waste estimates to be used in the scenario analysis using the Aglink-Cosimo model. For<lb/> example, in the food loss and waste estimates, the processing and packaging, and distribution<lb/> stages of cereals in Europe and North America shows low figures of 0.5%-10% and 2%<lb/> respectively, and primary processing and storage stages of meat and seafood are lower than<lb/> 1%. These figures suggest it is more difficult to control food waste for these commodities and<lb/> industries in particular.<lb/></p>

			<p>It has been assumed that considerable discussion and technical assessments for each<lb/> industry groups were made by experts to establish the target value of waste reduction that can<lb/> be accepted by industries, academics and the government. The current target values do not<lb/> refer to the level of food waste that should be possible as the starting point. The concept is to<lb/> evaluate the current level of food waste as fairly as possible, and to start with a target that is<lb/> easy to tackle in view of the reality faced by industries.<lb/></p>

			<head>(6) Recent situation about the control of food waste<lb/></head>

			<p>This sub-section summarises how the control of food wastes has been progressing.<lb/> Currently, the data on the amount of food waste and the recycling rate are estimated using<lb/> statistical surveys and mandatory reporting under the Food Recycling Law. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows<lb/> the change in the amount of food waste generated by the food industry. There is a gap in the<lb/> data series between 2007 and 2008, and we will focus on the data since 2008. The food<lb/> industry has been regularly reducing food waste generation, especially in the food<lb/> manufacturing industry which accounts for most of food waste generation. The amount of<lb/> food waste declined from 20.9 Mt in 2010 to 19.96 Mt in 2011, which is about 4%, where the<lb/> share of food manufacturing industry is 83%. The food manufacturing industry and catering<lb/> (restaurants) show declines in the recent year, but the data on wholesalers do not change, and<lb/> the retailers show an increase of 7%.<lb/></p>

			<p>Considerations on target setting summarised in the last section reflect the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.<lb/> Food manufacturers, which show the largest amount of food waste generation and also most<lb/> of its reduction, have already achieved high rates of recycling and low rates of waste disposal.<lb/> Part of such efficiency may be due to the fact that most wastes from food manufacturers are<lb/> categorised as inedible or edible part of food loss that inevitably occurs during food<lb/> production, which are easier to control and less difficult to reduce the amount than other kinds<lb/> of food loss and waste.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Change in the amount of food waste generation in food industry in Japan<lb/> The gap in the data series between 2007 and 2008 is due to the introduction of mandatory<lb/> reporting for operators with more than 100 tonnes of food waste per year. In 2008, the<lb/> amounts reported by operators with more than 100 tonnes of food waste totalled more than the<lb/> amount calculated for 2008 based on the estimation methodology used up to 2007. There were<lb/> several reasons for this. For example, up to 2007, statistics were collected from the samples<lb/> hierarchically divided according to the number of employees without knowing the relative<lb/> 10.8<lb/> 4.3<lb/> 0.7<lb/> 2.3<lb/> 3.4<lb/> 11.3<lb/> 4.9<lb/> 0.7<lb/> 2.6<lb/> 3.1<lb/> 23.2<lb/> 18.6<lb/> 0.3<lb/> 1.3<lb/> 3<lb/> 22.7<lb/> 18.4<lb/> 0.3<lb/> 1.3<lb/> 2.7<lb/> 20.9<lb/> 17.2<lb/> 0.2<lb/> 1.2<lb/> 2.3<lb/> 20<lb/> 16.6<lb/> 0.2<lb/> 1.3<lb/> 1.9<lb/> 19.16<lb/> 15.8<lb/> 0.22<lb/> 1.22<lb/> 1.92<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> Total of food industry<lb/> Manufactures<lb/> Wholesalers<lb/> Retailers<lb/> Restaurants<lb/></figure>

			<p>Mt<lb/> FY2000 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010 FY2011 FY2012<lb/> distribution of food waste generation among the hierarchies. In addition, in the food<lb/> manufacturing industry which involves relatively large waste generations, the data of the<lb/> operators that generate a large amount of waste were not sufficiently obtained in the statistical<lb/> survey before 2008. This provided a general lesson in conducting sample surveys, but since<lb/> then, estimates are made only for operators with less than 100 tonnes of food waste, these are<lb/> then combined with the results of periodic reporting introduced by revised Food Recycling<lb/> Law, which improved the estimation methods and has produced figures closer to reality.<lb/></p>

			<head>(7) Statistics for consumers and catering industries<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to policy measures and statistics for the food industry, MAFF (2013a)<lb/> conducts statistical surveys on the food waste occurring in household consumption and<lb/> catering (restaurants). This amount of waste represents discarded food, including outdated<lb/> foodstuff and ready-to-eat food, edible portion removed by the decay during preparation and<lb/> table leftovers. Since the scope food loss concerned in the household survey is intended to be<lb/> the inner number of net food supply and demand of the Food Balance Sheet, the following<lb/> components are not included.<lb/>  The amount that has been directed to feed, etc.<lb/></p>

			<p> Depletion during storage, transport, warehouse, and point-of-sale.<lb/></p>

			<figure> Inedible parts of food such as fish bones and vegetable waste.<lb/> One question may be how the survey distinguishes the inedible parts from that which is<lb/> discarded as food waste. The survey uses the discard rate prescribed by the Ministry of<lb/> Education in the &quot; Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan. &quot; For example, if radish<lb/> skins are peeled too thick and the amount exceeds the discard rate for radishes as set forth by<lb/> the Standard <ref type="table">Table,</ref> the difference will be counted as food waste and the amount<lb/> corresponding to the discard rate will be considered as inedible.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the amount of food usage and food waste per person per day. Fruits<lb/> (8.9%), vegetables (8.7%), and seafood (6.0%) account for higher rates of waste than other<lb/> commodity groups. The overall rate of food loss is 3.7% in 2009. A comparison with other<lb/> industrialised regions for the food waste at the consumption stage (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) shows the low<lb/> rates that appear in the Japanese survey. Large differences in staple foods may relate not only<lb/> to the data collection methodology, but also to the fact that food supply per person in Japan is<lb/> one of the lowest among industrialized countries and eating portions are generally small, as<lb/> observed by Stuart (2009). Childhood education on food consumption where leftover is<lb/> considered wasteful (Mottainai) may partly explain these effects.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. The amount of food usage and food waste per person per day in Japan in 2009<lb/> Source: MAFF.<lb/> This statistical survey also shows the rate of food waste classified by the structure of<lb/> household members and the age of the dietary manager of the household. In terms of<lb/> household member structure, two-person households (4.2%) and single-person households<lb/> (4.8%) are beginning to show higher food waste than the households of three or more people<lb/> (3.4%). The households with an elderly dietary manager show more food waste than those<lb/> with a younger dietary manager, and the rate increases when the age classification goes from<lb/> over 50 to over 60 years old. Changes in the aging Japanese society, such as the increase in<lb/> single-person households, seem to impact the issue of food waste negatively.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In this survey, the degree of food freshness has been cited the most frequently as the<lb/> reason for direct disposal of food and foodstuff. Other reasons, such as the expiration of use<lb/> by date and best before date, come after that concerning freshness. These survey results may<lb/> be due to insufficient understanding of date labelling method, as we can see that the best<lb/> before date is taken as a reason to discard foods as well as the use by date. Since the time<lb/> series data on food waste by the survey shows no major change in the trend at the household<lb/> level (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), it seems that existing policies are more effective in impacting the food<lb/> industry.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.<lb/> Reasons and countermeasures against food loss and waste<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to promote the control of the generation of food waste, it is necessary to propose<lb/> feasible and effective measures by understanding the cause and occurrence of food waste. For<lb/> example, whereas in the upstream side and food manufacturing industry foods have been<lb/> discarded without being shipped as a result of excessive production to avoid shortage, the<lb/> industries in direct contact with consumers, such as retailing, tend to focus on freshness of<lb/> products, constant replenishment, and enhancing the store shelves in order to avoid a bad<lb/> reputation due to shortages and service degradation. Such business behaviour on the<lb/> presumption of consumer needs is considered to be a major factor of food loss and waste in<lb/> the food industry.<lb/> Japan&apos;s Organics Recycling Association reported in detail the causes of food loss and<lb/> waste in 2011 as a result of interview surveys on the occurrence of food loss and waste. The<lb/> report summarises the causes by types of food industry, such as manufacturing, wholesaling<lb/> and retailing, and by types of foods such as ready-made, daily delivered goods, frozen, canned<lb/> and retort food. It also analysed the causes of food waste associated to particular business<lb/> customs and which are useful to refer to when examining individual measures against food<lb/> loss and waste.</p>

			<head>(1) Working team to examine business customs to reduce food waste<lb/></head>

			<p>Food waste resulting from returned goods and excess inventory that involves business<lb/> counterparts is difficult for individual companies to resolve, and this should be tackled by the<lb/> entire food chain. In this regard, the food industry in Japan has installed a &quot; working team to<lb/> examine business customs to reduce food waste &quot; as a means for discussion among<lb/> manufacturing, wholesale and retail industries. The government is supporting the secretariat<lb/> to promote the initiative. The team of 18 people announced their interim report for the food<lb/> waste reduction in March 2013. Their results of survey on returned goods and disposal of<lb/> processed food revealed the followings. Causes of returned goods are soiled and damaged<lb/> products, expiration of delivery or sales dates and replacements for new products, etc.<lb/>  The rate of disposal without shipment is high in beverages and confectionery.<lb/></p>

			<p> Causes of disposal without shipment are low prediction accuracy of shipment and<lb/> expiration of delivery date, etc.<lb/>  Expiratory date of delivery is often set as the one-third of the period set as best before<lb/> date.<lb/></p>

			<p>The working team is expected to deal with a pilot project to review expiratory dates of<lb/> delivery and extension and labelling method of best before date in particular.<lb/></p>

			<head>(2) Pilot project to review expiratory date of deliver<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the business customs between food manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers is<lb/> called the &quot; one-third rule. &quot; According to this rule, retailers divide the period from the date of<lb/> manufacture to the best before date into roughly three equal parts, and apply them as the<lb/> period for the products to be delivered from manufacturers or wholesalers and as the period<lb/> for the products to be sold to consumers. For example in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, for a product with a best<lb/> before date of six months, retailers will reject or return the products which have passed two<lb/> months since the date of manufacture to their manufacturers or wholesalers. For the products<lb/> which have passed four months since the date of manufacture and with less than one-third of<lb/> their best before dates remaining, retailers will remove them from the shop front, discard them<lb/> or sell them at a discounted price.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the one-third rule retailers can secure more than one-third of the best before dates<lb/> for any goods to be sold at the store. This business custom in Japan applies stricter standards<lb/> of freshness compared with other countries. For example, the deadline for product delivery in<lb/> the United States is set as half of the best before dates, and in the case of European countries<lb/> it is two-thirds of the best before dates. Naturally, this business custom will be a cause of food<lb/> waste with returned or rejected products.<lb/> A cooperation council consisting of 43 companies of food manufacturing, wholesaling<lb/> and retailers estimated the amount of returned processed foods from wholesalers to food<lb/> manufacturers to be JPY 113.9 billion a year based on the value of manufacturer shipment in<lb/> the fiscal year 2010. The expiration of delivery date accounts for more than one-third of the<lb/> reasons for returned goods. The removal of products from the shelf due to the launch of new<lb/> products also accounts for more than one-third of reasons for returned goods. On the other<lb/> hand, returned products from retailers to wholesalers amount to JPY 41.7 billion, for reasons<lb/> such as the expiration of sell-by date prescribed by the one-third rule. Another study by the<lb/> working team to examine business customs to reduce food waste with 16 companies<lb/> participating, 74% of the products returned to the manufacturer are discarded, and the amount<lb/> of resale through other channels such as discount stores was a mere 16%.<lb/></p>

			<p>The causes for returned good and unshipped disposal are complex as they include<lb/> damage, spoilage, product replacement and inaccuracy of prediction for delivery amount, but<lb/> one important cause is considered to be the delivery deadline established through negotiations<lb/> between companies and set as the custom. A pilot project has been implemented in<lb/> cooperation with industry associations to relieve the delivery deadline, beginning from the<lb/> items which may be easier to obtain the consensus among participants. In cooperation with<lb/> the MAFF and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, participants from food and<lb/> beverage manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers will extend the delivery deadline to<lb/> retailers from one-third period to the half of the best before dates. The project will then<lb/> examine how this affects the goods at the retail level, product inventory of delivery<lb/> expiration, returned and discarded goods at dedicated logistic centres, simulation of unshipped<lb/> discards at manufacturers, and undertake surveys on consumer purchasing intentions. The<lb/> pilot project began in August 2013 and published the final results in March 2014, which<lb/> includes the estimated potential to reduce waste from drink and confectionary with more than<lb/> 180 days of best before dates by 40 000 tonnes per year.<lb/></p>

			<head>(3) Review of extension and labelling method of best before date<lb/></head>

			<p>In recent years, technology developments have been made to maintain the quality of the<lb/> product longer through improvements in productivity and sanitation during the food<lb/> manufacturing process and the development of packaging materials to allow for longer shelf<lb/> life. However, it is believed that revising the expiration date was not necessarily performed<lb/> alongside such technological development, and existing expiratory dates may not reflect the<lb/> current situation correctly. For this reason, the food manufacturing industry is verifying best<lb/> before dates of existing products based on scientific knowledge from the viewpoint of food<lb/> waste reduction. It will include the review of guidelines, manuals and safety indicators by<lb/> industry groups on setting the best before dates. Based on the results obtained, the industry is<lb/> supposed to address the extension of best before dates, while gaining the understanding by<lb/> consumers.<lb/> As for the review of labelling methods, the items with a long shelf-life have a lower speed<lb/> of quality degradation and it is less meaningful to manage them by date rather than month at<lb/> the consumption stage; the delivery of these by date order at the distribution stage may lead to<lb/> the occurrence of food waste. Since items of more than three months of shelf-life are already<lb/> allowed to display the best before date with month and year only, companies are expected to<lb/> devise existing labelling methods for the items with long shelf-life, including the change to<lb/> month/year labelling, to be understood by consumers without difficulty.<lb/> For example, the cooperative organisation of small and medium-sized supermarkets<lb/> called CGC Japan has been asking industry groups and manufacturers to review and extend<lb/> the shelf-life, but it is very time consuming and burdensome to realise in practice. Thus CGC<lb/> Japan has started to review the expiration dates of its own private-brand products, and they<lb/> assumed that the shelf-life of canned products can be as long as ten years without problem,<lb/> whereas it is usually set as three years after manufacture. In cooperation with a leading food<lb/> manufacturer, some of their private-brand products such as boiled mackerel were proved to<lb/> have no problem by sensory tests, and their expiration dates have been extended from three to<lb/> four years. The extension of best before date from two to three years was done for bottled<lb/> water, and the extension from one and half year to two years for packed rice cakes. These<lb/> reviews were thought to be urgent especially after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011,<lb/> as water, canned products and rice cakes are identified to make it more possible to spend the<lb/> interim refuge. They are focused on the extension of best before dates of product that can be<lb/> used as stored meal in order to increase the domestic stockpile against disasters. CGC Japan<lb/> also argues that the extension of the best before dates based on scientific evidence is directly<lb/> linked to the cost reduction of food manufacturers. In another example in 2014, the best<lb/> before dates of instant noodles in cups and sachets have been extended according to the<lb/> guideline set by an industry organization for instant foods.<lb/></p>

			<p>Unshipped disposal that occurs even after these reviews of business customs should be<lb/> addressed by the food bank or the society-wide efforts to reduce food waste. In Japan, active<lb/> recycling activities are targeting food wastes that are still generated despite these initiatives to<lb/> reduce them.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4.<lb/> Future prospects<lb/></head>

			<p>In October 2014, in response to the discussions between experts in the Joint Committee,<lb/> MAFF and MOE produced the future orientation of the food recycling system. In view of the<lb/> review and inspection of the implementation of the Food Recycling Law every five years,<lb/> they have been continuing the debate since then. In addition to voluntary efforts such as the<lb/> extension of best before dates by food industries and the full-scale implementation of target<lb/> setting on the control of food waste generation described above, strengthening cooperation<lb/> amongst local governments, food industries and recycling businesses has also been explored<lb/> as a future focus.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, the measures in Japan summarised in this paper seem effective but<lb/> concerned only generation control and the recycling of food waste in the food industry. It<lb/> does not cover food loss occurring at the farm level. It is noted that the amount of food waste<lb/> at the consumer stage has not shown any change in recent years. The government has started<lb/> to reinforce the campaign targeting consumers in 2013 to reduce food waste, called &quot; NO-<lb/>FOODLOSS PROJECT &quot; , and statistical surveys on food waste occurring at the household<lb/> consumption and catering (restaurants) levels will be implemented for the first time since<lb/> 2009. Looking over the entire food chain, the future challenges against food loss and waste at<lb/> consumer stage of food chain are clearly evident.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Preventing food waste in the</head>

			<table>United Kingdom:<lb/> A UK case study<lb/> 2.1.<lb/> Policy context<lb/> In 2000, households, commerce and industry in England and Wales generated 106 Mt of<lb/> waste a year, 83% of which went to landfill; the average municipal composting and recycling<lb/> rate was just 9%. That year, the Governments of England and Wales published Waste Strategy<lb/> 2000 for England and Wales, calling</table>

			<figure>for a tripling of municipal composting and recycling<lb/> rates, and an 85% reduction in the amount of commercial and industrial waste sent to landfill,<lb/> both by 2015. At the time, household waste was growing at 3% a year. As a result, the United<lb/> Kingdom has adopted a range of approaches to tackle food waste and between 2007 and 2012<lb/> household food waste decreased by 15% which equates to an estimated 1.3 Mt reduction in<lb/> food waste over a five year period. New data on historical changes and a scenario analysis of<lb/> what may be achievable in the future suggests that between 2015 and 2025 around 20 Mt of<lb/> food waste could be prevented in the United Kingdom (WRAP, 2014d).<lb/></figure>

			<p>While there is an economic, social and environmental rationale to tackle food waste, there<lb/> are barriers that have prevented businesses and households taking action to tackle this, such as<lb/> lack of awareness and information, and lack of fora for businesses to safely share best<lb/> practice. For this reason there has been a requirement for government intervention, which has<lb/> primarily been delivered through WRAP (The Waste and Resources Action Programme 1 ).<lb/> Although good progress has been made in the United Kingdom, approximately 15 Mt of food<lb/> and drink are still wasted each year, a loss to the economy and a cost to the environment.<lb/> Around half of this is from households (7 Mt), of which 60% is avoidable (i.e. could have<lb/> been consumed, rather than being inedible such as bones, tea bags, etc.). UK householders<lb/> spend GBP 12.5 billion every year on food that could have been eaten but ends up being<lb/> thrown away. Food and packaging waste also costs business money. Food waste and<lb/> packaging waste in the UK food supply chain is estimated at GBP 6.9 billion a year (WRAP,<lb/> 2013a), which is equivalent to more than 10% of GVA (which was GBP 52 billion for 2012).<lb/> There are wider environmental implications when food is wasted, such as around 20 Mt of<lb/> CO 2 e a year and many billions of tonnes of water, the majority of which is associated with the<lb/> production, transport and packaging of food rather than its disposal. Accordingly, food waste<lb/> was one of the priority waste streams under the Waste Prevention Programme for England<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Defra, 2011a; updated in Defra, 2013a</ref>).<lb/> Tackling food waste provides economic benefits for both business and households.<lb/> Households can save the money previously spent on wasted food or use it to purchase other<lb/> goods. For businesses reducing waste helps to support a sustainable, competitive sector,<lb/> where improved profitability can come from reducing costs associated with waste.<lb/> There will always be some unavoidable food waste, such as meat bones or peelings, and<lb/> this waste should be directed into the appropriate treatment, such as anaerobic digestion (AD)<lb/> or composting. Waste treated by AD can produce biomethane, a renewable energy source,<lb/> which in turn can be used to generate electricity, heat, be injected directly into the gas grid or<lb/> used as a transport fuel.<lb/></p>

			<p>Growth in this part of the Waste Management sector is being stimulated in the United<lb/> Kingdom by the Government&apos;s Anaerobic Digestion Strategy and Action Plan (Defra, 2011b).<lb/> There has been significant growth in the AD sector over the last two years, with the number<lb/> of plants rising from 54 when the AD Strategy was published to 115 currently. Much of this<lb/> growth has been in plants treating food waste. There continues to be good progress in<lb/> implementing the AD Action Plan (Defra, 2013b).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.<lb/> Definition of food waste<lb/></head>

			<p>The most commonly adopted specific definition of food 2 waste is that of the FAO (FAO,<lb/> 2011), which distinguishes between food losses, which occur as the result of &apos;unintentional&apos;<lb/> events and food waste, which occurs more through conscious action or &apos;negligence&apos;. This<lb/> definition only applies to the edible portions of food. There is currently much discussion<lb/> about how best to define food waste, for example the EC-funded FUSIONS project has an<lb/> objective to review available evidence and propose a standard approach on system boundaries<lb/> and the definition of food waste 3 (and see <ref type="biblio">Östergren et al. (2014)</ref> and a recent UK House of<lb/> Lords Inquiry into food waste received evidence from a wide variety of sources on this topic<lb/> (UK House of Lords European Union Committee (2014). The World Resources Institute<lb/> (WRI), in collaboration with UNEP, FAO, WRAP and FUSIONS, will be designing a global<lb/> standard for measuring food waste (the &quot; Food Loss and Waste Protocol &quot; ), which will also aim<lb/> to define the possible components of food loss and waste 4 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to facilitate its work on food waste prevention and management WRAP has<lb/> proposed a simple definition of food waste 5 , which is:<lb/> Food waste is any food that had the potential to be eaten, together with any<lb/> unavoidable waste, which is lost from the human food supply chain, at any point along<lb/> that chain.<lb/></p>

			<p>This definition covers:<lb/>  Only food produced for human consumption;<lb/></p>

			<p> All food and drink types, all disposal routes, and all sectors of the supply chain; and<lb/>  Both avoidable (edible) and unavoidable (inedible) food waste.<lb/> This definition does not include:<lb/>  Food/food surplus used as animal feed because this is not viewed as &apos;leaving the human food<lb/> supply chain&apos;, and therefore is not considered to be waste, but rather prevents material from<lb/> becoming waste.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> In this paper, &quot; food waste &quot; is used as shorthand for &quot; food and drink waste. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<table>3.<lb/> See http://eu-fusions.org/news/making-progress-towards-defining-food-waste.<lb/> 4.<lb/> http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/global-food-loss-and-waste-measurement-protocol.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The European Commission has proposed a definition of food waste, consistent with both the WRAP and<lb/> FUSIONS definitions, see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-<lb/>content/EN/TXT/DOC/?uri=CELEX:52014PC0397&amp;from=EN.<lb/></table>

			<p>Understanding all fractions of food waste is important when considering both prevention<lb/> and optimal treatment of waste. The classification of avoidable (edible) vs. unavoidable<lb/> (inedible) may vary with culture, and steps can be taken to influence both avoidable and<lb/> unavoidable waste, through changes in the types of food bought (for example households<lb/> purchasing more prepared foods, better trimmed fresh produce, chicken breasts vs whole<lb/> chickens – ensuring that greater benefit is gained from the unavoidable fractions in the supply<lb/> chain [soups, stocks, etc.).<lb/> Unavoidable waste is however much more likely to be affected (and increase) as a result<lb/> of an increasing population (the UK population is forecast to grow by 6 million by 2025, a<lb/> 10% increase (UK ONS, 2014).<lb/></p>

			<p>There is broad agreement that the following are the most important factors to quantify, in<lb/> terms of the amounts arising and their fate, from which clear comparisons can be made<lb/> between the factors on which those interrogating the data wish to focus, and to have strategies<lb/> in place to minimise the economic and environmental impact of:<lb/>  Total food waste (food made to be consumed by humans but which ends up not being so).<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Both avoidable and unavoidable fractions (the classification of which may vary).<lb/>  Food and related materials (including by-products) used as animal feed.<lb/>  Other by-products arising from the food supply chain.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A focus on practical and robust approaches to quantify the above is as, if not more<lb/> important than gaining agreement on the definition of food waste.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.<lb/> Food waste arising in the United Kingdom<lb/></head>

			<p>Three major WRAP studies carried out in 2013 estimated annual food waste arising<lb/> within households, hospitality and food service, food manufacture, retail and wholesale<lb/> sectors at around 12 Mt (<ref type="biblio">WRAP 2013a, 2013b, 2013c</ref>), 75% of which could have been<lb/> avoided. This had a value of over GBP 19 billion a year, and was associated with at least 20<lb/> Mt of greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2 equivalents). Around 90% (by weight) of the avoidable<lb/> food waste arises in households and food manufacture, although waste arising in one part of<lb/> the supply chain is certainly influenced by other parts of the chain.<lb/></p>

			<p>The focus of work has been on households, hospitality and food service, food<lb/> manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors. It has also been estimated that 3.0 Mt of food waste<lb/> arises from other sectors (WRAP, 2014a). This includes estimates for other food thrown away<lb/> by consumers out of home (e.g. from home-made lunches at work, as litter, in litter bins) and<lb/> the pre-factory gate stages of the food supply chain. Existing estimates of agricultural food<lb/> wastage are indicative, and based on a synthesis of evidence available at that time<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Environment Agency, 2004</ref>), and may include food losses as a result of weather, for<lb/> example. Food waste and losses arising in agriculture has not been an area of focus for<lb/> WRAP. However, going forward, it will be looking at ways to improve resource efficiency<lb/> and deliver financial savings throughout the whole supply chain, which would include<lb/> understanding more about food waste on farm.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The breakdown of this 15 Mt of food waste is illustrated in Figure 7 and Annex 2.A. In<lb/> comparison around 43 Mt of food are purchased in the United Kingdom (Defra 2013c;<lb/> WRAP, 2013d) (the majority for in home use), meaning that the amount of food wasted<lb/> throughout the supply chain is equivalent to around a third of that purchased. In addition to<lb/> food waste there are also 2.2 Mt of food or food by-products from food manufacturing used as<lb/> animal feed, and another 2 Mt of animal by-products sent to rendering plants. Annexes 2.B<lb/> and 2C illustrate the &apos;food loop&apos; in the United Kingdom, and the initiatives directed at<lb/> reducing food waste around the loop. This updated, detailed evidence base will allow<lb/> Governments, WRAP and its partners to make strategic decisions regarding the prevention,<lb/> collection and treatment of food waste. It will enable the approaches and materials aimed at<lb/> delivering this to be refreshed and targeted, bringing benefits to individuals, communities,<lb/> businesses and the United Kingdom as a whole.<lb/> Figure 7.

			<head>(1) Household food waste (see WRAP 2013b for more detail)<lb/></head>

			<p>The 7.0 Mt of food and drink waste thrown away from households in 2012 is enough to<lb/> fill Wembley Stadium in the United Kingdom nine times over, and represents 19%, by<lb/> weight, of food and drink brought into the home. Of this total:<lb/>  4.2 Mt (or 60% of the total) is avoidable, worth GBP 12.5 billion. This avoidable waste<lb/> is food and drink that would have been edible at some point prior to being thrown away,<lb/> for example slices of bread, apples, yoghurts, etc. This is equivalent to the average<lb/> household throwing away six meals per week, and is equivalent to 12% of the weight of<lb/> edible food and drink brought into the home.<lb/>  1.2 Mt (17% of the total) was considered &apos;possibly avoidable&apos;. This includes bread crusts<lb/> and potato peelings that some people eat but others do not.<lb/>  1.6 Mt (23% of the total) was unavoidable waste. Five types of waste made up 60% of<lb/> this (tea waste, banana skins, poultry bones, onion skins and orange peel).<lb/> Two-thirds (4.7 Mt) of household food and drink waste was collected by local authorities.<lb/> Of this, most was collected in kerbside &apos;residual&apos; or general waste, although more than half a<lb/> Mt (around 11% of that collected) was in targeted collections of food waste, meaning it could<lb/> be treated to generate energy and useful digestate or compost. Around a fifth was disposed of<lb/> via the sewer (1.6 Mt; the kitchen sink and other drains), with drinks and dairy products<lb/> making up more than half of this. The remainder was either composted at home (0.51 Mt) or<lb/> fed to animals (0.28 Mt).<lb/> For the average household, the price of the avoidable food and drink waste was around<lb/> GBP 470 per year, and therefore, avoidable food and drink waste accounted for approximately<lb/> 14% of the shopping budget.<lb/> The higher the number of people in a household, the greater the amount of food waste<lb/> generated, although the increase was not proportional, i.e. an average four-person household<lb/> wastes less than four times the average single-occupancy household. One-person households<lb/> threw away, on average, over 40% more avoidable food and drink waste than the overall<lb/> amount per person in the United Kingdom, worth GBP 290 a year compared to the UK<lb/> average of GBP 200 per person.<lb/> By weight (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>), the largest contributions to avoidable food waste were from:<lb/>  Fresh vegetables and salads (19%; 810,000 tonnes).<lb/></p>

			<figure> Drink (17%; 710,000 tonnes).<lb/>  Bakery (11%; 450,000 tonnes).<lb/>  Home-made and pre-prepared meals (10%; 440,000 tonnes).<lb/>  Dairy and eggs (10%; 420,000 tonnes).<lb/> By cost, the largest food groups wasted were:<lb/>  Meat and fish (17%; GBP 2.1 billion).<lb/>  Home-made and pre-prepared meals (17%; GBP 2.1 billion).<lb/>  Fresh vegetables and salad (14%; GBP 1.7 billion).<lb/>  Drink (10%; GBP 1.3 billion).<lb/>  Fresh fruit (7%; GBP 900 million).<lb/> Figure 8.

			<p>Fresh fruit, vegetable and salads combined, amounted to 1.2 Mt, worth GBP 2.6 billion,<lb/> and more than 13 billion &quot; 5 a day &quot; portions of fruit and vegetables were thrown away in<lb/> 2012, 6 enough to provide more than 7 million people with their &quot; 5 a day &quot; for a year.<lb/></p>

			<p>The greenhouse gas emissions associated with avoidable food and drink waste from UK<lb/> homes accounted for approximately 17 Mt of CO 2 equivalent (including contributions from<lb/> growing, manufacturing, packaging, transporting and disposing of the waste).. The carbon<lb/> saving of preventing all avoidable food waste in 2012 is equivalent to taking one in four cars<lb/> off UK roads.<lb/> Land is required to produce food and drink that is subsequently thrown away by UK<lb/> households. For the first time, an estimate has been made of these land requirements: 19 000<lb/> square kilometres or an area about 91% the size of Wales.<lb/> Just under half of avoidable food and drink waste (worth GBP 5.6 billion) was classified<lb/> as &quot; not used in time: &quot; thrown away because it had either gone off or passed the date on the<lb/> packaging (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). This included large amounts of bread, milk and fresh potatoes. A<lb/> further 31% (worth GBP 4.1 billion) was classified as &quot; cooked, prepared or served too much: &quot;<lb/> this included food and drink that had been left over after preparation or serving, such as<lb/> carbonated soft drinks, home-made and pre-prepared meals, and cooked potatoes.<lb/> Approximately 80% of food and drink is wasted because it either wasn&apos;t used in time, or too<lb/> much was cooked, prepared or served, so addressing these issues will deliver the greatest<lb/> benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>The remaining reasons are linked to personal preferences including health reasons and not<lb/> liking certain foods (GBP 1.9 billion), and accidents, including &quot; food dropped on the floor &quot;<lb/> and &quot; failure of a freezer &quot; (GBP 560 million). A new report (WRAP, 2014e) further explores<lb/> the relationship between the level of avoidable food and drink waste from households, factors<lb/> including socio-demographics, and behaviours relating to food, such as healthy eating and<lb/> time available for food-related activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reasons for disposal vary considerably by food group. For the following categories,<lb/> most was wasted because it was not used in time: fresh vegetables and salads, bakery, dairy<lb/> and eggs, and fruit. For example, avoidable fresh vegetable and salad wasted because it was<lb/> not used in time cost GBP 1.1 billion, approximately two-thirds of the total cost of fresh<lb/> vegetables and salads thrown away. In contrast, drinks and meal waste had high levels of<lb/> waste from leftovers: too much was prepared, cooked or served.<lb/> 6.<lb/> As per the accepted definition of what contributes to &quot; 5 a day, &quot; fresh fruit and vegetables are<lb/> included (except for potatoes) alongside processed fruit, vegetables fruit juices and smoothies.<lb/></p>

			<head>(2) Hospitality and food service food waste (see WRAP, 2013c for more detail)<lb/></head>

			<p>The Hospitality and Food Service (HaFS) sector can be defined as outlets that sell food<lb/> and drinks for immediate consumption outside of the home. There are nine major HaFS<lb/> subsectors as defined by Horizons 8 : staff catering, healthcare, education, services, restaurants,<lb/> QSRs, pubs, hotels and leisure.<lb/> The cost of food being wasted in the UK from the UK HaFS sector is estimated at<lb/> GBP 2.5 billion per year in 2011, rising to GBP 3.0 billion per year by 2016. 920,000 tonnes<lb/> of food is wasted at outlets each year, 75% of which is avoidable and could have been eaten.<lb/> Preventing avoidable food waste has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by<lb/> 2.7 Mt (CO 2 equivalent). Overall 17.8% of total food purchased by the HaFS industry by<lb/> weight is wasted, of which 13.2% is avoidable and the remaining 4.6% is unavoidable. The<lb/> amount of food that is wasted is influenced by a number of factors, such as: the amount of on-<lb/>site food preparation, over-production of meals, menu choice and the extent to which<lb/> consumers leave food uneaten.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> highlights the scope of savings associated with food waste, ranked in descending<lb/> order of tonnes arising, with the restaurant, pub and education the top three subsectors. The<lb/> total costs associated with all food being wasted are greatest within restaurant, pub and hotel<lb/> subsectors.<lb/> Overall, the weight of food waste across the HaFS sector is equivalent to 1.3 billion<lb/> meals, or throwing away one in every six of the 8 billion meals served each year. This takes<lb/> account of differences in the average weight of a typical meal served across the nine different<lb/> UK HaFS subsectors. In restaurants, pubs, services and leisure the proportion of food waste is<lb/> over 20% of the weight of food purchased, equivalent to around one in five meals being<lb/> wasted. Lower wastage rates are associated with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) and staff<lb/> catering, where lighter meals are served and/or where snacks and &apos;grab and go&apos; 9 catering is<lb/> more prevalent<lb/> 8.<lb/> Horizons FS Limited, a supplier of market data and analysis for the UK HaFS sector<lb/> 9.<lb/> Note: a &apos;grab and go&apos; provision could have resulted in less of the food waste being captured by<lb/> the waste reviews conducted as part of this research as food waste may be disposed of away from<lb/> the main catering outlet.<lb/> Differences in levels of waste also relate to the use of ready-to-serve meals and pre-<lb/>prepared ingredients, in which case more of the waste is generated further up the supply chain<lb/> (an estimated 130 000 tonnes of food is wasted from the preparation of ready to serve food<lb/> items and meals at HaFS manufacturing sites. Ready-to-serve includes sandwiches, soups,<lb/> sauces and pre-prepared meals). For instance, the supply chain waste associated with QSR is<lb/> estimated to be equivalent to approximately a third of food waste discarded at QSR outlets.<lb/></p>

			<p>The composition of food that is wasted by the HaFS sector was compiled from research<lb/> conducted between 2009 and 2012, and the average composition of food waste is summarised<lb/> for HaFS as a whole in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.<lb/> Key findings on the composition of food being wasted include:<lb/> <lb/> 40% of all food waste is associated with &apos;carbohydrate foods&apos;, including the following<lb/> avoidable categories:<lb/>  potato and potato products (21%);<lb/>  bread and bakery (12%); and<lb/>  pasta/rice (7%).<lb/></p>

			<head><lb/></head>

			<p>The higher value food types account for a lower proportion of avoidable food waste,<lb/> for example:<lb/>  fruit and vegetable food waste (15%); and<lb/>  meat/fish (6%).<lb/></p>

			<head><lb/></head>

			<p>The quarter of all food waste that is unavoidable mainly consists of fruit and vegetable<lb/> peelings.<lb/></p>

			<p>Carbohydrates are a high priority across all subsectors, with wasted potatoes and potato<lb/> products a significant component of food being wasted. Action to reduce these food types<lb/> being wasted could have a significant impact in reducing the total amount of food being<lb/> wasted. Higher value food types are also wasted across the HaFS (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 10. Average composition of food being wasted in the UK HaFS sector<lb/> Source: WRAP (adapted from WRAP, 2013b).<lb/></figure>

			<p>WRAP also carried out research to understand the point at which food is being wasted<lb/> from spoilage, food preparation and from customer plates in different types of commercial<lb/> kitchens, and identify the actions that would most significantly reduce food being wasted.<lb/> This research shows that, on average:<lb/> <lb/> 21% of food waste arises from spoilage;<lb/> <lb/> 45% of food waste arises from food preparation; and<lb/> <lb/> 34% of food waste is generated from customer plates.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows where food waste arises in different kitchen types. The ratios of food waste<lb/> arising are consistent across three of the commercial kitchen types, namely, contract catering,<lb/> casual and fine dining. In the basic dining category, however, food waste from customer<lb/> plates (46%) is higher than waste from preparation (32%); this may be due to a number of<lb/> reasons including less food preparation on site.<lb/></p>

			<head>(3) Manufacturing and retail supply chain food waste (see WRAP, 2013a for more detail)<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2012 WRAP undertook work to provide robust estimates for the grocery supply chain<lb/> (agriculture/fishing and households were excluded from this supply chain research). Waste<lb/> disposed to sewer is also excluded (though WRAP has published estimates from signatories to<lb/> its Courtauld Commitment; WRAP 2011a). All food and drink waste arising in manufacturing<lb/> is attributed to the grocery retail market 10 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In total, some 10.7 Mt of food, drink and packaging is managed through the routes shown<lb/> in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. Not all of this material is legally classed as waste and not all is lost to human<lb/> consumption (though the majority is). Some material is legally classified as by-product and<lb/> 10.<lb/> Industrial classifications based on the dominant business activity at a site do not differentiate<lb/> between grocery retail and foodservice markets. Similarly, waste audit data and Courtauld<lb/> Commitment returns do not split out waste arising at a manufacturing site with respect to these<lb/> different markets.<lb/> may then be treated as a waste, in line with waste regulations. It has not proved possible to<lb/> fully quantify all these flows in this<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 11. Grocery waste and non-waste material flows in the United Kingdom<lb/> Source: WRAP.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The principal material output is waste (Column 1, waste food and packaging, <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>),<lb/> as legally defined, and the work undertaken provides estimates, for 2011, of total waste from<lb/> the grocery retail grocery sector disaggregated into food, packaging and mixed waste streams.<lb/> These data are further disaggregated into, for example, the management routes for this waste.<lb/> All the food and drink within this material is lost to human consumption.<lb/></p>

			<figure>WRAP estimates that there are 6.5 Mt of grocery waste. 11 This total comprises 1.6 Mt<lb/> from grocery retail and wholesale and 4.9 Mt from manufacturing.<lb/> Grocery retailers and manufacturers segregate some food for waste and other management<lb/> but there is also a significant quantity (0.8 Mt) of mixed waste that has not been segregated<lb/> 11.<lb/> Excludes all material that is disposed to sewer. Courtauld signatories reported some 0.2 Mt of<lb/> waste was disposed to sewer in 2010.This suggests there are significant additional quantities of<lb/> waste disposed this way and not included in the above total.<lb/> Waste, food and<lb/> packaging<lb/> Surplus food<lb/> redistributed<lb/> Food to animal<lb/> feed<lb/> By-products<lb/> 38 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM<lb/> OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015<lb/></figure>

			<p>and comprises both food and packaging (there is also 0.5 Mt of &apos;Other&apos; waste that is neither<lb/> food/drink nor packaging).<lb/> Total food waste from the grocery sector, therefore, includes food waste that is segregated<lb/> and an estimate of food that is part of mixed waste (that is, not segregated). Total food waste<lb/> in 2011 is 4.3 Mt. This includes 3.8 Mt of segregated food waste and 0.5 Mt of food included<lb/> in the mixed, non-segregated waste stream (of which 0.4 Mt is from grocery retail and 0.1 Mt<lb/> from manufacturing).<lb/> Food waste in manufacturing amounts to 3.9 Mt and in grocery retail (and wholesale)<lb/> 0.4 Mt.<lb/> Surplus food and drink that is redistributed (Column 2, surplus food redistributed,<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>) amounts to some 5 800 tonnes which goes to charities such as FareShare who use<lb/> the surplus food to feed people. In addition, a minimum of 11 000 tonnes of food and drink is<lb/> sold to organisations like &apos;The Company Shop&apos; who buy food for sale onto secondary<lb/> markets. 12 Both these routes for managing food are termed &apos;redistribution&apos; because the food is<lb/> still being consumed by humans, albeit probably involving an economic loss.<lb/> Food used as an ingredient in animal feed (Column 3, food to animal feed in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>) is<lb/> more difficult to estimate. Some food material can also fall into Column 4, by-products,<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> because they are legally defined as by-products (for example, spent grain from<lb/> distilleries). It has been estimated that around 450 000 tonnes of food is used as an ingredient<lb/> in animal feed and that further quantities of mostly unavoidable material like peelings and<lb/> skins are also sent for animal feed together with material legally classed as animal by-<lb/>products.<lb/></p>

			<p>Wholly within Column 4, of <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, are by-products from manufacturing operations<lb/> and animal by-products and co-products that arise from slaughtering cows, pigs, sheep,<lb/> chickens and fish. A total of 2.2 Mt of food is used as an ingredient in animal feed. About<lb/> 1.7 Mt is by-product and the remainder is food (Column 3 -food to animal feed, <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>).<lb/> In addition, the carcase and other material from slaughtered animals are regarded as animal<lb/> by-products (and co-products) under European legislation and primarily sent for rendering<lb/> which in turn produces pet food and a range of non-food products. There are about 2.0 Mt of<lb/> such material in the United Kingdom. 13<lb/> WRAP estimates that food and packaging waste is valued at GBP 6.9 billion. This<lb/> includes the costs of producing food and packaging, disposal costs and lost profit. For food<lb/> waste specifically the value is GBP 3.7 billion for manufacture and GBP 0.5 billion for retail.<lb/> This money is being wasted and value is being lost to the economy. The total represents<lb/> around 7% of consumer expenditure on food and drink and 8.6% of the sectors GVA. These<lb/> percentages are likely to be a higher proportion than many grocery retailer and manufacturer<lb/> profit margins (in comparison with sales). Whilst waste cannot be reduced to zero, there</p>

			<p>Across WRAP&apos;s work, the GHG impact of agriculture, manufacturing, grocery retail and<lb/> distribution is allocated to the food which is purchased by households. This means that no<lb/> impacts are allocated to the creation of waste produced at each of these stages. For<lb/> consistency, it is therefore appropriate only to attribute disposal emissions to the food waste<lb/> when considering the footprint of supply chain food waste. Waste emissions from<lb/> manufacture to grocery retail are estimated at 250 000 tonnes CO 2 e.<lb/> However, there is also an opportunity cost associated with the wasted food. The<lb/> opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone. Depending on whether the food<lb/> was suitable for animal feed or human consumption, the opportunity cost is between 1 and<lb/> 13 Mt CO 2 e respectively.<lb/> At present it is not possible to break down food waste arising in manufacturing and retail<lb/> by food type, although WRAP has produced detailed &apos;resource maps&apos; for key food categories,<lb/> such as fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and fish, which document waste and economic losses<lb/> through the supply chain (WRAP, 2011b).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.<lb/> Interventions and impact<lb/></head>

			<p>The primary mechanisms in the UK for facilitating the reduction in food waste are the<lb/> Courtauld Commitment (CC) 14 and Hospitality and Food Service Agreement (HaFSA) 15 , both<lb/> voluntary agreements managed by WRAP, and funded by Westminster, Scottish, Welsh and<lb/> Northern Ireland governments, and the consumer facing Love Food Hate Waste (LFHW)<lb/> campaign. 16<lb/></p>

			<head>(1) Household food waste<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the last six years WRAP has built up a comprehensive evidence base which has<lb/> raised awareness, developed a strong case for change and given focus to the areas where<lb/> consumers need the most help, where business and local authorities can benefit, and where the<lb/> biggest impacts can be made.<lb/> Influencing decisions around food product design, production processes, purchase and use<lb/> is challenging. WRAP has worked with a wide range of partners to develop a credible,<lb/> integrated and consistent approach, increasingly supporting people and organisations to<lb/> develop their own action plans. WRAP provides a suite of tools and guidelines making it<lb/> easier for those consumers who want to change to buy the right amounts of food and make the<lb/> most of what they buy.<lb/> WRAP launched LFHW in 2007 to help deliver practical ways to reduce food waste, and<lb/> expanded an agreement with the food industry (the CC) to help consumers make more of the<lb/> food and drink they buy, and throw less away.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since that work in 2007, tackling food and drink waste has received much attention in the<lb/> UK and indeed around the world: Governments, international agencies, businesses, local<lb/> authorities, community groups and many others have worked with consumers to change the<lb/> way we buy and use food. Major retailers, food brands and other manufacturers have helped<lb/> through innovations in products, packaging and labelling.<lb/> WRAP recently announced that there was 1.3 Mt less household food waste in 2012<lb/> compared to 2007, a 15% reduction, despite an increase of 4% in the number of households in<lb/> the UK (<ref type="biblio">WRAP, 2013b</ref>). Almost all, 85% (1.1 Mt; or enough to completely fill Wembley<lb/> Stadium) of this reduction was in food that could have been eaten (avoidable). Avoidable<lb/> household food waste reduced by 21%, which would have cost GBP 3.3 billion to purchase.<lb/> This means on average every household in the United Kingdom not having to spend GBP 130<lb/> a year on food bought but thrown away, helping to mitigate the impact of rising food prices.<lb/> In addition this will have prevented 4.4 Mt of carbon dioxide emissions a year, and saved a<lb/> billion tonnes of water. External factors have also influenced levels of household food waste<lb/> in this period, with an economic downturn and rising food prices. Untangling the<lb/> contributions of such factors is an ongoing focus of further research.<lb/></p>

			<p>The contributions to the large reduction in avoidable food and drink waste were primarily<lb/> concentrated in five categories, each with reductions of more than 100 000 tonnes: home-<lb/>made and pre-prepared meals, bakery, drink, fresh fruit and dairy and eggs. A range of<lb/> behaviours (buying appropriate amounts, storing food under the optimal conditions, portion<lb/> control, using the freezer more effectively etc.) and technical innovations (range of pack sizes<lb/> available, improved storage and freezing guidance, clearer date labelling, increased shelf-life,<lb/> packaging innovations etc.) will have contributed to these reductions, supported by LFHW<lb/> and its partners through a wide range of national and local initiatives.<lb/> Now in its third phase, the CC, with more than 50 of the largest food retailers, brands and<lb/> manufacturers as signatories, has a target to further reduce household food and drink waste by<lb/> another 5% by 2015.<lb/></p>

			<head>(2) Manufacturing and retail supply chain food waste<lb/></head>

			<p>The second phase of the CC introduced a target to reduce food and packaging waste in the<lb/> supply chain by 5% (2012 vs 2009).<lb/></p>

			<figure>WRAP has developed the W.A.S.T.E. process (Waste definition, Analyse and identify<lb/> root causes, Solution generation, Trial, evaluate and measure and Execute sustainable change<lb/> and reduce waste) to help businesses identify waste and reduce it within their operations and<lb/> across supply chains. The W.A.S.T.E. process is based on a problem-solving discipline rooted<lb/> in continuous improvement and LEAN manufacturing strategies and builds on established<lb/> techniques. Resources are also available to assist during the various stages of the W.A.S.T.E.<lb/></figure>

			<p>process. Good Practice Guidance for reducing waste has been produced, underpinned by<lb/> WRAP&apos;s activity and research through waste prevention reviews undertaken at 26 UK sites in<lb/> the food and drink manufacturing sector. In addition, waste prevention case studies highlight<lb/> WRAP&apos;s work with Courtauld signatories and other companies to prevent waste at UK<lb/> manufacturing sites. The studies identified the amount of waste created and determined root<lb/> causes of generation. Sustainable solutions were then developed and implemented by the<lb/> organisations to reduce their waste.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are opportunities to prevent waste within an individual site or business and across<lb/> supply chains. Working collaboratively across a supply chain can lead to higher levels of<lb/> waste prevention.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the CC (phase 2) traditional food and packaging waste in the grocery supply chain<lb/> was reduced by 7.4%, exceeding the 5% target. Supply chain waste decreased by 217,000<lb/> tonnes per year over the period (WRAP, 2013e).<lb/> reduce waste by 90%. A similar exercise with bagged salad suggested waste could be reduced<lb/> by between a third and 80%.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5.<lb/> The voluntary approach<lb/></head>

			<p>Based on the experience in the United Kingdom, we would highlight the following factors<lb/> as important for successfully reducing food waste:<lb/>  An evidence-based strategy, to identify priorities, build a persuasive case for action,<lb/> develop clear and robust recommendations and inform the development of effective<lb/> messages and materials for engaging with consumers, industry and other stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<p> An integrated approach, looking across the whole supply chain (recognising the<lb/> influence those at any given stage in the supply chain can have on others in the supply<lb/> chain), and also in terms of householders incorporating three key elements (national /<lb/> large scale awareness raising campaigns, local / community engagement to influence<lb/> behaviours and changes to products, packaging and labelling to make it easier to buy the<lb/> right amounts of food and use what is bought), which if implemented together deliver<lb/> much more than any element in isolation.<lb/></p>

			<figure> A framework for action, such as the CC and HaFSA, with collective targets which<lb/> provides a mechanism for sharing best practice and facilitating the uptake of<lb/> recommendations for change.<lb/>  Monitoring and reporting, to assess progress against targets, allow changes in action to<lb/> be made in response to this and to recognise (publically) achievements (show what can be<lb/> done) and benefits of taking action.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The United Kingdom has worked successfully with industry to reduce supply chain food<lb/> and packaging waste by nearly 10% (2009 to 2012), while household food waste is down by<lb/> even more -15% between 2007 and 2012. The latest results from the CC show that the<lb/> voluntary approach can deliver real reductions in waste, while allowing businesses to reduce<lb/> waste and be more efficient and competitive. Business continues to value the voluntary<lb/> agreement form as one where they can receive impartial information and tools, and work<lb/> together with their supply chains for a common aim. As well as the continuation of the CC to<lb/> reduce food and packaging waste in the retail and manufacturing sector, the United Kingdom<lb/> has launched a further voluntary agreement which takes the same approach with the<lb/> hospitality and food service sector.<lb/> The impact of CC3 is predicted to be a cumulative reduction of 1.1 Mt of waste, 2.9 Mt of<lb/> CO 2 e and a cost benefit of GBP 1.6 billion to consumers, the food and drink sector and local<lb/> authorities. During the three phases of the CC, a 20% reduction in household food waste is<lb/> expected to be achieved.<lb/></p>

			<p>The new HaFSA is a voluntary agreement with the hospitality and food service sector,<lb/> which includes restaurants, hotels, caterers and pubs. This agreement supports the sector in<lb/> preventing and recycling food and packaging waste. There is now about 24% coverage of the<lb/> sector by food and drink sales (with over 170 signatories and supporters). The target is 25%.<lb/> Voluntary agreements can be effective in achieving policy aims in certain circumstances.<lb/> Some voluntary schemes in the United Kingdom, such as the CC have proven effective in<lb/> reducing waste production.<lb/> This approach does not just allow improvements to be made as a result of specialist<lb/> advice from WRAP as it also provides a safe forum for signatories to share knowledge and<lb/> best practice. The targets are for signatories to reach as a whole so it&apos;s important to<lb/> promulgate best practice horizontally and vertically through the supply chain. The advantage<lb/> of a voluntary approach is that it allows businesses to make informed decisions, which should<lb/> generally result in efficiency savings for the business. Partners are engaged as they have made<lb/> a specific commitment to make improvement to processes to reduce waste.<lb/> WRAP&apos;s LFHW campaign helps consumers to make informed choices on reducing food<lb/> waste. LFHW has established a respected, credible and effective brand, materials and<lb/> messages, working in partnership with a broad range of organisations (e.g. local councils,<lb/> retailers and the food supply chain). Through LFHW, consumers have been helped to save<lb/> money and waste less food by a combination of helpful advice, tools (meal planning;<lb/> portioning) and simple but inspiring recipe ideas.<lb/> LFHW messages have been used by CC signatories as a key tool to meet the household<lb/> food waste target. This demonstrates the joined up approach whereby retailers have targets for<lb/> both supply chain and for households, so extending the reach beyond merely reducing their<lb/> own waste but also in influencing and considering the potential indirect effects of the actions<lb/> of signatories.<lb/> While CC is a UK based agreement it provides opportunities beyond that. The operations<lb/> of many signatories extend beyond UK borders, and so opportunities exist for these partners<lb/> to apply such knowledge beyond their UK operations.<lb/> While the primary focus is waste prevention, a resilient supply chain will always have<lb/> some surplus. WRAP has worked with industry to assess how much good quality surplus food<lb/> that would otherwise have gone to waste can be made available for redistribution. An industry<lb/> working group led by WRAP has agreed a set of guiding principles that the wider industry<lb/> can sign up to. These principles will help industry to communicate how they prioritise<lb/> redistribution for human consumption internally and externally. CC3 encourages action in line<lb/> with the waste hierarchy. If surplus food cannot be prevented, the next best option is to ensure<lb/> it is redistributed for human consumption.<lb/></p>

			<p>As the voluntary approach allows for information sharing between businesses, this allows<lb/> better interventions across the waste hierarchy. Companies should apply the waste hierarchy<lb/> but as this collaborative approach provides a forum, by sharing best practice this provides<lb/> opportunities to correctly manage waste, when it arises, so surplus food can be redistributed to<lb/> people, or for animal feed if it is not suitable for human consumption, otherwise Anaerobic<lb/> Digestion or composting are preferable alternatives to landfilling. To attempt the same gains<lb/> from regulation would not necessary bring such collaboration as shared voluntary targets<lb/> which signatories need to work together to meet.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.6.<lb/> Challenges and opportunities for the future<lb/></head>

			<p>While the United Kingdom has made positive progress in reducing food waste, it is likely<lb/> that further reduction will become increasingly challenging (for example as the &apos;quick wins&apos;<lb/> will have been achieved). There will be a point at which the benefit from further reductions<lb/> may be outweighed by the resource used to achieve that reduction, but we do not believe we<lb/> have yet reached that point. However, the rate of reduction is likely to reduce as that point is<lb/> approached.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The European Commission&apos;s recent Circular Economy package (2014) includes a<lb/> proposal for an aspirational objective of a 30% reduction in food waste by 2025. A reduction<lb/> of 30% by 2025, from 2007 levels (when the United Kingdom ramped up efforts to decrease<lb/> food waste), could be achieved but would be extremely challenging. The new report by<lb/> WRAP (2014d) provides an analysis of potential future reductions in food waste in the United<lb/> Kingdom, and the associated costs and benefits.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Population growth will limit the absolute reductions possible as demand for food<lb/> increases. This is likely to have two effects a) to increase unavoidable food waste as this is<lb/> primarily influenced by population size and overall amounts of food purchased, and b) make<lb/> percentage reduction in overall food waste more challenging as the increased demand will act<lb/> to counterbalance any reducing effect on avoidable waste (for example between 2007 and<lb/> 2012 avoidable food waste at a household level reduced by 24% in the United Kingdom, but<lb/> 21% at a national level as the population increased by around 4% over that period).<lb/> External economic factors such as economic growth and any potential fall in food prices<lb/> could result in some behavioural reversion as economic factors become less significant<lb/> drivers to encourage households to reduce waste.<lb/> WRAP has been having discussions with governments and industry stakeholders about a<lb/> new framework for collaborative action in the United Kingdom to follow the third phase of<lb/> CC, which is proposed to be a ten-year framework (2016-2025) for collaborative action across<lb/> the food and drink life-cycle, helping businesses to become more resilient to future changes in<lb/> supply and demand. Targets have not yet been agreed but one area of focus is likely to be a<lb/> continued reduction in food waste (WRAP, 2014f).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.7.<lb/> Implications of reductions in food waste<lb/></head>

			<p>An analysis of the amounts (tonnage) of food and drink bought in the UK does show a<lb/> significant reduction, at a household level, of around 4% between 2007 and 2012. This<lb/> reduction is consistent with consumers having to buy less (as they waste less), but will of<lb/> course also have been influenced by other initiatives such as those aimed at promoting healthy<lb/> eating. However, population growth has meant there was only a reduction of ca 0.5% at a UK<lb/> level, suggesting that an increase in population (of 4.4%) has off-set most of the reduction due<lb/> to less food being wasted. 19 The UK population is forecast to grow by 6.1 million people by<lb/> 2025, a 10% increase, and would (with current consumption patterns) require need an extra<lb/> 4.1 Mt of food; much more than the further reduction in food waste thought possible by that<lb/> time (1.7 Mt).<lb/> In addition econometric modelling (WRAP, 2014c) suggests that as consumers find ways<lb/> to avoid waste, many change their purchasing behaviour and buy smaller quantities of more<lb/> expensive food, which is a form of &quot; trading up. &quot; It would be useful to develop further<lb/> understanding of such behaviours to quantify the economic effect of reducing food waste.<lb/> Reducing waste in manufacture or the grocery retail and hospitality and food service<lb/> supply chains will deliver financial savings, and the potential for increases in productivity and<lb/> competitiveness. The UK currently has a food trade deficit of around GBP 19 billion (the<lb/> same value as that for food wasted across the supply chain), and therefore there should also be<lb/> opportunities to reduce dependency on food imports (for some food types) and increase<lb/> exports.</p>
