			<body>1 <lb/>Teaching in Focus – 2017/16 (April) ©OECD 2017 <lb/>How can professional development enhance <lb/>teachers&apos; classroom practices? <lb/>•  Teacher professional development is deemed to be high quality when it includes opportunities for active<lb/>learning methods, an extended time period, a group of colleagues, and collective learning activities <lb/>or research with other teachers. The higher the exposure of teachers to high-quality professional <lb/>development, the more likely they are to use a wide variety of teaching practices in the classroom. <lb/>•  Professional development activities that focus on curriculum knowledge (rather than subject knowledge<lb/>or pedagogy) and that involve collaborating with other teachers seem particularly well suited to <lb/>enhancing teachers&apos; classroom practices. However, these types of professional development are not <lb/>those that are most widely used around the world. <lb/>•  Not all teachers have equal access to high-quality professional development. In some countries and<lb/>economies, different participation rates in high-quality professional development are observed between <lb/>male and female teachers, as well as between teachers who have and have not completed initial teacher <lb/>education. <lb/>What is TALIS? <lb/>TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) is the first international survey examining teaching and learning <lb/>environments in schools. It asks teachers and school principals about their work, their schools and their classrooms. <lb/>This cross-country analysis helps countries identify others facing similar challenges and learn about their policies. <lb/>TALIS 2013 focused on lower secondary education teachers and their principals. It sampled 200 schools in more than <lb/>30 countries and 20 teachers in each school. <lb/>More information is available at: www.oecd.org/talis <lb/>TA LI S <lb/>TA LI S <lb/>Participation in high-quality professional development and classroom practices <lb/>Ensuring that teachers around the world have the essential competencies they require to be effective in the <lb/>classroom is key to raising levels of student achievement. Education systems, therefore, seek to provide teachers <lb/>with opportunities for developing and extending their competencies in order to achieve or maintain a high-standard <lb/>of teaching and develop a high-quality teacher workforce. <lb/>Teacher professional development is deemed to be high quality when it includes opportunities for active learning <lb/>methods (i.e. not only listening to a lecturer), an extended time period, a group of colleagues from the teacher&apos;s <lb/>school or subject group, and collective learning activities or research with other teachers. According to TALIS 2013 <lb/>data from 35 countries and economies, teachers who have taken part in high-quality professional development <lb/>are also more likely to use classroom practices that are known to promote student learning (see Figure 1), such as <lb/>presenting a summary of recently learned content, having students work in small groups, and providing written or <lb/>immediate feedback on student work -see Box 1 for a description of the ten main classroom practices identified. <lb/>A positive relationship between participation in high-quality professional development and at least 5 of the 10 <lb/>classroom practices is found in 13 countries and economies, while 11 countries and economies show a positive <lb/>T E AC HING in Focus <lb/>2017/16 (April) <lb/>16 <lb/>©OECD 2017 Teaching in Focus – 2017/16 (April) <lb/>2 <lb/>Teaching in Focus <lb/>relationship with all 10 classroom practices. TALIS results suggest that teacher participation in high-quality <lb/>professional development is systematically associated with a more intense use of some of the classroom practices <lb/>that are key to student learning. <lb/>Countries are ranked in descending order by number of significant estimates across classroom practices. <lb/>Note: Bars indicate the change in the odds of reporting the use of each classroom practice.

Teachers who have participated in professional development <lb/>activities that focus on any of these types of content also tend to more frequently use often-praised classroom practices <lb/>(see Figure 2). For every country and economy (with the exception of Croatia), there is one focus of professional <lb/>development activities that is consistently positively related to a more intense use of at least some instructional <lb/>methods. <lb/>Participating in professional development that focuses on the curriculum rather than subject matter or pedagogy <lb/>makes a teacher more likely to report making an effort to enhance students&apos; learning and means teachers are more <lb/>likely to use each instructional method (with the exception of presenting a summary of recently learned content and <lb/>checking students&apos; notebooks). <lb/>Countries are ranked in descending order by number of significant estimates across classroom practices. <lb/>Note: Bars indicate the change in the odds of reporting the use of each classroom practice.

However, <lb/>these types of professional development programmes are much less widespread than other kinds of professional <lb/>development activities. In 28 countries and economies, teachers participate less often in curriculum-focused professional <lb/>development than in programmes covering subject knowledge or pedagogy (see Figure 4). Similarly, in 27 countries and <lb/>economies, teachers participate less often in professional development programmes that include some collaborative <lb/>activities with other teachers than in programmes that include any other kind of delivery feature. <lb/>How to best implement teacher professional development? <lb/>Apart from the focus of teacher professional development, how it is delivered is essential for developing teachers&apos; <lb/>instructional practices. The components of professional development activities that best support teachers&apos; work include: <lb/>active learning – giving teachers opportunities for active learning methods apart from simply listening to a lecture; duration <lb/>– an extended time period with several occasions for professional development spread out over several weeks or months; <lb/>collective participation – including a group of colleagues from the teacher&apos;s school or subject group; and collaboration – <lb/>collaborative learning activities or research with other teachers. These are all features of professional development that <lb/>are, in general, positively related with a more intense use of classroom practices. Some negative associations are observed, <lb/>in particular, when collective participation is involved. Collaborative learning activities or research with other teachers <lb/>are the only features of professional development programmes that are consistently positively associated with teachers&apos; <lb/>instructional methods. <lb/>TA LI S <lb/>TA LI S <lb/>Teaching in Focus – 2017/16 (April) ©OECD 2017 5 <lb/>Teaching in Focus <lb/>To learn more <lb/>Barrera-Pedemonte, F.

However, only a small proportion of teachers have participated <lb/>in such programmes. Educational systems could enhance teaching quality by increasing the opportunities <lb/>for professional development. In some countries and economies, different participation rates in high-<lb/>quality professional development are observed between female and male teachers, with female teachers <lb/>more likely to participate in high-quality professional development in Chile, Estonia, Portugal, the Russian <lb/>Federation and Spain, while the opposite pattern is found in the Netherlands and in Norway. Similar <lb/>differences in participation are observed between teachers who have and have not completed initial teacher <lb/>education. Wherever such differences in participation exist, education systems should remove the barriers <lb/>to accessing the kinds of high-quality professional development related to teacher gender or completion of <lb/>initial teacher education. <lb/>This paper is published under the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD.
