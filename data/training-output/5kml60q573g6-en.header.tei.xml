	<p type="introduction">The European Commission requested Sigma to carry out a study on the regulatory management capacities of the<lb/> ten countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 to learn more about their Better Regulation practices, exchange<lb/> good practices and make suggestions for further improvements. This study was carried out by way of peer<lb/> reviews taking place between March 2005 and October 2006.<lb/> The topics examined were notably: the origins of EU Better Regulation policy, regulatory management<lb/> processes, the tools used in these processes (impact assessment, consultation, simplification, alternatives and<lb/> accessibility), enactment processes and the enforcement and compliance of laws in the NMS, with reference to<lb/> intellectual property law and environmental laws.<lb/> Each peer reviews led to a country report that was sent to the Commission and the Member State in question.<lb/> Publication of each country report was left to the discretion of the Member State in question. A synthesis was<lb/> drawn up summarizing all findings and making recommendations addressed to all new Member States in<lb/> general.<lb/></p>

	<div type="abstract">Enhancing the competitiveness of its economy through increased productivity growth is one of<lb/> the main challenges recognised by the European Union in the original Lisbon strategy and the<lb/> renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (adopted in 2000 and 2005 respectively). The<lb/> improvement of the regulatory environment and regulatory processes at the level of the<lb/> Institutions of the EU and its Member States is a key factor in creating a business environment<lb/> conducive to productivity growth.<lb/> This policy is known as &apos;Better Regulation.&apos; This policy does not mean more regulation or less<lb/> regulation but involves the putting in place of processes which ensure that all regulations are<lb/> easy to understand, apply, comply with and are of high quality.<lb/> Regulation plays a central role in the functioning of economies and is essential to address market<lb/> failures, foster competition, promote safety, health and welfare and facilitate the protection of the<lb/> environment. High quality regulation achieves these objectives at least possible cost. Low quality<lb/> regulation may have the opposite effect.<lb/></div>

	<p type="introduction">Review of the Regulatory Management Capacities of Each of the NMS<lb/> Much is known about the implementation of Better Regulation policy in the Institutions of the EU<lb/> and in some Member States of the EU. Less is known about the implementation of Better<lb/> Regulation policy in the 10 countries that joined the EU on the 1 st May 2004 (NMS). In order to<lb/> learn more about developments in Better Regulation in the 10 NMS, the European Commission<lb/> requested Sigma to study this issue.<lb/> The studies were designed, primarily, as fact finding exercises and did not judge the quality of<lb/> their regulations and were used as a means to encourage the development of Better Regulation<lb/> policy. This report is a synthesis of these studies which were conducted between March 2005<lb/> and October 2006.<lb/> The studies examined: the origins of EU Better Regulation policy to provide a context for the<lb/> studies, regulatory management processes, the tools used in these processes (impact<lb/> assessment, consultation, simplification, alternatives and accessibility), enactment processes<lb/> and the enforcement and compliance of laws in the NMS, with reference to intellectual property<lb/> law and environmental laws.<lb/> The NMS are geographically and culturally diverse but share the experience of adopting the<lb/> acquis communautaire in a remarkably short period and now face the pressure of interpreting it<lb/> and applying it to their own conditions. Eight of these countries experienced an acceleration of<lb/> history as they moved from command and control economies to free market economies. This<lb/> meant not only the adaptation of their economies but also significant and substantial changes to<lb/> their administrative cultures and political institutional environments.<lb/> Conclusions<lb/> 1. Political leadership will be necessary to encourage sustained attention to Better<lb/> Regulation policy, accordingly, Better Regulation Units need to engage political attention<lb/> Recommendations Common to all NMS<lb/> The report makes recommendations that are common to all NMS:<lb/> 1. Political support is essential to develop and maintain a policy on Better Regulation.<lb/> 2. A policy to achieve Better Regulation works best when there are appropriate and<lb/> adequately-funded arrangements in place to support and maintain it.<lb/> 3. Regulatory management capacities may be developed through the effective use of<lb/> Better Regulation tools.<lb/> 4. Executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate in a constructive way<lb/> to ensure wise governance.<lb/> 5. More attention needs to be paid to enforcement and compliance.<lb/> GOV/SIGMA(2007)6<lb/> GOV/SIGMA(2007)6<lb/> 3.<lb/> REGULATORY MANAGEMENT<lb/> This section examines regulatory management in the NMS.<lb/> Regulatory management is the process whereby problems facing a country are selected for<lb/> policy analysis, decision and drafting into legislation. The decision to formulate policy and draft<lb/> legislation is taken by government or a minister, if delegated to do so. The focus in this Chapter,<lb/> therefore, is on regulatory management process.</p>
