in contingent liability management by 
Lerzan Ülgentürk and members of the OECD Task Force on Contingent 
Liabilities and Public Debt Management* Abstract Contingent liabilities are major sources of fiscal risks due to the uncertain financial 
commitments they involve. Their effective management, therefore, is essential for increasing 
stability and predictability in public finance. This paper explores the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management based 
on the results of a background OECD survey and the information provided by seven task force 
countries. The results indicate that there are certain roles and responsibilities assumed by the 
public debt managers in this field, while the degree of involvement differs widely across 
countries. We also observed that the debt management offices' (DMOs) involvement is more 
prominent in the management of government credit guarantees, while contingent liabilities 
arising from Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and government sponsored insurance 
programmes appear to be outside the domain of public debt managers in most cases. Drawing 
on leading country practices and lessons from the past, this paper advises public debt managers 
on possible motives and areas of involvement. Authorised for release by Pierre Poret,

do not effectively manage fiscal risks arising from contingent liabilities and take necessary risk 
management measures in a timely manner, they can be caught unprepared for their fiscal burden. From a sovereign debt management perspective, effective management of fiscal risks arising 
from contingent liabilities has long been a concern because realisation of these risks has direct 
consequences on governments' fiscal positions and thereby public debt managers' debt and cash 
management policies and operations. Our research shows that governments have increased their use of guarantees and other types of 
contingent liabilities since the global financial crisis; in fact, the use of such instruments was a key 
element of policy response to the crisis. Areas where this increase is most evident are; financial sector 
support; credit enhancement for infrastructure financing in traditional and PPP procurement models; 
and SME financing. Thus, effective management and monitoring of contingent liabilities has become 
more important for governments than in the past. Against this background, this paper explores the role of public debt managers in managing 
explicit contingent liabilities based on country practices. To this end, we considered responses to a 
survey on contingent liabilities among DMOs 1 of OECD countries and two non-OECD countries 
(Brazil and South Africa) conducted by the OECD's Bond Markets and Public Debt Management Unit 
in October 2013. Additionally, the paper examines task force members -Turkey (Chair), Sweden, 
Denmark, Iceland, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa -experiences (Annex A). One key finding of this study shows that the degree of DMO involvement in this area varies 
widely across countries, as well as by types of contingent liabilities, of Debt managers' experiences 
are also quite diverse, stemming mainly from weight variance of different sources of contingent 
liabilities in task force countries, and from differences in their public financial management 
frameworks. However, there are similarities among countries with respect to fiscal risk management 
tools and methods employed for managing and mitigating risks of contingent liabilities, such as 
guarantee issuance guidelines, budgetary limits, contingency reserve funds, parliamentary reporting, 
etc. Study findings point to the more active involvement of DMOs in management of government 
credit guarantees compared to other sources of contingent liabilities. The study analyses country practices in three categories of contingent liabilities from the public 
debt management (PDM) perspective: i) government credit guarantees, ii) contingent liabilities arising 
from PPPs and iii) government sponsored insurance schemes. It provides insights and 
recommendations to help DMOs enhance their management practices. In countries where DMOs do 
not have any roles and responsibilities in fiscal risk management in general and contingent liability 1 Throughout this study, the term Debt Management Office (DMO) refers to the organisational unit with having 
the mandate of the PDM in a country, regardless of the institutional structure – autonomous agency or 
part of ministry of finance/treasury/central bank. 6 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 management in particular, the following recommendations may be relevant for other government 
units. In the area of government credit guarantees, this research builds largely upon information 
collected in responses to the OECD survey. The recommendations include conducting cost and risk 
analysis before guarantee issuance, charging fees at levels covering at least the expected costs, clearly 
defining and limiting the guarantees in time and scope in credit guarantee contracts, applying ceilings 
to promote fiscal discipline, increasing governments' ability to cover possible future losses and 
monitoring the overall position through contingency reserve funds, and enhancing transparency by 
sharing both quantitative and qualitative information. This study suggests certain areas for more active involvement by public debt managers in the 
management of contingent liabilities arising from PPPs. DMOs can collaborate with the central 
budget authority and PPP units in data consolidation, forecasting and reporting practices on PPP 
contingent liabilities; or include this information in their debt reporting. The study highlights the need 
for a central government unit analysing PPP guarantees to inform decision-making authorities on 
associated costs and risks. At the portfolio level, central monitoring of contingent liabilities under PPP 
contracts for ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability is considered essential where public debt managers 
can be effectively involved. It is important to note that guarantee valuation is key for informing PPP 
decision making, since guarantees change the risk allocation between the public and private partner. Under the government sponsored insurance schemes category, the study focuses on explicit 
contingent commitments by governments under such schemes. It recommends that clear legislative 
frameworks should define the scope and nature of the role of government within insurance 
programmes. Regular co-ordination and communication mechanisms between relevant agencies and 
public debt managers over fiscal risks arising from the financial system are essential for effective 
information sharing. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 7 PART 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. 
Background and purpose OECD best practices in the area of contingent liability management from the perspective of debt 
managers were formulated in 2005 with the study  " Explicit Contingent Liabilities in Debt 
Management'' 2 (2005 Report). The 2005 report recommends centralisation of risk management of 
government debt portfolio including contingent liabilities and suggests that public debt managers are 
well positioned to assume this duty. The report characterises contingent liabilities as a latent form of 
sovereign debt, and discusses that their management might call for involvement of public debt 
managers. During the 22 nd OECD Global Forum on Public Debt Management (24-25 January 2013, Paris), 
where the 2005 Report was distributed as a background document, there was a discussion on the 
policy framework for capturing, measuring and mitigating the fiscal risks arising from contingent 
liabilities. Delegates agreed there was a need to carry out further studies on the role of public debt 
managers in contingent liability management, focusing more on the implementation side to add to the 
analytical framework provided by the 2005 report. Delegates also suggested that new work should 
cover post crisis developments and PPP guarantees. In October 2013, the OECD's Bond Markets and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a 
survey on contingent liabilities among DMOs of OECD countries and two non-OECD countries 
(Brazil and South Africa.to which 33 countries (out of 36), replied. The survey included detailed 
questions about management of explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. As the next step, a task 
force was formed, consisting of seven countries -Turkey (Chair), Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Mexico, 
Brazil and South Africa, to work with the OECD on this subject area, Task force members drafted 
detailed and comprehensive reports (Annex A) on their contingent liability management structures 
and operations. Given this background, the aim of this paper is: i) to explore the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management, drawing on the 
information compiled through the OECD survey and the task force country contributions ii) provide 
policy conclusions and recommendations for DMOs. The paper benefits from, and builds upon, the 
2005 report's analytical framework. 3 2 The 2005 Report was drafted by an ad hoc expert group of the OECD WPDM. Members of the expert group 
were: Lars Hörngren, Swedish National Debt Office (SNDO), Sweden (chairman). Jan Holmberg, 
State Treasury, Finland. Morten Kjaergaard, Government Debt Management, Danmarks Nationalbank, 
Denmark. Wojciech Rzasiecki, Ministry of Finance, Poland. Jacek Skrzynski, Ministry of Finance, 
Poland. Marek Szczerbak, Ministry of Finance, Poland. Magnus Thor, Swedish National Debt Office, 
Sweden. 3 As this work draws on the 2005 Report, it includes several direct excerpts from it. 8 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 1.2. 
Types of contingent liabilities and the study's scope Various definitions of the term  " contingent liability "  exist in fiscal management literature. The 
OECD's Best Practices for Budget Transparency defines contingent liabilities as  " … liabilities whose 
budgetary impact is dependent on future events which may or may not occur (2002: 13) " . They are 
defined as  " obligations whose timing and magnitude depend on the occurrence of some uncertain 
future event outside the control of the government "  by Cebotari A. (2008: 5). There are also some 
other definitions in accounting and statistical standard manuals. 4 A common feature of these 
definitions is the existence of  " uncertainty "  over the obligation in question. Uncertainty differentiates 
contingent liabilities from direct liabilities. Contingent liabilities become government obligations only 
when triggered by a pre-defined event or condition, the occurrence of which is not certain. In literature, contingent liabilities are divided into two main groups based on the notion of 
 " obligation " : 5 explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. Explicit contingent liabilities are contractual 
government commitments to make certain payments if a particular event occurs. The basis of these 
commitments can be contracts, laws, or clear policy statements. Governments issue explicit contingent 
liabilities in order to subsidise certain activities, (e.g. housing production, exports, and student loans) 
or to fill gaps in the markets that private solutions are deemed unable to cover (e.g. risks that are too 
large for markets to bear). The most common examples of such liabilities are government credit 
guarantees, explicit guarantee commitments under investment projects and government sponsored 
insurance programmes. Implicit contingent liabilities are political or moral obligations of the 
government to intervene, mostly in the event of a crisis or a natural disaster. Governments do not 
recognise these liabilities until a particular event occurs. While the financial system constitutes the 
most common source for these liabilities, it is quite common to see governments covering losses or 
debt obligations of sub-national governments and public corporations. Implicit contingent liabilities 
are difficult to assess, let alone manage in a consistent manner, precisely because of their implicit 
nature. This study adopts a central government viewpoint while setting a dividing line between the two 
categories of contingent liabilities. Table 1 shows the categorisation of direct and contingent liabilities 
of different levels of government and private sector as contingent liabilities of  " central government " . 
To give an example, direct debt obligations of local governments or public corporations are implicit 
contingent liabilities of central government, as central government might have to cover these 
obligations in case of failure of these public bodies. Likewise, central governments might assume in 
times of crisis and disasters, non-guaranteed debt of private banks, large corporations or even 
households. Table 1 also shows how wide the scope of implicit contingent liabilities is for central 
government, as it can encompass all financial commitments of the public sector and theoretically even 
that of the private sector. 4 The definition in the System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 is as follows:  " A contingent liability is a 
possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the entity. "  ESA 2010 defines contingent liabilities as;  " Contingent assets and contingent liabilities 
are agreements whereby one party is obliged to provide a payment or series of payments to another 
unit only where certain specific conditions prevail " . 5 Lindwall P. (2013) provides other classifications of contingent liabilities based on magnitude/impact, 
probability, government influence and measurability. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 9 Table 1. Direct and contingent liabilities of central government Liabilities of

*** Explicit contingent liabilities This paper elaborates the main sources of explicit contingent liabilities 6 into three sub-groups. 
The first group consists of government credit guarantees, which we define as liabilities based on 
contracts through which the government assumes the whole or part of the credit risk of a loan 
extended to another party. In case the borrower fails to fulfil its obligations, the lender can turn to the 
government as guarantor and claim payment of interest and/or principal. In this study, the term 
 " government credit guarantee "  refers to all types of guarantees covering debt service obligations of 
beneficiaries and, as such, includes government guarantees issued for bonds as well. 7,8 However, this 
study categorised credit guarantees issued within the framework of PPP projects within a different 
group to be discussed subsequently. In this conceptual framework, government credit guarantees 
comprise: 6 Selected country practices presented in Annex A include information on the experiences of task force countries 
with implicit contingent liabilities as well. 7 The term  " loan guarantees "  is also widely used in the literature. Please also note that the SNA 2008 attaches a 
different meaning to the term  " credit guarantee "  referring to it as guarantees to disburse un-utilized 
loan amounts. 8 The SNA 2008 categorises credit guarantees as standardised guarantees and one-off guarantees. Accordingly, 
 " Standardised guarantees are composed of the sorts of guarantees that are issued in large numbers, 
usually for fairly small amounts, along identical lines. There are three parties involved in these 
arrangements, the debtor, the creditor and the guarantor. Either the debtor or creditor may contract 
with the guarantor to repay the creditor if the debtor defaults. The classic examples are export credit 
guarantees and student loan guarantees. "   " …one-off guarantees, consists of those where the loan or 
the security is so particular that it is not possible for the degree of risk associated with the debt to be 
calculated with any degree of accuracy.  " Standardised guarantees are to be distinguished from one-off 
guarantees based on two criteria: a. They are characterised by often repeated transactions with similar 
features and pooling of risks; b. Guarantors are able to estimate the average loss based on available 
statistics by using a probability-weighted concept. One-off guarantees are, on the contrary, individual, 
and guarantors are not able to make a reliable estimate of the risk of calls. "  10 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017  individual guarantees issued for public institutions like public corporations or local 
governments, public or private development banks; mostly for their investment financing 
operations  programme guarantees provided for large groups of beneficiaries, as in guarantees on 
housing loans, student loans, export and SME credits  guarantees extended to bonds issued by commercial banks  individual bond guarantees in countries where public institutions borrow from capital 
markets. The second group consists of contingent liabilities arising from projects realised under PPP 
models. PPPs are long term contractual arrangements between the government and a private partner 
whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the associated risks 
(OECD, 2012). Here the coverage is the government liabilities in the PPPs, which are explicit and 
contingent. In this context, PPP contingent liabilities include:  financial guarantees in the form of credit and refinancing guarantees  revenue guarantees  exchange rate guarantees  termination payment commitments  debt assumption commitments  sub-sovereign creditworthiness guarantees. The third sub-group consists of government sponsored insurance programmes. Here, the 
scope again is explicit commitments by central government, which are also contingent upon some 
future events. Therefore, fully private insurance programmes are outside the scope of this study. 
Government sponsored insurance programmes are:  deposit insurance programmes funded or explicitly supported by the government  other government insurance programmes such as disaster risk insurance and terrorism 
insurance. There are other sources of explicit contingent liabilities not covered by this study, such as legal 
claims against government, uncalled capital commitments to international organisations or country 
specific forms of government contractual liabilities carrying uncertainties. Implicit contingent liabilities, on the other hand, are much wider in scope. As such, their 
management requires an orchestrated effort among various institutions and players in the economy. 
When realised however, their negative effects on the governments' fiscal positions are more 
significant than explicit contingent liabilities, as the recent global financial crisis has shown. Thus, it is 
important for debt managers to have the necessary risk awareness about implicit contingent liabilities, 
as well as other sources of fiscal risks. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 11 The present report is informed by results from the OECD Committee on Financial Markets 
(CMF) workstream covering both explicit and implicit financial sector guarantees, although it takes 
the specific and somewhat narrower perspective of a public debt and risk manager and focuses on 
explicit contingent liabilities only. As part of this workstream, the CMF has numerous studies on the 
benefits and costs of the extension of various financial safety net aspects, including on competition, 
incentives and risk-taking and taxpayer liabilities (see e.g. OECD, 2011 and Schich and Kim, 2011). 1.3. 
Global crisis and contingent liabilities It has been more than eight years since the onset of the global financial crisis. Policy responses of 
governments aimed at mitigating the negative effects of the crisis especially over financial markets 
have resulted in sizable increases in government debt and further deteriorations in fiscal balances, 9 
Concern continues over the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis, impairing efforts to restore 
confidence among investors, financial intermediaries and households; and putting downward pressure 
on global economic growth. Progress achieved in reducing fiscal imbalances in OECD countries has not been at sufficient 
levels to contain the public debt burden. Figure 1 shows central government marketable gross debt for 
different country groupings. Debt accumulation is higher in G7 countries affected most seriously by 
the crisis, while there is also an important increase in the OECD area of approximately 30% during the 
period 2007-2014. 10 Figure 1. Central government marketable gross debt in OECD countries Percentage of GDP Source: OECD (2014), OECD Sovereign Borrowing Outlook 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/sov_b_outlk-2014-en Large-scale support of governments to the financial sector was a characteristic of the post crisis 
environment, taking various forms including unlimited coverages for deposits, capital injections, asset 
purchases and finally yet importantly, guarantees on bank bonds. The policy responses have been 9 For an analysis of post-crisis challenges for public debt management, see Blommestein, H. et al.

Sovereign Borrowing Outlook 2014. 12 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 effective in restoring financial stability and preventing bank runs, while the interventions with public 
funds have had significant repercussions for both markets and the government balance sheets. Sovereign guarantees issued for banks' funding have been initially considered as a reflection of 
the implicit contingent liabilities of governments towards the financial sector. However, the 
prolongation of these explicit guarantee programmes in Europe and the US has raised discussions over 
their possible negative impacts on the risk and pricing mechanisms in financial markets 11 . The 
issuances of these government-backed bonds reached very high levels during 2009-2010 (Figure 2). Figure 2. Gross issuance of bank bonds in the euro area, the UK and the US Billions of Euro equivalents Source: Grande G, et al. (2011),  " Public Guarantees on Bank Bonds: Effectiveness and Distortions " , 
www.oecd.org/finance/financial-markets/49200208.pdf On the other hand, financial sector distress has created important effects on global capital 
movements and investment channels. Regulatory and restrictive measures taken to protect the 
financial system have led to a decrease in the risk appetite and willingness of banks to provide 
financing for infrastructure. The resulting financing gap has become an important issue for both 
developed and developing countries. In this environment, government guarantees, mostly taking the 
form of credit guarantees, have continued to be important tools of credit enhancement in infrastructure 
finance. On the other hand, in the framework of the PPP model of procurement, governments have 
increasingly resorted to the financial and other guarantees in order to increase the governments' share 
in project risks and thereby ensuring the projects'  " bankability 12  " . The global crisis has posed significant troubles for the small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs) as well. Work by the OECD 13 reveals that access to finance and lending conditions 
deteriorated for the SMEs after the crisis, especially during the period 2007-2010, generally 
accompanied by modest or no growth in credit volumes. Responding to these developments, 11 OECD has intensive work on financial sector guarantees since the 2008 global financial crisis available at 
www.oecd.org/finance/financialsectorguarantees.htm 12 A PPP project is bankable if lenders are willing to finance it (The EPEC PPP Guide). www.eib.org/epec/g2g/i-
project-identification/12/123/index.htm 13 See  " Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs: An OECD Scoreboard "  2013. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 13 governments designed new SME guarantee programmes generally in the form of credit guarantees 
provided under special programmes or expanded the existing ones in order to boost SME financing in 
the post-crisis environment 14 . There have been changes in the total amount of guarantee funds, the 
share of the loans guaranteed or the number and types of eligible firms aimed at increasing the 
government support. In addition, these programmes included some new elements or new instruments 
over the traditional guarantee programmes (OECD, 2013). In general, the main objective of these 
programmes has been to enhance the SMEs' access to credit, especially to bank lending. Figure 3 presents the increase in the level of contingent liabilities in the European context for the 
period 2007-2014. The data illustrate that in both the Euro Area (EA19) and the EU as a whole 
(EU28), there was significant increase in the stock of contingent liabilities in 2008 and 2009, before 
the gradual decrease in 2010 and 2011. The peak in 2009 reflects the large exposures of the European 
governments under the financial sector support programmes (in the form of guarantee schemes), and 
the subsequent decrease is largely the result of decreased exposures in Germany, Ireland, the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Eurostat, 2015). Figure 3. Level of contingent liabilities in the euro area and the EU 28 (2007-2014) Percentage of GDP Source: Eurostat Supplementary Table for the Financial Crisis -Background note (April 2015) 
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1015035/2022710/Background-note-fin-crisis-OCT-2015-final.pdf To summarise, the use of guarantees and other type of contingent liabilities by the governments 
have increased due to the global crisis. The areas where this increase was the most evident were; 
financial sector support, credit enhancement for infrastructure financing in traditional and PPP 
procurement models and the SME finance. Thus, the effective management and monitoring of 
contingent liabilities have become more important for governments. Against this backdrop, the following parts of this paper focus on main components of contingent 
liability management and the role of public debt managers. Part II includes the summary results of the 
OECD survey and analyses the role of public debt managers in three sub-categories of contingent 
liabilities. Part III is a summary of conclusions and recommendations. Annex A presents the case 
studies of seven task force members drafted by the DMOs of the member countries themselves. 14 According to a survey conducted by OECD Working Party on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises & 
Entrepreneurship (WPSMEE) on the Impact of the Global Crisis on SMEs and Entrepreneurship, 
 " creation and extension of loan guarantee schemes "  was a common policy response for all countries 
with only several exceptions. See OECD (2009). 14 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 PART 2. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS 
IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT The first section of this part presents the summary results of the OECD survey to provide readers 
with an overview of public debt managers' involvement in contingent liability management across 
countries. This part then analyses three categories of contingent liabilities; government credit 
guarantees, contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and government sponsored insurance programmes, 
and includes discussions on these policy areas from a PDM perspective. 2.1. Summary of the OECD survey results The OECD Bond Market and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a survey on the role of 
public debt managers in contingent liability management in late 2013 among 34 OECD Countries and 
2 non-OECD Countries (Brazil and South Africa). The survey questions were sent through e-mails to 
the authorities of DMOs and 31 OECD and 2 non-OECD countries responded to the survey. According to the survey results, out of the 33 DMOs, 22 indicated that they have some role in the 
management of contingent liabilities. Figure 4 illustrates this result as a percentage. Figure 4. The role of DMOs in contingent liability management The survey also provided information on the involvement of DMOs in contingent liabilities by 
the type of liabilities (Table 2). The results indicate that the government credit guarantees is the 
category of contingent liabilities with which DMOs mostly engage. Programme guarantees -also 
included within the category of credit guarantees in this paper – government sponsored insurance 
programmes and the PPP guarantees are areas that a majority of DMOs participated in the survey do 
not assume responsibilities at the management level. Yes

contingent liability management – measurement, monitoring and reporting. Monitoring and reporting 
roles of DMOs are more prominent when compared to the measurement in case of the credit 
guarantees. For the other types of contingent liabilities, the number of DMOs carrying these three 
functions is much less. The involvement of DMOs in the measurement, monitoring and reporting of 
contingent liabilities is slightly higher in every category when compared with their  " responsibility in 
management " . Table 3. Types of roles DMOs play in different areas of contingent liability management (*) Do you calculate

6 (*) The fields left blank by the countries were not counted as  " no "  in the table. As regards to the question about the possible effect of the global financial crisis on the role of the 
DMOs in contingent liability management; 13 countries mentioned some change in their role 
following the global crisis, and 9 of these countries linked this change to the support provided to the 
financial sector after the crisis (Figure 5). 16 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 Figure 5. The effect of the global financial crisis on the role of DMOs To summarise, the main findings of the OECD survey on the role of public debt managers in 
contingent liability management are:  Around two-thirds of the DMOs responding to the survey have some role in contingent 
liability management.  Government credit guarantees is the sub-category of contingent liabilities that the DMOs 
most actively engage.  Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and the government sponsored insurance 
programmes are the areas the public debt managers are not involved in management while a 
relatively small number of DMOs perform functions of measurement, monitoring and 
reporting in these areas as well.  From the perspective of public debt managers, the effect of the global financial crisis on their 
contingent liability management practices was largely through their increasing role in the 
financial sector support programmes initiated within the crisis environment. In the following sections, policy frameworks of government credit guarantees, contingent 
liabilities arising from PPPs and government insurance programmes will be discussed with their 
implications for public debt managers. 2.2. Government credit guarantees Government credit guarantees are the liabilities based on contracts through which the government 
assumes the whole or part of the credit risk of a loan extended to or a bond issued by another party. In 
this study, the term refers to the guarantees covering debt service obligations of the beneficiaries. Government credit guarantees are the most widely used explicit contingent liabilities in many 
countries and the results of the survey strongly supports this finding. Traditionally, this group 
consisted mainly of the individual guarantees provided for public institutions like public corporations 
or local governments, and for public or private development banks, mostly in the framework of their 
investment financing operations. In many developing countries, access to foreign financing sources by 
public institutions has been possible through the government guarantees provided on their foreign Change*

change is related to the guarantees provided to financial sector institutions . THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 17 loans. The alternative to these government guarantees is the on-lending, in which case, the government 
borrows directly from the lenders and on-lends the funds under the same or different terms to the 
beneficiary institutions by means of a separate agreement 15 . Programme or umbrella guarantees – labelled as programme loan guarantees in the survey-are 
usually provided for large groups of beneficiaries, as in guarantees on housing loans, student loans, 
export credits and the credits for SMEs. These guarantees are also debt service guarantees issued by 
the central governments. In most cases, programme guarantees are run by specialised agencies or 
institutions, as in the case of credit guarantee funds for SMEs or export credit agencies (ECAs) for the 
export credits. Considering the large number of beneficiaries involved, individual guarantee 
applications are dealt with within the programme parameters at the agency level, rather than at the 
central government level (such as the ministry of finance or treasury). Guarantees issued by the governments for the bonds of the commercial banks in response to the 
financial crisis can also be evaluated as some form of government credit guarantees. As these 
guarantees were in the form of contractual guarantees, they are by definition explicit, irrespective of 
whether they were issued on some (until then) implicit commitments. 16 . From the government's perspective, motivation for credit guarantee issuance is a function of its 
political and economic priorities and might change over time, depending on the developments in the 
domestic market and at the global level. For example, when boosting real sector development becomes 
a priority, guaranteed SME credits might be formulated, or in a financial crisis environment, bond 
guarantees are brought to the table to ease the banking sector distress. The main objective of the 
government in using credit guarantees as a financial instrument is, in general terms, to provide 
incentives for the market to finance certain institutions, activities or projects. By taking over the credit 
risk of the borrower, access to more funding from the lenders or investors is assured or the terms of the 
financing is ameliorated. Thus, the principal rationale is the same in different sub-categories of credit 
guarantees. For credit guarantees to be economically justified, however, they must bring advantages 
that outweigh these drawbacks. Each proposed guarantee (or programme) has to be evaluated on its 
own merits, including a careful evaluation of alternative solutions. Role of public debt managers The results of the survey show that compared to other forms of contingent liabilities, the area of 
government credit guarantees is the one with which debt managers are the most actively engaged. 
Public debt managers are involved in different phases of guarantee issuance; from assessing the credit 
guarantee proposals, to monitoring and managing the credit guarantee portfolios and programmes. The 
survey responses also indicate that DMOs were responsible for the management of the financial sector 
guarantee programmes, initiated in the European countries during the global financial crisis. 15 The OECD (2005) provides a comparative analysis of credit guarantees and on-lending and concludes that 
credit guarantees have two drawbacks relative to direct lending. First and foremost, guaranteed debt 
has higher funding costs. For a guarantee to a government-owned entity or for a subsidised guarantee, 
this additional cost is borne by the government. Second, guarantees may entail higher financial risks, 
in particular if the borrower is able to set and implement its own financing policy. Such risks are 
transferred to the government as guarantor. To counteract such behaviour, the guaranteed borrowers 
must be subjected to monitoring, an activity which in itself is costly. The Annex A.2 on Denmark also 
includes an analysis of credit guarantees versus on-lending. 16 Levy, A. and Schich, S (2010) and Grande G, et al. (2011) provide detailed analysis on the financial sector support programs involving government guarantees to bank bonds. 18 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 Assessment of credit guarantee proposals In case of individual (non-programme) credit guarantees, the criteria to be met by the applying 
institutions should be set clearly thereby the initial assessment for the guarantee eligibility becomes an 
easy task. This can be done by the front or mid office of DMO, or the related department of 
Treasury/Ministry of Finance, where the application is submitted, or the sponsoring ministry in more 
decentralised jurisdictions. More importantly, assessment of a credit guarantee at the application stage requires a further 
quantitative analysis of the proposed guarantee at hand, revealing its potential costs and risks to the 
government. Ideally, the net cost/net benefit should be quantified through a cost-benefit analysis of the 
guarantee proposal though it is often difficult to quantify the benefits of a guarantee. In this regard, the 
guarantee should be valued and priced ex ante based on its expected and actual (mostly administrative) 
costs and risks, based on different contingent liability measures, with two initial purposes:  inform the political decision-making body about the costs and risks of the guarantee before a 
decision is made for its issuance  determine the level of fee to be charged from the beneficiary. Operationally, these two analyses can be done in one stage or in two separate stages. The 
quantitative analysis should inform and supplement the eventually political decision to be taken by the 
legislature, cabinet or the minister, depending on the legal framework in place in a country. This 
information should also be provided in a way to enable the decision-maker to compare between the 
credit guarantee with other instruments like direct lending or subsidies in terms of its costs. For 
example, the risk assessment conducted by the State Guarantee Fund (SGF) of Iceland, which is the 
body within the Government Debt Management division of Central Bank, is submitted to the 
Parliament for the latter to decide if a financial subsidy should be provided instead of a guarantee. 
Ultimately, the policymaking body decides whether to issue the guarantee or not. A guarantee can be 
issued for political reasons or certain policy purposes even when the cost of a guarantee is relatively 
high. According to the results of the OECD Survey, there are differences among countries in decision-
making frameworks for issuing credit guarantees, but political decision-making supported by a 
quantitative assessment/evaluation of guarantee terms exists in many countries (Table 4). THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 19 Table 4. Examples of credit guarantee issuance frameworks Country

cover the expected cost (or a higher fee to 
comply with international agreements). Turkey

Treasury has the authority to issue 
government credit guarantees, within 
the nominal limits set by the 
Parliament through the annual budget 
law. Credit Risk Management Department within

an internal model at each credit guarantee 
application. After the decision is made, the fee 
is calculated by using the same model. Source: OECD 2013 Survey on the Role of Debt Managers in Contingent Liability Management 20 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 In some cases, debt managers are given the mandate to perform the quantitative analysis both at 
the proposal assessment stage of the credit guarantees and for managing the portfolio (which will be 
discussed later). Public debt managers tend to have a broad perspective on government finances, thus 
they may be expected to make unbiased assessments of the costs and risks. Their general financial and 
economic expertise may also be helpful in making the analyses necessary to determine an appropriate 
fee. On the other hand, guarantee pricing requires capacity development in credit and project 
evaluation, and financial statement analysis to calculate default probabilities of institutions. These 
areas of expertise are not searched for in conventional debt management. Conducting default analysis 
of different types of institutions; SOEs, local administrations, public banks, and private investment 
banks, etc. might be challenging and requires a credit risk management function to be established 
within the debt management offices. Hiring credit risk specialists (the SNDO in Sweden and SGF in 
Iceland) or using a tailor-made credit rating model designed by credit risk management specialists 
hired for this purpose (Turkish Treasury) might be considered as other solutions, which enable 
tackling with these challenges. In case of programme guarantees, which are usually authorised by the parliaments and involve 
many borrowers, additional aspects should be considered. Common practice is that the governments 
administer these guarantee programmes through specialised agencies and institutions – such as ECAs, 
credit guarantee funds/corporations specialized in SME guarantees, housing funds or agencies 
providing student loan guarantees -rather than assigning their management to DMOs. For efficient 
public financial management, these programmes should have clearly stated objectives and a set of 
rules for granting specific types of guarantees in order to provide the framework in which the unit 
responsible for issuance of these guarantees operates. In countries where centralised risk management 
function is performed by DMOs, the expected costs and risks of these guarantees should be taken into 
account in their overall risk assessment. Contract Design Credit guarantee contracts should be formulated in such a way as to clearly identify the scope and 
the terms of the guarantee. Governments limit the guarantees they issue, in time and amount for fiscal 
risk management purposes. For example,  " The Guidelines of Borrowing and Risk Management "  of 
Denmark stipulates that loan types must be customary, i.e. known and used in the market by reputed 
borrowers and loans must be built up from simple elements that make them transparent (plain vanilla 
products), to be eligible for guarantees " . To give another example, in Swedish legal framework, it is 
envisaged that any guarantee undertaking must include contractual terms that limit the state's risk and 
ensures that the state has appropriate rights to monitor and control the risk. Guarantee agreement between the lender and the government and the loan agreement between the 
lender and the borrower institution are parts of the same financial package. There is usually a third 
agreement (or protocol) between the government and the borrower regulating mostly the fee charging 
and recovery issues. Being as such, the terms of these agreements are highly correlated including 
cross-references to each other. The governments should play an active role in drafting the whole 
package of agreements to ensure proper clauses are in place regarding issues such as:  collateral and counter-guarantee (if there are any)  guarantee fee and administrative costs to be charged from the borrower  rules and procedures to be followed when the guarantee is called  financial and information sharing obligations of the lender and the borrower towards the government as the guarantor THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 21  sanctions for noncompliance  case of default and the step-in conditions of the government as the guarantor  recovery (collection procedures of the government pay-outs), etc. The level of involvement of debt managers in the contract design and negotiations depends on the 
institutional framework for the issuance of credit guarantees. In countries where DMO has the 
authority to issue the guarantees, it is naturally involved with the contract drafting, negotiation and 
execution processes as the contracting party. However, in decentralized structures where the 
institutions other than the debt management office/Treasury/Ministry of Finance have the authority to 
issue guarantees such a direct involvement might not be the case. Risk management of the credit guarantee portfolio Risk management of the credit guarantee portfolio is a crucial function of governments meaning 
in simple terms, taking necessary measures to monitor and mitigate the fiscal risks posed by the 
already issued guarantees. The most common risk management tools employed by countries are: i) a 
limit or ceiling over the guarantee issuance or stock ii) a contingency reserve fund iii) partial guarantee 
issuance, iv) portfolio monitoring and v) disclosure and reporting. Countries with strong capacity in managing risks of their direct debt portfolio are in a better 
position to perform this function over their guaranteed debt portfolio. Well-structured DMOs may 
expand their areas of responsibility to cover the risk management of contingent debt alongside the 
direct debt, enabling an integrated portfolio approach to risk management. For example, the Irish Debt 
Management Agency (NTMA) has evolved from a single function agency to the manager of a 
complex portfolio of public assets and liabilities. Likewise, the New Zealand DMO has recently 
assumed the role to monitor contingent liabilities as part of the responsibility of managing the Crown 
Balance Sheet. In April 2013, the DMO acquired the Balance Sheet Monitoring unit within the New 
Zealand Treasury, playing a more influential role in the management of contingent liabilities. Across the countries applying limits, the types and scope change. Some countries apply an overall 
limit for all the contingent liabilities or even direct debt and contingent debt together, while in some 
others credit guarantees, guarantees issued under certain programmes (like bond guarantees for the 
banks), under the PPP frameworks, etc. are subject to separate ceilings. The scope of the limit might 
apply to the central government issuances or be extended to cover the general government. Some 
examples of guarantee limits are given in Table 5. Another issue is whether to limit the government's exposure to the credit risk of a single 
institution, in order to confine the concentration risk of the portfolio. Within well-established 
frameworks where the applications are filtered through a process in which the creditworthiness of the 
applicant is measured and reflected on the guarantee fee, concentration risk might not be regarded as a 
major concern. However, where the incentivising motives of the government is high, issuing large 
amounts of guarantees to certain institutions continuously, even when there is an overall limit might 
increase the risk on the government's side. In jurisdictions where parliamentary approval is a rule for each guarantee issuance, limiting the 
exposure might be less of a concern than in those where guarantee decisions are taken at the 
ministerial, cabinet or separate authority level. Limiting the credit risk exposure by limiting the duration of certain guarantee programmes 
designed for exceptional circumstances is also recommended in order to avoid moral hazard and 
prevent the government support through guarantees to be regarded as a normal way of business. For 22 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 example, our survey results indicate that the government guaranteed bank bonds issued after the global 
crisis were designed to be limited in time and amount. When the guarantee limit is set and revised annually, the calculation of the limit to be applied for 
the subsequent year should be based on the valuation of the existing guarantee portfolio and the 
pipeline of new projects and activities together. Thus, limit-setting exercise could also be an area of 
involvement for the debt managers, which might be regarded as a side work of guarantee valuation. Table 5. Examples of guarantee limits applied in countries Country

as an area linked with guarantee valuation and portfolio management. Fund management involves 
monitoring the revenues (fees and collections from past pay-outs) and expenses (pay-outs for 
guarantees called) of the fund (generally back offices in debt management offices are good candidates THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 23 to perform this function), managing fund's assets and calculating the need for budgetary allocations 
when the fund resources fall short. Table 6. Country examples of reserve funds Country 
Reserve fund South Africa 
South Africa does not currently have a reserve fund, but one of the mandates of the FLC is to 
consider the introduction of a funded contingency reserve account. Sweden 
Each responsible authority keeps a  " notional reserve account "  at the SNDO. There is an 
unlimited credit linked to each reserve. A call on state guarantee is booked against the 
applicable nominal reserve and the resulting payment is charged against the Treasury Single 
Account. In addition, the fees and recoveries are recorded in these nominal accounts and then 
transferred into the central government revenues to decrease the SNDO's borrowing 
requirement. Turkey Turkish contingency reserve account (called  " risk account " ) was established in 2003 at the 
Central Bank with the purpose of funding needs arising from of the credit guarantees. It is an 
actual and off-budgetary fund. The revenues of the fund consist of the collections from past 
pay-outs, guarantee/on-lent fees and interest income. If these revenues do not meet the need 
for undertakings, budgetary allocation for the risk account is utilised. USA 
Loan guarantees fund in USA is an example of notional reserve funds. It is an off-budget fund 
where the beneficiaries or the sponsoring departments pay the fees for guarantees. The 
transactions of these accounts are presented in budget documents. Source: OECD 2013 Survey on the Role of Debt Managers in Contingent Liability Management, Cebotari (2009) Issuance of partial credit guarantees, i.e. providing guarantee coverage for a percentage of the 
debt service obligations of the beneficiary, is a useful tool to establish a risk sharing arrangement 
between the government and the lender. Through leaving a certain portion of the loan or bond 
uncovered, the government can ensure that lender or investor carry some credit risk as well. Another 
tool to provide partiality is obliging the guarantee beneficiary to provide some part of the total 
financing for the project/activity in question. In Turkey, for example, Treasury repayment guarantees are provided for up to 95% of 
repayments of the agreed credit amount. Partial guarantee does not apply to the loans from 
international and regional organisations, foreign government funds, and export credits provided by the 
official export insurance agencies of foreign countries; because of their concessional terms compared 
with commercial loans. In Iceland, this ratio is limited to 75% of the credit amount. In addition, the 
guarantee recipient is required to provide at least 20% of the total financing for the project. In Canada, 
lender-risk sharing is ensured by leaving 15% of the default risk to the lenders. 24 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 Centralisation of the risk management function requires close monitoring of the portfolio, which 
is possible only by having access to information on the existing guarantees. Portfolio monitoring has 
two legs in general:  monitoring of the disbursements and payments under the instrument on which the credit 
guarantee is established, and  monitoring the financials of the beneficiary to be informed about its financial health in order 
to assess its ability to service guaranteed debt Regarding the first one, the survey results show that in many OECD countries DMO is the place 
where data on existing guarantees are gathered even if it is not the issuer of some of those guarantees. 
The debt manager might use the data collected for the following purposes: 
 valuation of the existing portfolio to assess fiscal risks that the central government is 
exposed 
 informing the related bodies or parties (the Parliament, Cabinet, Finance Minister etc. ) about 
such risks 
 using the guarantee information as an input in debt sustainability analysis (see section below)  publishing the information on the web-site  publishing the information as part of debt management reporting. Institutional arrangements should be made in such a way as to make the data collection easier. In 
South Africa, for example, the data on utilisation from the existing guarantees are collated by the 
ALM Division (Credit Risk Directorate) of Treasury to be able to make overall risk based assessments 
of the portfolio and to produce recommendations to the FLC on a quarterly basis. Establishing a 
special guarantee-monitoring unit within DMO might also be useful. In Turkey, there is a separate 
division within the Treasury back office to monitor the guarantee portfolio, while the credit risk 
department in the middle office conducts the portfolio risk assessments. The flow of information to 
this monitoring unit might be direct or indirect through the fiscal reporting, which must be provided by 
the individual agencies to the Ministry of Finance. Portfolio monitoring at the central level should ideally cover the whole portfolio of explicit 
contingent liabilities in which the portfolio of credit guarantees constitutes the most prominent part in 
most of the countries. As regards to the disclosure and reporting, both quantitative and qualitative information on credit 
guarantees should be disclosed based on their expected costs and in such a way as to give a complete 
picture of the government's total financial position, both as part of debt management reporting and 
budgetary documentation. Countries have different practices in credit guarantee disclosure and reporting, both as regards to 
the content of the data they disclose and to the forms of disclosure (web reporting, budget document, 
separate periodical report, etc.) (Table 7). THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 25 Table 7. Disclosure practices of selected countries Country

Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs The use of the PPP model of procurement for realizing public investment projects has a long 
history as an alternative method to traditional public procurement. The PPP model is described by the 
OECD Principles (2012) as  " …long term contractual arrangements between the government and a 
private partner whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the 
associated risks "  17 . Despite significant benefits offered by PPPs, most important one being the employment of private 
sector's efficiency and resources for the purpose of delivering public services, there are yet many 
challenges posed by this model. Most importantly, the complexity of the model necessitates skilful 
management on the public side, which brings about certain capacity building issues. The IMF warns that PPPs might entail significant fiscal risks, and draws attention to the actions 
to help mitigate these fiscal risks. Strengthening the legal provisions affecting PPPs, strengthening the 
management and oversight frameworks, achieving full and transparent disclosure of all fiscal risks and 
fully integrating the accounting for and reporting of PPPs in the medium-term budget process are the 
actions that the IMF recommends (IMF 2014). Cash flows generated by PPPs are generally quite different from those under the traditional public 
procurement. It might require less public money during the initial years of the contracts, as the 
investment is usually financed by private equity and finance. This perception makes PPPs relatively 
more attractive to governments, especially to ones with fiscal constraints. However, when the fiscal 
costs of the public investment are analysed over the life of the project, the choice for a PPP might not 
be justified. While the rise in the interest for PPPs in recent years is evident, the available data suggests that 
there have been considerable falls in the number of PPP deals in the aftermath of the crisis, especially 
in Europe, as the access to long term private financing sources has become more difficult (Figure 7) 18 . 17 As also noted in the OECD Principles, there is no commonly agreed definition of the PPPs, different 
definitions are used by different international institutions and countries. The fact that there are a 
variety of models under the  " PPP "  category with specific ownership structures makes agreement over 
a unified definition more difficult. 18 January 2010 Survey by the OECD, presented in  " How to Attain Value for Money "  THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 27 The collapse of the monoline 19 industry due to the crisis, which was important in providing financial 
guarantees over bonds issued by project companies to finance PPPs, and the new and more restrictive 
Basel III capital requirements for banks; are some of the factors exacerbating the limitations of private 
investment finance. In recent years, direct and contingent commitments provided by the governments under the PPP 
frameworks have been sought for more and more by the private sector companies and lenders. The 
European Public Private Partnership Expertise Centre (EPEC) confirms this trend by noting  " Limited 
liquidity in the PPP financing markets, increased risk aversion of lenders and sponsors and a higher 
cost of capital have led governments to take a more active role in providing direct and indirect 
financial support to PPP programmes. So far, government support has often been provided through 
financing non-government partners' capital costs, granting extensive guarantees to creditors as well as 
agreeing to more generous PPP contract termination clauses "  (EPEC, 2010). However, as data 
availability on the contingent commitments embedded in PPP contracts is very limited, it is not 
possible to show this rising trend across countries 20,21 . It should also be noted that the current low 
interest rate environment in the international financial markets is a factor boosting investors' 
willingness to finance PPPs, which might result in a reduced need for the government guarantees 
aiming at credit enhancement in the coming years. Figure 6. European PPP market by value and number of projects Source: EPEC (2016), Market Update, Review of the European PPP Market in 2015, 
www.eib.org/epec/library/epec_market_update_2015_en2 19  " Monoline industry "  involved companies which are called  " monolines "  because, although they are legally 
licensed and organised as insurance companies, they are permitted by law to offer only one form of 
insurance – financial guarantees – as opposed to other insurance companies which may offer various 
insurance products and are called  " multi-line "  insurers (EPEC 2010). 20 Eurostat data covers PPPs from 2010 onwards but the data is on  " adjusted capital value of balance PPPs " , not 
the specific contingent liabilities involved. 21 According to a 2009 Survey conducted by Philippe Burger, Justin Tyson, Izabela Karpowicz, and Maria 
Delgado Coelho as discussed in  " The Effects of the Financial Crisis on Public-Private Partnerships " , 
half of the respondents saw the key VfM criteria for new projects changing—specifically, private 
partners in PPPs were less willing to retain certain risks, such as interest rate risk and financial closure 
risk and were seeking greater contributions or guarantees from the government. 28 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 Types of contingent liabilities in PPPs For the purposes of this report, PPP contingent liabilities cover those contingent commitments, 
which are based on contracts 22 signed by the central government institutions for PPPs. The non-
contractual or implicit PPP liabilities, which are materialized mostly when the politically important 
projects are bailed out by the governments, or when the governments have to renegotiate PPP 
contracts, are outside the scope of this report. On the other hand, direct fiscal commitments of governments under the PPPs; like up-front 
capital contributions or availability payments of governments committed during the life of the project 
are not covered because these are not contingent but direct liabilities of the governments. However, it 
is important to acknowledge that these long-term direct fiscal commitments are also important sources 
of fiscal risk and should be monitored closely for ensuring fiscal sustainability. Within this context, the main contingent liabilities under PPPs are:  credit and refinancing guarantees extended to the project companies under which the 
government guarantees the lenders that it will service their debt if the PPP company fails to 
do so.  revenue guarantees, where the government guarantees the project company a certain level of 
usage of the services to be provided by the latter.  exchange rate guarantees, which means the government assumes the exchange risk of the 
project company, usually when the project's main cash flows are denominated in a foreign 
currency.  termination payments, which are government commitments to pay the project company a 
certain amount in case the contract terminates prematurely, where the principle is that this 
amount corresponds to the value of the project assets, but in some cases the government 
commits to pay a certain portion of the debt outstanding to the lenders  debt assumption commitments, where the government agrees to assume the debt obligations 
of the project company in case the PPP contract is terminated. Compared to the terminations 
payments, the debt assumption commitments are towards the lenders, not the project 
company.  guarantees extended to the commitments provided by non-sovereigns (non-sovereign 
creditworthiness guarantees), which aim at increasing the creditworthiness of commitments 
provided by non-central government entities. Table 8 provides examples of these various types of contingent liabilities by the countries that use 
them in their PPP contracts. It is also useful to distinguish between different layers of direct fiscal commitments and 
guarantees provided under PPPs (Aslan and Duarte, 2014). Grantor or procuring public institutions 22 The main contract signed under the PPP models is the implementation contract between the procuring 
institution and the project company, which is usually called  " the PPP contract " . There are other 
contracts and sub-contracts regulating mainly the credit, hedging, insurance, construction, operation 
and maintenance issues signed between the related PPP players. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 29 can themselves provide some forms of direct fiscal commitments or guarantees to the project 
companies or the creditors for various project risks, depending on the authority given to them by the 
domestic PPP legislations. The second layer of guarantees are provided by the central government 
authority/financial authority (ministries of finance or national treasuries in most cases) to support the 
first level of commitments or provide additional guarantee coverage for certain risks. Aslan and 
Duarte highlight the importance of ensuring coordination between these two levels of institutions 
considering that the implementing institutions would be more prone to take risks to accomplish their 
investment agenda than the finance ministry/treasury, which would be more cautious about the impact 
of these contingent liabilities on the central government budget and debt sustainability. Table 8. Examples of state guarantees in PPPs Country

been initiated in response to the global crisis, such as the debt instrument in France, refinancing 
guarantee in Belgium and loan guarantees in Portugal (EPEC 2011). 30 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 PPP Governance OECD Principles for Public Governance of Public Private Partnerships 23 (2012) maps out the key 
players and their responsibilities in PPPs (Table 9). The OECD recommends that there should be a 
body at the central government level approving the PPPs, and this approval decision should be taken 
based on sufficient information on the costs and risks of the project. OECD also advises that in order 
to avoid conflict of interest, the unit promoting the PPP and the unit approving the investment decision 
should be separated. The approving agency should have an understanding of the government's fiscal 
situation and an interest in maintaining prudent fiscal policy. Institutional set-ups for PPP governance differ widely across countries. In some countries there is 
no PPP unit performing the functions that are recommended by the OECD. 24 PPPs are long-term 
contracts calling for strong project management and monitoring skills not only within the private 
parties but also on the side of governments. As part of this broader context, the monitoring and 
management of long term PPP contingent commitments should also be an area of concern for the 
governments and be dealt with at the central government level. Table 9. Key players and their roles in PPP Governance Procuring authority Responsible for the project, including the preparation,

information about different country practices in PPP governance with or without established PPP 
units. 25 There are different definitions of the concept  " value for money "  in the literature; OECD Principles (2012) 
defines it as  " the optimal combination of quality, features and price, calculated over the whole of the 
project's life. 26 A recent World Bank study by Aslan and Duarte (2014) refers to this authority as  " Financial authority "  with 
the same roles assigned. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 31 Implications for public debt management From a public debt manager's perspective, explicit PPP guarantees of various forms listed above 
are not different from the government credit guarantees discussed in the previous section, in terms of 
their relationship with and potential impacts on public debt and central government budget. However, 
the OECD Survey results indicate that public debt managers are much less involved in the 
management of PPP guarantees than they are with the credit guarantees. Among the 18 countries that 
responded to the question  " Is the DMO responsible in the management of the PPP explicit contingent 
liabilities at any level? "  only Turkey responded  " Yes " . This distance observed in practice between the 
PPP contingent liabilities and public debt managers is difficult to justify. Indeed, there is policy areas 
in which the debt managers might be effectively involved. The PPP decision as a model of procurement should be based on a value for money analysis, 
implying that the PPP choice should be proven superior to the traditional procurement model from the 
public party's perspective. Although quantitative value for money analysis might have differences in 
methodology 27 , it is essential to include the estimated fiscal costs of the project into the calculations. 
This exercise involves taking into account of the PPP guarantees from the very beginning, as these 
guarantees change the risk sharing between the public and the private parties. Thus, guarantee 
valuation should be considered as a critical component of the PPP decision-making. On the other 
hand, value for money analysis should not only be conducted ex-ante but also ex-post, in order to 
ensure that it is maintained throughout the life of the project. Given this framework, Table 10 includes suggestions for the public debt managers' possible 
involvement into the PPP processes. The roles suggested might not be relevant for DMOs of some 
countries in which case it is highly recommended to have another central government institution 
performing the listed functions for better management of fiscal risks arising from PPPs. Indeed, the 
interventions suggested for the public debt managers in the below table can be considered as 
complementing the role to be played by the  " central budget authority "  in the OECD Principles. Public 
debt manager's risk management and mitigation abilities might well complement budget authority's 
perspective of fiscal affordability. In jurisdictions where specialized PPP units exist, their role should 
be considered as complementing that of procuring institutions, rather than the central budget authority. 27 See World Bank (2013) and Burger and Hawkesworth (2011) for detailed information on value for money and 
country practices. 32 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 Before the PPP decision is made

budgetary documentation THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 33 Regardless of the issuer institution of the PPP guarantees, the effective management and 
mitigation of fiscal risks arising from the existing PPP portfolio calls for the following functions to be 
performed by the related government units:  undertaking scenario analysis and stress tests  providing estimates of expected and maximum losses from the portfolio to analyse fiscal 
sustainability of central government over medium to long term  providing estimates of expected and maximum losses from the portfolio to analyse debt 
sustainability of central government over medium to long term  applying ceilings on contingent liabilities from PPPs to promote fiscal discipline. Transparency Transparency of contingent liabilities increases the likelihood that these liabilities are taken on 
for sound reasons and it helps eliminate the bias toward them. Transparency is particularly important 
in the framework of PPPs, as the governments might be inclined more towards the PPPs if the costs 
and risks are managed in a non-transparent way. Raising the awareness of the long-term fiscal impact of PPPs is important for governments and 
they can disclose information on PPPs regardless of the complexity of their budgetary, accounting, and 
statistical standards. This information could include supplementary statistics that provide medium-and 
long-term forecasts of PPP spending and revenue, descriptions of the contracts and their fiscal costs 
and risks, and the contracts themselves (Funke, K et al., 2013). Contingent liabilities under PPPs, in 
this context, are among the critical information to be disclosed as major source of fiscal risk. DMOs can work together with the central budget authority in data consolidation, forecasting and 
reporting practices on the PPP contingent liabilities; or include this information in their debt reporting. 
The degree of the public debt managers' involvement in disclosure is a function of the PPP legislative 
frameworks in countries, which determine their access to the related data. 2.4. 
Government sponsored insurance programmes Government insurance programmes are another major source of explicit contingent liabilities. 
They are special programmes providing insurance coverage for low frequency but high impact events 
like bank failures, floods, earthquakes, terrorist activities, etc., where the form and amount of 
government support or intervention are pre-described explicitly by law. Not surprisingly, these 
insurance programme areas coincide with the sources of large implicit contingent liabilities for 
governments; financial system, terrorist activities, catastrophic events and environmental disasters. In 
other words, government sponsored insurance programmes should be considered as ex ante financial 
measures aimed at increasing governments' readiness for and protection against losses expected from 
certain disastrous events. In some insurance schemes, government plays directly the role of an insurance provider (self-
insurance) while in others it might choose to purchase insurance from the private insurance companies 
(market insurance). In the latter case, the event risk is transferred to the private sector while the risk 
premiums are paid out of the government budget without creating any explicit contingent liability but 
direct commitments. However, there are various different forms of government insurance schemes 
falling between self-insurance and market insurance, depending on the source of risk, availability of 
market for providing insurance against this risk and the policy objectives of the government. 34 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 Government deposit insurance Government deposit insurance is one of the most important and widely applied mechanisms in 
this category 28,29 . Major purposes of the deposit insurance systems are, to offer consumer protection 
and to reduce the risks of bank runs in case of banking failures, runs that can trigger systemic crises. Table 11 summarizes the main characteristics of deposit insurance systems in the OECD 
countries based on the database provided by Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2014). In almost all of the OECD 
countries, there exist explicit deposit insurance systems (the exceptions are Israel and New Zealand). 
In terms of the administration of the deposit insurance system, the common practice is to have a 
separate legal entity. This entity is administered publicly, privately or jointly in different country 
cases. The funding source of the system is private in most of the OECD countries; the exceptions 
being Australia and Chile which have government funded insurance systems and in Portugal where the 
system is funded jointly between the public and private sources. In most OECD countries, deposit 
insurance systems are run through a fund into which the premiums paid by the banks are pooled ex 
ante (there are several countries with ex post structures). In other words, the deposit insurance system 
is financed by the banks themselves 30 . The insurance coverage provided might be limited based on deposit types, amounts or eligible 
institutions or unlimited covering all the deposits within the banking system. In some cases, the 
insurance coverage is set to be unlimited temporarily, as was the case in some OECD countries during 
the global crisis. Governments sometimes envisage in legislation some contingency plans even if the 
source of funding in the deposit insurance system is not government, considering the possibility that 
the deposit fund reserves available might fall short during the times of bank failures. This  " backstop "  
might take the form of pre-approved credit lines from the Treasury, or the institution managing the 
deposit fund might issue bonds or receive loans guaranteed by the government. 28 Some authors classify deposit insurance among financial guarantees rather than under insurance schemes, 
considering that these are guarantees covering banks' payment obligations towards their depositors in 
case of bank failure. 29 In Annex A, deposit insurance systems of Turkey, South Africa, Mexico and Sweden are explained in detail. 30 For detailed information about deposit insurance systems in different countries see Demirgüç-Kunt et al.

https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp14118.pdf Implications for public debt management The ability and credibility of governments, especially of the ones with relatively less fiscal space, 
in meeting their promises under the deposit insurance systems is an issue, because the maximum 
exposure loss (cash flow at risk) is relatively high considering the level of covered deposits within the 
financial system. Country experiences suggest that during systemic banking crisis, deposit insurance 
fund resources coming from the banks themselves usually fall short of the arising funding needs, 
compelling governments to deploy central government resources and debt financing, mostly in the 
form of bond issuances by DMOs or by the deposit insurance institutions, which are backed 
(guaranteed) by the central government. The fiscal costs of systemic banking crisis might be so high that it takes years of collaboration 
between the debt management offices and the deposit insurance institution to pay out or roll over the 
related financial liabilities. In this regard, Mexico is a good example: the 1995 crisis left the deposit 
insurance institution (IPAB) with a stock of liabilities funded from the markets through bond issuances 
guaranteed by the Mexican Congress. The fiscal burden of the Tequila crisis still continues and 
necessitates coordination between the DMO and the IPAB in the bond markets 20 years after the 
crisis. Turkey is yet another example of such an experience in which case it took almost 10 years to 
redeem the securities issued to back the deposit insurance system. The involvement by the public debt managers in this governance area is rather limited given the 
special expertise and mandate required for their management. In the survey results among the 18 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 37 DMOs who responded, it is only the SNDO having a mandate in the management of government 
deposit insurance programmes. On the other hand, the SNDO performs this function separately from 
its PDM functions. However, public debt managers can work with deposit insurance manager 
institution and financial system regulators in the field of contingent liabilities under deposit insurance 
systems to promote strategic risk taking and risk mitigation. In this context, the following key policies 
can be suggested:  clear legislative frameworks defining the scope and nature of government's role within the 
system – as insurer/guarantor/liquidity provider  effective reserve management (in ex ante fund structures) with risk based premium systems  effective and regular coordination and consultation with deposit insurance managers and 
financial system regulators over the fiscal risks arising from the financial system. Other insurance programmes in which governments are involved are mainly disaster risk 
insurance programmes designed for losses from catastrophic events and natural disasters 31 . During the 
last decades, the incidence of catastrophic events, especially those related with climate has increased 
steadily causing large fiscal costs for governments. In parallel with this increase, governments' 
involvement in the catastrophe risk insurance programmes, especially in developed countries, has 
amplified. In several countries, governments are involved in insurance programmes mainly due to lack of 
insurance coverage in the private market or unavailability of affordable insurance for the related 
segments of the society. Governments that experienced large-scale catastrophes with high disaster 
relief costs in the past are also more prone to design insurance frameworks. Insurance programmes are one of the instruments providing ex ante financing solutions for 
governments in disaster risk management. Other ex-ante financial sources are budget contingencies, 
reserve funds, contingent debt facilities and catastrophe bonds; while ex-post sources include donor 
assistance, budgetary reallocations, domestic and external credits and tax incomes. Governments need to analyse their risk bearing capacity before engaging in such insurance 
programmes. This analysis includes assessments of government's fiscal position, budgetary flexibility, 
public debt sustainability, as well as the ability to have access to financing resources in the post 
disaster conditions. This exercise is combined with the technical assessment of the probability of event 
occurring. If the disaster risk is minor and the risk bearing capacity is high, ex post solutions would be 
more rational for some governments (G20/OECD, 2012) 32 . When the insurance is deemed necessary, governments can get involved in this process in various 
ways. The appropriate role for the government would depend on the programme features, policy 
objectives, and the extent to which the government plans to assume the costs of the disaster risk 
covered. 31 Another important area is  " Terrorism Risk Insurance " , for information on OECD governments' involvement in 
terrorism risk insurance programmes see http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/insurance/Terrorism-Risk-
Insurance-Country-Comparison%207%20april%202015.pdf 32 Disaster Deficit Index (DDI) produced by the Inter-American Development Bank is a useful tool to measure 
the financial vulnerability of governments against natural disasters. For details see

Framework, www.oecd.org/gov/risk/G20disasterriskmanagement.pdf THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 39 In the case of self-insurance (direct insurer) solutions, public reserve fund applications are quite 
common practice, which are similar to contingency reserve funds discussed under the government 
credit guarantees section. National Calamity Fund in Colombia, Environmental Contingency Fund of 
U.S., and Natural Disaster Fund in Mexico are yet several examples of many. Although they are 
regarded as useful risk mitigation tools, as in the case of actual funds for credit guarantees, there is a 
cost attached to holding a cash fund with the expectation of a future natural disaster. Governments are also involved in insurance programmes by explicitly guaranteeing a part of the 
liabilities to occur under the programme. These guarantees usually take the form of backstop 
arrangements under deposit insurance, or guarantees provided under PPPs, in the sense that they are 
forms of risk sharing with the private sector while increasing the credibility of the system in covering 
the anticipated future losses. There might be a layered approach with private insurers or funds, i.e. 
damages are covered by the market until a certain threshold amount for the government guarantee to 
be called. Implications for public debt management The G20/OECD Methodological Framework for Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Financing 
(2012) explains the appropriate role of finance ministries in disaster risk management and financing 
frameworks as:  " Finance Ministries have a key role in ensuring an effective approach to the financial 
management of disaster risks – promoting the role of risk financing markets where feasible, ensuring 
the proper design of any market interventions, considering the development of public financial aid 
arrangements and programmes as a complement to any private compensation mechanisms and 
engaging in sound fiscal management of government contingent liabilities. Being centrally placed to 
affect the financial sector, budget making and the provision of financial guarantees, Finance Ministries 
have the responsibility to ensure that financial strategies for DRM are well integrated, efficient and 
effective. At a time when many countries are facing severe financial constraints, identifying the source 
of potential contingent liabilities and providing ex ante frameworks for managing them contributes to 
more robust public finances in the long term. Finance Ministries also have an important stake in 
ensuring the quality and policy relevance of country risk assessments and strengthening their own 
input into the risk assessment process as a means to ensure the development of cost-effective DRM 
strategies and financial strategies " . Following from this framework policy recommendations, contingent liabilities arising from 
government insurance programmes are among the areas where centralised fiscal risk management 
function of the government would be useful. As part of this function, public debt managers can be 
consulted in developing financing strategies and guarantees under these programmes, including the 
stage where the need for such ex ante programmes are assessed. From the perspective of public debt 
managers, government insurance as an ex ante source of risk financing would seem preferable over ex 
post search for funds when the disasters are realised. However, this preference might not be that 
straightforward as country specific and programme specific cost-risk analysis might prove ex-post 
solutions less costly. Thus, analyses involving finance ministries and DMOs are highly recommended 
before enrolling governments in these programmes with direct and contingent fiscal commitments by 
the governments. 40 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 PART 3. SUMMARY OF POLICY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Policy conclusions and recommendations This paper examines the role of public debt managers in the following three categories of 
contingent liabilities and included several recommendations under each section. Although intended for 
the public debt managers, in countries where DMOs do not have any roles and responsibilities in fiscal 
risk management in general and contingent liability management in particular these recommendations 
might be relevant for other government units. Government credit guarantees This study included examples from the implementation frameworks showing that the DMOs are 
involved in the management of government credit guarantees at different stages including the 
assessment of guarantee proposals, contract design and the risk management of the credit guarantee 
portfolio. The main recommendations of this study are the following: -Costs and risks of the credit guarantee should be calculated to inform the decision-making 
authorities accordingly. -Programme loan guarantees should have clearly-stated objectives and a set of rules or a code 
of conduct for granting. -Fees corresponding to at least the expected cost of each guarantee should be charged from the 
beneficiaries. -The terms of the credit guarantee contracts should be drafted in a way as to clearly define and 
limit the guarantee in time and scope. -A ceiling on the stock or new issuances of credit guarantees might be helpful to promote fiscal 
discipline, limit the fiscal risk exposure and direct the policy-makers towards prioritisation 
among the applications. -Contingency reserve funds, whether actual or notional, is a useful tool to increase the 
governments' ability to cover possible future losses and monitor their financial position vis-à-
vis the existing guarantees. -Both quantitative and qualitative information on credit guarantees should be disclosed based 
on their expected cost and in such a way as to give a complete picture of the government's 
total financial position, both as part of debt management reporting and budgetary 
documentation. Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs The country practices in the area of PPP contingent liabilities revealed that DMOs are generally 
not involved in their management. However, based on the OECD/G20 recommendations for effective THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 41 PPP governance, certain functions to be performed by the central government units were discussed. In 
this context, this study recommends that public debt managers can well work together with other 
government units in the field of PPP guarantees. The main recommendations in this area are the 
following:  The PPP fiscal risks can be mitigated through strengthening the regulatory frameworks, 
strengthening the management and oversight frameworks, increasing transparency and 
integrating PPPs into the medium term budget process (IMF, 2014).  As is the case for the government credit guarantees, a central government unit should analyse 
the PPP guarantees to inform the decision-making authorities on the associated costs and 
risks.  Guarantee valuation should be considered as a critical component of the PPP decision 
making since the guarantees change the risk allocation between the public and the private 
partner.  Contingent liabilities under the PPP contracts should be centrally monitored at the central 
government level for the purpose of ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability.  DMOs can work together with the central budget authority and the PPP units in data 
consolidation, forecasting and reporting practices on the PPP contingent liabilities; or 
include this information in their debt reporting. Government sponsored insurance schemes Government deposit insurance systems and other government sponsored insurance programmes 
were discussed with examples from countries. The study showed that these insurance programmes 
comprise explicit contingent commitments on the side of governments. The degree of the DMOs' 
involvement in these special expertise areas was also quite low, based on the survey results. However, 
the following recommendations for the public debt managers were provided:  Stability in the financial markets is crucial for public debt managers and a healthy banking 
system that runs with effective prudential regulations, and supervision, with a credible and 
well managed deposit insurance framework would contribute to this end.  Public debt managers are recommended to be well informed of the contingent liabilities 
under the government sponsored insurance systems.  Clear legislative frameworks defining the scope and nature of government's role within the 
insurance programmes are recommended.  Regular coordination between deposit and other insurance managers and public debt 
managers over the fiscal risks arising from the financial system are considered useful.  Analyses involving finance ministries and DMOs are highly recommended before enrolling 
governments in the insurance programmes with direct and contingent fiscal commitments. 42 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT © OECD 2017 REFERENCES Aslan, C. and D. Duarte (2014),  " How Do Countries Measure, Manage, and Monitor Fiscal Risks
