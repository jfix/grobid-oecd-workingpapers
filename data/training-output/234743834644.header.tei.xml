	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Assessments of the economic benefits of transportation infrastructure investments are critical to good<lb/> policy decisions. At present, most such assessments are based of two types of studies: micro-scale studies<lb/> in the form of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and macro-scale studies in the form of national or regional<lb/> econometric analysis. While the former type takes a partial equilibrium perspective and may therefore<lb/> miss broader economic benefits, the latter type is too widely focused to provide much guidance<lb/> concerning specific infrastructure projects or programs. Intermediate (meso-scale) analytical frameworks,<lb/> which are both specific with respect to the infrastructure improvement in question and comprehensive in<lb/> terms of the range of economic impacts they represent, are needed. This paper contributes to the<lb/> development of meso-scale analysis via the specification of a computable general equilibrium (CGE)<lb/> model that can assess the broad economic impact of improvements in transportation infrastructure<lb/> networks. The model builds on recent CGE formulations that seek to capture the productivity penalty on<lb/> firms and the utility penalty on households imposed by congestion (Meyers and Proost, 1997; Conrad,<lb/> 1997) and others that model congestion via the device of explicit household time budgets (Parry and<lb/> Bento, 2001, 2002). The centerpiece of our approach is a representation of the process through which<lb/> markets for non-transport commodities and labor create derived demands for freight, shopping and<lb/> commuting trips. Congestion, which arises due to a mismatch between the derived demand for trips and<lb/> infrastructure capacity, is modeled as increased travel time along individual network links. Increased<lb/> travel time impinges on the time budgets of households and reduces the ability of transportation service<lb/> firms to provide trips using given levels of inputs. These effects translate into changes in productivity,<lb/> labor supply, prices and income. A complete algebraic specification of the model is provided, along with<lb/> details of implementation and a discussion of data resources needed for model calibration and application<lb/> in policy analysis.</div>
