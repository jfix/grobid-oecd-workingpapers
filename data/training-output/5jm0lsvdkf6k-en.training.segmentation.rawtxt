Uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum has already started to weaken growth in the United 
Kingdom. A UK exit (Brexit) would be a major negative shock to the UK economy, with economic fallout in 
the rest of the OECD, particularly other European countries. In some respects, Brexit would be akin to a 
tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK 
remained in the EU. The shock would be transmitted through several channels that would change 
depending on the time horizon. In the near term, the UK economy would be hit by tighter financial 
conditions and weaker confidence and, after formal exit from the European Union, higher trade barriers 
and an early impact of restrictions on labour mobility. By 2020, GDP would be over 3% smaller than 
otherwise (with continued EU membership), equivalent to a cost per household of GBP 2200 (in today's 
prices). In the longer term, structural impacts would take hold through the channels of capital, immigration 
and lower technical progress. In particular, labour productivity would be held back by a drop in foreign 
direct investment and a smaller pool of skills. The extent of foregone GDP would increase over time. By 
2030, in a central scenario GDP would be over 5% lower than otherwise – with the cost of Brexit 
equivalent to GBP 3200 per household (in today's prices). The effects would be larger in a more 
pessimistic scenario and remain negative even in the optimistic scenario. Brexit would also hold back GDP 
in other European economies, particularly in the near term resulting from heightened uncertainty would 
create about the future of Europe. In contrast, continued UK membership in the European Union and 
further reforms of the Single Market would enhance living standards on both sides of the Channel.

Les conséquences économiques du BREXIT : les coûts d'une décision L'adhésion à l'Union européenne a contribué à la prospérité économique du Royaume-Uni. 
Les incertitudes entourant l'issue du referendum ont déjà commencé à affaiblir la croissance britannique. 
Une sortie du Royaume-Uni de l'UE (Brexit) conduirait à un choc négatif majeur pour l'économie du pays 
et aurait des incidences pour tous les membres de l'OCDE, en particulier en Europe. Dans une certaine 
mesure, le Brexit équivaudrait à un impôt sur le PIB, imposant un coût durable et croissant sur l'économie, 
qui ne serait pas encouru si Royaume-Uni restait dans l'UE. Ce choc serait transmis par le jeu successif 
de différents canaux. Sur le court terme, l'économie britannique serait affectée par le durcissement des 
conditions financières et l'affaiblissement de la confiance puis, après sa sortie officielle de l'Union 
européenne, par le relèvement des obstacles aux échanges et les conséquences précoces des limitations 
à la mobilité de la main-d'oeuvre. À l'horizon 2020, le PIB serait plus faible de 3 % qu'autrement (en cas de 
maintien dans l'UE), équivalent à un coût moyen de 2250 GBP par foyer (en prix actuels). Sur le plus long 
terme, les effets structurels s'affirmeraient par le biais de trois canaux : les capitaux, l'immigration et un 
progrès technique moindre. En particulier, la productivité du travail serait pénalisée par une baisse de 
l'investissement étranger direct et par l'accès à un volume de compétences plus limité. Le manque 
à gagner en termes de PIB se creuserait avec le temps. En 2030, selon le scénario de référence, le PIB 
serait inférieur de plus 5 % qu'autrement – et le montant de l'« impôt Brexit » atteindrait alors 3200 GBP 
par ménage (en prix actuels). Les conséquences seraient encore plus marquées dans le scénario le plus 
défavorable, et resteraient négatives y compris dans le scénario favorable. Une sortie du Royaume-Uni de 
l'UE entraverait également le PIB dans d'autres économies européennes, notamment sur le court terme, 
en raison des incertitudes politiques sur l'avenir de l'Europe. À l'inverse, un maintien du Royaume-Uni 
dans l'Union européenne et la poursuite des réformes du marché unique amélioreraient les niveaux de vie 
des deux côtés de la Manche. Classification JEL : C54, E24, E44, H12 Mots-clés : Brexit, Union européenne, incertitude, primes de risque, confiance, commerce, IDE, compétences,

Kingdom (UK) has doubled, outpacing other affluent non-EU English-speaking countries. The referendum 
on EU membership of 23 June 2016 could lead to a UK exit (Brexit), which would have persistent adverse 
consequences on economic activity in the UK, and would result in negative near-term spillovers elsewhere, 
particularly in the rest of the EU. Opinion polls suggest that the outcome of the referendum is particularly uncertain. Financial markets 
have increasingly begun to price in the risk of Brexit. Economic uncertainty has also risen and started to 
hurt confidence and business investment, weakening UK growth. Were Brexit to happen, the shock would be transmitted through several channels, the intensity of 
which would depend on policy developments and the time horizon considered. In some respects, Brexit 
would be akin to a tax, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy over time. Near term: Brexit is assumed to be followed rapidly by negotiations to withdraw from the EU, 
suggesting the possibility of a formal exit in late-2018. This would be followed by new trade negotiations 
with the EU over 2019-23 and possibly by measures to reduce immigration. The following channels would 
operate: @BULLET Heightened economic uncertainty would reduce confidence, holding back spending decisions, and 
tighten financial conditions by lifting risk premia, thus increasing the cost of finance and reducing 
its availability. @BULLET A danger is that large capital outflows, or a break in inflows, might threaten the financing of the 
record-high current account deficit of 7% of GDP. @BULLET After leaving the EU, the UK would lose unrestricted access to the Single Market, and preferential 
access to 53 non-EU markets. UK trade would then initially be governed by World Trade 
Organisation rules, leading to higher tariffs for goods and to other barriers in accessing the Single 
Market, notably for financial services. Bilateral UK-EU trade would contract. @BULLET Concluding a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, similar to the one between the EU and Canada, 
would provide a partial offset for UK trade by 2023. Yet, the costs of accessing the Single Market 
would still be higher than they are now after that time. @BULLET The UK would also continue to face additional barriers on third-country markets to which 
preferential access was lost as a result of EU exit. Negotiating new trade treaties would take time. @BULLET Immigration accounts for one-half of UK GDP growth since 2005, with more than 2 million jobs 
created. Curbs to the free movement of labour from the EU and, more importantly, a weaker UK 
economy after exit, would gradually reduce the incentives for economic migration to the UK and 
would be a cost to the economy. @BULLET Brexit would generate a financial shock beyond the UK, magnified by the appreciation of other 
currencies against sterling. @BULLET By 2020, these effects could shave off over 3 percentage points of UK GDP, with costs equivalent 
to GBP 2200 per household. The GDP loss in the reduced EU would be around 1 percentage 
point. Longer term: Brexit would continue to generate substantial structural changes in the economy, 
reflecting the new relationship with the EU and new policies over 2024-30. The following channels would 
materialise: @BULLET Access to the Single Market is important for foreign direct investment (FDI). Brexit would cut FDI 
inflows, notably from the EU, resulting in lower UK business investment and a decline in the capital THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 7 stock over time. This, in turn, would negatively weigh on trade, innovation and reduce managerial 
quality. @BULLET Trade and investment are important drivers of long-term GDP growth. Brexit would result in lower 
openness and innovation, weakening technical progress and productivity in the UK. @BULLET Long-term GDP growth would be further reduced through a smaller pool of skills, stemming from 
lower immigration and reduced FDI, reducing managerial quality. @BULLET The UK labour and product markets are amongst the most flexible in the OECD, which suggests 
that EU regulations are not an important barrier. Nonetheless, it would be possible to pursue 
further regulatory liberalisation, although this would be challenging since regulations are 
comparatively low and the gains would be limited. @BULLET Fiscal savings from stopping net transfers to the EU budget are likely to be 0.3-0.4% of GDP per 
year, which is a relatively small amount. Lower GDP growth would weigh on the fiscal position 
significantly, limiting the scope to use the net EU budget savings to relax fiscal policy. @BULLET By 2030, in a central scenario, UK GDP would be over 5% smaller than if the UK had remained a 
member of the EU. The costs would then be equivalent to GBP 3200 per household (in today's 
prices). In a more pessimistic scenario these would be even higher, at GBP 5000 per household. 
In the longer term, the impact on the remaining EU countries would be small given the relatively 
low UK share in global trade and the scope for other policies to offset the shock. @BULLET In addition to the decline in output, the cumulative effects of the different shocks from Brexit also 
reduce the real stock of net assets the UK has available to provide future returns and meet future 
commitments. UK net worth is over 4% below baseline (in today's prices) by 2030 in the central 
scenario. Alternatively, remaining in the EU, coupled with further reforms of the Single Market, could boost 
trade and foreign direct investment in all EU members, including the UK. The effects would be even larger 
if the EU were to successfully conclude new free trade and investment agreements with the rest of the 
world. Impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom through channels and over time Difference in real GDP relative to the UK staying in the EU Source: OECD calculations. GDP

Channels THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION 8 OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 Introduction The new agreement with the EU has paved the way for the upcoming referendum in the UK 
about EU membership. In January 2013, the Prime Minister promised that the UK government would 
negotiate more favourable arrangements for continued membership of the EU, and subsequently hold a 
referendum as to whether the UK should remain in the EU or leave. This commitment was confirmed after 
the Conservative party won a parliamentary majority at the general election in May 2015. The new 
settlement for the UK in the EU was concluded at the European Council meeting of 18-19 February 2016, 
and the referendum was set for 23 June 2016. The agreement covers four areas: economic governance, 
competiveness, sovereignty, and social benefits and free movement of people (Box 1). It includes new opt-
outs from further integration, and by acknowledging the special status of the UK, it confirms the existing 
differentiated integration of Europe. Box 1. Four areas of the new settlement for the United Kingdom in the European Union 1) Economic governance: safeguarding the rights and competences of non-euro area countries. Non-euro 
area countries cannot create obstacles to a further deepening of the euro area, but discrimination between countries 
participating in the euro area and those that are not is prohibited, and any difference of treatment must be based  " on 
objective reasons " . Legal acts linked to the functioning of the euro area are to respect the internal market, not 
discriminate in trade between member states, and respect the competences, rights and obligations of non-euro area 
countries. Non-euro area countries (and those not participating in the banking union) will not contribute to emergency 
and crisis measures to safeguard the financial stability of the euro. Supervision, regulation and resolution of financial 
institutions and markets of non-euro area countries are a matter of their own authorities. 2) Competitiveness: strengthening the Single Market and taking concrete steps towards better 
regulation. This implies lowering administrative burdens, especially on small and medium sized enterprises, repealing 
unnecessary legislation, and pursuing an ambitious policy on trade. Progress on reaching these objectives will be 
assessed regularly. 3) Sovereignty: recognising that the UK is not committed to further political integration into the EU. 
Moreover, if national Parliaments representing a qualified majority of 55% object to a draft legislative act (so-called  " red 
card " ), then consideration of such an act should be discontinued (unless the draft is amended to accommodate the 
concerns). The respect of the principle of subsidiarity (which implies that decisions should be taken as closely as 
possible to the citizen) is reinforced. 4) Social benefits and free movement of people: responding to exceptional inflows of workers from other 
EU countries. Measures include the creation of a safeguard mechanism (so-called  " emergency brake " ), which can be 
invoked when migrant inflows undermine the sustainability of the social security system, create serious and persistent 
difficulties in the job market, or put excessive pressures on public services. In particular, access to in-work benefits 
would be limited for new workers for a total period of up to four years from the start of employment (in a graduated 
way). The duration of the application of this safeguard mechanism is seven years. Other measures to contain 
immigration include the indexation of child benefits to the standard of living in the country where the child resides and 
steps to prevent sham marriages. Membership in the EU has contributed to the economic prosperity of the UK. Since 1973, when 
the UK joined the EU, UK GDP per capita doubled, increasing more than in other non-EU English speaking 
countries over the same period, including in the United States (US) (Figure 1). Domestic policies partly 
explain this strong performance, but geographic proximity and unrestricted access to the largest market in 
the world are undeniably important factors as well. For smaller countries with competitive markets the 
benefits could be even larger. For example, Ireland, which also joined the European Union in 1973, had a 
near quadrupling of its GDP per capita. THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 9 Figure 1. Since EU membership in 1973, UK living standards have risen more than in peers Real GDP

In constant purchasing power parities. Source: OECD (2016), OECD National Accounts Statistics (database), April. A multipolar world implies that the UK is economically stronger as an EU member, and in turn 
contributes to the EU strength. Several economic indicators suggest that the global influence and 
bargaining power of the UK are greater when combined with those of other European economies (Figure 
2). The EU has the largest proportion of world GDP and trade, closely followed by the US and China. 
However, after the withdrawal of the UK, the EU share would be smaller than those of the US and China 
for GDP, and behind the US for trade. The UK's proportion of world GDP is broadly comparable to that of 
Canada and Australia combined, whereas trade is similar to their average. The EU's shares of global 
population and territory are small, and the UK represents less than 1% of each. Figure 2. Global economic power of the United Kingdom is greater through the European Union Percentage share of world total 1 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933350988

The weighted average of recent 
polls from major agencies shows that public opinion is split (Figure 3). Since mid-2015,  " leave "  voting 
intentions have been gaining ground and the lead of  " remain "  voting intentions has been falling gradually, 
with the proportion of undecided voters being broadly unchanged. Uncertainty about the predictive power 
of these polls, however, is considerable as the official campaign has started only recently (on 15 April). Figure 3. People's voting intentions are neck and neck Weighted average of available opinion polls, percentage 12http://dx.doi.org/888933350998 Source: Polling agencies and ECO calculations. The risk of Brexit is increasingly reflected in financial asset prices. The cost of insuring UK 
public debt against sovereign default has been rising since 14 October, when the President of the 
European Commission first warned about only limited progress in negotiations with the UK. CDS spreads 
remain low relative to the financial crisis period, but their increase since mid-October is significant and 
higher than for peers (Figure 4, Panel A). CDS spreads have also edged up in the euro area. For the UK, 
the rise reflects investors' fears rather than a genuine risk of sovereign default following Brexit, given the 
Bank of England's ability to act as a lender of last resort. Equity prices in the UK and the euro area have 
rebounded less than in the US, but remain resilient as many listed companies are global (Figure 4, Panel 
B). Some of the recent weakness in sterling (Figure 5, Panel A) could also be attributed to Brexit fears, as 
it appears more depreciated than interest rate differentials and global risk sentiment might suggest. The 
cost of three-month currency options spiked three months before the referendum, on March 23, and 
remains high, implying that investors expect further depreciation in case the referendum would result in 
Brexit (Figure 5, Panel B). A vote for exit would undoubtedly generate additional uncertainty and lead to a 
marked deterioration in financial conditions for some considerable time. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Jan-13 Apr-13

Uncertainty about the referendum has begun to hold back UK growth, and concerns are rising 
in European economies. Businesses have started to defer investment projects, with UK business 
investment declining by 2% in the last quarter of 2015. Some recent surveys of chief financial officers of 
the UK's largest companies indicate rising risk aversion, soaring uncertainty over business conditions, 
falling hiring decisions, and reduced capital spending intentions, with the UK's upcoming EU referendum 
considered to be the top risk to business prospects. Economic policy uncertainty has been growing over 
the recent months, more in the UK than in the EU, which has occurred in parallel to an easing in monthly 
estimates of UK GDP growth by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Figure 6). The 
immediate consequence of a  " leave "  vote would be greater uncertainty, and a significant impact on growth 
(see below). The number of Google searches for  " Brexit "  has recently spiked and remains high, and the 
geographical distribution of searches suggests that Brexit is a concern mainly in other EU countries

The newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is constructed based on articles from two newspapers per country: 
The Times of London and Financial Times for the UK; Le Monde and Le Figaro for France; Handelsblatt and Frankfurter 
Allgemeine Zeitung for Germany; Corriere Della Sera and La Repubblica for Italy; and El Mundo and El Pais for Spain. The 
European-wide index, is calculated as an unweighted average across all 10 European newspapers. The number of newspaper 
articles containing the terms uncertain or uncertainty, economic or economy, and one or more policy-relevant terms are counted

access to the Single Market, which has strengthened the comparative advantage of the City. 
Exports to EU countries account for about 12% of UK GDP and about 45% of total UK exports, and for 
imports the EU is even a more important partner (Figure 8, Panel A). Some 3 million jobs are linked to 
exports destined for the EU. The UK has a deficit in goods trade vis-à-vis the EU, but a surplus in services 
(Figure 8, Panel B), in particular in financial services. Financial services accounted for 7% of UK output 
and 4% of employment in 2015. Exports of financial services amount to slightly more than 2.5% of GDP for 
the UK, against about 0.5% of GDP in EU peers (Figure 9, Panel A). The EU is the destination of some 
40% of UK financial exports, down from around 50% in 2000. However, the UK financial industry remains 
dependent on the EU market, as the absolute size of UK exports has risen. Indeed, UK overall exports of 
financial services took off in the 2000s (Figure 9, Panel B), although statistical changes reduce data 
comparability over time. The EU absorbs around 45% of Swiss exports of financial services, despite the 
absence of passporting rights for its banks (see below), but Switzerland negotiated a favourable 
agreement when it was planning to join the EU in the early 1990s. 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 United

April. Negotiating a new trade agreement with the EU is likely to be complex. Possible arrangements 
vary from remaining a member of the European Economic Area (like Norway) to a full exit by renouncing 
all EU rules and regulation (Table 1). The various possibilities have different impacts, but even among 
proponents of Brexit there is no consensus about the preferred arrangement. In addition, negotiations with 
the EU would take time, although the exit should be arranged two years after the UK formally expresses its 
desire to withdraw. Between the formal exit and reaching a new agreement, trade relations would be 
governed by the Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Table 1. Possible post-Brexit arrangements with the European Union Source: OECD compilation. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 2010

Economic Area (EEA) would ensure free movement of goods, capital, services and people, but the UK 
would have only limited influence on regulation and it would still need to pay contributions to the EU budget 
(its net contribution would probably be halved). This type of partnership has been for smaller countries 
(Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The UK could seek a more  " symmetric "  agreement to reflect its size, 
but Brexit would undermine its bargaining position and other EU countries could be less prone to 
compromise to preserve the unity of the Union. Also, an EEA-type arrangement implies free movement of 
people while the UK after exit would likely seek to have tighter controls in this area (Box 1). Further 
restrictions could possibly be introduced right after formal withdrawal from the EU in late 2018. An 
alternative would be to seek only European Free Trade Association (EFTA) membership, akin to 
Switzerland, but in this case the UK would lose the banking passport which gives access to the EU to its 
banks, it would need to negotiate trade agreements with individual EU countries, and it would still be 
required to abide by EU standards and product regulations. Membership of the EU Customs Union and 
arranging a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU would both reduce access to the Single Market, but 
the UK would still need to comply with a wide range of EU regulations. A  " full "  Brexit would be consistent 
with independence from EU rules, but access to the Single Market is reduced most when trade is based on 
the MFN regime of the WTO. Trade between the UK and the EU would become more costly. Administrative costs related to 
customs controls would rise for any of the arrangements with the EU. Compliance costs related to rules of 
origin obligations and conformity assessments would also increase, leading to trade diversion outside the 
EU over time. However, other than for the MFN approach, goods trade would remain relatively barrier free. 
Under MFN rules, maximum-tariffs are applicable on more than 95% of the value of good exports, with an 
average tariff of around 3%, but cars (10%) and tobacco (more than 70%) would face substantially higher 
tariffs. Services are usually exempt from import tariffs, but laws and regulations can (and do) restrict 
access via non-tariff barriers, and the UK would face greater difficulties in exporting financial services to 
Europe. Trade agreements with non-EU countries might be less advantageous and take a long time to 
conclude. With formal withdrawal from the EU, the current 36 FTAs of the EU covering 53 non-EU 
countries would no longer be applicable for the UK. New FTAs might be less advantageous than with the 
EU, with the bargaining position of the UK weaker than that of the EU as a whole (see Figure 2). The UK 
would be able to set lower tariffs on some import products, most notably food, which would reduce prices, 
but making this move unilaterally would undermine its negotiating position. The time needed to negotiate 
recent FTAs was at least 3 years (Table 2). The overall process could probably take longer than 
negotiations with the EU due to the large number of countries involved, with negative implications on trade, 
and could require additional resources. Table 2. Length of Free Trade Agreement negotiations, examples Source: OECD compilation. Negotiation

10 THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION 18 OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 Quantifying the near-term effects of Brexit Heightened uncertainty would hit financial conditions and confidence A vote for Brexit would lead to considerable uncertainty in the near term, further lifting risk 
premia and hurting confidence. The aftermath of a vote for leaving the EU would result in considerable 
additional volatility in financial markets and an extended period of uncertainty about future policy 
developments. Moreover, negotiations over UK withdrawal from the EU would need to take place over 
2016-18, followed by trade negotiations with the EU in 2019-2023, which is likely to contribute to enhanced 
uncertainty for an extended period. Past experience indicates that greater uncertainty, whether reflected in 
the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the UK or greater stock market volatility, would be associated 
with higher corporate bond spreads (Figure 10). Uncertainty would also depress asset prices, reduce the 
availability of bank credit and increase its cost for the private sector. A hit to confidence could also lead 
households and businesses to postpone their spending decisions temporarily. These shocks would affect 
the UK and would be transmitted to other countries, mainly in Europe. As the euro area crisis and the 
global financial crisis have shown, adverse financial shocks in one country can quickly spread to others. Figure 10. Corporate bond spreads are correlated with policy uncertainty and equity volatility 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351060 1.

2019 when the UK is assumed to exit formally from the EU. Departure from the EU would be a source 
of considerable further disruption in the next few years, in itself keeping uncertainty relatively elevated. 
Given the complexity of the task, it is highly unlikely that the current trading arrangements that the UK has 
with the EU, and the countries with which the EU has separate agreements, would have been successfully 
replaced by the end of 2018. Hence, trade with the EU and other countries would initially revert to a WTO 
MFN-basis (Box 2). This would raise the tariff and non-tariff barriers facing UK exporters. In addition, the 
ending of the EU-wide passporting rights of UK-based financial services companies would be a 
considerable extra obstacle. Subsequently, a new FTA with the EU, which is assumed to occur by 2023, 
would reduce the barriers facing UK exporters, but not eliminate them entirely. The reduction in trade 
would not only have a direct negative impact on economic activity, but also hold back the overall economic 
dynamism of the UK economy. Shocks originating in the UK are calibrated (Box 3) and simulated with the 
National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM). Box 2. Quantification of trade effects when the United Kingdom formally exits the European Union The impact of trade shocks was analysed with the OECD's METRO model (OECD 2015), assuming two 
distinct stages: @BULLET When the UK loses preferential access to the EU market, it faces the EU's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs. The UK, in turn, imposes MFN rates on its imports (assumed to be equal to the EU's current 
bound MFN rates). Similarly, the UK faces MFN treatment in all other export markets and in turn imposes 
import tariffs. MFN tariffs are approximated using bound rates of the World Trade Organization. This 
underestimates the true amount of border barriers where there are existing import quotas and complex 
mixed tariffs. Trade costs in financial services between the UK and the EU are allowed to increase by 20%, 
which is a conservative assumption as some studies suggest that exports of financial services to the EU 
could fall by half following the loss of passporting rights for banks (Capital Economics, 2016). @BULLET Subsequently, when the UK negotiates a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU, it goes back to the current zero-tariff regime for trade with the EU, but continues to trade with other countries under 
MFN rules as before. Since the UK is no longer capable of influencing EU standards and regulations 
regulatory regimes are likely to diverge over time. This leads to new trade costs on goods, as the UK is 
assumed to achieve only one-half of the cost savings from the common market when concluding the FTA 
with the EU (estimates based on OECD (2011)). The UK would also face rules of origin obligations in a new 
EU-UK FTA. Those are approximated as an increase of export costs equal to 10% of the tariff reductions 
achieved when entering the FTA (following Petri and Plummer, 2016). In addition, trade costs in financial 
services between the UK and the EU are assumed to drop from 20% to 10%, leaving them higher than prior 
to EU exit. No other barriers on services are modelled. This is very likely to lead to an underestimation of the 
ultimate slowdown in services trade. FTAs between the UK and other countries are not treated as finalised 
as priority is given to an FTA with the EU. Real exports would initially drop by 8% if the UK were to lose its preferential access to the EU market and 
its FTA's with third countries (Table 3). The EU-UK MFN would decrease all trade between EU and UK, but MFN 
restrictions vis-à-vis other countries then change the effect. This is because restrictions imposed by other countries are 
partly larger than those imposed by the EU. If subsequently a new FTA between the UK and the EU27 were negotiated 
that would re-install previous free market access, and some of that loss would be recuperated, but UK exports would 
still see an overall decline of some 6.5% relative to the current situation. Trade would be lower for all main categories of goods, hampering the functioning of value chains. The 
trade reduction in intermediate inputs has a particularly negative effect, as semi-finished products and components 
typically cross borders to be further processed and combined with domestic produce before being exported for the next 
stage and eventually reaching the final consumer. Not only would UK producers supply less intermediates to the EU, 
the reverse is also true: imports of intermediates from the EU into value chains in the UK would fall by more than 9% in 
the UK MFN scenario, and this would only partially be offset in the event of a new FTA between the UK and the EU 27. 
EU-UK value chains would thus become less tightly knit and production costs would increase. The result of less than 
full recuperation of EU markets is partly due to the assumption of slightly diverging regulatory regimes. Hence, new 
trade costs related to non-tariff measures and rules of origin would have to be incurred by UK exporters. THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION 20 OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 Table 3. Decomposition of the near-term trade shock Source: OECD calculations. Even when an FTA with the EU is in place, trade would be significantly lower in several sectors. Detailed 
sector-level analysis reveals that food and agriculture (-7%), chemicals (-9%), metals (-11%) and transport equipment 
(-12%) would see the largest negative impacts on production. Services, which together account for more than 80% of 
employment in the UK, would witness a contraction of between -2% (business services) and -6% (financial services). 
Part of that drop is due to a complementarity between services and manufacturing: services are necessary to enable 
manufacturing and trade in goods, and when production shrinks, so does services activity. The scenarios are likely to 
underestimate the importance of potential new barriers to services trade, as only barriers to financial services are 
incorporated in the analysis. Note: F. Van Tongeren, D. Flaig and C. Arriola, from the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate, prepared this Box and related

February 2016. Box 3. Calibration of the near-term effects of Brexit Financial market shocks are assumed to be of a magnitude similar to those observed during the acute 
phase of the euro area crisis in 2011-12, but much smaller than during the financial crisis in 2008-09. An 
equation linking corporate bond spreads, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUI) and stock market volatility is 
estimated for the UK since 2010. From April 2016, the bond spread is generated by adding a two standard deviation 
shock to the EPUI and a two standard deviation shock to stock market volatility, relative to a baseline where stock 
market volatility and policy uncertainty are set to their average values in 2014-15. As a result, the corporate bond 
spread is 100 basis points above the baseline in the latter half of 2016 and 150 basis points above the baseline in 
2017. Broadly reflecting the calibrated shock above, the investment and equity risk premia are raised by 50 basis 
points in the first half of 2016, 150 basis points over 2016H2-2017 and 100 basis points in 2018. Also, the wedge 
between bank borrowing and lending rates for the household and corporate sectors is raised by 100 basis points over 
2016H2-2017. Finally, the term premium on government long-term bonds is raised, initially by 20 basis points in the 
first half of 2016 and then by 50 basis points over in the rest of the simulation period. After 2018, these financial shocks 
are allowed to fade gradually, although not completely, since formal exit from the EU would itself be an additional 
source of uncertainty and additional risk. UK investment and equity risk premia are assumed to still be 70 basis points 
higher than otherwise by 2023, although the shock to credit conditions is allowed to fade earlier by 2021. MFN rules for trade with the EU and other

precautionary saving. Higher saving would add to the negative impact on consumption from the decline in activity 
and lower asset prices. To take this effect into account, a shock is applied raising the ex-ante saving rate by a little 
over 1 percentage point in the latter half of 2016. The aftermath of a vote to leave would also be likely to raise sterling risk premia, leading to an additional 
sharp exchange rate depreciation. The impact of this depreciation is likely to be more limited than in the past, but at 
the margin it would be likely to reduce the overall impact of the other forces acting on the UK economy, whilst adding 
to challenges in other economies, especially in Europe. A 10% depreciation of sterling against the US dollar was 
assumed to occur in mid-2016, with all other bilateral exchange rates held unchanged. The depreciation was assumed 
to be persistent, but to gradually fade over the simulation period. On average, the sterling effective exchange rate is 
around 6% below baseline in 2017 and 4% below baseline from 2018 onwards, implying an appreciation of euro 
relative to sterling and a permanent decline in the nominal effective sterling exchange rate. The UK decision to exit could add to centrifugal forces in other parts of Europe and reinforce uncertainty 
about the future of the Union and the Single Market. The resulting uncertainty could lead to more difficult financial 
conditions in other European countries. To illustrate the possible magnitude of such factors, investment and equity risk 
premia and the spread between household borrowing and deposit rates were widened in all European Economic Area 
(EEA) countries. The shocks applied were between one-quarter and one-third of those in the UK, with risk premia 
rising by 50 basis points at their peak and the interest rate spread by 25 basis points. No shocks were applied directly 
to either term premia or to the household saving rate. The risk premia shock was held at 25 basis points over 2019-23. For trade, a two-stage approach was adopted. The trade effects of the UK leaving the EU were obtained by 
the OECD's METRO model (Box 2) and were fed into the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) macro 
model for the world economy. The reduction in UK trade openness would also start to have costs for the overall economic dynamism of 
the UK economy, reducing competition and the inflow of new ideas and products. OECD estimates by Egert and 
Gal (2016) imply that a four percentage points decline in trade openness reduces total factor productivity by 0.8% after 
five years (and by 1.2% after 10 years). In the NiGEM near-term scenario the impact on productivity of the sharp fall in 
trade (Box 2) was modelled as a decline in labour-augmenting technical progress building up to 1.6% by 2023. Withdrawal from the EU could also provide scope for the imposition of tighter controls on inward 
migration. This would reinforce the endogenous effects on economic migration coming from a weaker UK economy 
and labour market. Net inward migration is assumed to decline by 84 000 per year over 2019-2023, with around 75% 
of this reflected in the labour force. All other model assumptions were the same as without a Brexit. The NiGEM model was run in backward-
looking mode, reflecting a judgment that in a period characterised by considerable uncertainty, businesses and 
households would be unlikely to behave as if the future was known with certainty. All shocks were assumed to persist 
at their 2023 levels thereafter for the purposes of model solution, but this assumption has no effect on the initial impact 
of the shocks up to 2023. Monetary policy was left exogenous (although the depreciation of sterling changes monetary 
conditions), and the budget targeting rule was left unchanged, implying that the UK government reacts to the various 
shocks by attempting to maintain its announced budget path. The consequences of relaxing these assumptions are 
discussed in the main text. Source: Egert, B. and P. Gal (2016),  " The quantification of structural reforms: A new Framework " , OECD Economics Department 
Working Papers, forthcoming. Brexit would generate a large negative shock to the UK economy, which would spillover to 
other European countries. Assuming fixed interest rates at the zero lower bound, UK GDP growth would 
be reduced by 0.5 percentage point in both 2017 and 2018. The onset of the trade shock in 2019 adds to 
these costs considerably, with GDP growth reduced by 1.5 percentage points that year. These shocks 
would be larger still without the depreciation of sterling included in the scenario, although the impact of 
such a change may be weaker now than in the past. By 2020, real GDP would be more than 3% below the 
level it would otherwise have been in the absence of Brexit (Figure 11), equivalent to a cost of GBP 2200 
per household. By 2023, even as the risk premia shocks fade, and the economy begins to adjust to the 
large trade shock, helped by a long-lasting depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, real GDP 
would still remain around 2.5% lower than otherwise. THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION 22 OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 Figure 11. Near-term effects of Brexit on real GDP in the United Kingdom and the European Union Difference from baseline, per cent 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351079 Source: OECD calculations. The real exchange rate decline reflects the adjustment required to help restore external 
balance in a situation in which exports are reduced. However, the UK terms of trade deteriorate 
sharply, with export prices declining, as exporters try to improve global market share, and import prices 
pushed up sharply by the depreciation of sterling. Lower exports and investment and the real exchange 
rate decline hit import volumes substantially, with a decline of over 9% by 2020. At its peak in 2020, the UK 
unemployment rate would be around 1.5 percentage point above baseline. Business investment would be 
especially hard hit, declining by over 10% by 2020. Equity prices would also be strongly affected, initially 
declining by around 15%. The negative shocks would raise the UK budget deficit substantially. The deficit would increase 
by around 0.9 percentage point of GDP on average per annum over 2019-21 (in the absence of a fixed 
budget target), more than offsetting the possible net fiscal savings from the ending of EU membership in 
these years. This decline reflects the impact of lower activity on tax revenues and the costs of higher 
unemployment. The UK could temporarily receive some additional revenue from tariffs on exit, by imposing 
multilateral MFN rates on all trading partners, but these are likely to be limited, at around 0.3% of GDP, 
and decline considerably once the UK concludes a new FTA with the EU by 2023. Thus there appears little 
scope to use the EU budget savings to relax fiscal policy substantially for an extended period, unless there 
is a decision to adjust other taxes and spending, or to raise the size of the overall budget deficit. With shocks of between one-quarter and one-third of those in the UK, the GDP of the reduced 
EU would be little affected in 2016, but would fall by close to 1% by 2020 (Figure 11, Panel B). Even 
as the impact of higher risk premia in these economies starts to fade, the sharp decline in UK import 
demand remains a sizeable drag for some economies. A larger sterling depreciation against domestic 
currencies would magnify the negative impact on other European economies, as would any deeper 
confidence shocks in those economies. On the other hand, a euro depreciation could help to offset some 
of the negative impact, but at the expense of magnifying the negative effects on output in the UK. Centrifugal forces within countries and within the reduced EU are not quantified fully, but 
would be a major downside risk. Following the UK decision to exit, there could be doubts about the 
future of the Single Market, and more broadly, of the EU. The UK itself would also face the possibility of a 
break up, with political leaders in Scotland having indicated that they would seek a new referendum on 
Scottish independence. Such developments would tighten financial conditions further. An actual break up, 
either of the EU or the UK, would lead to considerably greater financial turbulence and a much larger 
decline in investment and output. -3.5 -3.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 -3.5 -3.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 2018

2023 United Kingdom European Union excluding the UK THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 23 The large current account deficit, which exposes the UK to a sudden stop, and debt 
refinancing issues are additional risks in the event of Brexit. The current account deficit was around 
5.5% of GDP in the second half of 2015 (Figure 12, Panel A), and reached an unprecedented level of 7% 
of GDP in last quarter. It was financed significantly less by direct investment in the second half of the year 
(Figure 12, Panel B), creating important risks if there were to be sudden and large capital outflows. 
Moreover, refinancing of government debt could also come under greater stress than assumed in the near 
term scenario. Public debt is close to 90% of GDP (Maastricht definition), about a quarter of it is held by 
foreigners, and the average maturity of public debt is long (slightly above 15 years). In January 2016, the 
auction of five-year UK government debt nearly failed, and there is a risk that foreign investors could shun 
UK government debt following a referendum outcome in favour of Brexit. The banking system could also 
be subject to capital flight, and although it is has stronger capital and liquidity buffers than before the crisis, 
the Bank of England has announced that it will offer additional liquidity support for banks just before and 
after the referendum. If these risks were to materialise, they would aggravate the loss in GDP. Figure 12. Financing of the large UK current account deficit requires substantial inflows As a percentage of GDP 1 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351084 1.

Regulatory divergence would 
increase steadily, resulting in increasing trade costs. Some trade relations with overseas companies would 
be hampered. A gradual loss of export-oriented inward foreign direct investment, especially in 
manufacturing and financial services, would further hit export capacity. Foreign direct investment would decline as the UK becomes a less attractive destination The UK is the most attractive destination for FDI in the EU, partly owing to access to the EU 
internal market. The UK accounts for the largest share of FDI inflows into the EU (Figure 13, Panel A). 
FDI positions in the UK of both EU and non-EU investors have steadily increased over time (Figure 13, 
Panel B), and both groups cite the Single Market as fairly or very important for the UK's attractiveness for 
FDI, on top of its structural advantages, such as flexible labour and product markets. The large FDI inflows 
have contributed to greater trade integration of the UK with the EU and strengthened its comparative 
advantage in many sectors. Figure 13. The United Kingdom is an attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351093 1.

FDI inflows would seem unavoidable, reducing the inflows of new ideas and knowledge into the UK. This 
would weaken fixed investment, reduce export capacity and hit innovation and productivity (technical 
progress) over time. Managerial quality would also decline, given the evidence that management quality is 
higher in foreign multinationals in the UK than in domestic firms, damaging organisational efficiency and 
further hitting overall productivity. Some FDI inflows could be diverted to EU countries as the UK would 
become less attractive for both EU and non-EU clients. Foreign companies in the goods sector could 
prefer to invest in EU countries in order to ensure access to the Single Market and have certainty about 
trade relations with non-EU countries. The same could happen to FDI in the financial sector if the 
possibility of exporting financial services to EU countries is reduced due to a loss of passporting rights. 
Some financial institutions have already indicated that they will reconsider the size of their UK presence 
after a choice for Brexit. Lower immigration would lower labour force growth Since 2006, the number of annual immigrants arriving in the UK has been fluctuating around 
500 000. Immigration from the EU has been rising to the level of immigration from non-EU countries 
(Figure 14, Panel A), driven by migrants from longstanding EU members (EU15) (Figure 14, Panel B), 
perhaps owing to relatively weaker labour markets in many of these countries. The removal of the 
transitional restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers at end-2013 has also led stronger inflows from 
these countries (EU2). Immigration from countries that acceded to the EU in 2004 (EU8) pushed up inflows 
during 2006-08, but has been rather stable since. Figure 14. Immigration from the European Union has been rising Inflows of migrants to the United Kingdom in thousands 1 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351103 1.

EU2 THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION 26 OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 Immigrants, particularly from EU countries, have boosted GDP growth significantly in the UK. 
EU immigrants have higher employment rates than natives and almost all other migrant groups (Figure 15, 
Panel A). Migrants from countries that acceded to the EU in 2004 (EU8 countries) have a higher 
employment rate than EU migrants in general. EU migrants also have a better education than in most other 
EU countries (Figure 15, Panel B), although wages of immigrants from EU8 countries are rather low. 
Immigration has been a key factor behind the strong labour market. Out of around 2.5 million jobs that 
were added to the UK in 2005-15, 2.2 million were supplied by immigrants, with nearly 60% originating 
from the EU (Figure 16, Panel A). Immigrants have contributed on average 0.7 percentage points to GDP 
per year since 2005, accounting for roughly half of GDP growth, with a slightly higher contribution of 
immigrants from the EU than non-EU countries (Figure 16, Panel B). Immigration should also provide 
longer-term economic benefits by mitigating population ageing. Figure 15. European Union immigrants are well attached to the job market and have good skills 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351113 1.

Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database), April. Immigrants from the EU make a positive contribution to the public finances, despite relying on 
the UK welfare system, which is also the case of UK migrants elsewhere in the EU. As the vast 
majority of immigrants from EU member states are working, they are less likely to receive out-of-work 
benefits. However, as immigrants from new EU countries have comparatively lower wages, they are more 
often eligible for in-work tax credits. The net fiscal contribution of immigrant households in the UK is 
positive (Figure 17), and households of EU-immigrants are no exception. As migrants in the UK benefit 
from its welfare system, the same applies to UK migrants in other EU countries. Around 30 000 UK citizens 
receive unemployment benefits in other EU countries. This group is smaller than the 65 000 individuals 
from other EU countries who receive benefits in the UK, but the country distribution is different. In 
particular, UK unemployed in nine affluent EU countries outnumber claimants from those countries in the 
UK, and benefits in other EU countries tend to be higher than in the UK. -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 2005

dividends, immigration remains a major concern for the UK population. However, it is unlikely that a 
decision to restrict the number of (EU) immigrants would have a long-run impact on the unemployment of 
natives. Concerns stem from poor wage growth, which is a reflection largely of weak productivity 
developments (Figure 19, Panel B). Immigration is also increasing housing demand, creating upward 
pressure on house prices, which reduces affordability for first-time buyers. However, the UK faces a long-
standing problem of weak housing supply, which would require bolder domestic policies to relax land 
planning regulations. The UK Prime Minister has set the target of reducing net migration to below 100 000 
per year assuming that the UK remains in the EU. Although not directly linked to negotiations with the EU 
following Brexit, tighter controls in the UK could lead to a reduction of net migration from EU and non-EU 
countries to below this level. This factor would be reinforced by the impact of a weaker economy and a loss 
of inward investment. Labour market conditions and income levels in the UK relative to those in other 
European countries would be hit by exit, reducing the incentives for economic migration to the UK. A 
decline in inward investment would also lower new inflows of foreign managers and other skilled 
professionals. A loss of skills would reduce technical progress Lower immigration and weaker FDI could reduce the pool of skills. Measures to control 
immigration, based on the introduction of points systems as in Australia and Canada, help to increase skill 
levels of new immigrants. However, should immigration controls be high, the effect of higher quality would 
likely be offset by the effect of lower quantities, resulting in an overall reduction of the pool of skills which 
could efficiently be combined in the production process. In turn, this could increase skill mismatches. Also, 
another channel through which skills would be negatively affected is poorer FDI, resulting in weaker 
transfer of best-practice knowledge from abroad, including managerial expertise, weakening overall 
managerial quality over time. OECD research suggests (Figure 18) that this would have a negative impact 
on productivity, albeit modest. -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 CHE

Data", OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No. 1209, OECD Publishing. Further deregulation could have some positive effects Deregulation could benefit businesses, but the scope seems limited. For example, the UK has 
the second-lowest value of the OECD Product Market Regulation indicator and holds the 6 
th position in the 
World Bank's Doing Business ranking. Regulation of network industries has been the least restrictive 
among OECD countries, although the pace of regulatory reform has slowed down in recent years, possibly 
reflecting the increasing difficulty of enacting further reforms when they are already at low levels (Figure 
19, Panel A). However, in some sectors, notably post and road, the gap with the best performers remains 
sizeable (Figure 19, Panel B). Overall, EU membership has not been an obstacle for implementing liberal 
market policies, since regulations are low relative to those in other EU member states, and, given that the 
best performers in some areas are other EU countries, the UK is not even using all the available regulatory 
space. Reducing regulation in these areas thus requires overcoming strong domestic barriers, which would 
be challenging. Despite labour market regulation being among the least restrictive in the OECD, many UK 
firms find EU labour market regulation too tight, in particular the Temporary Agency Workers Directive and 
the Working Time Directive. However, there is no guarantee that the political constellation after Brexit 
would ensure more business friendly legislation in substitution of abolished EU laws. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 FIN JPN SWE NLD DEU BEL AUS NOR USA EST FRA DNK GBR POL AUT CZE CAN KOR SVK IRL ESP ITA THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION 30 OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 Figure 19.

Quantifying the longer-term effects of Brexit In the longer term, Brexit would generate substantial structural changes in the economy, 
reflecting the new relationship with the EU, new policies and adverse supply-side shocks. These 
changes are triggered by lower trade openness, the reduced attractiveness for FDI, less investment in 
research and development, a net decline in inward migration, lower managerial quality and additional 
regulatory reform (Box 4). These effects are assumed to cumulate over a decade or more. The changes in 
trade openness, regulatory performance, and both management quality and R&D intensity (via inward 
investment) would have long-run supply-side effects via their impact on total factor productivity (TFP). A 
decline in the labour force from reduced migration and the adverse impact on the capital stock from the 
series of negative shocks from 2016 onwards would add further supply-side challenges. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 A. Reduction in overall ETCR in the UK 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Electricity

United Kingdom THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BREXIT: A TAXING DECISION OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016 31 Box 4. Calibration of the longer-term effects of Brexit In the longer term, a central scenario is considered as well as an optimistic and pessimistic scenario. 
These draw on OECD research to quantify the impact of non-EU membership on trade openness and the inward FDI 
stock, different assumptions about the degree to which the UK reduces anti-competitive product market regulations in 
network industries, and the impact of changes in managerial quality. Different assumptions about the possible impact 
exit might have on net migration into the UK are also considered. As the results depend on how these different factors 
interact and their overall size, a range of outcomes from different specifications is used in the scenarios below. @BULLET In the longer term, trade openness is estimated to decline by between 10 to 20%, based on the range of empirical estimates presented in Table 1 in Fournier et al. (2015). @BULLET The longer term inward FDI stock is estimated to decline by between 10 to 45%, based the range of empirical estimates presented in Table 4 in Fournier (2015). This decline in FDI would also contribute 
indirectly to weaker trade performance. @BULLET Given the important role that high-productivity foreign-owned firms have in the UK business sector, the declines in inward FDI were assumed to transfer directly to the amount of R&D undertaken in the UK by 
foreign multinationals. To the extent that agglomeration economies from the UK research base matter, it is 
possible that this could overstate the likely longer term effect from EU exit, even if export-oriented foreign-
owned firms (including those in financial services) gradually withdrew from the UK. @BULLET The decline in inward investment was also judged to be likely to result in an overall reduction in management quality in the United Kingdom, based on Bloom et al. (2014). The impact of particular changes 
in managerial quality on skill mismatches, and hence productivity, was based on McGowan and Andrews 
(2015). @BULLET Annual net migration into the UK is assumed to decline by between 56 000 per annum to 116 000 per annum, depending on the stringency of future controls and the extent to which the weaker economy deters 
economic migration to the UK. In the central scenario, net migration into the UK is assumed to be 84 000 
lower per year. Implicitly, it is assumed that net migration from non-EU countries would fall compared to 
2015 levels, so that employers do not respond to tighter controls on EU migration by seeking to attract more 
people from outside the EU. @BULLET The decline in immigration also reduces labour force growth. It is assumed that 75% of the foregone migrants would have been in the labour force, consistent with evidence of the participation of recent EU 
immigration inflows. @BULLET Outside the EU, the UK might seek to improve the business climate by undertaking additional regulatory reforms to stimulate additional competition in network industries. The best possibility considered is that the 
UK continues to undertake reforms over the next 10 years at the same pace as during 2009-13, i.e. 0.2 
points per five-year period. In the pessimistic scenario, it is assumed that no further reforms in network 
industries are undertaken. The impact of forces acting in the different longer term scenarios is set out in Table 4. For simulation purposes, it 
was assumed that the full longer term effects on productivity of these changes emerge by 2026, a decade after the 
vote to exit. The annual decline in net immigration was assumed to persist from 2019 onwards, giving a total 
population decline of 1.3 million by 2030 in the  " pessimistic "  scenario. Table 4. Assumptions for longer term scenarios Source: OECD calculations. Optimistic

@BULLET A decline in business sector R&D intensity of 0.1 percentage points reduces TFP by 0.17% after ten years. 
@BULLET A change of -0.31 in ETCR increases TFP by 0.74% after ten years.

UK economy is reinforced by a longer-term decline in the business sector capital stock. This stems from a 
variety of factors. The TFP and migration shocks lower the level of potential output, reducing the equilibrium capital 
stock (all else equal). These longer term effects come on top of the hit to business investment and the capital stock 
over 2016-2023, from heightened uncertainty, higher risk premia and the hit to export levels on leaving the EU by 
2019. Both factors imply a long-lasting hit to the capital stock over 2026-2030, even if their impacts on business 
investment would slowly attenuate in the absence of shocks beyond 2023. If the UK undertook additional regulatory 
reforms this would provide a partial offset, but the overall long-run effects remain negative. By 2030, in the three 
scenarios set out here, the capital stock declines by around 6% (optimistic), 9% (central) and just over 12% 
(pessimistic). Even in the absence of the longer-term supply-side shocks, the disruptions in the years following the vote 
to exit are estimated to still leave the business capital stock weaker by over 3% through 2026-2030. The impact of the longer-term shocks was again assessed using the National Institute Global 
Econometric Model (NiGEM) macro model for the world economy. Monetary policies and exchange rates were 
endogenous, with the model run in forward mode given that the supply side shocks are ones that can eventually be 
anticipated by businesses and households. Budget targets were kept unchanged, so that any budgetary shortfall has 
to be offset by additional fiscal measures. With the full shocks only being reached from 2026 onwards, the impact on 
output builds up steadily over time. Sources: Adalet McGowan, M. and D. Andrews (2015), "Labour Market Mismatch and Labour Productivity: Evidence from PIAAC

A). This is equivalent to an annual reduction in UK GDP growth of 0.3 percentage points per annum over 
2016 to 2030. Around three-fifths of this shock is accounted for by the lower level of productivity (including 
its indirect effect via a lower capital stock). In turn, most of this stems from the decline in trade openness. 
Stronger regulatory reforms and a smaller decline in trade and inward FDI weaken the longer term output 
effect in the optimistic scenario, but GDP is still below baseline, by around 2.7% as of 2030. A failure to 
undertake regulatory reforms, together with strong declines in inward migration, trade openness and 
innovation would result in much more negative outcomes, with GDP over 7.5% below baseline by 2030.

Longer-term effects of Brexit on real GDP in the United Kingdom Difference from baseline, 2030 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351163 Source: OECD calculations. The impact on a per capita or per household basis is smaller, reflecting the decline in the 
population as well as the decline in output. Nonetheless, in the central scenario, the GDP decline is 
equivalent to a cost per household of GBP 3200 by 2030 relative to the baseline (Figure 20, Panel B). In 
the pessimistic scenario, the equivalent cost per household is nearly GBP 5000 in 2030 relative to the 
baseline. In addition to the decline in output (relative to baseline), the cumulative effects of the different 
shocks from Brexit also reduce the real stock of net assets the UK has available to provide future 
returns and meet future commitments. UK real net worth, given by the deflated sum of domestic 
tangible assets and the sterling value of net financial assets held by UK residents outside the UK, is over 
4% below baseline by 2030 in the central scenario (Figure 21). In per capita terms, this is equivalent to a 
decline of over GBP 4300 per person. Almost all of this stems from the longer-term decline in the business 
sector capital stock as a result of the negative shocks from Brexit, with only a small offset provided by an 
improved external position. In the pessimistic scenario, UK net worth (in 2015 prices) is just under 5.5% 
below baseline. -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 Optimistic scenario Central scenario Pessimistic scenario A. Impact on real GDP

Source: OECD calculations. Additional reforms in Europe would offer benefits for the UK In contrast to a Brexit, remaining in the EU and actively promoting and supporting reforms of 
the EU Single Market would lift living standards in the UK and the rest of Europe. The new 
settlement between the UK and the EU foresees further reforms, by lowering administrative burdens, 
especially for SMEs, repealing unnecessary legislation, and pursuing an ambitious policy on trade (Box 1). 
The Single Market has delivered substantial economic benefits and taking steps to complete it further by 
reducing regulatory heterogeneity and complexity within the EU would benefit trade in goods and services 
and FDI, and thereby generate additional economic benefits (Box 5). Box 5. An illustration of economic benefits from continuous EU membership Reforms that reduce barriers to competition would enhance trade and FDI for all EU members, including the UK. 
A lower bound of the possible gains can be obtained by looking only at reforms recommended by the OECD for the EU 
and embedded in the PMR indicator (OECD, 2016), and assuming that their implementation would be accompanied by 
a reduction of PMR heterogeneity. According to Fournier et al. (2015) and Fournier (2015), a scenario of a reformed 
EU could boost UK trade by 3% and the UK inward FDI stock by 2%. In particular, trade between the EU and the UK 
would increase by 4.5% and FDI between the UK and the EU by 3%. The benefits for trade and FDI in the whole EU 
would be roughly similar. The higher trade and FDI would raise GDP in both the UK and the EU (OECD, 2016). These 
effects could be larger if the EU also reaches new free trade and investment agreements with the rest of the world (e.g. 
the on-going EU-US negotiation on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). Note: J.-M. Fournier, from the OECD Economics Department, prepared this Box and related calculations.
