Unclassified English, French ECO/WKP(2009)77 2 ABSTRACT/RESUMÉ Promoting competition to strengthen economic growth in Belgium Prices for many goods and services in Belgium are higher than in other countries, reflecting generally weak 
competitive pressures. The government has recently introduced several reforms to strengthen the competition policy 
framework. Nevertheless, to reap the full benefits of competitive markets, past reforms should be complemented with 
a number of further measures. The powers of the Competition Authority can still be enhanced. Its effective degree of 
independence, substantially improved in the recent reform, and its accountability should be monitored in order to 
assess whether further measures in this direction are needed. In the retail sector competition-restricting regulations 
still protect existing companies against new entry and inhibit the diffusion of new business models and technologies. 
The reform efforts in the network sectors remain patchy. In the energy and telecommunication sectors the main issues 
are the dominant positions of the incumbents and the failure of network sector regulators to introduce a level playing 
field in order to allow new entry and expansion of competitors. In other sectors, such as postal services and rail 
transport, major steps towards liberalisation are still to come. Overall, sectoral regulators will need more 
independence and powers in order to tackle uncompetitive behaviour of the incumbents, while better communication 
between the regulatory authorities is necessary. These steps should help to secure the necessary basis for bringing 
productivity growth in line with best performance. This Working Paper relates to the 2009 OECD Economic Survey of Belgium 
(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/belgium). JEL classification: L41; L43; L50; K23.

de la faiblesse générale des pressions exercées par la concurrence. Le gouvernement a récemment introduit plusieurs 
réformes destinées à renforcer le cadre de la politique de concurrence. Néanmoins, pour tirer tout le profit de marchés 
concurrentiels, les réformes mises en oeuvre devraient être complétées par un certain nombre de mesures 
additionnelles. Les pouvoirs de l'Autorité de concurrence peuvent être encore renforcés. Son degré effectif 
d'indépendance (sensiblement rehaussé par la récente réforme) et son obligation de rendre compte devraient faire 
l'objet d'un suivi de manière à évaluer si de nouvelles mesures s'imposent à cet égard. Dans le commerce de détail, 
les réglementations restreignant la concurrence protègent toujours les entreprises en place contre l'arrivée de 
nouveaux concurrents et freinent la diffusion de nouveaux modèles économiques et de nouvelles technologies. Les 
efforts de réforme dans les industries de réseau demeurent parcellaires. Dans les secteurs de l'énergie et des 
télécommunications, les problèmes tiennent surtout aux positions dominantes des opérateurs historiques et à 
l'incapacité des autorités de régulation des industries de réseau à instaurer des conditions égales pour tous de manière 
à permettre l'arrivée de nouveaux concurrents et le développement de la concurrence. Dans d'autres secteurs, comme 
les services postaux et le transport ferroviaire, d'importantes mesures de libération sont toujours en attente. 
Globalement, les régulateurs sectoriels ont besoin de plus d'indépendance et de plus de pouvoirs pour contrer le 
comportement anticoncurrentiel des opérateurs historiques, et il est nécessaire d'améliorer la communication entre les 
autorités de régulation. Ces mesures devraient contribuer à assurer la base nécessaire pour porter la croissance de la 
productivité au meilleur niveau. Ce document de travail se rapporte à l'Étude économique de l'OCDE de la Belgique, 2009

The Belgian government is putting a greater emphasis on competition as a productivity 
enhancing tool and has implemented a number of reforms in this area. The government is now promoting 
competition with the objective of increasing consumer welfare, preserving purchasing power and 
encouraging entrepreneurship through facilitating new entry (Stratégie de Lisbonne, 2008, Accord du 
Gouvernement, Plan de Relance). However, there remains substantial scope to increase competitive 
pressures in order to boost potential growth of the economy and benefit consumers. The authorities have 
identified retail trade, food, energy and telecommunication as priority sectors in this respect. The retail 
sector regulation is more pervasive than in most OECD countries, protecting existing shops from 
competitive pressures as the entry of innovative business models and the diffusion of new technologies are 
inhibited. At the same time, the liberalisation of network sectors has been slower than elsewhere in the 
OECD while concentration is high and the effective functioning of regulators has proven difficult to 
achieve. As a result, prices are often higher than in other countries pointing to the need for reducing the 
barriers to entry and assuring a more level playing field. The paper starts with a general review of the 
competition framework. Then, the inherently competitive retail trade sector is analysed. Subsequently, the 
difficulties of introducing competition in the incumbent-dominated network sectors are considered. The 
paper concludes with a set of policy recommendations. More competition to benefit productivity, employment and consumer welfare 2. 
Over the past ten years, productivity and employment growth have remained somewhat slower 
relative to many other OECD countries (Table 1). At the same time progress in opening markets to 
competition has not been as fast as in the leading countries and the amount of restrictions to competition 
remains above the OECD best practice (Figure 1, Panel A and Wölfl et al., 2009). A growing body of 
empirical literature points to the existence of a positive link between competition and productivity growth 
on the one hand (Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2003, Conway et al., 2006) and between competition and 
employment on the other hand (Bassanini and Duval, 2006), suggesting that insufficient competition policy 
enforcement may have lowered economic growth in Belgium. Furthermore, it appears that the Belgian 
consumer may be paying a high price for the lack of well-functioning, competitive markets (Figure 2). 2 
The final prices of many retail goods appear somewhat higher than the euro area average while prices in 
network sectors also tend to be on the high side, motivating the review of competition-inhibiting regulation 
in Belgium. 1.

The figures presented do not take account of differences in VAT tax rates across countries. However, although 
the Belgian standard VAT rate is higher than in many euro area countries, the differences are of a small order 
of magnitude (on average 1.6 percentage point higher) and would not change the conclusion. Furthermore the 
Belgian VAT tax is characterised by a large number of reductions and exemptions (OECD, 2009). ECO/WKP(2009)77 6 Table 1. Productivity growth in the OECD Belgium Germany Netherlands France

The competition policy framework has notably improved over the past several years as 
legislation was adapted to EU standards (Box 1). The merger review threshold was raised, freeing up 
resources to deal with the cases of price fixing and abuse of dominant position. The reform also included 
changes in the institutional structure of the competition bodies. The Competition Authority is a so-called 
dual authority, consisting of the Directorate General of the Ministry of Economy (the investigative body) 
and the Competition Council (the administrative tribunal). The latter includes the Council (a court) and the 
College of Competition Prosecutors (the investigative and prosecuting body). Further reforms included 
putting in place a leniency programme and putting an end to the immunity from fines granted to 
associations of undertakings and professionals under the previous law. The reforms have started to yield 
visible results: cartel infringements have been found, the leniency programme has begun to work and cartel 
participants have been fined. Nevertheless, as the improvements to the framework are rather recent, it will 
take some time for the full effect on competition to be felt, however there still seems room for refining of 
the setup. Figure 1. Product market regulation in Belgium and the OECD 1 1.

previous setup produced little enforcement and that procedures took too long. The competition authorities were tied 
down in mandatory merger reviews with few resources for other competition matters. Out of nearly 200 matters 
between 1993 and 2005, barely a third resulted in a decision, and only one resulted in a fine. Most investigations were 
taking more than 2 years to complete, excluding cases that expired instead of having a formal closure decision. In 
matters other than interim measures and mergers from 1997-2001, the Council reached only one decision per year 
and the average time for cartel infringement proceedings was over six years. The Court of Audit found that the 
principle reasons for this state of affairs were, in addition to the resource requirements of the mandatory merger 
reviews, poor organization and the lack of support for a coherent policy of protecting competition to promote economic 
efficiency. The new competition law tracks the EU legislation based on the prohibition of anti competitive restrictive 
agreements and abuses of dominant positions and gives a legal basis for leniency. In addition, the latest 
EU substantive standard for mergers, which is based on the concept of a  " substantial impediment to effective 
competition, "  rather than solely a  " dominance "  test, is incorporated in the law. The reform did not introduce changes to 
the fines which can be imposed by the Authority, which can be as high as 10% of annual turnover. Staff at the 
Competition Authority is about 70 person years, which is the same as Switzerland, but less than in the Netherlands 
and the Nordic Countries. The 2006 reforms also modified the institutional structure. The Belgian Competition Authority is not a single 
integrated agency but a so-called  " dual authority " . It has two principal parts, the Competition Council and the 
Directorate General for Competition. The Council includes the general assembly of the Council (in a narrow sense), 
which is the decision making body for competition enforcement. The law authorises six full time and six part-time 
members (councillors), who are appointed by the government for six-year, renewable terms. The College of 
Competition Prosecutors (with a statutory maximum of ten members) is attached to the Council. The competition 
prosecutors initiate and direct investigations and present enforcement matters to the Council and rely upon the staff of 
the Directorate General for Competition for investigative and other support. There is therefore institutional separation 
between the investigation, prosecution and decision making powers within the authority. Unlike in some other 
countries, the Competition Authority is not responsible for consumer protection, which is the responsibility of the 
Directorate General for Market Regulation under the same ministry. There is also an advisory Commission for 
Competition in the Central Council for the Economy. Merger review procedures require advance notification and approval for transactions that involve a total turnover 
in Belgium of over EUR 100 million (and at least two of the undertakings concerned have turnover in Belgium 
exceeding EUR 40 million). These thresholds are more than twice the limits in the pre-reform procedures, inducing a 
substantial reduction in merger reviews. The competition authority is not fully independent in this area as the 
government can override a Council decision rejecting a merger allowing it to go forward  " for reasons of general interest 
which outweigh the risk of competition. "  It may also overrun any conditions imposed on the merger by the Competition 
Council. In particular, the Council of Ministers may consider matters of national security, international competitiveness, 
employment and consumer interests. This provision has not been used to date. The leniency programme was updated 
in October 2007 to make it consistent with now standard European practices, so a cartel member may be fully or partly 
exempted from sanctions for bringing the cartel to the attention of the enforcement authority, bringing in evidence the 
authority did not have, or admitting participation. In the first full year under the new competition regime (2007), the Council reached three cartel infringements 
decisions and considered six applications for leniency. In the second year, the number of decisions on cartel 
infringements rose to five and six applications for leniency were considered. The first cartel fine (of slightly below 
EUR 500 000) ever imposed under Belgian law was in early 2008 in a case that started with a leniency application. 
The relatively small fine reflects that the cartel ended in 2002 and the smallness of the market. A recent decision 
illustrates the importance of the recent changes to the statute. In July 2008, the Council ruled against a trade 
association  " ethical "  rule setting minimum fees (for interior designers), but could not impose a fine because the law in 
effect during the period of the violation, from 2002 to 2005, did not authorise fines against an association. Other small 
fines have been issued to trade associations to signal that co-ordination dampening price competition will no longer be 
acceptable. The Competition Council may end up with important functions in regulatory matters. As is usual elsewhere, it 
already acts in co-operation with sector regulators. Under the competition law, the Competition Council may also be 
empowered to decide appeals from decisions of sectoral regulators. This function will depend upon enactment of 
corresponding authorizations in the sector regulatory laws. The Directorate General has engaged in policy advocacy 
by issuing reports or opinions on taxicab regulation, real estate and interlocking directorates. ECO/WKP(2009)77 9 Figure 2. Comparative price levels¹ 2007, EU15 = 100 1. 
The PPPs are divided by the current nominal exchange rate to obtain a price level index (PLI) which expresses the price level of 
a given country relative to another, or relative to a group of countries like the EU15. Source: Eurostat database. 4. 
Although the independence of the Competition Authority has been strengthened (it is now 
financed through a separate line in the government's budget), the investigative part of the Authority 
continues to be a Directorate General inside the Ministry of Economy. The Directorate's resources remain 
largely determined by the federal government and a number of supporting costs (location, information and 
communication technology, etc.) are provided by the Ministry outside the budget line. Thus, the 
Competition Authority applies the centralised hiring procedures of the civil service and it remains 
physically located in the Ministry's building. Furthermore, the large backlog of old cases has led to 
problems in meeting legal deadlines and has forced the College of Prosecutors to prioritise cases. This has 
been done based on criteria, the origin of which have not been made sufficiently clear to the wider public, 
and may lead to accusations that political priorities affect the ranking of cases. Therefore, the situation 
should be monitored, in particular regarding the authority's degree of independence and accountability. If 
necessary, a potential improvement would entail giving the authority a status of a fully independent agency 
with a complete budget decided by the parliament and granted full freedom in hiring. In terms of 
improving the authority's perceived independence, physically moving out of the Ministry building and 
enhancing the transparency of the selection of the prioritisation criteria may be considered. Despite the 
reinforcements made in the past years, there are still signs the Competition Authority may be in need of 
additional resources. The current staffing may be reconsidered as it appears on the low side when 
compared with other small economies such as the Netherlands and the Nordic countries (Høj, 2007), and it 
has not proved sufficient for dealing with the large amount of old cases and court appeals against its 
decisions and for assuming a more proactive role. ECO/WKP(2009)77 10 5. 
There is a need for strong signalling of the Competition Authority's determination to enforce 
competition law. The fines imposed up to date have not been particularly high. However, in the future the 
Competition Authority will inevitably be dealing with larger cases in crucial sectors and the use of high 
fines will be desirable in order to signal the tough stance against infringements and to deter future 
uncompetitive practices. High fines will also increase the incentives to apply for leniency thereby 
facilitating the policing of cartels. Deterrence would be enhanced by introducing criminal sanctions such as 
prison sentences for hard-core cartel infringements. To enhance the Authority's effectiveness, clear and 
efficient communication procedures (in particular regarding confidential information) between the 
Authority and the sectoral regulators are essential. Finally, plans to establish the Council as the sole 
institution for appeal against sectoral regulator decisions are commendable. This is the case in many 
OECD countries, as the Council is well placed to rule on competition cases in the network sectors. If this is 
to increase the speed with which cases are settled it may imply the Council will need additional resources. 6. 
The notable progress in the reform of the Competition Authority does not appear to be coupled 
with comparable developments in the regulation of the network sectors (see the sections below). In order to 
fulfil the government's goal of stimulating economic activity and improving consumer welfare through the 
strengthening of competition in Belgian markets, a determined approach to competition policy needs to be 
implemented and enforced at all levels of regulation (SPF Economie, 2008). The government has recently 
created a price observatory which will aim at increasing the price transparency in the market, but care 
should be taken in order not to further complicate the regulatory structure and to minimise the risk of this 
authority becoming a price setter. Competition in retail distribution is burdened by heavy regulation 7. 
The retail sector in Belgium is characterised by a relatively large number of small shops 
(Figure 3), a structure that may have a number of advantages in terms of accessibility. However, at the 
same time, the employment share of the sector is below the average of the OECD countries (Figure 4, 
Panel A) pointing to a relatively large scope for jobs creation. Moreover, productivity in the sector has 
been growing slower than in most OECD countries (Figure 4, Panel B and Biatour and Kegels, 2008). 3 
Finally, the price levels of many of the goods associated with retail distribution are notably higher than in 
other euro area countries (Figure 2). At the same time, the sector is much more regulated than in most other 
OECD countries, especially in the areas of protection of existing firms, specific regulation of large outlets 
and shop opening hours (Figure 1, Panel B). This regulation shields existing shops from competitive 
pressures which in many cases leads to the protection of local monopolies (Høj et al. 1995 provides 
evidence on the relation between regulation, prices and size of shops). Therefore, deregulation of retail 
distribution can be expected to boost productivity. This conclusion is backed by the results of OECD 
simulations, which show that Belgium is among the countries with the highest potential gains from the 
liberalisation of the retail sector (Box 2). Hence, as retail trade is an inherently competitive sector, scaling 
back the regulation should benefit consumer welfare. A number of studies have shown that lowering entry 
barriers can increase the efficiency of retail trade leading both to lower prices (Pilat, 1997, Haffner and 
van Bergeijk, 1997) and higher employment (Bertrand and Kramarz, 2002; CPB, 1995; Creusen 
et al, 2006). The scope for the increase in employment in the sector should not be overlooked in the 3. 
Although labour productivity growth in the Belgian distribution sector (which consists of wholesale and 
retail trade and repair shops) has been slow in the past decades, there are findings that the actual level of 
productivity in Belgian distribution is among the highest in the OECD (Inklaar and Timmer, 2008). The 
main reason for the low productivity growth is the low growth rate of total factor productivity. The high 
productivity levels are due to very high capital intensity (both information and communication technology 
capital and other types of capital). This may seem somewhat in contrast with the fact that the Belgian retail 
sector is characterised by a large amount of small shops. Partial explanations for this phenomenon may 
include the wide definition of the sector, encompassing far more than just retail trade and the relatively 
restricted opening hours (due to opening hour regulation and working hour regulation). ECO/WKP(2009)77 11 Belgian context, given the fact that these are likely to be jobs for low skilled workers and for flexible 
part-time workers, such as females returning to the labour market. Figure 3. The retail sector is characterised by a large share of small shops 2003-2005 averages¹ 1.

Box 3 provides a detailed overview of the main restrictions to competition in the Belgian retail 
sector, which generally protect existing shops, in particular those of smaller size, from the entry of new 
innovative business models. The prohibition of sales below costs prevents retailers from easily selling 
unwanted stocks, increasing the risk for new entrants. The ban on announcements of price reductions 
before sales periods ( " the black-out period " ) reduces consumers access to information on prices, while the 
prohibition of tied sales (better known in Belgium as  " joint-sales " ) inhibits the diffusion of innovative 
products or new technology (in April 2009 the European Court of Justice declared this law as incompatible 
with European legislation). The government is currently working on the modification of most of the above 
regulation. The changes proposed so far do not appear substantial. As the Competition Authority should 
deal with the abuse of dominant position, the restrictions on prices and assortment should be scrapped 
altogether. In order to improve consumer welfare, providing consumers with the possibility of shopping 
outside standard hours and the retailers with flexibility to better meet consumer demand, the shop opening 
hour regulation, which is among the more restrictive in the OECD, should be abandoned. Finally, zoning 
regulation for large outlets, which was reformed in 2005 resulting in a faster decision making process, 
should be restricted to issues of urban planning, transport and safety (in line with the recent 
recommendation from the Ministry of Economy, SPF Economie, 2008). This would allow market forces, 
rather than a nation-wide committee with a strong representation of existing retailers or the local 
municipality, to decide on the consumers' benefits arising from a new retail outlet. ECO/WKP(2009)77 12 Box 2. Anti-competitive regulation and labour productivity – OECD simulations OECD calculations report that aligning sectoral regulation (in retail trade, electricity and gas and professional 
services) with international best practice would boost labour productivity in the entire economy by nearly 16% over the 
next decade. Reforms in the retail sector only, could raise productivity by almost 12% if regulation was brought in line 
with OECD best practice. Similarly, for reforms in the energy sector, productivity is calculated to increase by 3.5%, 
which is well above the average of the countries analysed (Table 2). Table 2. The simulated effect of liberalisation on labour productivity in the future Simulated percentage increase in productivity over 10 years Sectors simulated All sectors

ECO/WKP(2009)77 14 Box 3. Examples of competition restricting regulation in retail distribution Price and transparency control  Sales below costs are prohibited outside the sales season or liquidation of the outlet and the sale season is limited to two periods of one month each year. This type of regulation limits retailers' flexibility and reduces their ability to get rid of unwanted stock, thereby constituting 
an implicit deterrent to entry and reducing consumer welfare. Moreover, the definitions of costs and minimum margins are 
cumbersome and the verification problematic, especially for start-ups with no history of costs.  Announcements of price reductions within 6 weeks before the sales period are prohibited ( " the black-out period " ). It is also prohibited to announce reductions which are to take place during these 6 weeks. The black-out period legislation reduces price transparency and impedes the consumers' access to a full set of price 
information for their choice.  Tied sales of products are prohibited. This regulation aims at disallowing the cross-subsidising of products (or products and services), to enhance 
transparency. It protects smaller retailers who may have less scope to offer products tied together and has notably increased 
the complexity of retail regulation. Many exceptions have been granted, for example for the sale of an ensemble (e.g. frames 
with lenses) or for the sale of a product together with its packing. As the notion of an ensemble is unclear a priori, the law 
increases uncertainty for new products and hampers the diffusion of new technology. Regulation of opening hours  Shops may be open on weekdays between 5h and 20h, on Fridays (and days preceding holidays) till 21h. They have to be closed for one period of 24 hours a week (by default Sundays, though any day of the week can be 
chosen as long as it is kept the same for at least six months.) The law allows for an additional opening during 
6 Sundays a year.  Exemptions include: small shops linked to gas stations, night shops (under 150m2, selling groceries and hygienic materials may be open 18h-7h) and shops in designated tourist areas.  The law foresees fines, shop closure and prison penalties for infringement and is enforced by state officials. Restrictions on shop opening hours protect existing retailers, in particular small night shops, against new innovative 
business models. Such regulation also limits the retailers' ability to adjust to changes in consumer demand and hurts 
consumer welfare by reducing the ability to choose when to do shopping. In Belgium, such regulation is aimed at enhancing 
workers' welfare despite its potential employment-reducing effects. Regulation of large outlets  The location decision is based on the evaluation of four types of possible effects: i) spatial effect (urban planning, access and road safety); ii) on consumer interests (product range and prices); iii) on employment (gross and in 
existing commerce); and iv) on the balance between small, medium and large commerce.  Decisions for shops between 400-1000m 2 of surface are taken by the municipality, while for shops above 1000m 2 the National Economic and Social Committee for Retail has to be consulted. In case of surfaces above 2000m 2 the 
neighbouring municipalities have to be consulted.  The Economic and Social Committee is composed of representatives of ministries, regions, consumer associations, labour organisations, independent retailers and SME's and integrated commerce.  The decision must be made and communicated within a maximum of 75 days and can be appealed against to the Inter-ministerial Committee for Retail (Comité Interministériel pour la Distribution). Silence is consent. Zoning regulation may be desirable due to issues of urban planning, traffic congestion and security, but is often used to 
protect existing retailers against new entrants. As emphasised in OECD (2008), the evaluation of consumer interests should 
be left to the consumers themselves, who will ultimately decide whether the new business serves them better than the 
existing ones through their shopping choices. Other regulation  Further strict regulations concern advertising, specific retail sectors (e.g. pharmaceuticals) and sales at the home of the customer. ECO/WKP(2009)77 15 Regulators in network industries are faced with dominant positions of incumbents 9. 
The liberalisation in the network sectors remains limited. The degree of opening is patchy and the 
diversity of regulatory structures complicates regulation (Box 4). There exists no uniform definition of 
regulatory bodies. The role of network sector regulation and the lack of coordination between the sectoral 
regulators and the Competition Authority have been identified as the most serious issues of the design of 
the Belgian system (SPF Economie, 2008). Another important issue concerns the unusually wide scope of 
universal services which poses a barrier to entry and the expansion of competitors, while benefiting the 
incumbents due to problematic schemes for financing. The universal service obligations (USOs) are 
summarised in Box 5 and their effect on competition is discussed below. Box 4. Regulation of network sectors The regulation of network sectors in Belgium differs substantially across the individual sectors. In general, the 
Competition Authority deals with the cases of the abuse of dominant position and cartel pricing in competitive sectors 
and the competitive segments of the network sectors. Non-discriminatory third party access to monopoly segments is 
the competence of sectoral regulators which have various structures and varying degrees of independence from the 
executive and different sources of financing. The network sector regulators are usually also in charge of issuing market 
entry licenses, assuring universal services and having some advisory tasks as regards sector strategies. The energy sectors (electricity and gas) are regulated by a single federal authority, the Commission for Electricity 
and Gas Regulation (known by its French and Flemish abbreviation CREG), and three regional authorities. The federal 
regulatory tasks concern mainly the approval of transmission and distribution tariffs (in both gas and electricity) and 
advising the government in the other segments of the markets. In the electricity market, its regulatory powers are 
limited to transmission and distribution networks above a certain threshold (70kV). The federal authority's independence seems in line with OECD best practice: CREG has its own budget which is 
funded through a surcharge on customer utility bills securing it from potential political intervention, although the 
management remains nominated by the government. On the other hand, regional regulators are responsible for 
appointing distribution network operators in gas and distribution grid operators in electricity, issuing retail supply 
licenses, ensuring the implementation of universal service obligations and advising the regional governments. The 
independence of the regional regulatory authorities from the sub-national levels of government does not seem as well 
assured as in the case of the federal regulator. In principle, sub-national level regulators may be better prepared to deal with regional regulatory tasks as they 
may be better prepared to deal with issues of local distribution and supply as well as consumer needs due to their local 
knowledge and relative proximity to the final market. However such a structure may cause problems of regulatory 
powers (overlap of powers, lack of regulatory coverage of certain segments, lack of economies of scale) and 
coordination (both of the objectives and of enforcement decisions). This structure may lead to lengthy communication 
procedures and increase bureaucracy. Three regulatory environments are an additional entry cost for competitors and 
this structure has been frequently criticised (IEA, 2006). One of the effects of the set-up was the different progress in 
the legal opening of the electricity market for consumer choice, which was functional in Flanders in 2003, while taking 
until 2007 in Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital region. The telecommunication and postal sectors are regulated by the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and 
Telecommunication (BIPT). The regulator's independence was strengthened in 2003, formerly being part of the 
Ministry which executed ownership powers in the incumbent. Financing is assured mainly through licensing fees. 
Despite the improvement, some controversies about the issue of independence remain: the members of the Council 
(decision making body), including the head, are nominated and can be dismissed on the proposal of the executive. 
There remains some uncertainty about the possibility of the government to overturn BIPT decisions and about the 
political influence on the regulators priorities (Platform, 2007). Contrary to the energy markets, the regulatory tasks are 
concentrated in a federal body; however there seems to be pressure from the language-Community level regulators 
(who have competencies over broadcasting content) to gain regulatory powers over infrastructure common to 
broadcasting and telecommunication (e.g. internet). In 2006, these resulted in a cooperation agreement which laid 
down the procedures for resolving disputes of joint competencies, causing some concern due to the increased scope 
for bureaucratic consultation and leaving decision power over unresolved issues at the ministerial level, thereby 
somewhat weakening the regulator. In November 2008, the federal government proposed measures to strengthen the 
regulator: the procedure for imposing a fine is to become easier, and fines may become higher. BIPT is to acquire 
more powers for intervention in the market. In the cases that occur, its defence before the Court of Appeal is to 
become less elaborate. ECO/WKP(2009)77 16 The energy sector: strong incumbents and high implicit barriers to entry Electricity 10. 
The liberalisation of the energy market essentially began in April 1999 with the transposition of 
the first EU electricity and gas directives. The second EU directives were transposed in June 2005 while 
the electricity market for households was fully legally opened on 1 st June 2003 in Flanders. Wallonia and 
Brussels-Capital followed on 1 st January 2007 when supplier choice was granted to all consumers. Despite 
the liberalisation, electricity prices remained well above those in OECD countries with the most 
competitive electricity markets (Figure 5). Moreover, energy prices have been found to contribute strongly 
to the large positive inflation differential between Belgium and the euro area in late 2008. 4 11. 
Historically, all segments of the electricity market have been concentrated in the hands of Suez 
and Gaz de France. Following their merger, the companies agreed with the European Commission to 
reduce their involvement in certain segments (Box 6). However, most of the segments of the market are set 
to remain highly concentrated in the hands of the merged company GDF-Suez. As now only legal 
separation of the transmission operator and accounting separation of other segments are required, the 
government's efforts to strengthen separation, including a favourable stance towards the introduction of 
ownership separation of transmission network operators are commendable. Notably, the government has 
taken steps to encourage auctioning off some of the incumbent's spare capacity which are yielding results 
(for example in late 2008 the incumbent agreed to sell 10% of Belgian production capacity) and efforts to 
introduce new players should therefore be continued. Nonetheless, a number of additional barriers to entry 
should be removed in order to encourage new competitors as the sector remains burdened by more 
competition-restricting regulation than international best practice (Figure 6, Panel A). The wholesale 
exchange pool, established in 2006, has failed to play a significant role (in 2008, only about 13% of daily 
electricity consumption was traded on the day-ahead market 5 ), despite that such a measure has proven 
beneficial for competition in a number of OECD countries. The lack of liquidity and high prices on the 
wholesale market have deterred entry in the supply market and therefore further efforts to increase 
interconnection capacity is desirable to enhance competition. Moreover, although the retail electricity 
prices are not regulated, most suppliers choose to use a variation of a cost indexation formula calculated by 
the federal regulator (CREG), which was used historically to determine the regulated price before the 
markets were liberalised. The publication of the components by CREG should be ceased, as they bring 
little value added while posing the risk of the regulator acting as a price coordinator on the retail market. 
As this formula is based, among others, on the Zeebrugge hub spot gas price and available nuclear plant 
capacity, both of which can be strongly influenced by the incumbent companies, increased vertical 
separation in the market should ensure this is not the case. The transmission and distribution tariffs are 
accompanied by high uncertainty, undermining potential new business models of new entrants. Switching 
to multi-annual tariffs for transmission (in 2008) and distribution (in 2009) are significant steps towards a 
more stable environment, however the legal uncertainty related to the details of the introduction of such 4. 
The favourable development in 2007 has been due to a transmission and distribution tariff decrease 
imposed by the federal regulator, which was later annulled by the court on the grounds of the regulator 
exceeding its competencies. The decreases of electricity (and gas) prices in 2007 relative to other countries 
have been reversed as a result of the tariff increase ranging from below 10% in Wallonia (where they 
remain the highest) to almost 50% in Flanders (where they still remain the lowest). This caused final 
energy prices to increase sharply. The 22% inflation (year-on-year) of Belgian energy prices in 
September 2008, is estimated to have been only 13% if not for the change in distribution tariffs, and 
below 8% (in line with Euro area average) if additionally capacity was kept at 2007 levels. Of the 
1.8 percentage point differential in headline inflation between Belgium and the euro area (September 2008) 
1.2 percentage points can be explained by gas and electricity price increases (NBB, 2008). 5. 
Monthly variation can be considerable, e.g. in May 2008 the traded volumes reached a third of Belgian 
demand. ECO/WKP(2009)77 17 legislation has, so far, undermined its effect. Another example of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs was 
when the lowering of tariffs by CREG led to an appeal against its decisions and its subsequent annulment 
in 2008. This resulted in a number of suggestions that the regulator needs additional tariff-setting powers in 
the distribution segments (NBB, 2008). Figure 5. Electricity and gas prices Pre-tax 1.

Another potentially important deterrent to entry is the complicated regulatory structure (Box4) 
which effectively divides Belgium into three separate energy markets, thereby increasing entrants' (fixed) 
costs. The federal regulator seems sufficiently independent and equipped to regulate the areas within its 
competence. In April 2008, the government increased the investigative powers of its officials and thus 
improved the toolset of the federal regulator. However, the set-up of the regional regulators does not seem 
as well developed. Firstly, their independence does not seem as well secured, as they are financed directly 
by regional government budgets, while the senior staff is appointed by the regional government, and their 
objectives are not necessarily in line with each other nor with those of the federal body. Secondly, although 
regional regulators in downstream segments may, in principle, be better equipped to fulfil their tasks, being 
closer to the final consumer, such a structure risks unnecessary bureaucratic delays in communication and ECO/WKP(2009)77 18 the loss of economies of scale, in particular in the Belgian context where divided regulators are dealing 
with a very concentrated market. In addition, there is a risk that regional regulators may be more prone to 
regulatory capture, in particular given their weak independence from the governments and the strong 
involvement of municipalities in distribution networks. 6 Therefore the regulatory structure should be 
revisited and the regulatory tasks should be concentrated in one authority. As a second best, strong 
independence and sufficient powers of the regional regulators need to be secured, while the current 
voluntary dialogue forum should be replaced by a binding co-operation and co-ordination framework 
between regulators of all levels is necessary and to align their priorities. Finally, universal service 
obligations appear overly broad and may deter entry due to a higher cost of adapting to the regional 
specificities (Box5). In order for them not to constitute a barrier to new competitors, regional authorities 
wishing to conduct additional social policy based on energy provision, should purchase energy within their 
own budget or use transfer policies instead of the regulated tariffs. Gas 13. 
Gas is imported mainly through the Zeebrugge hub and LNG terminal. Roughly one half of the 
households use gas for heating and cooking and the role of gas in the generation of electricity, is set to 
increase significantly over the coming two decades (IEA, 2006). A number of issues concerning the gas 
sector are also common to the electricity sector, and thus have already been discussed in the previous 
section. The sector was liberalised in a similar time frame as the electricity sector. Gas prices were 
generally near the EU average until 2007, but as in electricity the subsequent fall was due to a regulatory 
lowering of tariffs, which were annulled in 2008 (Figure 5). 14. 
The main regulatory problems in the gas market concern high implicit barriers to new entry and 
the resulting strong position of the incumbent, while explicit entry barriers are low (Figure 6, Panel B). The 
gas market is highly concentrated (GDF and Suez) and the commitments accompanying the merger of the 
two companies are unlikely to improve the situation (Box 6). As a result, the transmission network 
capacity has been, to a large extent, unavailable to new entrants as it was contracted out for very long time 
periods. Measures to resolve this situation have been imposed by the Commission in late 2007 (EC, 2007a 
and 2007b) however it will take time to evaluate whether they are sufficient. Moreover, installing a well 
functioning wholesale pool for natural gas, which has proved to benefit competition in a number of OECD 
countries, is recommended. 7 Given the strong position of GDF-Suez in various segments of both the gas 
and electricity markets, regulatory efforts should be increased to ensure that the legal interdiction of 
cross-subsidisation within the same company, both between the different segments of the gas market as 
well as between gas and electricity products, is respected. As in electricity, the law currently requires legal 
separation of the transmission and distribution segments and accounts separation of the other segments. 
The introduction of mandatory vertical ownership separation between different segments or of 
strengthening the existing formal separation, in line with the government's proposals, would be a desirable 
step. In this light, the government should continue its efforts to make sure that the main market players do 
not have a blocking minority participation in the ownership structure of the Zeebrugge hub and the LNG 
terminal. This should be done with the goal of assuring non-discriminatory third party access to the 
terminals and to transmission capacity from the terminals, which has proven a serious problem in the past. 
The Ministry of Energy is currently working on this issue, as part of the new Code of Conduct on third 
party access to the gas network. 6. 
The municipalities have a legal monopoly in electricity distribution, and nearly all of them transferred the 
distribution to inter-municipal companies (intercommunales). The income from the energy-related 
activities constitutes an important figure in the municipal budgets reaching 10% of the revenues. 7. 
Although APX Zee (a within-day and day-ahead gas trading platform) already exists, its role is negligible 
with a total of 33 transactions done in the whole of 2008, of which 11 since February. ECO/WKP(2009)77 19 Box 5. Universal services in energy, telecoms and post Universal service obligations (USOs) are intended to assure the universal access to a designated service at a specified quality 
and an affordable price. In practice however, they may serve as a barrier to deter new entrants, securing of an incumbent's position or 
a subsidy for the latter. In general each World Trade Organisation member has the right to set the desired scope of USO. The specific 
rules for EU member states are set out in the Universal Service Directive (for telecoms) and in the Postal Directive. In general USO's, 
if constituting a cost to the supplier, must be compensated for with profits made in other markets. They can be financed directly from 
the government budget (through the acquisition of a service), from a fund to which market participants contribute (e.g. pay or play 
fund) or through a designated segment of the market (e.g. through the reserved area in postal services, through distribution tariffs in 
distribution). In Belgium no uniform approach to universal services exists. While provisions for auctioning off some of the services to the 
provider with best offers exist, other services are imposed on all operators. The scope of universal service tends to be unusually 
broad in all sectors while differing across regions (Table 3). Table 3. Universal service obligations in Belgium By network sector Sector

tendering social tariffs as these are imposed on all providers and funded through a fund to 
which all market participants contribute. There are no legal tools to assess that the 
USO provision actually constitutes an unfair burden, which would justify the additional 
financing. The European Commission has launched an infringement procedure and has 
recently taken Belgium to the European Court of Justice. Post

The Gaz de France – Suez merger and concentration on the Belgian energy market The merger between Gaz de France (GDF) and Suez was announced in February 2006 and due to its 
large-scale characteristics was subject to the EU regulation regarding limits on concentration. The Commission 
authorised the deal in November 2006, amid concerns regarding the large role of the new company in specific 
markets. Before the deal, the two companies had strong positions in the Belgian energy markets, thus the merger 
posed problems of further increasing the concentration of the already highly concentrated energy sector. In order to 
receive the approval of the merger by the European Commission the companies made a number of commitments 
regarding the Belgian markets (Table 4). Table 4. The Belgian energy market and GDF-Suez Concentration before and after the merger Segment of

Productivity growth in the telecommunication sector was well below that in most other OECD 
countries (Table 1) and consumers were often forced to pay higher prices than in neighbouring countries 
and the introduction of new technologies was lagging. Although explicit barriers to entry do not seem to be 
a problem in most segments of the market (Figure 6, Panel C), one of the most visible issues is the high 
concentration of the sector. Fixed telephony 16. 
Following the liberalisation of telecommunications on 1 st January 1998, new entrants have not 
been able to gain a strong position in some of the key segments of the market, which remained 
concentrated in the hands of the majority state-owned incumbent Belgacom. Belgian broadband offers 
remain on the expensive side in comparison to other OECD countries (Figure 7). Moreover, a particular 
feature of the Belgian broadband is that practically all offers have monthly download quotas (bit-caps) 
which tend to be lower than in other countries. This further raises the price of internet usage as exceeding 
the quota entails an additional cost. 8 Furthermore, the Belgian consumer does not have access to top 
technology (e.g. fibre-to-the-home) and the advertised speeds remain well below the fastest offers in 
leading OECD countries (Figure 8). As a result, broadband penetration, among the highest in the OECD 
in 2002, has since been growing slowly and is lower than in many countries (though still above average). 
Finally, the Belgian consumer pays an excessive price for triple-play offers (broadband, TV and telephone) 
while the offers are of inferior quality (Table 5 shows a comparison with France, where the regulator has 
been particularly active in the telecom market). 17. 
Broadband is provided mainly through DSL lines and to a smaller, but still internationally high, 
extent via cable. Local loop unbundling (LLU) of cable networks is technically infeasible and due to the 
high concentration in the cable sector, this technology has failed to put sufficient competitive pressure on 
the incumbent's DSL offer. In DSL itself, the main alternatives to the incumbent's offer are provided via 
bitstream (renting capacity from the incumbent and reselling it) which is incapable of challenging the 
incumbent's position as it does not allow for sufficient differentiation of products (e.g. providing television 
over internet). Overall, the level of local loop unbundling of DSL lines is very low when compared with 
OECD countries with a liberalised market, despite a comparable regulated price of provision. 9 Until 2007 
this was largely a consequence of high (regulated) prices of unbundling, which have since been lowered to 
internationally low levels (EC, 2008a). Nevertheless the latter development has failed to benefit the final 
consumer. Part of the explanation is historical and the effects of lower tariffs should eventually be felt. 
However, many costs related to unbundling remain high (e.g. collocation, installation and de-installation) 
increasing the cost of entry. Secondly, for a number of years, the incumbent has failed to comply with 8. 
Caps generally prevail in countries where geography limits the connection to the rest of the world 
(e.g. located on islands) and in principle Belgium's location does not explain the prevalence of caps. 
In 2008 only four OECD countries had 100% of offers with caps (Australia, New Zealand, Canada and 
Belgium) while Iceland and Ireland had a domination of offers with caps (OECD broadband portal). The 
average level of caps in Belgium was the second lowest in the OECD, of a range comparable with only 
New Zealand (on average 20GB in 2008, but being as low as 250 MB in the low-end offers). Belgian 
bit-caps are reached relatively fast, compared to the advertised maximum download speed and may impose 
a higher de facto charge for high users. In mid-2008 one challenging provider started offering uncapped 
downloads, but has since been followed by only one competitor (in December 2008). 9. 
By January 2008, out of over 1.6 million DSL lines, less than 40 000, that is 2.5% of the total, were fully 
unbundled. In contrast, 18% of lines are unbundled on average in the EU 27, 31% in Germany, 23% in 
France and 10% in the Netherlands. Shared access lines constitute slightly above 1% of total lines in 
Belgium. ECO/WKP(2009)77 23 requirements concerning the timing and quality of provisioning and servicing of lines, and the regulator 
has failed to enforce these obligations. 10 Furthermore, the incumbent has appealed against almost all of 
BIPT's decisions and cases get held up in the Court of Appeal or in some cases at the Competition Council 
for a relatively long time given the dynamic nature of the sector. In the end BIPT's decisions were often 
annulled on formal grounds, increasing uncertainty for new entrance (Platform, 2007). Such developments 
create an implicit barrier for new entrants, who face high uncertainty regarding the quality of services 
provided by the incumbent, and therefore potential problems with assuring a high quality of the end 
product. Table 5. Triple-play is significantly more expensive than in France Company Internet connection

The regulator generally has refrained from fining Belgacom. As regards local loop unbundling, by 
July 2006 BIPT registered numerous complaints from the alternative operators about Belgacom not 
meeting legal deadlines for line installation and service works. Instead of adopting a tough stance on the 
violations BIPT effectively doubled legal time limits for Belgacom. This decision had an adverse impact 
on consumer welfare instead of forcing the incumbent to devote additional resources to LLU and servicing. 
The penalties for exceeding the maximum timeline were revised, detaching them from the monthly rental 
fee, however they have been capped at relatively low levels. Since then the timing schedules are to be 
reduced gradually, however despite recent improvements, Belgacom still seems to have problems fulfilling 
them, but uses inevitable deviations from the forecasts on LLU which the competitors are obliged to 
provide in order to avoid fines. Similarly, Belgacom's competitors give details on the problems BIPT has 
experienced in forcing Belgacom to include ADSL2+ in to its reference offer for bit stream (despite 
persistent refusal to fulfil BIPT's request no fine was issued). Only recently (July 2008) a EUR 3 million 
was issued for failing to comply with BIPT's decision on mobile phone charges. ECO/WKP(2009)77 24 Figure 7. Broadband internet is relatively expensive 1 Price per unit of maximum download speed

The regulatory and legal framework was earlier criticised for lacking a consistent and systematic 
approach and giving the impression of improvisation (Dehousse and Zgajewski, 2003). The regulator's 
powers still seem somewhat weaker when compared with the OECD best practice. Firstly, what is rather 
unusual, dispute settlement is outside its competencies and is carried out by the Competition Council. 
Second, the regulator appears to have fewer tools available to enforce its decisions than for 
example regulators in Finland, Sweden and Spain (ECTA, 2008). BIPT is unable to impose periodic 
penalties to ensure compliance, to suspend an introduction of an offer until the ex ante obligations are 
fulfilled and is tied up by a strict confidentiality law. 11 Moreover, although BIPT's independence was 
improved in 2003, there are indications it may still need strengthening in particular given the controlling 
share of the state in the incumbent (Box 4). As a consequence, Belgacom is a significant contributor to the 
federal budget, which leads to a potential conflict of interest: the state is a regulator in charge of promoting 
competition and the state benefits from the incumbent's profits. Therefore, the privatisation of Belgacom 
would further clarify the incentives to empower the sectoral regulator. In the past years, a number of 
sources have accused the regulator of being under political influence (Platform, 2007, ECTA, 2008, 
Test-Achats, 2007, 2008) and of neglecting the enforcement of local loop unbundling (Platform, 2007). 
Each of these issues should be reviewed and addressed, so that the regulator can take an active part in 
promoting competition on the telecom market in order to bring telecommunication productivity growth 
more in line with other OECD countries and to allow consumers to benefit from lower prices and better 
offers. This should be done primarily through a tough stance on the incumbent's violations, including a 
determined use of fines in order to lower implicit entry costs and encourage LLU. Furthermore, any 
pressures to dilute the regulatory powers, for example due to the overlaps of competencies with the 
Community-level broadcast content regulators, should be strongly resisted. Notably, the government is 
preparing a reform which should improve the powers of the regulator (Box 4). 19. 
Another important issue is the imposition of social tariffs on all the operators in fixed line 
telephony and their funding (Box 5). The implementation of the social tariffs has raised numerous 
problems, including the problems of competitors' access to the database which would allow the 
verification of eligibility (Platform, 2007) which now seems to have been solved. Moreover the 
compensation mechanism seems not to be in line with the EU's Universal Service Directive as there are no 
legal instruments to establish whether provision of social tariffs constitutes an unfair burden. Due to the 
larger share of those benefiting from social tariffs among Belgacom's clients, the fund risks being an 
effective subsidy to the incumbent. If the government is determined to pursue the social tariff element of 
universal service, it should consider periodically auctioning off the service in a competitive bid, or at the 
least obliging the regulator to conduct investigations whether this service constitutes an unfair burden, 
equipping it with the necessary legal tools. Last but not least, there could be concerns for the future 
development of competition in the market if Belgacom upgrades its network using VDSL, since this 
technology increases the cost of unbundling for new entrants. Therefore the regulator needs to examine 
how to ensure competition with this technology (steps in this direction would include assuring access to 
passive infrastructure and backhaul facilities). It is also desirable to encourage the development of 
fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) technology. Mobile telephony 20. 
Mobile call charges in Belgium tend to be on the expensive side: low-usage charges appear close 
to the OECD average, despite an internationally high number of virtual operators (MVNO's) and resellers 
targeting this market, while high-usage prices are among the most expensive (Figure 9). Mobile phone 
penetration is among the lowest in the EU, showing little signs of catching up. The market is divided 11. 
For example, the decision whether data passed on to BIPT is confidential or not is left to its author. No 
motivation must be given, and the regulator cannot challenge this decision, thus the use of obtained data 
may be limited. ECO/WKP(2009)77 26 between three network operators, including the dominant player Proximus, which is owned by the fixed 
telephony incumbent, Belgacom. 12 The numerous resellers and MVNO's (above 25), contrary to other 
countries, have failed to gain a significant market share and to bring down the price of mobile calls (the 
combined market share remained below 1% by 2008, EC, 2008a). Mobile termination charges, despite 
being lowered in 2008, remain well above those in competitive markets like the United Kingdom, Sweden 
and Finland. Moreover, in 2008 the College of Competition Prosecutors has found evidence of the abuse of 
dominant position by Belgacom Mobile (in the period 2002-2005) and the case is currently pending before 
the Council (the complaint was filed in 2005). The incumbent's appeals against the lowering of termination 
charges lead to lengthy legal procedures in the Court of Appeal and significantly increase uncertainty for 
resellers. Figure 9. Prices for mobile phone calls tend to be high Total price in USD, February 2008 1. 
The OECD basket of mobile telephone charges (high usage) includes subscription and usage (1680 minutes of voice calls, 660 
SMS messages and 12 MMS, distributed between peak and off-peak hours and based on an average call duration) over a one-
year period. Calling patterns were all determined through extensive discussions with carriers across the OECD.

The regulator should focus on lowering mobile termination rates to meet the levels in the most 
competitive markets. In order to assure that the business models of the resellers are not undermined by 
uncertainty related to the incumbent challenging the regulator's decisions, the court cases should be 
speeded up in order to assure that they better match the dynamic nature of the sector. This should be 
achieved through appointing the Competition Council as the institution of appeal against all decision of the 
regulator, which may possibly require increasing the Council's resources. In order for the reduction of 12. 
The three market players are Proximus (owned by Belgian fixed-line incumbent Belgacom) with 45-49% 
of the market according to different estimates, Mobistar (owned by the French incumbent France Telecom) 
with 31-34% of the market and BASE (owned by the Dutch incumbent KPN) with the remaining share of 
around 20%. ECO/WKP(2009)77 27 mobile termination rates to benefit the final consumer, sufficient competitive pressure on retail and 
wholesale prices must be assured. A desirable step in this direction, already under consideration by the 
government is the introduction of the fourth network license. To facilitate the expansion of resellers and 
the potential new operator, the long length of service contracts should be reduced by limiting their 
maximum duration. The process for number portability should be streamlined to reduce the time taken to 
port a number. As for the social tariffs, the benefits of the extension to mobile phones are disputable 
(EC, 2006). As in fixed telephony, if the government considers social tariffs desirable, it should consider 
periodically auctioning off the service in a competitive bid and pay for it directly from the budget. Liberalisation in postal services and rail transport in lagging 22. 
The liberalisation of both the rail transport and postal services market is proceeding slowly, in 
line with the requirements of the European Commission. The latter stipulates the eventual full opening of 
both markets to competition: rail transport by January 2010 and postal services by January 2011. In the 
postal services sector, while competition seems to be well in place in the courier services, it is practically 
non-existent in the addressed letter segment (van der Lijn et al., 2008). As a consequence, despite the 
favourable characteristics of a relatively evenly spread, dense population, Belgian consumers suffer from 
higher prices, in particular for letters, and from a poorer quality of services that in most neighbour 
countries (Deutsche Post, 2008 and EC, 2008b). The sectoral regulator has, according to some sources, 
been perceived as inactive in the field of postal services (Baeke, 2008). Indeed the quality criteria agreed 
with the State have not been met by the incumbent, but no sanctions were issued. Although the situation is 
expected to improve as new sorting centres have been put in place, sanctions for the violation of preset 
quality standards should be significant and automatic, leading to stronger incentives to improve the quality 
of services. Moreover, new entry may be deterred by a number of additional Belgium-specific regulations. 
These include a VAT exemption on certain services provided by the incumbent and a particularly broad 
range of universal service obligations (Box 5). The former distorts the market, biasing the incumbent 
towards servicing the residential market and the competitors towards the business market while the 
broadness of USO's leads to a high cost of provision. 13 This may result in the subsidisation of the 
incumbent who, even in a fully liberalised market, will remain the only player with sufficient infrastructure 
to provide the broad USO's. Thus it would be desirable that each of the services currently included in the 
USO bundle, if deemed indispensable by the government, to be separately auctioned off according to best 
offer. Until then, the pricing should fully take into account the benefits of brand display. 23. 
As concerns rail transport, virtually no steps have been taken towards opening the passenger 
transport market to competition. The freight market is legally open for international connections since 
January 2006 and one year later for national connections, but remains strongly dominated by the 
state-owned incumbent. The publicly owned incumbent consists of the monopolist passenger transport 
service provider, the dominant freight service provider and the infrastructure operator. The passenger and 
freight segments have separate accounts while the infrastructure operator is required to be legally separated 
from the service providers. However, this separation is incomplete due to overlaps in terms of high level 
personnel. The sectoral regulator, which remains an agency within the Ministry of Transport, is in need of 
strengthening and more independence in order to assure non-discriminatory third party access to tracks, 
slots and marshalling facilities. Moreover at the moment, passenger connections are negotiated between the 
infrastructure operator, the monopoly service provider and the state which has a monopsonistic position. 13. 
The lack of VAT on postal services provided by La Poste in the area subject to USO gives an advantage to 
the incumbent towards customers unable to reclaim their VAT (mainly households) and a disadvantage 
towards other customers. Households, pay the nominal price on which the incumbent does not pay VAT. 
Business customers also pay the nominal price but they can reclaim the VAT from the competitors' price 
while not from the incumbent's price. Moreover, as the incumbent uses inputs subject to VAT, it cannot 
reclaim the tax when offering a service not subject to value added taxation. ECO/WKP(2009)77 28 Once the market is liberalised lower levels of governments should be empowered to purchase desired 
services (as for example in Germany) to introduce a more market-based provision of services. 
Strengthening the regulator, finalising the legal separation and changes in the service acquisition 
framework are recommended along with the swift full opening up to competition. Finally, successful 
introduction of competition in the rail sector would also be facilitated by a uniform, market-oriented 
approach to universal service across the network sectors in order to guarantee a level playing field and to 
avoid entry barriers to new competitors. Conclusion 24. 
Recent reforms of competition policy enforcement and the favourable stance of the government 
towards more competition constitute undeniable progress towards more competitive domestic markets. 
However, this may not suffice to bring productivity in certain sectors, such as retail distribution, 
telecommunication and energy, in line with that of the leading OECD countries. In order to reap the full 
benefits of liberalisation in terms of higher productivity and employment growth as well as competitive 
prices, further steps need to be taken. Overall, the system of regulation as a whole may need 
reconsideration in order to be aimed at a clearly defined, efficient role of each regulatory authority and at 
securing effective cooperation between the authorities. A number of additional policy measures which 
should be taken in order to assure that Belgian consumers benefit from competition on the market are 
summarised in Box 7 below. Box 7. Policy recommendations to enhance competition The Competition Authority needs further strengthening  The effective independence and the accountability of the Competition Authority should be monitored, in order to assess whether further strengthening in these areas is necessary. Resources may need to be 
reviewed and eventually increased to levels observed in other small economies with a proactive competition 
enforcement stance.  In order to avoid foregoing or postponing important cases and to allow the Competition Authority to adopt a more proactive role in analysing the market, its resources should be increased. The Competition Council 
should be established as the institution of appeal against all the decisions of the sectoral regulators.  In order to improve deterrence, the law should provide for criminal sanctions for hard-core cartel infringements. High fines should not be avoided as they deter anticompetitive practices and increase the 
attractiveness of applying for leniency. Confidentiality rules should be reviewed and possibly loosened with 
a goal of facilitating the cooperation of the Authority with network sector regulators. Competition-burdening regulation in retail distribution should be abolished  In order to benefit from the competitive nature of the retail sector, with the goal of creating employment, improving purchasing power and bringing productivity in line with other OECD countries, the competition 
inhibiting regulation should be scrapped (e.g. restrictions on sales below cost, opening hours and tied sales, 
black-out periods). Zoning laws for large outlets should be restricted to evaluating spatial effects (urban 
planning, access, safety) in order to assure they do not protect existing retailers against new competition. Sectoral regulation needs to focus on implicit barriers to new entry  To improve the effectiveness of regulatory action in the energy sectors, the complicated regulatory structure should be reconsidered. Reforming the setup to establish a single, independent nationwide regulator with 
competencies including the areas of distribution and supply of gas and electricity in order to deal with the 
local monopolies, should reduce the bureaucratic procedures and the burdens for new entrants. 
Alternatively the binding co-operation procedures between the regulatory bodies should be introduced in 
order to align the objectives of regional regulators, increase the efficiency of communication procedures. 
Independence of the regional regulators from the governments should be assured. ECO/WKP(2009)77 29  In order to facilitate new entry, ownership separation between different segments of the electricity and gas markets should be considered. For the same reason, regulatory efforts should be strengthen to ensure that 
the ban on cross-subsidisation between electricity and gas markets is enforced.  New entry should be promoted by improving the role of the wholesale exchange and reconsidering the universal service obligations (USOs) and their variation across regions. If sub-federal governments wish to 
implement additional social policies they should finance it from their own budget rather than through 
distribution tariffs.  In the electricity sector further efforts should be made to increase interconnection capacity, encourage new entry and continue auctioning off of the incumbent's production capacity.  An anonymous wholesale pool for gas should be developed in order to facilitate new entry. Assuring strong vertical separation, between the Zeebrugge gas hub and the LNG terminal on the one hand, and the 
dominant players in the energy market on the other is strongly advised in order to assure third party access. 
The effectiveness of recent measures to reduce long contract lengths in the gas wholesale market should 
be evaluated and if necessary new measures should be adopted. The telecommunication regulator needs to toughen its stance against incumbent's violations  The regulator should be given the ability to introduce periodic penalties and to block the introduction of offers if ex ante conditions are not fulfilled. Furthermore, the regulators independence may need explicit 
strengthening while the government should proceed with the privatization of the incumbent.  In fixed telephony the regulator should increase efforts to encourage local loop unbundling (LLU) through strengthening its stance on the incumbents violations in the areas of deadlines for LLU provision, service 
level agreements, collocation and the quality of services provided. Fines for the incumbent's violations 
should be used more widely and preferably be automatic. The regulator should strongly promote 
competition in new generation networks.  In order to avoid inefficient complication of the regulatory structure and the dilution of powers, any pressure from Community-level broadcasting regulators to gain power to regulate transmission infrastructure should 
be strongly opposed.  In mobile telephony the regulator should increase efforts to lower the mobile termination charges and to decrease the uncertainty surrounding its decisions through a better preparation to defend them in court.  The fourth network operator should be introduced as soon as possible. Maximum contract duration should be reduced in order to increase flexibility and facilitate entry. USOs should be funded from the government 
budget via competitive tendering. Faster opening up of the other network sectors is essential  Competition should be introduced in all segments of postal services. Efforts to decrease entry barriers should be increased: the scope of USOs should be reconsidered and the clause on additional fund for USO 
financing should be eliminated. Again USO's (each service individually) should be financed directly from the 
budget through competitive tenders.  Faster opening up of the rail transport sector should be accompanied with strengthening the independence and powers of the regulator.
