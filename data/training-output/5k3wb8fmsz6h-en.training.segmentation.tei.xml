			<body>Securing Power <lb/>during the Transition <lb/>Generation Investment and Operation Issues <lb/>in Electricity Markets with Low‐Carbon Policies <lb/>Manuel Baritaud <lb/>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY <lb/>The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974. <lb/>Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member <lb/>countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative <lb/>research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 28 member <lb/>countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among <lb/>its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. <lb/>The Agency&apos;s aims include the following objectives: <lb/>n Secure member countries&apos; access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, <lb/>through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. <lb/>n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection <lb/>in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute <lb/>to climate change. <lb/>n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of <lb/>energy data. <lb/>n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies <lb/>and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy <lb/>efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. <lb/>n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and <lb/>dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international <lb/>organisations and other stakeholders. <lb/>IEA member countries: <lb/>Australia <lb/>Austria <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Canada <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Finland <lb/>France <lb/>Germany <lb/>Greece <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Italy <lb/>Japan <lb/>Korea (Republic of) <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Norway <lb/>Poland <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Slovak Republic <lb/>Spain <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Turkey <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>United States <lb/>The European Commission <lb/>also participates in <lb/>the work of the IEA. <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 1 <lb/>Foreword <lb/>At the October 2011 Governing Board Meeting at Ministerial Level, IEA member countries <lb/>endorsed the IEA Electricity Security Action Plan (ESAP). The proposed electricity security work <lb/>program reflects the challenge of maintaining electricity security while also seeking to rapidly <lb/>reduce carbon dioxide emissions of the power systems. In particular, the large‐scale deployment <lb/>of renewables needed to meet low‐carbon goals is technically feasible. However, it will lead to <lb/>more volatile, real‐time power flows, which will create new challenges for maintaining electricity <lb/>security. <lb/>Well‐functioning electricity markets will be needed to stimulate the sufficient, timely investment <lb/>needed to achieve low carbon and electricity security goals at least cost. Governments have a <lb/>crucial role to play. Better integrated and more effective policies, regulation and support <lb/>programs will be needed to complement and reinforce incentives for market‐based flexibility to <lb/>help deliver cost‐effective electricity security and decarbonisation. <lb/>The Electricity Security Action Plan consists of five work streams: <lb/>1. Generation Operation and Investment. This work stream examines the operational and <lb/>investment challenges facing electricity generation in the context of decarbonisation. <lb/>2. Network Operation and Investment. This work stream examines the operational and <lb/>investment challenges affecting electricity transmission and distribution networks as they <lb/>respond to the new and more dynamic real‐time demands created by liberalisation and large‐ <lb/>scale deployment of variable renewable generation. <lb/>3. Market Integration. This work stream identifies and examines the key issues affecting <lb/>electricity market integration, including policy/legal, regulatory, system operation/security, <lb/>spot/financial market and upstream fuel market dimensions. It draws from the other work <lb/>streams as appropriate, and from regional market development experience in member <lb/>countries. <lb/>4. Demand Response. This work stream examines key issues and challenges associated with <lb/>increasing demand response, reflecting its considerable potential to improve electricity sector <lb/>efficiency, flexibility and reliability. <lb/>5. Emergency Preparedness. This work stream develops a framework for integrating electricity <lb/>security assessment into the IEA&apos;s key peer review programs – Emergency Response Reviews <lb/>and In‐depth Reviews – to improve knowledge and information sharing on electricity security <lb/>matters among IEA member countries, with a view to helping strengthen power system <lb/>security and emergency preparedness. <lb/> &quot; Securing Power during the Transition &quot; is an issue paper on generation operation and investment <lb/>in liberalised electricity markets with low carbon policies. After a brief overview of the <lb/>fundamentals of liberalised electricity markets, it presents the policy context of the transition to a <lb/>low‐carbon economy and reviews the current and foreseen operating challenges and the <lb/>investment issues. It considers ways to strengthen policy and regulatory arrangements to <lb/>encourage more flexible and responsive operation and more timely and efficient investment. It is <lb/>part of a series on electricity published in conjunction with the overall Electricity Security Action <lb/>Plan. <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 2 <lb/>Table of Contents <lb/>Foreword ....................................................................................................................................... 1 <lb/></body>

Only a few years ago there was confidence that <lb/>liberalised electricity markets in IEA member countries could also deliver sufficient and timely <lb/>generation investments needed to ensure security of supply. Most of the liberalised power <lb/>markets experienced significant investments in new efficient combined cycle gas power plants on <lb/>a merchant basis. Lessons Learned from Liberalized Electricity Markets (IEA, 2005) concluded that <lb/> &quot; electricity market liberalisation has delivered considerable economic benefits &quot; and that <lb/> &quot; minimising regulatory uncertainty is key to creating a framework for timely and adequate <lb/>investment &quot; . <lb/>However, policies to decarbonise electricity systems have served to magnify investment risk <lb/>and uncertainty at a time when the capital stock is ageing and slowing demand growth is <lb/>discouraging investment in many IEA power markets. Some new low‐carbon sources (mainly wind <lb/>and solar photovoltaics) have unique technical characteristics that accentuate real‐time power <lb/>system volatility, creating additional challenges for system operations. The combination of these <lb/>developments is increasingly perceived to pose a challenge to maintaining electricity security in <lb/>many IEA power systems. <lb/>Ensuring security of electricity supply is not just about avoiding blackouts at any cost; it is also <lb/>about the functioning of electricity markets. Clearly, a basic requirement of any effective market <lb/>and regulatory framework is to ensure a reliable and secure supply of electricity. An efficient <lb/>regulatory and market framework would also seek to deliver reliable electricity services that meet <lb/>end‐use requirements at least cost. Ultimately this can only be achieved over time if the market <lb/>stimulates adequate investment in new generation capacity at the right time, in the right place, <lb/>and using the most cost‐effective technologies. <lb/>In several OECD countries most incremental power production is driven by government policies <lb/>rather than markets – based on feed‐in tariffs or quota systems. New nuclear investment also <lb/>extensively relies on public policy support. This has led to a situation where some pioneers in <lb/>electricity market reform are beginning to express concern about the capacity of energy‐only <lb/>wholesale markets to provide sufficient incentives to deliver the investment needed to facilitate <lb/>decarbonisation while continuing to deliver reliable supply of electricity. <lb/> &quot; Securing Power during the Transition &quot; assesses the threats and identifies options for <lb/>competitive electricity markets embarking on the transition towards a low‐carbon generation. <lb/>The analysis provides an integrated analysis of issues, covering the impact of the global economic <lb/>and financial situation, energy policy context and the implications for electricity market design. Its <lb/>objective is to identify opportunities to improve regulatory and market designs to create a <lb/>framework for timely and adequate investments, in particular in conventional power plants. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 9 <lb/>Key findings <lb/>Energy markets have the potential to ensure electricity of supply provided that a number of <lb/>policy measures are pursued. These measures constitute a basic package that will bring benefits, <lb/>not only in terms of security of supply, but also in terms of overall efficiency during the transition <lb/>to a low carbon economy. They include: <lb/> providing more certainty concerning climate policies; <lb/> enhancing low carbon support instruments in order to ensure more effective integration of <lb/>variable renewable generation into electricity markets, in particular, the participation of <lb/>variable renewables to ensure system security; <lb/> incrementally improving wholesale energy market design in order to accommodate increasing <lb/>shares of variable renewables at least cost; and <lb/> enhancing technical standards and procedures, to more clearly define and enforce reliability <lb/>criteria, adequacy forecasts and controllability requirements of renewable generators. <lb/>Nonetheless, several reasons may explain why governments have introduced or are considering <lb/>the introduction of capacity mechanisms. First the degree of uncertainty concerning climate <lb/>policies and the pace of deployment of renewables may magnify risk to such an extent that <lb/>markets alone are unlikely to deliver efficient and timely investment responses. Second, <lb/>regulations that restrict efficient electricity price formation, such as unduly low prices caps, can <lb/>undermine market‐based signals for efficiently timed and located investment responses. Third, <lb/>the reduction in spot prices and lower and less predictable periods of operation resulting from <lb/>increasing volumes of variable renewable generation, increases cash flow uncertainty for <lb/>conventional generation, with the potential to encourage the closure of existing conventional <lb/>capacity and discourage timely investment in new capacity. Where these risks are material, there <lb/>may be a case for, capacity arrangements that can create a safety net in order to ensure sufficient <lb/>and timely investments. Possible capacity mechanisms include: <lb/> Targeted contracting of capacity, which can provide a temporary fix but may introduce <lb/>distortions between technologies. <lb/> Market‐wide capacity mechanisms can be effective to create a safety net if well‐designed but <lb/>tend to be costly and complex and can introduce other forms of market distortion, such as the <lb/>risk of over‐investment or under‐investment and market manipulation. <lb/>Capacity mechanisms would constitute a shift toward heavy‐handed regulatory intervention, in <lb/>which a central entity – not the market – has to plan how much generation capacity is needed. <lb/>Added to the policy‐driven deployment of renewables, such mechanisms have the potential to <lb/>jeopardise the competition benefits from electricity market liberalisation. <lb/>Competitive electricity markets must be supported by tough <lb/>regulation <lb/>Even if competitive electricity markets are still relatively recent, there is clear empirical evidence <lb/>that well‐designed competitive markets does work and can bring economic benefits. That has not <lb/>been an easy conclusion; given the unique features of electricity in terms of real time balancing needs <lb/>and lack of demand response to prices, market rules must be well designed to ensure reliable supply. <lb/>The experience of several IEA member countries over more than ten years demonstrates how it has <lb/>worked in practice. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 10 <lb/>Parallel to the process of developing competition, many OECD governments have adopted <lb/>policies in order to decarbonise electricity generation in the coming decades. To meet the <lb/>greenhouse gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming, governments are actively <lb/>pursuing low‐carbon policies. Defining high level principles for the electricity market is simple: set <lb/>a high carbon price, add some technology‐specific support and create a competitive market <lb/>platform to bring in new technologies and innovative solutions. This will create the foundation for <lb/>decarbonising the electricity sector at least cost and delivering adequate generation capacity to <lb/>maintain electricity security of supply. This being said, existing carbon pricing mechanisms such as <lb/>the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) seem sufficient to influence dispatching decisions <lb/>and investment choices between readily available technologies such as coal and gas, but do not <lb/>create sufficient incentive for the large‐scale commercial deployment of new low‐carbon <lb/>technologies. <lb/>Uncertainty about climate and renewables policies impacts future <lb/>investment needs <lb/>Policies have been introduced or are being considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But <lb/>defining appropriate policies during the transition is necessarily an incremental development <lb/>process. The global climate negotiations have proved to be challenging and most stakeholders do <lb/>not expect a new global agreement to enter into force before 2020 at the earliest. Regional <lb/>carbon markets introduced to date have resulted in prices that are to too low and too uncertain <lb/>to trigger low‐carbon investments. Given that any carbon market is driven by policy decisions and <lb/>is subject to uncertain economic and technological developments, carbon price volatility is to be <lb/>expected. Facing this situation, some countries have introduced a carbon price floor(s) (the United <lb/>Kingdom) while others are considering introducing sectoral measures restricted to electricity <lb/>generation (the United States) rather than economy‐wide carbon markets. <lb/>Renewables support schemes have proven effective at facilitating deployment. They pursue <lb/>multiple objectives, including promoting long‐term industrial policies, and economic stimulation. <lb/>They have delivered substantial and sometimes unanticipated levels of deployment of some <lb/>technologies. But most of these technologies are promising but not yet fully cost‐competitive and <lb/>renewable deployment has come with a cost. In many cases, they pose an increasing burden on <lb/>the price of electricity for domestic and, in certain countries, industrial consumers. The pace of <lb/>their deployment is dependent on the level of government subsidy and recent policy decisions <lb/>have served to raise the degree of uncertainty associated with the pace of their deployment. <lb/>The growing challenges of designing a stable regulatory <lb/>framework and well‐functioning markets <lb/>Stable and predictable climate and low‐carbon policies would have the potential to mitigate <lb/>some of the problems associated with investment incentives. Examples of such policies include <lb/>providing more certainty for carbon pricing, defining attainable policy goals, developing <lb/>predictable policies for renewables and energy efficiency, and avoiding sudden decisions that can <lb/>erode certainty and confidence among market participants. Governments should aim to provide <lb/>as much certainty and predictability as possible, recognizing that the uncertain economic <lb/>environment and technological developments will demand a degree of flexibility. <lb/>Delivering cost‐effective energy efficiency improvements is a critical component of electricity <lb/>security. If this potential is left untapped, greater investment will be needed in new generation. <lb/>Well‐functioning markets create incentives to deliver innovative and cost‐effective demand <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 11 <lb/>response and energy efficiency. Policies should seek to complement and build on these <lb/>incentives. However it is important that there is as much certainty as possible that energy <lb/>efficiency policies will deliver their targets, both to ensure that costs are minimised and so that <lb/>they do not introduce undue uncertainty in demand trends that would make investment in supply <lb/>more challenging. <lb/>Increasing shares of variable renewables exacerbate the issues with investments in peak power <lb/>plants. The variability of electricity demand and the need to meet peak demand has always been <lb/>a concern for system operators. During a few hours of peak demand, efficient electricity <lb/>wholesale hourly prices are volatile and much higher than the yearly average wholesale price: <lb/>efficient peak prices reflect the costs of the plants needed to meet peak demand. With high <lb/>shares of wind and solar power, new investment in capacity, including generation plants, demand <lb/>response, storage capacity will be needed. However, attracting sufficient and timely investment in <lb/>peak capacity and incentivizing demand response has proven to be a problem for several OECD <lb/>electricity markets. <lb/>Removing restrictions on wholesale peak prices during scarcity conditions is important to <lb/>ensure well‐functioning electricity markets. Wholesale peak prices during scarcity conditions are <lb/>not intrinsically bad, since in periods of scarcity, high prices act to incentivise demand response. <lb/>More sophisticated structural and behavioural remedies should be pursued to address concerns <lb/>about market power, rather than poorly targeted price controls. Ultimately a more flexible <lb/>demand side would contribute to mitigating market power and price volatility, and ought to be <lb/>pursued to enhance market efficiency and flexibility. <lb/>Increasing shares of variable renewables will decrease load factors of base‐load plants and mid‐ <lb/>merit plants, add to the variability of revenues and can lead to very low wholesale prices during <lb/>hours of high renewable generation with zero fuel cost. Variable renewable resources will <lb/>reduce conventional base‐load capacity needs over time. Yearly variability of weather conditions <lb/>may further increase the variability of revenues. Compounded with uncertain carbon prices, this <lb/>will further deter market‐based investment in low‐carbon base‐load technologies. Attracting <lb/>financing with more volatile and variable cash flows will become an increasing challenge, <lb/>exacerbated by the current financial context. <lb/>Variable renewables will need to provide flexibility services in <lb/>order to secure system operations <lb/>At significant penetration levels, generation using variable renewable energy magnifies the <lb/>volatility of real‐time electricity balancing, increasing the challenge to maintain reliable and <lb/>secure power system operations. Challenges include: <lb/> the low contribution of variable renewables to meet peak demand with a reasonably high <lb/>probability, <lb/> longer and steeper ramp‐rates of residual demand, and <lb/> the limited predictability of renewables and higher balancing needs during hours of high <lb/>renewable generation. <lb/>The flexibility of the electricity system can be increased by flexible conventional generation, <lb/>interconnections, storage and demand response. But variable renewables such as wind and solar <lb/>photo‐voltaic (PV) can and should have a role to play, which necessitate that their output be <lb/>controllable. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 12 <lb/>With high shares of variable renewable resources, these will also have to contribute to the <lb/>balancing of the system. The experience in many countries to date indicates that beyond a <lb/>certain level (20 to 30% of energy, depending on the features of the electricity systems), the <lb/>variable renewable output must be controlled during periods of exceptionally high output in order <lb/>to ensure secure and reliable system operations. This means that in practice, some wind turbines <lb/>or solar power plants must be curtailed, as is already the case in Spain, Texas and Ireland. <lb/>Investment in other flexibility options helps mitigate curtailment for security reasons. <lb/>Efficient participation of renewables in the markets requires both renewable support and <lb/>adaptation of the design of markets. Some renewable technologies including hydro, biogas and <lb/>concentrated solar power with heat storage are already capable of flexible operations and a <lb/>provision of system services. Other large‐scale variable renewable facilities could also participate <lb/>in the energy market by providing a dollar per MWh bid, below which they are no longer willing to <lb/>generate. This implies an adaptation of the design of renewable support instruments. <lb/>A market platform for flexible services can be based on existing balancing and reserve markets <lb/>and creates a level playing field for all technologies. Defining flexibility products such as ramping <lb/>up and down, fast response ramping, minimum load balancing, etc. can reveal a price for each <lb/>flexibility service. These services are being supplied by the same assets, and their availability <lb/>depends on short‐term arbitrages between different markets. All technologies should be able to <lb/>participate in these markets, including variable renewable and conventional generation, demand <lb/>response and storage. Participation of renewables in balancing markets would orient investment <lb/>within renewables towards a more flexible portfolio and provide longer‐term signals to invest in <lb/>capacity with the right capabilities. <lb/>Capacity arrangements can create a safety net to cope with <lb/>uncertainties <lb/>While in theory, well designed, energy‐only electricity markets could ensure adequate <lb/>investments, this is becoming increasingly challenging under policies that promote rapid and <lb/>large‐scale decarbonisation. Our analysis also indicates that current policy and regulatory risks <lb/>may act as a deterrent for the investments in generation needed to ensure security of supply. <lb/>Existing or foreseen restrictions on power peak prices, lack of credibility of carbon policy, the <lb/>uncertain pace of development of renewable and nuclear policies, as well as energy efficiency <lb/>policy targets, all induce a degree of policy risk. Private investors are not in the best position to <lb/>handle these kinds of risk. <lb/>Improved climate, energy and renewable policies and better energy markets are needed to <lb/>address these challenges. Following the economic crisis, many OECD countries are currently <lb/>experiencing a situation of excess capacity, and thus have a window of opportunity in which to <lb/>address these issues before considering other more interventionist arrangements. This should be <lb/>a priority as they will deliver economic benefits in terms of lower dispatching costs and better <lb/>price signals and have the potential to substantially reduce the transitional costs associated with <lb/>of decarbonisation. This includes improving renewable policies, removing restrictions on peak <lb/>prices, creating more transparent and efficient market platforms for flexibility services, <lb/>developing efficient locational pricing and integration of the day ahead, intra‐day, balancing and <lb/>reserve markets. Obviously, this is easier said than done and in particular improving climate policy <lb/>depends on a range of wider issues including progress with international negotiations and will <lb/>take time. If a situation of excessive uncertainty persists, there may be a material risk that <lb/>competitive electricity markets may not provide timely and sufficient investment to maintain <lb/>security of supply. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 13 <lb/>Capacity mechanisms, including targeted contracts and market wide capacity arrangements, are <lb/>a second‐best solution to ensure security of supply and generation adequacy. The objective of <lb/>such mechanisms should be not to increase the profitability of existing assets hit by the economic <lb/>crisis, but rather to provide certainty that there will be enough capacity available, either with <lb/>existing old plants or new assets if needed. <lb/>Targeted contracts can help countries facing short‐term and transitory adequacy or reliability <lb/>issues during the transition period. Such contracts are quick to implement and unwind once <lb/>policy and regulatory uncertainty has been reduced and market design improved. Therefore, <lb/>targeted contracts have the potential to promote security of supply without necessarily <lb/>jeopardizing the the economic benefits from well‐functioning energy‐only markets in the longer <lb/>run. However, expectations of such contracts can distort market prices and might lead to strategic <lb/>behavior as companies withhold investment and wait for their introduction. Moreover, <lb/>experience in certain countries indicates that it could be difficult to stop them. <lb/>Market‐wide capacity mechanisms can be effective to ensure generation adequacy but tend to <lb/>be complex, costly and subject to regulatory risk. By creating an explicit market for capacity, they <lb/>can be effective to ensure adequate capacity. They can be used to promote flexibility, investment <lb/>in capacity and in particular, demand response. They also have the potential to address the <lb/>growing discrepancy between the ongoing need for flexible conventional generation capacity and <lb/>its declining utilisation, which is a salient feature of systems with high variable renewable shares. <lb/>They have the potential to encourage competition between different technologies, while reducing <lb/>the risk of over‐investing in particular technologies associated with targeted contracts. <lb/>However, capacity markets tend to have high transaction costs and put a burden on regulatory <lb/>institutions. They might have unintended consequences in introducing secondary incentives and, <lb/>depending on their design, may create excess capacity and lower demand response during <lb/>scarcity conditions. In addition, while regional integration of electricity markets is an important <lb/>source of flexibility and efficiency gains, national capacity markets tend to reinforce national <lb/>rather than market‐wide assessments of generation adequacy, thereby introducing distortions <lb/>between different countries or jurisdictions. Before introducing capacity mechanisms, <lb/>governments should carefully consider the timing of their introduction, their impact on incentives <lb/>and define common rules for regional markets spanning multiple jurisdictions. <lb/>Searching for a target model of low‐carbon investments <lb/>This work mainly focuses on issues regarding timely and efficient investments in conventional power <lb/>plants during the transition towards a low‐carbon economy. During the transition, governments will <lb/>probably continue to incentivise most non‐hydro renewable and other low‐carbon investments. <lb/>Looking forward, a major challenge facing electricity markets will be to deliver investments in low‐ <lb/>carbon technologies, which should represent the bulk of new investment if decarbonisation of the <lb/>power sector is to be achieved in the medium‐term. What will the market wholesale power prices <lb/>be with high variable renewables? What share of low‐carbon electricity can be expected from <lb/>market‐based investments in electricity markets with a high price of carbon? Will this be enough to <lb/>achieve the decarbonisation objectives while maintaining security of electricity supply? Designing a <lb/>wholesale electricity market to reach the least‐cost dispatch and deliver the desired level of low‐ <lb/>carbon investment is a challenge that will require further research. If a revised market design is <lb/>needed in the next decade to help cost‐effectively and efficiently manage very high shares of low‐ <lb/>carbon generation, work on this model should begin now. The prospect of another change in market <lb/>settings could cause further investment uncertainty and lead to delayed investment, so the sooner <lb/>there is clarity around this long term direction the better. <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 14 <lb/>1. The general framework for efficient electricity <lb/>markets 1 <lb/>An effective electricity sector has to deliver low‐cost, secure and sustainable energy. In many <lb/>economies competitive forces are seen as the most efficient means to achieve this outcome. But <lb/> &quot; markets do not design themselves&apos;&apos; and in virtually all markets for goods and services, <lb/>governments use policies to correct for some level of market failure, and in this respect, power <lb/>markets are no exception. Effective policy in the electricity sector should allow consumers to <lb/>capture the bulk of the benefits that flow from competition, whilst also delivering solutions to <lb/>pressing environmental challenges. <lb/>This chapter seeks to introduce the role of competitive markets in electricity generation. First, <lb/>several unique features of electricity are identified that are relevant to the role of competition in <lb/>power markets. Second, two approaches of electricity provision are presented, one based on <lb/>monopoly provision and the other on competition. Some benefits and shortcomings of these two <lb/>approaches are outlined. Lastly, three areas are presented where regulators intervene to address <lb/>problems of market failure, while maintaining the benefits of competitive activity in the power <lb/>sector. These areas are supply reliability, reductions in carbon emissions and technology <lb/>spillovers. The section concludes with a brief discussion of the capacity of electricity markets to <lb/>deliver the long‐term decarbonisation objectives. <lb/>Electricity: a service with unique characteristics <lb/>Electricity has a number of characteristics that affect the way competitive forces are used in <lb/>electricity production and supply. Three are outlined below. <lb/>Real time supply <lb/>Since electricity cannot be stored cost‐effectively in bulk quantities, supply and demand must be <lb/>balanced in real time, using complex systems of dispatch among multiple providers. Supply and <lb/>demand imbalances in one location on an electrical supply network have the potential to upset <lb/>the balance across the entire interconnected network. As such, a system operator must ensure <lb/>that demand is balanced across the network at all times so as to maintain frequency for all <lb/>network users. A platform is used to allow all those providing electricity supplies to communicate <lb/>in real time with the system operator. In a competitive electricity market this central platform <lb/>must also be a market platform, to allow for the matching of demand and supply, so that the <lb/>cheapest energy bids can be identified and dispatched to meet demand. <lb/>Networks with monopoly characteristics <lb/>Electricity is distributed through a network of generators, loads and wires. In a given geographical <lb/>area it is economical to build only one network, and a single network is most cheaply provided by <lb/>a single supplier. When one supplier is best placed to provide a service, this is a service with <lb/>&apos;natural monopoly characteristics&apos;, meaning competition between multiple providers cannot <lb/>operate to reduce costs of supply. As a result, networks services are provided commercially by <lb/>single parties and the revenues from these services must be regulated, to ensure the provider <lb/>does not abuse their monopoly position. In economies with competitive markets for electricity <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 15 <lb/>supply, network activities are split from competitive activities in the generation and marketing of <lb/>electricity. <lb/>A lack of demand response <lb/>Consumers have traditionally had limited opportunities to respond to short term changes in the <lb/>cost of power supply, as their rates do not react to short term changes in overall demand. This <lb/>means that the retail price and end customer pays for electricity does not increase when the <lb/>wholesale price for electricity is highest, even though the cost of that electricity may change <lb/>substantially. The differences in the cost of supply are generally averaged and spread across all <lb/>users, so price signals do not communicate information about the scarcity of electricity at <lb/>particular times. As a result, customers are unable to ration supply in response to the value they <lb/>place on it and will continue to demand electricity even when its underlying cost is at peak levels. <lb/>Technological developments are addressing this lack of demand response, by measuring when <lb/>customers use their electricity and using this information to develop more cost‐reflective tariffs. <lb/>However, in the medium term the lack of demand response in electricity markets continues to <lb/>have important implications for policies designed to influence consumer behaviour. <lb/>Two approaches for providing electricity <lb/>Two approaches exist for providing electricity in modern economies. The first is an integrated <lb/>monopoly provider and the second is a competitive market. In practice, a multitude of variations <lb/>exist that integrate elements of both approaches. <lb/>In virtually all energy markets worldwide, provision via a monopoly was the primary model for <lb/>industrial organisation. Under this scheme, a single agency or company is tasked with managing <lb/>the entire energy supply chain for customers in a defined area. Typically, these utilities were <lb/>government owned and fully vertically integrated, meaning they owned all the assets required to <lb/>generate, distribute and retail electricity. <lb/>In a competitive market approach, competition is introduced to segments of electricity supply. <lb/>While approaches differ widely, competition is most frequently introduced in generation and <lb/>marketing (also known as retail). Competition in distribution is limited for the reasons outlined <lb/>above. <lb/>Vertically integrated regulated monopolies <lb/>Under a model of monopoly provision the vertically integrated utility enjoys an exclusive mandate <lb/>over the demand of customers in a given area, meaning it does not have to compete for <lb/>customers based on price or the quality of its service. As such, government agencies are tasked <lb/>with ensuring that the quality meets community expectations and prices are kept at acceptable <lb/>levels. <lb/>Where a single entity provides all electricity for customers in a defined area, governments and <lb/>regulators have a role in determining the appropriate level of investment in supply. If investment <lb/>is inadequate to meet demand then customers will experience electricity shortage and rationing <lb/>of electricity. Conversely, if investment is in excess of levels required to meet demand then the <lb/>cost of electricity must eventually rise significantly to fund investments in infrastructure that is <lb/>rarely used. When a regulator approves an investment under a monopoly model, the utility passes <lb/>on the cost of this investment to all its customers. Since no customer will willingly forego <lb/>electricity altogether, the regulators&apos; decision effectively ensures that end customers will fund any <lb/>investment that has been approved. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 16 <lb/>Publicly‐owned utilities are sometimes also tasked with meeting a broader range of public policy <lb/>goals than merely the efficient and effective provision of electricity. These could include keeping <lb/>the price of retail energy at lower levels that do not reflect cost (for example, through cross <lb/>subsidies), maintaining employment, or preferring a certain generating fuel. <lb/>Benefits <lb/>The benefits of monopoly provision are generally considered to be simplicity and certainty. A <lb/>single integrated utility does not require complex systems to dispatch multiple providers at the <lb/>wholesale level, or retail market platforms that allow for switching of customers between <lb/>different retail providers, or an elaborate access regime to ensure multiple parties can access <lb/>monopoly network infrastructure on equal terms. <lb/>A single provider can theoretically integrate all the information it has on customer usage into <lb/>nuanced view of developments in demand. Where fresh investment is required to meet demand, <lb/>a government can direct a utility to invest at a given time and this ensures that capacity will be <lb/>adequate to meet reliability standards. <lb/>Moreover, regulated monopolies have also been able to deliver investments in capital intensive <lb/>and innovative technologies. For instance, this rendered possible the large‐scale deployment of <lb/>nuclear fleets in France from the 1970s to 1980s, contributing to controlling costs and mitigating <lb/>risks. <lb/>Drawbacks <lb/>The drawbacks of the monopoly model are that the utility arguably has weak incentives to reduce <lb/>costs, to improve its service offerings, innovate in new services or invest in new generation <lb/>technologies. Once a regulator has approved a given level of investment, the utility is virtually <lb/>guaranteed to collect the approved revenues, regardless of how it performs. In practice, <lb/>regulators of monopoly providers frequently seek to introduce incentives similar to those <lb/>associated with competitive markets, to promote efficient outcomes that meet acceptable levels <lb/>of service. <lb/>A further drawback is that like any observer the regulator will face limitations in its understanding <lb/>of the dynamics of supply and demand. Even if the regulator makes forecasts based on the best <lb/>information at hand, these decisions will sometimes lead to conditions of under or over supply. In <lb/>these conditions the risk associated with these forecasting errors are carried entirely by the end <lb/>customer, who has no choice but to fund all approved investments. <lb/>In addition to limitations in knowledge, the regulator can also generally intervene reasonably <lb/>easily in key decisions of the utility, which makes it easier to pursue other public policy goals. <lb/>Regulators are also susceptible to influence or pressure from groups that stand to benefit or <lb/>suffer loses based on their decisions, even when theoretically regulators are independent. Also, <lb/>when regulating monopolies, regulators frequently know less about features of demand and <lb/>supply than the companies they regulate, which creates further opportunities for their decisions <lb/>to be influenced to benefit one section of society instead of consumers as a whole. <lb/>Lastly, in a market where one entity is directed to deliver a service, incentives for innovation are <lb/>generally considered to be weak, unless governments are particularly and effectively involved in <lb/>supporting complementary research and development activities. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 17 <lb/>Competitive model <lb/>Introducing competition in generation and marketing means allowing multiple parties to compete <lb/>to provide electricity to customers in a given area. A wholesale market platform, organised or <lb/>over the counter, is established whereby generators can offer their supply at a given price. The <lb/>cheapest power is procured first and this allows for a price to be set reflecting the conditions of <lb/>supply and demand at that time. The electricity market prices allow investors in supply to assess <lb/>the profitability of investing in infrastructure required to supply customers with power. Although <lb/>many may invest, none is guaranteed that it will be called upon to generate. <lb/>When a party decides to invest in generation infrastructure, it makes projections about future <lb/>demand similar to those of the regulator in the monopoly model. However, the investor is unable <lb/>to pass all the risk of inappropriate projections on to the customer in the same way. <lb/>In addition to parties that own infrastructure, there are other parties that enter the market <lb/>merely as marketers of electricity. This involves procuring electricity on wholesale markets, <lb/>bundling underlying electricity with network services, and billing end customers. (Some parties <lb/>both generate and market electricity.) Marketers seek to acquire more customers based on lower <lb/>prices and superior levels of service. <lb/>Because supply and demand must be constantly matched in real time and customers have for the <lb/>time being very little opportunity to ration their use when wholesale prices are high, prices on <lb/>wholesale markets can increase rapidly when supply is short. In response to this volatility in <lb/>prices, a complex array of financial instruments has developed in competitive markets to allow <lb/>marketers to reduce their exposure to volatile movements in wholesale prices. <lb/>Benefits <lb/>The benefits of a competitive market are generally considered to be that it addresses the <lb/>shortcomings of the monopoly model in terms of poor efficiency, lack of innovation and too high <lb/>prices. <lb/>Where providers must compete to provide generation and marketing services they carry the risk <lb/>that their investments will be ill‐conceived or that they will run their assets inefficiently. In this <lb/>instance, they have strong incentives to make investments that anticipate the future needs of <lb/>consumers, as well as to minimise costs, as this approach offers the best chance of a commercial <lb/>return. In this context, customer choice can help to reveal the least cost alternative, as well as to <lb/>deliver an evolution in products and services. <lb/>As a result of competition between multiple providers, customers generally see a more <lb/>responsive service as well as a less costly means of supply. It is important to note in these <lb/>circumstances that introducing competition does not automatically mean that prices for <lb/>electricity will fall, for a range of reasons. But we must consider the baseline for energy prices, <lb/>which may be increasing, for example because the cost of inputs (such as fuel) is increasing. In <lb/>this instance, prices for electricity are likely to grow regardless of the supply model adopted, and <lb/>may rise less under a competitive model than they would have under a regulated model. <lb/>Challenges <lb/>The challenges associated with designing competitive wholesale electricity markets are generally <lb/>associated with some type of &apos;market failure&apos;, or an instance where competitive markets fail to <lb/>provide efficiently for the supply of a good or service, or are unable to fully value the cost of <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 18 <lb/>goods and services. Market failures are frequently defined in terms of public goods 2 or negative <lb/>externalities 3 and natural monopolies. <lb/>Among the various types of market failure that exist in relation to competitive electricity markets, <lb/>some are long established, while others relate to more recent environmental challenges. In <lb/>addition to market failure arising in relation to electricity networks, which are assets with <lb/>monopoly characteristics, market failures associated with power generation include air pollution <lb/>and carbon emissions flowing from, and technological innovation where the market does not <lb/>adequately promote the development and diffusion of energy technologies such as renewable <lb/>energy. <lb/>Approaches to internalising the cost of pollution long predate concerns about anthropogenic <lb/>climate change. These approaches generally involve various forms of tax that look to introduce <lb/>the cost of environmental damage to the cost of goods and services (Pigou, 1952). Estimating the <lb/>cost of a negative externality and intervening in market frameworks can be done in a variety of <lb/>ways. <lb/>Reliability, carbon emissions and technology spillovers <lb/>Reliability <lb/>In the category of market failures which have long been common to competitive power markets <lb/>the question of reliability 4 is a pertinent example. The system frequency is common for all <lb/>network users over a synchronous area (50 Hertz or 60 Hertz) and actions taken by one user can <lb/>affect the frequency and therefore the quality of power supply for all the others. Because energy <lb/>cannot be stored massively at low cost, the generator used to provide supply in rare moments of <lb/>peak demand will only rarely operate. Customers value reliability differently depending on their <lb/>circumstances. But unlike with markets for traditional goods, there are limited means to charge <lb/>according to each customer&apos;s willingness to pay for reliability (or willingness to ration their use of <lb/>power at times of peak demand). Consequently, all parties benefit somewhat from a system with <lb/>adequate supply, but it is difficult to determine the value that the community as a whole puts on <lb/>uninterrupted electrical supply. <lb/>In principle, a price level should exist above which a limited outage becomes an acceptable <lb/>alternative to the average user. However, this price level is likely to vary as a function of many <lb/>variables, such as the duration and timing of interruption, whether customers are generally <lb/>prepared for interruptions, whether customers are notified in advance notice, and the type of <lb/>customer. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2 A &apos;pure public good&apos; can be defined as goods and services which once made available to one party are then available <lb/>to all parties. One example is the atmosphere, which is used by all but traditionally was maintained by none. Problems <lb/>arise in relation to public goods because it is difficult to exclude parties from the benefits of the good or service, and so <lb/>it can be difficult to apportion the costs of providing the good or service to all parties that benefit. <lb/>3 A &apos;negative externality&apos; arises when the actions of an individual negatively affect the utility of another individual, but <lb/>the full cost of this is not captured in the costs of the first individual. An example is a coal power station that emits CO 2 <lb/>in to the atmosphere, while the negative cost of this pollution on the atmosphere is not factored into the costs of the <lb/>power station. The problem of carbon emissions represents a classic problem of negative externality. <lb/>4 Reliability here refers to reliability of supply rather than network reliability. Network reliability typically also presents <lb/>challenges associated with public goods, since all parties using the network rely on network stability but have a strong <lb/>private incentive to minimise their contribution to maintaining it. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/></note>

			<body>Page | 19 <lb/>Box 1 • The cost of ensuring security of supply <lb/>A number of different indicators are used by governments or regulators to define an acceptable <lb/>level of reliability in energy markets (Table 1). These include measures that target a number of <lb/>hours in a year where demand will not be fully met, and a threshold volume of unserved energy <lb/>that should not be breached. These mechanisms all relate in some way to the cost of marginal <lb/>supply, and indirectly to the value that customers place on reliability. In this way, considerations <lb/>about the value of lost load are inherent in features of market design such as market price caps. <lb/>Table 1 • Examples of reliability thresholds in wholesale electricity markets 6 <lb/>Mechanism <lb/>Market <lb/>Implications for wholesale prices <lb/>Time-based <lb/>No more than 30 hours of <lb/>expected curtailment duration <lb/>over 10 years <lb/>France <lb/>Implies that a marginal generator with fixed costs of USD 60/kW needs <lb/>to earn USD 20 000/MWh for three hours on average in order to remain <lb/>profitable. <lb/>Time based <lb/>1 day in ten years when <lb/>capacity is insufficient <lb/>PJM <lb/>(Northeast USA) <lb/>Translate to approximately 15 to 20 percent planning reserve margins <lb/>above expected peak demand.

A number of wholesale power markets <lb/>have set price caps at high levels, and these markets have consistently delivered adequate (but not <lb/>excessive) spare capacity, in the absence of other market interventions. Examples include the <lb/>Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and the Texas electricity market (run by the Electric <lb/>Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT); for an outline of the Australian situation, see Box 2. <lb/>5 It is duration d* such as 60 000+d*×100=20 000 ×d* which yields d* = 3.015 hours. <lb/>6 For France, see Décret 2006‐1170 du 20 septembre 2006 relatif aux bilans prévisionnels pluriannuels d&apos;équilibre entre l&apos;offre <lb/>et la demande d&apos;électricité; for PJM, see FERC order 747 (www.ferc.gov/whats‐new/comm‐meet/2011/031711/E‐7.pdf) and <lb/>North American Electric Reliability Corporation Reliability First Corporation Standard BAL‐502‐RFC‐02; for New Zealand, Single <lb/>Electricity Market Committee Policy parameters 2012 Decision paper, SEM‐11‐073; for Australia: standard set by AEMC <lb/>Reliability Panel. <lb/>For a given construction cost, it is possible to calculate the associated reliability criteria in terms of <lb/>expected lost load duration, a metric that governments often use in order to set the reliability <lb/>criteria. To take a simplified numerical example, the annual cost of a peak power plant is <lb/>60 000 USD/MW/yr, with a variable cost of 100 USD/MWh. Building one MW of capacity to operate it <lb/>only one hour would cost 60 100 USD/MWh, which is higher than the value of lost load (20 000 in this <lb/>example). Therefore it is less costly not to serve this MWh and rely on load curtailment. For 2 hours, <lb/>the cost would be (60 000+2*100)/2 = 30100 USD/MWh, which is again too costly. With a value of <lb/>lost load equals to 20 000 USD/MWh, the optimal expected curtailment duration would be <lb/>c. 3 hours. 5 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 20 <lb/>While regulators can theoretically allow prices for wholesale energy to be bid up without limit, yet <lb/>in practice they rarely do so. This is because customers are poorly placed to respond dynamically <lb/>to changes in prices, so it is unclear whether extreme prices paid in peak periods genuinely reflect <lb/>the value customers place on reliability. A further complication is that when supply is tight and <lb/>ownership in peak generation is limited to small number of parties, these parties can enjoy <lb/>market power whereby they can increase the price beyond competitive levels. As a result, system <lb/>operators attempt to estimate the value of reliable supply to the community as a whole and <lb/>frequently intervene to reduce consumption when prices exceed that level. The implications of <lb/>such interventions are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. <lb/>Box 2 • Incentives for investment in spare capacity in Australia <lb/>The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is a wholesale market through which generators sell <lb/>electricity in eastern and southern Australia. The main customers are energy retailers, which bundle <lb/>electricity with regulated network services for sale to residential, commercial and industrial energy <lb/>users. <lb/>Electricity produced by large electricity generators in the NEM jurisdictions is sold through a central <lb/>dispatch process that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) manages. The Australian NEM is <lb/>an energy only design. This means that all capacity in the market is remunerated through market <lb/>clearing prices. No other payments are made in the spot market except those arising from specifically <lb/>designed reliability safety nets and specific purpose ancillary services. (Financial hedges also occur <lb/>outside the market between market participants.) <lb/>The dispatch price for a 5‐minute interval is the offer price of the highest (marginal) priced energy <lb/>source that must be dispatched to meet demand. A wholesale spot price is then determined for each <lb/>half hour (trading interval) from the average of the 5 minute dispatch prices.

Reducing carbon <lb/>emissions associated with power generation is a central challenge in the project to reduce overall <lb/>emissions from human activity. This is the case not only because stationary energy currently <lb/>accounts for 40% of global energy‐related CO 2 emissions, but also because reducing emissions <lb/>from sources such as the transport sector will involve further electrification – since many of the <lb/>most promising low‐carbon energy technologies are those that produce electricity (wind and solar <lb/>being two examples). <lb/>Different analysis sought to estimate the value for carbon that would deliver the required <lb/>reduction in emissions According to the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives scenarios (IEA, <lb/>2012a), &quot; marginal abatement costs represent the cost of the last tone of CO 2 eliminated via <lb/>abatement measures. They are often used as a reference for what carbon price is needed to <lb/>trigger this abatement &quot; . In the Two Degrees scenario provided by the IEA&apos;s ETP, the carbon price <lb/>should increase from 30‐50 USD/tCO 2 (in real 2010 USD) by 2020 to 80‐100 by 2030 and 130‐160 <lb/>by 2050. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 000 <lb/>20 000 <lb/>30 000 <lb/>40 000 <lb/>50 000 <lb/>Megawatts <lb/>Market capacity <lb/>Market peak demand <lb/>Market forecast demand <lb/>Figure 2 • Australian electricity market peak demand and generation capacity, 1998/99‐2010/11 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 22 <lb/>Table 2 • Global marginal abatement costs and example marginal abatement options in the 2‐degree <lb/>scenario <lb/>2020 <lb/>2030 <lb/>2040 <lb/>2050 <lb/>Marginal cost <lb/>(USD/tCO 2 ) <lb/>30-50 <lb/>80-100 <lb/>110-130 <lb/>130-160 <lb/>Energy <lb/>conversion <lb/>Onshore wind <lb/>Rooftop PV <lb/>Coal with CCS <lb/>Utility scale PV <lb/>Offshore wind <lb/>Solar CSP <lb/>Natural gas w CCS <lb/>Enhanced geothermal <lb/>systems <lb/>Same as for 2030, but <lb/>scaled up deployment <lb/>in broader markets <lb/>Biomass with CCS <lb/>Ocean energy <lb/>Industry <lb/>Application of BAT in all <lb/>sectors <lb/>Top-gas recycling blast <lb/>furnace <lb/>Improve catalytic process <lb/>performance <lb/>CCS in ammonia and HVC <lb/>Bio-based chemicals and <lb/>plastics <lb/>Black liquor gasification <lb/>Novel membrane <lb/>separation <lb/>technologies <lb/>Inert anodes and <lb/>carbothermic <lb/>reduction <lb/>CCS in cement <lb/>Hydrogen smelting <lb/>and molten oxide <lb/>electrolysis in iron <lb/>and steel <lb/>New cement types <lb/>CCS in aluminium <lb/>Transport <lb/>Diesel ICE <lb/>HEV <lb/>PHEV <lb/>HEV <lb/>PHEV <lb/>BEV <lb/>Advanced biofuels <lb/>Same as for 2030, but <lb/>wider deployment and <lb/>to all modes <lb/>FCEV <lb/>New aircraft concepts <lb/>Buildings <lb/>Solar thermal space and <lb/>water heating <lb/>Improved building shells <lb/>Stability of organic LED <lb/>System integration and <lb/>optimisation with <lb/>geothermal heat-pumps <lb/>Solar thermal space <lb/>cooling <lb/>Novel buildings <lb/>materials; <lb/>development of <lb/>&quot;smart buildings&quot; <lb/>Fuel cells co-<lb/>generation <lb/>Source: IEA, Energy Technology Perspectives, 2012. <lb/>In the case of carbon emissions, a further complication arises, in that no low cost alternative or <lb/>set of alternatives currently exist to replace fossil fuels entirely. As a result, markets (and market <lb/>interventions such as permit systems) must deliver technological solutions as well as allowing for <lb/>the least cost adoption of these. Furthermore, this means that mandating a dramatic reduction of <lb/>emissions in the short term can imply very high (and in some cases not well‐known) costs. <lb/>Estimating the cost of a negative externality and intervening in market frameworks to correct for <lb/>market failure can be done in a variety of ways. <lb/>Trading systems in carbon permits have been established in number of economies in the world, <lb/>notably in the European Union, and recently in Australia. Permit trading systems are designed to <lb/>bring the cost of carbon emissions into the cost of producing goods and services, and thereby to <lb/>improve efficiency in the economy by reducing investment in more carbon intensive activities. <lb/>Trading systems are likely to be most efficient when there is significant variation in costs of <lb/>reducing pollution among different parties and sectors, so that trading of surplus permits can take <lb/>place and the least cost solutions can be adopted. <lb/>A wide variety of analyses have been carried out to assess the costs of limiting carbon emissions <lb/>through permit systems. The European Emissions Trading System demonstrates some of the <lb/>complexity involved in estimating the correct number of permits that should be made available in <lb/>order to create sufficient scarcity such that permit prices will be high enough. <lb/>Promoting the inception of low‐carbon technologies <lb/>Since the Industrial Revolution competitive markets have played a crucial role in delivering <lb/>technological outcomes, comparable to that of the contribution from pure scientific research. <lb/>Where a technological solution to a pressing environmental concern is not yet available, or is <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 23 <lb/>available only at high cost, governments look to intervene in markets to promote this outcome. <lb/>The objective is not only to incentivise economic actors to address the problem to the extent <lb/>possible, given existing technologies, but also to promote further technological development. <lb/>Economic theory suggests that significant cost reductions can accrue when commercial parties <lb/>apply technologies that are still in their inception phase. These effects are sometimes referred to <lb/>as &quot; learning by doing &quot; , and &quot; spillover &quot; effects. 7 Considerable evidence suggests that such benefits <lb/>genuinely occur (IEA, 2003). The extent of this externality relates primarily to the appropriate <lb/>level of public subsidy that should be directed towards a technology, since public funds are <lb/>justified to the extent that society as a whole will benefit. <lb/>In the case of climate change, mechanisms used to promote technological development in the <lb/>market include subsidies and quotas for renewable energy – both mechanisms that direct <lb/>expenditure towards emerging technologies. The objective of these programmes is not simply to <lb/>foster the adoption of the technologies in question, but also to promote development that will <lb/>lower their cost, as others copy the technological advances achieved. An example can be drawn <lb/>from the cost of solar PV systems in Germany, which has fallen considerably. In response, <lb/>subsidies for solar PV in Germany have been consistently reduced (Figure 3). <lb/>Figure 3 • Solar PV system cost and feed‐in tariff, medium‐scale systems (up to 100 kW), Germany <lb/>2006‐12 <lb/>EUR/MWh                                                                  EUR/kW <lb/>Setting subsidies to support technological development presents challenges, particularly in <lb/>estimating the appropriate value for a given technology in a given context. If subsidies are too <lb/>generous, investment will exceed optimal levels. Eventually, the benefits from subsidising the <lb/>production of a particular technology will present declining returns to scale, as the technology <lb/>matures and production is adopted more broadly. <lb/>Can electricity markets deliver the carbon emission targets by 2050? <lb/>If the levels of reductions in emissions targeted in a number of IEA member countries are to be <lb/>realised this implies significant growth in low‐carbon energy generation such as CCS, renewable <lb/>energy and nuclear. Electricity markets have been introduced in systems with large consolidated <lb/>sources of energy such as gas, coal and nuclear, with relatively high marginal costs and few <lb/>7 Spillovers can be considered a market failure driven by a positive externality: the party that carries out the initial <lb/>research does not capture the benefits of technological diffusion, yet society as a whole stands to benefit if spillovers <lb/>occur.

As a result, the ambitious targets by 2050 for low‐carbon energy in general, <lb/>and renewable energy on a large scale, have considerable implications for competitive energy <lb/>markets. <lb/>When variable renewable energy make‐up less than five percent of output, it is treated within <lb/>existing market frameworks. When penetration of renewable resources moves to between 20 and <lb/>40% of output, these electricity market frameworks need to be modified to allow a greater <lb/>coherence in the operation of conventional and renewable energy sources. The optimal mix of <lb/>conventional generation to support increased variable renewable generation and ensure security <lb/>of electricity supply will be different from the most economic mix prior to the introduction of <lb/>large amounts of variable energy resources. <lb/>In the long term, market design should not only ensure adequate investment but it should also <lb/>incentivise investments in low‐carbon generation. As renewable energy targets are set higher – <lb/>and even as direct economic support for these sources is reduced – many questions arise <lb/>concerning the functioning of electricity markets: what would be the level of low‐carbon, <lb/>including renewable generation, nuclear and CCS, with an electricity market with a high carbon <lb/>price? Would this be enough to deliver the almost complete decarbonisation of the electricity <lb/>sector by 2050? If not, how to design electricity markets? <lb/>Further work is required to fully understand how to design wholesale electricity markets and <lb/>carbon dioxide regulations capable to deliver the policy targets in terms of carbon dioxide <lb/>emission reduction. <lb/>The following chapters examine the suite of methods and approaches available to policy makers <lb/>to intervene in competitive power markets during the next 10 to 20 years of the transition to a <lb/>low‐carbon electricity sector, where the penetration of variable renewables moves to, say, above <lb/>20 to 40% of output. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 25 <lb/>2. Policy context: transition towards a low‐carbon <lb/>electricity generation <lb/>If governments want to achieve the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 2°C, they will have <lb/>to introduce policies that will have the effect to reduce power demand, increase energy <lb/>efficiency, promote investments in renewable technologies, nuclear and carbon capture and <lb/>storage. Compared to the World Energy Outlook&apos;s (IEA, 2011c) New Policies Scenario, which is a <lb/>central case, reaching the 2‐degree scenario would require reducing energy‐related carbon <lb/>emissions by 15 GtCO 2 per annum in 2035, out of which, two‐thirds would be from electricity, or <lb/>10 GtCO 2 /year. Out of this total, lower electricity demand would contribute to a reduction of 3 Gt, <lb/>renewable energy, 3 Gt, and nuclear and CCS about 2 Gt each (Figure 4). <lb/>To make this happen, OECD countries will have to lead the way and their relative contribution to <lb/>the decarbonisation effort will need to be even greater. The 2‐degree objective will require <lb/>decarbonising the power sector almost entirely by 2050. Obviously, the current short‐term <lb/>macroeconomic issues do not help and long‐term climate policies tend to shift away from <lb/>governments&apos; agendas. This uncertain commitment to climate policies is a major deterrent to <lb/>investment. <lb/>What instruments are used to deliver low‐carbon electricity and what is their influence on the <lb/>functioning of electricity markets? <lb/>The previous chapter described the high level objectives of what we can call the &quot; target electricity <lb/>market arrangement &quot; , where a proper carbon price is the cornerstone of climate policy. <lb/>Notwithstanding, current climate policies are from many aspects a trial and error process and in <lb/>practice, governments use a broad range of policies to complement a carbon price (IEA, 2011b). <lb/>This section reviews the existing or foreseen regulatory instruments which contribute to <lb/>promoting low‐carbon electricity and discusses their merits and impacts from the perspective of <lb/>electricity markets and investment decisions. <lb/>Figure 4 • Reduction in world energy‐related CO2 emissions in the 450 Scenario compared with the New <lb/>Policies Scenario and scope of different regulatory instruments (Gt CO 2 ) <lb/>Source: IEA (2011c). <lb/>CCS (‐2Gt) <lb/>Nuclear (‐2Gt) <lb/>Renewables (‐3Gt) <lb/>Energy efficiency <lb/>(‐3Gt) <lb/>Other sectors <lb/>(‐5Gt) <lb/>Economy‐wide <lb/>carbon price <lb/>Power sector <lb/>emissions targets <lb/>Electricity carbon <lb/>intensity targets <lb/>Technology‐specific <lb/>targets <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 26 <lb/>Level playing fields for low‐carbon generation investments <lb/>The price assigned to CO 2 will play an important role in directing investments away from <lb/>traditional fossil‐fuelled plants. In this perspective, the long‐term credibility of governments to <lb/>have a high carbon price will be important. But both the last summit dedicated to global climate <lb/>negotiations and recent carbon market experiences suggest that this is far from being the case. <lb/>Other electricity‐specific policy instruments have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. <lb/>Global climate policy will remain uncertain <lb/>International climate negotiations are a key element in the long‐term credibility of regional <lb/>climate policy initiatives: ambitious but isolated regional policy initiatives may not be sustainable. <lb/>Virtuous regions may well be constrained sooner or later to reduce their ambitions, due to <lb/>concerns that carbon leakage could distort their competitiveness and reduce their economic <lb/>growth. Even if current governments are committed to these policies, such anticipation by the <lb/>business community may be sufficient to undermine the investments incentives. <lb/>From this perspective, the current outcomes of the United Nation Framework Convention on <lb/>Climate Change, and in particular, the Conference of Parties in Durban in December 2011, do not <lb/>bring much immediate clarification for investors. Since the beginning of climate discussions, global <lb/>energy‐related carbon emissions have increased by 50% and electricity sector emissions have <lb/>increased by 65%. The Durban Conference decided to work toward a new global agreement by <lb/>2015, which will come into force in 2020. Meanwhile, IEA analysis suggests that if investment <lb/>patterns do not shift toward low‐carbon by 2017, the lock‐in of high emissions plants will mean <lb/>that the 2°C target will be much costlier and more difficult to achieve. In the short term, the <lb/>absence of a global agreement on climate inevitably weakens the ability of governments to <lb/>implement the carbon price high enough and above all, credible enough in the long run to trigger <lb/>low‐carbon investments. <lb/>Figure 5 • Timeline of global climate negotiations and evolution of carbon emissions, 1992‐2020 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 000 <lb/>20 000 <lb/>30 000 <lb/>1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 <lb/>2005 Kyoto <lb/>takes effect <lb/>2020 <lb/>New <lb/>objective <lb/>takes effect <lb/>2015 <lb/>New <lb/>objective <lb/>to be set** <lb/>1992 <lb/>Rio <lb/>1997 <lb/>Kyoto <lb/>2035 target, WEO <lb/>450 ppm scenario <lb/>Energy related <lb/>CO 2 Emissions* <lb/>(Mt) <lb/>*Sectoralapproach <lb/>** The goal is to have a global agreement for all UNFCCC parties <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 27 <lb/>Regional carbon markets are failing to trigger low‐carbon investments <lb/>Several countries or regions have introduced carbon markets in order to control carbon dioxide <lb/>emissions, including the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), New Zealand, Australia, <lb/>California, ten northeastern states of the United States (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, <lb/>RGGI), and Alberta, Canada. Other countries are considering or developing such markets: Mexico, <lb/>Brazil, Chile, South Korea and China. <lb/>The EU European Trading Scheme, the largest one, started operating in 2005 and was established <lb/>with the EU Climate Package of 2008 as a permanent mechanism for Europe. While the European <lb/>carbon price played a role in the coal‐to‐gas shift in power plant dispatch decisions, until recently, <lb/>its role in promoting for low‐carbon investment was showing mixed results. Specifically, <lb/> &quot; …uncertainty about future carbon price may complicate decision‐making particularly for <lb/>financing projects &quot; (Neuhoff, 2011). The current prices are too low to have any influence on <lb/>investment decisions. The economic crisis, the changing economic structure and the development <lb/>of renewable energy all contribute to this situation. Options are under discussion to increase <lb/>carbon prices, such as setting aside emissions allowances and possibly modifying the 2020 <lb/>emission target. However, there is a trade‐off between increasing the price through market <lb/>interventions and doing this in a way that maintains the long‐term credibility of the trading <lb/>scheme. Indeed, the long‐term credibility of the carbon price after the current phase ending in <lb/>2020 will be crucial for long‐lived, low‐carbon equipment such as nuclear power plants, CCS or off <lb/>shore wind‐farms. <lb/>Figure 6 • European carbon prices (EU allowances), 2005‐2012 <lb/>Source: Bloomberg and IEA data. <lb/>To supplement the EU emissions trading system, the United Kingdom unilaterally decided in 2011 <lb/>to introduce a carbon price floor (HM Treasury, 2010). The floor price will start in 2013 at GBP 16 <lb/>per tonne and will reach GBP 30 per tonne in 2020. But it is argued that even such a floor may not <lb/>provide enough certainty to investors; as it takes the legal form of a tax, it will have to be voted <lb/>each year by the parliament. Interestingly, the UK government itself is at the same time in the <lb/>process of introducing long‐term power purchase contracts (the so‐called contract for difference, <lb/>or CfD), to provide more certainty for investors. <lb/>€/tCO 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 28 <lb/>Australia has introduced a carbon pricing mechanism. There is a two‐stage approach for the <lb/>carbon price in Australia. <lb/> A fixed price period: The price starts at AUD 23 per tonne on 1 July 2012 and will rise at 2.5% <lb/>each year in real terms. <lb/> Emissions trading scheme: On 1 July 2015, the carbon price will transition to a fully flexible <lb/>price under and emissions trading scheme, with the price determined by the market. In a <lb/>recent decision, this system will be linked with the European ETS after 2018. 8 <lb/>Power sector emissions or carbon intensity targets <lb/>Faced with the political difficulty of introducing economy‐wide carbon prices, policy makers may <lb/>consider mechanisms at the sectoral level, which could still exploit a large portion of the emission <lb/>reduction potential in OECD countries. These approaches are second‐best approaches as they <lb/>may be more complex, and can introduce a bias in the emission reduction costs across sectors of <lb/>the economy. However, unlike a carbon pricing arrangement, they can avoid − at least initially − <lb/>large increases in energy prices and windfall profits, which are a hurdle for emissions pricing <lb/>policies. <lb/>For the power sector, a first possibility would be to limit the scope of emissions trading to this <lb/>sector, setting power sector emission targets in MtCO 2 , encompassing generation and power <lb/>demand in order to preserve the incentives to reduce electricity demand and seek gains in energy <lb/>efficiency. An argument for adopting such a measure is to reduce to some extent the carbon price <lb/>uncertainty associated with industrial demand. <lb/>But a second possibility proposed recently in the United States consists of restricting the scope of <lb/>the carbon constraint to the generation side even further, by setting a standard for the emissions <lb/>intensity of the generation mix. The arguments for adopting such measure are that this creates a <lb/>level playing field for all low‐carbon generation technologies (renewables, nuclear, CCS), leaving <lb/>to the market the responsibility to select the most promising technologies and handle changes in <lb/>future costs of different generation technologies and fuels. Thereby, it creates more certainty <lb/>while avoiding picking technology &quot; winners &quot; . Furthermore, such a standard for emissions can <lb/>avoid a large increase in electricity prices in the early stage of its introduction, which would <lb/>otherwise be necessary to trigger low carbon investments. The associated argument against this <lb/>approach is that, it may be less effective at reducing electricity demand than a carbon price. <lb/>Although it is not clear whether this proposal would create a more stable investment framework <lb/>and will be applied in the United States (see Box 3), electricity sector mechanisms may be an <lb/>interesting instrument. They can address the price uncertainty associated with industrial demand <lb/>of quotas in an economy‐wide cap and trade mechanism. They can also address the bias <lb/>introduced by technology‐specific policies, an issue that is discussed in the next section. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 29 <lb/>Box 3 • Proposal for a United States Clean Energy Standard Act <lb/>Source: EIA (2012). <lb/>Policies to supplement a carbon price are technology specific <lb/>In parallel with climate policies such as carbon prices, policy makers introduced low‐carbon <lb/>generation support measures, combining efforts in research, development and demonstration, as <lb/>well as technology learning resulting from marketplace deployment. Some low‐carbon energy <lb/>technologies are already competitive or close to becoming commercial and should be the first to <lb/>be deployed on a massive scale. This is the case of nuclear energy, on shore wind and solar PV in <lb/>certain regions. Many off‐shore wind farms have already been built and some governments are <lb/>actively pursuing the large‐scale deployment of this technology. Other low‐carbon technologies <lb/>such as CCS, which has a huge potential, are less mature and require a longer‐term vision. <lb/>The initial argument for adopting marketplace deployment measures is that low‐carbon <lb/>technologies will be needed to deliver timely CO 2 emissions cuts. Even where carbon pricing has <lb/>been introduced, these technology policies have been kept or even accelerated. Indeed, in <lb/>addition to their environmental benefits, deployment policies may be justified to reduce <lb/>dependence on imported fuels, create local &quot; green jobs &quot; to stimulate economic growth and <lb/>pursue industrial policy objectives to favour the emergence of global industrial leaders able to <lb/>export the technology and create competitive jobs in the long run. <lb/>Many low‐carbon generation technologies are generally not yet cost‐competitive with gas and <lb/>coal power plants, given the current level of fossil fuel and emissions prices. Furthermore, there is <lb/>a wide range of costs of different technologies, so policies to create a level playing field between <lb/>all low‐carbon technologies would lead to investments in the least costly ones, depending on <lb/>resources, probably large hydro, onshore wind and nuclear. With the goal of advancing a range of <lb/>technologies, governments have therefore introduced technology specific measures to deliver <lb/>investments in a portfolio of technologies and not only the most mature technologies at a given <lb/>point in time. <lb/>Following the failure in 2010 to pass a comprehensive cap and trade bill to reduce carbon, the <lb/>Obama Administration proposed a Clean Energy Standard. Under this approach, electricity <lb/>generators would be required to meet a rising fraction of their generation using zero carbon sources <lb/>or sources with lower carbon intensity (RFF, 2012). <lb/> &quot; A Clean Energy Standard is a policy that requires covered electricity retailers to supply a specified <lb/>share of their electricity sales from qualifying energy resources. The impact of a CES can vary <lb/>substantially based on the specifications of policy details. The specifications of the bill, Clean Energy <lb/>Standard Act of 2012 are the following (EIA, 2012): <lb/> All generation from existing and new wind, geothermal, biomass, municipal solid waste, and <lb/>landfill gas plants earns full credits; Hydroelectric and nuclear generation from capacity and <lb/>uprates placed in service after 1991 earn full credits; <lb/> Generation from nuclear and hydroelectric capacity placed in service prior to 1992 does not <lb/>receive any credit, but the total generation from these two sources is deducted from the overall <lb/>requirement for credits and deducted from the sales baseline of those owning them and <lb/>purchasing power; and <lb/> Partial credits are earned for generation using specific technologies fueled by natural gas or coal <lb/>based on a calculated crediting factor that reflects the carbon intensity of each technology. (…) <lb/>The Bill Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 target for the share of retail electricity sales from clean <lb/>energy sources starts at 24% in 2015 and ultimately reached 84% in 2035. (…) It is assumed that the <lb/>target remains constant after 2035 and that the policy does not expire. &quot; <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 30 <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 <lb/>GW <lb/>RoW <lb/>India <lb/>Spain <lb/>Germany <lb/>US <lb/>China <lb/>Wind <lb/>The design of specific instruments to support these technologies must tackle the fact that the <lb/>initial upfront investment cost typically represents 80% or more of the cost of production.

In Europe, these <lb/>developments have been driven by the 2020 renewable targets. In the United States, tax <lb/>incentives and renewable portfolio standards played a role. <lb/>Figure 8 • Installed capacity of solar PV and onshore wind worldwide, GW (1992-2020) <lb/>Renewable energy deployment has been extensively analysed (IEA, 2011a and 2012b), including <lb/>the renewable support mechanisms best suited to attract the capital needed to finance <lb/>renewables. With regard to the comparison of different support mechanisms, it appears that <lb/>feed-in tariffs, where governments pay a guaranteed price and renewables benefit from priority <lb/>dispatch, have been the most effective tool (IEA, 2011a). In some cases, a tendering process can <lb/>be used to define feed-in tariffs for specific projects. While remaining higher than on-shore wind <lb/>and conventional power generation technologies, solar PV costs have decreased dramatically in <lb/>the last few years. In combination with effective renewable support policies, this has recently <lb/>bolstered renewables in a way that had not been anticipated. However, for a number of reasons, <lb/>including the financing of renewable support policies, RE deployment shows signs of slowing <lb/>down, in particular in countries facing hard economic times.

In Spain <lb/>the renewable support costs amount to EUR 7 billion per year above the market price, c. 0.7% of <lb/>the gross domestic product, while the country is struggling to reduce its budget deficit. <lb/>In some OECD countries, deployment of renewables now shows signs of slowing down. In certain <lb/>countries, in 2009‐2011, some governments failed to adjust feed‐in tariffs according to cost <lb/>decreases, which triggered rapid and very high solar PV installation. This solar bubble has been <lb/>very profitable for project developers but very costly for electricity consumers. Adjustments had <lb/>to be made and governments cut too generous feed‐in tariffs for solar PV. These adjustments also <lb/>reflect that renewables targets in percentage of generation will be more easily achieved as <lb/>demand stalls, due to the economic crisis in certain countries. <lb/>Another reason explaining a growing uncertainty over renewable deployment is that solar <lb/>equipment manufacturers have experienced significant competition from emerging countries, <lb/>most notably China. The solar industry in Europe and the United States was severely hit in 2010 <lb/>and 2011 by China&apos;s leading position on the solar PV industry, somewhat weakening the economic <lb/>case for expensive feed‐in tariffs in OECD countries. <lb/>This is very important for the deployment of renewables until 2020, as they will, in general, <lb/>continue to be subsidized or mandated. Hopefully, some renewable technologies might reach <lb/>competitiveness with conventional technologies soon, which will allow them to escape from the <lb/>threat of political backlash. This future of renewables may now dramatically depend on the <lb/>capacity of technologies to deliver the promised learning rates. <lb/>Nuclear <lb/>Nuclear power produces bulk low‐carbon electricity, and unlike most of renewable energy <lb/>technologies, it is dispatchable and it is already competitive, provided that the cost of capital used <lb/>to finance the technology is not too high. However, nuclear energy experienced significant cost <lb/>overruns and delays in IEA countries, and the capacity of the nuclear industry to build on time and <lb/>on cost is a key element to keeping the cost of financing low and ensuring competitiveness. <lb/>Besides costs, nuclear energy is also exposed to market price risks under the current liberalised <lb/>market arrangement where electricity prices are set according to gas or coal prices. Based upon <lb/>the experience in recent nuclear project developments, it is possible to say that no new merchant <lb/>nuclear plants have been decided in liberalised markets recently. Nuclear power plants currently <lb/>under construction do not face long‐run market price risks and benefit either from long‐term <lb/>power purchase agreements or their inclusion in the regulatory asset base. <lb/>The accident of Fukushima did not obliterate the nuclear industry, although some countries <lb/>decided to phase out nuclear power, most notably Germany and Switzerland. Japan will also have <lb/>to decide of the role of nuclear energy in the coming years, given that the seismic/tsunami risk <lb/>faced by the archipelago had not been sufficiently addressed at Fukushima. On the contrary, <lb/>other large nuclear countries (China, Russia, Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom) <lb/>have reaffirmed their support to nuclear energy and are actively continuing to create the proper <lb/>regulatory frameworks to build new nuclear plants. With regard to nuclear waste, several OECD <lb/>countries still need to find long‐term storage solutions, and this legacy will continue to require <lb/>much effort in the coming years, whether nuclear countries build new reactors or not. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 32 <lb/>From the perspective of security of supply, nuclear contributes to diversifying the electricity <lb/>generation mix, and while uranium is generally imported, the production is widely distributed <lb/>around the world and notably in OECD countries (Australia and Canada). In addition, large <lb/>quantities of uranium can be easily stored and the stockpiles accumulated for military purposes <lb/>represent several years of consumption, de facto eliminating any risk of fuel supply disruption. <lb/>The main risks for security of supply could be a backlash from the population or a political risk of <lb/>forced closure, which could lead to shutting down reactors rapidly. Another risk might come from <lb/>finding of some type of fault on a series of reactors such as the cracks on reactor pressure vessels <lb/>recently found in Belgium. <lb/>For countries where new nuclear capacity will be high, it may also be necessary to define <lb/>strategies to mitigate the risk that delays of nuclear could cause for generation adequacy. In <lb/>practice, this would require maintaining mothballed power plants or delaying the retirement of <lb/>older units. <lb/>Table 3 • Status of nuclear projects in OECD countries and type of regulatory intervention <lb/>Country <lb/>Nuclear projects in OECD countries <lb/>(as of 2012) <lb/>Regulatory intervention <lb/>United States <lb/>Continued support to nuclear Two reactors <lb/>under construction at the Vogtle plant <lb/>Regulatory approval of investments <lb/>Federal loan guarantee (Energy Policy Act of 2005) <lb/>United <lb/>Kingdom <lb/>Active plan to build 4 to 8 GW of new nuclear <lb/>Long-term contracts with a contract for difference, with <lb/>a counterparty backed by government <lb/>Finland <lb/>One reactor under construction and two in <lb/>project <lb/>Long-term contracts with industry and electricity <lb/>suppliers <lb/>France <lb/>One reactor under construction <lb/>Reactor financed by EDF on its balance sheet as part <lb/>of its long-term nuclear strategy <lb/>Eastern <lb/>Europe <lb/>Several projects under consideration <lb/>No regulatory intervention but financing issues tend to <lb/>delay progress of these projects <lb/>Energy efficiency policies <lb/>Energy efficiency is one of the pillars of climate policies. According to the 2011 World Energy <lb/>Outlook, reducing electricity end‐use demand alone accounts for one‐third of reduced <lb/>greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 to 15 years in the 450 ppm scenario. The potential for <lb/>end‐use efficiency improvements is enormous. National studies of economic energy efficiency <lb/>improvements routinely estimate an economic energy savings potential of 20 to 25 percent over <lb/>the next decade (McKinsey, 2009). Based on such projections, some governments have set <lb/>ambitious targets of 10 to 15 percent for networked energy sales (gas and electricity) over the <lb/>next decade (The State and Local Energy Efficiency Action Network, 2011). <lb/>Seen from an electricity security viewpoint, such projections beg the question of whether <lb/>networked energy providers should plan based on historical demand growth trends or demand <lb/>reductions to be achieved in response to energy savings targets. The answer is mixed. In the EU, <lb/>progress towards the 20/20 energy savings target set in 2006 has fallen well short through 2012. <lb/>Recognizing this, the European Parliament and Council of Ministers recently enacted a new <lb/>Energy Efficiency Directive containing binding measures, not least of which are annual energy <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 33 <lb/>savings targets for energy providers. 9 If EU Member States enact these targets and energy <lb/>providers meet them, the result would be a 9% reduction on final energy sales over the period <lb/>2014 to 2020. In other jurisdictions with extensive energy efficiency programmes – Australia, the <lb/>Pacific Northwest and New England – electricity sales are on a downward trend. In Australia, <lb/>according to the AEMO&apos;s 2012 Electricity Statement of Opportunities, 10 <lb/> &quot; the reduction in growth in electricity demand in Australia may be attributable to changes in <lb/>the economic outlook, including a short‐term moderation in gross domestic surplus (GDP), <lb/>reduced manufacturing consumption and consumer response to rising electricity prices and <lb/>energy efficiency measures &quot; . <lb/>Uncertainty in demand forecasts, however, is nothing new. Power planners, load forecasters and <lb/>regulators have long experience in techniques to hedge for uncertainty and maintain electricity <lb/>security. <lb/>Carbon capture and storage progress <lb/>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) <lb/>emissions from electricity generation. In the IEA publication Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 <lb/>(IEA, 2012a), CCS contributes slightly more than one‐fifth of energy‐related emissions reductions <lb/>between 2015 and 2050 in the 2°C Scenario (2DS). Approximately half of emissions reductions <lb/>resulting from the application of CCS under the 2DS are from power generation, with 63% of coal‐ <lb/>fired generation, 18% of gas and 9% of biomass generation equipped with CCS by 2050. 11 <lb/>Despite the majority of support for CCS demonstration being focused on power generation <lb/>applications (Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, 2011), none of the four currently‐ <lb/>operating large‐scale integrated projects (LSIPs) that carry out sufficient monitoring to <lb/>demonstrate permanent storage of CCS are related to power generation. Of the seven LSIPs under <lb/>construction, only two involve capture of CO 2 from power generation. 12 <lb/>All of necessary technologies exist today for CCS to be applied to power generation, but require <lb/>demonstration at large scale before they can be considered commercially viable. Capture <lb/>technologies for power generation (i.e. pre‐combustion, post‐combustion and oxy‐combustion) <lb/>are at different stages of readiness, but are generally in pilot‐testing stages for coal and gas‐fired <lb/>generation (IEA, 2012a, p. 339). However, CCS deployment rates are currently woefully off pace to <lb/>reach the approximately 16 GW of CCS equipped power generation in 2020 in the 2DS, and both <lb/>government and industry need to redouble efforts to demonstrate CCS at commercial scale <lb/>(i.e. hundreds of megawatts and up) for CCS to get back on track to meeting its emissions <lb/>reduction potential. <lb/>The cost of electricity from power plants fitted with CCS is expected to become generally <lb/>competitive with that of other low‐carbon technologies such as wind or solar power. However, <lb/>widespread CCS deployment will not occur without strong and credible emissions reduction <lb/>policies from governments, additional funding for CCS demonstration and deployment, and clear <lb/>deployment strategies and policies for CCS technologies. Significant work remains to be done <lb/>across these areas. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 34 <lb/>How does the transition affect security of electricity supply? <lb/>Thanks to recent renewable policies, compounded with declining costs of wind on shore and solar <lb/>PV, renewables represented about half of the capacity installed in the United States and the <lb/>European Union in 2011 (Figures 9 and 10). IEA 450 ppm scenario indicates that further <lb/>decarbonisation of the power sector is necessary to achieve the global goal of stabilising <lb/>temperature to 2 degrees Celsius. In this scenario, investment in low‐carbon generating capacity <lb/>comprises 55% of total new capacity from now until 2020, and 91% from 2020 to 2035. Recent EU <lb/>2050 scenarios indicate similar trends, place great emphasis on the role of renewables, with <lb/>scenarios with very high shares of renewables. <lb/>Figure 9 • Investment in the United States by technology group, 2002‐2009 <lb/>Figure 10 • Investment in Europe by technology group, 2000‐2011 Europe <lb/>These developments take place in a context in which electricity demand is sluggish in most OECD <lb/>countries, mainly due to the economic crisis following a period to high growth. The bad news is <lb/>that most of the countries have excess capacity and therefore market prices are relatively low <lb/>which leads to a low profitability of existing assets. The good news is that these countries do not <lb/>face serious security of supply issues before at least the end of the decade. As a result, most <lb/>governments and policy makers are not very concerned with electricity security of supply, except <lb/>in a few countries.

This raises <lb/>another related set of questions: are the current market arrangements capable to deliver enough <lb/>capacity during peak periods in order to ensure generation adequacy? Does this change the <lb/>capability of the market arrangements to deliver the investments needed? How the market <lb/>arrangements should be changed in order to ensure market based investments in capacity <lb/>necessary to maintain electricity security of supply? <lb/>Figure 11 summarizes the impact of the different energy policies on the functioning of the price <lb/>setting mechanism on electricity markets: <lb/>1. The carbon price increases the marginal cost of fossil fuel‐fired power plants, pushing the <lb/>electricity price‐up. <lb/>2. Most renewable capacity has a null marginal cost and policy‐induced investments displace the <lb/>merit order to the right hand side, reducing prices as well as the load factor of existing <lb/>dispatchable plants. <lb/>3. Nuclear capacity remains a matter of public policy. Germany nuclear phase‐out (or <lb/>conversely, UK nuclear policy) will displace the merit order, and tend to increase (resp. <lb/>decrease) market prices. <lb/>4. Energy efficiency policies aim at decreasing demand, which would have the effect to lower <lb/>electricity prices. <lb/>5. Capacity mechanisms, where they exist, aim at ensuring adequate capacity to meet peak <lb/>demand, thereby avoiding hours of scarcity and the associated high prices. <lb/>Overall, the combined effects of these policies will depend on the installed capacity and the age of <lb/>power plants. For instance, countries like the United Kingdom, where a large fraction of the <lb/>generation capacity will be shut down in the coming years, may face more urgent problems. <lb/>Policy makers are now quartered between the urgency to accelerate climate action imperative <lb/>and its potential costs for the economy in the coming years, in a context of slow international <lb/>climate negotiations and economic crisis. Uncertain climate policies will magnify the challenges <lb/>faced by the power industry to deliver reliable and secure market‐based investments. <lb/>Figure 11 • The impact of energy policies on the functioning of electricity markets <lb/>CO 2 <lb/>Renewables <lb/>Nuclear <lb/>Coal <lb/>CCGT <lb/>Peaking <lb/>units <lb/>Reserve margin <lb/>Renewables <lb/>targets <lb/>Nuclear <lb/>policies <lb/>CO2 <lb/>CO2 <lb/>CO 2 <lb/>price <lb/>Capacity <lb/>mechanisms <lb/>Smart Grids and <lb/>Energy Efficiency <lb/>Capacity <lb/>(MW) <lb/>Marginal Cost <lb/>($/MWh) <lb/>Market <lb/>Regulation <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 36 <lb/>3. Operating challenges <lb/>At significant penetration levels, generation using variable renewable energy presents challenges <lb/>to system operations on account of the uncertain and variable output of renewable sources. <lb/>These challenges are emerging in several leading countries and have been analysed in several <lb/>recent publications, including Smith et al (2010), DENA (2010), Neuhoff, K et al. (2011) and the IEA <lb/>(2006 and 2011), Eirgrid and Soni (2011) and NREL (2011). <lb/>This section examines the challenges associated with the integration of increasing shares of <lb/>variable renewable energy (VRE) for system operations. These challenges are not new, since it has <lb/>always been necessary to handle variable demand and uncertainty regarding possible <lb/>contingencies. However, at high penetration levels of variable renewables, i.e. above 20% of <lb/>annual generation, the increase of variability and uncertainty leads to new challenges. The four <lb/>challenges are summarized in the following table. <lb/>Table 4 • Overview of operating challenges of renewable integration <lb/>Peak load generation adequacy <lb/>Generation adequacy is the ability of the electricity system to meet electricity demand with a <lb/>reasonably high probability during periods of high load. The system operator needs to have <lb/>enough capacity available during the hours where electricity demand is the highest, plus a reserve <lb/>margin to cope with contingencies. Adequacy is generally assessed using indicators such as the <lb/>probability of lost load or the expected duration of load curtailment. <lb/>The maximum output of wind and solar generation vary according to weather conditions and time <lb/>of day. Consequently, assessing the amount of power they can be expected to produce with a <lb/>reasonable degree of confidence when demand is the highest is challenging. This &quot; capacity credit &quot; <lb/>of renewables depends on the correlation between wind, sun and demand. (If solar generation <lb/>correlates with peak demand due to air conditioning, as is the case in California, then the capacity <lb/>credit may be high.) According to recent IEA estimates, capacity credits of solar and wind range <lb/>from 0% to 20% of their installed nominal capacity in different regions (IEA, 2011a and IEA, <lb/>2011c). Other studies indicate higher capacity credit of 38% for solar (PJM, 2010).

Despite investments in variable renewable generation <lb/>capacity, other resources such as the conventional plants, demand response and storage will be <lb/>needed to ensure adequacy. In the medium term, conventional generation is bound to take the <lb/>bulk of this function. These conventional plants run less frequently and produce less energy, <lb/>which changes their economics and therefore tend to favour less capital-intensive technologies, <lb/>such as open-cycle gas turbines, instead of combined-cycle gas turbines. <lb/>Minimum load balancing <lb/>The opposite of peak load, minimum load balancing refers to the need to maintain generation <lb/>equal to the load during periods of low consumption, generally on Sundays or during the summer <lb/>period of cold climate countries. These situations of minimum residual load do not necessarily <lb/>occur during periods of low demand and they have implications for all markets, including the day-<lb/>ahead market, intra-day or balancing and ancillary services markets. Little consideration has been <lb/>given to these situations of low load, as it is usually sufficient to shut down plants during a few <lb/>days or at night time when they are not needed. <lb/>Figure 12 • Peak load adequacy and minimum load balancing <lb/>Lost Load <lb/>Rigid <lb/>Flexi <lb/>-ble <lb/>Margin <lb/>VRE <lb/>Rigid <lb/>Flexi <lb/>-ble <lb/>Margin <lb/>VRE <lb/>Rigid <lb/>Flexi <lb/>-ble <lb/>Margin <lb/>VRE <lb/>Lost <lb/>Prod <lb/>Load <lb/>Rigid <lb/>Flexi <lb/>-ble <lb/>Margin <lb/>VRE <lb/>peak load <lb/>adequacy <lb/>minimum load <lb/>balancing <lb/>Unused <lb/>VRE <lb/>capacity <lb/>Load <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 38 <lb/>To date, while wind and solar do not exceed 20% in Germany Ireland and Texas, there is already <lb/>enough to see the first signs of operating tensions during low load hours: <lb/>1. Wind can be the marginal fuel when wind generation exceeds load, as it is the case in the <lb/>West Zone of Texas (Figure 13); <lb/>2. Wind generation has to be curtailed in Ireland by about 1% of total wind output and up to <lb/>7.5% of wind output for certain wind farms (Eirgrid and Soni, 2011), in order to maintain <lb/>electricity security given current operation practices; 13 <lb/>3. Negative prices can occur if wind has to be dispatched and conventional load are running at <lb/>their minimal technical level and want to avoid shut down for economic reasons or must be <lb/>kept online for system security reason (Figure 15). <lb/>Figure 13 • Marginal fuel frequency, ERCOT, West Zone <lb/>Source: Potomac Economics, 2010 State of the Market Report for ERCOT. <lb/>Figure 14 • Unused wind generation (MWh) Jan‐Nov 2010 <lb/>Source: Eirgrid and Soni (2011). <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 39 <lb/>Negative prices can result when there are high levels of renewable energy, because the primary <lb/>energy source of fuel is costless and renewable energy is frequently subsidised through feed‐in <lb/>tariffs paid if electricity is generated. Frequent and sustained negative prices will lead to <lb/>depressed revenues for units at the margin and this is likely to have an impact on the viability of <lb/>existing conventional generation. As variable renewable generation becomes a significant source <lb/>of energy across many IEA member countries there are arguments that the policies designed to <lb/>favour renewable energy may need to adapt so that there is more coherence across fuels. <lb/>Figure 15 • Negative prices in Germany (2012) <lb/>Source: RWE Innogy. <lb/>Spain has successfully adapted its electricity system to accommodate a very significant share of <lb/>variable renewable energy (in 2011, wind and solar generated 18.3% of energy), a paucity of <lb/>interconnections of the Spanish peninsular system. New legislation (Royal Decree 1565/2010) <lb/>entered into force and the system operator Red Eléctrica de España (REE) has taken several <lb/>actions, notably developing the first national Control Centre for Renewable Energies (CECRE), the <lb/>introduction of a new grid code, the increased participation of wind generation to voltage control, <lb/>and the increase of demand‐side management (REE, 2012). Looking forward, the development of <lb/>storage technologies and the development of international interconnections are foreseen to <lb/>further facilitate the integration of wind and solar power. <lb/>As variable renewables reach 20% to 30% of electricity generated, there will be a multiplication of <lb/>situations of &quot; excess &quot; renewable generation, which indicates that balancing areas have become <lb/>saturated. In these situations, balancing the power system during periods of low load will <lb/>necessitate further adaptations to maintain the physical parameters of the network. An ongoing <lb/>IEA work within the Grid Integration of Variable Renewables project (GIVAR) analyses these <lb/>options in more detail. This includes the following: <lb/> Consuming more power during periods of low load, either by final consumers or by electricity <lb/>storage facilities such as pumped‐hydro; <lb/> Exporting more through interconnection capacity. However, if neighbouring systems have <lb/>also reached high penetration levels, this interconnection is only a viable option to the extent <lb/>€/MWh <lb/>MW <lb/>Power price <lb/>Load <lb/>Wind generation <lb/>250 <lb/>250 <lb/>250 <lb/>100 <lb/>50 <lb/>0 <lb/>‐50 <lb/>‐100 <lb/>01/01 <lb/>02/01 <lb/>03/01 <lb/>03/01 <lb/>03/01 <lb/>06/01 <lb/>50 000 <lb/>40 000 <lb/>30 000 <lb/>20 000 <lb/>10 000 <lb/>0 <lb/>‐10 000 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 40 <lb/>that high output periods or peak demand do not typically coincide between regions; and <lb/> Reducing the minimum output required from conventional generation plants to maintain <lb/>network stability. <lb/>The technical and economic potential to increase demand may be limited, interconnections are <lb/>slow to develop and provide only a partial solution. Hence, it will be necessary in the next <lb/>20 years to keep some conventional power plants online to provide ancillary services and ramp‐up <lb/>capabilities. Consequently, renewables also will have to play an increasing role to balance the <lb/>network during low load situations. Figure 16 shows this issue with a modelled load duration <lb/>curve corresponding to 80% of renewables in an isolated balancing area. During periods with low <lb/>load or excess generation, wind and solar will probably have to reduce their output to maintain <lb/>network security. <lb/>Minimum load balancing constraints have important implications for the design of both <lb/>renewable support mechanisms and the design of electricity markets. As more wind and more <lb/>solar power plants are coming on line, granting them priority dispatch only constrained by <lb/>security of supply reasons may become highly uneconomical. Instead, renewable plants could <lb/>participate in the market by providing a dollar per MWh bid below which they are no longer <lb/>willing to generate. These bids should reflect the marginal cost of production of the plants (which <lb/>is close to zero). <lb/>Renewable curtailment on economic grounds immediately yields another question: which <lb/>renewable plants should be dispatched? To that end, a locational marginal pricing framework <lb/>would be helpful to attain the least cost dispatch and curtailment decisions should reflect the <lb/>impact of different renewable generators on losses and congestions on the network. <lb/>From a technical standpoint, steps are also being taken by wind plant designers to enable greater <lb/>flexibility in operation of the plant themselves (Smith et al, 2010). Active power control algorithms <lb/>can limit wind plant output during curtailment events. Reactive power control is also available to <lb/>enable voltage control of the plant output, even at no load in some cases. <lb/>Figure 16 • Illustrative residual load duration curve and renewable curtailments <lb/>20 <lb/>Hours <lb/>100 <lb/>80 <lb/>60 <lb/>40 <lb/>0 <lb/>‐20 <lb/>‐40 <lb/>Load (GW) <lb/>Renewable generation curtailment <lb/>Lack of flexibility <lb/>Excess <lb/>supply <lb/>Minimum dispatchable generation <lb/>Residual load (taking into account demand <lb/>side management, storage and exports) <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 41 <lb/>Ramps and start-ups <lb/>Reliable operation of the power system requires real time matching of supply and demand, which <lb/>implies ramping the aggregated output up and down. The graph below shows that traditional <lb/>variability of consumption in France can typically increase by 6.5 to 7.5 GW in one hour between <lb/>6:00 and 7:00 for a typical winter day, during which generation has to be ramped up accordingly. <lb/>Different generation technologies can contribute to meet ramp-up needs; nuclear reactors must <lb/>be already operating in a part load mode, below their available output, so as to be able to ramp <lb/>up during the morning hours. Other generation plants such as hydro and gas turbines can <lb/>technically provide high ramp rates and can be made available to follow load. <lb/>Figure 17 • Electricity consumption in France on 22 March 2012 <lb/>Increased penetration of wind and solar will change the shape of the residual demand curve that <lb/>needs to be followed by conventional generation plants. Flexibility of conventional plants (ramp-<lb/>up/down, startup/shutdown, reserve capabilities, etc.) might be more frequently and intensively <lb/>called upon. Modelling results (Figure 18) for the United Kingdom with a very high share of <lb/>renewables (80%) and a wind-heavy portfolio shows many hours of excess VRE output (negative <lb/>residual load). The hourly variation in residual load could exceed 10 GW/hour and can reach <lb/>40 GW/hour during windy hours (about half of the system peak load), should wind benefit from <lb/>priority dispatch run at available output. <lb/>Ensuring network reliability under such conditions will require a series of actions, including relying <lb/>on storage and demand response. Interconnections will be particularly valuable for the <lb/>aggregation of loads in different countries and to smooth wind output variations when a weather <lb/>front passes through wind plants distributed over hundred of kilometres. <lb/>However, the ramping capability is not generally perceived as a major barrier for the deployment <lb/>of renewables in the foreseeable future for several reasons: <lb/>+6.5 GW <lb/>MW <lb/>50 000 <lb/>52 000 <lb/>54 000 <lb/>56 000 <lb/>58 000 <lb/>60 000 <lb/>62 000 <lb/>64 000 <lb/></body>

Similarly, the ability to enable a <lb/>limit in the &quot; up &quot; ramp of renewables can be technically possible during normal operations and <lb/>has proven to be very helpful in maintaining reliable operations (Smith et al., 2010). <lb/>Conversely, when large &quot; down &quot; ramp of renewables are forecasted, renewable output may be <lb/>reduced in advance so as to control the ramp rates, if this is the most economic choice for the <lb/>system. <lb/>At present, in many electricity markets, wind and solar generally do not participate in the supply <lb/>of ramping needs. Exposing variable renewables to the electricity and balancing markets risks can <lb/>change this behaviour, as undistorted markets could provide for a level playing field of a sufficient <lb/>quality and quantity of flexible reserves. Where organised markets are mandatory, it may be <lb/>required to define new products, for instance standardized flexibility products that could reveal a <lb/>price for flexibility. Renewables should also be able to participate in these markets. <lb/>Figure 18 • Hourly variability of residual load with high shares of renewables (United Kingdom with 80% <lb/>of renewables) <lb/>The number of cycling and start‐ups of power plants is also expected to increase with high shares <lb/>of variable renewables. Typically, a gas power plant will need to operate during morning peak <lb/>demand, then stops generating when the sun is shining during the day and then resumes <lb/>operations for the evening peak, before stopping it at night when demand is lower. This will add <lb/>start‐up costs, and reducing the expected technical life time of some assets. While state‐of‐the‐art <lb/>CCGTs are capable of start and stop operations, most of the installed capacity has not been <lb/>designed to be operated in such an intermittent mode. In addition, existing market design does <lb/>not necessarily provide an adequate remuneration of these start‐up and cycling costs. <lb/>Residual Load <lb/>MW <lb/>Hourly change <lb/>MW <lb/>Variation in residual load <lb/>between two adjacent hours <lb/>(h to h+1) <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 43 <lb/>Predictability <lb/>In addition to being variable, wind and solar generation are also uncertain. Whereas demand <lb/>uncertainty on a day‐ahead time‐scale is typically in the range of 1‐2% of load, the mean absolute <lb/>error for wind is 15%, 24 hours before real time. Commercial providers of forecasting solutions <lb/>claim that they can reach a forecast error to 5%, 24 hours before real time. 14 Centralisation of <lb/>information concerning weather forecasts and improvements of forecasting models will reduce <lb/>this uncertainty. On the other hand, higher penetration of wind and solar will add to the <lb/>uncertainty of day‐ahead scheduling, day‐ahead transmission analysis and security‐constrained, <lb/>unit commitment program. <lb/>There is also a risk that large off‐shore wind farms are set out during storms (storm protection <lb/>shut‐down typically happens at wind speeds above 25 metre/second). In that case, a high <lb/>expected output from off‐shore wind is not delivered. <lb/>Uncertain wind and solar generation forecasts increase the need for flexibility closer to real time. <lb/>As a result, wind uncertainty may yield a need to redefine the amount of reserves required to <lb/>maintain the standard of power system security. In Spain, REE estimated that +0.5 GW of <lb/>additional reserves are needed for 10 GW of wind. In Germany, DENA (2010) forecasts + 3 GW of <lb/>additional reserves for 36 GW of VRE by 2015. <lb/>To provide this type of flexibility, demand response can be a competitive solution. Low‐cost <lb/>demand responses already exist in many markets, such as Denmark, where district heating <lb/>providers have installed boilers. The existing potential of low‐cost demand response for large <lb/>users running capital intensive factories or industrial facilities must be assessed and the pace of <lb/>development of smart grids remains uncertain. <lb/>Other strategies can be developed to control balancing costs. Large balancing areas and <lb/>geographic diversity of wind resources can help to optimise the balancing costs. Improving the <lb/>design of electricity markets is another important lever to control these costs. In several US <lb/>markets and in Australia, sub‐hourly energy markets are integrated and co‐optimised with <lb/>ancillary services markets. In Europe, where balancing services are traded on separate markets <lb/>than energy, balancing prices are correlated to energy prices but tend to be more expensive. As a <lb/>result, utilities prefer to reschedule their unit commitment program of their own portfolio of <lb/>power plants rather than being exposed to the balancing market. In that case, allowing intra‐day <lb/>trade and rescheduling until one hour before real time could reduce the exposure to the <lb/>balancing market risk and lower the balancing costs for market participants (IEA, 2011d). <lb/></body>

Investment issues <lb/> &quot; The unprecedented combination of the global financial crisis, tough environmental targets, <lb/>increasing gas import dependency and the closure of ageing power stations has combined to <lb/>cast reasonable doubt over whether the current energy arrangements will deliver secure and <lb/>sustainable energy supplies. &quot; Ofgem (2010). <lb/>As Joskow (2007) already pointed out, <lb/> &quot; These policy concerns have not disappeared. On the contrary, they are now exacerbated by <lb/>the consequences of increasing shares of policy‐driven variable renewables, which can further <lb/>undermine the functioning of electricity markets and may distort incentives to invest. &quot; <lb/>The market and regulatory frameworks are keys to electricity security of supply, also expressed in <lb/>terms of reliability and generation adequacy. In most cases, these concerns have been raised <lb/>because policy makers have observed a reduction of profitability of existing assets, with some <lb/>generators planning to mothball power plants that may be necessary to meet system load at <lb/>times of low variable RE generation. In some markets, most notably continental Europe, the <lb/>absence of investments does not necessarily put generation adequacy at risk. On the contrary, in <lb/>a situation of economic crisis, slow electricity demand growth and excess capacity, stopping <lb/>investments is exactly what we expect from well‐functioning electricity markets. Several <lb/>countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, Greece and Spain enjoy comfortable <lb/>reserve margins and enough flexible gas‐fired capacity to accommodate high shares of variable <lb/>renewables and do not need investments in the next ten years. <lb/>However, ageing and polluting power plants built in the 1970s will be retired in the coming years <lb/>in many OECD countries. In some cases, policy makers forecast shrinking reserve margins but little <lb/>evidence of adequate investments in new generating capacity. This is the case of Ercot in Texas, <lb/>California and the United Kingdom. This new investment cycle will constitute a major test for <lb/>competitive markets and one of the last opportunities to decarbonise the electricity mix by 2050. <lb/>Many economists, as well as the IEA (2007), recommend well‐functioning electricity markets as <lb/>the efficient solution, provided that prices can rise high enough during periods of scarcity, and <lb/>that there is a stable regulatory framework. Yet a growing number of countries have recently <lb/>adopted new rules mandating system operators to contract for generation capacity (New Zealand, <lb/>Ontario, California, Norway and Sweden) or have introduced explicit margin or capacity targets <lb/>(PJM, Italy, Australia&apos;s eastern states and Latin America). Many other countries are actively <lb/>introducing new regulatory arrangements to ensure that enough capacity will be available in the <lb/>future to ensure reliable system operations (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Belgium). <lb/>In this section we find that, based on the analysis of the experience in several OECD countries, <lb/>there are a number of imperfections in market design and uncertainties about energy policy that <lb/>substantially increase the risk associated with new investments in generation capacity. These <lb/>factors are tending to delay investment decisions. If this situation is allowed to persist, it will lead <lb/>to underinvestment in generating capacity, and to higher prices or involuntary rolling blackouts. <lb/>These problems are currently exacerbated by the ongoing economic and financial crisis in Europe, <lb/>which reduces the appetite for high risk investment, and by issues with local acceptance that can <lb/>increase the lead time of new projects. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 46 <lb/>Figure 20 • Overview of investment issues <lb/>Most of the issues associated with investment in new generating capacity pertain to the energy <lb/>industry itself and reflect real or expected problems with the design of wholesale electricity <lb/>markets and the impact that energy and climate policies have on electricity markets. <lb/>It is often argued that electricity markets do not provide sufficient certainty of revenues to attract <lb/>investment, either for peaking units, mid‐merit power plants or for low‐carbon investments. In <lb/>addition, high shares of variable renewables increase the price and load factor risks. In other <lb/>words, expected prices may be quite high, but too unpredictable and too volatile to ensure a <lb/>proper remuneration of the cost of capital (risk‐adjusted) used by investors to evaluate <lb/>investments in new generation capacity in liberalised markets. Even if prices can be very high <lb/>during a few hours, these peak price episodes are too rare and provide irregular/intermittent <lb/>revenues that may fail to attract enough investment in new generation to meet reliability criteria. <lb/>The argument is similar for low‐carbon investments. According to this view, long‐lived and high <lb/>fixed cost, low‐carbon investments are exposed to the electricity market price risk, which depend <lb/>not only on volatile and uncertain fossil fuel prices like coal and gas; but also on carbon price risk. <lb/>In addition, some low‐carbon investments such as nuclear and CCS could be exposed to the load <lb/>factor risk associated with high deployment of variable renewables. If market players are usually <lb/>well‐equipped to handle fossil fuel price risk, they are less well placed to tackle the carbon price <lb/>risk and renewable policy risk, in particular, the risk of a low‐carbon price. These arguments then <lb/>lead to conclude that liberalised electricity sectors can provide neither the low‐carbon investment <lb/>needed, nor the investments in conventional generation to ensure security of supply at <lb/>reasonable cost. <lb/>It is often also argued that, in addition to being volatile, wholesale electricity prices and ancillary <lb/>services cannot provide sufficient revenues to attract adequate investments. One reason is that <lb/>prices can not go high enough to cover both operating costs and capital investment costs required <lb/>to trigger investment in new capacity. These peak pricing restrictions are known in the economics <lb/>literature as the missing money problem. Problems can also arise if markets for specific products <lb/>Cash flows volatility <lb/>and variability <lb/>Load factor risk <lb/>Price restrictions <lb/>Incomplete markets <lb/>Peak prices depend on weather conditions. <lb/>Fossil and carbon prices risk <lb/>Deploying renewables reduces load factors. <lb/>Price caps reduce prices during peak periods, <lb/>leading to underinvestment <lb/>Flexibility not (or poorly) remunerated <lb/>Local acceptability issue <lb/>Financial crisis <lb/>General <lb/>context <lb/>Issues <lb/>pertaining <lb/>to energy <lb/>Utilities&apos; capacity to invest and <lb/>credit rationing due to regulatory changes <lb/>Build absolutely nothing anywhere near <lb/>anything (banana) <lb/>Energy policy risk <lb/>Stop and go of renewables policies <lb/>and uncertain environmental regulations <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 47 <lb/>are missing or products are not well defined, as might be the case for flexibility services which are <lb/>increasingly needed to handle growing shares of renewables. We will refer to this problem as the <lb/>missing market problem. <lb/>Market participants often state that energy policy risk may make the electricity industry difficult <lb/>to invest ( &quot; uninvestable &quot; ). Market rules change too frequently. Government or regulators have <lb/>opportunities to &quot; hold‐up &quot; incumbents by imposing new regulatory constraints in the future or <lb/>deploying policies affecting negatively the profitability of previous investments. Energy policies <lb/>may be too costly and exposed to backlash from taxpayers or ratepayers. This creates an unstable <lb/>investment environment and the lack of credibility of some policies acts as a deterrent to new <lb/>investments. Furthermore, the lack of commitment towards liberalization and unceasing <lb/>discussions concerning further market reforms tend to delay investment decisions, in order to <lb/>wait for announced evolutions of the regulatory framework, as real option theory would suggest. <lb/>The perspective to have regulatory intervention in case of generation adequacy problem may <lb/>create a self‐fulfilling prophecy. <lb/>In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of these generation investment issues, with <lb/>a particular focus to the implications of energy policies undertaken by governments. <lb/>The impact of the financial and economic crisis <lb/>In the wake of the financial crisis which started in 2008, the situation in the banking industry <lb/>made it virtually impossible to finance any kind of conventional power plant on a project‐finance <lb/>basis. Previously in the 2000s, several merchant gas power plants in the United States filed for <lb/>bankruptcy. Given the current financial context, securing financing is increasingly difficult for <lb/>project developers to achieve. <lb/>The banking industry argues that investment is therefore likely to come mainly from utilities at <lb/>the moment, and financed on balance sheet. But even this will be limited owing to the fact that <lb/>most utilities, even large ones, have to face low profitability of existing assets, and issues in terms <lb/>of equity and credit rating. Indeed, they suffer from the consequences of the economic crisis <lb/>which has created excess generating capacity and low electricity prices, reducing their EBITDA and <lb/>constraining their ability to invest. This is particularly a concern when it comes to financing large <lb/>projects such as nuclear power plants or large off‐shore wind farms, owing to the fact that only <lb/>one of those multibillion investment projects is enough to have an impact on the credit rating of <lb/>even the largest utilities. These factors tend to increase the weighted average cost of capital <lb/>(WACC) used by utilities to finance new projects. <lb/>In addition, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the recession in some countries, financial <lb/>regulatory changes (most notably Basel 3 tighter capital adequacy requirement) and the <lb/>restructuring of financial institutions, all these elements create one of the most challenging <lb/>environment for banks to finance any investment in general, and the more risky ones in <lb/>particular. Bank credit rationing can lead to situations where investment projects with a positive <lb/>net present value, are not built because of lack of financing. <lb/>It is often argued that the electricity sector will need to rely on new categories of investors <lb/>(pension funds or sovereign investors); in order to find the trillion dollars needed to finance the <lb/>new investments in the coming decades to replace ageing capacity and decarbonise the electricity <lb/>mix. However, attracting these investors is not free lunch and would call for serving them an <lb/>appropriate risk‐return proposition. Moreover, these pure financial players are less familiar with <lb/>the specificities and subtle market design issues of electricity markets. As such, they are less able <lb/>to find proper risk mitigation strategies and thus will either not invest or add a risk premium on <lb/>their cost of capital, increasing their expected returns on investment in the power generation <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 48 <lb/>industry. Indeed, the most important issue for investors to tackle seems to be the revenue risk of <lb/>new power plants, as investors engage in a &quot; flight to quality &quot; in the current uncertain <lb/>macroeconomic times. <lb/>Interestingly, financing is not an issue for all generation investments. Renewable projects <lb/>continue to attract proper financing, even in period of tight financing conditions. Unlike the case <lb/>of market‐based investments, they benefit from feed‐in tariffs, priority dispatch or alternatively, <lb/>power purchase agreements (PPA). This suggests that revenue risk is a key topic in the electricity <lb/>sector. <lb/>More basically, investments in some markets, in particular in Europe, do not happen just because <lb/>they are not needed. With the notable exception of the United Kingdom, most European <lb/>countries enjoy comfortable reserve margins, excess capacity and generation adequacy is not a <lb/>concern for the next 10 years (ENTSO‐E, 2010). <lb/>Local acceptability issues <lb/>IEA member countries are increasingly confronted with local acceptability issues in their day‐to <lb/>day activities. This effect is often referred to as &quot; build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone &quot; <lb/>(BANANA). While this is mainly a concern for transmission network development, because a <lb/>transmission line has a significant impact on landscapes, finding new sites in some densely <lb/>populated IEA countries is becoming an issue. <lb/>Nuclear power, gas and coal‐fired power plants have also to face anti‐nuclear groups or local <lb/>opposition and new projects tend to be located on existing nuclear or industrial sites. Overall, <lb/>acceptability issues increase the public consultation duration and administrative burden and carry <lb/>the risk of delay of the projects. While this concern is not specific to the energy industry, its <lb/>consequences can be particularly important in the electricity sector if a country faces a shortage <lb/>of suitable sites. Failure to build new capacity on time may lead to situations where electricity <lb/>security cannot be ensured on a national basis. If this is the case, interconnections can contribute <lb/>to ensure security of electricity supply. <lb/>Cash flow volatility and variability <lb/>Uncertain revenues for peaking units <lb/>Electricity markets are characterized by high price volatility due to inelastic demand and volatile <lb/>demand and supply. Potential investors in new generating capacity must expect to cover their <lb/>variable operating and fuel costs, their operation and maintenance costs and their capital costs <lb/>from sale of energy over the lifetime of the power plant. The profitability of generating units that <lb/>are likely to operate only for a relatively small number of hours in each year (peaking capacity) is <lb/>especially sensitive to the level of prices that are realized during the small number of high <lb/>demand hours in which they provide energy or operating reserves. <lb/>Due to yearly variability on the demand and the supply side, these hours erratically fluctuate from <lb/>year to year. Figure 21 shows the notional revenues calculated for a peak power plant in Australia. <lb/>A gas fired power plant running only when prices are above 1000 AUS$/MWh would have earned <lb/>revenues above annual costs only two years in the period 2006‐2011, corresponding to two dry <lb/>years. While average revenues are higher than the average annualized cost of OCGT, such a cash <lb/>flow profile implies a long sequence of losses for investors. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 49 <lb/>Figure 21 • Cost and revenues of notional peaking gas‐fired generators in the South Australian wholesale <lb/>Market, 2006‐2011 <lb/>The price spikes due to scarcity events may be further magnified by other factors such as demand <lb/>growth uncertainty, boom‐bust investment cycles, market power, or regulatory or political <lb/>interventions. <lb/>Policy‐driven development of variable renewable generation can also increase variability on the <lb/>supply side. The probability of having a heat wave or a cold spell is low. The probability that either <lb/>will occur at the same time as a period of low wind and solar output is even lower, which could <lb/>result in scarcity events becoming rarer. <lb/>Do gas plants benefit from a natural hedge on electricity markets? <lb/>Under current market arrangements, wholesale electricity prices reflect the marginal cost of the <lb/>marginal power plant and are thus driven primarily by fossil fuel prices (and where they exist, a <lb/>carbon price). As a result, fossil generators thus benefit from a natural hedge: the difference <lb/>between the electricity sales price and the cost of fuel (the spread) is reasonably stable. However, <lb/>looking to it more carefully, coal and gas power plants have been competing with each other <lb/>intensely, and as a result, one of them can get shifted off the marginal fuel. The key factors <lb/>affecting their position on the merit order are relative coal and gas prices, carbon price and <lb/>residual demand left for thermal generation after renewable plants are dispatched. <lb/>In Germany for example, high gas prices combined with a low‐carbon price have led coal to <lb/>become the dominant marginal fuel and set the clearing price. Gas plants are too expensive given <lb/>the current price of gas. Similarly, in the Netherlands, reduction in coal prices in the last few years <lb/>has resulted in much fewer run hours of even most efficient gas plants. <lb/>Looking forward, coal and gas prices are difficult to project. Assuming that the carbon price in <lb/>Europe will rise significantly, this should give an advantage to gas‐fired plants, let them set the <lb/>marginal price and therefore become more &quot; self‐hedged &quot; , as they used to be perceived until a <lb/>few years ago. Although, the degree of the advantage the higher carbon price can give to gas <lb/>generation will depend on the relativity of coal and gas prices. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2010 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2011 AUD million <lb/>Revenue from pool price periods &gt;$2000/MWh <lb/>Average revenue from pool price periods &gt;$2000/MWh <lb/>CCGT 100 MW, total cost (annualised capital + variable) <lb/>OCGT 100 MW, total cost (annualised capital + variable) <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 50 <lb/>Figure 22 • Clean spark spread, base‐load month ahead, Germany (EUR/MWh) <lb/>Impact of VRE on revenues of mid‐merit plants <lb/>High shares of wind and solar also increase the daily volatility as well as the quarterly and yearly <lb/>variability of revenues for mid‐merit plants such as CCGTs. These plants are running less hours <lb/>and they have to recoup fixed costs during a reduced number of hours which vary from one year <lb/>to the other, depending in particular on weather conditions. <lb/>While this was an issue mainly for peaking units, the deployment of variable renewable increases <lb/>the variability of revenues for mid merit power plants. Having less predictable and more volatile <lb/>cash flows, mid‐merit power plants are more difficult to finance and this could ultimately lead to <lb/>underinvestment if the proper incentives are not restored. <lb/>Long‐term contracts and vertical integration <lb/>It is often proposed that long‐term contracts reflect average spot market prices and could partly <lb/>smooth revenues over time. However, these cash flows are very volatile and it may not be <lb/>possible to find counterparties willing to enter into forward contracts of ten or more years&apos; <lb/>duration to allow investors to hedge such market risks. Furthermore, even if there are no price <lb/>restrictions, price uncertainty will affect the cost of capital used by investors to evaluate projects. <lb/>As Joskow (2007) pointed out, the example of other industries shows that investors finance oil <lb/>refineries, cruise chips and other costly capital projects where there is considerable price <lb/>uncertainty without the security of long term contracts. <lb/>In the electricity sector, retail suppliers of electricity are exposed to wholesale price risk. Partial <lb/>vertical integration between retail supply and generation ownership is emerging in Europe and in <lb/>the US. This can be analysed as an industry response that addresses the issue of financing <lb/>investments and dealing with imperfections in wholesale spot markets. <lb/>Low‐carbon investments <lb/>In Europe, the carbon price is foreseen to be the cornerstone of climate policies and to promote <lb/>low‐carbon investment in the power sector, replacing renewable support policies as these <lb/>technologies reach maturity. In principle, this could work if, despite the risk associated with short‐ <lb/>term volatility of electricity prices and long‐term uncertainty over fossil fuel prices, low‐carbon <lb/>‐20 <lb/>‐15 <lb/>‐10 <lb/>‐5 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>Oct‐2009 <lb/>Jan‐2010 <lb/>Apr‐2010 <lb/>Jul‐2010 <lb/>Oct‐2010 <lb/>Jan‐2011 <lb/>Apr‐2011 <lb/>Jul‐2011 <lb/>Oct‐2011 <lb/>Jan‐2012 <lb/>Apr‐2012 <lb/>Jul‐2012 <lb/>EUR <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 51 <lb/>investments generate a sufficient expected return, in excess of the risk‐adjusted cost of capital. <lb/>Assuming low‐carbon solutions are cost competitive, the optimal mix would lead to some low‐ <lb/>carbon investment. The higher the carbon price, the more low‐carbon investments are made. <lb/>However, the carbon price alone is currently too low in Europe to support nuclear and renewable <lb/>power investment. Assuming a higher carbon price, investors may fear political intervention, <lb/>which undermines the future credibility of the carbon price. <lb/>Confronted with this situation, the UK Administration&apos;s proposed solution has been to introduce <lb/>long‐term contracts that take away electricity market price risk from investors, and are legally <lb/>enforceable and hence credible in a way that the carbon price − even a carbon price floor − is not. <lb/>This proposal, where the government picks up the technologies and transfers part of the risk to <lb/>taxpayers, is a quite noticeable change in the United Kingdom, which pioneered electricity <lb/>liberalisation in the 1990s. <lb/>Another important question regarding low‐carbon investment concerns the functioning of <lb/>electricity markets when marginal costs are low and investment costs of each plant are high. One <lb/>often mentioned issue is that market prices with high shares of renewables would reduce prices <lb/>and undermine the incentives to invest, even with a high carbon price. According to this analysis, <lb/>investments in low‐carbon generation would stop once prices are too low, and may not deliver <lb/>the investment needed in the nearly full decarbonisation scenarios foreseen in 2050. This issue <lb/>calls for further research. <lb/>Load factor risk <lb/>Policy‐induced renewable capacity development, like in Germany or Spain, relies on feed‐in tariffs <lb/>or other support mechanisms which are higher than the electricity price. As a result, there is no <lb/>coordination between demand and investments. On the contrary, while electricity consumption <lb/>has been slowing down, governments have accelerated renewable investments since 2008. The <lb/>implication for Europe is that the residual demand to conventional generators in 2011 was equal <lb/>to the level of 2002. <lb/>Figure 23 • Electricity supplied in Europe, OECD Europe (TWh) <lb/>2 800 <lb/>2 900 <lb/>3 000 <lb/>3 100 <lb/>3 200 <lb/>3 300 <lb/>3 400 <lb/>3 500 <lb/>3 600 <lb/>2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 <lb/>Electricity supplied <lb/>Electricity supplied excl. non hydro renewables <lb/>Renewable <lb/>generation <lb/>(non hydro) <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 52 <lb/>In this context, a major economic effect of renewable deployment is that the residual demand <lb/>(and thus the load factor of conventional power plants) decreases. In addition, the average price <lb/>levels decrease, negative or zero prices can happen, and peaking units are running fewer hours. <lb/>As depicted in the Figure 24 below, it is possible for the sake of the analysis to separate two <lb/>effects: the load duration factor (or compression effect) and the price effect. <lb/>The load factor effect and price effects combine to reduce the profitability of the existing fleet of <lb/>power plants in the short term. Solar generates power during the day, when consumption is <lb/>generally higher. The rapid deployment of solar PV in several European countries has the effect of <lb/>flattening the residual daily demand curve, which used to be served by mid‐merit power plants. <lb/>From this perspective, it could be argued that rapid deployment of renewable energy &quot; holds up &quot; <lb/>existing conventional power plant investment. The major risk here is that renewables push <lb/>existing plants out the market, leading to mothballing. Note that if these mothballed plants are <lb/>needed to meet peak demand for their ramp‐up capability or to contribute to ancillary services, <lb/>then the corresponding markets should remunerate properly (an issue which is discussed later). <lb/>This analysis suggests that the impact of renewables on the generation capacity mix depends not <lb/>only on the target, but also on the pace of deployment of renewables. Green and Vasilakos (2011) <lb/>and NEA (2012) use a simplified model to compute the optimal equilibrium generating mix based <lb/>on a residual load duration curve. In this optimal generation mix, the share of different <lb/>technologies will evolve into less base load and more peak units. But it is remarkable that the <lb/>effect on prices should remain limited in the long run once the system has reached a new <lb/>equilibrium, assuming constant carbon and fuel prices. The reason is that the &quot; equilibrium <lb/>durations &quot; between different technologies depend on the cost composition of different <lb/>generation technologies but are independent from the shape of the residual load duration curve. <lb/>During the transition to low‐carbon electricity, the rate of deployment of renewables may exceed <lb/>the demand growth rate and the need to replace of ageing capacity. Taking a dynamic view, the <lb/>load factor of conventional power plants will not be constant over time, but will be reduced as <lb/>renewables are deployed. Consequently, it is possible to anticipate that a new power plant will <lb/>initially be operated at a higher load factor, and then at a lower utilisation rate, selecting the right <lb/>mix of technologies to serve such a declining market. <lb/>Another issue regarding load factors is their quarterly or yearly variability due to weather <lb/>conditions. The number of hours with prices above variable costs may be difficult to predict, <lb/>increasing the risk for potential investors. While already the case for peaking units, this will also <lb/>become an issue for mid‐merit units. <lb/>As a result, the load factor risk is an issue, but it may be limited mainly to the profitability of <lb/>existing plants in the short run. Our analysis does not suggest that this will be a major issue for <lb/>security of supply, as long as companies investing in new plants are able to anticipate carbon <lb/>prices and levels of development of renewable energy; this will be discussed later in the section <lb/>on regulatory risk. For new investments, the optimal generation mix may evolve over time <lb/>towards less capital‐intensive power plants and will depend on future carbon prices and <lb/>expectations of load factors and of their variability. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 53 <lb/>Figure 24 • Schematic illustration of the impact of renewables on load factors, capacity and prices <lb/>Initial least cost generation mix and full load hours of capacity <lb/>Effect 1: Short run Impact of high shares of renewables on the load factor of existing plants <lb/>Effect 2: Long run optimisation of the mix based on the residual load duration curve <lb/>8000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>2000 <lb/>1000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>20 <lb/>Hours <lb/>100 <lb/>80 <lb/>60 <lb/>40 <lb/>0 <lb/>-20 <lb/>1000 2000 <lb/>5000 6000 7000 8000 <lb/>-40 <lb/>Load (GW) <lb/>1000 <lb/>3700 <lb/>4000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>20 <lb/>100 <lb/>80 <lb/>60 <lb/>40 <lb/>0 <lb/>-20 <lb/>1000 2000 <lb/>5000 6000 7000 8000 <lb/>-40 <lb/>Hours <lb/>Load (GW) <lb/>4000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>20 <lb/>100 <lb/>80 <lb/>60 <lb/>40 <lb/>0 <lb/>-20 <lb/>1000 2000 <lb/>5000 6000 7000 8000 <lb/>-40 <lb/>Hours <lb/>Load (GW) <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 54 <lb/>Price effects (illustrative) <lb/>Peak pricing restrictions <lb/>There is a concern that competitive wholesale electricity markets for energy and operating <lb/>reserves do not provide sufficient net revenues to attract adequate investment in generation <lb/>capacity to meet conventional reliability criteria.

In a market context, the price formation <lb/>process during peak hours characterised by operating reserve shortage is critical for <lb/>understanding whether the market is providing the right signals. However, there are a number of <lb/>wholesale market imperfections and regulatory restrictions on prices, as well as procedures <lb/>utilised by system operators to maintain network security (Joskow, 2007; Cramton and Stoft, <lb/>2005). <lb/>System operations during scarcity conditions <lb/>Only a small fraction of consumers are responding to real time prices (usually a few percent of the <lb/>total load) and this situation will probably remain so at least until the development of smart grids, <lb/>smart homes and smart appliances allow differentiation of usages of electricity according to <lb/>customers&apos; preferences. The consequence is that system operators rely on out‐of‐market <lb/>operations to maintain reliable network operations and avoid non‐price rationing of demand <lb/>(rolling blackouts). The engineering procedures often rely on bilateral contracting with specific <lb/>power plants for network reliability reasons, asking consumers to reduce consumption without <lb/>compensation to maintain security of supply during tight hours, accepting capacity margins below <lb/>their normal level or ultimately reducing voltage. All these actions have the effect of depressing <lb/>peak prices during scarcity conditions and have been presented as the main explanation of the <lb/>missing money problem (Joskow, 2007). <lb/>Market power <lb/>Periods of high demand are those when market power problems are likely to be most severe. If <lb/>capacity is scarce, suppliers even with a small percentage of the market could exercise extreme <lb/>market power. After these peak prices, regulators monitor markets carefully (e.g. energy <lb/>regulators monitor peak prices in several countries, including France) and control bids. In some <lb/>jurisdictions, regulators impose price caps to mitigate market power during peak hours. <lb/>Figure 26 • Peak pricing restrictions <lb/>Source: adapted from Hogan (2011). <lb/>Base Load <lb/>Mid Merit <lb/>P($/MWh) <lb/>Hours <lb/>Base Load <lb/>Mid Merit <lb/>P($/MWh) <lb/>Hours <lb/>Price cap <lb/>$40 <lb/>$90 <lb/>Peak <lb/>Revenues for Peak Generator <lb/>Missing Money <lb/>Price duration curve <lb/>Price duration curve <lb/>with a price cap <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 56 <lb/>Market power is a feature of most electricity markets and this can lead to underinvestment in <lb/>generation capacity, maintaining prices higher than their efficient level (Léautier, 2012) and <lb/>justifying price caps to mitigate market power. In markets which are not sufficiently competitive, <lb/>it is argued that binding price caps are the cause − not the consequence − of under‐investments <lb/>(Léautier, 2012). In that case, removing price restrictions would not necessarily yield adequate <lb/>generation capacity but would only increase monopoly profits. Similarly, capacity mechanisms <lb/>would also probably increase monopoly profits. <lb/>Political interventions <lb/>There is also a risk of political intervention to avoid peak prices. In some countries, sensational <lb/>peak power prices, exceeding 10 or even 100 times the cost of production, are making the <lb/>headlines of newspapers, and these levels of prices are difficult to explain to the public. This <lb/>carries the risk of political interventions to limit price spikes. Anticipation of such political <lb/>interventions may act as a deterrent to investing in power plants that cover their costs through <lb/>peak prices during a limited number of scarcity hours. <lb/>Figure 26 illustrates the consequence of restricting peak prices. Revenues are lower for all types <lb/>of power plants, including peak plants, mid‐merit or base‐load plants that under well functioning <lb/>electricity market conditions should also sell their output at the market price. The existence of <lb/>peak price restrictions therefore distorts the market‐based investment decisions, leading to a <lb/>generation mix that is not the least cost‐efficient one. <lb/>Restricting peak prices is one of the most common rationales for the introduction of further <lb/>market reforms such as capacity markets in several countries. It is therefore crucial to analyse in <lb/>detail the causes of peak price restrictions in order consider all possible solutions, such as <lb/>improving the performance of existing markets, rather than introducing further complex <lb/>regulations such as capacity markets. <lb/>Missing or incomplete flexibility markets <lb/>The supply of energy and various balancing or ancillary services are different possible usages of <lb/>the same power plant. In general, power plants operating below their maximum output can <lb/>provide ramp‐up capability, but in that case, they lose some revenues as they do not sell all the <lb/>power they could produce on the energy market. Arbitrage links energy market prices with <lb/>balancing and ancillary services prices and this creates opportunities to change the operations of <lb/>generating units according to price incentives delivered on these different interrelated power <lb/>markets. <lb/>Markets for operating reserves and balancing services typically define the relevant products fairly <lb/>crudely. The market for reserves or balancing services may not have any locational dimension. <lb/>Generation services are much more differentiated than the basic underlying commodity with <lb/>which they are associated. The system operator may, for example, need generating capacity <lb/>responding in 10 minutes at a particular node of the network (Joskow, 2007). When supplies from <lb/>generators with more specific characteristics are needed, the system operator may rely on <lb/>bilateral out‐of‐market contracts to secure these supplies. These out‐of‐market operations can <lb/>inefficiently depress prices received by other market participants for similar services and do not <lb/>create a transparent price signal to operate efficiently and invest in flexible capacity. <lb/>For instance, if a system operator needs a &quot; quick start &quot; supply or demand response that can supply <lb/>within 15 minutes rather than 30 minutes, it is better to define that as a separate product and to create a <lb/>market for it that is fully integrated with related energy and ancillary service product markets, rather <lb/>than relying on out‐of‐market bilateral arrangements and &quot; must‐run &quot; scheduling (Joskow, 2007). <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 57 <lb/>In addition to short‐term balancing price signals, another issue is that market participants may not <lb/>have the information to accurately forecast the balancing requirements over time, as variable <lb/>renewables become more important on the network. Indeed, balancing services needs differ if <lb/>the system experiences a shortage of quick‐start capability or downward flexibility to handle a <lb/>minimal load situation. However, in most power systems, balancing services tend to be procured <lb/>close to real time, usually after the day‐ahead market, and there are few market design with <lb/>forward markets for balancing services. If system operators were able to anticipate operating <lb/>challenges, forward demand for such balancing products could be created, in order to help <lb/>market participants make the economic case for investments needed to enhance the flexibility of <lb/>existing or new capacity and to contribute to secure power systems. <lb/>Figure 27 • Missing markets <lb/>Energy policy and regulatory risks <lb/>Investment decisions always involve a bet on future economic conditions. Even in a world of <lb/>perfectly stable regulation, investors still face the macroeconomic &quot; structural &quot; risk of electricity <lb/>demand forecasts errors as well as gas and coal price risk that can substantially affect the <lb/>profitability of large and long lived power plant investments. It is widely acknowledged that this <lb/>structural risk is an integral part of the market risk and it is usually factored in the risk‐adjusted <lb/>cost of capital used in the investment decision process. Furthermore, in competitive markets, <lb/>investors have also to make investment decisions based on strategic interactions with others. <lb/>Strategies may be good or not and may result in boom and bust cycles. But here again, it is widely <lb/>recognized that the risk of poor strategic decisions is an integral part of the market risk. <lb/>With investments in the power industry being increasingly done through policy‐driven measures, <lb/>it becomes more difficult to draw the line between market risk and policy or regulatory risk. For <lb/>instance, utilities complain about the impact of renewables on the load factor of conventional <lb/>power plants, most notably, the recent gas‐fired combined cycle.

A Deloitte report 15 found that policy uncertainty was detrimental to <lb/>investment in baseload electricity, including combined cycle gas turbines, and as a result, OCGT <lb/>was considered the lowest risk investment as it has lower capital costs. Deloitte calculated the <lb/>cost of policy uncertainty, in terms of sub‐optimality in investment, characterised by a preference <lb/>for OCGT rather than OCGT. They estimated the cost of policy uncertainty by 2016 as <lb/>AUD 4.73/MWh or AUD 1.2 billion/year (in real 2010 dollar). This increased to AUD 4.73/MWh in <lb/>2020 and in AUD 16/MWh 2024. <lb/>That is not to say that investors should be insulated from policy and regulatory risk.

Figure 29 provides an illustration of the possible impact of policy uncertainty <lb/>on generation adequacy forecasts. First, policy‐driven renewable energy introduces uncertainties, <lb/>including the pace of deployment of renewables and the existence and ambitions of future <lb/>renewable policies, in particular beyond 2020 in Europe. <lb/>Second, in the light of historical experience, ambitious energy efficiency policies may remain <lb/>tainted with uncertainty, and this will exacerbate demand forecast errors.

In the <lb/>United Kingdom, the ongoing nuclear policy began in 2008 and the first new nuclear reactors are <lb/>not expected before 2018, if the reform proceeds successfully.

			<body>Page | 60 <lb/>Stakeholders complain about the uncertainty over the future path of regulation and changing and <lb/>overlapping policies regarding renewables, carbon and energy efficiency risk. The associated <lb/>political and regulatory risks could constitute one of the major deterrents for new investment in <lb/>the liberalised electricity market. It is often argued that this can lead in the medium term to <lb/>serious generation adequacy concern, higher prices and inefficient investment decisions made in <lb/>emergency mode. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 61 <lb/>5. Policy options <lb/>Addressing the operating challenges and investment issues discussed in the previous sections will <lb/>require an adaptation of regulatory and market frameworks. Even though countries face different <lb/>supply and demand features, jeopardizing security of electricity supply is never an option. <lb/>However, security of electricity supply in a country with large hydro reservoirs is not the same as <lb/>for a country with a lot of variable wind or, to take another example, an ageing generation <lb/>capacity. Each country will need to find the solution best suited to its situation. <lb/>This section provides an overview of the toolbox for policy makers concerned with electricity <lb/>security aiming to rapidly reduce CO2 emissions from power generation and at the same time to <lb/>preserve or develop liberalised electricity markets. The perspective taken here is the market <lb/>segment of generation, i.e. the segment that is fully exposed to market price risk. The time <lb/>horizon considered is the next 10 to 20 years, corresponding to the period which is relevant for <lb/>the business plans of power projects currently being considered by investors. Note that most of <lb/>the instruments described here are not relevant in electricity systems where investment decisions <lb/>are regulated, where the share of each technology is approved or tendered by a central body. <lb/>Five sets of policy measures can be identified that contribute directly or indirectly to enhance the <lb/>security of electricity supply. Some of them should be pursued in any case to improve the <lb/>functioning of electricity markets with high shares of renewables, including: <lb/>1. Improved climate and low‐carbon energy policy instruments: an ongoing, long‐term process; <lb/>2. Better electricity market design: a no regret solution; and <lb/>3.

			<body>Page | 62 <lb/>It is possible to define a basic package of policy measures that should be pursued as a priority. <lb/>Specifically, improving climate policies and better energy‐only markets (A, B and C) could bring <lb/>benefits in terms of security of electricity supply. This may solve some of the issues associated <lb/>with increasing shares of variable renewables. While financing peak plants and mid‐merit power <lb/>plants will still need to address the issues associated with cash flow volatility and variability, <lb/>enhanced energy policies and better energy markets can significantly increase investment <lb/>incentives to ensure generation adequacy at least cost. Furthermore, undertaking these measures <lb/>has broader benefits and should therefore be regarded as no regret actions. <lb/>However, implementing the basic package of measures A to C will, at best, take time, and it is also <lb/>possible that governments may fail to implement the appropriate measures. In particular, <lb/>improving the certainty of climate policies for investors may be especially challenging in view of <lb/>the inherent uncertainty associated with climate policies and future technology cost reductions. If <lb/>this is the case, additional measures resulting in further modifications of market arrangements <lb/>should be considered to maintain security of supply. The capacity mechanisms described in D and <lb/>E lead to a significant departure from the market framework described in section 1. They are <lb/>hybrid solutions between energy‐only markets and more heavy‐handed regulation where <lb/>governments contract for all new generation capacity. Nevertheless, such capacity arrangements <lb/>may well be necessary to ensure security of supply during the transition period to cope with some <lb/>regulatory or market failure regarding energy policy uncertainty, the impossibility of preventing <lb/>price restrictions and the lack of certainty of revenues of peak plants and mid merits power <lb/>plants. <lb/>Improving climate and low‐carbon energy policies instruments: <lb/>an ongoing long‐term process <lb/>The main purpose here is not to discuss the overall efficiency of climate and renewable policies. <lb/>Nevertheless, a major risk faced by investors in electricity markets comes from the uncertainties <lb/>associated with climate policies (see chapter 2), in that an unexpectedly rapid deployment of low‐ <lb/>carbon energy would reduce the market of conventional plants. Conversely, a failure to deploy <lb/>low‐carbon energy would be a upside for conventional plants. Policy makers should take this into <lb/>account when designing policies. <lb/>The basic measure is to design low‐carbon policies that provide a more predictable framework for <lb/>reliable electricity supply. This includes the design of climate policies, of carbon markets, and low <lb/>carbon generation policies. <lb/>Definition of energy and climate policies <lb/>Findings <lb/> Stable and predictable climate and low‐carbon policies would have the potential to solve some of <lb/>the problems associated with investment incentives, although technological developments and <lb/>other investment issues are important. Improved climate and low‐carbon policies include <lb/>providing more certainty for carbon prices (or equivalent policies where a carbon price is not yet <lb/>in place); supplementing it by setting targets that are backed with credible policies to ensure <lb/>their delivery; predictable renewables and energy efficiency policies; and avoiding sudden <lb/>reverses in the overall energy strategy. <lb/> Governments should aim to provide more certainty and predictability, while it has to be <lb/>acknowledged that policies will need to be reviewed and modified over time to reflect changing <lb/>economic conditions, policy successes (or failures), and technology developments. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 63 <lb/>Carbon pricing policies <lb/>Uncertainty about global climate policy and regional or national climate policies can deter <lb/>potential investors while they wait for the rules of the game to be more clearly spelled out. <lb/>At the global level, governments can seek to conclude climate negotiations on schedule by 2015 <lb/>as agreed in Durban in 2011, to clarify the global framework and ambitions from 2020 onward. <lb/>While security of electricity supply is not the driver of these global negotiations, negotiators from <lb/>IEA member countries should be aware that failure to reach agreement affects investment in <lb/>electricity markets. <lb/>However, global certainty will not be achieved quickly or easily, and governments face the <lb/>challenge of ensuring that investment continues in the meantime. A stable, long‐term domestic <lb/>policy framework with wide political support helps provide investment certainty, although global <lb/>uncertainties will still cause investors to question the probability of these policies being modified <lb/>in the future. To provide this sort of certainty, the EU has already set targets for 2020 in its <lb/>emissions trading system, and intends to set 2030 targets in the next few years. <lb/>The design of domestic climate policy instruments can build on lessons learned from policies <lb/>already implemented. Emissions trading schemes (ETS) are currently regarded as the most <lb/>politically feasible means of pricing greenhouse gas emissions, aiming at providing appropriate <lb/>incentives for investment in low‐carbon technologies and demand reduction. However, the <lb/>detailed design of these schemes matters, particularly setting the overall cap on emissions at a <lb/>level that requires emissions reductions from participants. Due to the financial crisis, the caps for <lb/>Phase II (2008‐2012) and Phase III (2013‐2020) are now understood to have been set too high. <lb/>Confronted with a carbon price too low to trigger low‐carbon investments, the European Union <lb/>considered setting‐aside EU Allowances and changing the 2020 CO 2 emissions target. On the one <lb/>hand, such actions would be consistent with the decarbonisation objective and one could argue <lb/>that this signals the commitment of Europe to maintaining binding climate policy. But on the <lb/>other hand, this needs to be done in a way that maintains trust in the scheme&apos;s settings and seeks <lb/>to minimise perceptions of political risk; otherwise, it could undermine the long‐term credibility of <lb/>the trading scheme. <lb/>Figure 31 • Illustration of the carbon price support mechanism <lb/>Source: HM Treasury, 2010. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 64 <lb/>Alternative design features to improve investment certainty include carbon price floors, as long as <lb/>these are credible (IEA, 2008a), or even specifying separate emissions targets (and associated <lb/>policy measures) for the electricity sector. In general, economic efficiency and the cost of climate <lb/>policy is minimised by wide sectoral coverage. However, setting a separate emissions target for <lb/>the electricity sector could give a clearer signal to electricity investors, particularly if this is seen as <lb/>a more sustainable policy. There will be a trade‐off between overall economic efficiency and <lb/>investment certainty that will need to be assessed. This takes time, but can restore confidence <lb/>concerning the commitment of the global community to mitigate climate change despite the <lb/>economic turmoil. <lb/>Energy Efficiency Policies <lb/>Reducing energy demand through cost‐effective efficiency gains can be a key element of both <lb/>managing energy demand growth and implementing low‐carbon strategies. However, these gains <lb/>are not always easy to deliver in practice, and they must be continuously monitored and verified. <lb/>Some energy efficiency programmes in the Pacific Northwest, California and New England (such as <lb/>the California initiative) have been very successful in reducing or eliminating the need for new <lb/>supply‐side resources, consistently delivering on targets. However, in other instances <lb/>governments have announced ambitious energy efficiency goals but not backed these up with <lb/>credible policies, institutions, and tracking systems, leading to disappointment. Fortunately, a <lb/>significant evidence base now exists on &quot;what works&quot; in terms of energy efficiency policy design <lb/>and implementation. This is highlighted in the IEA&apos;s 25 Energy Efficiency Recommendations, and <lb/>the &quot;Policy Pathways&quot; series of publications which provide guidance on implementation. 16 <lb/>Technology policies <lb/>Over the past 20 years, several layers of energy policies have been added to facilitate deployment <lb/>of renewable technologies, improve energy efficiency or develop nuclear energy. These policies <lb/>now determine an increasing portion of investment in the electricity sector. <lb/>As pointed out in Summing up the Parts, &quot; the package of energy policies must be regularly <lb/>reviewed and updated to maintain calibration over time &quot; IEA (2011b). However, once introduced, <lb/>project developers become used to them and these policies tend to be difficult to reform, which <lb/>can lead to significant inconsistencies between them. <lb/>These risks can be minimised by getting policies right at the outset. Reforming policies can help <lb/>staying in the comfort zone. Furthermore, well‐designed technology policies must prevent <lb/>possible side‐effects on the electricity market functioning. This includes: <lb/> Defining credible policy targets taking into account the maturity of different technologies and <lb/>uncertainty on learning rates, with sensible objectives and milestones for renewables and <lb/>energy efficiency; <lb/> Provide a predictable and transparent renewable energy policy framework, integrating RE <lb/>policy into an overall energy strategy, taking a portfolio approach by focusing on technologies <lb/>16 <lb/>One particular area that shows significant promise both for delivering efficiency gains cost‐effectively, and <lb/>also delivering them with certainty, is to place obligations for energy efficiency delivery with electricity <lb/>providers such as utilities or retail companies. If these programmes are well designed, they can deliver <lb/>consistent year‐on‐year savings, reducing the need for new supply in a predictable manner. The IEA&apos;s work <lb/>stream entitled Policies for Energy Provider Delivered Energy Efficiency (PEPDEE) is working to coalesce and <lb/>disseminate proven practices in regulation and programme delivery through regional PEPDEE workshop reports <lb/>and PEPDEE case studies. <lb/></body>

The <lb/>example of the United Kingdom shows that reforming low‐carbon support instruments can take <lb/>time. The proposed electricity market reform, which goes through several reforms in parallel, <lb/>mobilizes a lot of resources and staff. <lb/>However, in many countries, it must be acknowledged that reducing the causes of energy policy <lb/>risk and regulatory opportunism will remain a challenge during the transition to a low‐carbon <lb/>economy. Governments should aim to provide more certainty and predictability, while evolutions <lb/>of climate policies may be needed to reflect a rapidly changing new economic environment and <lb/>rapidly declining costs of some low‐carbon generation technologies. <lb/>Design of renewable support instruments <lb/>Findings <lb/>The first support policies for renewable energy were introduced without considering their <lb/>possible impact on the functioning of electricity markets (IEA, 2011b). In the early stage this was <lb/>not an issue, as the share of variable renewable energy was initially very low. But as these policies <lb/>become effective, variable renewables now represent 20% to 30% of the electricity generated in <lb/>some countries and they grow much more rapidly than electricity consumption. Support <lb/>instruments and market frameworks must be designed to be mutually compatible with each other <lb/>during the transition period toward market‐based low‐carbon investments; several simple <lb/>measures would significantly reduce the risks faced by market‐driven investments, without <lb/>necessarily altering the effectiveness of renewable policies. <lb/>These include the following: <lb/> Using predictable instruments to achieve the policy targets, and <lb/> Accurate forecasts of low carbon deployment are essential to be able to evaluate the size of both <lb/>the market for low‐carbon generation and the residual market. Support instruments for low‐ <lb/>carbon generation which include some control over quantitative deployment of capacity provide <lb/>more predictability. <lb/> Efficient participation of renewables in the markets requires adaptation of some renewable <lb/>support instruments. While instruments such as feed‐in tariffs are effective during the inception <lb/>phase, the benefits of market participation increase for high shares of variable renewable <lb/>resources. For an efficient participation, renewables would have to provide a dollar‐per‐MWh bid, <lb/>below which they are no longer willing to generate. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 66 <lb/> For high shares of variable renewable energy sources, avoiding incentives to renewable <lb/>generators that hinder the system integration of renewables, such as fully decoupling <lb/>remuneration from market price signals. For instance, decoupling subsidies from generated <lb/>electricity would create the conditions to move toward participation of renewables on the day‐ <lb/>ahead and balancing energy market. <lb/>Predictability of support instruments for renewables <lb/>Accurate forecasts of renewable deployment are essential to be able to evaluate the size of the <lb/>residual electricity market for non‐renewable generation. Even though the load factor may be <lb/>decreasing over time, investors can anticipate this effect and they can choose the lower cost <lb/>option to serve this declining market. <lb/>Nevertheless, the pace of renewable deployment introduces uncertainty over the load factor for <lb/>conventional power plants (cf. Chapter 4). For instance, feed‐in‐tariffs for solar PV and wind in <lb/>Europe led to an unanticipated increase in installed capacity in 2010 and 2011. <lb/>More predictable renewable policies would reduce the load factor risk. In practice, this means <lb/>preventing the &quot; stop and go &quot; of renewable policies and controlling costs. Auctions or quantity‐ <lb/>based approaches to subsidies can better control the quantity of new capacity (Cramton and <lb/>Ockenfels, 2011). Such adaptations would greatly contribute to mitigating policy risk for owners of <lb/>conventional power plants and also for the renewable industry itself. <lb/>Adapting renewable support instruments to ensure efficient participation in the <lb/>energy, balancing and ancillary services markets <lb/>Wholesale electricity markets are based on marginal cost pricing in order to attain the least cost <lb/>dispatch of installed capacity. Most of the hours, variable renewables with a zero marginal cost <lb/>will be dispatched efficiently. But in case of very high renewable generation and low demand (see <lb/>section above on minimum load balancing), renewable output may have to be curtailed to <lb/>balance supply and demand or for reasons of system security (even if this increases the full <lb/>lifecycle cost of renewable production). <lb/>Wholesale markets are efficient if generators bid their marginal costs on markets, but this may <lb/>not be the case if some generators benefit from out‐of market revenues such as priority dispatch <lb/>and feed‐in tariffs or tradable green certificate revenues. In particular, if TSOs sell renewable <lb/>electricity into the spot market at high, negative prices to guarantee the dispatch of variable <lb/>renewables, inefficient outcomes can occur – as has been the case in Germany, in particular in <lb/>late 2009. <lb/>Instruments such as feed‐in tariffs provide incentives to locate wind and solar capacity in good <lb/>resource locations and to ensure that they are actually generating. This is effective during the <lb/>inception and scale‐up phase (IEA, 2011a) at relatively moderate shares of variable renewables. <lb/>However, as these technologies reach maturity and their installed capacity increases, so do the <lb/>benefits of market participation. <lb/>In order to restore efficient market signals, the participation of variable renewables in the energy <lb/>and reserve markets has to be ensured. Exposing renewable generators to market price signals, <lb/>providing incentives to generate according to the value associated with this generation. In <lb/>practice, this means that renewable generators would have to provide a dollar per MWh bid, <lb/>below which they are no longer willing to generate. <lb/>In that perspective, renewable support instruments might need to be adapted in order to change <lb/>the marginal remuneration scheme when the system is in a state of excess supply. Germany and <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 67 <lb/>the United Kingdom are already considering adaptations of their support mechanisms. Germany <lb/>recently introduced a market premium payment (see Box 4) and the United Kingdom is <lb/>considering the introduction of Contracts for Difference for off‐shore wind farms. <lb/>Designing renewable support instruments compatible with the market participation is an <lb/>emerging topic. However, as the penetration of variable renewables in the system grows, they will <lb/>need to become normal actors in the overall energy markets. <lb/>Box 4 • Market premium payments in Germany <lb/>Allowing renewables to participate to the provision of balancing services <lb/>Variable renewables generation is volatile and its output is less predictable than conventional <lb/>power plants, requiring ramping‐up and down to compensate for variations and imbalances of <lb/>variable generation. <lb/>There is a growing debate concerning the economic interest to expose variable renewables to the <lb/>balancing markets. One the one hand, exposing wind energy sellers to a balancing mechanism <lb/>would reflect the costs and value associated with wind volatility and unpredictability. <lb/>In situations of imbalance, wind or solar generators can provide flexible services by themselves. <lb/>For instance, a wind plant can operate at a fixed level below its available maximum output to <lb/>enable a spinning reserve to be available and &quot; up ramp &quot;  service to be provided. The extent to <lb/>which this will take place will depend on the relative economic merits compared to other options. <lb/>Provided that balancing markets are well designed and in countries where they are integrated <lb/>with the energy market, it is efficient to expose variable renewables to the energy and balancing <lb/>market. <lb/>On the other hand, in some countries balancing mechanisms are not perceived as being efficient or <lb/>enough liquid (Newberry, 2012). In these countries, exposing variable renewables to the balancing <lb/>The optional market premium model was introduced on 1 st January 2012 (Erneuerbare <lb/>Energien Gesetz ‐ EEG). It opened the opportunity for renewable energy generators under the <lb/>FIT scheme to opt for selling electricity directly into the market. This has been applied in <lb/>particular for wind farms. Under the market premium model, a wind farm sells its produced <lb/>output to a third party at the market price rather than selling it to the grid operator at the <lb/>regulated feed‐in‐tariff. <lb/>The reference market price for the calculation of the market premium is determined as the <lb/>monthly technology‐weighted spot price at the EPEX spot energy exchange. The premium is <lb/>then set as the difference in the average wind market price and the feed in tariff level. This <lb/>represents an implicit floor price guarantee for the wind farm at the level of the regulated <lb/>tariff. All wind generators that achieve a higher price on the market have an advantage; all <lb/>who make a below average revenue get less. <lb/>In addition to the market price and the market premium, the wind farm is entitled to receive a <lb/>management premium, intended to cover the administrative costs associated with the direct <lb/>marketing of energy. The management premium is set at 12 EUR/MWh for 2012 and steps <lb/>down gradually to 7 EUR/MWh in 2015, where it was scheduled to will remain. However, a <lb/>reform of the premium is ongoing, as some stakeholders perceive it as being too high. <lb/>More than 15 000 MW of renewable energy have been transferred to new renewable market <lb/>premium scheme in the first months of 2012. <lb/></body>

Possible market design improvements are further investigated in the next section. <lb/>Energy Market Design Improvements: a no‐regret solution <lb/>Findings <lb/>Improvements of energy market design can be implemented easily and at minimal administrative <lb/>costs. Such incremental measures not only improve incentives to ensure generation adequacy, <lb/>but also handle operating challenges of integration of increasing share of variable renewables. <lb/>This includes: <lb/> removing the causes of price restrictions that prevent electricity prices to rise high enough; <lb/> defining and introducing new products (when and where necessary) (i.e. balancing, forward <lb/>energy product for extreme peak conditions….); <lb/> considering the adoption of locational marginal pricing; and <lb/> ensuring an efficient and integrated design of energy, balancing and reserve markets. <lb/>Remove restriction on electricity prices <lb/>In principle, well functioning and non‐distorted electricity prices should ensure prices high enough <lb/>to cover the fixed costs of peaking units during tight supply conditions when reserve margins are <lb/>too low. Figure 32 (below) shows the highest electricity prices in PJM. Even though they can <lb/>exceed 700 USD/MWh during a limited number of hours, these prices may remain too low. <lb/>Departing from this textbook market design is likely to lead to adequacy problems. The <lb/>straightforward way to address the missing money problem is to remove economic price caps <lb/>below the value of lost load and limit out‐of‐market operations. <lb/> <lb/>Removing undue restrictions on peak prices will be important to ensure well‐functioning <lb/>electricity markets. Wholesale peak prices are not intrinsically bad, since in periods of scarcity, <lb/>high prices act to incentivise demand response and peak investments. However, monitoring that <lb/>peak prices are not excessive in periods of relative scarcity will remain a challenge for <lb/>regulators. <lb/> <lb/>Creating an efficient and transparent market platform for flexible services would allow all <lb/>technologies to compete equally. Defining new flexibility products such as ramping up and <lb/>down, fast response ramping, minimum load balancing, etc. would reveal a price for each <lb/>flexibility service. All technologies should be able to participate in these markets, including <lb/>variable renewable and conventional generation, demand response and storage. On this basis, <lb/>forward markets for such services could provide longer‐term signals to invest in the right <lb/>technologies. <lb/> <lb/>Variable renewable resources will have to contribute to the balancing of the system during <lb/>minimum load conditions. Above a certain level, the renewable output must be controlled <lb/>during periods of oversupply in order to ensure secure and reliable system operations. This <lb/>means that, in practice, some wind turbines or solar power plants must either operate below <lb/>their maximum output, as is already the case in Spain, Texas and Ireland. <lb/> <lb/>The locational marginal pricing (LMP) framework could bring increasing benefits as higher <lb/>shares of renewables have to be accommodated. LMP provides an efficient framework to attain <lb/>the least cost dispatch and curtailment decisions in order to reflect the impact of thousands of <lb/>renewable generators on losses and congestion on the network. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 69 <lb/>The causes of restrictions on electricity prices were discussed in chapter 4. One major question is <lb/>whether governments and system operators can address these causes. <lb/>Explicit price caps below the value of lost load could technically be removed and replaced by <lb/>other market power mitigation measures. Indeed, price caps have been introduced in some <lb/>markets (PJM) to address market power issues during scarcity conditions. As these price caps <lb/>have been used as justification for the introduction of complex and costly capacity markets, one <lb/>could legitimately ask whether price caps are the best instrument to mitigate market power. This <lb/>is all the more the case as market power on capacity markets also has to be monitored, meaning <lb/>that price caps only mitigate but do not solve the problem. Other mitigation measures are <lb/>available, including market monitoring during extreme peak prices, structural decisions to <lb/>increase competition where there is local market power, entering into long-term contracts with <lb/>generators facing a local market power or simply expanding the transmission network to increase <lb/>competition. <lb/>The impact on price resulting from the behaviour of system operators could also be addressed. One <lb/>possibility is to prevent out-of-market operations that restrict prices from increasing high enough <lb/>during scarcity hours. This might be difficult to implement in practice because as system operators <lb/>would be considered liable for not taking action in case of blackout, they usually prefer the certainty <lb/>associated with bilateral contracts. Another (more realistic) possibility would then consist of setting <lb/>the electricity price to the value of the lost load each time the system operator relies on out-of-<lb/>market operations, such as voltage reduction, to maintain reserve margin in real time. <lb/>A trickier problem is the risk of political intervention when prices are peaking. In some countries, <lb/>high prices raise political acceptability issues and, based on experience, generators may anticipate <lb/>that governments will intervene. In other sectors, nobody hears or cares about the price of <lb/>intermediate goods being very high, as these prices have a negligible impact on their average cost. <lb/>Financial markets such as call options can help manage exposure of markets players to this <lb/>volatility. But sometimes peak power prices do make the headlines and public opinion is sensitive <lb/>to such events. Even in the absence of explicit price caps, just the threat of government <lb/>intervention may have the effect of discouraging investment. Unless governments are credible in <lb/>their commitment not to restrict prices, this can lead to expected missing money. And, as <lb/>discussed later, this issue becomes even more challenging as the share of variable renewables <lb/>increases. <lb/>Figure 32 • Price duration curve for PJM real-time market during hours above the 95 th percentile, 2006-2010 <lb/>Source: Monitoring Analytics (2011). <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 70 <lb/>Electricity product definition <lb/>While a megawatt‐hour of electricity is often considered as a commodity, this does not capture <lb/>the essential features of the product. Actually, electricity is an extremely differentiated product. <lb/>Electricity available in hour h and location i is not substitutable with electricity in hour h&apos; and <lb/>location i&apos; and should therefore be considered as two distinct products and markets. Furthermore, <lb/>the sub‐hourly variations of power over several consecutive time intervals also matters. <lb/>Maintaining a supply and demand balance in real time requires satisfying both technical <lb/>constraints and the economic capability to increase or reduce generation or load at different time <lb/>horizons (i.e. instantaneously, within 15 minutes, one hour, several hours or days), at different <lb/>speeds (ramp rates). <lb/>As the features of electricity systems change with increasing shares of renewables, so should the <lb/>definition of electricity markets where substitutable products are traded. Introducing new <lb/>products or services or even changing the definition of existing ones may be required. Such <lb/>products would represent an opportunity to further develop ancillary services markets. <lb/>Indeed, as electricity markets developed, a set of power markets was created to put together <lb/>similar electricity products and reflect the features of electricity systems. Forward and day‐ahead <lb/>energy markets, by far the largest one, intra‐day, balancing and reserve markets (primary and <lb/>secondary) followed. Some countries have distinct markets for technical constraints (voltage <lb/>control and congestion management) while others co‐optimise dispatching and balancing <lb/>services. Some countries have developed sophisticated locational marginal pricing of electricity <lb/>for thousands of different nodes of a network, while others try to have uniform electricity tariffs <lb/>over a large geographic area. <lb/>Call options (reliability options) <lb/>A reliability option (RO) is a call option that is both physical and financial. A generator that sells a <lb/>reliability option must pay the system operator the difference between the spot price and the <lb/>strike price whenever the spot price exceeds the strike price. <lb/>It is physical, in that it is associated with a specific plant that will be penalised if it is not available <lb/>when the option is called (i.e. when the spot price exceeds the option&apos;s strike price). The RO is <lb/>called when the spot price exceeds the strike price. The strike price can be set at a price that is <lb/>slightly higher than the marginal cost of the most expensive unit on the system. (Cramton and <lb/>Stoft, 2005). <lb/>These options can smooth revenues of peak plants over time and could also be used to hedge <lb/>market players exposed to peak prices. Some proposals have been made to create options for <lb/>balancing resources (Pöyry, 2011b). Another possibility is that these options could be procured by <lb/>system operators. In that case the outcome is similar to capacity markets discussed later. In any <lb/>case, such option products require well‐functioning energy markets, in particular, that electricity <lb/>prices can be high enough during scarcity conditions. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 71 <lb/>Figure 33 • Example of a reliability contract <lb/>Source: DECC, 2011. <lb/>Definition of flexible products <lb/>In some jurisdictions, there is no market platform for some specific products needed by the <lb/>system operator in the short run. This may be the case for products to solve network congestion <lb/>(counter trading), products to ramp‐up or ramp‐down capacity to follow demand and renewable <lb/>output variations, or products for voltage control during certain hours. Some countries such as <lb/>Spain are considering the creation of new short‐term, flexible products markets, using existing <lb/>electronic market platforms as the tertiary reserves market. <lb/>In the absence of such markets, system operators tend to rely on bilateral contracts with specific <lb/>power plants that have the technical capability to supply the specific service. However, the <lb/>financial settlement of these operations often lacks transparency. Defining open market platforms <lb/>for new products would contribute to increasing the revenues of flexibility services. Such markets <lb/>should be opened to power plants or demand response. They can provide a price signal to decide <lb/>to mothball an old power plant, to invest in demand response capabilities or a new flexible plant. <lb/>One caveat must be mentioned here: as products are defined more precisely, market liquidity and <lb/>market power quickly become issues. Cutting the definition of flexibility products into too many <lb/>small slices could reduce too much liquidity. Therefore, the number of products may have to <lb/>remain limited. In addition, system operators are often the natural counterparty of such flexibility <lb/>products and are the only ones that can create a forward demand curve. <lb/>Market Price <lb/>Strike Price <lb/>GBP 1000 / MWh <lb/>Paid by <lb/>generators to <lb/>holder of the option <lb/>Time <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 72 <lb/>Box 5 • ISO New England Forward Reserve Market <lb/>The ISO-NE determines locational reserve requirements for three ISO-NE zones (import-<lb/>constrained) for each of the three following operating reserve products: <lb/>Function <lb/>Product <lb/>Characteristics <lb/>Primary frequency <lb/>control response <lb/>No market <lb/>Secondary Frequency <lb/>control response: <lb/>Regulation Reserve <lb/>Nominated capacity must be delivered in less than five minutes, a <lb/>minimum ramp rate of one MW/min and output must be maintained <lb/>during a minimum duration of sixty minutes. <lb/>Tertiary Frequency <lb/>control response: <lb/>Ten-Minute <lb/>Spinning <lb/>Nominated capacity must be delivered in less than ten minutes and <lb/>output must be maintained during a minimum duration of sixty <lb/>minutes. <lb/>Ten-Minute non-<lb/>spinning <lb/>Nominated capacity must be synchronized at nominated capacity in <lb/>less than ten minutes and output must be maintained during a <lb/>minimum duration of sixty minutes. <lb/>Thirty Minute <lb/>Operating <lb/>Nominated capacity must be synchronized at nominated capacity in <lb/>less than thirty minutes. <lb/>Twice a year, the ISO-NE manages a Forward Reserve Market.

Defined very generally, LMP consists of centrally-computed electricity hourly prices, <lb/>set node by node (there are several thousands in PJM) that reflect the marginal cost of producing <lb/>and consuming electricity at each node of the network. A considerable literature lauds the merits <lb/>of LMP currently being applied in the North West of the United States. This centralised approach <lb/>factors in generation costs, losses and network constraints, so as to yield to the optimal dispatch <lb/>of existing assets in a transparent way. <lb/>Currently limited to the United States and New-Zealand, many economists in other OECD <lb/>countries advocate nodal pricing. In Europe, nodal pricing would reduce the generation cost by <lb/>1.1% to 3.6% (Neuhoff et al, 2011). PJM estimates the overall benefits of integrated operation of <lb/>their system are USD 2.2 billion (approximately EUR 1.8 billion) annually (Ott, 2010, quoted by <lb/>Neuhoff et al, 2011). <lb/>However, applying nodal pricing across multiple jurisdictions may be a complex and lengthy <lb/>process. For the time being, market coupling in Europe is a much simpler procedure. Similar zonal <lb/>pricing approach can also be found in Australia (NEM), in some U.S. RTOs and in Nordpool. It <lb/>captures some of the benefits of LMP with a simpler definition based on the observation that <lb/>most network congestion in Europe occurs mainly at the borders between different system <lb/>operators&apos; areas. <lb/>Looking forward, increasing shares of variable renewables located far from consumption centres <lb/>may lead to new grid congestions and increase transmission losses, in particular if network <lb/>investments lag behind renewable energy deployment. With higher shares of renewables, nodal <lb/>pricing could bring more cost savings. Indeed, nodal pricing allows differentiating the value of <lb/>different wind farms according to their impact on network congestion of network losses. LMP can <lb/>also provide locational signals for investment in new renewable generation. In addition, in case of <lb/>excess supply, LMP would lead to curtail first wind turbines located in nodes at the origin of <lb/>congestion or higher network losses. <lb/>Figure 34 • Average nodal prices, real time, Q3 2005 (ISO New England) <lb/>Source: ISO NE. <lb/>132 $/MWh <lb/>90 $/MWh <lb/>72 $/MWh <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 74 <lb/>Consistent and integrated day‐ahead, intra‐day, balancing and reserve <lb/>markets <lb/>The juxtaposition of several electricity markets (forward, day‐ahead, intra‐day, balancing and <lb/>reserve markets) reflects the complexity of system operations and of the engineering procedures <lb/>to ensure the balance of generation and load in real time. This organization reflects practical <lb/>computational restrictions with electrical grid management systems in the 90s. But this also <lb/>induces some complexity for market participants having to decide to allocate and sell their output <lb/>on these markets. Well designed and coordinated markets are essential to achieving efficient <lb/>operations of the existing assets. <lb/>Progress has been made in the United States and Australia to integrate balancing and energy <lb/>markets (Australia). This reduces complexity for market participants but usually require greater <lb/>centralization of system operations which could limit its geographical scope. <lb/>In European countries, balancing markets are separate from energy markets. They are also <lb/>asymmetric, penalizing market participants that increase system imbalances. Such asymmetries <lb/>introduce distortions between balancing prices and energy prices. In the perspective of increased <lb/>participation of renewables in the balancing markets, this would penalize renewable operators, <lb/>who are less able to accurately predict their output before real time (for a more detailed <lb/>description, see Newberry, 2012). With this kind of balancing market, market participants prefer <lb/>to have gate closure closer to real time in order to adjust their generation plans and reduce their <lb/>exposure to the imbalance risk. Moreover, regional integration of balancing markets and even <lb/>other reserve markets over wider geographical areas could yield efficiency gains. <lb/>Standards and Procedures: a valuable contribution <lb/>Finding <lb/>Technical standard and procedures will continue to play a role to ensure electricity security. Even <lb/>where operations and investment decisions are market‐based, governments and system <lb/>operators will continue to define, in one way or another, the reliability criteria, some dispatching <lb/>capabilities and requirements for new generation capacity and electrical appliances connected to <lb/>the grid. <lb/>Two items have implications for electricity security in the context of decarbonisation: the <lb/>definition of the reliability criteria and the technical standards for system resources. <lb/>Reliability criteria <lb/>Owing to the technical restrictions that constrain the possibility to price reliability according to the <lb/>willingness to pay of different categories of consumers, governments will continue to have a role to <lb/>play in setting the reliability standards. In theory, the criteria defined is the value of lost load (voll), <lb/>with values in the range of 10 000 to 25 000 USD/MWh, and determines the cost of the last unit that <lb/>must be built to meet peak demand. In practice, governments take a decision on the security of <lb/>supply, in terms of acceptable unserved energy, corresponding to a reliability of c. 99.95%. <lb/> Governments also contribute to ensuring security of electricity supply by issuing standards and <lb/>bringing transparency to the market. This includes the definition of reliability standards; the <lb/>publication of adequacy projections or the definition of technical requirements, such as flexibility of <lb/>power plants, controllability of wind and solar power plants or controllability of electrical <lb/>appliances. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 75 <lb/>Adequacy forecasts <lb/>Another important procedure at the disposal of governments is to periodically publish adequacy <lb/>forecasts, projecting the supply/demand balance and forecasted reserve margins during peak <lb/>hours. Legislation mandating such projections is already in place in most OECD member countries. <lb/>This simple tool brings transparency on market forecasts and also helps inform market‐based <lb/>investment decision making. Such adequacy forecasts remain subject to macroeconomic <lb/>uncertainty but are becoming even more important in the context of uncertainty over renewable <lb/>policies. <lb/>Technical flexibility and controllability requirements <lb/>Technical requirements can ensure that new‐build or existing plants are flexible enough. Usually, <lb/>these tend to be defined by the industry. For instance, in the EUR (European Utilities <lb/>Requirements), the nuclear industry and utilities defined specifications in terms of flexibility for <lb/>nuclear reactors (Pouret, and Nuttall, 2009). But governments can also play a role in promoting <lb/>specifications that reinforce future system flexibility, in consultation with technical bodies. <lb/>Renewable plants should be equipped with devices to control their output in real time. In <lb/>particular, decentralised solar PV plants should also technically be able to contribute to system <lb/>stability, e.g. via dynamic control of active and reactive power output. This is particularly <lb/>important for decentralized PV in order to maintain the voltage level in the local network. As <lb/>already the case in many jurisdictions, technical norms published under the responsibility of <lb/>governments could mandate this to all newly created facilities. This is a key requirement for the <lb/>secure integration of increasing shares of renewables. <lb/>These technical specifications are contained in grid codes which define the parameters that a <lb/>facility connected to a public electric network has to meet to ensure safe, secure and proper <lb/>economic functioning of the electric system. The &quot; facility &quot; can be a generating plant, a consumer, <lb/>or another network. The grid code is specified by an authority responsible for the system integrity <lb/>and network operation.

			<body>Page | 76 <lb/>However, some reforms may be difficult to implement successfully and may take time. This is the <lb/>case, for example, of stable renewable policies and of building credibility of governments to let <lb/>electricity prices rise high enough during periods of scarcity. In addition, even if implemented <lb/>successfully, they have only an indirect effect on incentives to maintain or build adequate capacity <lb/>to meet demand, and there is no absolute certainty that they will be effective in ensuring the <lb/>right level of security of electricity supply in all circumstances. Furthermore, they may not address <lb/>all the investment issues. In particular, variability and volatility of revenues for peak power plants, <lb/>the load factor risk and peak prices may remain a concern. <lb/>The practical considerations also matter, and implementing the measures of the basic package <lb/>takes time--several years --a lead time not compatible with urgent security of supply concerns. In <lb/>this respect, IEA countries face different situations. Most states have already developed or <lb/>improved energy markets and will continue to do so. While some regions face urgent generation <lb/>adequacy constraints (the United Kingdom and Japan, for instance), most of other countries have <lb/>enough excess-capacity, as a result of sluggish demand growth. In the latter case, reforming <lb/>electricity market design is not seen as a pressing concern. <lb/>Targeted reliability contracts consist in signing a (generally multi-annual) -contract with few <lb/>power plants or consumers, to maintain reserve margins or network stability and reliability. This <lb/>includes measures such as strategic reserves, contracts to relieve congestion or maintain voltage <lb/>stability in certain zones. <lb/>Targeted reliability contracts are easy and quick to implement. This feature is a major advantage <lb/>in case of urgent concern over security of electricity supply. In addition, it is fairly easy to stop to <lb/>sign new contracts once the policy and regulatory uncertainty have been reduced and market <lb/>design improved. Thus, targeted contracts ensure security of supply without jeopardizing the <lb/>objective to achieve the economic benefits of well-functioning energy only markets in the longer <lb/>run. <lb/>Several sub-options can be distinguished, based on the nature of the service or asset contracted: <lb/>• A contract with existing assets to prevent mothballing and handle transmission constraints; <lb/> • A contract to trigger investments in new power plants; and <lb/> • Contracts to develop demand response or other innovative solutions.<lb/>Contract to prevent mothballing and handle transmission constraints <lb/>System operators often enter into bilateral contracts with specific power plants to solve network <lb/>constraints or maintain network reliability. The advantages of such targeted contracts are their <lb/>rapidity and simplicity, and that they can be transitory. In markets without locational signals but <lb/>facing recurrent congestion or a voltage stability problem, system operators usually force the <lb/>operation of plants, even when their cost is higher. In general, such actions are necessary with <lb/>older plants that are less efficient. <lb/>A similar contracting approach to keep ageing plants from being mothballed has recently been <lb/>used in several European countries: <lb/>• In 2003, authorities in Sweden and Finland asked their TSOs to procure &quot; strategic reserves &quot; , to <lb/>be activated in times of scarcity. This measure was motivated mainly to meet the need for <lb/>peak capacity during periods of drought, when the capacity of hydro would be reduced by <lb/>40-50% and by the perceived failure of the energy-only market to deliver enough capacity. <lb/> • In 2012, the regulator in Germany approved a contract to maintain gas capacity in southern <lb/>Germany after the shutdown of 8 GW of nuclear power plants. <lb/> • In Denmark and Spain, the TSOs have contracted with thermal power plants needed to <lb/>maintain voltage stability during periods of low load and high renewable generation.<lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 77 <lb/>In the United States, a federal regulation entitles system operators to sign so called Reliability <lb/>must-run contracts (RMR) with units required to meet reliability criteria in constrained areas. <lb/>These multi-year contracts are based on cost-of service agreement and have been used to <lb/>maintain existing capacity on line in all US zones, including liberalised markets such as PJM and <lb/>New England. <lb/>In markets where a locational marginal pricing framework is applied, bilateral contracts can also <lb/>be signed to mitigate the locational market power issues when only one or two power plants can <lb/>relieve congestion or supply reactive power. However, to handle a network constraint, there may <lb/>be a lack of competition to provide these as only a few power plants are typically located in the <lb/>right place. Regulators should therefore keep in mind that targeted contracting can be subject to <lb/>lobbying or gaming. Generators may threaten to mothball a plant in order to extract some <lb/>additional revenues and increase the profitability of their assets. As regulators and system <lb/>operators tend to adopt a conservative approach towards electricity security, they prefer to keep <lb/>power plants online to avoid being blamed in case of capacity shortage or a network problem. <lb/>Maintaining effective System Operators incentives and transparency remains therefore important <lb/>in this context. <lb/>The main drawback of targeted mechanisms is that they introduce market distortions. In <lb/>particular, if the strategic reserve is bidding too low prices on the power market, this can result in <lb/>depressing prices and discouraging investments in new peaking plants. In addition, as pointed out <lb/>by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC 2011, p. 36), &quot; …strategic reserve runs <lb/>the risk of plants not selected choosing to close down if they do not receive a Strategic Reserve <lb/>contract. If this happens this could lead to the &apos;slippery slope&apos; effect, whereby more and more <lb/>plants must form part of the Reserve to ensure it remains effective. &quot; <lb/>Box 6 • The strategic reserve in Sweden and Finland <lb/>Sweden and Finland depend on hydro availability and after significant shortage in 2002/2003, the <lb/>authorities decided that their TSOs should procure a peak load reserve that is activated in times of scarcity. <lb/>Under the Act (2003:436) on peak load reserve, the Swedish TSO Svenska Kraftnät has the responsibility to <lb/>ensure that up to 2 000 MW is available during the winter period (compared to an historic peak load of 27 <lb/>000 MW). An Ordinance states the amount to be procured every winter (1750 MW for the period 16 <lb/>March 2011 to 15 March 2013. Plants need to be able to be activated within 12 hours in Finland and 16 <lb/>hours in Sweden. The Finnish TSO Fingrid procures up to 600 MW (compared to an historic peak load of 15 <lb/>000 MW). <lb/>In Finland, Fingrid organised auctions to contract short lead time, indicating that the intention of the <lb/>mechanism is to prevent existing plants from mothballing or decommissioning. Finland has old heavy oil <lb/>and coal plants. In 2009 and 2010, provision costs amounted to 22 500 EUR/MW/yr and 2 500 <lb/>EUR/MW/yr, respectively. Four plants participated in the May 2011 auction and three were selected. <lb/>In Sweden, the peak load reserve is procured annually and is composed of generation capacity and <lb/>demand reduction capacity. The share of demand reduction capacity will increase from 25% in 2012 to <lb/>100% for the period 2017-2020. By 2020, the peak load reserve is to be completely phased out. <lb/>In Sweden, reserves can be activated on Nord Pool Elspot, if there is not enough capacity to clear the <lb/>market, at a price equals to the last commercial bid plus 0.1 EUR/MWh (with a maximum price of 2 000 <lb/>EUR/MWh). However this rarely happens (On December 17, 2009, the Swedish and Finnish peak load <lb/>reserves were activated on Elspot). Usually, Svenska Kraftnät activates the strategic reserve after the <lb/>closing of Elspot. In that case, the minimum price is specified in the contract. Svenska Kraftnät activated <lb/>the reserves during 30 days during winter 2009/2010, and during 8 days during winter 2010/2011. <lb/>Source: Svenska Kraftnät Frontier Economics (2011). <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 78 <lb/>Contracts to bring in new investment in power plants <lb/>Another possibility to ensure generation adequacy consists in organising tenders to build new <lb/>power plants. This is a straightforward, quick and effective means to bring in new capacity when <lb/>supply adequacy forecasts show a lack of capacity a few years in advance and if old plants have to <lb/>be closed. <lb/>In France in 2000, the legislature passed a measure which would permit organisation of a call for <lb/>tenders to ensure adequate capacity or network constraints. This mechanism has been used to <lb/>build a CCGT power plant in France in Brittany. Likewise, in Norway, the network operator also <lb/>built and owns a gas‐fired power plant to feed oil rigs in case of a dry year. <lb/>This approach clearly substitutes for the market. With strategic reserves, the government or the <lb/>system operator, not the market participants, decides the type of capacity and chooses the <lb/>technology and the timing of investments. There is a room for competition, but it is limited to the <lb/>selection of the least cost provider of the capacity considered necessary. <lb/>Contracts to develop demand response <lb/>In order to correct the market failure associated with inelastic electricity demand, governments <lb/>may wish to promote demand response. Large industrial customers are already able to reduce <lb/>load. This potential can be increased but may remain limited. Moreover, demand response has to <lb/>compete with peaking plants whose annual fixed cost is low, in c. 100 USD/kW/year and the <lb/>availability of demand response potential is not guaranteed, unlike conventional generation. The <lb/>economic case for large‐scale deployment of demand response capability still must be made. This <lb/>is the case in particular for small consumers for which savings on their electricity bill may be very <lb/>low. <lb/>Targeted contracting can accelerate the deployment of demand response and reinforce the <lb/>business model of smart grids. However, a centralised definition of the specifications of the <lb/>service may be a barrier to the development of other innovative demand‐side solutions. As these <lb/>demand side solutions reach a sufficient degree of maturity and as the automation and remote <lb/>control of electrical appliances develops, they will become competitive with other sources of <lb/>capacity. <lb/>Market‐wide capacity mechanism: a safety net <lb/>Findings <lb/> Capacity markets can be effective to ensure adequate capacity and they can be used to promote <lb/>flexibility, investment in capacity and, in particular, demand response. <lb/> Capacity markets have the advantage to encourage competition between different technologies <lb/>on a level playing field. <lb/> However, capacity markets tend to have high transaction costs and put a burden on regulatory <lb/>institutions. <lb/> They might have unintended consequences in creating secondary incentives and, depending on <lb/>their design, may create excess capacity and lower demand response during scarcity conditions. <lb/> National capacity markets have a potential to introduce distortions between different countries or <lb/>jurisdictions of a single electricity market. Before introducing capacity mechanisms, governments <lb/>should consider their impact on incentives and define common rules on a market‐wide basis. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 79 <lb/>Unlike targeted reliability contracting, capacity markets should be viewed as a likely permanent <lb/>instrument. They are quite heavy‐handed administrative interventions which may ultimately lead <lb/>to re‐regulating many parameters of electricity markets. Their introduction can be motivated by a <lb/>lack of trust in energy‐only markets or poorly designed electricity markets. However, capacity <lb/>markets involve very technical discussions, still ongoing, about the incentives and their expected <lb/>effects. <lb/>Our analysis suggests three reasons why governments may lose faith in the ability of energy‐only <lb/>markets to acquire enough investment to ensure security of electricity supply. <lb/>1. Price restrictions or regulatory opportunism: governments anticipate that they will not let <lb/>electricity prices go high enough during periods of scarcity. <lb/>2. Climate and technology policy risk: governments give priority to climate and renewable <lb/>policies which are not well‐integrated with well functioning electricity markets. They may <lb/>continue to define ambitious policy targets but lack certainty and to use renewable policies to <lb/>pursue multiple objectives. <lb/>3. Revenue variability and volatility: given the current financial context, increasing yearly <lb/>variability of revenues negatively impacts the availability and the cost of capital. This reflects <lb/>concerns about liquidity of financial markets to hedge such risks and little appetite of financial <lb/>counterparties for it. This is a particular concern as peaking units are increasingly needed with <lb/>the development of renewables. <lb/>A market‐wide capacity mechanism can be broadly defined as a regulatory instrument designed to <lb/>create revenues for all capacity − generation or demand response − available during a specified <lb/>period, generally when system operations are tight. These capacity mechanisms complement <lb/>revenues from the sale of electricity, in order to assure that enough capacity is available to meet <lb/>peak demand in restructured electricity systems. This is especially the case for fixed cost recovery <lb/>of peak capacity rarely used and facing unduly capped prices. <lb/>As market‐wide arrangements remunerate all capacity, this prevents negative bias that could <lb/>appear with targeted mechanisms. No technology is favoured by the mechanism; this leads, in <lb/>theory, to an efficient – least cost – portfolio of technologies. <lb/>There are several classes of capacity mechanisms: regulators can choose to set prices (capacity <lb/>payments) or quantities (capacity markets), the time‐horizon can be annual or several years in <lb/>advance (forward capacity markets), capacity‐obligations can be assigned on suppliers <lb/>(decentralised capacity mechanism) or system operators can organise tenders (centralized <lb/>capacity mechanism). This section briefly describes the main dimensions of market‐wide capacity <lb/>mechanisms. <lb/>Capacity payments 17 <lb/>In price‐based capacity mechanisms, a central institution sets the price for capacity. Such capacity <lb/>payments are supposed to compensate for the shortfall of revenues for all the capacity resulting <lb/>from price restrictions. The capacity payment is supposed to determine the capacity provided, <lb/>which is an outcome of the market. <lb/>Take a simple example. Assuming for simplicity that prices never exceed the short‐run, marginal <lb/>cost of peaking units, these plants never cover their fixed costs. The missing money is equal to the <lb/>capital cost annuity for an efficient peaking unit, usually in the range of <lb/>50‐100 000 USD/MW/year. These payments should be made for all capacity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 80 <lb/>The payments used in Spain are one example of such capacity payments (see Box 7). <lb/>It has been argued that in practice, capacity payments can be motivated in order to increase <lb/>profitability of power plants and compensate generators for the reduction of load factors <lb/>resulting from rapid deployment of renewables. However, it is important to keep in mind that the <lb/>objective of such mechanisms is not to increase the profitability of existing assets hit by the <lb/>economic crisis, but rather to provide certainty that there will be enough capacity available. <lb/>Box 7 • Capacity payments in Spain <lb/>Capacity markets <lb/>A capacity market is a market designed by policy makers and regulators to meet capacity needs as <lb/>defined by regulators. Unlike energy-only markets, it is a central body that defines which level of <lb/>capacity is adequate and explicitly sets the quantity for reserve margin or capacity obligation. This <lb/>constitutes a higher degree of regulatory intervention. The price determination and the choice of <lb/>the type of capacity (demand response, old power plants or new investments) are left to the <lb/>market. <lb/>So-called Reliability Options are similar to financial call-options to buy power at a predefined <lb/>strike price when the spot market price is above the strike price (Cramton and Ockenfels, 2011). <lb/>Such options hedge consumers and generators.

It <lb/>acts as a &quot; long-term investment incentive &quot; consisting of a payment for ten years, restricted to new <lb/>plants with a capacity above 50 MW (existing plants are eligible in case of significant refurbishment <lb/>investment). <lb/>The incentive payment is computed as a function of the reserve margin when the plant starts <lb/>operations. The charge is capped to 28 000 EUR/MW/yr for a reserve margin index of 1.1 and <lb/>declines to 0 EUR/MW/yr for a reserve margin index equal to 1.29. <lb/>Source: Frontier Economics (2011). <lb/>0 <lb/>5 000 <lb/>10 000 <lb/>15 000 <lb/>20 000 <lb/>25 000 <lb/>30 000 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 . 1 <lb/>1 . 2 <lb/>1 . 3 <lb/>1 . 4 <lb/>€/kW/y <lb/>Reserve margin index <lb/>Figure 35 Capacity payment (EUR/MW/yr) as a function of reserve margin index in Spain <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 81 <lb/>Our understanding is that these reliability options are similar to capacity markets except that they <lb/>are financial and physical. They have been presented above as a financial product derived from <lb/>energy-only markets on account of the fact that they must be based on well-functioning energy <lb/>markets during scarcity conditions. <lb/>Table 5 summarizes the different capacity markets according to two dimensions.

It has been <lb/>argued that this presents the advantage of allowing new entrants to bid, making the market more <lb/>contestable. <lb/>Geographical scope of capacity markets <lb/>Electricity markets are interconnected and increasingly integrated in some regions. During periods <lb/>of scarcity in one country or market, interconnections play a key role in ensuring system <lb/>adequacy. Available capacity in a zone contributes to meeting peak demand in the other zone. <lb/>Introducing a capacity mechanism in a jurisdiction representing only one zone of an electricity <lb/>market raises many questions. First, the contribution of other zones via the interconnection <lb/>capacity has to be quantified by the system operator when defining the capacity requirement for <lb/>the jurisdiction. Second, this contribution of interconnection can be remunerated or not, and if it <lb/>is remunerated, this can be done to the owner of the transmission rights or to the generating <lb/>capacity on the other side of the interconnection. Third, the implications of different mechanisms <lb/>on the effectiveness in terms of generation adequacy and possible gaming of the capacity markets <lb/>must be carefully analysed. For instance, a capacity market limited to one jurisdiction may lead to <lb/>overinvestment in generation capacity if the contribution of interconnection is underestimated by <lb/>conservative system operators. <lb/>Finally, the competitive effects must be carefully analysed. A single capacity market may <lb/>introduce a distortion of competition within a single market. In Europe, there are some concerns <lb/>that national capacity markets could attract investment in countries introducing them, distort <lb/>competition and create a new barrier for regional market integration. There are also concerns <lb/>about the treatment of interconnections and the lack of regional coordination regarding supply <lb/>adequacy. <lb/>Where capacity markets are implemented, the treatment of interconnections will remain a key <lb/>issue. For regions well interconnected and with coupled electricity prices, the target model should <lb/>include a common definition of capacity credits and the possibility to exchange these credits with <lb/>a proper treatment of network constraints. <lb/>Other dimensions <lb/>Designing the details of capacity markets necessitates solving many other technical questions. <lb/> Interaction with peak prices: a capacity market ensures that there is always more than enough <lb/>capacity and this tends to prevent episodes where market conditions are tight, thus reducing <lb/>peak prices. This may reduce incentives to save energy or engage demand response actions <lb/>during these hours, unless they can participate in the capacity market, which might not be <lb/>possible for small players because of transaction costs. <lb/> Local capacity markets: some small zones of the grid remain poorly interconnected and <lb/>ensuring adequacy in these zones requires setting up local capacity markets. If a limited <lb/>number of competing generating units are sufficient to serve it, market power can be an issue. <lb/> Complexity and governance: it is often mentioned that capacity markets tend to be complex <lb/>and costly. Indeed, the experience of PJM, where a new capacity market was introduced in <lb/>1997 to fix several problems, shows that fine‐tuning capacity markets is a difficult and lengthy <lb/>process. <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 84 <lb/>Flexible capacity markets <lb/>It has been proposed that capacity markets can also play a role in ensuring that sufficient <lb/>flexibility services will be available to accommodate increasing shares of variable renewables. <lb/>Based on the experience of some existing capacity markets, there is a concern that the power <lb/>plants triggered by capacity markets may not flexible enough. This could lead to restrict the <lb/>dispatch of variable renewables in the future or require further investments to upgrade plants. <lb/>Indeed, adding flexibility features to the definition of capacity obligation can contribute to <lb/>ensuring that the ramp‐up or minimum load requirements will be met. <lb/>However, restricting capacity markets to flexible products would not solve the generation <lb/>adequacy issue, as all the capacity would not be factored in. In practice, flexible capacity markets <lb/>would thus lead the regulator to define quantitative flexibility forward objectives in terms of <lb/>ramp‐up, ramp‐down or minimum load. This would go a step further than the definition of <lb/>flexibility products already discussed before and would constitute an additional market <lb/>intervention. <lb/>Our study suggests that the opportunity of such flexible capacity markets needs further <lb/>examination for several reasons. Indeed, the ramp‐up capacity of conventional power plants is <lb/>not a major concern until 2020 in most countries. Gas‐fired power is the technology of choice for <lb/>new investments and the recent CCGTs are flexible. As a result, flexibility can be seen as a by‐ <lb/>product of adequacy, since generation capacity that will be built primarily to ensure adequacy is <lb/>also flexible. <lb/>Minimum load balancing may be a more important operating challenge, as this leads to curtail <lb/>renewable during hours of low load and high renewable generation. However, provided that <lb/>renewable generation is controllable, this is not an issue for the security of electricity supply. <lb/>While the value of lost load is extremely high in case of a generation adequacy problem (10 000 to <lb/>20 000 USD/MWh), the cost of lost renewable generation remains low (50 to 200 USD/MWh). <lb/>This suggests that regulators could continue to be concerned with supply adequacy more than <lb/>with flexibility. As discussed previously, creating a market platform for flexibility could be <lb/>sufficient in order to bring together solutions such as flexibility from nuclear or coal plants, <lb/>pumped storage, demand‐side positive response (water heating) and curtailment of variable <lb/>generation, as well as other technical solutions in order to develop least cost flexibility solutions. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 85 <lb/>Annex: Evaluating the policy options <lb/>Policy makers in several member countries are considering new measures to address security of <lb/>electricity supply. There are many options and liberalisation is still a work in progress. Choosing <lb/>the most promising measures and prioritising regulatory efforts will be a key challenge during the <lb/>transition to a low‐carbon economy. <lb/>The evaluation framework proposed here has been designed to help governments to select the <lb/>options that best fit their specific situations. While pure economic analysis would probably lead to <lb/>prescribing an ideal solution, the approach adopted here aims to reflect real life circumstances <lb/>and to identify situations under which one option might be preferable. <lb/>The following criteria are proposed to help evaluate the range of measures: <lb/>1. Proportionality: Does the scope and form of the regulatory intervention match what is <lb/>necessary to tackle the issue, given its social cost? <lb/>2. Effectiveness: Will the implemented option be effective in ensuring adequate security of supply? <lb/>3. Lead time: Is the duration necessary to set‐up a regulation compatible with the potential <lb/>electricity security of supply problem? <lb/>4. Simplicity: Has the incremental evolution of existing tools been taken into consideration in <lb/>order to avoid unnecessarily complex market design? <lb/>5. Direct costs: What information and authority would a regulator need in order to set the <lb/>capacity requirement and what would be the direct costs? <lb/>6. Indirect costs: What are the potential unintended effects, market distortion and resulting <lb/>dynamic costs? <lb/>7. Adaptability: Can the arrangement be easily harmonised with neighbouring markets in order <lb/>to prevent distortion of competition? Can it be easily abandoned when it no longer needed? <lb/>The qualitative evaluation framework has been applied to assess the strength and weaknesses of <lb/>the different options. The results of this analysis are summarised in the figure below, followed by <lb/>a detailed description of each criterion and the analysis of the options. <lb/>Figure 38 • Qualitative assessment of different policy options to ensure security of electricity supply <lb/>during the transition <lb/>A <lb/>Improved <lb/>climate and <lb/>low carbon <lb/>policies <lb/>B <lb/>Better <lb/>energy <lb/>markets <lb/>E <lb/>Market‐wide <lb/>capacity <lb/>mechanism <lb/>D <lb/>Targeted <lb/>contracting <lb/>C <lb/>Standard &amp; <lb/>procedures <lb/>Proportionate <lb/>Lead time <lb/>Effectiveness <lb/>Direct costs <lb/>Indirect costs <lb/>Poor <lb/>Simplicity <lb/>Adaptability <lb/>Weak <lb/>Average <lb/>Good <lb/>Excellent <lb/>Legend: <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 86 <lb/>Proportionality <lb/>The options available to ensure adequate capacity and security of electricity supply can lead <lb/>governments to reintroduce a significant degree of regulation of the generation market. A heavy‐ <lb/>handed market intervention may undermine the liberalisation objective and the expected <lb/>benefits in terms of least cost dispatch, efficient operation and market‐based investments. <lb/>A proportional regulatory intervention is one whose scope and form does not exceed what is <lb/>necessary to address the issue that needs to be fixed and its social costs. A proportional market <lb/>design reform is one that neither under‐regulates nor over‐regulates. In general, the more social <lb/>costs are at stake, the more effective the measures imposed should be: electricity rationing is not <lb/>an option for IEA member countries&apos; governments. Striving for proportionality can help to ensure <lb/>that measures are appropriate for the issue, that they don&apos;t pursue distinct objectives and thus <lb/>are more predictable. This notion is used in competition law in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, <lb/>where competition statutes expressly require remedies to be proportionate to the infringement <lb/>committed (OECD, 2008). <lb/>Options A (improved climate and low‐carbon policies) and B (better energy only markets) <lb/>addresses the roots of the problem and thus can be considered as proportionate measures. The <lb/>analysis of option C (standards and procedure) is intermediate and depends on specific measures <lb/>under consideration. Options D and E are interventions that significantly affect the functioning of <lb/>energy markets. Indeed, even where there are price caps, the simple anticipation by market <lb/>players of political intervention to cap power prices is one of the key issues. Assuming this is <lb/>actually the case, incremental enhancement of energy‐only market design can reinforce the <lb/>credibility of governments or even didactic presentation for policy makers may be sufficient. <lb/>Instead, a market‐wide capacity mechanism may seem heavy‐handed and complex. <lb/>Effectiveness <lb/>Electricity systems involve a significant degree of complexity and enhancing one specific measure <lb/>does not necessarily produce the expected effect. Other events can occur and gaming effects can <lb/>lead to unanticipated consequences, which can, in turn, erode the confidence in market‐based <lb/>solutions to ensure sufficient and timely investments. <lb/>An effective option to ensure generation adequacy has to guarantee enough certainty to have <lb/>timely and sufficient investments. It is necessary to assess to what extent the issue will be <lb/>reduced if the option is successfully implemented. Accordingly, policy makers may prefer quick <lb/>fixes to eliminate the symptoms rather than addressing the roots of the problems: If you don&apos;t <lb/>have enough capacity, just ask the system operator to add new capacity! This is simple to <lb/>understand, has visible effects and keeps the lights on. <lb/>Among the options available, this is exactly what targeted contracts do and also what capacity <lb/>markets do more indirectly, by defining directly reliability criteria not in terms of value of lost load <lb/>(voll) but in terms of capacity requirements. However, the effect of more market‐based options is <lb/>more indirect, difficult to monitor and can be affected by financing conditions. But in case of a <lb/>blackout, those responsible for system security will be blamed for having relied on dubious <lb/>solutions. <lb/>Lead time <lb/>Designing and implementing proper policies takes time. The process involves asking experts to <lb/>write reports, organising consultations of stakeholders, drafting legislation and bringing the bill to <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 87 <lb/>vote. Once the bills are approved, the administration must draft decrees and administrative <lb/>orders. Overall, policy changes can be a slow process subject to shifts in governments and <lb/>changes in political priorities or negative arbitrage, all of which have the potential to ruin several <lb/>years of efforts. <lb/>The lead time can be defined as the duration between the initial policy proposal and the date by <lb/>which it enters into force and begins to have effects. Moreover, even after it enters into force, it <lb/>may take a few years to build a track record showing that a new market design produces the right <lb/>signals and is sufficiently stable. For instance, a few years with peak prices not followed by <lb/>regulatory intervention could be necessary to build trust in an energy‐only market design. <lb/>This has two implications. First, when regulatory change occurs, it should be done well in advance <lb/>and in a planned and well communicated way. An example is the current energy policy developed <lb/>in the United Kingdom, which started in 2008 with a White Paper on nuclear and is expected to <lb/>come into force in 2013‐14 with the first Contracts for Difference (CfD). Second, when there is no <lb/>time left, governments may be obliged to choose more rapid, though less efficient options. <lb/>The leads times for the various options presented above differ: <lb/> Global climate policies (option A) will not be clarified until 2015 for an application after 2020, <lb/>at best. <lb/> Regional climate and renewable policies (option A) take a few years to be defined and may not <lb/>produce effects before 2020. Moreover, changing an existing renewable support scheme may <lb/>be a complex and quite long process. <lb/> Incremental change of energy‐only market design (option B) is a quicker option to implement − <lb/>a few months or years − but a track record may be necessary before they deliver adequate <lb/>capacity. <lb/> Standards and norms (option C) can also be quickly introduced and applied. <lb/> Targeted contracts (option D) is by far the most rapid option as contracts can always be signed <lb/>in a few months in order to ensure system security in a hurry. <lb/> Introducing capacity mechanisms (option E) may take two or three years. Unlike the case of <lb/>market design evolutions, they produce effects as soon as they enter into force. <lb/>The slow pace of development of energy policies and the long time associated with energy <lb/>investment and decisions is a matter of uncertainty. Energy policies can change with <lb/>governments. New administrations can undo a law before it takes effect, or even after. Some <lb/>degree of uncertainty seems inevitable: while stable regulation is of key importance for successful <lb/>market functioning, governments cannot stick to unsuccessful or too costly regulatory reforms. <lb/>Simplicity <lb/>Several overlapping policies already influence the framework for electricity markets, <lb/>encompassing. not only liberalisation but also carbon policy, renewable policies and energy <lb/>efficiency policies. It appears that this increasingly complex market environment increases the <lb/>perceived policy risk. While originally designed to be complementary and consistent policies, each <lb/>one tends to become autonomous and live its own life. The typical approach has been to add new <lb/>regulations to fix issues resulting from other regulations. Uncertainty over the future pace of <lb/>these policies and continuous regulatory changes can push the attractiveness of the industry <lb/>down. <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 88 <lb/>A simple policy is a policy that is capable of avoiding unnecessarily complex policy or regulatory <lb/>intervention. It must be easy to understand, as far as possible use existing procedures and IT <lb/>tools; and should aim to replace old policies rather than adding a new layer of regulation. <lb/>Among the options considered here, forward capacity market (option E) is by far the most <lb/>complex, as it requires setting‐up an entirely new system. Climate policies (option A) also involve <lb/>a certain degree of complexity, as they usually rely on a set of policy instruments such as carbon <lb/>pricing, FiT, auctions for renewables, energy efficiency policies, and so on standards and <lb/>procedures (option C) and targeted measures (option D) are relatively simple to understand and <lb/>implement and can normally be abandoned easily. Improving energy‐only markets can also be <lb/>regarded as fairly simple, although the design details must be carefully defined. <lb/>Direct cost <lb/>Regulation is not free. Regulators need staff, information and consultancy to do their job. In <lb/>addition, corporations also bear costs and establishing new trading electronic platforms entails <lb/>expenditure. At first glance, these costs may appear relatively limited compared to the expected <lb/>benefits of new measures. However, public spending is coming under increasing pressure and <lb/>many member countries must streamline their administrative processes. <lb/>Given its complexity, creating capacity markets (option E) tends to be relatively more costly than <lb/>other options. Improving existing market design and standards and procedures (options A and C) <lb/>are incremental evolutions and their costs are easier to predict and lower. <lb/>Indirect cost <lb/>The costs of regulation must be viewed dynamically, taking into account the potential impact on <lb/>the adoption of new technologies and practices. Indeed, these dynamic effects often represent a <lb/>significant potential cost of regulations. Indirect dynamic costs can make market performance <lb/>even worse than if we simply lived with the market imperfections. (Joskow, 2010) <lb/>Avoiding indirect costs is about preventing rules or distortions that can create barriers to new <lb/>technology development. Solutions that create a level playing field, e.g. a comparable treatment <lb/>for all technologies, are more likely to limit indirect costs. Appropriately designed solutions should <lb/>focus on solving the causes of issues, such as policy risk or better designed markets. On the <lb/>contrary, options that pick up technologies such as targeted contracts, and in certain cases, <lb/>standards and norms, carry the risk of significant indirect costs. <lb/>Adaptability <lb/>By many aspects, liberalisation in still a work in progress in many countries, and integration of <lb/>renewables is expected to require future changes of market design. Market integration over large <lb/>geographical areas will bring benefits. It reduces dispatching and balancing costs and facilitates <lb/>the accommodation of increasing shares of variable renewables. As these developments are <lb/>foreseen, policy makers need to anticipate that further harmonisation will be required. <lb/>The two fundamental principles which ensure the adaptability of a regulatory arrangement are: <lb/> reversibility, in order to remove the new regulation if it is not needed anymore, and <lb/> ability to be harmonised, so that the regulatory option can converge rapidly with other <lb/>systems. <lb/>Market‐wide capacity mechanisms tend to be less adaptable than targeted contracts. The <lb/>possibility to adapt other options would depend on design details. <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>Page | 89 <lb/>Acronyms, abbreviations and units of measure <lb/>Acronyms and abbreviations <lb/>2DS <lb/>2‐degree Celsius scenario of Energy Technology Perspectives <lb/>AEMO <lb/>Australian Energy Market Operator <lb/>BANANA <lb/>build absolutely nothing near anyone <lb/>BEV <lb/>battery electric vehicle <lb/>CCGT <lb/>combined cycle gas turbine <lb/>CCS <lb/>carbon capture and storage <lb/>CfD <lb/>contracts for difference <lb/>CHP <lb/>combined heat and power <lb/>CO 2 <lb/>carbon dioxide <lb/>EEG <lb/>Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz <lb/>ESAP <lb/>Electricity Security Action Plan <lb/>ETS <lb/>European Emissions Trading Scheme <lb/>EUR <lb/>European Utilities Requirements <lb/>FCEV <lb/>fuel‐cell electric vehicle <lb/>FiT <lb/>feed‐in tariffs <lb/>GIVAR <lb/>Grid Integration of Variable Renewables <lb/>HEV <lb/>hybrid electric vehicle <lb/>HVC <lb/>high value chemical <lb/>ICE <lb/>internal combustion engine <lb/>LED <lb/>light emitting diode <lb/>LMP <lb/>locational marginal pricing <lb/>LSIP <lb/>large‐scale integrated project <lb/>NEM <lb/>Australian National Electricity Market <lb/>PHEV <lb/>plug‐in hybrid electric vehicle <lb/>PPA <lb/>power purchase agreements <lb/>PV <lb/>photovoltaic <lb/>RGGI <lb/>Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative <lb/>RO <lb/>reliability option <lb/>RMR <lb/>reliability must‐run contracts <lb/>VRE <lb/>variable renewable energy <lb/>WACC <lb/>weighted average cost of capital <lb/>Units of measure <lb/>GW <lb/>gigawatt <lb/>MWh <lb/>megawatt hours <lb/>TWh <lb/>terawatt hours <lb/>Securing Power during the Transition <lb/>© OECD/IEA 2012 <lb/>Page | 90 <lb/></body>
