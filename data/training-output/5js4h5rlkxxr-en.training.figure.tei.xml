            <figDesc>Literature review of the economic studies relating to the existence of economies of scale in hospitals<lb/> 37.<lb/> The empirical literature has considered economies of scale in hospitals from two different angles.<lb/> Much of the literature has analysed the relationship between the size of hospitals and the cost of care<lb/> provided, trying to identify the optimum size of hospitals. A second approach, covered by much less<lb/> literature, has attempted to establish the relationship between the level of activity of hospitals and the cost<lb/> of care production. Here, the underlying question is how production costs change when the quantity of care<lb/> provided increases. Literature covering the second approach is relevant to explore marginal costs for care<lb/> beyond a certain level of activity.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Three studies conclude that there are diseconomies of scale: Vita (1990), Smet (2006) and Cohen<lb/> et al. (2010). In these studies, the measured elasticity is on average 1.56, which means that an increase in<lb/> hospital activity by 1% brings about an increase of 1.56% of costs in the hospitals studied. These studies,<lb/> in particular those of Smet (2007) and Cohen et al (2011), suffer from some limitations. First, in the study<lb/> by Smet (2007), data relating to input costs and in particular salaries are not available. Thus, the author<lb/> does not include in his analysis the differences in salaries between hospitals or their impact on costs. This<lb/> limitation may create a bias in the results. It may, in fact, be assumed that there is a correlation, expected to<lb/> be positive, between salaries and quantity produced (i.e. a link between better salaries and higher<lb/> productivity). If this is true, the study overestimated the impact of activity on costs. The main limitation of<lb/> the study by Cohen et al. (2010) is the small number of hospitals 30 hospitals), which affects the precision<lb/> of estimates and generalizability of results.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Efficiency in the hospital sector, economies of scope and influence of hospitals&apos; status on costs<lb/> The studies presented for the analysis of economies of scale also shed some light on two important<lb/> problematic areas related to the efficiency of production in the hospital sector.<lb/> First, studies analysing economies of scale also present results on economies of scope in the hospital<lb/> sector. An enterprise can generate economies of scope if it reduces its production costs by widening its range of<lb/> products and services (joint production). Diversification of production may take two different forms: related<lb/> diversification and conglomerate diversification. Related diversification refers to the development of new activities<lb/> that share some characteristics with existing activities. The diversification may be vertical or horizontal.<lb/> Conglomerate diversification refers to the development of new activities which have no common ground with<lb/> existing activities. Only economies of scope from related diversification seem to be appropriate in the hospital<lb/> sector.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In the 16 Länder, regional associations of hospitals and insurers negotiate the regional base rates.<lb/> Factors to be taken into account in these negotiations include the projected development of costs, potential<lb/> efficiency savings, and the prospective change in number and severity of cases (case-mix). Having said<lb/> that, some restrictions in the Länder negotiations apply: Since 2014 Länder base rates must lie within a<lb/> band between +2.5% and -1.25% of the federal base rate 7 . Additionally, the annual increases in the base<lb/> rates at Länder level cannot exceed the increase of the federal base rate.<lb/> 66.<lb/> In most of the Länder (9 of the 16), the negotiations in 2014 resulted in a Länder base rate below<lb/> the minimum value of the band. Consequently, these Länder base rates had to be raised to reach this<lb/> threshold.</figDesc>

        <figure>

            <figDesc>Technical considerations<lb/> 68.<lb/> In Germany two separate mechanisms exist to reduce the hospital tariffs per case within the DRG<lb/> framework. The first type of tapering rate is applied to additional negotiated hospital volumes; the second<lb/> is applied to all volume beyond the negotiated revenue budget, i.e. the non-negotiated volume.<lb/>  Any increase in activity volume (based on the case-mix) compared to year t-1 within the range of<lb/> negotiated volumes for year t is reimbursed at rate tapered by 25% (rate in force in 2013 and<lb/> 2014) 8 . This mechanism is known as the Mehrleistungsabschlag 9 or MLA.<lb/> 7<lb/> Exceptions apply to those Länder who have been historically above this band; their base rates are only<lb/> gradually reduced to finally reach the upper limit of the corridor.  Hospitals have to pay back 65% of all revenue related to activity exceeding the negotiated<lb/> volume. This means hospitals can only keep 35% of these additional revenues. This mechanism<lb/> is known as the Mehrerlösausgleich 10 or MEA. As a counterbalance for the tapering rate, all<lb/> negotiated services which could not be delivered are paid by insurers at a rate of 20%.<lb/> 69.<lb/> An overview of the technical application of the two rates is displayed in Chart 1. For MLA, the<lb/> tapered rate changed continually between 2009 and 2014. In 2009 -the year of its introduction -the rate<lb/> was negotiated for each Land separately, averaging out at 24%. Tapering was abandoned for negotiated<lb/> volumes in 2010 but reintroduced in 2011 with a tapered rate of 30%. The rate was again negotiated in<lb/> 2012, and in 2013 and 2014 it was set at 25%. Moreover, the benchmark year for calculating additional<lb/> volumes in 2013 and 2014 was 2012.<lb/> </figDesc>

<lb/> 
            <figDesc>The first level of tapering (MLA) is applicable to all DRGs with some exceptions. In practical<lb/> terms, the monetary value of the MLA is only known after the negotiation of hospital volumes and the<lb/> MLA translates into a percentage reduction of all DRGs billed to insurers after the negotiated volume is<lb/> agreed on. Some negotiated additional services are exempt from this reduction, for example, in the case of<lb/> transplants, volume growth that is based on increases in hospital capacity, DRGs where material costs<lb/> account for more than two-thirds of the total cost, and in hardship cases.<lb/> 71.<lb/> The MEA applies to the non-negotiated volume; 65% of all revenues exceeding the revenue<lb/> budget which is based on the negotiated volume have to be reimbursed by hospitals. But some exceptions<lb/> also apply, for example, for additional revenues generated from treatment of severely injured patients; in<lb/> these cases, a 25% reduction is applied which means that hospitals can keep 75% of the additional<lb/> revenues.<lb/> Rationale for introduction<lb/> 72.<lb/> Tapering payment in Germany was introduced in 1985 in Germany, before DRG-based<lb/> payments, when hospitals were still paid through per-diem rates. During that period, payments for<lb/> additional treatments which resulted in revenues in excess of the negotiated budgeted revenue had to be<lb/> partially reimbursed by the hospital. The reduction was justified by economies of scale in hospital<lb/> production. This assumption, however, does not seem to have been based on empirical evidence at that<lb/> time. It was argued that fixed costs of hospitals were already completely covered with payments generated<lb/> within the negotiated hospital budget; payment for additional cases would therefore only have to reflect<lb/> variable costs. By the same reasoning, hospitals received partial payments for the non-generated cases that<lb/> fell short of the negotiated volumes. These compensations were introduced to give hospital managers some<lb/> financial security for partial coverage of their fixed costs in case of an unexpected shortfall in demand for<lb/> inpatient services. This mechanism was called &quot; flexible budgeting &quot; (Tuschen at al., 2005).<lb/> 73.<lb/> The principle concept of this tapering mechanism was maintained when hospital remuneration<lb/> moved towards DRG payments from 2003 on and is still applicable.<lb/> 74.<lb/> A second type of tapering – the MLA – was introduced in 2009 which is applied to all additional<lb/> negotiated hospital volume which is above the volume of the previous year. Although introduced later than<lb/> the tapering for non-negotiated revenue, it can technically be considered as the 1 st level of tapering.<lb/> Tapering rates and technical modalities of this 1 st level have been constantly changing since its<lb/> implementation. The aim of tapering for negotiated volumes has been subject to change since its<lb/> introduction in 2009. Whereas the initial objective was to limit growth in hospital expenditure 11 -in 2011<lb/> and 2012 the MLA was supposed to generate savings by 350 Mio EUR and 270 Mio EUR respectively -<lb/>controlling the increase in hospital volumes eventually became the objective in 2013 and 2014 12 .</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Maryland (United States) 13<lb/> Basic facts of health system<lb/> 80.<lb/> The United States is one of the few OECD countries where public coverage of health care costs is<lb/> relatively low. The majority of Americans have private insurance that either they or their employer have<lb/> taken out. In the State of Maryland in 2013, 73.6% of the population had this type of cover compared to<lb/> 64.2% in the United States as a whole. 14<lb/> 81.<lb/> The government manages the two principal public insurance schemes for low-income groups<lb/> (Medicaid and Medicare). Medicare is a federal programme for residents over 65 years of age, the disabled<lb/> and people with terminal-stage kidney disease. Medicaid, a state-based programme, covers people with<lb/> low incomes. In Maryland, 14.4% (compared to 15.6% for the United States as a whole) of the population<lb/> were insured by Medicare and 15.3% (17.3% for the US as a whole) by Medicaid. These programmes are<lb/> funded through taxation, but the beneficiaries are not covered automatically: they must sign up and, in<lb/> some circumstances, pay premiums.<lb/> 82.<lb/> A substantial proportion of the entire population of the US, estimated at around 14.5% in 2013,<lb/> had no health insurance; the figure for Maryland was 10.2% (Smith and Medalia, 2014). The Affordable<lb/> Care Act adopted in 2010 seeks to gradually extend health insurance coverage, which has been compulsory<lb/> for all citizens and legal residents since January 2014. From that date, anyone who does not have sickness<lb/> insurance may be subject to a fine. 15<lb/> 83.<lb/> Private insurance coverage is heavily concentrated in Maryland as the insurer Carefirst has 66%<lb/> of the &quot; individual cover &quot; market, 73% of the small business market 16 and 70% of the large business<lb/> market.<lb/> 84.<lb/> In 2009, the share of the gross domestic product of Maryland allocated to health expenditure<lb/> matched that of the United States, i.e. 15%. Annual growth in health expenditure in the State of Maryland<lb/> was equivalent to that of the whole of the United States between 1991 and 2009; for Maryland, the annual<lb/> growth was 6.6% compared to 6.5% for the United States as a whole.<lb/> 85.<lb/> In 2009, per capita health expenditure was 10% higher in Maryland than in the United States as a<lb/> whole (USD 7 492 compared to USD 6 815). Several possible explanations for this include higher care<lb/> costs and a larger population covered by health insurance than the United States average.<lb/> 13<lb/> Unless otherwise stated, the statistics used for Maryland and the United States have been taken from the<lb/> Kaiser Family Foundation database (http://kff.org/).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In order to set unit rates per cost item, the HSCRC collects detailed data on costs using an<lb/> accounting system that assesses costs based on activity and allocates direct and indirect costs to each<lb/> revenue item. Hospitals are required to supply data on costs if they want to be eligible for reimbursement<lb/> under Medicare. The data make it possible to calculate costs by day for each cost centre.<lb/> 95.<lb/> The unit rates are then adjusted to take account of the diversity of patients in each hospital<lb/> notably on the basis of the location of the hospital and the proportion of patients from each ethnic group.<lb/> They also take labour market differences into account. The allowed total charges per case (tariff) is the<lb/> sum of the product of the unit rates and the units used for each cost item involved in the treatment process<lb/> of one case. So tariffs for the Johns Hopkins Hospital, a teaching hospital based in Baltimore, Maryland,<lb/> are not the same as those for a rural hospital.

            <figDesc>a significant increase in the volume of<lb/> inpatient admissions, outpatient visits and operating costs following the abolition of tapering between 2001<lb/> and 2008. Once tapering was removed in 2001, admissions and outpatient consultations rose by 7.7% and<lb/> 17.1% respectively – a significant increase compared to the preceding years. The yearly rate of growth in<lb/> admissions rose significantly when tapering was abolished, from 0.8% between 1991 and 2001 to 2.4%<lb/> between 2001 and 2008. Similarly, hospital operating costs rose relatively sharply: the annual growth rate<lb/> for operating costs increased from 4.8% between 1991 and 2001 to 8.4% between 2001 and 2008. Costs<lb/> therefore grew more quickly than volumes. This study shows that hospitals react to changes in financial<lb/> incentives. Kalman&apos;s study (2014) concludes that tapering can act as a model to constrain growth both in<lb/> hospital volumes and in costs within the hospital sector.<lb/> 110.<lb/> However, the sharp growth in hospital volumes (admissions, readmissions, emergency visits,<lb/> outpatient care) over the period 2001 to 2008 led the HSCRC to introduce several plans to change the way<lb/> hospitals were paid in recent years. These included: progressive switch to global budgets for hospital<lb/> payment; reintroduction of the tapering system; and performance-based payments for hospitals.</figDesc>

With<lb/> 6.8 beds per 1 000 population, the Czech Republic ranks seventh in the OECD and is above the OECD<lb/> average (4.9 beds per 1 000 population).

            <figDesc>According to Ministry of Health estimates, 80% of hospital receipts for medical, surgical and<lb/> obstetric care come from DRG-based payments. The remaining 20% of hospitals&apos; revenue relate to other<lb/> activities and are subject to bilateral agreements between insurers and hospitals.<lb/> 122.<lb/> Until 2007, the principal means of payment for hospitals was a global budget system. In 2008,<lb/> some services were reimbursed through DRG-based payment but revenues for each hospital could differ by<lb/> only 1% (above or below) of the amount that would have been paid under the global budget. This range<lb/> was referred to as the &quot; risk corridor &quot; . Thus, initially, the expected hospital volumes were determined using<lb/> the historic volumes which were used to define the prospective global budgets (as was the case before<lb/> 2008). The total revenue based on DRG-based payments for the same volume of care was then calculated.<lb/> If this amount was outside the risk corridor then the hospital was paid by global budget.<lb/> 123.<lb/> Since 2009, activity-based payment (DRG) has been the predominant payment system for<lb/> hospital activity and the risk corridor no longer exists. It replaced the global budget and has been used<lb/> since that date (except for the year 2011 when global budget was re-introduced for one year). The<lb/> classification is based on International Refined-DRG and adjusted to fit Czech circumstances. There are<lb/> approximately 1 000 DRGs associated with relative cost weights. DRG weights include costs for<lb/> medications, medical devices and physicians&apos; salaries.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The Ministry of Health determines the formula used to set the activity caps (expressed in terms of<lb/> case mix) above which tapering applies. Caps are set for each hospital-insurer pair. Thus, each hospital has<lb/> to consider separate activity caps for the billing of services to each individual insurer. It is not the total<lb/> volume produced by a hospital that is decisive for the application of tapering but the volume provided for<lb/> each insurer. The formula changes each year because the Ministry tries to ensure that the system is<lb/> financially balanced (see Annex 3 for a detailed description of the formula used in 2013). 129.<lb/> The tapering payment mechanism can be broken down into two main steps:</figDesc>
