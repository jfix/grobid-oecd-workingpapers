            <figDesc>do this using a vector auto-regression approach fitted on US cereal-programme food<lb/> aid sent to 18 developing countries between 1961-95. They find that in the short run commercial<lb/> imports of the recipient country indeed decrease (-30 per cent of food aid), but in the long run a<lb/> J-curve appears, and commercial imports resume after five years. This rise in imports benefits<lb/> third countries more than the donor country. A possible explanation for this long-term rise<lb/> comes from induced shifts in consumer tastes, income effects and transaction costs reduced by<lb/> the development of distribution channels 10 . Yet there are considerable differences in the<lb/> magnitudes of aid, production and trade. The mean aid volume in the sample is only 9 per cent<lb/> of mean production and 17 per cent of commercial imports. Therefore, even if the conditional<lb/> expectation of food aid&apos;s effect on commercial imports does follow a J-curve, one cannot say that<lb/> food aid drives recipient-country trade patterns.</figDesc>

In 2001, the Doha Development Agenda<lb/> Global Trust Fund was launched, and the IF and JITAP were revamped and expanded in 2003.<lb/> Bilateral and multilateral trade-assistance commitments increased to a total of almost $2.8 billion<lb/> in 2003 (see WTO/OECD, 2004, for details on the distribution of these activities by donor,<lb/> recipient and category of assistance).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The fragmentation of trade-related assistance does not help an overall assessment of its<lb/> impact on trade, not to say growth. The methodology used in the few available studies estimates<lb/> the costs of trade transactions and simulates the impact of a decrease in them. No study known<lb/> to the present authors directly evaluates the impact of trade assistance on reducing trade<lb/> transaction costs. An OECD report (2003) gives some estimates of those costs. They range from<lb/> 1 per cent to 15 per cent of traded goods&apos; value. The computations are based mostly on business<lb/> surveys and make some assumptions for the opportunity costs (in monetary terms) of time delay<lb/> or inventory holding. Trade transaction costs seem higher for agricultural products (due to<lb/> additional sanitary and phytosanitary inspections). They also are higher for developing<lb/> countries, and considerable variation in border waiting times exists particularly for countries<lb/> with per capita incomes of less than $9 000.<lb/> Researchers have taken two routes based on these evaluations of trade transaction costs:<lb/> • Introducing trade transaction costs in a gravity model of bilateral trade, along</figDesc>

Trade<lb/> facilitation is introduced as technical progress in trading activities that reduces the<lb/> cost of trading (indirect effect) and can entail a reduction in logistics duties paid to<lb/> the public sector (direct effect). Examples appear in Fox et al. (2003) and OECD<lb/> (2003).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The<lb/> gain will be smaller for Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), sub-Saharan African and<lb/> Latin American exports than for South Asian exports, because they have less access to OECD<lb/> markets.<lb/> The CGE simulations in OECD (2003) take into account a loss in logistic duties and<lb/> reduced corruption following trade facilitation. Thus, the positive impact is attenuated by an<lb/> adjustment in the government sector. They also model diversity in trade transaction costs due to<lb/> sectors&apos; and firms&apos; heterogeneity. They show that an overall and uniform reduction of trade<lb/> transaction costs by 1 per cent of the value of world trade would entail a trade gain of $38 billion.<lb/> Reducing border waiting times accounts for 80 per cent of it. Most of it would go to OECD<lb/> countries (69 per cent) and to a lesser extent the Asia-Pacific Region. MENA and the Latin<lb/> America/Caribbean (LAC) region would each get 5 per cent of the benefit and sub-Saharan<lb/> Africa a mere 2 per cent.

The basic idea considers<lb/> the following set of assumptions:<lb/> a) countries have identical relative factor endowments;<lb/> b) countries have identical technologies;<lb/> c) countries have identical homothetic preferences;<lb/> d) production has constant returns to scale;<lb/> e) production is characterised by perfect competition; and,<lb/> f) there are no domestic distortions in either country.</figDesc>
