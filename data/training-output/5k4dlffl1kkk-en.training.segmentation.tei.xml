Looking ahead, the Netherlands needs to <lb/>shift the trade and investment orientation from traditional slow-growing markets to faster growing <lb/>emerging economies, in order to keep reaping the benefits from globalisation. In addition, the ongoing <lb/>globalisation will push companies to become more innovative and search for new activities. Against this <lb/>backdrop, the government is reforming its policies for the business sector. This includes a targeted <lb/>approach, where the government is attempting to strengthen key sectors to become even stronger players <lb/>on the international scene. This approach, however, carries some of the risks of more traditional industrial <lb/>policy, making careful policy design and evaluation important elements for successful implementation. <lb/>The other building block of the new policies is a strengthening of framework conditions, which promises a <lb/>more market-based development of comparative advantages, and which could be further strengthened by <lb/>broadening the approach to include other policies, such as competition policies. This Working Paper <lb/>relates to the 2012 OECD Economic Survey of the Netherlands (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/netherlands). <lb/>JEL classification codes: F6 ; F15, F21 <lb/>Keywords: Globalisation, Economic Integration, International Investments <lb/>******* <lb/>Réformer les politiques relatives au secteur des entreprises pour récolter les fruits de la <lb/>mondialisation aux Pays-Bas <lb/>Les Pays-Bas ont fortement bénéficié de la mondialisation, qui a dynamisé les échanges internationaux, les <lb/>investissements transfrontaliers et la croissance économique au cours des dernières décennies.

En outre, la poursuite du processus de <lb/>mondialisation va pousser les entreprises à devenir plus innovantes et à rechercher de nouvelles activités. <lb/>Dans ce contexte, le gouvernement est en train de réformer ses politiques relatives au secteur des <lb/>entreprises.

			<body>Reforming policies for the business sector to harvest the benefits of <lb/>globalisation in the Netherlands <lb/>By Mathijs Gerritsen and Jens Høj 1 <lb/>The economy has been benefiting from accelerating globalisation and technology change. The <lb/>increase in world trade has allowed the Netherlands to capitalise on Rotterdam&apos;s position as the main trade <lb/>gateway to Europe. Both inward and outward foreign investment has increased, fostering the transfer of <lb/>new technologies and efficiency-enhancing separation of production – ultimately supporting productivity <lb/>growth. Moreover, consumers have benefited from downward pressure on prices via cheaper imports from <lb/>emerging economies and greater choice. However, looking ahead, there is a need to strengthen export and <lb/>investment linkages with emerging markets, while ongoing globalisation forces companies to innovate and <lb/>search for new activities in which they can excel -partly as emerging markets quickly move up the value <lb/>added chain. To capitalise on the opportunities and challenges from globalisation the Dutch government is <lb/>reforming its policies for the business sector. The main thrust of the new policy approach is: to focus on <lb/>areas of excellence, particularly in the form of a &quot; top sector approach &quot; ; and to improve framework <lb/>conditions for the entire private sector, referred to as the &quot; economic agenda &quot; . The paper first analyses how <lb/>globalisation has shaped the Dutch economy and identifies major challenges. Then, the paper assesses <lb/>policies to strengthen the business sector in the context of globalisation and its interplay with other <lb/>policies. The paper concludes with a set of policy recommendations. <lb/>The benefits and challenges of globalisation <lb/>The Dutch position as a trading nation and gateway to Europe has allowed the economy to profit from <lb/>globalisation for centuries. The golden age in the 17 th century benefitted from skilled immigrants, <lb/>innovations (e.g. the sawmill and freely transferable shares) and access to distant markets (e.g. Japan) <lb/>allowing the economy to become a world leader (Barbour, 1950; Van Nieuwkerk, 2006). More recently, <lb/>the latest decades of intensified globalisation has seen lower tariff barriers, technological progress, and a <lb/>fall in transport and communication costs, which have fragmented production processes and strengthened <lb/>the economic links to the rest of the world (Figure 1.). 2 <lb/>1. <lb/>Jens Høj is Head of Belgium and the Netherlands desk in the Economics Department of the OECD. <lb/>Mathijs Gerritsen is an economist at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Since the early 1990s, the share of goods <lb/>exports to GDP has increased from about 40% to 60%. Trade is highly concentrated with 1% of firms <lb/>accounting for more than 70% of all exports (in value), while only around 11% of all firms are engaged in <lb/>export activities (Statistics Netherlands, 2011). The exporting firms have in common that they tend to be <lb/>larger, more productive and more skill and capital-intensive than non-exporting firms (Bernard et al., 2007; <lb/>Van Bergeijk et al., 2011). The export market performance for goods has been stronger than in many other <lb/>OECD countries (Figure 2). This reflects to a large degree a surge in re-exports of goods that often enter <lb/>through the port of Rotterdam and which receive minor treatment (with value-added that is on average one <lb/>eight of domestically produced goods) in the Netherlands before being re-exported (Box 1 and Figure 1) <lb/>(Mellens et al., 2007; Kuypers et al., 2012). Particularly, the transport and logistics sectors are benefiting <lb/>from this surge in the trade of goods. In this connection, a policy challenge is to ensure that infrastructure <lb/>capacities keep up with private activity, where a road-pricing scheme would secure an efficient use of <lb/>existing infrastructure as emphasized in the previous Economic Survey. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></body>

As gateway to the continent, the port and industrial complex stretches over 40 kilometres and covers some <lb/>10 thousand hectares. This excludes Maasvlakte 2, which is currently under construction and covers an additional 2 thousand <lb/>hectares. The port handles about 430 million tons of cargo a year – corresponding to a 40% market share of North Sea port <lb/>traffic (ports from Hamburg to Le Havre). Out of more than 18 thousand containers a day, Rotterdam ships on average over <lb/>4 thousand containers with China as the country of destination or origin. Reflecting bilateral trade volumes, about 40% of the <lb/>containers from Rotterdam to China are empty, against 1% of the incoming ones. <lb/>With an extensive network of hinterland connections – inland shipping, coastal shipping, rail, road and pipelines – <lb/>Rotterdam facilitates the import and export of goods from and to the European market. Containers mainly go by road <lb/>transport (57%), followed by inland shipping (33%) and rail transport (10%). Besides its role as distribution hub, the port offers <lb/>facilities for the storage and handling of all kinds of commodities and products, while processing and chemical industries have <lb/>a strong presence. <lb/>For 2008, direct employment within the port and industrial cluster is estimated at about 90 thousand people, and indirect <lb/>employment (e.g. suppliers, service providers) at 55 thousand. Activities related to the port of Rotterdam correspond to about <lb/>4% of GDP (Van den Bosch et al., 2011). The Port Authority expects economic activity to increase rapidly, reflected by a <lb/>projected increase of total throughput by up to 74%, to 750 million tons in 2030. Growth projections are especially strong for <lb/>container shipment, while dry and liquid bulk handling is expected to grow more moderately. The expected expansion of <lb/>activities poses considerable challenges related to e.g. spatial planning, the environment and hinterland connection. <lb/></body>

			<body>The port of Rotterdam plays an important role in the surge in re-exports. In the Netherlands, these exports are defined <lb/>as goods that are imported and then leave the country without undergoing much processing. Re-exports represent about half <lb/>of total exports of goods, and are (contrary to transit trade) included in the trade statistics as soon as a Dutch company <lb/>temporarily becomes the owner of the goods. Europe is the most important destination with 85% of all re-exports, which <lb/>concerns mainly items like machinery, computers, electronic devices and chemical products. The average value added <lb/>content in re-exports (about EUR 7.5 cents per exported euro) is much lower than domestically produced goods (EUR 58.5 <lb/>cents). Nonetheless, the surge in re-exports has been an important driver of growth in the Netherlands, accounting in net <lb/>terms to an annual 0.2 percentage point to GDP growth over the last two decades (Kranendonk and Verbruggen, 2011). <lb/>Source: Port of Rotterdam Authority (2011a, b, c); Mellens et al. (2007); Van den Bosch et al. (2011); Kranendonk and <lb/>Verbruggen (2011); Kuypers et al. (2012). <lb/>Figure 3. Re-exports have surged ¹ <lb/>Current prices <lb/>1. <lb/>Data excludes energy. <lb/>2. <lb/>Re-exports according to Dutch classification. <lb/>Source: CPB (2012), CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. <lb/>Service trade has increased in line with goods exports, concerning activities like computer and <lb/>information, financial and transport services. This reflects the increased services content in the economy, <lb/>ongoing liberalisation of trade and investment, technological developments, as well as a related <lb/>fragmentation of the international value added chain (OECD, 2005; OECD, 2007a; DNB, 2007). In total, <lb/>service exports have remained stable at around 20% of total Dutch exports (Statistics Netherlands, 2011). <lb/>However, this hides the fact that service trade is often in relatively high value added activities. Nowadays, <lb/>about 40% of Dutch value added stemming from exports can be attributed to the exports of services, <lb/>against 25% in 1990 (Kranendonk and Verbruggen, 2011). <lb/>Dutch exports have benefited from strong import growth in rapidly growing emerging market <lb/>economies. Even though the Netherlands&apos; market shares in these markets have not increased since the mid <lb/>2000&apos;s, they account for an increasing share of total exports (Figure 4). Exports, nevertheless, remain <lb/>mainly concentrated in traditional and relatively slow growing markets in Europe and North America. <lb/>Indeed, compared to other OECD countries, the Netherlands exports relatively little to the emerging <lb/>economies (Figure 5), although distance, the composition of the export structure and the high share of <lb/>re-exports can partly explain the difference. 3 The picture is unchanged when taking into account indirect <lb/>exports to emerging economies (via Dutch goods used as inputs in other countries&apos; exports to the emerging <lb/>3. <lb/>In 2009, 3.8% of total goods exports had Brazil, Russia, India or China (BRIC countries) as destination, <lb/>against 4.3% of domestically produced exports goods (Statistics Netherlands, 2010c). <lb/></body>

			<body>economies) (Groot et al., 2011a). 4 Given the more dynamic long-term economic outlook of emerging <lb/>economies, it is important to secure better export penetration in these countries. However, doing business <lb/>in emerging markets is relatively complicated, e.g. due to cultural differences, regulatory barriers (to trade <lb/>and FDI), discriminatory procedures and government involvement in economic activity, which could <lb/>justify public intervention. <lb/>Figure 4.

In addition, <lb/>companies benefit from lower prices of intermediate goods. The share of goods imports from emerging <lb/>economies has increased rapidly since 1990, particularly from China, and competition from low-cost <lb/>foreign suppliers has dampened domestic inflation pressures. Conservative estimates suggest that <lb/>globalisation has reduced Dutch inflation up to 0.3 percentage points per annum in the period 2000–05 <lb/>(Pain et al., 2008). This calculation includes the emerging economies&apos; role in the surge of energy and <lb/>commodity prices. Looking ahead, the effect of globalisation on inflation is likely to weaken as the <lb/>emerging markets converge towards more advanced economies, although the effect on choice should <lb/>persist. <lb/>Globalisation spurred investment <lb/>Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the form of acquisitions and greenfield investment (i.e. opening a <lb/>new subsidiary) have increased rapidly over the last few decades to the highest level in the OECD when <lb/>measured by the value of inward and outward FDI positions. However, for the Netherlands, about three-<lb/>quarters is accounted for by Special Purpose Entities, i.e. subsidiaries of foreign parent companies that <lb/>function as financial turntables, benefit from the favourable Dutch tax regime and hardly affect the real <lb/>economy (DNB, 2008; DNB, 2011; Statistics Netherlands, 2011). 5 Subtracting these, the share of in-and <lb/>outward FDI remains relatively high (Figure 6). The inward FDI fosters technology spill-over, innovative <lb/>activities as well as capital deepening and enhance competitive pressures on domestic firms (Nicoletti et <lb/>al., 2003; Gelauff et al., 2010). Foreign affiliates account for a relatively large share of value-added, <lb/>investment and turnover and, to a lesser extent, employment (Table 1). In addition, these enterprises are <lb/>more innovative and productive and pay higher wages than domestically controlled counterparts (Statistics <lb/>Netherlands, 2008; 2009; 2010a). Indeed, foreign controlled enterprises account for about a third of R&amp;D <lb/>investments and half of total trade (Statistics Netherlands, 2010a; 2010b). However, a small part of the <lb/>5. <lb/>The favourable tax regime concerns the relatively low statutory corporate tax rate, the possibility of <lb/>advance tax ruling to give certainty about the level of taxation, the broad tax treaty network, a favourable <lb/> &quot; participation exemption &quot; regime, and a zero statutory withholding tax rate on outbound royalty payments, <lb/>among others (Top team Head Offices, 2011; NFIA, 2011). <lb/></body>

			<body>inward FDI comes from emerging markets. 6 This might be influenced by the often very vocal public debate <lb/>erupting in case of foreign takeovers -often centred on risks of job losses -despite that empirically such <lb/>takeovers have little or no impact on employment growth in subsequent years (Urlings et al., 2011). 7 <lb/>Figure 6. Relatively high in-and outward FDI <lb/>Stocks¹, as a percentage of GDP, 2010 <lb/>1. <lb/>Excluding Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) for Austria, and Netherlands. <lb/>Source: OECD (2012), International Direct Investment Statistics and National Accounts of OECD Countries -online databases, <lb/>February. <lb/>6. <lb/>Although FDI data do not suggest a substantial establishment of firms from emerging market economies in <lb/>the Netherlands, micro data in firm ownership indicate that the Netherlands seem to be an attractive <lb/>location in Europe for firms with their origin in the BRIC countries. The latter could be related to the large <lb/>distribution and logistics sectors (Groot et al., 2011b). <lb/>7. <lb/>An unfortunate development is the sometimes less positive public and political approach towards the <lb/>acquisitions of Dutch companies by foreign parties, especially when the investors find their origin in non <lb/>OECD countries. See, for instance, the discussions surrounding the acquisition of ECT by Hutchinson <lb/>Whampoa in 1999, Hoogovens/Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the attempted takeover of Draka by <lb/>Xinmao in 2011. <lb/></body>

Outward FDI allows firms to serve foreign markets and enhance the efficiency of production as <lb/>well as helping multinationals to build global R&amp;D networks to tap into local knowledge and develop new <lb/>technologies (OECD, 2007a). Outward FDI also reflects the outsourcing of production, mostly to European <lb/>countries although Asia is also a popular destination with about 30% of outsourcing activities (Statistics <lb/>Netherlands, 2011). The labour market effect of outsourcing is modest; most studies find that relatively <lb/>few jobs are involved in international outsourcing, especially compared to regular job turnover (e.g., <lb/>Gorter et. al., 2005; Heyma and Theeuwes, 2008). In particular, there appears to be no substantial <lb/>difference between unemployed workers from off-shoring and non-off-shoring industries in terms of <lb/>unemployment duration, reemployment probability and subsequent wages (Heyma and Theeuwes, 2008). <lb/>A relatively new development is that outsourcing is increasingly affecting highly-skilled employees and <lb/>services (OECD, 2005; Van Gorp, 2008 and 2010). Thus, looking ahead, outsourcing may expose a greater <lb/>share of the work force to international competition, increasing the need for reallocation of workers across <lb/>and within sectors (OECD, 2012). <lb/>Globalisation, including stronger international competition, forces companies to innovate. In addition, <lb/>as the population ages (OECD, 2012) economic growth must increasingly come from innovation-induced <lb/>productivity growth. However, private R&amp;D spending is well below the OECD and EU 15 averages and <lb/>has been declining over the past decade (Figure 7) (Court of Audit, 2011). 8 The persistently low R&amp;D ratio <lb/>mirrors the difficulties various policies have had in boosting private R&amp;D activities, though it can partly be <lb/>linked to the specialisation of the Dutch economy in relatively less R&amp;D intensive industries, particularly <lb/>in services (Erken and Ruiter, 2005; EIM, 2011; Schmidt-Ehmcke and Zloczysti, 2011). Moreover, little is <lb/>known about the relative effectiveness and efficiency of various public innovation schemes (Government, <lb/>2010; CPB, 2010; Lanser and Van der Wiel, 2011), calling for greater reliance on &quot; evidence-based policy <lb/>making &quot; , i.e. putting more emphasis on monitoring and evaluations to guide policies. <lb/>8. <lb/>Country rankings of innovation performance – that take into account a wide range of indicators to capture a <lb/>country&apos;s performance both on the output and input side of innovation – usually show the Netherlands in <lb/>the middle to upper range of OECD / EU countries. See the Synthetic Innovation Indicator by Rae and <lb/>Sollie (2008); the Innovation Union Scoreboard by the European Commission (2012) and the innovation <lb/>pillar of the Global Competitiveness Index by the World Economic Forum (2011). <lb/></body>

This has been supported by factors such as a well-educated labour force, <lb/>a strong business environment, sound access to other markets, and existing agglomeration and location <lb/>advantages. In addition, there has – so far – been limited overlap between the revealed comparative <lb/>advantages of the Netherlands and emerging countries (Groot et al., 2011b; Rae and Sollie, 2008; SER, <lb/>2008). However, companies may face tougher competition in the future from emerging economies, as these <lb/>are quickly moving up the value-added chain. Indeed, the integration of these new players is challenging <lb/>existing comparative advantages of countries, forcing companies to search for new activities in which they <lb/>can excel and to enhance their productivity by being more innovative (OECD, 2007a). At the same time, <lb/>the likely shift in global economic activity, notably towards Asia and Latin America, makes it important to <lb/>establish strong export and investment positions in these new zones of economic activity. In all, it is <lb/>important that policies for the business sector are continuously evaluated and updated to address these <lb/>challenges. <lb/>Benefiting from globalisation by strengthening the business environment <lb/>The government seeks to improve the competitiveness of the business sector, meet the challenges <lb/>from globalisation, and boost innovative activities by implementing a new policy for the business sector <lb/>(Box 2) (Ministry of EL&amp;I, 2011a; 2011b; 2012). The policy combines targeted support with an <lb/>improvement in general framework conditions, and consists of two main planks. One plank is a broad <lb/> &quot; economic agenda &quot; with a focus on framework conditions to reduce the regulatory burden, strengthen the <lb/>innovation framework, and improve access to risk capital. 9 The other plank is a targeted &quot; top sector <lb/>approach &quot; focussing on nine key sectors in the economy. The rationale for the new policy is to address <lb/>information asymmetries and coordination failures by linking the business sector, knowledge institutions <lb/>and the government. Indeed, a key feature is strong private sector involvement to facilitate demand driven <lb/>policies. The policy is still being developed. <lb/>9. <lb/>Other elements – which are outside the scope of the present discussion – include the improvement of <lb/>spatial economic conditions for economic clusters (e.g. related to the port of Rotterdam and Amsterdam <lb/>Schiphol airport), and the application of information and communication technology (ICT). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2. New policies for the business sector <lb/>In February 2011, the government presented a new policy to foster business sector competitiveness&apos; and prepare the <lb/>economy to face challenges and opportunities from globalisation. In addition, the new policy intends to help to address <lb/>economic and social goals related to population ageing, climate change and pressure on global resources. Specifically, the <lb/>government has set three targets: to be one of the top five knowledge economies in the world by 2020 (using the World <lb/>Economic Forum as a yardstick); increase R&amp;D spending to 2.5% of GDP (currently 1.8% of GDP); boost public-private <lb/>cooperation in knowledge and innovation activities to more than EUR ½ billion by 2015 (Ministry of Economic Affairs, <lb/>Agriculture and Innovation, 2011b). <lb/>The new policy has two planks: an &quot; economic agenda &quot; for the entire private sector and a &quot; top sector approach &quot; with <lb/>specific attention to nine economic sectors of the economy. In February 2011, the general framework and ideas were <lb/>outlined, after which an interactive process between public and private stakeholders progressively specified the new policies <lb/>(Table 1.2). Important building blocks are the demand driven approach -policies are mainly based on input from the private <lb/>sector – the reduction in innovation subsidies in exchange for tax credits, broader access to corporate finance, and fostering <lb/>the clustering of economic and research activities. Moreover, an important element is the stronger reliance on &quot; evidence-<lb/>based policy making &quot; , i.e. putting more emphasis on monitoring and evaluation to guide policies. Against the backdrop of the <lb/>need to consolidate public finances, the fiscal scope of the new enterprise policies is limited (gradually increasing to about <lb/>0.3% of GDP by 2015), and mainly involves a reallocation of different existing outlays to support business and innovative <lb/>activities. <lb/>The economic agenda involves a range of policies to improve the business environment for the entire private sector. It <lb/>aims to cut substantially the administrative and regulatory burden. In addition, subsidies for innovative activities are largely <lb/>being replaced by tax credits and an investment fund has been created to provide innovation credits and seed capital, mainly <lb/>for starting, innovative and/or rapidly growing SMEs. Moreover, the agenda intends to foster the application of new knowledge <lb/>in products or processes, increase the use of ICT and improve spatial economic conditions for economic clusters (e.g. related <lb/>to the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport), among others. <lb/>For the top sector approach the government has identified nine economic sectors (agro-food, crops, water, high-tech, <lb/>life sciences, chemicals, energy, logistics and the creative industry) plus &quot; headquarters &quot; (for internationally operating firms) as <lb/>key areas of competence, where investments should be prioritised and bottlenecks identified. According to the government, <lb/>these sectors are knowledge intensive, export-oriented, usually with specific legislation and regulation, and could make an <lb/>important contribution to solving societal issues. In total, an annual EUR 1.5 billion (0.2% of GDP) is to be (re-) allocated to <lb/>the top sectors by 2015.To facilitate a demand driven &quot; bottom-up &quot; process, multidisciplinary teams (the so-called &quot; top teams &quot; ) <lb/>were formed for each top sector. The teams include sector experts (typically well-known business figures), a high-ranking civil <lb/>servant, an SME entrepreneur and a representative from a research institution. The tasks of the teams were to identify <lb/>opportunities and challenges for the respective sector and formulate proposals to address sector-specific problems, mainly <lb/>related to research and innovation, foreign policy, sector specific regulation, and education/ human capital. Besides having <lb/>identified sector specific bottlenecks, the teams stressed that some of the challenges ask for (a top sector) overarching <lb/>policies (e.g. related to elements of education, innovation, and availability of risk capital), thereby further shaping the <lb/>economic agenda relevant to the entire private sector. The first interactive phase of establishing objectives and policies has <lb/>mostly been finalised, while implementation is gradually taking place. <lb/>Table 2. <lb/>The main dates in the formulation of the new policies of the business sector <lb/>September 2010 <lb/> <lb/>Coalition agreement stipulates an improvement of the business climate and selects <lb/>nine economic &quot; top sectors &quot; . <lb/>February 2011 <lb/> <lb/>Presentation of general framework by government and announcement of first policies. <lb/>June 2011 <lb/> <lb/> &quot; Top teams &quot; present first proposals and objectives as requested by government. <lb/>September 2011 <lb/> <lb/>Response by government to first proposals and further specification of generic policies. <lb/>January/April 2012 <lb/> <lb/> &quot; Top teams 2.0 &quot; present &quot; innovation contracts &quot; , &quot; human capital &quot; and &quot; internationalisation <lb/>agenda&apos;s &quot; . <lb/>2012 – beyond <lb/> <lb/>Further development and implementation of policies. <lb/>Source: Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation, 2011a; 2011b; 2012. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>An important issue in the literature is to what extent such policies can strengthen the economy. An <lb/>improvement of general framework conditions can foster innovation and productivity performance, <lb/>allowing market forces to shape comparative advantages over time. More controversial is the role for <lb/>targeted intervention supporting specific sectors or activities (Naudé, 2010a). Targeted support could be <lb/>justified by positive externalities (e.g. knowledge spillovers via economic clustering or innovation in clean <lb/>technology), information asymmetries (e.g. leading to capital market imperfections) and coordination <lb/>failures (e.g. lack of coordination between different actors that leads to underinvestment in projects with <lb/>high initial costs) (Rodrik, 2008; Lin and Chang, 2009; Aghion et al., 2011; OECD, 2011a). However, <lb/>targeted support also has potential drawbacks, such as wrong sector selection and rent-seeking behaviour <lb/>from economic agents (Rodrik, 2008; Lin and Chang, 2009; Naudé, 2010a and 2010b). Hence, insofar as <lb/>more targeted interventions are successful in correcting market failures they should benefit the economy, <lb/>though it is a policy challenge to design governance procedures to detect and correct market failures and <lb/>manage vested interests. Moreover, it is important to recall that national economies do not &quot; compete &quot; like <lb/>corporations (Krugman, 1994). If industrial policy succeeds in altering comparative advantages by <lb/>increasing activity in promoted sectors, it will also draw economic resources away from other sectors <lb/>without necessarily boosting overall economic performance. In this respect, a possible pitfall is that <lb/>governments often lack the information and capability to select and promote the sectors that may have a <lb/>latent comparative advantage. <lb/>Targeted policies pose challenges <lb/>While having abandoned old-style industrial policies in the 1980s, the Netherlands is moving to an <lb/>alternative form of targeted support. The rationale is to address market and government failures at the <lb/>sector level for nine areas of expertise as well as to prioritise research and development activities in these <lb/> &quot; top sectors &quot; – i.e. agro-food, crops, water, high-tech, life sciences, chemicals, energy, logistics and the <lb/>creative industry, plus &quot; headquarters &quot; (for internationally operating firms). These failures are particularly a <lb/>limited knowledge transfer from universities, a coordination failure among different branches of the <lb/>government, overly detailed sector regulation, and an insufficiently supply of skilled workers. The <lb/>selection criteria included the sectors that are knowledge-intensive and export-oriented, usually with <lb/>sector-specific regulation, and that can potentially make an important contribution to solving societal <lb/>issues (Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation, 2011b). <lb/>The top sector approach follows up on earlier initiatives -mostly in the area of innovation -that aimed <lb/>to strengthen the competitiveness of roughly the same sectors of the economy (Court of Audit, 2011). <lb/>However, the new approach is to be broader and more integrated, covering different aspects of the business <lb/>environment related to sector specific regulation, innovation, human capital and internationalisation. <lb/>Another important new element is that the private sector has been leading and shaping the new policies. <lb/>This demand driven approach was facilitated by the creation of &quot; top teams &quot; for each sector, which <lb/>typically included a well-known business figure, a high-ranking civil servant, an SME entrepreneur and a <lb/>representative from a research institution. The government asked the teams to identify opportunities and <lb/>challenges for the respective sector and subsequently formulate agendas to address sector-specific <lb/>bottlenecks, notably related to research and innovation, human capital, regulation and internationalisation, <lb/>both at the government level and by the sectors themselves. Moreover, the new approach stipulates a move <lb/>towards more &quot; evidence-based policy making &quot; , by using targets, monitoring and evaluations to guide <lb/>policies in the different top sectors. <lb/>The demand driven process is commendable as it could help address policy makers&apos; information <lb/>constraints. Indeed, to design effective policies governments need to elicit information from the market, <lb/>which often requires close cooperation between different private and (semi) public stakeholders -tough in <lb/>the discussion with the private sector it is a challenge to sufficiently involve SMEs and notably innovative <lb/>start-up firms that may face very different bottlenecks than incumbents (Rodrik, 2008). In addition, the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></note>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>focus on evidence-based policy making is a welcome move as it is key in the design of sound industrial <lb/>policy and likely to support accountability for the successes and failures of it. In this respect, very clear <lb/>criteria for success and features such as conditionality, sunset clauses, programme reviewing, and <lb/>benchmarking should be developed (OECD, 2011a; Rodrik, 2008). <lb/>Gauging the overall size and scope of the selected sectors is difficult as the sectors are not strictly <lb/>defined and sometimes overlap (Koster and Edzes, 2011). In addition, as the individual top sectors are <lb/>relatively broad and often encompass completely different industries (e.g. logistics could include services <lb/>as diverge as road haulage, air transport and taxis to warehousing and packaging), it is unclear to what <lb/>extent all relevant industries are indeed covered and represented by the top sector approach. This <lb/>complicates the linking of instruments and objectives as well as the general move to &quot; evidence-based <lb/>policy making &quot; . Hence, to ensure an efficient use of public funds and enable evidence-based policy making <lb/>by linking instruments and objectives, the scope of the top sectors should become more clearly defined. <lb/>The selected top sectors are to a large extent representing the traditional manufacturing sectors, while <lb/>the presence of services is relatively limited. This seems somewhat counterintuitive given the large <lb/>services content in the economy, their role as an important input for the manufacturing sector and the <lb/>importance of services exports, which make the services sector key to fully reap the benefits from <lb/>globalisation (Figure 8). Hence, as a mean to identify sector bottlenecks and further improve sector <lb/>regulation, the government should consider establishing similar teams (or alike initiatives) for other <lb/>sectors, notably in the service sectors, without necessarily making them top sectors. <lb/>Figure 8. Services exports specialised in professional business, communication as well as royalties¹ <lb/>1. <lb/>The graph shows the relative export specialisation of the Netherlands compared to other OECD countries (for which data are <lb/>available). The RCA (or Balassa) index of revealed comparative advantage is a measure of a country&apos;s export market share of a <lb/>services category compared to the world&apos;s (here OECD) export share of that category. A value above 1 suggests that a country <lb/>is relatively specialised in the category. The bubbles give an indication of the size of the total (OECD) export market: the bigger <lb/>the bubble the bigger the size of the export market. The high value of royalties and license fees is likely to reflect the position of <lb/>the Netherlands as a financial turntable (e.g. the Netherlands has also a high import share in this category). <lb/>2. <lb/>Growth of export market calculated in nominal USD. <lb/>Source: OECD, Trade in services database. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>In addition, to capitalise on new opportunities from globalisation, the top sector approach should <lb/>remain open to accommodate rising sectors or industries in the future, reflecting changes in comparative <lb/>advantage over time. Similarly, the approach should be able to let structurally declining sector go, which <lb/>may be politically more difficult. To this respect, a swift and broad implementation of the planned move <lb/>towards evidence-based policy making would facilitate future sector selection. <lb/>Research and innovation are to be strengthened via &quot; innovation contracts &quot; for the top sectors. The <lb/>contracts are based on public private partnership agreements at the sector level, aiming at reaching a <lb/>balanced mix of fundamental research, applied research and the application of knowledge in private <lb/>activity. The top teams developed different research projects for the innovation contracts that fulfil their <lb/>sector&apos;s need for which about EUR 1 billion of public support was made available from already existing <lb/>(partly from fundamental and applied) research activities. Hence, there are no additional public resources <lb/>available, but part of them is now explicitly allocated to the top sectors and private sector demand is given <lb/>a larger role in the work of the research institutions. Moreover, long-term partnership between industry and <lb/>research bodies within top sectors is promoted via a planned additional tax credit for participation in Top <lb/>Consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs) (Box 3). In the context of scarce public resources, the <lb/>prioritisation of research activities in the areas of the top sectors could be justified, insofar as these <lb/>earmarked activities are to create relatively large positive (knowledge) spillovers. However, the <lb/>government should ensure that the earmarked activities do not become a vehicle for favouring particular <lb/>industries or firms within the different top sectors. A particular concern is that larger firms and existing <lb/>industries are better organised than SMEs and emerging industries, and can thus gain from a &quot; first-mover &quot; <lb/>advantage in dealing with public support schemes. A balanced approach can be achieved by requiring that <lb/>findings from the top teams are backed up by independent evidence and that their policy prescriptions are <lb/>evaluated against alternatives. <lb/>Box 3. Top Consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs) <lb/>The establishment of Top Consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs) is an important element of the <lb/>innovation contracts to secure long-term public-private research cooperation. The TKIs build on already existing <lb/>initiatives in some sectors (i.e. the virtual &quot; Technologische Top Instituten &quot; or Leading Technological Institutes), where <lb/>several research and private parties work on demand driven fundamental and strategic research as well as the <lb/>application of scientific knowledge in processes (see the 2006 Survey for a more detailed description). As the institutes <lb/>are generally considered to successfully foster long-term public-private research cooperation, the idea is to introduce <lb/>similar institutes in other sectors. Being under construction, the exact scope and form of the TKIs is likely to vary <lb/>among the top sectors, while some sectors might have more than one consortium to sufficiently cover sector&apos;s <lb/>activities. <lb/>To foster participation in TKIs, a fiscal incentive on R&amp;D activities is to be put in place as of 2013 (see below), <lb/>and comes on top of the generic tax credits to support R&amp;D. Thereby, the government makes an exception in the <lb/>approach that R&amp;D support should be provided via broad framework conditions. Although the exact format of the tax <lb/>credit has yet to be determined, the government plans to allocate EUR 90 million on an annual basis, which needs to <lb/>benefit enterprises as well as knowledge institutions like universities. The government&apos;s vision is that more than <lb/>EUR 0.5 billion will be involved in the TKIs by 2015, of which at least 40% will be financed by the business sector <lb/>The top teams proposed more plans than are possible with available public funding. The final <lb/>allocation is being partly determined by the private sector&apos;s own contributions (EUR 1 ½ billion, mostly <lb/>based on letters of intent). However, it remains to be seen whether the new approach leads to additional <lb/>private R&amp;D activities. The demand driven approach may encourage companies to provide additional <lb/>funds as research becomes more oriented towards their needs. On the other hand, there is also a risk that <lb/>the new format crowds out current private R&amp;D activities as companies bring in-house research activities <lb/>under the innovation contracts to benefit from associated public support. <lb/></body>

			<body>The top teams also prepared education and training agenda to strengthen the link between education <lb/>and the top sectors&apos; human capital needs (Rae and Sollie, 2008; Baldwin, 2006). The proposed initiatives <lb/>focus on fostering qualification of pupils, life-long learning and linkages between supply and demand of <lb/>human capital. Thereby, the top teams suggested putting stronger (financial) incentives in place to <lb/>stimulate studies that are considered more valuable to the private sector and society (Government, 2012). <lb/>Specifically, there is a strongly perceived shortage of employees with a science and technology <lb/>background – including lower skilled technical staff. However, it is hard to find strong evidence of a skill <lb/>gap in this area (Jacobs and Webbink, 2004; Noailly et al., 2005; De Graaf et al., 2007). For instance, this <lb/>group of workers only have an average entry salary and they have not seen their relative wages increase <lb/>over time despite the decreasing supply of workers in the area of science and technology (Figure 2). In <lb/>addition, more than half of the workers trained in this area work in other economic sectors (Cornet et al., <lb/>2006). These findings suggest that the shortage is smaller than perceived, or impediments in the wage <lb/>formation process that prevent wages to sufficiently reflect relative shortages. <lb/>Advice was also sought from the top teams about how to reduce the regulatory burden at the sector <lb/>level. Such involvement helps to pinpoint market (and government) failures. However, it could also lead to <lb/>regulatory capture and too much heterogeneity in regulation across sectors, making it potentially harder for <lb/>investors, including foreign ones, to identify and comply with Dutch sector regulation. This would weaken <lb/>the positive effects of the attempt to reduce the administrative burden for the entire private sector by 20% <lb/>(see below). For instance, some sectors consider the income threshold to allow foreign qualified workers <lb/>(OECD, 2012) to be too high, thereby acting as a sector specific bottleneck. However, such a bottleneck <lb/>should be addressed at the general level (i.e. not at the sector level) to avoid too much heterogeneity in <lb/>regulation across sectors. Hence, the establishment of the top teams is a welcome move to address sector <lb/>bottlenecks, but it is important this does not lead to unnecessary differences in regulation across sectors. <lb/>Figure 9.

This involves <lb/>activities like trade missions, providing advice and information for doing business abroad as well as <lb/>removing barriers to international trade and investment. Activities in this area are already well established, <lb/>but the new approach gives more attention to establishing business links with (larger) emerging economies <lb/>(with again a focus on the nine top sectors), increasing the number of internationally operating SMEs, and <lb/>attracting (high-tech) FDI from emerging markets (Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and <lb/></body>

			<body>Innovation, 2011a, 2011b and 2011c). 10 Foreign representations are mobilised to support internationally <lb/>operating firms. Most services are provided at a fraction of provision costs, though at times a private <lb/>contribution in the order of EUR 250-500 is in place. <lb/>The rationale for economic diplomacy is the existence of market failures, e.g. related to positive <lb/>international knowledge spillovers, incomplete markets or enforceability of property rights (Harris and Li, <lb/>2005; Veenstra et al., 2010). Indeed, doing business in emerging markets is complicated by linguistic, <lb/>cultural, bureaucratic and political issues, explaining why exporting firms often move slowly to the most <lb/>distant markets (Creusen and Lejour, 2011). In addition, firms are subject to information problems. This <lb/>concerns particularly SMEs, as they tend to have relatively small information-networks and gathering <lb/>capacity (Figure 10). For the Netherlands, empirical work points to economic diplomacy as an effective <lb/>tool to remove impediments to international trade and investment (e.g. Van den Berg et al., 2008; Creusen <lb/>and Lejour, 2011; Moons and Van Bergeijk, 2011). 11 <lb/>Figure 10. High explicit barriers to trade and investment in emerging markets <lb/>From 0 least restrictive to 6 most restrictive, 2008¹ <lb/>1. <lb/>IND refers to India and IDN to Indonesia. <lb/>Source: OECD (2012), International Trade and Commodities Statistics database. <lb/>The increased emphasis on economic diplomacy, notably on doing business with emerging markets, is <lb/>likely to support trade and investment linkages with the increasingly important players in the world market. <lb/>However, Dutch exports are concentrated in a small number of larger firms that can generally enter and <lb/>expand in foreign markets without specific government support. Hence, economic diplomacy efforts that <lb/>support these firms could displace similar private efforts without boosting internationalisation. In addition, <lb/>this is an area where developing evidence to form policy is important, as little is known about the cost-<lb/>efficiency of the different elements that support the internationalisation of firms. In any case, to secure the <lb/>cost-efficient use of scarce public resources, it is important that the prices for these services reflect some of <lb/>the costs. For example, the Danish Trade Council&apos;s hourly charge is EUR 120 and the council is subject to <lb/>10. <lb/>Furthermore, part of the programs for international development cooperation will be linked to the areas of <lb/>the top sectors. <lb/>11. <lb/>However, some instruments appear to be more effective than others. For instance, the presence of <lb/>embassies and high level trade missions appear to create stronger results than other policy instruments. <lb/></body>

			<body>a cost coverage target of 25%, which together with customer satisfaction evaluations aims at securing <lb/>relatively efficient demand driven activities. 12 <lb/>Improving framework conditions should be key <lb/>Over the last two decades, the main focus of industrial policy in the Netherlands has been the <lb/>improvement of framework conditions, which is reflected in low barriers to entrepreneurship (Wölfl et al., <lb/>2009; and WEF, 2011). However, weaknesses remain in the Netherlands&apos; ability to respond to <lb/>globalisation. These include the relatively low innovation activity, the limited number of fast growing <lb/>innovative SMEs and entry and exit barriers that hamper economic growth via the process of &quot; creative <lb/>destruction &quot; . The government intends to improve framework conditions for the entire private sector via the <lb/>economic agenda part of the new policies for the business sector. <lb/>Public expenses on stimulating R&amp;D is projected to increase from EUR 3.2 billon (0.5% of GDP) in <lb/>2008 to about 4 billion in 2015 (0.6% of GDP) (Ministry of EL&amp;I, 2011d). 13 To increase innovative <lb/>activities, various direct innovation subsidies will be replaced by R&amp;D tax incentives. The fiscal costs of <lb/>the tax incentives are projected to more than double over the government&apos;s term, partly reflecting the <lb/>doubling in the number of schemes (Table 3). These costs are partly offset by lower direct subsidies to <lb/>innovation and lower spending on applied research institutions. Another important element of the adjusted <lb/>innovation framework is the stronger focus on &quot; evidence-based &quot; policy, which follows up on the 2006 <lb/>Survey recommendation, to enable evaluation of policies. Implementing such monitoring and measuring <lb/>the effects of innovation policies is difficult, but at least the establishment of some indicators and <lb/>individual targets per policy instrument could better guide innovation policies. <lb/>The policy shift towards tax incentives and evidence-based innovation policy may improve the <lb/>business environment, make innovation policies simpler and strengthen policy guidance. The shift could <lb/>make the system more effective, as empirical studies show that tax incentives tend to have a relatively <lb/>higher impact on private innovation than direct R&amp;D subsidies, although at the cost of subsidising <lb/>activities that would have been undertaken anyway (Jaumotte and Pain, 2005; OECD, 2010a) (Box 1.4). <lb/>Tax incentives have the advantage that they can potentially benefit all firms, reduce the temptation to &quot; pick <lb/>winners &quot; and are more flexibility regarding the range of R&amp;D activities undertaken (OECD, 2006a). 14 <lb/>Additionally, in the context of the growing internalisation of R&amp;D activities, stronger tax incentives might <lb/>also attract R&amp;D activities of multinationals. 15 Finally, the new innovation policy reduces the strong focus <lb/>on SMEs, which used to receive five times more direct subsidies per invested R&amp;D euro than larger firms, <lb/>despite the lack of a correspondingly sized market failure to justify such a strong focus (Government, <lb/>2010; CPB, 2010) (Figures 11 and 12). <lb/>12. <lb/>Some (basic information) services are free of charge, or against discount rates (usually applied to SMEs <lb/>with fewer than 50 employees and with a maximum annual turnover of less than DKK 50 million). <lb/>13. <lb/>Spending of central government, i.e. excluding local governments. <lb/>14. <lb/>In general, R&amp;D tax incentives are found to contribute to R&amp;D investment, innovation output and welfare <lb/>in a country, although the responsiveness is greater in the long run and the empirical evidence is scattered <lb/>(OECD, 2011b). <lb/>15. <lb/>Although other factors such as market access and the country&apos;s knowledge base tend to be more important <lb/>(OECD, 2011b). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 4. The design of R&amp;D tax credits <lb/>R&amp;D tax credits can be part of a balanced policy mix to increase innovation. Their benefit relatively to direct <lb/>R&amp;D subsidies is that they can potentially benefit all R&amp;D activities, ensuring a more market-based selection of <lb/>research projects. On the other hand, tax credits are not targeted, which means that the government cannot use such <lb/>credits to steer research resources into areas with (perceived) high social returns. Moreover, tax credits involve <lb/>significant deadweight losses in the sense that they notably support research projects that would have been <lb/>undertaken anyway. Finally, tax credits tend to benefit incumbent firms more than young SMEs, which often lack <lb/>taxable income to take advantages of tax reliefs. <lb/>The deadweight loss could be partly addressed by making R&amp;D tax incentives incremental, i.e. being based on <lb/>the increase in R&amp;D activity, rather than volume based (applied to all R&amp;D spending). For instance, combining volume <lb/>and incremental tax incentives would support the level of R&amp;D investment and reward higher investment growth. <lb/>However, incremental-based support systems are relatively complex to design and implement: a reason why most <lb/>OECD countries are moving towards volume-based incentive schemes. <lb/>Source: OECD (2011b), Criscuolo et al.

			<body>Dutch innovation policies have often shifted over time. For example, the 2006 Economic Survey <lb/>reported a shift from generic towards more specific support for business R&amp;D – an approach that is now <lb/>being reversed. Such policy volatility may damage R&amp;D activity since expectations that R&amp;D incentives <lb/>are permanent should strengthen R&amp;D investment (Guellec and Van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2003). <lb/>This point to the need for long-term political commitment to the new R&amp;D support framework. By the <lb/>same token, the new policy increases the number of R&amp;D tax incentives from two to four, possibly raising <lb/>company transaction costs and increasing overlap and interaction between the schemes. Hence, the policy <lb/>framework could be further broadened by reducing the number of R&amp;D tax credits. <lb/>The government&apos;s ambitious goal to boost R&amp;D spending from 1.8% to 2.5% of GDP depends <lb/>strongly on raising private sector spending, given that public spending is to remain broadly stable in <lb/>relation to GDP. The policy goal might gradually become more difficult to attain over time as the services <lb/>content of the economy is likely to increase further, as the R&amp;D intensity of the services sector is relatively <lb/>low. It should also be noted that the new innovation framework is focussing on &quot; traditional &quot; R&amp;D <lb/>activities, such as science and technology research. However, globalisation is likely to increase the value of <lb/>investing in other innovative activities, such as new approaches to design, databases, marketing and <lb/>organisational structures (OECD, 2010b; OECD, 2011c). In fact, investment in such intangible assets is <lb/>likely to become increasingly important for service-oriented economies. <lb/>To complement the innovation policy approach, the 2006 Economic Survey showed that business <lb/>application of new knowledge is only average, notwithstanding a very strong research system (Figure 13). <lb/>The government intends to make greater use of private demand to direct university research by allocating <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2.5% of public research funds to convert knowledge into applied innovations and by strengthening the <lb/>monitoring of the application of public knowledge. However, while an agreement for this purpose between <lb/>the government and the universities has been outlined, university staff has few personal financial <lb/>incentives (e.g. in salary scales or shared patent rights) to cooperate with firms on innovation projects. As <lb/>stressed in the 2006 Survey such incentives are important to strengthen science-business linkages. Hence, <lb/>to enhance researchers&apos; incentives to market the results of their research, clear and more generous rules for <lb/>sharing patent rights should be established. <lb/>Structural funding bottlenecks for young innovative and fast growing SMEs hamper innovation and <lb/>growth (Boot and Schmeits, 2004; Ministry of EL&amp;I, 2011e; AWT, 2011). As in other OECD countries, <lb/>these issues are mostly related to information problems -on the part of the entrepreneur or among the <lb/>financers of innovative SMEs -as well as the dominance of traditional banking finance in the Netherlands <lb/>(OECD, 2006b). Consequently, these SMEs have limited access to risk capital. The associated restricted <lb/>growth of innovative SMEs means that the economy is not fully capitalising on this important driver of <lb/>employment creation and productivity growth (OECD, 2010d; AWT, 2011; Bos and Stam, 2011). <lb/>Moreover, young innovative SMEs have a higher probability to come up with radical innovations <lb/>contributing to the process of &quot; creative destruction &quot; (Stam and Gerritsen, 2009). <lb/>The government is creating a new SME+ Innovation fund to back innovative and fast growing SMEs <lb/>as an umbrella for different (partly existing) finance schemes in this area (Ministry of EL&amp;I, 2011a and <lb/>2011b). This fund aims at avoiding interferences in the segments of the private market that work <lb/>appropriately. The fund, with an annual budget of EUR 120 million, has three pillars. The first is direct <lb/>credits for R&amp;D projects, which are converted into subsidies in the case of project failure. The second and <lb/>third pillars concern respectively early-stage and later-stage capital and notably take the form of public <lb/>participation in investment funds (via public-private investment funds as well as a &quot; fund of funds &quot; ). The <lb/>aim is to mobilise private capital to close a perceived equity gap for investments of between EUR 0.2 and <lb/>3 million. The SME+ fund is designed as a &quot; revolving fund &quot; , where on average about 80% of the invested <lb/>money should return for new investments. It is open to the entire private sector, though part of its spending <lb/>is earmarked for the top sector &quot; creative industry&quot;. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></note>

Excellent research system but mediocre business linkages <lb/>The scale of the indicator is 0-1, from lowest maximum possible performance <lb/>1. <lb/>Linkages and entrepreneurship concerns the items: Public-private co-publications per million population.

Indeed, venture capitalists bring sector specific knowledge, access to relevant networks and may <lb/>help raising additional financing at a later stage (Boot and Schmeits, 2004; Da Rin et al., 2005). Moreover, <lb/>the fund is complementary to the innovation tax credits, which benefit relatively less to young innovative <lb/>SMEs (as these firms often lack taxable income). However, there are several risks to the approach. First, <lb/>the targeted recovery rate on investments (80%) risks leading the SME+ fund to avoid financing the most <lb/>risky projects, even though these projects are potentially the most radically innovative. There is also a risk <lb/>of crowding out private financing for the less risky projects. Another potential issue with the target <lb/>recovery rate is that assessing returns on investment takes time, as investments from private venture capital <lb/>funds typically take 5 to 10 years to materialise (Lerner, 2009; Murray and Lingelbach, 2009; Nesta, <lb/>2009). Moreover, there can be an issue of potentially &quot; over-engineering &quot; of the venture capital market, <lb/>where public programmes could create artificial funding barrier between successive phases of the <lb/>development of the company that requires an evolving funding process (Lerner, 2009; Nesta, 2009). <lb/>Finally, deviations from the fund&apos;s generic nature – like the earmarked funding for the &quot; creative <lb/>industry &quot; – risk hindering strict project selection. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 14. Venture capital market is relatively small <lb/>Venture capital as a percentage of GDP, 2009 <lb/>Source: OECD (2011), Entrepreneurship at a Glance. <lb/>Greater emphasis on competition policy is an area where policies to improve the business <lb/>environment could be broadened. A robust competition framework supports entrepreneurship and an <lb/>efficient allocation of production, and may strengthen possible positive effects of more targeted support as <lb/>well as innovation (Jaumotte and Pain, 2005; OECD, 2010d; Aghion et al., 2011). In the Netherlands, <lb/>unnecessarily high regulatory barriers still harm competition by discouraging new firms from entering <lb/>markets, notwithstanding the relaxation of barriers to entrepreneurship since the mid 1990s (Kocsis et al., <lb/>2009). Monetary costs of starting a business and the time delay caused by entry regulations are associated <lb/>with lower entry rates (Fisman and Sarria-Allende, 2009; Klapper et al., 2006; Ciccone and Papaioannou, <lb/>2007). Against this backdrop, the planned further reduction in red tape is a welcome move (Box 5) <lb/>(Figure 15). Moreover, a number of network and services sectors, like retail distribution, legal services, <lb/>accounting and road freight business, remain relatively sheltered from entry (Figure 16), while <lb/>concentration in some sectors, such as financial and telecommunication services, is quite high. Likewise, <lb/>streamlining exit procedures could further facilitate the process of creative destruction. As covered in the <lb/>2006 Survey, bankruptcy procedures in the Netherlands remain long and costly, pointing to a need for <lb/>reform. Hence, the new policies for the business sector should be broadened by giving greater attention to <lb/>competition policies, in particular to lower entry and exit barriers. <lb/>Box 5. Reducing red tape <lb/>The economic agenda has ambitious targets to reduce the administrative burden for businesses (Ministry of <lb/>EL&amp;I, 2011a). Based on Standard Cost Model calculations – a method for measuring and pricing the administrative <lb/>burden imposed by regulation by assessing time spend on compliance – the burden has to decrease by 10% in 2012 <lb/>(compared to 2010) and by an annual 5% in the years after. The targets are a continuation of the significant reductions <lb/>of administrative burdens over the latest decade (OECD, 2010c). Besides cutting red tape, the government aims at <lb/>reducing compliance and supervisory costs as well as improving government services. The specific measures include <lb/>simplifying payroll taxes, reducing bureaucracy formalities for starting limited private companies, scrapping chambers <lb/>of commerce levies, lowering reporting requirements (such as tax returns and financial statements), creating an <lb/>administrative &quot; one-stop-shop &quot; for all entrepreneurs and reducing inspection for companies that consistently comply <lb/>with existing rules. Better regulation is an important contribution to improve broad framework conditions. <lb/></body>

However, business <lb/>policies cannot be a standalone measure, particularly if the Netherlands is to reach the government&apos;s <lb/>ambition of becoming one of the top five knowledge economies by 2020 (see Box. 2). Surveys notably <lb/>point to problems with the labour market and tax issues (Table 4; OECD, 2012), areas that receive far less <lb/>attention in the new policies for the business sector. Reforms that increase the flexibility of the Dutch <lb/>labour market would be complementary to the new business policy, as such reforms are likely to foster <lb/>innovative activities and the diffusion of knowledge (Bovenberg and Theeuwes, 2004). High-risk <lb/>innovative sectors tend to be smaller in countries, like the Netherlands, with strict employment protection <lb/>legislation (Bartelsman et al., 2010). Also, more flexible labour markets lower the necessary wage <lb/>premium to attract high skilled workers to fast growing sectors (Van Ark et al., 2009). A related issue is <lb/>that there are relatively few &quot; growth-oriented &quot; innovative SMEs in the Netherlands; an observation that is <lb/>in part linked to labour market rigidities and the high protection of workers (e.g. Stam and Gerritsen, 2009; <lb/>OECD 2010d; AWT, 2011) (Figure 17). Hence, the policies to improve the business sector environment <lb/>should be backed by reforms that address labour market rigidities. <lb/></body>

Recommendations to strengthen the business environment <lb/>Broaden targeted support to different sectors <lb/> The scope of the top sectors should be more clearly defined in order to ensure an efficient use of public <lb/>funds and enable evidence-based policy making. <lb/> To take full advantage of the top team approach to improve sector regulation, similar teams should be <lb/>created for more sectors of the economy, especially services. <lb/> The government should ensure that the funds earmarked to top sectors in the area of research do not <lb/>become a vehicle for favouring particular firms, especially as incumbents may benefit from a first mover <lb/>advantage. <lb/> The top sector approach should remain open to future emerging sectors and industries as well as to let any <lb/>declining ones go. A swift and broad implementation of the planned move towards evidence-based <lb/>policy-making would facilitate future sector selection. <lb/> Regarding economic diplomacy, the public services offered should reflect at least some of the costs, in <lb/>order to secure the cost-efficient use of scarce public resources. <lb/>Further enhance framework conditions <lb/> The stability of the new R&amp;D support framework should be backed by long-term political commitment to <lb/>support firms&apos; multi-year research programmes. <lb/> The R&amp;D support framework should be simplified by reducing the number of tax credits. <lb/> To strengthen the relatively weak science-business linkages, researchers&apos; incentives to market the results of <lb/>their research should be enhanced by establishing clear and more generous rules for sharing patents rights. <lb/> The government should further promote framework conditions by giving greater attention to competition <lb/>policies. In particular, lower entry and exit barriers will support the process of &quot; creative destruction &quot; . <lb/> The policies to improve the business sector environment should be backed by reforms that address labour <lb/>market rigidities. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)3 <lb/></body>
