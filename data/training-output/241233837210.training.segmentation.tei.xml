			<body>PREFACE <lb/>Private banks are key actors in economic development. They can also be key actors in <lb/>political development. Private capital movements have risen over the past few decades and bank <lb/>flows have contributed heavily. <lb/>In the context of its activities on Financing for Development, the OECD Development <lb/>Centre monitors these trends and maps both official and private flows to developing countries <lb/>and emerging economies. This paper is part of that effort; at the same time it goes much further <lb/>to examine whether and, if so, why, banks like to lend to new emerging democracies. Much <lb/>attention has been paid in academic literature and policy debates to banks&apos; role in economic <lb/>development; little attention has been given, however, to banks&apos; political preferences and their <lb/>role in political development. This paper begins to fill that gap. <lb/>Using panel data on 29 countries for the period 1984-2004, the authors find that bank <lb/>lending correlates positively with levels of democratisation as measured by different indicators; <lb/>relative stability of economic policy also seems to spur financial inflows. On the contrary, <lb/>frequent cabinet turnovers do not seem to be important determining factors of banks&apos; lending <lb/>behaviour. <lb/>These findings have direct implications for policy making: the market seems to reward <lb/>democratic transitions and policy stability. Democratisation and political development seem to <lb/>spur increased private flows and contribute to economic development. <lb/>Prof. Louka T.

Les flux bancaires ont pris part à cette dynamique. Néanmoins, excepté quelques rare <lb/>travaux empiriques, peu de travaux ont été consacrés aux facteurs politiques expliquant cet <lb/>essor, et encore moins de recherche a été dédiée à l&apos;économie politique des flux bancaires privés. <lb/>Le travail présenté aborde cette question en croisant une série d&apos;indicateurs sur la démocratie, <lb/>l&apos;incertitude et la stabilité politique, avec les séries de flux bancaires développés par la Banque <lb/>des Règlements Internationaux (BRI). Il propose une économie politique des flux privés <lb/>bancaires internationaux en abordant deux questions : les banques préfèrent-elles la démocratie ? <lb/>Tendent-elles à primer les transitions démocratiques, la stabilité des politiques publiques et la <lb/>stabilité politique ? Un des résultats les plus intéressants du travail présenté est de corroborer <lb/>que les facteurs politiques importent pour les banques internationales. Celles-ci tendent en <lb/>particulier à augmenter leurs prêts internationaux dans les trois années qui suivent une <lb/>transition démocratique. Cette tendance est particulièrement prégnante en Amérique latine où, <lb/>pays vers lesquels les opérations de crédit bancaire internationale ont augmenté avec l&apos;essor de la <lb/>démocratie. <lb/></body>

			<front>© OECD 2007 <lb/>7 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Private capital movements have risen in recent decades, and bank flows have been part of <lb/>this story. Some empirical studies have analysed the political drivers of private international <lb/>liquidity, but paradoxically very few have looked at the political economy of bank flows. Even <lb/>less research exists on the role of politics in explaining cross-border banking movements towards <lb/>emerging democracies. The present study links compiled indicators on democracy, policy <lb/>uncertainty and political stability to international bank lending flows from data developed by the <lb/>BIS. It provides an empirical investigation of the political economy of cross-border bank flows to <lb/>emerging markets and tries to answer two questions. Do bankers tend to prefer emerging <lb/>democracies? Do they reward democratic transitions as well as policy and political stability? One <lb/>of the major findings is that politics do matter, and international banks tend to have political <lb/>preferences; annual growth in bank flows usually booms in the three years following a <lb/>democratic transition, especially in Latin America. <lb/>JEL Classification: F34, F21, G21, K00 <lb/>Keywords: capital flows, banks, democracy and emerging markets. <lb/>Banking on Democracy: The Political Economy of International Private Bank Lending in Emerging Markets <lb/>DEV/DOC(2007)2 <lb/>8 <lb/>© OECD 2007 <lb/></front>

			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Wall Street and the City have begun to take a fresh look at emerging markets. During the <lb/>1990s, financial and economic variables dominated their analysis. Since 2000, political and ethical <lb/>variables have become increasingly relevant. Examples of this interest abound. In 2004 the <lb/>research firm Innovest Strategic Value Advisors and emerging market specialist Rexiter Capital <lb/>Management launched the world&apos;s first &quot; sustainability &quot; investment strategy exclusively focused <lb/>on emerging markets 1 . The major investor of the fund created — the large Dutch pension fund <lb/>ABP — looked for a range of products combining the benefits of the potential performance of <lb/>emerging markets with its own interest in sustainability and governance issues such as climate <lb/>change and human rights. By the end of 2004, a group of leading UK-based investors, which <lb/>manages a combined €330 billion, had set aside a specific portion of its commission budget to <lb/>reward broker research on extra-financial areas such as governance and labour relations. A few <lb/>weeks later, the Norwegian government established ethical guidelines for its huge Oil Petroleum <lb/>Fund 2 . <lb/>These examples followed the increasing interest of pension funds such as Calpers — a <lb/>major US pension fund with nearly $170 billion of assets under management in 2005, which <lb/>started to invest in emerging markets in 2000 — in considering non-financial criteria such as <lb/>political stability, transparency and labour rights (along with four other more traditional <lb/>financial criteria). An effect of this approach has been an improvement in ratings, with the scores <lb/>of the 27 countries included in the Calpers financial screening improving on average. Among <lb/>them, Morocco, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Jordan, all of which were excluded from the list of <lb/>countries suitable for investment in 2002, topped the list for country improvements in 2003 <lb/>3 . <lb/>When excluded from foreign investment, emerging-market countries tend to improve their <lb/>governance practices and standards in order to attract investment 4 . <lb/>Like asset managers, bankers also increasingly take into account other variables to assess <lb/>their investment decisions around the world. In 2003, a leading group of top global bankers <lb/>launched the Equator Principles, an unprecedented initiative led by ten of the world&apos;s largest <lb/>1. <lb/>See http://www.rexiter.co.uk/ <lb/>2. <lb/>See http://www.norges-bank.no/english/petroleum_fund/ <lb/>3. <lb/>See Hebb and Wojcik (2004). See also for socially responsible investments in emerging markets, Chan-<lb/>Lau <lb/>(2004), <lb/>Calpers&apos; <lb/>website: <lb/>http://www.calpers.ca.gov/ <lb/>and <lb/>Wilshire <lb/>Associates: <lb/>http://www.wilshire.com/ <lb/>4 . In equity markets most of the variation in governance ratings across firms in developing economies is <lb/>attributable to sovereign country characteristics rather than firm characteristics (Doidge et al., 2004). <lb/></body>

			<body>banks to address the social and environmental impact of the projects that they finance 5 . Since <lb/>then, all the big names in project finance (41 by mid-2006) have signed up for this series of <lb/>guidelines for assessing their project finance deals based on those used by the International <lb/>Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank&apos;s private financing arm. Banks with such impeccably <lb/>capitalist credentials as Citibank, BBVA, ABN Amro or HSBC are all lining up to prove that their <lb/>operations can measure up on sustainability goals. In 2006, a new revised set of guidelines <lb/>(Equator II) was approved, expanding requirements for labour conditions, community health, <lb/>safety and security. <lb/>The financial sector has also increasingly scrutinised human rights issues, mainly a focus <lb/>of industrial companies 6 in the past 7 . Because banks face growing scrutiny from NGOs for their <lb/>role in financial projects that might involve such issues, they can no longer afford to be perceived <lb/>as complicit in ethical and environmental abuses of their customers. Institutional investors, <lb/>particularly those involved in active management and socially responsible funds, ask more <lb/>questions about political governance and human rights, and both issues are on the agendas of <lb/>bankers. Litigation risks have also risen, as exemplified by claims for more than $100 billion <lb/>faced in the United States in 2003 by more than 30 of the world&apos;s leading international banks and <lb/>corporations for their role in supporting apartheid in South Africa. The US lawyer Ed Flagan <lb/>became famous for suing Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust survivors. <lb/>The financial sector has witnessed a proliferation of initiatives, mostly voluntary. They <lb/>include among others the 160 financial institutions that are part of the UNEP FI; the 2 300 <lb/>business finance and non-commercial participants in the UNG Global Compact; the OECD <lb/>Guidelines for Multinationals Enterprises; the 41 major banks and export credit agencies that <lb/>have adopted the initial Equator Principles; the many FTSE and Fortune 500 pension funds and <lb/>asset managers that have incorporated environmental, social, governance and human-rights <lb/>issues into their investment mandates; and the principles of responsible investment launched in <lb/>2006 by the UNEPD FI Asset Management. <lb/>At the same time, foreign banks rush towards China. By mid-2005, the Royal Bank of <lb/>Scotland, together with Merrill Lynch and a Hong-Kong based tycoon, secured a deal of <lb/>$3.1 billion for a 10 per cent stake in the Bank of China. The previous year, another UK bank, <lb/>HSBC, paid $1.7 billion for a 20 per cent stake in Bank of Communications. Later Bank of <lb/>America struck a $3 billion deal for 9 per cent of China Construction Bank while Goldman Sachs, <lb/>Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, ING, Credit Suisse, and many other investment and commercial <lb/>5. <lb/>See http://www.equator-principles.com/.

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>operations keep flying every month towards the new frontier of capitalism. The enthusiasm of <lb/>international lenders for diving into the deep waters of China&apos;s high-growth and high-risk banks <lb/>remains hard to fathom. It is based mainly on a conventional, rose-tinted view of China, still <lb/>underdeveloped but with a huge population, and it pays little heed to the political regime. <lb/>Lured by a huge market economy and &quot; efficient &quot; corruption in the spirit of Shleifer and <lb/>Vishny (1994), FDI runs as high as $60 billion a year, with banks a part of the rush towards the <lb/>Chinese gold mines. Most mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by foreigners have involved buying <lb/>minority stakes in state firms, mainly China&apos;s banks. Goldman Sachs, UBS, Bank of America, <lb/>HSBC, Citigroup and others have spent more than $10 billion on holdings of less than 10 per cent <lb/>in the country&apos;s three major banks. So far China has collected more than $20 billion for stakes in <lb/>banks, investment boutiques and fund-management companies. <lb/>Nevertheless, a new agenda clearly is emerging for private international banks. Political <lb/>issues such as human rights do appear on their radar screens. But what about democracy? What <lb/>about political regimes? Do private banks take them into account in decisions on whether to <lb/>invest in a country? Put another way, do they have political preferences? The Chinese rush might <lb/>suggest a mixed answer, but this paper will show that banks tend to love democracies more than <lb/>initially suspected, particularly emerging ones (an argument that remains to be tested once <lb/>China experiences a democratic transition). <lb/>Private capital movements have risen in recent decades, and bank flows have been part of <lb/>this story. Academics and policy makers have seen such movements as both panacea and <lb/>anathema. Some empirical studies have analysed their political drivers, but paradoxically very <lb/>few have looked at the political economy of banking. Hardly any research exists on the role of <lb/>politics in explaining cross-border banking movements. Bankers&apos; democratic preferences are <lb/>particularly under-researched. We need to know more about banks&apos; political preferences and <lb/>their potential impact on both economic and political development. <lb/>This paper focuses only on the specific set of private flows involved in cross-border <lb/>lending by international banks. The questions raised are narrow. Do banks react positively <lb/>(i.e. with increased lending) when an emerging democracy appears? Do they do so after <lb/>democratic transitions? Is there any relation between democratic consolidation and bank <lb/>lending? Separate studies (the work presented here is part of a larger project on the political <lb/>economy of private capital flows) examine political preferences in other types of capital <lb/>movements. Neut and Santiso (2006) look at foreign direct investors. Nieto and Santiso (2007) <lb/>study the political economy of portfolio investment. Together, these papers thus cover the three <lb/>major types of private capital flows: bank flows, FDI and portfolio flows. <lb/>The issue is not whether private banks prefer democracies worldwide but whether they <lb/>contribute to political development by lending to emerging democracies. Their overall <lb/>democratic preferences emerge quickly from a look at cross-border banking claims. By the end of <lb/>2005, the stock of cross-border claims of Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reporting banks <lb/>was $21 450 billion (BIS, 2006), with most of the claims directed to developed OECD economies, <lb/>all democracies. Only $2 396 billion, less than 11 per cent of the total, went to emerging market <lb/>economies, with most of that to emerging democracies like South Korea, Brazil and Mexico. <lb/></body>

			<body>China concentrates a stock of only $114.6 billion in cross-border bank claims, less than 0.53 per <lb/>cent of the world stock. Banks therefore clearly prefer lending (more than 99 per cent of their <lb/>claims) to democracies 8 . This is not surprising or new information. It is more interesting to look <lb/>at whether banks tend to prefer lending to new, emerging democracies. Do they react to <lb/>democratic transitions and are they sensitive, once transition is achieved, to democratic <lb/>consolidation? Much research has covered the contribution of banking to economic development <lb/>but none has focused on how bank lending affects political development. <lb/>This study uses newly compiled sets of indicators on democracy, political stability and <lb/>policy certainty, linking these datasets with international banking flow data developed by the <lb/>BIS. This allows empirical investigation of the political economy of cross-border bank flows in <lb/>emerging markets and thus a contribution to the rapidly growing literature on the determinants <lb/>of international private capital flows and the overall analysis of the political preferences of <lb/>bankers regarding democracy. <lb/>The paper proceeds as follows. It first reviews the literature on the issue and develops a <lb/>theoretical argument on why banks should prefer emerging democracies. It then focuses on the <lb/>political economy of bank flows to emerging markets in order to gauge whether bankers have a <lb/>political regime preference. It also specifically discusses banking activity in Latin America, a <lb/>region where democratic transitions have been very dense, and rival political hypotheses such as <lb/>the influence of policy instability. The theme &quot; banking on democracy &quot; underlines the importance <lb/>of banks in not only economic but also political development 9 . <lb/>8. <lb/>In terms of bank assets the picture does not change; bank assets vis-à-vis developed OECD countries <lb/>account for 37 per cent of world GDP and those vis-à-vis emerging economies for less than 3 per cent. <lb/>9. <lb/> &quot; Banking on Democracy &quot; was first used as a title in an influential paper by John Freeman (1990). <lb/>Freeman&apos;s paper dealt with a very different set of issues, however. It discussed mainly the relationship <lb/>between international financial flows in general and political sovereignty. <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>II. THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BANK FLOWS IN EMERGING <lb/>MARKETS: A REVIEW <lb/>Private capital flows towards emerging economies have surged in recent decades, far <lb/>surpassing public official flows. The paradox is that until recently little empirical research has <lb/>analysed the drivers of this global private liquidity (Stein and Daude, 2001 and 2004; Levy-Yeyati <lb/>et al., 2003; Mody et al., 2003; Santiso, 2003; Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor, 2004). This is <lb/>particularly true for private international bank activity (Sapienza, 2004). Although some surveys <lb/>examine the factors behind international banks&apos; decisions to establish operations overseas, <lb/>especially in developing countries (Galindo et al., 2003; Buch, 2003; Wezel, 2004) and the <lb/>economic determinants of cross-border claims (Buch and Lipponer, 2004), studies have not <lb/>focused on political variables and institutions that might explain cross-border bank movements. <lb/>Much more research has covered the economic impact of private bank flows. Recent <lb/>empirical studies, for example, have emphasised that banking liquidity has a positive effect on <lb/>economic growth (for a review see Levine, 2004). Other studies have highlighted that capital <lb/>inflows are not risk-free assets and have shown a strong relation between the volume of capital <lb/>movements — bank flows included — and some recent financial crises characterised by sudden <lb/>crashes and highly dollarised economies (Van Rijckeghem and Weder, 2003; Calvo et al., 2004; <lb/>Eichengreen and Hausmann, 2005). <lb/>The institutional and political environment nevertheless can strongly influence <lb/>international capital transactions. Scholars have growing interest in how strongly law and <lb/>politics are key drivers of international private capital flows (Rajan and Zingales, 2003) and <lb/>financial crises (Santiso, 2006; Martínez and Santiso, 2003; Stein and Streb, 2004; Whitehead, <lb/>2004). Both portfolio and foreign direct investment in emerging countries are sensitive to political <lb/>variables (Nieto and Santiso, 2007; Neut and Santiso, 2006). Empirical studies have highlighted <lb/>that corruption exerts a distortionary influence on growth and FDI (Mauro, 1995; Wei, 2000a; <lb/>Wei, 2000b). The quality of legal systems has a strong impact on financial development (Djankov <lb/>et al., 2003) and particularly on M&amp;A (Rossi and Volpin, 2005) and project finance deals (Esty and <lb/>Megginson, 2003). <lb/>The Lucas paradox — i.e. that in theory capital should flow from rich to poor countries, <lb/>but in practice it does not (Lucas, 1990) — has been explained as resulting from institutional <lb/>quality (or lack of it). Empirical evidence for 1971-1998, based on cross-country regressions using <lb/>a sample of 50 countries, shows that the most important variables in explaining the paradox are <lb/>secure property rights and non-corrupt governments (Alfaro et al., 2003). Another study (Alfaro <lb/>et al., 2005) confirms these findings, showing that the historical determinants of institutional <lb/></body>

			<body>quality had a direct effect on private capital flows during 1970-2000. Good institutions and/or <lb/>bad monetary policies are also important in explaining the high volatility of capital flows during <lb/>that period. A country that improves its institutional framework and increases its growth will <lb/>receive more private capital flows. Countries that have better institutional quality and lower <lb/>policy volatility will receive more stable capital flows. Countries with lower inflation volatility <lb/>tend to experience less uncertainty in terms of capital inflows. For FDI, empirical evidence <lb/>suggests that political variables are important and that multinational firms prefer to invest in <lb/>democracies 10 . In sharp contrast with official development assistance by Western governments, <lb/>which registered negative net flows to newly democratic regimes in the three years after <lb/>transition, private direct investors significantly increased FDI in the three years following shifts <lb/>to democratic rule in 23 countries since the mid-1970s (Pei and Lyon, 2003) 11 . <lb/>Politics also matter for the more direct impact on banking dynamics. Governments are <lb/>not disinterested parties in financial systems. They set the rules of the game and the security of <lb/>financial contracts, for example. World history is full of examples of the strong links between <lb/>political institutions and the development of financial systems, as highlighted by neo-<lb/>institutionalist economists and historians. The decision to privatise banks is highly political <lb/>(Clarke et al., 2004), and in emerging economies, public or private bank ownership matters for <lb/>performance; politics interfere with banking performance (Micco, Panizza and Yañez, 2005). <lb/>Another recent empirical analysis uses quarterly data on gross bilateral private banking <lb/>transactions between 19 source and 51 recipient countries from the mid-1980s until 2002 and <lb/>employs various panel methodologies. It highlights politics and institutions as key determinants <lb/>of international private banking activities (Papaioannou, 2004). This research, including not only <lb/>inter-bank loans but also significant amounts of portfolio and FDI flows related to bank activity, <lb/>shows that a fall of 5 per cent in the political risk of the recipient country is accompanied by a <lb/>2 per cent rise in the volume of bilateral bank lending. The results are quite impressive because <lb/>they show as significant all forms of risk identified in previous studies, namely economic, <lb/>financial and political risk (Erb, Harvey and Viskanta, 1996). The most important of the three in <lb/>explaining foreign bank capital movements is political risk, which confirms the findings of <lb/>previous researchers (Gelos and Wei, 2002). Other key results showed that well functioning <lb/></body>

			<body>institutions are key drivers of international bank flows. Banks tend to invest more in countries <lb/>with non-corrupt bureaucracies, high-quality legal systems and non-government controlled <lb/>banking systems. Corporate governance practices and political reforms such as privatisation can <lb/>significantly increase the liquidity of domestic financial intermediaries and thus foster local <lb/>investment. <lb/>Other studies have emphasised that legal systems can explain the specific formats of <lb/>international bank contracts. Government ownership of banks around the world is associated <lb/>with weak growth rates, weak protection of property rights, lower productivity, weak bank <lb/>performance and low levels of financial development (Barth et al., 2001; La Porta et al., 2002). <lb/>State-controlled financial systems tend to promote political rather than profit-maximising <lb/>objectives. The Papaionannou (2004) estimates suggest that an increase of 1 per cent in a <lb/>government&apos;s holdings in the banking system decreases the level of cross-border bank lending <lb/>by 1.6 per cent. As suggested by García-Herrero and Martínez-Peria (2004), the claims of US, <lb/>Spanish and Italian banks in 90 countries tend to be sensitive to transaction costs (informational <lb/>costs) but also to government intervention in the financial sector as well as country risk, which <lb/>includes not only economic and financial variables but also political factors. These results fall in <lb/>line with other studies that have emphasised economic and political determinants of foreign <lb/>banking activity (Martínez Peria et al., 2005). <lb/>These studies highlight that foreign banks seem particularly concerned with political risk <lb/>when considering investing and lending abroad. They tend to invest in countries with high-<lb/>quality institutions and to allocate credit to countries not characterised by corruption and with <lb/>efficient legal systems. The results imply that improving the efficiency of bureaucracies in <lb/>recipient countries, tackling the issues of corruption and enhancing legal systems, particularly <lb/>financial ones, are crucial in attracting foreign banks. The question of political regime preference <lb/>remains untouched by most of these studies, however. Do international private banks have a <lb/>democratic preference when considering their activity in emerging markets? More specifically do <lb/>they increase or decrease their bank lending after democratic transitions? And why? <lb/>Banks are not homogenous and their activities worldwide are quite diverse 12 . This study <lb/>considers only private banks, not multilateral development banks. The BIS international banking <lb/>database tracks only private bank lending. Analyses of multilateral bank lending as well as <lb/>Official Development Assistance merit specific studies, although international development <lb/>finance has already caught the attention of many scholars. There is a particular abundance of <lb/>literature on the politics of development lending and of international debt (for an extensive <lb/>review see, for example, Carlos Santiso, 2004). An interesting historical study could compare <lb/>bank lending behaviour before and after the debt crisis of the 1980s 13 , checking in particular <lb/>12. The study leaves aside the political role of international bankers themselves, as individuals. Narratives <lb/>of their political involvements in both developed and developing countries are part of a very large <lb/>literature ranging from historical biographies and sagas on international bankers like the Warburg, <lb/>Rothschild and JP Morgan founders and dynasties to broader academic studies. See, for example, the <lb/>great Morgan biography of Strouse (1999), Carosso (1987), Ferguson (1998) and Sampson (1982). <lb/>13.

			<body>behaviour during the 1970s when democratic breakdowns multiplied. Due to the lack of BIS data <lb/>for the period this is not feasible. <lb/>The study also focuses on a specific banking activity — lending flows — for which there <lb/>is a large and complete dataset available from the BIS. Banks are in fact very large entities and <lb/>their activities range from bank lending to portfolio investments, through their fund-<lb/>management subsidiaries, for example. Some are also involved in remittance business or <lb/>insurance activities. For these other types of bank activities, in particular portfolio and FDI flows, <lb/>other databases are used and other specific studies carried out (Nieto and Santiso, 2007; Neut <lb/>and Santiso, 2006) as parts of the larger project of which this study is an element. For some <lb/>banking activities abroad a lack of disaggregate data prevents the kind of analysis presented <lb/>here. For example, there are hardly any data disaggregated by country (including emerging <lb/>economies) on international derivative contracts comparable to the BIS data on bank lending and <lb/>borrowing. <lb/>The BIS data include banking claims and liabilities, i.e. information on lenders and <lb/>borrowers. The focus here lies on lending rather than borrowing (liabilities being the counterpart <lb/>of claims and reflecting in the end the same kind of information). One question is set aside <lb/>because of a lack of data. The BIS data set does not include disaggregate data on borrowers. <lb/>Further research using other data sets (probably country case studies) could examine whether <lb/>bankers in non-democracies tend to differentiate between borrowers. Do they discriminate <lb/>between sovereign, authoritarian governments (and sub-national authorities), and private <lb/>borrowers? This would test whether banks differentiate between undemocratic governments and <lb/>their suffering subjects when making credit decisions. <lb/>The BIS monitors the foreign claims held by mostly OECD-country banks on the rest of <lb/>the world. It provides the most comprehensive data on international banking activity. It defines <lb/>the claims as those extended by international banks to residents outside the countries in which <lb/>the banks are headquartered. Foreign claims may cover financial assets such as loans, debt <lb/>securities and equities, including equity participation in subsidiaries. The BIS data allow study of <lb/>stocks or flows of claims or liabilities, and they differentiate them by countries but not by public <lb/>and private borrowers in specific countries. The analysis here centres on flows, i.e. new claims, <lb/>rather than stocks in order to test whether international private banks react positively or <lb/>negatively to democratic transitions, and whether they increase or decrease their lending with <lb/>the later consolidation of democracy. This enables evaluation of the political development <lb/>contribution of banks. They are known to be key actors in economic development in emerging <lb/>countries (as well as developed countries) but do they also contribute to their political <lb/>development? Between 1980 and 2005, more than 80 countries took significant steps towards <lb/>democracy, particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe. For that reason, Latin American <lb/>and Eastern European countries receive special attention. <lb/>developing-country borrowers was driven by large international OECD-based commercial banks&apos; well-<lb/>founded belief that their own home-country governments were unlikely to allow the &quot;sovereign&quot; <lb/>borrowing-country governments to default on payment. <lb/></body>

			<body>III. BANKS&apos; PREFERENCE FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACIES: <lb/>HYPOTHESIS AND ARGUMENTS <lb/>Why would banks prefer emerging democracies? Why would emerging democracies be <lb/>good business for them? In making decisions, bankers analyse key policies, especially fiscal, <lb/>monetary and trade policies. More generally, other variables such as privatisation and growth <lb/>have been identified as basic drivers of banking activity and entry into countries. In considering <lb/>all the variables, this paper centres attention on young democracies. <lb/>Look first at the key policies. Empirical research shows a complex relationship between <lb/>democracy and fiscal policy. Democratically elected politicians are supposed to be prone to seek <lb/>to minimise taxation and maximise spending, leading to an increase in budget deficits. Some <lb/>studies find no significant relationship between countries&apos; level of democracy and their average <lb/>spending on social security and education (Mulligan et al., 2004). Many other, more recent ones <lb/>(Tavares and Wacziarg, 2001; Block, 2002; Block et al., 2003; Keefer, 2005) indicate, as suggested <lb/>by Converse and Kaptsein (2006) that young democracies tend to exhibit initial increases in <lb/>public spending, with current expenditure picking up in election years and followed later by a <lb/>long-term decline. Brender and Drazen (2004) find also that political budget cycles are strongly <lb/>present only in newly democratised countries. In a sample of 68 democracies from 1960 to 2001, <lb/>the traces of political budget cycles appear in the first four elections following democratisation. <lb/>Thus emerging democracies&apos; financial needs tend to increase in the very first years of their <lb/>existence, leading them to boost their borrowing activity and to become potentially good clients <lb/>of international banks. <lb/>Given monetary policy&apos;s importance to the economic well-being of banks, one must also <lb/>question how young democracies perform in this regard. Several studies reveal that democratic <lb/>institutions enhance the quality of monetary policy making. As Converse and Kapstein (2006) <lb/>underline, young democracies perform quite impressively on inflation; from an average of 125 <lb/>per cent the year of the democratic transition, consumer price inflation drops to around 50 per <lb/>cent on average in four years. This pattern is not uniform among regions, however. In Latin <lb/>America, where hyperinflation has been very damaging, levels of inflation, while reduced, have <lb/>remained very high four years after democratic transition; on average they reach 390 per cent in <lb/>the year of transition and 123 per cent four years later, still high and damaging for banks. Yet the <lb/>more general trend characterises the major recipients of bank lending, also the major countries of <lb/>the region. In countries like Mexico, Brazil or Argentina, inflation has slowed dramatically in the <lb/>years following democratic transitions and above all after democratic consolidations. <lb/>Good trade policy also leads to more banking activity, particularly increased lending <lb/>through trade finance and export credits. Several studies corroborate that democracy increases <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>trade openness. Milner and Kubota (2005) show, for example, that higher levels of democracy are <lb/>associated with more liberal trade regimes, particularly in newer developing-world democracies. <lb/>These findings are consistent with other studies showing greater degrees of democracy <lb/>significantly associated with higher trade-to-GDP ratios. Converse and Kaptsein (2006) found in <lb/>their 114 cases of democratisation between 1960 and 2003 that such trade ratios increased by <lb/>nearly 10 percentage points in the three years following democratic transitions, jumping from an <lb/>average of 59 per cent of GDP in the year of transition to 69 per cent of GDP three years later <lb/>14 . <lb/>Privatisation in young democracies also tends to favour more banking activity. <lb/>Privatisation operations are highly attractive for banks, implying high fees for those involved as <lb/>advisers and lucrative lending operations to finance takeovers by private operators. Several <lb/>empirical studies document that democracy is substantially and significantly associated with the <lb/>extent of privatisation (for a review and analysis see Biglaiser and Danis, 2002). Democracies <lb/>privatise more than non-democracies and young democracies especially use heavy privatisation <lb/>programmes in order to finance increasing social demands. Privatisation has been particularly <lb/>intensive in Latin American and Eastern European emerging democracies. Latin America <lb/>accounted for 55 per cent of total privatisation revenues in the developing world in the 1990s, the <lb/>proceeds reaching nearly $180 billion (Chong and López de Silanes, 2004). <lb/>All the key policies, but mainly fiscal and trade policies, tend to support greater bank <lb/>lending to emerging democracies. The results are more mixed for monetary policies. <lb/>Privatisation booms, particularly intense in emerging democracies, also provide good reasons for <lb/>banks to support increasing lending activity. Young democracies also grow faster in the first <lb/>years following transition, as Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005) show. They found in an extensive <lb/>sample of 154 countries that the first five years following democratic transition saw significantly <lb/>higher economic growth and lower variance in growth rates. <lb/>These conclusions on growth might not be as clear as at first sight, however. The link <lb/>between democracy and economic performance remains tenuous. Both the theoretical and the <lb/>empirical literature are split over the effects of democracy on growth. Some scholars have <lb/>questioned &quot; development &quot; theories, arguing that democracy has a questionable and statistically <lb/>insignificant effect on economic growth (Przeworski et al., 2000) 15 . On the effects of democratic <lb/>transition on economic development, some argue that the causality runs from economic <lb/>development to a higher probability of transition to democracy (Boix and Stokes, 2003; Boix, <lb/>2003). Others conclude that transitions to democracy do not necessarily become more likely <lb/>when a country is more developed as measured by per capita income (Przeworski, 2004c). Feng <lb/>14 . Other studies by López-Córdoba and Meissner find a positive relation between trade openness and <lb/>democracy from 1895 onwards. The impact of openness by region shows some variation, and the <lb/>authors note that commodity and petroleum exporters do not seem to become more democratic by <lb/>exporting more commodities and oil (López-Córdoda and Meissner, 2005). While the impact of <lb/>democracy on trade openness seems strong, there is much more discussion on the impact of trade on <lb/>democracy: Rigobón and Rodrik (2004) find results totally different from those of López-Córdoba and <lb/>Meissner, while Papaioannou and Siourounis (2005), find a much weaker impact of trade openness on <lb/>democracy. <lb/>15. For a critical analysis of the new institutionalism literature, see Przeworski, (2004a). <lb/></body>

			<body>(2003) reaches the same conclusion, using large samples of countries over long periods to show <lb/>that the effect of democracy on growth is statistically insignificant. He also finds, however, that <lb/>political democracy has a significant impact on private investment. Reductions in political <lb/>instability and policy uncertainty have a positive impact on the economy. <lb/>Still others have established strong links between democracy and growth and between <lb/>the quality of institutions and long-term growth (Acemoglu et al., 2004; Persson and <lb/>Tabellini, 2003; Persson, 2004), or found positive effects of democracy and the rule of law on <lb/>economic performance, with the latter having a much stronger impact (Rigobón and Rodrik, <lb/>2004). The relation between democracy and the rule of law is not systematic, however, as <lb/>highlighted by examples in Latin America where transitions to democracy have proceeded <lb/>without consolidation of the rule of law. In the absence of meaningful judicial systems, <lb/>democratisation often has not culminated in the consolidation of the rule of law (Malone, 2003), a <lb/>key driver of private capital flows to emerging markets. <lb/>Growth performance improves after the transition to democracy. Moreover, growth <lb/>under democracy appears more stable than under authoritarian regimes. Based on a sample of <lb/>40 countries and comparing their economic performances before and after they became <lb/>democratic over the past 40 years, Jian-Guang Shen (2002) shows that the ten-year average <lb/>growth rate is a half percentage point higher after transition to democracy. The five-year average <lb/>growth rate after the adoption of democracy is even higher; a full percentage point. More than <lb/>60 per cent of the sample countries experienced growth acceleration after democratic transition. <lb/>Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005) also reveal that major democratic transitions had positive effects on <lb/>economic growth in the short run and tended to associate with a decline in growth volatility. <lb/>Their findings are based on a large sample of countries, cover a long period (1950-2000) and <lb/>confirm that particularly low-income countries experienced a short-term boost in growth after <lb/>democratic transition. <lb/>Papaioannou and Siourounis (2004) arrive at a similar conclusion by analysing the <lb/>evolution of GDP growth before and after permanent democratisations in 1960-2000. According <lb/>to their estimates, democratisation leads on average to an approximate increase of 0.7 per cent to <lb/>1.0 per cent in real per capita growth. It is associated not only with higher growth but also less <lb/>volatile growth rates, confirming previous findings (Rodrik, 1997, 1999). Democratisation has the <lb/>strongest impact on growth volatility in highly unstable countries such as those in Latin <lb/>America. <lb/>Persson and Tabellini (2005a) conducted decisive research underlining that <lb/>democratisations induce growth acceleration and therefore are good for banking business. <lb/>Drawing on previous and complementary research (Persson, 2004; Persson and Tabellini, 2004; <lb/>Persson and Tabellin, 2005b) and considering different forms of democracy, they show that <lb/>becoming a democracy accelerates growth by 0.75 percentage points. With an estimated <lb/>convergence rate of 6 per cent per year, they also show that the long-run effect on income per <lb/>capita is 12.5 percentage points. The findings are based on a very large sample of about 150 <lb/>countries, include 120 regime changes over 1960-2000 and are consistent with previous studies <lb/>(Papaioannou and Siouroumis, 2004). Another result reveals that new presidential democracies <lb/></body>

			<body>grow on average 1.5 percentage point more than new parliamentary democracies. This is <lb/>particularly interesting for Latin American countries, where presidential regimes dominate. <lb/>Other factors, more related to institutional quality and public goods outputs, may also <lb/>have relevance for explaining increased bank lending in newly democratised countries. <lb/>Democracies have more incentives to provide benefits for the public than do autocracies. They <lb/>tend to be much more transparent than non-democracies, releasing more information on tax <lb/>revenue collection (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). Based on a large empirical study tracking the <lb/>missing data in the World Bank&apos;s World Development Indicators, Rosendorff and Vreeland <lb/>(2004) found that the missing data are in fact correlated with regime type, thus showing that <lb/>democracies are much more transparent than non-democracies. This is key; the institutions that <lb/>matter for economic development are in the end those that induce governments to limit taxes on <lb/>income, make rulers accountable and provide information on government policies, thereby <lb/>allowing informed citizens to sanction misbehaviour (Przeworski, 2004b; Benhabib and <lb/>Przeworski, 2004). Not surprisingly, foreign direct investors (international banks included) tend <lb/>to prefer more transparent countries (Mody et al., 2003), where transaction costs related to <lb/>corruption are lower, for example. <lb/>Strong economic arguments, already tested empirically, thus help to explain a potential <lb/>political preference for emerging democracies by banks. The empirical test of this preference <lb/>remains an open question, however. <lb/></body>

			<body>IV. BANK FLOWS TO EMERGING MARKETS: STYLISED FACTS <lb/>Before testing the hypothesis that bankers prefer emerging democracies, the importance <lb/>of private bank flows needs emphasis. Private foreign lending can constitute a substantial <lb/>fraction of claims in recipient countries. Over the past decade, foreign bank claims took off with <lb/>greater financial integration and the opening of emerging countries to private capital flows. In <lb/>consequence, private international loans equalled 48.3 per cent of global GDP in 2005 16 , more <lb/>than the total of international trade flows combined with all foreign direct investment and global <lb/>tourist receipts (Figure 1). <lb/>Figure 1. Global Foreign Claims <lb/>World Foreign Claims (% of World GDP) <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>1999 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>% <lb/>Source: based on BIS and IMF <lb/>The test of the hypothesis depends for data on the BIS &quot;Consolidated Foreign Claims of <lb/>Reporting Banks on Individual Countries&quot; statistical series from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the <lb/>first quarter of 2006 17 . Because this study tries to show the relationships between private banking <lb/>flows and levels of democratisation as well as between bank flows and changes in these levels, <lb/>the focus lies on countries that have gone farther down the road towards democracy, i.e. mainly <lb/>emerging countries. Private bank flows towards emerging countries are very low in nominal <lb/>16. The BIS defines the foreign claims held by banks mostly from OECD countries vis-à-vis the rest of the <lb/>world as those authorised by international banks on residents outside the country in which they are <lb/>headquartered. Foreign claims may range from assets such as loans and debt securities to equities, <lb/>including equity stakes in local subsidiaries. <lb/>17. For more information, see www.bis.org <lb/>Banking on Democracy: The Political Economy of International Private Bank Lending in Emerging Markets <lb/>DEV/DOC(2007)2 <lb/>22 <lb/>© OECD 2007 <lb/>terms compared with those to developed countries, which receive more than 90 per cent of the <lb/>total. Yet they have great importance for developing economies in that they are equivalent to a <lb/>relatively high percentage of their GDP. <lb/>By region, Latin America and the Caribbean were the main recipients of bank flows in the <lb/>mid-1980s, although they subsequently eased off (Figures 2 and 3). At the end of 1984, this region <lb/>received 47 per cent of the flows to emerging countries, whereas Africa received about 21 per <lb/>cent, Asia 20 per cent and Europe 12 per cent (See also Table 1 of Appendix 1). Latin America <lb/>remained the biggest recipient until the fourth quarter of 2003. Since the beginning of 2004, Asia <lb/>has received the largest share (31.4 per cent of the total in Q1 2006). In 2006, Emerging Europe <lb/>became the second biggest destination with 31.1 per cent of the total, followed by Latin America <lb/>with 24.5 per cent; Africa brought up the rear with only 13 per cent. <lb/>Figure 2.

In fact, these two countries received the largest country shares of total loans to <lb/>emerging markets over the past two decades, with flows exceeding those directed at Asian <lb/>emerging economies, although Asia and Emerging Europe obtained more financing than Latin <lb/>America as a whole. This arises from the greater concentration of banking flows to Latin America <lb/>in a few countries, compared with the wider distribution among countries in Asia. Mexico and <lb/>Brazil received similar amounts of financing until the second half of the 1990s, when Brazil grew <lb/>in importance as Mexico decreased. From 2000 onwards, however, Mexico regained the top spot, <lb/>reaching 10.5 per cent of the total in 2005 (similar to the shares of Africa and the Middle East in <lb/>the same year). Brazil&apos;s importance as a fiscal paradise for banking investment fell considerably <lb/>from the beginning of 2002, with its share of total emerging-country bank flows falling from 10.5 <lb/>per cent at the end of 2001 to a mere 6.9 per cent in 2006. Other Latin American countries such as <lb/>Argentina and Venezuela have experienced a considerable drop in foreign bank financing. The <lb/>main winners from Latin America&apos;s loss of share since 2001 (including Mexico) have been <lb/>emerging Asian economies and the Eastern European countries. Over the past three years they <lb/>have included Taiwan, China, South Korea, India, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (See <lb/>Table 1 and Graphs 1 and 2 of Appendix 1). <lb/></body>

			<body>V. BANKS AND EMERGING DEMOCRACIES <lb/>Proximity and cultural factors seem to be variables behind these trends in bank flows. <lb/>GDP, population, surface area in square kilometres, interest rates and even levels of corruption <lb/>represent other key drivers of such flows (Papaioannou, 2004). This paper focuses not on these <lb/>variables but on determining if political factors make some difference in the granting of <lb/>international bank financing. To do so it uses variables such as the democratic transition year, the <lb/>level of democratisation, the stability of economic policy, the political stability of ministries and <lb/>the differences between presidencies in different emerging countries. <lb/>As many researchers highlight, the analysis of democratisation and private bank flows <lb/>raises a number of methodological issues. Data availability is one, along with the measures used <lb/>to gather the data. Most of the datasets present availability weaknesses, but more importantly the <lb/>hypotheses, concepts and definitions behind them are open to question. One important issue <lb/>regards causality. Private bank money may flow towards emerging democracies just because <lb/>windows of opportunity like privatisations have suddenly opened. Banks may rush towards <lb/>emerging democracies not because they are democracies but because they privatise their banks. <lb/>Democracies — at least in Latin America — had a strong propensity to privatise during <lb/>the last decades of the 20th century. They tended to prefer fully to privatise assets while <lb/>autocracies tried to maintain control over their economies. In the end, as highlighted by Giavazzi <lb/>and Tabellini (2004), political and economic liberalisation have been closely connected. They feed <lb/>on each other, so that it is difficult to discren the direction of causality. Analysis of the timing of <lb/>different events does indicate, however, that the causality is more likely to run from political to <lb/>economic reforms. Democratisation appears to lead to economic liberalisation, with the extent of <lb/>liberalisation gradually increasing in the years following the transition to democracy. This would <lb/>suggest that the political shifts induce economic liberalisation to a far greater extent than the <lb/>other way around, particularly in Latin America, where in most cases political liberalisation took <lb/>place before bank privatisation 18 . <lb/>18. In the classification of Giavazzi and Tabellini, all Latin American countries except Chile, Mexico and <lb/>Peru liberalised their economies first and afterwards experienced political liberalisation. One can <lb/>nevertheless discuss the assigned timing of both political and economic liberalisation. In Mexico, for <lb/>example, permanent democratisation dated from 1994, whereas many scholars considered that 1988 or <lb/>2000 were the years when full democratisation took place. <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>The first approach to the question &quot; Do bankers prefer democracy in emerging markets? &quot; , <lb/>analyses the correlation between the BIS data series and political databases, using the standard <lb/>classification of democracy of Przeworski et al. (2000) 19 . Two series indicate the level of <lb/>democratisation. The first, called &quot; Consolidation of Democracy &quot; , was formulated by Schmitter <lb/>and Schneider (2004). It measures the extent to which democracy consolidates itself. It provides <lb/>yearly figures for a series of countries. The greater the value, the stronger democracy is rooted. <lb/>The second indicator, more commonly used in economic literature, is the &quot;Democracy Score&quot; <lb/>formulated by &quot;Polity IV&quot;. It measures countries&apos; existing levels of democracy. It also has an <lb/>annual series. Its value ranges from zero to ten, where proximity to ten means a higher level of <lb/>democratisation and vice versa. <lb/>The years in which democratic transition took place in different countries also are useful <lb/>to gauge whether banking flows increased after transition. These figures come from research <lb/>developed by Giavazzi and Tabellini (2004), Carrillo et al., (2004) and Przeworski et al. (2000). In <lb/>line with Persson and Tabellini (2003), Persson (2004) and a large body of literature on the topic, <lb/>a country is defined as a democracy if it has strictly positive values for the indicator POLITY2 in <lb/>the POLITY IV database. In line with Giavazzi and Tabellini (2004), democratisation is an event <lb/>in which a country becomes a democracy when this was not the case the previous year. The <lb/>Giavazzi and Tabellini timing is verified and cross-checked with Carillo et al. (2004) for Latin <lb/>America and with Przeworski et al. (2000). <lb/>A graphical analysis of foreign claims by country in combination with the democracy <lb/>indicators, shows a common pattern for countries and indicators (Figure 5 and Appendix 2). An <lb/>increase in the democracy indicators has a positive impact on the entry of private foreign claims, <lb/>although in some countries there is a lag of two or three years. This pattern is particularly <lb/>important in Latin America, a region that experienced the most impressive democratic <lb/>transitions over the past decade along with Eastern Europe (where the relation also looks strong <lb/>as shown in the country cases in Appendix 2). In some of the graphs a vertical line shows the <lb/>year in which transition took place. <lb/>19. Regimes are classified as democracies if in a given year they satisfy simultaneously four criteria: i) the <lb/>chief executive is elected; ii) the legislature is elected; iii) more than one party competes in the elections; <lb/>iv) incumbent parties have in the past lost an election and yielded office or will do so in the future. All <lb/>regimes that fail to satisfy at least one of these criteria are classified as non-democratic (Przeworski et <lb/>al., 2000, pp. 18-29). Hence the political regime classification is simplified and becomes a dichotomous <lb/>variable that takes a value of O if a country is a democracy and 1 if it is not according to the four <lb/>cumulative criteria. <lb/></body>

			<body>Next, consider countries for which data are available and which have undergone <lb/>democratic transition (mostly in Latin America and Eastern Europe). How did democratic <lb/>transition affect private bank inflows? Taking the year of transition as t=0 for all countries, one <lb/>can observe the growth rates of banking flows before and after transition. The results are <lb/>striking. Before democratic transition, the annual growth of flows in the three previous years has <lb/>a mean equal to 1.04 per cent. After transition, banking flows in the following three years <lb/>accelerate, growing at an average of 4.37 per cent. For Latin American countries alone in the <lb/>three years prior to transition, annual average growth was negative at -1.53 per cent, then <lb/>jumped to 4.28 per cent for the three years after transition. Clearly, at least in Latin America, <lb/>bankers tend to love new emerging democracies and increase their lending to them. A transition <lb/>towards democracy tends to favour foreign bank inflows. The other side of this coin is that <lb/>emerging borrowers have had easier access to foreign private bank lending, once they became <lb/>democracies. <lb/>Another way to look at the democratic preferences of bankers is to consider the quality of <lb/>the political regimes that emerged from democratic transition. Once democracy is in place, do <lb/>foreign bankers take quality into account, i.e. do they react to democratic breakdowns at the <lb/>micro level? Democratic breakdown is usually associated with the collapse of democracy (Linz, <lb/>1978). Since the 1980s, in fact, no Latin American country has experienced such a collapse, but <lb/>there has been abundant discussion regarding the quality of these democracies. &quot; Delegative <lb/>democracies &quot; have been criticised, for example, for being inadequately constrained by a weak <lb/>network of state institutions whose role is to check executive abuses of power. In line with <lb/>Barndt (2003), however, one can argue that democratic breakdowns can occur not only at the <lb/>macro level but also at the micro level. Across the continent, &quot; executive assaults &quot; abound. These <lb/>are events in which an elected president tries to restrict the access of certain individuals to state <lb/>power by temporarily suspending their ability to avail themselves of the constitutive attributes of <lb/>democracy meant to be enshrined in the regime. Executive assaults are in the end attempts by <lb/>presidents to dismantle democracy at the micro-level, such as the attempt (an example from <lb/>Barndt) by Banzer in Bolivia in 1999 to quash peasant protests by detaining the leaders and <lb/>restricting the right to gather in public. <lb/></body>

			<body>Based on a collection of executive-assault data since the onset of the third wave of <lb/>democratisation in the region from the beginning of the 1980s for ten country-periods, Barndt <lb/>reported 204 observations and more than 120 cases of assault. All countries except Chile <lb/>experienced at least one case of assault and several experienced more than ten. Table 1 quickly <lb/>confirms that foreign banks seem indifferent to the proliferation of executive assaults: they tend <lb/>to increase their lending presence regardless of increases in micro-democratic breakdowns. <lb/>Table 1.

BANKS AND POLICY INSTABILITY IN EMERGING DEMOCRACIES <lb/>Given that bankers prefer emerging democracies, this section shifts the focus away from <lb/>political regimes to policy stability in order to gauge whether bankers prefer it too. The common <lb/>and generalised perception is that they tend to be risk-averse and avoid politically unstable <lb/>countries for generally good reasons, because instability has a negative economic impact, <lb/>particularly on growth, debt levels, fiscal deficits and inflation rates. In their core decision <lb/>making on political risk, banks are put off by political instability in general because it increases <lb/>policy instability, which in turn impacts negatively on growth and discourages private <lb/>investment. Yet they do not seem sensitive to all kinds of instability. They show some neutrality <lb/>toward democratic political instability, in spite of which they have continued to invest in Latin <lb/>American emerging democracies in recent decades. <lb/>Latin America is known as one of the world&apos;s most politically unstable areas. Between <lb/>1945 and 2000, it saw around 160 occurrences of regime transition — shifts from non-<lb/>democracies towards democracies and vice-versa 20 . The region contains fewer than 10 per cent of <lb/>the countries in the world, but it had more than 35 per cent of the regime transitions in the <lb/>period. It averaged three regime transitions per country. South Asian countries in comparison <lb/>had 1.4 transitions per country during the same years (Cheibub, 2003). Peru, for example (not the <lb/>most unstable in the region by any means) had frequent political changes not only among the <lb/>players in the game, but also in the playing field and the game itself. Since its independence in <lb/>1821, the country has had 13 constitutions and 108 governments, only 19 of which were elected <lb/>and only nine of which completed their terms. Over the past two decades, democracy <lb/>reappeared with three constitutional presidents installed between 1980 and 1992; a regime <lb/>classified as semi-authoritarian between 1992 and 2001; and a fully democratic regime with two <lb/>constitutional presidents since 2001 (Moron and Sanborn, 2006). <lb/>20. As highlighted by Epstein et al. (2005), the classification of political regimes is one of the most hotly <lb/>debated issues in the study of democratisation. The problem arises because the predominant situation <lb/>over the past few decades has in fact involved movements into and out of an intermediate category that <lb/>clearly dominates the dynamics of regime transition. In their data covering all countries from 1955 to <lb/>2000, only 16 transitions from full democracy to autocracy and 22 reverse transitions from autocracy to <lb/>full democracy occurred, while 149 transitions into or out of partial democracy took place. From 1955 to <lb/>2005, partial democracy always represented less than 30 per cent of all regimes. Neither are <lb/>dictatorships all the same, and many, as Przeworski et al. (2000) argue, exhibit the full gamut of <lb/>seemingly democratic institutions (Przeworski and Gandhi, 2004). For conceptual discussions regarding <lb/>the problems of defining and measuring democracy, see also Cheibub and Gandhi (2004) and Bollen <lb/>and Paxton (1998; 2000). <lb/></body>

			<body>Latin American democracies have tended to stabilise over the decades, as Figure 6 shows. <lb/>Policy instability is captured by an Economic Policy Stability Index. The index draws on the <lb/>Fraser Institute&apos;s Economic Freedom of the World Index (EFW Index, Source: Freedom House Index), <lb/>used among others by Mariano Tommasi (2005) (see also Tommasi and Spiller, 2007; Tommasi <lb/>and Stein, forthcoming).

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>VII. BANK FLOWS AND POLITICAL STABILITY <lb/>IN EMERGING DEMOCRACIES <lb/>This section analyses the entry of banking flows into Latin American countries and their <lb/>possible relationship with the stability of ministerial and gubernatorial offices. As already <lb/>demonstrated, banks have tended to boost their activity in the region, increasing their lending <lb/>after the return of democracy despite the long track record of political instability in Latin <lb/>America. Political regime instability has almost disappeared since the third wave of <lb/>democratisation in the sense of no major democratic breakdowns in the region. This contrasts <lb/>with the previously large number of coups d&apos;état and other successful efforts to remove sitting <lb/>governments through illegal and sometimes violent action — more than 70 in Latin America over <lb/>the last half century alone and nearly one per year from the 1800s to the 1970s. Yet this does not <lb/>mean that political instability has disappeared. Regular events such as elections, cabinet <lb/>reshuffles or political crises still remain. What impact does such democratic instability, political <lb/>change within a democratic regime, have on bank flows? <lb/>Democratic political instability can be measured in terms of cabinet turnover; i.e. changes <lb/>in the composition of a cabinet within a government&apos;s lifetime (Huber and Martínez-Gallardo, <lb/>2003). A dataset developed by Martínez-Gallardo (2004) records within the limits of source <lb/>availability all the changes in the composition of cabinets in seven Latin American countries <lb/>between 1988 and 2000. Cabinet changes include both terminations (ministers who resign from <lb/>their posts and take up work elsewhere) and reshuffles, where ministers move from one portfolio <lb/>to another. All such changes take place, therefore, within the rules of the democratic game. <lb/>Democratic instability thus defined has been quite intensive in Latin America with <lb/>notable differences between countries and presidential mandates within them. By the end of <lb/>President Figueres&apos; four-year mandate (1994-1998) in Costa Rica, 15 of his 25 original ministers <lb/>still held the same positions, while just two of the ministers originally appointed by Colombian <lb/>President Ernesto Samper remained in the government (and both moved to different portfolios). <lb/>The average time spent in office by ministers in Figueres&apos; cabinet was 35 months; the average for <lb/>their Colombian counterparts over the same period was less than half that (15 months). <lb/>Cabinet stability for the countries included in the dataset (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, <lb/>Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay) also <lb/>varies with respect to reshuffles and terminations. Reshuffles have been substantially less <lb/>common than terminations, less than 10 per cent of all the movements recorded. Abrupt changes <lb/>(terminations) have been more common. The relative frequency of reshuffles also varies across <lb/>countries, ranging from only 4 per cent of movements in Colombia and Ecuador to 8-11 per cent <lb/></body>

			<body>in most countries (Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Paraguay and Costa Rica), 12 per cent <lb/>in Mexico, 14 per cent in Uruguay and even 21 per cent in Argentina <lb/>21 . <lb/>Changes in ministerial tenures should have some impact on bank flows to the extent that <lb/>they could affect the quality of democratic policy making and the performance of governments. <lb/>Ministerial cabinets are consistently more stable under situations of higher growth rates and in <lb/>more constant environments for law and order. Cabinet changes are, in one way or another, <lb/>political responses to shocks. Ministers may be changed due to shifts in presidential strategy, <lb/>opposition pressure, or exogenous shocks like financial crises. Obvious examples are the <lb/>departure of finance ministers in the wake of financial disruption or economic crisis. A political <lb/>shock might cause a party to pull out of a ruling coalition, forcing ministers who are members of <lb/>that party to abandon the executive. Vacancies produced by such events can be filled with <lb/>politicians or technocrats from within the cabinet in order to smooth the change. After the 1994 <lb/>devaluation in Mexico, for example, President Zedillo replaced his minister of finance with <lb/>another cabinet member in an effort (unsuccessful) to overcome the crisis (Santiso, 1999). <lb/>Bankers seem indifferent as to whether centre, left or right-wing governments are in <lb/>power and whether they have an absolute majority or operate in coalition with other parties. <lb/>They show the same indifference to political instability as measured by cabinet turnover <lb/>(Table 3). The correlations of foreign claims with ministerial stability and the average duration of <lb/>ministers in office are insignificant at 0.10 and 0.06 respectively. Bank flows just do not appear as <lb/>sensitive to ministerial turnover measured by time in office. <lb/>An econometric exercise checks and confirms the results (Table 4). Several empirical <lb/>studies analyse the determinants of bank flows (Papaioannou, 2004). The purpose here is <lb/>simpler: to verify the previous findings for political variables using another tool. The analysis <lb/>uses panel data on 29 countries for 1984-2004 (annual frequency). The explanatory variables for <lb/>bank flows are economic (GDP, population, human capital proxies and interest rates) and <lb/>political (the &quot; consolidation of democracy &quot; , &quot; democracy score &quot; and &quot; economic policy stability &quot; <lb/>indicators, plus ministerial stability and the composition of governments). <lb/>Foreign claims, apart from depending on GDP and population, also correlate positively <lb/>with levels of democratisation in recipient countries. The results are confirmed with both the <lb/> &quot; consolidation of democracy &quot; indicator (CoD in Table 4) and the &quot; democracy score &quot; indicator <lb/>(DS). The economic policy stability indicator (EFW) also influences financial inflows, but the <lb/>results are less trustworthy because the EFW data are available only every five years for 1985-<lb/>2000, which means a smaller pool of information. A country receives more financing when its <lb/>gross domestic product increases, its population is higher, more financing came the previous <lb/>year and the country enjoys both greater democratisation and more economic policy stability. <lb/>Ministerial stability and the composition of governments or banks do not appear as determinant <lb/>factors, nor do interest rates or human capital. <lb/>21. The number of reshuffles vs. terminations also varies across portfolios. Finance, for example, accounts <lb/>for only 4 per cent of reshuffles (i.e. 96 per cent terminations) while Interior has 14 per cent (86 per cent <lb/>terminations). One might expect that a large number of Finance terminations would have a bigger <lb/>impact on the banking sector. <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>VIII. CONCLUSIONS: <lb/>Banks are willing to increase their lending to newly emerging democracies. They also <lb/>prefer emerging democracies where policies are stable, but they seem indifferent to democratic <lb/>political instability. The preference for emerging democracies is particularly striking in regions <lb/>like Latin America and Eastern Europe, where democratic transitions multiplied in the past two <lb/>decades; cross-border bank lending tends to rise in the years following authoritarian <lb/>breakdowns. <lb/>Solid economic reasons explain why international banks prefer emerging democracies. <lb/>Good fiscal and monetary policies and institutional quality in emerging democracies favour <lb/>banking business. This preference needs testing for other flows such as FDI, portfolio investment <lb/>and the lending behaviour of public institutions like the multilateral development banks. <lb/>According to some studies, financial markets do not particularly reward democracies, with no <lb/>apparent, significant difference in the interest rates paid by democracies and non-democracies in <lb/>emerging markets 22 . <lb/>Bankers&apos; preferences may lie in ethical as well as economic considerations, as the <lb/>introduction to this paper suggests. Banks might prefer lending to emerging democracies not <lb/>only because it is good business in economic terms, but also because it is good business ethically, <lb/>a pledge of support for democracy, freedom and responsible public order, &quot; all things living &quot; <lb/>along their journey In Search of a Better World as envisaged by the Anglo-Austrian philosopher <lb/>Karl Popper in his collection of essays and lectures on the need for a new professional ethic. <lb/>22. Sebastian Saiegh (2004a,b) provides very stimulating research on this issue, examining the effect of <lb/>political institutions on country risk and interest rates. He shows that emerging democracies are more <lb/>likely to reschedule their debts than are authoritarian regimes and appear to pay higher interest rates. <lb/>These findings are based on data for developing countries covering 1971-1998. <lb/></body>
