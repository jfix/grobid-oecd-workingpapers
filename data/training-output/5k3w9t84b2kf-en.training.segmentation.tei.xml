			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>Waiting times for elective (non-emergency) treatments are a key health policy concern in several <lb/>OECD countries. This study describes common measures on waiting times across OECD countries from <lb/>administrative data. It focuses on common elective procedures, like hip and knee replacement, and cataract <lb/>surgery, where waiting times are notoriously long. It provides comparative data on waiting times across <lb/>twelve OECD countries and presents trends in waiting times in the last decade. Waiting times appear to be <lb/>low in the Netherlands and Denmark. In the last decade the United Kingdom (in particular England), <lb/>Finland and the Netherlands have witnessed large reductions in waiting times which can be attributed to a <lb/>range of policy initiatives, including higher spending, waiting-times target schemes, and incentive <lb/>mechanisms which reward higher levels of activity. The negative trend in these countries has however <lb/>halted in recent years and in some cases reverted. The analysis also emphasizes systematic differences <lb/>across different waiting-time measures, in particular between the distribution of waiting times of patients <lb/>treated versus the one of patients on the list. For example, the mean waiting time of patients on the list is <lb/>generally higher than the mean waiting time of patients treated though we can find examples of the <lb/>opposite. Mean waiting times are systematically higher than median waiting times and the difference can <lb/>be quantitatively large. <lb/>RESUMÉ <lb/>Les délais d&apos;attente pour les traitements électifs (non urgents) constituent un problème majeur de la <lb/>politique de santé dans plusieurs pays de l&apos;OCDE. Cette étude fondée sur des données administratives <lb/>décrit les mesures courantes pour réduire les temps d&apos;attente dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE. Elle se concentre sur <lb/>les interventions non urgentes pratiquées dans les pays, comme le remplacement de la hanche et du genou <lb/>ainsi que la chirurgie de la cataracte, pour lesquels les délais d&apos;attente sont connus pour être longs. Elle <lb/>fournit des données comparatives sur les délais d&apos;attente dans douze pays de l&apos;OCDE et montre comment <lb/>ils ont évolué ces dix dernières années. Ainsi, ils paraissent être courts aux Pays-Bas et au Danemark. Ces <lb/>dix dernières années, le Royaume-Uni (en particulier l&apos;Angleterre), la Finlande et les Pays-Bas ont vu leurs <lb/>délais d&apos;attente se réduire considérablement, ceci pouvant être attribué à une série d&apos;initiatives stratégiques, <lb/>comme une hausse des dépenses, la mise en place de systèmes d&apos;objectif des délais d&apos;attente et des <lb/>mécanismes d&apos;incitation récompensant des niveaux d&apos;activité plus élevés. La réduction des délais d&apos;attente <lb/>dans ces pays s&apos;est toutefois interrompue depuis quelques années et, dans certains cas, ils sont même <lb/>revenus à la hausse. L&apos;analyse souligne également des différences systématiques entre les différentes <lb/>mesures relatives aux délais d&apos;attente, en particulier entre la répartition des délais d&apos;attente des patients <lb/>traités et celle des personnes inscrites sur des listes d&apos;attente. Par exemple, le délai d&apos;attente moyen des <lb/>patients sur une liste est généralement plus élevé que celui des patients traités, bien qu&apos;il existe des contre-<lb/>exemples. Les délais d&apos;attente moyens sont systématiquement plus élevés que les délais d&apos;attente médians <lb/>et la différence peut être quantitativement importante. <lb/></body>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>Waiting times for elective procedures are a major health policy concern in many OECD <lb/>countries. Policymakers across the world face considerable challenges in reducing waiting times. Policy <lb/>initiatives are regularly introduced to tackle excessive waiting times with varying success (Siciliani, <lb/>Borowitz and Moran, 2013). * <lb/>2. <lb/>This study aims at providing comparative evidence of waiting times across OECD countries and <lb/>explores trends in waiting times in the last decade. OECD countries tend to differ in the way waiting times <lb/>are measured and utilised for benchmarking or regulatory purposes. We identify the most common <lb/>measures and explain how these differ. We then compare waiting times across 12 OECD countries 1 for <lb/>common surgical procedures (such as hip and knee replacement and cataract). We compare mean and <lb/>median waiting times and their distribution. Finally, we illustrate time trends in waiting times and relate <lb/>sharp reductions in waiting times for some countries to specific policy initiatives. Comparative information <lb/>on waiting times can feed into policy discussion and contribute to assessment of the waiting time <lb/>phenomenon in each county. The analysis on time trends can help to identify countries that have been able <lb/>to successfully and significantly reduce waiting times. <lb/>3. <lb/>The analysis is part of the Second OECD Waiting Time Project in 2011-12 whose objectives <lb/>were to compare policies across countries (see Siciliani, Borowitz and Moran, 2013) and collect <lb/>comparative waiting times figures for specific procedures, which is the focus of this study. <lb/>2 The analysis <lb/>relies on measures of waiting times from large administrative datasets for specific surgical procedures. <lb/>4. <lb/>The existing evidence on comparative waiting times is very limited. Siciliani and Hurst (2004) <lb/>provide similar comparative data for the year 2000. These data are now out of date and are limited in that <lb/>they refer to only one of the three measures employed in this study (the inpatient waiting time of patient <lb/>treated) for one point in time. Our study updates such data, employs additional common measures (such as <lb/>the waiting time of patients on the list, and the waiting time from referral to treatment), explores the <lb/>distribution of waiting times and provides time trends covering a 10-year period. There is some limited <lb/>evidence on waiting times from survey data especially from Commonwealth countries (Shoen et al., 2010). <lb/>However, these are aggregated for any elective procedure, are based on small samples and may suffer from <lb/>recall bias. Evidence on waiting times constructed from administrative data is based on large samples (in <lb/>most cases they include the whole population who received a treatment), using objective measures of <lb/>waiting times and suffer less from aggregation bias (since it focuses on specific procedures). Recent work <lb/>by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) (SALAR, 2011, 2013) compares <lb/>Sweden with other countries. This work uses waiting times data sourced from secondary sources (not from <lb/>a direct questionnaire to countries as is the source of the data collection discussed in this paper), covers <lb/>only two procedures and refers to one point in time. <lb/>* <lb/>Luigi Siciliani and Valerie Moran, University of York; Michael Borowitz, Global Fund. <lb/>1 <lb/>Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, <lb/>Sweden and the United Kingdom. <lb/>2 <lb/>A summary of the First OECD Waiting Time Project is contained in Siciliani and Hurst (2004, 2005). <lb/></body>

			<body>2. Data <lb/>Background: Measures of waiting times across OECD countries <lb/>5. <lb/>The measurement of waiting times varies across OECD countries. Common measures from <lb/>administrative datasets are the &quot; inpatient waiting time &quot; (from specialist addition to the list to treatment) <lb/>and the &quot; referral-to-treatment waiting time &quot; (from GP/family doctor referral to treatment). <lb/>6. <lb/>Common reported figures include the mean waiting times, the waiting time at different <lb/>percentiles of the distribution (at the 50 th percentile, i.e. the median, the 80 th or 90 th percentile), and the <lb/>number of patients waiting more than a threshold waiting time, for example three, six or nine months. <lb/>7. <lb/>Waiting times are reported in most countries by procedure (e.g. hip and knee replacement, <lb/>cataract surgery) or by specialty (e.g. ophthalmology, orthopaedics). They refer mainly to two <lb/>distributions: i) the distribution of waiting times of patients treated in a given period (for example a <lb/>financial year); ii) the distribution of waiting times of the patients on the list at a point in time (a census <lb/>date). <lb/>Data collection and waiting time definitions <lb/>8. <lb/>The data were collected as part of the Second OECD Waiting Time Project in 2011-2012. <lb/>Waiting times were collected for the following common elective (non-emergency) surgical procedures: hip <lb/>replacement, knee replacement, cataract surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, prostatectomy, cholecystectomy, <lb/>inguinal and femoral hernia, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary bypass. <lb/>To classify surgical procedures, we used ICD-9-CM codes as a reference (see Appendix). Data were <lb/>collected from 1999 to 2011. For a subset of measures data are available also for 2012. <lb/>3 <lb/>9. <lb/>Our questionnaire asked countries to provide waiting times according to four different <lb/>definitions: <lb/>1. Inpatient waiting times (from specialist addition to the list) of patients treated in a given year <lb/>(publicly funded patients) <lb/>10. <lb/>This definition does not include &apos;the time elapsed from the date of referral of the general <lb/>practitioner to the date of specialist assessment&apos; (in some countries referred to as &apos;outpatient waiting <lb/>time&apos;). Inpatient waiting times were collected for all &apos;publicly-funded patients&apos; that received treatment <lb/>either by publicly or privately (non-profit and for-profit) owned providers. We do not focus on privately-<lb/>funded patients since waiting time data for these patients are generally not collected on a routine basis <lb/>through administrative data. <lb/>2. Referral-to-treatment waiting times (from family doctor referral) of patients treated in a given <lb/>year (publicly funded patients) <lb/>11. <lb/>Referral-to-treatment waiting times refer to &quot; the time elapsed from the family doctor (General <lb/>Practitioner) referral to the date patients added on the non-emergency (elective) surgery waiting list were <lb/>admitted to an inpatient or day-case surgical unit for the procedure &quot; . Therefore, compared to the first <lb/>measure, it includes also the time elapsed from the family doctor (general practitioner) referral to the <lb/>specialist visit. By definition it is longer than the inpatient waiting time. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. Inpatient waiting times (from specialist addition to the list) of patients on the list at a census date <lb/>(publicly funded patients) <lb/>12. <lb/>This measure is analogous to Measure 1 but refers to the patients on the list at a given census date <lb/>(as opposed to the patients treated in a given year). Inpatient waiting times on the list includes &quot; the time <lb/>elapsed for a patient on the non-emergency (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to <lb/>the waiting list for the procedure (following specialist assessment) to a designated census date &quot; . <lb/>4. Referral-to-treatment waiting time (from family doctor referral to treatment) of patients on the <lb/>list at a census date (publicly funded patients) <lb/>13. <lb/>This measure is analogous to Measure 3 but refers to the total waiting time of patients (starting <lb/>from GP/family doctor referral) on the list at a given census date (as opposed to the patients treated in a <lb/>given year). <lb/>14. <lb/>Reported measures of waiting times refer to either of two distributions: i) the distribution of <lb/>waiting times of patients treated in a given period (for example, a financial year); ii) the distribution of <lb/>waiting times of the patients on the list at a point in time (a census date). The first distribution measures the <lb/>full duration of the patient&apos;s waiting time experience (from entering to exiting the list). The second <lb/>measure of waiting times of patients on the list is instead &quot; incomplete &quot; , since the patient&apos;s wait has yet to <lb/>come to an end. The waiting time of patients treated has the advantage of capturing the full duration of a <lb/>patient&apos;s journey, but obviously is retrospective in nature. The main advantage of the waiting time of <lb/>patients on the list is that it captures the experience of the patients who are still waiting at a point in time <lb/>(Dixon and Siciliani, 2009). <lb/>15. <lb/>For each measure, we have collected the mean and median waiting time. We also collected <lb/>information on the proportion of patients waiting 0-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-9 months, 10-12 months, over <lb/>12 months. Although the mean and the median are more representative of the average patient&apos;s experience, <lb/>other measures, such as the proportion of patients waiting more than 9 months focus on patients who are <lb/>most disadvantaged, i.e. those with the longest wait (although if prioritisation works well, these are likely <lb/>to be patients with the lowest severity). <lb/>16. <lb/>Eight countries provided inpatient waiting times data for patients treated; six for inpatient on the <lb/>list. Only one country (Denmark) provided data on referral to treatment for patients treated (measure 2). <lb/>No country could provide data on referral to treatment for patients on the list (measure 4). Note that <lb/>referral-to-treatment waiting times are collected in England but not by surgical procedure (only by <lb/>specialty or for all specialties; see Siciliani, Borowitz and Moran, 2013, chapter 2, for a general discussion <lb/>and example of different measures). We did not attempt to collect data at specialty level (ophthalmology, <lb/>orthopaedics, etc.) since definitions of specialties across OECD countries may differ significantly. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>The mean waiting time can be substantially higher than the median <lb/>17. <lb/>Table 1 provides mean and median waiting times, measured in days, according to our three <lb/>definitions. Most countries could provide both the mean and median wait though some countries provided <lb/>only the median (Australia, Canada and Sweden) and others only the mean (the Netherlands and Spain). <lb/>Table 1a refers to 2011 and includes the largest number of countries, waiting-time definitions and <lb/>procedures. Table 1b refers to 2012 but includes only a subset of data. The results described below refer to <lb/>2011 (unless explicitly stated). <lb/></body>

Moreover, the difference can be quantitatively large. For example, in Finland <lb/>mean waiting times of patients treated for hip and knee replacement were 10-12% higher than the median; <lb/>it was 30% higher for cholecystectomy, and 39% higher for prostatectomy. In England and Scotland, the <lb/>mean waiting time was 8-34% higher depending on the procedure. In Portugal differences between mean <lb/>and median waiting times were generally higher than in other countries (as suggested below this may be <lb/>due a more significant proportion of long waiters). <lb/>19. <lb/>Across the five countries that report both mean and median waiting time for patients treated in <lb/>2011 (Finland, New Zealand, Portugal, England and Scotland) the correlation between mean and median <lb/></body>

			<body>wait for a given procedure, e.g. cataract, is very high (above 0.9 for seven out of nine procedures; it is <lb/>above 0.8 for cholecystectomy and is 0.73 for hip replacement; the last result is due to the larger difference <lb/>between the mean and the median in Portugal). This is also the case when correlating mean and median <lb/>waiting time for patients on the list. <lb/>Waiting times are low in the Netherlands and Denmark <lb/>20. <lb/>Among the countries reporting inpatient waiting times of patients treated (upper part of Table <lb/>1a), the Netherlands exhibits the lowest waiting times: mean waiting times are below one month and a half. <lb/>Notice that, even though we do not have the median waiting time for the Netherlands, the mean waiting <lb/>time (which is generally higher than the median) is lower in the Netherlands than the median in the other <lb/>countries which report inpatient waiting time of patients treated. <lb/>21. <lb/>Denmark, which measures waiting time from referral to treatment, also exhibits short waiting <lb/>times compared to the other countries that report the waiting times of patients treated. Despite their <lb/>measure including the additional wait from GP referral to specialist appointment, waiting times are lower <lb/>compared to most of the other countries. More precisely, if we exclude the Netherlands from the <lb/>comparison, Denmark has shorter waiting times for hip and knee replacement, hysterectomy and <lb/>cholecystectomy and hernia, compared to the countries reported in the upper part of Table 1a. <lb/>Table 1.b.

			<body>Waiting times of patients treated are systematically different from those of patients on the list <lb/>22. <lb/>Three countries (New Zealand, Portugal and Spain) report inpatient waiting times both for <lb/>patients treated and for patients on the list. The results show how generally the two measures provide <lb/>different results and are therefore not comparable. For New Zealand, the mean/median waiting time of <lb/>patients treated is generally higher than for those on the list (with the exception of coronary bypass in 2011 <lb/>and 2012 and median waiting time for PTCA in 2012). This is also the case for Spain. For Portugal this <lb/>holds only for one procedure in 2011 and 2012: knee replacement. The opposite holds for seven procedures <lb/>in 2011 and five procedures in 2012 with mean and median waiting time being lower for patients treated <lb/>than for those on the list. As mentioned above, the distribution of waiting times of patients on the list over-<lb/>samples long-waiting patients. Since Portugal has a longer tail of patients with long waiting times, this may <lb/>explain the different results for this country. <lb/>23. <lb/>The difference between mean (or median) waiting time for patients treated versus patients on the <lb/>list can be quantitatively large. For New Zealand the mean (median) waiting time for patients treated was <lb/>29-54% (35-66%) higher than the wait of patients on the list when including hip and knee replacement, <lb/>cataract surgery, hysterectomy and prostatectomy in 2012. In Spain it was 20-37% higher among the five <lb/>procedures available in 2011. Even when the waiting time of patients on the list is higher, as is the case for <lb/>Portugal, differences can be large: for example the mean (median) waiting time of patients on the list for <lb/>hip replacement, cataract and prostatectomy was 21-45% (15-35%) higher than the waiting time of patients <lb/>treated in 2012. <lb/>24. <lb/>In Sweden waiting times are provided only for four procedures. They appear generally low <lb/>compared to the other countries with a median waiting time for hip, knee replacement, cataract surgery and <lb/>coronary bypass of 43, 45, 40 and 25 days respectively. <lb/>25. <lb/>Slovenia reports relatively long waiting times compared to any other country, in particular for hip <lb/>and knee replacement, and PTCA. The mean waiting time for hip replacement is close to one year (354 <lb/>days) and for knee replacement well above one year (512 days). Waiting times are lower for cataract <lb/>surgery and in line with other countries (63 days) and similarly for cholecystectomy and hernia <lb/>(comparable to Ireland and lower than Portugal). <lb/>26. <lb/>Similarly, with respect to the distribution of waiting times of patients on the list the mean wait is <lb/>systematically higher than the median. For example, for hip replacement it was about 9-44% higher in <lb/>Ireland, New Zealand and Portugal in 2012. For cataract surgery it was 10-40% higher in the same <lb/>countries in 2012. In Slovenia the differences were smaller (1-33%) for hip and knee replacement, and <lb/>cataract surgery in 2012. The largest difference was for prostatectomy in Portugal where mean waiting <lb/>times were 98% higher than the median in 2012. <lb/>There is evidence of prioritization across treatments <lb/>27. <lb/>There is a clear evidence of prioritization across different treatments and procedures. Waiting <lb/>times for more urgent procedures, such as coronary bypass and PTCA, are generally lowest or among the <lb/>lowest (with median waiting times generally below one month and only occasionally below two months). <lb/>Instead, median waiting times are higher for less urgent procedures. At the other end of the spectrum, <lb/>median waiting times of three months are common across several countries for hip replacement, and in <lb/>some cases longer than three months for knee replacement which generally exhibits the longest wait. <lb/>Median waiting times are generally intermediate for hysterectomy and prostatectomy: they are above one <lb/>month though they can reach three months. These procedures are arguably more urgent than hip and knee <lb/>replacements but less urgent (on average) than coronary bypass. These results are not surprising. Doctors <lb/>are trained to prioritize patients on the waiting list. Moreover, there is an increasing policy focus on <lb/></body>

			<body>developing guidelines to improve prioritization of patients on the list across the OECD countries, but in <lb/>particular New Zealand, Canada, Norway and other Nordic countries (Siciliani, Borowitz and Moran, <lb/>2013, chapter 3). <lb/>Waiting times are not always highly correlated across procedures <lb/>28. <lb/>We may ponder the extent to which a country that has long waiting times for one particular <lb/>procedure (e.g. hip replacement) is also more likely to have long waiting times for other procedures (e.g. <lb/>cataract, coronary bypass), as a result for example, of a tighter capacity constraint across the whole system. <lb/>We show that in some instances such correlations are high but they are sensitive to the sample of countries <lb/>considered and the measure considered (e.g. the mean or median). <lb/>29. <lb/>We computed the correlation across eight procedures (excluding PTCA since data coverage is <lb/>less compared to other procedures) for the six countries that reported mean waiting time for patients treated <lb/>(Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland and England) in 2011. Excluding coronary <lb/>bypass and cataract surgery, the correlations among the remaining six procedures were relatively high -<lb/>above 0.65. Cataract surgery had a correlation that ranged between 0.44 (with cholecystectomy) and 0.82 <lb/>(with hysterectomy). Coronary bypass generally exhibits low correlation with the other procedures and a <lb/>wide range -between -0.36 (with prostatectomy) and 0.50 (with cataract surgery). This is due to England <lb/>and Scotland having relatively longer waiting times for coronary bypass compared to the other countries, <lb/>while performing well on the other procedures. The results were similar when Spain was included in the <lb/>sample for the five procedures available for this country. <lb/>30. <lb/>When using the median waiting time of patients treated correlations across procedures were <lb/>generally lower. When including six countries (Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland and <lb/>England), correlations were above 0.5 in only four out of 28 possible correlations among the eight <lb/>procedures (hip/knee, hip/cataract, knee/hernia, hernia/cholecystectomy). Correlations were in the range <lb/>0.3-0.5 in seven instances, and otherwise lower than 0.3. Waiting times for coronary bypass were generally <lb/>negatively correlated with waiting times for other procedures. <lb/>31. <lb/>The difference in the results between the correlations of mean waiting times across procedures <lb/>(highly correlated) and median waiting times across procedures (not highly correlated) is due to two <lb/>factors. First, the sample of countries considered is different (i.e. excluding/including the Netherlands in <lb/>the second/first measure and including/excluding Australia in the second/first measure). Second, Portugal <lb/>exhibits a much larger difference between mean and median waiting times compared to the other countries. <lb/>32. <lb/>When considering the patients on the list, a similar picture generally emerges. For example, the <lb/>correlation between median waiting times for hip and knee replacement across five countries (Ireland, New <lb/>Zealand, Portugal, Sweden and Slovenia) in 2011 is 0.99 but the correlation between hip (or knee) <lb/>replacement and cataract is close to zero. This is due to Ireland having relatively longer waiting times for <lb/>cataract (118 days) against a similar wait for hip/knee replacement and Slovenia having relatively shorter <lb/>waiting times for cataracts (58 days) against waiting times close to or over a year for hip and knee <lb/>replacement. Similarly, the correlation between mean waiting times between hip replacement and cataract <lb/>is -0.2 across five countries (Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Slovenia; note inclusion of Spain <lb/>and exclusion of Sweden) in 2011. This is again due to Ireland having relatively longer waiting times (144 <lb/>days) for cataract and Slovenia having relatively shorter waiting times (63 days). <lb/>Distribution of waiting times <lb/>33. <lb/>We can gain some further insights by looking at the distribution of waiting times. This allows <lb/>focusing also on the tail of the distribution and the long waiters. We provide histograms that show the <lb/></body>

			<body>proportion of patients waiting less than 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, between 6 and 9 months, <lb/>between 9 and 12 months, and over 12 months. We focus on hip replacement and cataract surgery. <lb/>34. <lb/>Figure 1.a shows the distribution of waiting times of patients treated for hip replacement. The <lb/>histograms show that the distribution of waiting times is skewed. Most patients get treatment quickly with <lb/>more than 50% of patients being treated within 3 months in the UK, Portugal and New Zealand (but not in <lb/>Finland). Most of the remaining patients are treated within 6 months (with the exception of Portugal). <lb/>There is a tail of patients waiting more than 6 months: it around 6-7% in the UK, 15-18% in New Zealand <lb/>and Finland, and 28% in Portugal. <lb/>Figure 1.a. Hip replacement. Patients treated (2011) <lb/>35. <lb/>The distribution can differ significantly across countries. An interesting comparison is between <lb/>Portugal and New Zealand. They both have a median waiting time for hip replacement of about 3 months. <lb/>However, the proportion of patients waiting over 6 months is 15% in New Zealand and 28% in Portugal <lb/>leading to a larger mean waiting time in Portugal (128 days) than in New Zealand (104 days). This <lb/>example shows how synthetic measures such as the median can hide significant variations in the <lb/>distribution. <lb/>36. <lb/>We can also compare the distribution of patients treated (Figure 1.a) versus the distribution of <lb/>patients on the list (Figure 1.b). New Zealand and Portugal report both distributions. The comparison of <lb/>Figure 1.a with Figure 1.b for hip replacement show how these distributions differ. In New Zealand, the <lb/>proportion of patients treated waiting more than 6 months is about 15% but the proportion of patients on <lb/>the list waiting more than 6 months is only 6%. This is not surprising. As mentioned above, the distribution <lb/>of patients on the list suffers from &apos;interruption&apos; bias (it measures an incomplete wait), which biases the <lb/>measure downwards, and reflects &apos;oversampling&apos; of long-wait patients, which biases the measure upwards. <lb/>Although these biases go in opposite directions, there is no reason why these should be the same. Notice <lb/>however how in some cases the figures between the two distributions may not be too dissimilar. For <lb/>example, for Portugal the proportion of patients waiting more than 6 months is in the range 27-28% under <lb/>both distributions. Similarly, the proportion of patients waiting more than 12 months is around 11-12%. <lb/>65 <lb/>57 <lb/>55 <lb/>51 <lb/>40 <lb/>29 <lb/>37 <lb/>18 <lb/>33 <lb/>42 <lb/>5 <lb/>5 <lb/>11 <lb/>14 <lb/>13 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>5 <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>12 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>8 <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>UK -<lb/>Scotland <lb/>UK -England Portugal <lb/>New <lb/>Zealand <lb/>Finland <lb/>Australia <lb/>% <lb/>% waiting 0-3 months <lb/>% of patients waiting 3-6 months <lb/>% of patients waiting 6-9 months <lb/>% of patients waiting 9-12 months <lb/>% of patients waiting over 12 months <lb/></body>

			<body>Time trends <lb/>40. <lb/>Time trends show that waiting times have been relatively stable in most countries and across <lb/>procedures. There are however several cases where waiting times have reduced. In particular, the United <lb/>Kingdom and Finland have experienced large reductions in waiting times from a relatively high level in the <lb/>early 2000s. There are also declining trends for the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal although this trend <lb/>has reversed in recent years in Portugal. <lb/>41. <lb/>In Finland waiting times are generally stable or increasing up to 2002 or 2003 and then <lb/>characterized by a sharp reduction the following years. The reduction is substantial: about 43-48% for hip <lb/>and knee replacement, 30-51% for prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and hernia, 55% for <lb/>cataract and 24% for bypass. The reduction in waiting times follows the introduction of a National Health <lb/>Care Guarantee introduced into Finnish law in 2005 (Jonsson, et al, 2013). For elective treatment the <lb/>guarantee was three months (with few exceptions). Hospitals that failed to comply with the guarantee were <lb/>scrutinized by the Supervisory Agency (known as Valvira) and were subject to a threat of penalty fines. <lb/>The reductions in waiting times were associated with an increase in health expenditure for municipalities in <lb/>the first years of the guarantee (Jonsson, et al, 2013). <lb/>42. <lb/>In the United Kingdom waiting times have been gradually falling starting from 2001/2002. Both <lb/>England and Scotland experienced a large gradual reduction in waiting times over a ten-year span. In <lb/>England waiting times more than halved for several procedures. In Scotland reductions in waiting times <lb/>were of the order 25-40% for several procedures. In 1999 waiting times were generally longer in England <lb/>than in Scotland. By 2011 waiting times were comparable. Waiting times have therefore fallen more <lb/>rapidly in England than in Scotland. There are two main explanations for these results. First, the United <lb/>Kingdom has experienced a sustained growth in health expenditure in the last decade. In 2000 health <lb/>expenditure was recognized to be low compared to other European and OECD countries, and policymakers <lb/>committed to increase expenditure to catch up with the other countries. Second, both England and Scotland <lb/>made use of waiting-time targets. These were however introduced at different times and with different <lb/>degrees of penalties. In England, heavy sanctions for hospitals not respecting the waiting-time targets were <lb/>introduced from 2000, a policy known as &quot; targets and terror &quot; (Propper et al, 2008, 2010): senior health <lb/>administrators were at risk of losing their jobs if targets were not met. This may explain why reductions in <lb/>waiting times in England were larger than for Scotland. Although in Scotland hospitals were not subject to <lb/>economic penalties, regional health boards from 2003-2004 were monitored monthly on the achievement <lb/>of waiting time targets. Individual breaches had to be reported to the Scottish Executive and were <lb/>investigated (Smith and Sutton, 2013). The UK has also experienced moderate increases in recent years for <lb/>all procedures except hysterectomy. <lb/>43. <lb/>In New Zealand waiting times of patients treated have been fairly stable over the period 2003-<lb/>2011 for several procedures. Hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and hernia experienced some increases, and <lb/>coronary bypass some reductions in recent years. The dynamics of waiting times for patients on the list <lb/>looks however rather different. Over the same period, the waiting time of the patients on the list has more <lb/>than halved for most procedures. One explanation for the different time trends is that the waiting time of <lb/>patients on the list includes also patients that ultimately do not receive treatment. As time passes, providers <lb/>may become more active at &apos;validating&apos; the waiting list and/or regularly checking that patients on the list <lb/>still require treatment, i.e. quickly removing patients from the list when it becomes apparent that treatment <lb/>is no longer necessary (see Cumming, 2013 for more details). <lb/>44. <lb/>In the Netherlands, waiting times have reduced over the period 2006-2011 for hip and knee <lb/>replacement, cataract, and to a lower extent coronary bypass while they were stable for the remaining <lb/>procedures, and increased slightly for cholecystectomy and hernia. As mentioned above, waiting times in <lb/>the Netherlands are low compared to other countries and have been low for at least five years. Compared to <lb/></body>

			<body>similar figures for year 2000 provided by Siciliani and Hurst (2004), waiting times have significantly <lb/>reduced and more than halved for several procedures. The reductions between 2000 and 2006 were <lb/>achieved following a radical change in the hospital financing system which switched from fixed budgets to <lb/>activity-based funding (Schut and Varkevisser, 2013). Additional reductions in recent years can be <lb/>attributed to a reform of specialist payments leading to a change from lump-sum payments to activity-<lb/>based payments in 2008, and an expansion of price competition (as part of a broader managed competition <lb/>reform) since 2005 (Schut and Varkevisser, 2013). As a result of these reforms, waiting times are not a <lb/>significant health policy issue as they were in the 1990s. Concerns have however, been raised about the <lb/>rapid growth in health expenditure that activity-based financing has promoted. <lb/>45. <lb/>In Denmark, we observe reductions for hip and knee replacement (by more than 30%), <lb/>prostatectomy (about 20%) and some modest reductions for cholecystectomy over the period 2005-2011, <lb/>increases for cataract (by more than 50%), while are relatively constant for the other procedures. As <lb/>mentioned above, waiting times are generally low compared to other OECD countries. Waiting times have <lb/>been a persistent focus of Danish health policy. A key policy has been &quot; free choice &quot; of hospital provider <lb/>for patients. The scheme implies that if the hospital can foresee that the maximum waiting time cannot be <lb/>fulfilled, then the patient can choose another public or private hospital, either within or outside Denmark <lb/>(Christiansen and Beck, 2013). In 2002 the maximum waiting time guarantee was two months (and <lb/>replaced a former guarantee of three months). The guarantee was further reduced to four weeks in 2007 <lb/>(independent of disease type and severity). &quot; Free choice &quot; was suspended in 2008-09 due to a hospital <lb/>personnel strike (Christiansen and Beck, 2013). <lb/>46. <lb/>We also observe reductions in waiting times across most procedures for Portugal although these <lb/>reductions started to reverse in 2011 for most procedures with the exception of hysterectomy. The recent <lb/>increases in waiting times are most pronounced for patients treated. Reductions in waiting times were <lb/>obtained through a series of policy initiatives which included a new integrated information system <lb/>combined with a voucher system for patients reaching 75% of max waiting time guarantee (Barros et al., <lb/>2013). We also note sharp reductions for the patients on the list between 2006 and 2007 which, similar to <lb/>the experience in New Zealand, were possibly obtained by more accurate validation of the waiting list (this <lb/>is also reminiscent of the English experience in the early eighties, see Siciliani and Hurst, 2005). <lb/>47. <lb/>Ireland has witnessed considerable reductions in waiting times of patients on the list -<lb/>particularly over the time-period 2007-2008 – for hip and knee replacement, prostatectomy and <lb/>cholecystectomy. Similar to Portugal and New Zealand, these sharp decreases can in part be attributed to <lb/>some cleaning of the waiting list by removing patients no longer available for treatment from the list <lb/>(Moran et al., 2013). In contrast, there was an increase in waiting times for cataract surgery during 2010-<lb/>2012 and hysterectomy during 2010-2011. There was a particularly sharp increase for coronary bypass <lb/>surgery from 2009-2010 but this subsequently decreased in 2011 and rose again in 2012. <lb/>48. <lb/>Waiting times in Spain have been either stable or reduced to some extent in recent years (2003-<lb/>2011) but have increased in 2012 for cataract, prostatectomy and hip replacement. This is reflected in both <lb/>the wait of patients treated and on the list. A number of policy initiatives have been introduced, mainly <lb/>targeting the supply side, and include extending working hours for health personnel, additional resources <lb/>and the introduction of ambulatory surgery centres (García-Goñi and Costa-Font, 2013). <lb/>49. <lb/>In Australia, median waiting times for patients treated have generally gradually increased over <lb/>the period 2002-2012, sometimes significantly (knee replacement, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy by 32-<lb/>47%, prostatectomy and hernia by 41-58%) but have been stable for cataract and coronary bypass. In <lb/>Canada, data are available only over the 4-year period 2008-2011 for selected procedures. Median waiting <lb/>times for hip and knee replacement have been moderately increasing (by less than 10% over five years), <lb/>and have been relatively stable for cataract. In Sweden, data are available only for two years, 2010 and <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Conclusions <lb/>50. <lb/>The analysis provides new comparative evidence on waiting times across OECD countries. <lb/>Waiting times appear to be low in the Netherlands and Denmark. The United Kingdom (in particular <lb/>England), Finland and the Netherlands have witnessed large reductions in waiting times in the last decade <lb/>which can be attributed to a range of policy initiatives, including higher spending, waiting-times target <lb/>schemes, and incentive mechanisms which reward higher levels of activity. <lb/>51. <lb/>The negative trend in waiting times seems however to have been halted and reverted in some <lb/>countries in recent years. These increases have been most pronounced for Portugal in 2011 and 2012 for <lb/>most procedures. The UK (England and Scotland) has also experienced increases in most procedures albeit <lb/>to a lesser extent than Portugal. There were increases in waiting times in Spain – particularly in 2012 – for <lb/>cataract, prostatectomy and hip replacement while Finland has also had increases in waiting times for <lb/>CABG, hernia and knee replacement in the latest available years. <lb/>52. <lb/>Policymakers have at their disposal a range of measures to collect waiting times. The study <lb/>emphasizes the presence of systematic differences across different waiting time measures, in particular <lb/>between the distribution of waiting times of patients treated versus the distribution of patients on the list. <lb/>For example, the mean waiting time of patients on the list is generally higher than of patients treated <lb/>although we can find examples of the opposite (and similarly for other measures such as the proportion <lb/>waiting over a certain time threshold, e.g. six months). Mean waiting times are systematically higher than <lb/>median waiting times due to a skewed distribution and this difference can be quantitatively large in some <lb/>countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>APPENDIX <lb/>SECTION A1. DEFINITIONS <lb/>Measure 1: Inpatient waiting time of patients treated (publicly funded patients) and distribution of <lb/>waiting time by main surgical procedures <lb/>Inpatient waiting times at admission for treatment includes &quot; the time elapsed for a patient on the non-<lb/>emergency (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to the waiting list for the <lb/>procedure (following specialist assessment) to the date they were admitted to an inpatient or day-case <lb/>surgical unit for the procedure to be carried out &quot; . <lb/>This definition of waiting time does NOT include &apos;the time elapsed from the date of referral of the <lb/>general practitioner to the date of specialist assessment&apos; (in some countries referred to as &apos;outpatient <lb/>waiting time&apos;). <lb/>Inpatient waiting times are requested for 11 main surgical procedures (Cataract surgery, Percutaneous <lb/>transluminal coronary angioplasty, Coronary bypass, Cholecystectomy, Inguinal and femorial hernia, <lb/>Prostatectomy, Vaginal hysterectomy, Knee arthroscopy, Total and partial hip replacement, Knee <lb/>replacement, Ligation and stripping of varicose veins). To classify the surgical procedures, we follow the <lb/>international classification system ICD-9-CM. If you are not able to provide the data according to the ICD-<lb/>9-CM format, please specify which classification (national or international) you have used and, if possible, <lb/>provide cross-classification (codes of your national system and corresponding codes to ICD-9-CM). <lb/>The inpatient waiting times should refer to all &apos;publicly funded patients&apos;. More precisely, the inpatient <lb/>waiting times refers to all &apos;publicly funded patients&apos; that received the treatment either by publicly or <lb/>privately (non-profit and for-profit) owned providers. <lb/>Publicly funded patients include &quot; the patients whose expenditure is incurred by public funds (OECD <lb/>Health data definition, 2010). Public funds are state, regional and local Government bodies (included are <lb/>non-market, non-profit institutions that are controlled and mainly financed by government units) and social <lb/>security schemes. (Social security funds are social insurance programmes covering the community as a <lb/>whole or large sections of the community that are imposed and controlled by a government unit. They <lb/>generally involve compulsory contributions by employees or employers or both, and the terms on which <lb/>benefits are paid to recipients are determined by a government unit). Note that in some countries &apos;publicly <lb/>funded patients&apos; may receive the treatment also in private (non-profit or for-profit) institutions. &quot; <lb/>Privately funded patients include &quot; the patients whose treatments are funded by private sources <lb/>including out-of-pocket payments, private insurance programmes, charities and occupational health care. <lb/>Expenditure on health incurred by private insurance funds includes both private social insurance and all <lb/>other private insurance funds &quot; . <lb/></body>

			<body>The waiting times figures should cover the largest share of patients in the country, ideally the whole <lb/>population of publicly funded patients. <lb/>Measure 2: Total waiting times of patients treated (publicly-funded patients) and distribution of <lb/>total waiting time <lb/>We are interested in the measurement of total waiting times and distribution of total waiting time for <lb/>publicly funded patients, comprising both &apos;inpatient waiting time at admission&apos; and &apos;outpatient waiting <lb/>time&apos;: <lb/>• Inpatient waiting times at admission for treatment includes &quot; the time elapsed for a patient on <lb/>the non-emergency (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to the waiting <lb/>list for the procedure (after specialist assessment) to the date they were admitted to an inpatient or <lb/>day-case surgical unit for the procedure &quot; .<lb/>• Outpatient waiting times includes &quot; the time elapsed from the Family Doctor (General <lb/>Practitioner) referral to the specialist visit &quot; .<lb/>• Total waiting times (inpatient + outpatient waiting times) therefore includes &quot; the time elapsed <lb/>from the Family Doctor (General Practitioner) referral to the date patients added on the non-<lb/>emergency (elective) surgery waiting list were admitted to an inpatient or day-case surgical unit <lb/>for the procedure &quot; .<lb/>Measure 3: Inpatient waiting time of patients on the list (publicly funded patients) and distribution <lb/>of waiting time by main surgical procedures <lb/>This measure refers to the patients on the list at a given census date (as opposed to the patients treated <lb/>in a given year). Ideally the census date is the 1 st July (or any census date which is closest to this, <lb/>depending on data availability). <lb/>Inpatient waiting times on the list includes &quot; the time elapsed for a patient on the non-emergency <lb/>(elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to the waiting list for the procedure (following <lb/>specialist assessment) to a designated census date &quot; . <lb/></body>

			<body>http://waittimes.cihi.ca/. The reports have been published for the past 7 years. However, Provinces began <lb/>submitting according to a standard definition in 2008 (4 years ago). Provinces submit data for wait times <lb/>for hip replacements, knee replacements, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), cataract surgery, <lb/>radiation therapy, MRI and CT scans. This data is from provincial registries or chart audits. Some <lb/>provinces such as Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador do not have registries. The <lb/>reference period for the data is April 1st through September 30th of each year or the nearest 6 month proxy <lb/>for provinces unable to produce data for the reference period. <lb/>Coverage: Data coverage includes most provincial institutions or outpatient clinics where procedures <lb/>are performed. Population inclusions and exclusions are noted below for each procedure. CIHI calculates <lb/>provincial volumes for each procedure and cross-checks with volumes provided by provinces to ensure <lb/>coverage matches definitions agreed to. <lb/>Deviation from the definition: Data supplied is for the wait times for procedure from &apos;the booking <lb/>date of surgery to date of procedure.&apos; The booking date will be after assessment by a specialist but may <lb/>have a time lapse between this appointment (or the decision to treat) and the booking date. Provinces are <lb/>working towards reducing the time between &quot;ready to treat&quot; and &quot;booking date&quot; through system <lb/>efficiencies. <lb/>Estimation: The median waiting time is an estimation of weighted median for all procedures. The 10 <lb/>provinces provide CIHI with summary level data and volumes. Using the volumes and summary level data <lb/>we calculate an &quot;all Canada&quot; median wait for hips, knees, CABG, cataracts, and radiation. Waiting times <lb/>are based on the ICD-10-CA/CCI Classification system. The codes are based on inclusions and exclusions <lb/>to the procedure definitions. Provinces will use the coding to link provincial registry data with the DAD for <lb/>quality checks. <lb/>Further information: http://waittimes.cihi.ca/ <lb/>England <lb/>Source of data: Hospital Episodes Statistics, The Health and Care Information Centre.

			<body>-over 90% of data to Dec 2011 complete; NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde -IRH complete to Sep 2011; <lb/>VoL complete to Feb 2012. <lb/>Estimation: This analysis is using SMR01 data so that procedure level analysis can be provided. <lb/>Waiting times analysis from SMR01 cannot be adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical /social <lb/>unavailability. ISD National Statistics for hospital waiting times come from the source New Ways.

In NHS Scotland, procedures are recorded using the OPCS-4 classification. The OPCS-4 <lb/>procedure codes used to define the procedure groupings were as followed: CATARACT: C71, C72, C74, <lb/>C75; KNEE REPLACEMENT: W40, W41, W420, W421, W422, W423, W425, W427, W428, W429, <lb/>O180, O181, O182, O183, O185, O186, O187, O188, O189; HIP: W37, W38, W46, W47, W93, W94, <lb/>W390, W391, W392, W393, W395, W397, W398, W399, W480, W481, W482, W483, W486, W487, <lb/>W488, W489, W950, W951, W952, W953, W955, W956, W957, W958, W959; HYSTERECTOMY: <lb/>Q08; PTCA: K49, K75, K501; CORONARY BYPASS: K40, K41, K42, K43, K44, K46; <lb/>PROSTATECTOMY: M61. <lb/>Further information: www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Hospital-Care <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Source of data: Nationella väntetidsdatabasen Sveriges Kommuner och Landsting (SKL), National <lb/>waiting time database Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR). <lb/>Deviation from the definition: Just Total Hip Replacement (partial hip not included). <lb/>Estimation: We do not know the exact waiting times for any patient, and we therefore only give an <lb/>estimated number for the median, as we cannot compute either the mean or the median exactly. Mean <lb/>waiting time cannot be calculated. In Sweden waiting times are presented in intervals, in the sense that we <lb/>only know which of the intervals 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 121-180, 181-365 and 365-infinity a data <lb/>point belongs to. We do not know how many days each patient has been waiting and because of that we <lb/>cannot calculate mean waiting time. Estimation of the median waiting time. From the binned data we can <lb/>compute which interval the median belongs to, and we attempt to estimate if the median is in the lower, <lb/>middle, or upper part of the interval, which allows us to arrive at a number for the estimated median. We <lb/>do not have a well-defined procedure for the estimation of the median within the interval, and we have not <lb/>attempted to estimate the expected error in our procedure. The point in the interval at which the median lies <lb/>has been estimated on the assumption that waiting times are normally distributed within the interval. <lb/>The estimation of the median waiting time was done as follows: <lb/>• The total number of patients waiting was divided by two. We thereafter identified in which <lb/>waiting-time interval the middle patient (the median) occurs.<lb/>• To get an estimation of the median waiting time we have put that number in relation to the ranges <lb/>around.<lb/>• The following ICD-9-CM codes are used:<lb/>Cataract surgery:13.1-13.7 &amp; 13.90; Coronary bypass:36.1; Total and partial hip replacement <lb/>(includes the revision of hip replacement): 81.51-81.53; Knee replacement (includes the revision of knee <lb/>replacement): 81.54-81.55. <lb/></body>
