			<p>The migration of women is a growing phenomenon in most countries: about half of all<lb/> international migrants are women. The push and pull factors influencing this significant share of<lb/> migration have typically been explained as a by-product of male migration: female migrants<lb/> have been assumed to migrate mainly for reasons of family reunification as dependents of male<lb/> migrants as wives, daughters or mothers. Over the years, the body of knowledge on the<lb/> migration of women seeking better employment opportunities has increased, including research<lb/> on topics such the role of gender discrimination in the workplace. Despite this growing<lb/> knowledge, information on the links between migration and discriminatory social institutions<lb/> has been neglected in the economic literature. The causes, processes and impacts of migration on<lb/> women and men are expected to be different. By defining which decisions and behaviours are<lb/> acceptable for each gender, as well as restricting women&apos;s access to power and resources. Hence,<lb/> studying migration from a gender perspective implies looking beyond the differences in<lb/> migration behaviour between men and women, such as the likelihood and type of migration, and<lb/> to examine further the inequalities underlying those differences.<lb/> This paper assesses how South-South migration and gender discrimination in social<lb/> institutions mutually influence one another. Gender discrimination in both the origin and<lb/> destination country appears to be an additional push and pull factor for female migrants. In<lb/> addition, the relevance of international migration goes well beyond the movement of people as<lb/> migration also represents a powerful mechanism to transmit ideas across borders. This<lb/> contributes to a better understanding of why discriminatory laws, attitudes and practices persist<lb/> and how social transformation and shifts in discriminatory social institutions can occur. In<lb/> addition to the fulfilment of fundamental rights for women and girls, gender equality has<lb/> recently been hailed as a &apos;breakthrough&apos; strategy for promoting inclusive development and<lb/> reducing poverty. Understanding the nature and extent of the obstacles to gender equality is<lb/> therefore critical to designing effective policies to promote equality between men and women,<lb/> and consequently, to improving development outcomes.<lb/> Using the innovative OECD Development Centre&apos;s Social Institutions and Gender Index<lb/> (SIGI), this paper provides evidence of a vicious circle. Higher levels of discriminatory<lb/> institutions in origin countries hinder the likelihood of female migration, reducing the migrant<lb/> share in origin populations, which consequently is too low to positively shift discriminatory<lb/> norms towards greater gender equality.<lb/></p>

D&apos;un côté, le niveau de discrimination de genre dans les<lb/> institutions sociales du pays d&apos;origine et du pays d&apos;accueil influence significativement la<lb/> migration des femmes dans les pays du Sud. Ainsi les discriminations auxquelles les femmes<lb/> font faces dans les lois formelles et informelles, les normes sociales et pratiques coutumières dans<lb/> leurs pays d&apos;origine constituent un déterminant supplémentaire à la migration : lorsque les<lb/> discriminations dans les pays d&apos;origine sont trop fortes, elles entravent les opportunités de<lb/> migration des femmes et réduisent ainsi les flux migratoires Sud-Sud. En outre, le niveau de<lb/> discrimination dans les institutions sociales des pays d&apos;origine semblent aussi jouer un rôle<lb/> important, les femmes étant attirés par des pays ayant des niveaux de discrimination plus faibles<lb/> que dans leurs pays d&apos;origine.

Alors que les flux migratoires vers des destinations à faibles niveaux de<lb/> discrimination favorisent l&apos;égalité de genre dans les pays d&apos;origine, ceux dirigés vers des<lb/> destinations ayant des niveaux de discriminations élevés renforcent les inégalités homme-femme<lb/> dans les institutions sociales.<lb/> Cet article utilise un indicateur novateur développé par le Centre de Développement de<lb/> l&apos;OCDE mesurant les inégalités de genre dans les institutions sociales d&apos;une centaine de pays : le<lb/> SIGI (Social Institutions and Gender Index).

			<p>Centre, this paper provides evidence of the two-way relationship between gender inequality in<lb/> social institutions and South-South migration. Discriminatory social institutions in both origin<lb/> and destination countries are one additional determinant of female migration. Gender inequality<lb/> appears to be both a pull and a push factor for migrant women. On one hand, higher gender<lb/> discrimination at home reduces female emigration, since women&apos;s restricted opportunities and<lb/> low decision-power limit their possibility to move abroad. On the other hand, lower<lb/> discrimination in the destination country attracts female immigration. However, they have no<lb/> significant impact on male migration, suggesting that male and female incentives to migrate<lb/> differ.<lb/> In addition, migration appears to be a driver of cultural change regarding gender<lb/> inequality in opportunities, according to the level of discriminatory social institutions in the<lb/> destination country. Migration towards countries having low levels of discrimination promotes<lb/> gender equality in social institutions in the origin country, while migration towards countries<lb/> having high levels of discrimination has the reverse effect, whatever the gender of the migrant.<lb/> This paper contributes to a better understanding of why gender inequalities persist. These<lb/> results are robust to changes in specifications and controls for potential endogeneity and<lb/> simultaneity bias.<lb/></p>

			<head>I. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>There is widespread consensus that gender equality is a prerequisite for development,<lb/> economic growth and poverty reduction. In recent decades, policy makers and researchers have<lb/> increasingly turned attention and resources to closing gender gaps on key economic and social<lb/> indicators. Discriminatory social institutions, defined as formal and informal laws, social norms<lb/> and practices that shape or restrict the decisions, choices and behaviours of women (<ref type="biblio">Jütting et al.,<lb/> 2008</ref>), have gained prominence as a useful analytical framework to illuminate gender disparities.<lb/> In parallel to the increasing focus on gender equality in social norms, the even bigger question of<lb/> how to measure and shift them has come to the fore.<lb/> The OECD Development Centre investigated these issues by building a unique composite<lb/> index. The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) was the first attempt to measure<lb/> discriminatory social institutions, which reduce female access to opportunities, resources and<lb/> power (<ref type="biblio">Cerise et al., 2012</ref>). Through its innovative focus on gender inequalities in opportunities,<lb/> the SIGI provides additional insights on the root causes of gender inequality (<ref type="biblio">Ferrant et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> Increasing attention on targeting discriminatory social norms and practices will not only<lb/> empower women and secure their fundamental human rights, but also contribute to economic<lb/> growth and development (<ref type="biblio">Ferrant et al., 2015</ref>).<lb/> Since gender is a social construct, which organises relationships between women and<lb/> men, the causes, processes and impacts of migration on women and men can be considered as<lb/> different. Hence, studying migration from a gender perspective implies looking beyond the<lb/> differences in migration behaviour between men and women, such as the likelihood and type of<lb/> migration, and to examine further the inequalities underlying those differences.<lb/> While the literature focuses on the impact of gender discrimination in the workplace on<lb/> female migration (<ref type="biblio">Kanaiaupuni, 2000; Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012</ref>), it neglects the key role of<lb/> discriminatory social institutions. By defining which decisions and behaviours are acceptable for<lb/> each gender, as well as restricting women&apos;s access to power and resources, discriminatory social<lb/> institutions affect migration decisions. Moreover, the relevance of international migration goes<lb/> well beyond the movement of people as migration also represents a powerful mechanism to<lb/> transmit ideas across borders.<lb/> Using the SIGI, this paper is the first attempt to investigate this two-way influence<lb/> between gender inequality in social institutions and migration. This exercise brings along a<lb/> threefold contribution. First, it highlights the gender differences in migration determinants. The<lb/> literature remains predominantly gender blind at cross-country level, assuming that migrants are<lb/></p>

			<table>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326<lb/> DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/> 9<lb/> a homogeneous group having the same incentives to migrate. This paper provides evidence that<lb/> differentials in discriminatory social institutions between origin and destination countries only<lb/> influence female migration. Indeed, high discrimination in social institutions in the home<lb/> communities restricts female emigration and low discrimination in the destination countries<lb/> attracts female immigration, while they have no significant effect on men.<lb/></table>

			<p>Second, this paper contributes to the migration literature on &quot; transfers of norms &quot;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Spilimbergo, 2009; Lodigiani and Salomone, 2012; Beine et al., 2013; Bertoli and Marchetta,<lb/> 2013</ref>). Migration may be a channel of norms transmission challenging gender inequality in social<lb/> institutions at home when moving towards countries with low levels of discrimination. It can<lb/> however reinforce discrimination when moving towards countries with high levels of<lb/> discrimination.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, this paper contributes to the small literature exploring the neglected issue of<lb/> South-South migration (<ref type="biblio">Gindling, 2009; Facchini et al., 2013</ref>). While Naghsh Nejad and Young<lb/> (2012) and Naghsh Nejad (2013) focus on institutionalised gender inequality in OECD countries,<lb/> this paper considers migration flows between developing regions. This is not only because<lb/> South-South migration represents more than 50% of migration stocks flows comparing to South-<lb/>North migration (<ref type="biblio">Ratha and Shaw, 2007</ref>), but also because discriminatory social institutions in<lb/> non-OECD countries are different and more restrictive than those in place in high-income areas<lb/> (such as female genital mutilation, early marriage, inheritance laws).<lb/> To investigate the two-way influence between gender inequality in social institutions and<lb/> migration, several econometric strategies are performed. First, the empirical analysis adopts a<lb/> Heckman two-step procedure to deal with the high occurrence of null bilateral flows in<lb/> migration data and the selection process. Then, 2SLS estimators are used to overcome potential<lb/> endogeneities, due to reverse causality and unobservables. Finally, the simultaneous influence of<lb/> gender inequality on migration and vice versa is estimated using 3SLS estimators.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper is structured as follows: the second section presents the theoretical links<lb/> between gender inequality in social institutions and migration, and the third section the data.<lb/> The fourth section describes the empirical strategy and the fifth section the empirical results.<lb/> Finally, the last section concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>II. THE EXPECTED LINKAGES BETWEEN MIGRATION<lb/> AND GENDER INEQUALITY<lb/></head>

			<p>The important role of gender inequality has been neglected by the literature. Few<lb/> exceptions have looked at gender inequality as a driver of female migration, with a particular<lb/> focus on discrimination in the workplace. <ref type="biblio">Kanaiaupuni (2000)</ref> studies whether the determinants<lb/> of migration differ by sex, using Mexico-US data. She finds that high-skilled women are more<lb/> likely to migrate than high-skilled men or low and moderate skilled women. This may be<lb/> explained by higher gender discrimination faced by women and few occupational rewards in<lb/> their home country, and thus they benefit more than men from migrating internationally,<lb/> whether their skill level is high enough to allow them to meet the job demand. Recently,<lb/> Baudassé and Bazillier (2012) suggest that non-wage motivations for emigration include gender<lb/> equality in the workplace. They assume that poor working conditions in source countries may be<lb/> considered as a determinant of emigration. Therefore, when gender discrimination in the local<lb/> labour market decreases, women&apos;s incentives to migrate decrease as well. They show that higher<lb/> levels of discrimination in the workplace are correlated with higher levels of female emigration<lb/> and lower levels of male emigration, suggesting a substitution effect between men and women<lb/> within a given number of migrants.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, women&apos;s decision to migrate and their choice of destination may be also<lb/> influenced by the discriminatory social institutions that impede their economic, political or social<lb/> expectations. Gender norms may also affect male migration by defining their role in the public<lb/> and private spheres. More specifically, discriminatory social institutions in origin countries may<lb/> influence women&apos;s decision to emigrate in two ways. On one hand, they can be an additional<lb/> determinant of emigration, stemming from women&apos;s need to escape gender-specific<lb/> discrimination. For example, women may migrate to escape sexual violence and abuse; single<lb/> women, widows and divorcees may migrate to escape social stigma; or girls may migrate to<lb/> escape restrictions on their freedom, pressure to marry, or to remain chaste until marriage (<ref type="biblio">Jolly<lb/> and Reeves, 2005</ref>). There is evidence from South-East Asia of women migrating in order to<lb/> escape from involuntary marriages (<ref type="biblio">Lam and Hoang, 2010</ref>). Another study in Ethiopia finds that<lb/> 23% of migrant girls reported to have migrated in order to escape early marriage in their home<lb/> communities (<ref type="biblio">Erulkar et al., 2006</ref>). The same mechanism is expected for men. Gender norms in<lb/> the household and society may push men to emigrate (<ref type="biblio">Hofmann, 2010</ref>). For example, young men<lb/> may leave the country to escape being forced to become soldiers; migration may be also seen as a<lb/> rite of passage for young men (<ref type="biblio">Jolly and Reeves, 2005</ref>).<lb/> On the other hand, gender inequality in social institutions may constraint the &quot; capability &quot;<lb/> itself for women to migrate.<lb/> 1 For example, a girl who marries early is less likely to finish her<lb/> education, which limits her employment opportunities (<ref type="biblio">Cerise et al., 2013</ref>), rendering her more<lb/> socially and financially dependent on her husband for a range of key factors, which include<lb/> migration possibilities. In the Republic of Moldova, women report having less opportunity to<lb/> migrate because of a lack of resources, which are generally more available to men (IOM, 2005).<lb/> As Jolly and Reeves (2005) note, &quot; it may be less acceptable for women to move about and travel<lb/> on their own &quot; . This negative correlation between discrimination in social institutions and male<lb/> emigration is not expected since patriarchal beliefs would be positively associated with<lb/> emigration for men (<ref type="biblio">Hofmann, 2010</ref>).<lb/> These roles of discriminatory social institutions in migration processes have been totally<lb/> disregarded by the economic literature. Few sociological and qualitative studies, however, have<lb/> shed light on the relevance of gender norms in driving migration decisions. <ref type="biblio">Diner (1983)</ref> is one of<lb/> the first attempts to include discriminatory social norms into the possible explanations of<lb/> women&apos;s international migration. Studying the Irish diaspora to the United States in the late<lb/> nineteenth century, she finds that most of the migrants were women in search for better<lb/> opportunities. Since the famine of those years made impossible for families to give dowry to each<lb/> daughter, marriage was only possible for one daughter. The unmarried sisters, then, had few<lb/> alternatives: employment opportunities in the countryside were scarce, and millions of young<lb/> Irish women migrated to seek fortune and family in America. A recent contribution by Hofmann<lb/> 1<lb/> <ref type="biblio">As Sen (1999)</ref> has noted, economic factors are not the only determinants for human well-being and<lb/> choices: desire for individual freedoms and rights to be respected and expanded also govern individual<lb/> decision-making. Applying Sen&apos;s &quot; capabilities &quot; approach to female migration, it is interesting to<lb/> explore how women&apos;s freedom (or lack of freedom) to &quot; achieve outcomes that they value &quot; may<lb/> influence their decision to emigrate and their choice of destination.<lb/></p>

			<head>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other?<lb/></head>

			<table>DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> 12<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/> and <ref type="biblio">Buckley (2013)</ref> stresses the possible negative role of social norms in limiting migration<lb/> opportunities for women. The authors use individual interviews in Georgia to study the<lb/> feminisation of migration that is currently taking place. Most respondents described female<lb/> migration as &quot; unnatural, challenging the male role as breadwinner and female responsibilities<lb/> for childcare and elder-care. Female migration is a crucial serious sociocultural loss, depriving<lb/> individual families, and Georgian society as a whole, of women&apos;s natural contributions &quot; .<lb/> Likewise, gender and social norms in countries of destination can also inter-relate with<lb/> women&apos;s decision to immigrate to a particular country, since women may be attracted by lower<lb/> levels of discrimination. For example, in the 19th Century in the Dominican Republic, due to<lb/> social stigma attached to women working outside of the household, the husband preferred and<lb/> encouraged women to seek employment in the US, where it was deemed acceptable, even in the<lb/> Dominican diaspora (<ref type="biblio">Grassmuck and Pessar, 1991</ref>). In addition to preferences for gender<lb/> equality, this attraction of lower discriminatory social institutions in the destination country may<lb/> also be explained by lower discrimination in its labour market reflected in greater working<lb/> opportunities for women (<ref type="biblio">Martin, 2004</ref>). Mechanically, this is the reverse for men: when women<lb/> are less discriminated, for a given level of job opportunities, men are less favoured. The hiring<lb/> conditions are based on productivity instead of the gender of the job candidate. For a given level<lb/> of labour demand, this may affect negatively the male probability to be hired. Hence, except if<lb/> men have preferences for gender equality, higher discrimination in social institutions in<lb/> destination countries is expected to be positively correlated with male migration.<lb/></p>

			<p>To summarise, while a positive effect of discriminatory social institutions in origin<lb/> countries on male emigration is expected, the sign of the linkage for women is still ambiguous.<lb/> Concerning the effect of gender discrimination in social institutions in host countries, a negative<lb/> effect for female immigration and a positive one for male migration are expected. Nonetheless,<lb/> the linkages between migration and gender inequality do not terminate here: migrants may be<lb/> agents of change for gender discrimination in social institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.2. Migration: A channel of norms transmission<lb/></head>

			<p>The chains of causality are complex and difficult to establish, making the explanation of<lb/> gender inequality and its persistence challenging. The standard explanation focuses on economic<lb/> growth as a determinant of gender inequality (<ref type="biblio">Forsythe et al., 2000</ref>). The positive effect of<lb/> economic growth is widely documented (see Dollar and Gatti (1999) and Ferrant (2015) among<lb/> others) although income growth by itself is not sufficient. Gender equality also depends on how<lb/> markets and formal/informal institutions have evolved, how growth has played out, and how all<lb/> these factors have interacted with household decisions (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2012</ref>). Interestingly, Rees<lb/> and Riezman (2012) wonder whether globalisation may influence gender equality. Following this<lb/> intuition and the migration literature on &quot; transfers of norms &quot; , the paper assumes that beyond the<lb/> movement of people, migration involves norm exchanges. For example, Spilimbergo (2009)<lb/> describes how student migration towards democratic countries promotes democracy at home. In<lb/> addition, migrants can also bring back home stronger entrepreneurial attitude (<ref type="biblio">Piracha and<lb/> Vadean, 2010; Demurger and Xu, 2011</ref>; <ref type="biblio">Wahba and Zenou, 2012</ref>) or influence fertility decisions<lb/></p>

			<figure>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326<lb/> DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/> 13<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Beine et al., 2013; Bertoli and Marchetta, 2013</ref>). However, the role of migration as an agent of<lb/> change for gender discrimination has been neglected by the economic literature.<lb/> Few exceptions have looked at migration as a driver of women&apos;s empowerment.<lb/> Lodigiani and Salomone (2012) investigate the linkage between transfers of norms through<lb/> migration and women&apos;s political empowerment. Diaspora contributes to the propagation of<lb/> political and gender equality values when migrants become aware of the fact that female political<lb/> conditions at origin countries and their consequences on governance are worse than those<lb/> experienced at destination. Hence, international migration to countries with higher female<lb/> parliamentary shares significantly increases women&apos;s political empowerment in origin countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Concerning other aspects of women&apos;s empowerment, several studies at micro or regional<lb/> level have stressed the existence of possible channels of gender equality promotion through<lb/> migration. For example, Hadi (2001) explains that male migration has a significant positive effect<lb/> on women&apos;s empowerment. Changes in women&apos;s position are measured by three indicators:<lb/> women&apos;s decision-making capacity; girls&apos; education; and the practice of dowry. Findings show<lb/> that male out-migration not only raise the standard of living of their left-behind kin through the<lb/> injection of remittances, but also &quot; modify their social behaviour through the diffusion of secular<lb/> ideas into the traditional values of the sending communities. &quot; Moreover, Hadi (2001) also shows<lb/> that households with female migrant members are more concerned with the education of<lb/> daughters. In Uttar Pradesh <ref type="biblio">Paris et al. (2005)</ref> shed light on the consequences of male migration<lb/> on gender roles in farming households. Interviewed women explain that the gender division of<lb/> labour shifted, since they now have to take over several male-specific activities. Moreover, wives<lb/> in migrant families state to have higher decision-making power, with the decision of how much<lb/> money to invest and what crops to grow lying in their hands. Similarly, evidence from Nicaragua<lb/> shows that fathers assume new gender roles when their spouses migrate, taking charge of the<lb/> housework and children (<ref type="biblio">Avellan, 2003</ref>).<lb/> This paper contributes to the literature by assuming that South-South migration may<lb/> foster gender equality in social institutions in the home community through three channels.<lb/> Firstly, remittances and other benefits for the household and the community make the benefits of<lb/> female emigration more obvious, which in turn creates incentives to increase the women&apos;s ability<lb/> to migrate through improvement in women&apos;s access to opportunities, resources and power. For<lb/> example, women who send remittances gain more respect within their family and community<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Jolly and Reeves, 2005</ref>). Moreover, parents who rely on their daughters&apos; remittances are less<lb/> likely to force them to return home to marry (<ref type="biblio">Temin et al., 2013)</ref>). Likewise, women gain financial<lb/> independence and increased decision-making power when they emigrate (<ref type="biblio">Peleah, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Secondly, social remittances may translate in a shift in attitudes towards less<lb/> discriminatory practices. Specifically, social remittance exchanges occur when migrants return to<lb/> live in or visit their communities of origin, when non-migrants visit migrants abroad, or through<lb/> the exchange of e-mails, blog posts and telephone calls (<ref type="biblio">Levitt, 1998</ref>). In this way, migrants carry<lb/> new ideas, practices and narratives which influence the social institutions and norms of their<lb/> origin countries. <ref type="biblio">Levitt (1998)</ref> records testimonies of Dominican Republic women who migrated<lb/> How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other?<lb/> DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> 14<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/></table>

			<p>to Boston and modified their ideas about gender roles in response to their more active<lb/> engagement in the workplace. They then transmitted these new norms to their home community<lb/> and non-migrant women used them to create new versions of womanhood. Women who migrate<lb/> tend to model their behaviour on women in destination countries, which proved to have positive<lb/> effects on reducing violence against women in Moldova for example, as women tolerate it less<lb/> from their partners (<ref type="biblio">Peleah, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Lastly, international migrants can alter the power structure within the household.<lb/> Migration can challenge traditional gender roles when the absence of one spouse leaves the other<lb/> one with both greater decision-making power and burden of responsibility and labour (<ref type="biblio">Jolly and<lb/> Reeves, 2005</ref>). In fact, in countries such as Mexico where men are far more likely migrating, left-<lb/>behind women often in-crease their decision-making power regarding daily-choices, since they<lb/> need to make decisions for the family while the head of the household is away (<ref type="biblio">Antman, 2011</ref>).<lb/> This new position of the woman in the household may translate in greater access to public and<lb/> political spaces, lowering overall discriminatory social institutions within the country. In<lb/> addition, larger women&apos;s bargaining power creates a virtuous circle, since women are more<lb/> likely to spend resources on daughters than fathers would (<ref type="biblio">Duflo, 2003</ref>). Similarly, another study<lb/> in Bangladesh finds that the emigration of men is positively associated with women&apos;s decision-<lb/>making capacity and the education of girls in migrant families (<ref type="biblio">Hadi, 2001</ref>). Moreover,<lb/> remittances have also been linked to increased female agency within family structures and a<lb/> change in perceptions of gender roles. Women who receive remittances have more and better<lb/> control of resources (<ref type="biblio">Jolly and Reeves, 2005</ref>). Economic remittances may also be used to give<lb/> women better access to health care, allow them to start their own business and keep girls in<lb/> education for longer (<ref type="biblio">Antman, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In sum, migration may impact discriminatory social institutions. Since this effect implies<lb/> a transfer of norms from host to sending country, the sign of the correlation is expected to differ<lb/> according to the discrimination levels in destination countries. According to these expected links,<lb/> male and female migration may have the same effect on gender inequality at home, with a higher<lb/> effect of female migration due to the first channel of transmission.<lb/></p>

Migration data<lb/> The United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social<lb/> Affairs (UNDESA) produces migration data which disaggregates international migrant stocks by<lb/> sex, origin and destination countries for the period 1990, 2000 and 2010.<lb/> 2 To better capture<lb/> gender dynamics in international migration, the change in migrant stocks observed between 2000<lb/> and 2010 is used as a measure for migration flows. More precisely, the net migration flows by sex<lb/> and country of origin in 2010 are used as dependent variable. To distinguish the effect of<lb/> discriminatory social institutions between female and male emigration, sub-samples are used.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Two main shortcomings of our migration data have to be acknowledged. Firstly, negative<lb/> migration flows are also computed. These declining stocks are due to the fact that migrants may<lb/> die, return to their home or even move to third countries. However, <ref type="biblio">Beine et al. (2011)</ref> confirm<lb/> that this approach still gives a reasonable approximation of the dynamics of migrant flows.<lb/></p>

In<lb/> addition, the SIGI is a more comprehensive measure considering other dimensions of gender<lb/> inequality in social institutions. It is a composite index which scores non-OECD countries on the<lb/> basis of 14 variables (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). 4 The scale of the SIGI goes from 0, meaning low discrimination to<lb/> 1, high level of discriminatory social institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY<lb/></head>

			<p>Three empirical strategies are used to assess the two-way relationship between<lb/> discriminatory social institutions and migration. While equation (1) models the influence of<lb/> discriminatory social institutions on female/male migration, equation (2) estimates the<lb/> transmission role of migration regarding gender inequality in social institutions. Finally, the<lb/> system (3) assesses the two-way relationship and simultaneous influence of gender inequality<lb/> and migration.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.1. Influence of discriminatory social institutions on migration<lb/> A migration gravity model augmented by gender inequality<lb/></head>

			<p>First, a standard migration gravity specification is used to estimate the influence of<lb/> discriminatory social institutions on female/male migration. The gravitational approach expects<lb/> migration to be negatively linked to distance and positively correlated with population of origin<lb/> and destination, income differential, language differential and contiguity (<ref type="biblio">Lewer and Van den<lb/> Berg, 2008; Clark et al., 2007; Beine et al., 2011; Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012</ref>). Indeed, migration is<lb/> driven by a cost-advantages trade-off. Each migrant chooses to migrate where the costs are the<lb/> lowest. Having lower distance between origin and destination countries, common language and<lb/> border reduces the migration costs and increases the probability to move. Migration is also<lb/> driven by the maximisation of utility, meaning that the opportunity differential between sending<lb/> and receiving countries matters.<lb/> It is necessary to acknowledge some criticisms that the gravity approach raises in both the<lb/> trade and migration literature. Anderson and van <ref type="biblio">Wincoop (2003)</ref> underline the lack of<lb/> theoretical foundations of gravitational models. In fact, the theory states that the more a country<lb/> is resistant to trade with all others, the more it is pushed to trade with a given bilateral partner<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Anderson, 1979</ref>). The main implication is that flows between two countries is determined by<lb/> relative trade barriers, otherwise said bilateral flows depend on the bilateral barrier between the<lb/> two countries relative to the average trade barriers that both face with the rest of the world.<lb/> According to the authors, the empirical literature does not consider this &quot; multilateral resistance &quot; .<lb/> As a consequence, empirical results may carry bias due to omitted variables, making impossible<lb/> the comparison of different situations. A similar approach has been recently applied by <ref type="biblio">Bertoli<lb/> and Fernandez-Huertas Moraga (2012)</ref> to migration, leading to the development of the notion of<lb/> &quot; multilateral resistance to migration &quot; . In fact, bilateral migration flows do not depend only on<lb/> the attractiveness of the destination country, but also on how this relates to the opportunities to<lb/> move to other destinations. Studying the determinants of bilateral migration flows to Spain<lb/></p>

			<p>, the authors find that ignoring the multilateral resistance to migration<lb/> biases the estimation. For example, the effect of GDP at origin is two thirds of that found when<lb/> multilateral resistance to migration is not accounted.<lb/> Despite the critics, the gravity equation proved to be one of the most stable relationship in<lb/> economics (<ref type="biblio">Chaney, 2013</ref>), and it is indeed useful in our empirical attempt of better understand<lb/> the linkages between gender inequality and female/male migration. Thus the basic gravity<lb/> framework is augmented by adding gender inequality in social institutions using the SIGI.<lb/> In addition to the standard determinants of migration (GDP per capita in origin country,<lb/> distance, contiguity, population of origin and destination countries, income and language<lb/> differentials), our main specification includes female (male) education. Having access to<lb/> education in the country of origin enhances the likelihood of migration (<ref type="biblio">González-Ferrer et al.,<lb/> 2013; Borjas, 1989</ref>) by reducing migration costs (<ref type="biblio">Dustmann, 2011</ref>). To take into account the key<lb/> role of working opportunities for women (men) in both origin and destination countries, female<lb/> (male) unemployment rates are added. Labour is one of the main reasons of migration (<ref type="biblio">Grieco<lb/> and Boyd, 1998</ref>). Hence, working opportunities in the destination country are an important<lb/> factor of migration. However, income differentials are not enough to understand the female<lb/> (male) situation in a given labour market and to capture the complex process of gendered<lb/> migration. Including unemployment rate by sex therefore controls for gender discrimination in<lb/> the workplace. Moreover, a measure of networks in the destination country is included to deal<lb/> with family reunification factors and diaspora effects. The role of peers is important since men<lb/> and women from the same country of origin tend to migrate to the same destination country.<lb/> This makes migration easier, as word-of-mouth communication helps to spread information<lb/> about countries of destination: the bigger the diaspora, the smaller the psychological and<lb/> integration cost of migration (<ref type="biblio">Munshi, 2003</ref>). Various measures of networks are used: the stock of<lb/> female (male) and total migrant in 2000. Finally, to control for family reunification, male (female)<lb/> emigration flows in 2010 are included.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of discriminatory social institutions on female and male migration,<lb/> respectively, is estimated using the following equation:</p>

			<figure>8<lb/> í µí± í µí±,í µí± = ∝ 0 +∝ 1 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 2 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 3 í µí² í µí±,í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± (1)<lb/></figure>

			<p>where mi,j is the log of net female (male) migration flows between origin country i and<lb/> destination country j, SIGI is the log of the Social Institutions and Gender Index,</p>

			<figure>9 xi,j the control<lb/> variables and εi,j the error term. Control variables include GDP per capita in origin country,<lb/> 8<lb/> All variables are expressed in logarithm<lb/> 9<lb/> It is worthy to note than instead of using the log of the SIGI differential between the origin and the<lb/> destination countries, the paper includes the two separately. This allows us to interpret the effect of<lb/> social institutions in the origin country for a given level of discrimination in the destination one, and<lb/> vice-versa. However, it does not exclude the interpretation of the differential since ln (<lb/> í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí±<lb/> í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí±<lb/></figure>

			<p>As a second step to understand which dimension of discriminatory social institutions is<lb/> driving the results, equation (1) is estimated using each sub-index of the SIGI instead of the<lb/> overall SIGI. This allows us to explore which dimensions have the greatest impact on female<lb/> emigration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Empirical issues<lb/></head>

			<p>Nevertheless, two econometric challenges arise in estimating equation (1). First, bilateral<lb/> migration data present a high occurrence of zero values, which may bias our estimations.<lb/> Second, our gender inequality variable may be correlated with the error term, due to potential<lb/> reverse causality, since gender inequality may be a determinant of international migration but at<lb/> the same time migrants may shift gender attitudes in their origin countries. In addition,<lb/> unobservable characteristics can affect both SIGI and female migration flows, leading to biased<lb/> estimates. In order to address these econometric issues, the paper initially abstracts from the bias<lb/> induced by the log linearization of gravity models, 10 using OLS. It then introduces a Heckman<lb/> two-step procedure in order to account for the high occurrence of null migration flows. Finally,<lb/> an instrumental variable approach is taken to address the potential endogeneity.<lb/></p>

			<head>The high occurrence of null migration flows<lb/></head>

			<p>It is worthy indicating that migration is very unlikely to occur among all country pairs.<lb/> Therefore, our sample is characterised by a high occurrence of zero (approximately 75% of our<lb/> South-South female sample). 11 This incidence of zero requires the use of a particular estimation<lb/> strategy. While standard gravity models estimate a log-specification using OLS, this approach is<lb/> limited since it forces to either exclude null migration flows from the estimates or to transform<lb/> them by taking the log of the migration flows plus 1. Moreover, Santos-Silva and <ref type="biblio">Tenreyro (2006)<lb/></ref> show the inconsistency of OLS estimates if the variance of the error term í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± depends on the<lb/> covariates in equation (1).<lb/> An alternative to generate consistent estimates even in cases of over-dispersion is the use<lb/> of a Poisson regression model that relies on pseudo maximum likelihood estimates. However,<lb/> the Poisson solution is nevertheless unfeasible for the selection analysis, while Baudassé and<lb/> Bazillier (2012) provide evidence regarding the key role of gender inequality in the selection<lb/> process of migrants. As previously noted, the authors assume two theoretical hypotheses with<lb/> respect to the linkages between emigration and gender inequality. First, they consider gender<lb/> 10<lb/></p>

			<p>More precisely, the paper focuses on positive flows (96% of our observations) and adds 1 before to take<lb/> their log.<lb/></p>

			<figure>11<lb/> Our sample contains 96 developing countries. Hence, 9 120 female emigration flows are observed but<lb/> only 2 280 are positive.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326<lb/> DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/> 21<lb/></figure>

			<p>inequality as a push factor for female emigration. Second, they assume that gender inequality<lb/> leads to a gender bias in a selection of migrants. Estimating by a Heckman two-step procedure,<lb/> their results validate the second hypotheses rather than the first one.<lb/> Following <ref type="biblio">Beine et al. (2011)</ref> and Baudassé and Bazillier (2012), a Heckman two-step<lb/> procedure is used. This technique has the advantages to explicitly account for a potential<lb/> selection bias and to generate consistent estimates even in cases of high zero occurrence. 12<lb/> Commonly used in presence of potential selection bias, the Heckman technique involves two<lb/> steps: the first step assesses the probability of observing female (male) migrants between two<lb/> given countries using a Probit estimator and an exclusion variable, while the second step<lb/> quantifies the size of those migrating. Following <ref type="biblio">Beine et al. (2011)</ref> and Baudassé and Bazillier<lb/> (2012), diplomatic representation is used as exclusion variable in the selection equation. In fact,<lb/> having a diplomatic exchange with a foreign country may reduce migration costs linked to the<lb/> initial issuing of visas, increasing the probability to have positive emigration flows, but not the<lb/> size of these emigration flows.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reverse causality and unobservable characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>A typical puzzle of migration studies is due to endogeneity problems. For instance, in<lb/> presence of reverse causality, estimations could be biased, since gender inequality in social<lb/> institutions may be a determinant of female (male) migration, but conversely female (male)<lb/> migration flows may also affect gender inequality in origin countries, due to a stream of new<lb/> social norms, a change in the household bargaining power, and so forth. Similarly, results could<lb/> be biased by the presence of omitted variables and especially unobservable country<lb/> characteristics that affect both the probability of having female emigrants and the level of<lb/> discriminatory social institutions in a country. These endogeneity issues result in biased OLS<lb/> estimates, since covariates are correlated with the error termí µí¼ í µí±,í µí± .<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to allow consistent estimation, an instrumental variable approach is applied. A<lb/> good instrument may still lead to consistent parameter estimates. In order to be valid,<lb/> instruments must be uncorrelated with the error term in the explanatory equation and have no<lb/> direct effect on female (male) migration. To be relevant, the instrument must be correlated with<lb/> the endogenous independent variables, that is the SIGI. Previous studies on gender inequality<lb/> rarely shed light on the possibility of endogeneity issues and the validity of the instruments to<lb/> solve them. A prominent exception is represented by <ref type="biblio">Dollar and Gatti (1999)</ref>, who instrument<lb/> gender inequality in a growth equation by religious affiliation and civil liberties. However, some<lb/> doubts have been raised by the literature regarding the exogeneity of religion and civil liberties.<lb/> Following <ref type="biblio">Ferrant (2015)</ref>, the CEDAW ratification date is used as instrumental variable<lb/> for discriminatory social institutions and controls for religiosity and civil liberties are added.<lb/> Indeed, the CEDAW ratification date can be considered as a public commitment and recognition<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, Beine and Docquier (2009) claim that the two estimation strategies, that is Heckman and<lb/> Poisson, provide similar results and are equivalent.<lb/></p>

			<p>of gender equality as a human right. Ratification implies recognition of the legitimacy of<lb/> reducing gender inequality. It leads to changes in government behaviour toward gender<lb/> inequality in social institutions and, for example, to changes in law regarding women and<lb/> discrimination, to implementation of incentives in order to promote law enforcement or<lb/> punishments. CEDAW can be a powerful tool for change when legislative and other measures to<lb/> protect women&apos;s rights are undertaken once states ratify CEDAW. For example, Bangladesh now<lb/> prohibits sexual harassment, thanks to a milestone decision issued in 2009 by the High Court.<lb/> Thanks to a training manual titled &quot; CEDAW Made Easy &quot; , empowering traditional leaders in<lb/> Cameroon to use the Convention to bring about concrete improvements in the lives of women in<lb/> their communities, they are changing traditional practices that are harmful to women. The<lb/> CEDAW denounced the prevalence of early marriage in several countries, some of which have<lb/> thus changed their legal age of marriage, which in turn has reduced the prevalence of such<lb/> practices: the average prevalence of early marriage across developing countries has decreased<lb/> from 21% in 2009 to 17% in 2012 (<ref type="biblio">Cerise et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> Good instruments often come from policy changes and an earlier date of ratification can<lb/> be assumed to be linked with a greater and deeper attention to gender equality within a country.<lb/> This paper considers the CEDAW ratification date as good predictor of the level of<lb/> discriminatory social institutions. However, it assumes that this date has no effect on female<lb/> (male) migration. Then, the exogeneity of female (male) migration flows per capita is rejected by<lb/> the Wu-Hausman test at the 5% level. 13 Finally, the validity (i.e. Cov(CEDAW, í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± ) = 0) and the<lb/> relevance (i.e. Cov(CEDAW, SIGI) ≠ 0) of this instrument are tested. This instrument is<lb/> significantly correlated with the endogenous variable, as indicated by the first step of the IV<lb/> estimations (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Moreover, simple estimation of the SIGI including additional controls and<lb/> instruments result in a relatively high partial R. Finally, the paper checks that instrumental<lb/> regressions are not null with F-statistic higher than 0.10, suggested by the rule of thumb (<ref type="biblio">Stock<lb/> and Yogo, 2002</ref>). Even if the exogeneity of the instrument is hard to test, performing female<lb/> (male) emigration regressions do not provide evidence of correlation between error term and the<lb/> instrument. Indeed, the null hypothesis that the CEDAW coefficient is equal to zero when the<lb/> residuals are regressed is not rejected.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.2. Influence of migration on gender inequality in social institutions<lb/></head>

			<p>In this second model, the effect of migration on gender inequality in opportunities is<lb/> estimated. The paper assumes that migration is a channel of idea transmission and may impact<lb/> the level of gender inequality in social institutions in origin countries. While migration flows<lb/> could capture size effect, the share of migrants in total population is used to measure migrants&apos;<lb/> influence on discriminatory social norms, excluding population size effects. Whatever the<lb/> direction of this influence, larger shares of migrants are correlated with greater probabilities to<lb/> transmit new ideas.<lb/></p>

			<head>13<lb/></head>

			<p>The Durbin-Wu-Hausman score has a p.value of 0.028 and 0.023 for women and men, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<figure>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326<lb/> DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/> 23<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, using shares allows taking into account only the weight of migrants in a given<lb/> country. Unfortunately, the &quot; quality &quot; of migrants is not captured. Yet, according to his/her social<lb/> position, a migrant could affect differently social norms. For example, it would be expected that a<lb/> male tribal chief would have higher impact on social institutions, due to his leadership, implying<lb/> higher potential transmission power. This assumption is consistent with our previous example in<lb/> Cameroon, where traditional leaders are an agent of change regarding gender equality. Rather<lb/> than distinguishing social position, female and male migrants are distinguished. According to<lb/> the theoretical links, the female migration effect is expected to be higher. Finally, the paper<lb/> divides migrant shares by level of discriminatory social institutions in destination countries. In<lb/> fact migrants learn those social norms in place at destination, leading to heterogeneous effects<lb/> according to the area where the migrant moves.</p>

			<figure>For instance, Beine et al. (2013) demonstrate that<lb/> returnee migrants are more likely to have fewer children than non-migrant households if they<lb/> migrated towards lower-fertility destinations, whilst Bertoli and Marchetta (2013) find opposite<lb/> results when looking at returnees from Egypt who have worked in high-fertility Arab countries.<lb/> The following equation is then estimated, where the SIGI in origin countries is the<lb/> dependent variable:<lb/> í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± = í µí»½ 0 + í µí»½ 1 í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ + í µí»½ 2 í µí² í µí± + í µí¼ í µí± (2)<lb/> The interest variable í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ is alternatively the share of total, female and male migrants in<lb/> the total population in 2010. The set of additional controls í µí² í µí± includes GDP per capita (in log),<lb/> share of population self-declared as religious practising, CEDAW date of ratification, female<lb/> education and level of civil liberties. Finally í µí¼ í µí± is the error term.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The inclusion of these controls is justified by the gender literature. The income growth is<lb/> expected to reduce gender inequality by loosening constraints, improving market opportunities,<lb/> promoting market mechanisms, increasing household available resources and so on (See <ref type="biblio">Dollar<lb/> and Gatti, 1999; Forsythe et al., 2000; World Bank, 2012; Ferrant, 2013</ref> among others). Religious<lb/> affiliation and civil liberties are included following Dollar and Gatti (1999). They show that, to a<lb/> large extent, gender inequality can be explained by religious preference and underlying<lb/> characteristics of societies, such as the extent of civil liberties. The self-declared religious practice<lb/> is used here, without distinguishing religion. The paper assumes that higher share of population<lb/> declared as practising a religion higher traditional gender roles are enforced leading to higher<lb/> discriminatory social institutions, whatever the religion concerned. On the other hand, high<lb/> restriction on civil liberties is correlated with high discrimination on women. Moreover, as<lb/> previously mentioned, an earlier ratification of the CEDAW is expected to be positively<lb/> correlated with gender equality. Finally, greater access to education constitutes a way to move<lb/> away from gender discrimination.<lb/></p>

			<p>As shown in the previous model, gender inequality in origin countries is a factor<lb/> explaining female migration flows. Hence, looking at the effect of migration on gender inequality<lb/> raises endogeneity issues. In addition, omitted variables could have an impact on both the<lb/> dependent and the interest variables. For example, a development programme implemented by<lb/> an international organisation in order to develop female employment would reduce both gender<lb/></p>

			<head>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other?<lb/></head>

			<p>inequality and female migration. Firstly, higher job opportunities for women lead to lower<lb/> gender gaps in education. Secondly, if women have more job opportunities at home, they have<lb/> less incentive to migrate for labour reasons. To tackle endogeneity issues, the paper follows<lb/> McKenzie and Rapoport (2011) by instrumenting the migrant share in 2010 with historical<lb/> migration flows (specifically, migrant share in 2000). 14 While previous migration flows could<lb/> affect current ones through network effects or persistence of incentives to migrate, it has no effect<lb/> on the level of current discriminatory norms, except through the current migration share or the<lb/> previous levels of discrimination in the SIGI. The instrumental strategy assumes that the<lb/> instrument is valid (i.e. Cov(Mi,t−1, í µí¼ í µí± ) = 0) and relevant (i.e. <ref type="biblio">Cov(Mi,t−1, Mi,t</ref>) ≠ 0). This instrument is<lb/> significantly correlated with the endogenous variable, as indicated by the first step of the IV<lb/> estimations and F-statistics are higher than 0.10 (Tables (6) and (8)). The exogeneity is rejected for<lb/> all dependent variables at 5%.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.3. The two-way relationship between gender inequality and migration<lb/></head>

			<p>In a last step, feedback is tested. The paper assesses the two-way relationship between<lb/> migration and gender inequality by dealing with the simultaneous determination of gendered<lb/> migration flows and level of discriminatory social institutions. Econometrically, this simultaneity<lb/> issue implies correlation between error terms εi,j and µi that could be taken into account using a<lb/> 3SLS estimator.</p>

			<figure>The system (3) includes equations (1) and (2), where all model parameters are<lb/> jointly estimated.<lb/> {<lb/> í µí± í µí±,í µí± = ∝ 0 +∝ 1 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 2 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 3 í µí² í µí±,í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±,í µí±<lb/> í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± = í µí»½ 0 + í µí»½ 1 í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ + í µí»½ 2 í µí² í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±<lb/> (3)<lb/> 14<lb/></figure>

			<p>More precisely, an IV and IV-probit estimation are performed, in order to assess the probability to have<lb/> positive female / male flows between two given countries, controlling for potential endogeneities. The<lb/> use of an IV-probit model is preferred, both because it solves the problem of the high occurrence of<lb/> zeros, and because it is coherent with the Heckman results.<lb/></p>

Tables 2 and 3 present the estimated effect of<lb/> SIGI in both origin and destination countries on female migration flows. The OLS estimates are<lb/> provided in Table 2 column (1), Table 2 columns (2) and (3) report the estimates using the two-<lb/>step Heckman approach and Table 3 those using instrumental variable.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In most of our specifications, control variables are significant and with the expected sign.<lb/> Income differential results positive, representing the economic attractiveness of the foreign<lb/> economy. Populations in both origin and destination countries have positive signs, in accordance<lb/> with the gravitational forces of demographic pressure. Conversely, the distance between the two<lb/> countries is negatively correlated with migration flows, due to increasing migration costs. Both<lb/> geographical (i.e. contiguity) and cultural (i.e. common language) proximity have the expected<lb/> positive sign, since migrants tend to move in countries that are closer to their homes and where<lb/> they can easily communicate. Women&apos;s years of education has a significant effect confirming that<lb/> being educated increases the probability to migrate.<lb/> 15 Unemployment rates in origin and<lb/> destination countries are statistically significant suggesting that differentials in job opportunities<lb/> matters. 16 It is worthy to note the significance of the exclusion variable in the Heckman<lb/> procedure, namely diplomatic exchange. The positive sign indicates that the presence of a<lb/> diplomatic representation in a foreign country is often seen as prerequisite for engaging in legal<lb/> cross-border migration: the probability of having female migrants increases by 26% in presence<lb/> of diplomatic exchange. Male migration flows in 2010 are positively correlated with female<lb/> flows. The interpretation is twofold. First, this can be related to family reunification and<lb/> dependent migration: women and men migrate from the same country towards the same<lb/> destination in the same decade due to family relationship. Second,</p>

			<p>The impact of the discriminatory social institutions in both origin and destination<lb/> countries on female migration is significant and negative in all specifications. It suggests that<lb/> higher discrimination is related to lower female emigration. Gender inequality appears to be<lb/> both a pull and a push factor for migrant women.

			<figure>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326<lb/> DEV/DOC(2015)1<lb/> © OECD 2015<lb/> 27<lb/> home reduces female emigration, since women&apos;s restricted opportunities and low decision-<lb/>power limit their possibility to move abroad. On the other hand, lower discrimination in the<lb/> destination country attracts female immigration.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Interestingly, using a Heckman two-step procedure gives more details on this<lb/> relationship. 17 In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, estimated effects of discriminatory social institutions on the probability<lb/> to have female migration flows between two countries (column (3)) and the magnitude of these<lb/> flows (column (2)) are presented. While the levels of SIGI in origin and destination countries<lb/> have no significant impact on the extent of female migration flows, they exhibit negative and<lb/> significant coefficients in the selection equation.

			<p>Finally, several checks are performed in order to test the robustness of our findings<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). First, migration networks are included in the specification (row (2)) since it reduces the<lb/> cost of migration. Then, the differential in government expenditure is added to take into account<lb/> the effect of social allowance and public services provision on migration (row (3)). Finally, a<lb/> conflict variable in origin countries (row (4)) and the level of civil liberties at home (row (5)) are<lb/> included to control for the effect of political situation on migration dynamics (<ref type="biblio">Péridy, 2010</ref>). In all<lb/> these cases, even including all these variables, the results maintain their statistical significance.<lb/> Regarding male migration, the impact of gender inequality in social institutions is not<lb/> significant whatever the estimators used (<ref type="biblio">Table A.3 in Appendix)</ref>. It suggests that male<lb/> migration is not sensitive to the level of discrimination in the origin countries, neither in the<lb/> destination. The interpretation is twofold: i) men&apos;s decision to migrate is not related to the level<lb/> of gender discrimination in social institutions; or ii) the SIGI is not able to capture social pressure<lb/> on male behaviour and choices. This finding highlights that male and female incentives to<lb/> migrate differ, suggesting gender-sensitive migration factors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Further analysis disaggregates the SIGI in the origin countries into its five sub-indices, in<lb/> order to identify which one drives the results (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). 18 Discrimination within the family and<lb/> restricted civil liberties at home appear to be the main drivers of the gender inequality-migration<lb/> nexus. In particular, while discriminatory family code confirms our previous results on the<lb/> negative relationship between gender inequality and female migration in the selection equation,<lb/> restricted civil liberties exhibit a positive effect. This may be explained by lower access to the<lb/> public sphere encouraging women to escape elsewhere to enjoy more civil liberties.

			<p>and limit even their ability to move. It is worthy to note that both sub-indices have a significant<lb/> and negative effect on the extent of female migration, meaning that high levels of discriminatory<lb/> social norms in the family and in the public space reduce not only the probability to have female<lb/> migration but also the size of those women who get to migrate.<lb/></p>

			<head>VI. CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Migration is a complex field of research that requires greater attention to the particular<lb/> gender dynamics of social institutions. This paper assesses the two-way linkages between<lb/> gendered migration and discriminatory social norms, leading to relevant findings on the<lb/> interaction between social institutions, gender and South-South migration.<lb/></p>

			<p>On one side, estimates show that discrimination against women in social institutions in<lb/> both origin and destination countries plays a key role in the selection process of migrants. While<lb/> gender inequality in social norms constrains female emigration, it has no effect on male<lb/> emigration, suggesting that men and women&apos;s incentives to migrate differ. Hence, although the<lb/> broader structural causes of emigration appear to be gender-neutral, the role of gender inequality<lb/> in social institutions is not. In addition to standard determinants, discriminatory social<lb/> institutions influence female migration patterns. This is critical in order to understand the role of<lb/> social institutions in female decision-making. By limiting their access to opportunities, resources<lb/> and power, discriminatory social institutions restrict women&apos;s capabilities to achieve their<lb/> migration wishes. In particular, discrimination within the family and restricted civil liberties<lb/> drive our findings.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other side, migrants are agent of change by influencing gender relations. In<lb/> particular, migration may either entrench gender inequality in social institutions or challenge<lb/> them, according to the level of discriminatory social institutions in the host country. While larger<lb/> shares of migrants towards low or moderate discriminatory countries are linked to greater<lb/> gender equality in social institutions in home communities, migration towards high<lb/> discriminatory destinations has the reverse impact. Both men and women are agent of change,<lb/> although the effect of female migrants is significantly higher.<lb/> Interconnecting the two directions of the relationship emphasises the existence of a<lb/> circular pattern: high gender inequality in social institutions at origin constraints female<lb/> migration, but at the same time the share of female migrants is too low to positively shift<lb/> discriminatory norms towards greater gender equality.<lb/> However, drawbacks limited our research. In particular, sex-disaggregated data on<lb/> international migration is still scarce and seldom collected, with short time coverage. Similarly,<lb/> gender inequality in social institutions has started to be measured only recently, not allowing for<lb/> a panel data analysis: the SIGI is only available for one year limiting our empirical study to a<lb/> cross-country analysis. Although these results are robust to specifications changes and controls<lb/> for potential endogeneities and simultaneities, the interpretation of this data-driven analysis<lb/></p>

			<p>should be cautious concerning its causality. Since it is not possible to control for year and country<lb/> specific effects, findings may be partly due to omitted variables. Finally, at the micro level, more<lb/> research is required in order to collect data on immigrants and return migrants to allow for an<lb/> estimation of the spillovers on family structures in origin countries. Nevertheless, this paper is a<lb/> first contribution to the literature highlighting the bidirectional nature of the migration-gender<lb/> nexus and the importance of discriminatory social institutions.<lb/></p>
