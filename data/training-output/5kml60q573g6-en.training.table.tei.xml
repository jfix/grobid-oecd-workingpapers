            <figDesc>In Malta, reports published by the Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) set out priorities<lb/> of the subsequent years. For example, the Enforcement Complaints and Compliance Section<lb/> (ECCS) 155 prioritises removing large quantities of signs and billboards that were placed without<lb/> permission and were unsightly. Priority was also given to cleaning up or removing scrap yards,<lb/> and hundreds of tons of rubble and scrap material were deposited in facilities for recycling.<lb/> </figDesc>
<lb/> 
            <table>In Poland, for example, the Chief Inspector for Environmental Protection publishes an annual<lb/> report entitled &apos;General Directions in Activities of Environmental Protection Inspection&apos;. The report<lb/> sets out priorities for enforcement activities, e.g., inspections on types of business activities or<lb/> different types of legislation to be prioritised for inspections. On the basis of this report, each<lb/> Voivodship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection prepares a detailed annual enforcement<lb/> plan. Similar information is available (but is unpublished) in Slovenia and the Inspectorate for<lb/> Environment and Spatial Planning has an annual plan prioritising areas for targeted surveillance<lb/> and enforcement of particular legislation.<lb/> Are policies in place for enforcement of, and compliance with, environmental legislation<lb/> and are intellectual property rights adequately funded and resourced?<lb/> All NMS indicated difficulties with having enough resources to deal with all contraventions.<lb/> Particular difficulties were reported in Cyprus and Slovenia. In the former, officials in the Ministry<lb/> of the Environment indicated that substantial energies and resources had been put into<lb/> incorporating the acquis communautaire into Cyprus law, leaving little human or financial<lb/> resources for inspections and enforcement 156 .</table>

            <table>157<lb/> See annual report for Malta Environment and Planning Report and Accounts 2005 p. 36 [www.mepa.org.mt]. which includes a priority Watch List. There is a second list the Watch List of countries that do not<lb/> provide an adequate level of IPR protection or enforcement, or market access for persons relying<lb/> on intellectual property protection 158 . The Slovak Republic was dropped from this list in 2005.<lb/> However, some NMS remain on the list. Hungary remained on the Watch List for 2006, despite<lb/> the recognition by the U.S. authorities of the recent enactment of intellectual property<lb/> enforcement legislation. There has undoubtedly been progress in this field in Hungary in recent<lb/> years. Hungary was moved from Priority Watch List to Watch List in 2003. Positive steps have<lb/> been taken in Hungary to modernise its copyright code, but poor enforcement of these laws,<lb/> delays in bringing prosecutions, low fines, weak sentences and weak border enforcement remain<lb/> a source of concern acknowledged by the authorities in Hungary.<lb/> Latvia also remained on the Watch List for 2006, despite the fact that it has improved<lb/> enforcement, among other things, by improving co-ordination between ministries and<lb/> enforcement authorities. There has been an increase in prosecutions, but low fines and prison<lb/> sentences are not acting as a sufficient deterrent to prevent infringements. Border controls<lb/> remain weak and internet piracy remains a problem.<lb/> Lithuania also remains on the list for 2006. It has improved its legislative framework for<lb/> protecting IPR and in combating software piracy. However, optical media piracy levels remain<lb/> high.<lb/> Poland also faces challenges from increasing software piracy. It remains on the Watch List for<lb/> 2006. There were an increased number of raids in 2005 to seize pirated software but the<lb/> imposition by the courts of low fines and short prison sentences appears not to have created a<lb/> sufficient disincentive to continued infringements.</table>
