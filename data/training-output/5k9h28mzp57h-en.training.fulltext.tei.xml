			<figure>Fiscal consolidation<lb/> Part 5. What factors determine the success of consolidation efforts?<lb/></figure>

			<p>The global economic and financial crisis exacerbated the need for fiscal consolidation in many OECD<lb/> countries. Drawing lessons from past episodes of fiscal consolidation, this paper investigates the economic<lb/> environments, political settings and policy measures conducive to fiscal consolidation and debt stabilisation<lb/> using probit, duration, truncated regression and bivariate Heckman selection methods. The empirical analysis<lb/> builds on the earlier literature and extends it to include new aspects that may be of importance for consolidating<lb/> governments. The empirical analysis confirms previous findings that the presence of fiscal rules – expenditure<lb/> or budget balance rules – is associated with a greater probability of stabilising debt. Crucial in determining the<lb/> causal link behind the association, the results also reveal an independent role for such rules over and above the<lb/> impact of preferences for fiscal prudence. Also, while the analysis confirms that spending-driven adjustments<lb/> vis-à-vis revenue-driven ones are more likely to stabilise debt, it also reveals that large consolidations need<lb/> multiple instruments for consolidation to succeed. Sub-national governments, in particular state-level<lb/> governments can contribute to the success of central government consolidation, if they co-operate. To ensure<lb/> that state-level governments do co-operate, having the right regulatory framework with the extension of fiscal<lb/> rules to sub-central government levels is important.<lb/></p>

			<head>Introduction and main results<lb/></head>

			<p>In the aftermath of the economic and financial crisis many OECD countries face substantial fiscal<lb/> consolidation needs. In this context, taking stock of past consolidation episodes can provide insights into<lb/> what policy and institutional measures were most conducive to successful consolidations. The analysis of<lb/> past consolidation episodes between 1960-2009 builds on and extends earlier OECD work by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Ahrend et al. (2006) and Guichard et al. (2007)</ref>. It uses probit, duration, truncated regression and bivariate<lb/> Heckman selection methods to investigate consolidations, highlighting the different ingredients that affect<lb/> how much consolidation is undertaken and whether it is successful in terms of stabilising debt. The<lb/> estimations consider five aspects of fiscal consolidations:<lb/>  What conditions make governments start fiscal adjustments?<lb/>  What determines how long adjustments last?<lb/>  What determines the size?<lb/>  What determines the intensity (the annual average consolidation over the consolidation episode)<lb/> of the adjustment?<lb/></p>

			<p> What makes fiscal retrenchments successful in the sense of stabilising the debt/GDP ratio?<lb/></p>

			<p>The definition of a consolidation episode is crucial as different thresholds and budget data may lead to<lb/> different findings. Accordingly, to obtain robust results, five thresholds are used. These thresholds cover<lb/> several types of consolidation episodes from very small ones defined as any improvement in the budget<lb/> balance that may occur over a number of years to very large ones of at least 2 percentage points of GDP in<lb/> a given year. Three definitions for the success of consolidation are used: debt stabilises i) the year after,<lb/> ii) two years after and iii) three years after the episode ends. Different definitions of the budget balance<lb/> were used in the analysis, though only results for the cyclically-adjusted underlying primary balance are<lb/> reported</p>

			<table>.<lb/> 1.<lb/> At the time of writing the author was a member of the Economics Department of the OECD. This is a<lb/> background paper for the OECD &quot; s project on Fiscal Consolidation (see Sutherland et al., 2012 for the main<lb/> paper). This paper is a revised version of a document prepared for a meeting of Working Party No. 1 of the<lb/> OECD Economic Policy Committee held in October 2011. The author is indebted to the participants of the<lb/> meeting as well as Hansjörg Blöchliger, Peter Hoeller and Douglas Sutherland for useful comments and<lb/> suggestions and to Susan Gascard for excellent editorial support.<lb/></table>

			<p>The analysis considers the role of fiscal rules in consolidations. Dummy variables indicate whether<lb/> i) expenditure rules, ii) budget balance rules or iii) the combination of expenditure and budget balance<lb/> rules are in place and iv) an indicator capturing the strength of fiscal rules, which is only available for the<lb/> EU countries, is tested. Although the direction of causality between fiscal discipline and fiscal rules is<lb/> difficult to establish in a cross-country analysis, findings in the literature based on Canadian, Swiss and US<lb/> data tend to support a role for fiscal rules in underpinning prudent fiscal behaviour even when voters &quot;<lb/> preferences (based on observed preferences from micro-level data) are taken into account. 2 As fiscal<lb/> consolidation itself affects many of the economic environment factors that are included in the analysis,<lb/> such variables were entered with a lag to reduce the simultaneity problem.<lb/> The main findings, summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, are the following:<lb/>  Fiscal rules are, in general, associated with fiscal consolidation episodes that are successful in<lb/> stabilising debt, though there is no evidence that they influence the size or the intensity of<lb/> consolidation. Budget balance rules appear to lengthen the duration of consolidations.<lb/></p>

			<p> The composition of consolidation measures seems to be related to its success. Expenditure based<lb/> consolidations appear to be more effective in stabilising debt. However, the specific<lb/> consolidation measures that lead to success seem to differ by the type of consolidation (i.e. small<lb/> or large, gradual or &quot; cold turkey &quot; ) and by the horizon of debt stabilisation (i.e. debt stabilises one,<lb/> two or three years after the consolidation episode ends). Very large consolidations tend to be<lb/> achieved by multiple instruments, including both revenue and spending items.<lb/></p>

			<p> Strong growth appears to matter for stabilising debt, though less for the size or intensity of<lb/> consolidations. Low growth rates may lead to protracted consolidation episodes.<lb/></p>

			<p> Declining interest rates seem to increase the probability of success and the duration of<lb/> consolidation, though have no robust impact on the start, size or intensity of the consolidation.<lb/></p>

			<p> The political setting 3 also appears to matter for the success of consolidation: non-centrist<lb/> governments are less likely to stabilise debt than those closer to the centre. The orientation of<lb/> government does not seem to affect the duration of consolidation. In some specifications, strong<lb/> governments further from the centre tend to engage in smaller and less intensive consolidation.<lb/></p>

			<p> Newly-elected governments seem to be more likely to start a fiscal adjustment programme and<lb/> have a positive effect on duration.<lb/></p>

			<p> Consolidations by state-level governments tend to increase the probability of success of central<lb/> government retrenchment efforts, but this is not the case for consolidations at the local<lb/> government level (not reported in</p>

			<table>Table 1).<lb/> The rest of this paper is structured as follows: The next section summarises the main findings from the<lb/> empirical literature. This is followed by a short discussion of the tools used and the main definitions of<lb/> consolidation episodes and whether they succeed in stabilising debt. The following section presents<lb/> 2.<lb/> Krogstrup and Wälti (2008) and Dafflon and Pujol (2001) are examples of the literature finding a causality<lb/> between fiscal rules and fiscal discipline.<lb/></table>

			<p>3.<lb/> In the analyses two variables capturing the political orientation and the stability of government are used as<lb/> in <ref type="biblio">Égert (2010)</ref>: the strength of right-leaning and left-leaning governments. The value is higher the further<lb/> left or right the government &quot; s political stance (i.e. very left wing or very conservative) of the political<lb/> spectrum and the stronger its political standing is (the strongest is a single party majority government).<lb/> detailed results for the econometric analysis of different aspects of consolidation. The final section<lb/> concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for fiscal consolidation.<lb/></p>

The fiscal rule variables in the success<lb/> equations are entered sequentially.<lb/> The methods used are: probit for the start and duration of the consolidation, truncated regression for the analysis of the size and<lb/> intensity of the consolidation and the bivariate Heckman selection model for the success of a consolidation in stabilising debt.<lb/></p>

			<head>A review of the literature<lb/></head>

			<p>The literature on fiscal consolidation episodes has identified major determinants of the likelihood of<lb/> starting fiscal consolidation and its success, as well as several other attributes. The major questions of<lb/> interest addressed by the fiscal consolidation episode literature are i) in which circumstances are fiscal<lb/> adjustments likely to start and ii) in which circumstances are they successful. For the start of<lb/> consolidations, initial conditions including the macroeconomic environment and political economy settings<lb/> appear to be decisive. For the likelihood of success, a broader set of conditions have been tested. Not<lb/> surprisingly, given that the channels through which policy effects come through may differ across<lb/> episodes, the literature is inconclusive on some of the policies. A large part of the literature focuses on the<lb/> composition of consolidation, primarily whether it should be based on expenditure cuts or revenue<lb/> increases. While there seems to be consensus on the larger role for expenditure cuts, the results are less<lb/> homogenous at the more disaggregated level. Tackling politically sensitive budgetary items, however,<lb/> seems to be a crucial ingredient of successful consolidations. Fewer studies deal with the role of the policy<lb/> mix or structural and institutional conditions in determining the success of consolidation. Moreover, the<lb/> applicability of past consolidation experiences may be limited as policymakers now face additional<lb/> challenges such as repairing banking sectors and coping with weak global demand. The present<lb/> consolidation may also be distinct owing to its required size and how wide-spread consolidation needs are.<lb/> These features may imply the need for a broader set of policy tools to achieve consolidation.<lb/> Fiscal consolidation is more likely to be launched when fiscal conditions are weak and the domestic<lb/> economy is doing well relative to other economies (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Weak public finance conditions are found to<lb/> be an important trigger of consolidation (<ref type="biblio">Barrios et al., 2010, Guichard et al., 2007</ref>, European<lb/> Commission, 2007 and Von <ref type="biblio">Hagen and Strauch, 2001</ref>). In contrast to the intuition that fiscal actions only<lb/> take place when the authorities are forced by circumstances to embark on a consolidation path, von Hagen<lb/> and Strauch (2001) and the European Commission (2007) found that positive output gaps increase the<lb/> probability of launching a retrenchment. 4 Von Hagen and Strauch (2001) also found a negative impact for<lb/> the international environment, which, combined with the positive coefficient on domestic cyclical<lb/> conditions, imply that governments are more likely to undertake consolidation efforts when the domestic<lb/> economy is doing well relative to other economies. Von Hagen and Strauch (2001) also found evidence of<lb/> peer pressure: an increase in the OECD structural government balance has a strong positive effect on the<lb/> likelihood to start a consolidation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The duration of fiscal consolidations is affected by the composition of the adjustment, initial<lb/> conditions and consolidation fatigue. Von <ref type="biblio">Hagen et al. (2002)</ref> found that when output was below potential<lb/> but improving, a tightening fiscal stance in other countries and an increasing contribution by spending, in<lb/> particular transfers and wage expenditures, to the total consolidation increase the likelihood that the<lb/> consolidation episode will continue. <ref type="biblio">Guichard et al. (2007) and Ahrend et al. (2006)</ref> confirmed the<lb/> importance of a negative output gap to continuing an adjustment programme. On the other hand,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Tsibouris et al. (2006)</ref> found no significant effect. Von <ref type="biblio">Hagen et al. (2002)</ref> also found evidence of<lb/> consolidation fatigue by showing that the longer an episode lasts, ceteris paribus, the greater the likelihood<lb/> that the adjustment process will be reversed. This finding was confirmed by <ref type="biblio">Guichard et al. (2007)</ref> and<lb/> Ahrend et al.</p>

				<formula>(2006).<lb/></formula>

			<p>In general, gradual consolidations tend to be more successful than a cold shower adjustment, but at<lb/> high and sharply rising debt levels and in a low-growth environment a cold shower may be more effective<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Barrios et al., 2010; European Commission, 2007</ref>). A gradual retrenchment, however, is not successful in<lb/> the case of consolidations following sharp debt increases. Moreover, <ref type="biblio">Barrios et al. (2010)</ref> found that<lb/> monetary and economic conditions may be playing a role in determining the consolidation strategy. Cold<lb/> showers may be the right choice if initial debt levels and interest rates are high and GDP growth low, while<lb/> the opposite conditions would suggest proceeding gradually.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Boltho and Glyn (2006)</ref> highlight the differences in consolidation efforts in the 1980s and 1990s:<lb/> while in the 1980s, inflation and balance-of-payment problems constituted the greatest threat following the<lb/> oil shocks, in the 1990s, long-term debt sustainability became the major concern. In addition, the run up to<lb/> the EMU provided an impetus to consolidation efforts. Among the few studies looking at the impact of<lb/> financial crises on the start or the probability of success of fiscal consolidations, <ref type="biblio">Barrios et al. (2010)</ref> found<lb/> that the fall-out from the crises may hinder the necessary retrenchment. Undertaking consolidation once the<lb/> financial crisis is resolved and choosing a cold shower strategy increases the chance to succeed. This may<lb/> be related to the use of public funds that the repair of the financial sector often necessitates and as long as<lb/> the cost of bailouts is unclear, fiscal consolidation programmes may not be credible.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of high debt levels on the probability of successful consolidation hinges upon model<lb/> specifications. For example, <ref type="biblio">Barrios et al. (2010)</ref> using two different approaches find either a positive or<lb/> negative net impact of debt.<lb/></p>

			<p>The composition of fiscal consolidation matters for the probability of success of consolidations:<lb/> retrenchments based on expenditure cuts are found to be more effective (<ref type="biblio">Alesina and Ardagna, 1998, 2009;<lb/> von Hagen et al., 2002; Guichard et al., 2007; Barrios et al., 2010</ref>). A possible explanation for the higher<lb/> effectiveness of spending cuts versus tax increases is that the former are often coupled with reforms that<lb/> enhance the effectiveness of budgetary procedures (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2007</ref>). Von Hagen and <ref type="biblio">Strauch<lb/> (2001)</ref> examined the probability of a consolidation to be expenditure based and found that a small output<lb/> gap, both domestically and internationally, a tight fiscal stance in other countries and a high debt-to-GDP<lb/> ratio increase the probability of a consolidation episode to be expenditure based. Revenue-based<lb/> consolidations can also be effective, if there is room to increase the revenue-to-GDP ratio, in particular if<lb/> the revenue types that are less harmful for growth (such as user fees, environmental taxes, property taxes<lb/> and value-added taxes) are under-exploited (<ref type="biblio">Tsibouris et al., 2006</ref>). Surprisingly, Alesina and <ref type="biblio">Perotti<lb/> (1995)</ref> found that the small share of successful adjustments due to increases in tax revenues comes almost<lb/> exclusively from corporate income taxes and not indirect taxes.<lb/> Past empirical work typically finds that cutting current government spending is more conducive to<lb/> successful consolidation (<ref type="biblio">Alesina and Ardagna; 2009</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Guichard et al. (2007)</ref> found that social spending<lb/> and transfers are areas where spending cuts should be focused to achieve a successful consolidation.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Alesina and Perotti (1995 and 1997</ref>) found that fiscal adjustments should focus on cuts in welfare spending<lb/> and government wages, if they are to be successful. However, European Commission (2007) found, that in<lb/> the 1990s, the positive impact of cutting primary expenditure on the likelihood of success became weaker.<lb/> This could be due to past consolidations harvesting the &quot; low hanging fruits &quot; . Interestingly, if the analysis<lb/> focuses on the European Union (27 members), spending on social protection, health and education<lb/> continue to increase during consolidation periods, while the bulk of the cuts are done in economic affairs<lb/> (which comprise subsidies, gross fixed capital formation, capital transfers and intermediate consumption)<lb/> and housing and community amenities (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2007</ref>). 5<lb/></p>

			<p>The literature is not conclusive on which types of fiscal rules and institutions affect consolidation<lb/> programmes. <ref type="biblio">Guichard et al. (2007)</ref> found a beneficial effect from a combination of expenditure and<lb/> budget balance rules. The European <ref type="biblio">Commission (2007)</ref>, on the contrary, found no significant impact of<lb/> expenditure rules in the European Union, though this study did not verify the combined effect with budget<lb/> balance rules. However, effective budgetary procedures appear to increase the probability of success<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2007</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Barrios et al. (2010)</ref> did not find a significant impact of budget deficit rules<lb/> on the likelihood of successful consolidation.<lb/> Successful consolidations may be accompanied by changes in the distribution of income. Alesina and<lb/> Perotti (1997) and Alesina and Ardagna (1998) observed that during successful consolidations, the profit<lb/> share often increases. <ref type="biblio">Alesina and Ardagna (1998)</ref> showed that the profit share increases not only during<lb/> but also in the aftermath of consolidations. Mulas-<ref type="biblio">Granados (2005)</ref> found that fiscal consolidations are<lb/> associated with higher income inequality, though less so for revenue-based adjustments than for<lb/> expenditure-based ones.<lb/> Few studies find convincing evidence on how political factors affect consolidation. Alesina and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Perotti (1995)</ref> found that coalition governments are mostly unsuccessful in attaining lasting adjustment.<lb/> The same authors also found that left-and right-wing governments are equally likely to carry out<lb/> successful adjustments, while centrist governments are less likely to do so. <ref type="biblio">Guichard et al. (2007)</ref> showed<lb/> that consolidations are more likely to start after elections in OECD member countries, while the</p>

			<p>Most of the literature applies similar estimation techniques to identify the major determinants of<lb/> success or failure of fiscal consolidations, but there is considerable variation across the measures of fiscal<lb/> consolidation, the definitions of the start of consolidation, the size of consolidation and of what constitutes<lb/> a successful consolidation (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). 6<lb/></p>

			<p>Earlier studies such as Alesina and <ref type="biblio">Perotti (1995, 1996</ref>) and Alesina and Ardagna (1998) defined a<lb/> fiscal consolidation episode using the so-called Blanchard index, which calculates a cyclically-adjusted<lb/> budget balance assuming an unchanged unemployment rate with respect to the previous year. In more<lb/> recent studies the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is used (<ref type="biblio">Tsibouris et al., 2006</ref>). The major<lb/> shortcoming of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is that it can also reflect one-offs and accounting<lb/> distortions (Koen and van den <ref type="biblio">Noord, 2005</ref>), revenue fluctuations due to asset prices (<ref type="biblio">Girouard and Price,<lb/> 2004</ref>) and growth surprises (<ref type="biblio">Larch and Salto, 2005</ref>). To address these issues, past analyses have typically<lb/> only used large changes. There is, however, a trade-off in setting thresholds high as it can exclude longer<lb/> periods of moderate adjustment.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a wide variation in the definition of the success of fiscal consolidation, which can be related<lb/> to its impact on deficits, debt or growth performance. The European Commission (2007) uses a cyclically-<lb/>adjusted primary balance based criterion, <ref type="biblio">Guichard et al. (2007)</ref> classify a consolidation episode as<lb/> successful, if its size is large enough to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio. <ref type="biblio">Barrios et al. (2010)</ref> use the public<lb/> debt level as a measure of success: a fiscal consolidation is considered as successful if it brings debt down<lb/> by at least 5 percentage points of GDP in the three years following the episode.<lb/> In the following empirical work several definitions of consolidation have been used. The choice is not<lb/> always innocuous. To highlight this, the main characteristics of past consolidations using two different<lb/> approaches to defining the episodes (annual tightening of the underlying primary balance by at least 1.5%<lb/> of GDP or a gradual but continual tightening of the underlying primary balance over several years) are:<lb/>  Size: The overall amount of tightening on average does not differ significantly between the two<lb/> definitions, being around 3% of GDP in both cases. The largest consolidations for episodes based<lb/> on the annual tightening are almost 9% of GDP whereas they approach 11% of GDP for episodes<lb/> based on sustained tightening.<lb/></p>

			<p> Pace: In consolidations greater than 1.5% of GDP tightening of the underlying primary balance<lb/> in a given year the average tightening is 2.3% of GDP (reaching over 4% in Hungary in 2007 and<lb/> Sweden in <ref type="biblio">1996</ref>). If the consolidation is defined as a sustained tightening of the underlying<lb/> primary balance, the average pace of tightening is slower at just under one per cent of GDP<lb/> annually.<lb/> 6.<lb/> The main estimation tools include probit, duration models and OLS, and more rarely the Heckman probit<lb/> two-step estimator. Estimates of the determinants of the start and success of consolidations may be biased<lb/> if not controlling for the correlation between the decision to consolidate and the likelihood to achieve a<lb/> successful consolidation (<ref type="biblio">Barrios et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2012)13<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

When the consolidation episode is<lb/> defined as a sustained tightening, the average length is almost four years with the longest<lb/> reaching 14 years (Greece between 1985 and 1999, when excluding the small reversal in 1995).<lb/></p>

			<head> Composition:</head>

			<p>The composition of changes in underlying spending and revenues suggests that<lb/> revenues contributed more than spending on average to consolidations based on the tightening in<lb/> a given year (almost 2% of GDP for revenue increases relative to almost 1% of GDP for<lb/> spending). For sustained consolidations, the contribution is more balanced, with a slightly greater<lb/> contribution from spending (-2% of GDP) than revenue (1.5% of GDP).<lb/></p>

			<p> Outcome for debt: For both definitions of consolidation, the level of debt on average changes by<lb/> a modest amount during the consolidation (rising by around 2% of GDP). However, the ranges<lb/> are substantial varying from a 12% of GDP reduction to over 24% of GDP increase for<lb/> consolidations based on the tightening in a given year. For the consolidations based on the<lb/> sustained tightening definition the variation is even more pronounced, ranging from a 25% of<lb/> GDP reduction to a 40% of GDP increase.<lb/></p>

			<head>Empirical results<lb/> The start of consolidations<lb/></head>

			<p>The main findings concerning the start of a consolidation are (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>): 7<lb/>  An important driver to start a consolidation is a country &quot; s need to consolidate, which is captured<lb/> by the initial size of budget deficits. Initial debt levels and increases in debt do not appear to<lb/> provide incentives to consolidate.<lb/>  Monetary conditions can help trigger the start of a consolidation. High interest rate differentials<lb/> before the consolidation episode appear to matter for the start of very large consolidations. 8<lb/> However, a depreciating exchange rate does not appear to matter.<lb/>  Fiscal consolidation in other countries appears to have an impact on adjustment programmes,<lb/> indicating a kind of peer pressure.<lb/>  Political economy factors can also influence the start of a consolidation. Newly-elected<lb/> governments are more likely to launch adjustment programmes. Governments that are far from<lb/> the centre and stronger are less likely to undertake a consolidation programme.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Probit analysis was used to examine the determinants of the start of consolidation episodes and in</p>

			<table>Table 4<lb/> the results for the underlying adjusted primary balance are indicated. Replacing it with the adjusted<lb/> primary balance did not change the results.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Long-term interest rate differentials are measured relative to German rates for European countries and<lb/> relative to US rates for other countries. The United States and Germany, as well as Japan and the<lb/> United Kingdom, are excluded from the sample for the calculation of average responses. Long-term<lb/> interest rate differentials are a better proxy for the perceived sustainability of fiscal policies than absolute<lb/> interest rate levels, which also reflect cyclical and other influences on global bond markets.<lb/> Table 4.

			<head>The duration of consolidations<lb/></head>

			<p>The main findings concerning the duration of a consolidation are (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>): 9<lb/>  A major determinant of the length of a consolidation appears to be the size of the budget deficit.<lb/></p>

			<p> Monetary conditions can have an effect on the duration of a consolidation. A depreciating<lb/> exchange rate provides a favourable environment for competitiveness gains and lengthens the<lb/> duration of the consolidation episode. Falling inflation tends to increase the duration of the<lb/> episode. A decrease in the implicit interest paid on debt also appears to lengthen the episode.<lb/> Replacing this variable by long-term interest rates (not reported) leads to the same result.<lb/></p>

			<p> Newly-elected governments tend to continue consolidations. The orientation of the government<lb/> does not seem to matter for the length of the episode.<lb/> 9.<lb/> The determinants of the duration of consolidation were examined using duration analysis and the budget<lb/> balance measure used is the underlying adjusted primary balance, but the use of the adjusted primary<lb/> balance leads to similar results.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<table>The composition of fiscal consolidation does not appear to have a bearing on its length. This<lb/> holds for over 20 spending and revenue items examined at both the aggregate and disaggregated<lb/> level. These findings are not reported in the table.<lb/></table>

			<p> The duration of a consolidation episode appears to be largely uninfluenced by the level of debt.<lb/></p>

			<p> Adding fiscal rules (sequentially) results in insignificant coefficients on the exchange rate and<lb/> interest rate variables, while showing no significant effect for fiscal rules, either (not reported).<lb/> This could be due to the interaction between fiscal rules and macroeconomic variables that may<lb/> work through the disciplining effect of fiscal rules or may be related to an omitted variable<lb/> reflecting the government &quot; s commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>The size of consolidations<lb/></head>

			<p>The main findings concerning the size of a consolidation are (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>): 10<lb/>  The length of the consolidation episode appears to be a major determinant of its size, perhaps<lb/> reflecting that it takes longer to achieve larger consolidations.<lb/>  Countries in the ERM tended to undertake larger consolidations compared to other countries.<lb/>  How the consolidation is achieved appears to matter for the size of the consolidation. Cuts<lb/> focused on social protection and housing and community amenities spending seem to boost the<lb/> size of consolidations. 11 The robustness of these findings could not be fully checked, however,<lb/> owing to small sample size for some specifications. A larger share of spending cuts relative to tax<lb/> increases does not appear to affect the size of the consolidation (not reported). 12<lb/>  There is weak evidence that newly-elected governments pursue less consolidation and that<lb/> left-leaning governments pursue smaller consolidations.<lb/></p>

			<p> Monetary conditions do not seem to play an important role in determining the size of a<lb/> consolidation. Exchange rate depreciation boosts the size of only very large consolidations, while<lb/> interest rates and inflation do not seem to matter much.<lb/></p>

			<p> The size of the deficit and the debt burden do not seem to be particularly important in<lb/> determining the size of the consolidation.<lb/></p>

			<p> Fiscal rules do not appear to affect the size of consolidation (not reported).<lb/></p>

			<head>The intensity of consolidations<lb/></head>

			<p>The determinants of the intensity (annual average consolidation over the episode) of consolidation<lb/> episodes are very similar to those of their size. The main findings are (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>): 13<lb/>  The intensity of large, but not smaller consolidation episodes appears to depend on the size of the<lb/> deficit in the previous year. The debt burden or an increase in debt levels only appears to matter<lb/> for very large consolidations.<lb/> 10.<lb/> The determinants of the size of consolidations were investigated using the truncated regression model, as<lb/> the size, by definition, is truncated, and the Heckman selection model, as the size of the consolidation<lb/> presupposes a decision to consolidate. The results of the two types of regression models are largely the<lb/> same. The underlying cyclically-adjusted primary budget balance was used, but adjusted primary budget<lb/> balance measures lead to similar results.<lb/> 11.<lb/> While cutting spending on social protection may boost incentives to work, to return to work or to work<lb/> longer, the finding that cuts for housing and community amenities matter is more of a surprise (though not<lb/> unprecedented in the literature: EC, 2007 has a similar finding for the EU-27 countries).<lb/> 12.<lb/> The spending and revenue items were introduced into the regressions sequentially.<lb/> 13.<lb/> The determinants of the intensity of consolidations were investigated using the truncated regression model,<lb/> as the intensity, by definition, is truncated, and the Heckman selection model, as the intensity of the<lb/> consolidation presupposes a decision to consolidate.

			<head>The success of consolidations<lb/></head>

			<p>The major findings concerning the probability of success in stabilising debt are (<ref type="table">Table 8</ref>): 14<lb/>  Economic growth appears to help debt stabilisation. This may come partly through the<lb/> denominator effect.<lb/></p>

			<p> An easing of monetary conditions captured by the change in the long-term interest rate seems to<lb/> increase the probability for a consolidation to stabilise debt. Moderating inflation similarly<lb/> 14.<lb/> The determinants of the success of a consolidation were examined using the Heckman bivariate selection<lb/> model as the success presupposes consolidation undertaken. To account for episodes of different durations,<lb/> the probit model was also applied. The definition of success is debt stabilisation following the<lb/> consolidation episode, with a couple of thresholds for the number of years after which debt stabilises<lb/> following a consolidation.<lb/> appears to increase the probability of success of a consolidation. A depreciating exchange rate<lb/> may help as well, but the evidence is not strong.<lb/>  The further governments are away from the centre, the less likely they seem to stabilise debt.<lb/> This finding is more robust for strong left-leaning governments than strong right-leaning ones.<lb/></p>

			<p> Fiscal rules appear to be associated with successful consolidations, regardless whether an<lb/> expenditure rule, a budget balance rule or a combination of the two is in place. In addition,<lb/> stronger rules seem to be more effective.<lb/>  Fiscal adjustment programmes during or immediately following banking crises appear to be less<lb/> likely to result in stabilising debt (not reported).<lb/>  Consolidations based on spending cuts are more likely to stabilise debt. Very large consolidations<lb/> only stabilise debt temporarily, if they are spending driven. Reduction in social security spending<lb/> and government wages likewise only stabilises debt temporarily if the consolidation is large (not<lb/> reported).<lb/> Assessing whether fiscal rules themselves contribute to fiscal consolidation creates difficulties.<lb/> Empirical work often finds that the presence of fiscal rules increases the probability of stabilising debt.<lb/> However, the causality of the relationship is often not assessed. For example, the finding may reflect<lb/> underlying government or population attitudes towards indebtedness, which leads governments concerned<lb/> about debt stabilisation (and reduction) to adopt fiscal rules as part of their fiscal consolidation<lb/> programmes. In cross-country studies assessing governments &quot; attitudes to fiscal restraint presents<lb/> considerable difficulties as comparable measures of preferences are missing. 15 So-called regression<lb/> discontinuity design (RDD) offers one way to identify whether the fiscal rules as distinct from underlying<lb/> preferences affect fiscal outcomes. RDD by controlling for country-specific trends can pinpoint whether<lb/> the introduction of a fiscal rule has an impact over and above the impact of unchanged or smoother<lb/> changes in preferences for fiscal probity. 16 The results (with 24 out of 24 different specifications<lb/> significant, though 4 specifications are significant only at the 10% threshold) support the independent role<lb/> of spending or budget balance rules in explaining debt stabilisation, after controlling for the other potential<lb/> influences.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Within countries such as Canada, Switzerland and the United States, voters &quot; preferences are used to control<lb/> for the incentives sub-central governments face in pursuing fiscal prudence.<lb/> 16.<lb/> Country-specific time trends and their second and third-order terms were inserted in the regressions.<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact of sub-central fiscal behaviour on central consolidation<lb/></head>

			<p>Central governments that tend to assume a large share in the burden of fiscal consolidation may need<lb/> to count on the support of sub-central governments. Although in some cases sub-central fiscal behaviour is<lb/> kept under control by fiscal rules, central governments may be forced to cover deficits and assume debt<lb/> created by sub-central levels of government, which may frustrate efforts to consolidate.<lb/> For the analysis, fiscal balances were cyclically adjusted using the Hodrick-Prescott filter and their<lb/> impact on the start, size, length and success of central government consolidation efforts was examined. In<lb/> order to assure comparability, consolidation was defined as an improvement in the cyclically-adjusted<lb/> central government and social security budget balance (using only cyclically-adjusted central government<lb/> balances does not alter the results).<lb/> For most consolidation aspects, the actions of sub-central levels of government do not appear to make<lb/> much difference. The start of fiscal consolidation, defined as any improvement in the budget balance does<lb/> not seem to be influenced by sub-central fiscal behaviour. 17 Sub-central government behaviour does not<lb/> appear to affect the length, size and intensity of consolidation episodes consistently.<lb/></p>

			<p>The contribution of sub-central governments to the success of a consolidation programme initiated by<lb/> a central government does seem to matter in some cases. 18 Success was defined as stabilisation of<lb/> government debt 1, 2 and 3 years following the consolidation episode. 19 The results for these regressions<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 9</ref>) suggest that consolidations by state-level governments tend to increase the probability of success<lb/> of central government retrenchment efforts. This finding holds when consolidation is defined as<lb/> stabilisation of government debt two or three years following the start of the consolidation. Consolidations<lb/> at the local government level do not appear to have a consistent effect on the success of consolidation.<lb/> However, some evidence suggests that they reduce the probability of a successful central government<lb/> consolidation effort. This finding is statistically significant, when debt stabilises in the following year, but<lb/> less so when debt stabilises in subsequent years. In part, the differences in the findings may be due to the<lb/> differences in the samples with all countries having local governments, but only a sub-set with state-level<lb/> governments. 20 Alternatively, the finding may either reflect that given the services local governments<lb/> typically provide a sharp tightening may be unsustainable without central government providing additional<lb/> support or alternatively that an overall consolidation effort requiring significant tightening at the local level<lb/> is more serious and will take longer for debt to stabilise.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Although higher balances at the local or the joint local and state level in the year before the consolidation<lb/> seemed to increase the probability of the central government starting fiscal retrenchment, these results are<lb/> driven by the three countries (Austria, Spain and Switzerland).<lb/> 18.<lb/> Sub-central governments do not appear to affect the length, size and intensity of consolidation episodes.<lb/> 19.<lb/> The determinants of the success of a central government consolidation were examined using the Heckman<lb/> bivariate selection model, which is an appropriate econometric technique since success presupposes that<lb/> consolidation is undertaken. The Hodrick-Prescott filter is used for the cyclical adjustment.<lb/> 20.<lb/> Sensitivity tests that restrict the sample to those countries with state level governments or only those<lb/> countries without state level governments suggests that some of the results are sensitive to the inclusion of<lb/> Canada and Korea.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>The analysis of past consolidation episodes suggests that there are certain policies that may be<lb/> conducive to debt stabilisation. This section provides a brief discussion of the policy measures and<lb/> economic environment factors as well as the political settings that appear to support debt stabilisation,<lb/> encourage governments to start to consolidate, boost the size and the intensity of consolidation episodes,<lb/> and prompt governments to continue the adjustment once started.<lb/> Fiscal rules are one of the policy measures found to be associated with a higher probability of<lb/> stabilising debt. The rational for fiscal rules is related to the reluctance of governments to commit to fiscal<lb/> discipline and the room governments have to abandon their announced plans before implementation. To<lb/> counteract these problems, explicit targets and fiscal rules can play an important role, though they are<lb/> difficult to design (Box 1). Fiscal rules can constrain government spending, spending of revenue windfalls,<lb/> the budget balance or debt, or a combination of them. The empirical work in this paper indicates that<lb/> countries that have either expenditure or budget balance rules or a combination of the two are more likely<lb/> to stabilise debt. The causality could also run the other way, as governments that are more committed to<lb/> debt stabilisation are more likely to adopt fiscal rules. However, an independent role of spending or budget<lb/> balance rules in explaining debt stabilisation was also found. In addition, more comprehensive fiscal rules<lb/> – that is the larger part of government activity and the larger number of government levels they cover<lb/> inter alia – are more likely to help stabilise debt. However, in this case, owing to lack of data, the direction<lb/> of causality could not be established and therefore it can well be the case that governments that commit to<lb/> debt stabilisation adopt more comprehensive fiscal rules.<lb/> The composition of the fiscal adjustment can also matter for the probability of its success. Very large<lb/> consolidations, that need to be pursued now by many countries, have a higher probability of success, if<lb/> achieved by multiple instruments. Past evidence suggests that a mix of reducing various spending items<lb/> – including subsidies, government wages and social protection – and of increasing several revenue items<lb/> helps.<lb/>  The empirical evidence shows that if the adjustment is spending rather than tax driven, debt is<lb/> more likely to stabilise and this stabilisation is lasting. However, very large consolidations<lb/> stabilise debt only temporarily if they are exclusively spending driven. Similarly, cutting<lb/> government wages only helps stabilise debt temporarily if the consolidation is large. A reduction<lb/> in social security spending can increase the probability of consolidations of any size to succeed.<lb/> But in the case of very large consolidations, the debt ratio will only stabilise temporarily,<lb/> suggesting that large cuts in social security spending may not be sustainable. There is some<lb/> evidence that cutting subsidies may help stabilise debt, though it only applies for very large<lb/> consolidations. Relying on cuts of social protection spending and on housing and community<lb/> amenities may boost the size of the consolidation, though they do not seem to matter for its<lb/> probability to succeed. Finally, the composition appears to have little bearing on the duration of<lb/> the consolidation.<lb/></p>

			<p> Revenue-based consolidations are often considered to be less effective due to the ratchet effect on<lb/> spending and to the adverse impact on growth compared to expenditure-based ones. A focus on<lb/> indirect taxes reduces the probability for immediate debt stabilisation, though this impact fades<lb/> away after a year. There is some weak evidence that relying on business taxes for fiscal<lb/> adjustment may help achieve debt stabilisation temporarily, but for very large programmes it<lb/> hampers debt stabilisation over the medium term.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Fiscal rules: design, implementation and creative accounting issues<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the multiple targets fiscal policy needs to take into account, optimal fiscal rules can be derived<lb/> theoretically, but they are too complex to implement. In addition, fiscal rules should allow for some flexibility over the<lb/> cycle, but too much flexibility may undermine them (<ref type="biblio">Wyplosz, 2008</ref>). Striking a balance between stringency and<lb/> flexibility also involves an additional implementation issue: the exact cyclical position of the economy may be hard to<lb/> determine, so that it is also difficult to judge at any point in time whether the government is complying with the fiscal<lb/> rules. Owing to these implementation and design issues, Wyplosz (<ref type="biblio">2005 and 2008)</ref> proposed that a fiscal council<lb/> should serve as a surrogate for a fiscal policy rule. He argues that fiscal councils could be a powerful watchdog.<lb/> There could be an intermediate way, with a fiscal council monitoring compliance with fiscal rules as well as taking up<lb/> other functions, such as providing independent forecasts and analysis of and recommendations for fiscal policy.<lb/> Fiscal rules may, in some circumstances, encourage creative accounting. This is more likely when complying<lb/> with the rules results in credibility gains for the government and the risk of being caught is low (for instance, owing to<lb/> a low level of fiscal transparency) or when the social cost of being caught is low (if, for instance, the electorate is<lb/> accustomed to creative accounting by the government). Creative accounting is less likely when the social cost of<lb/> missing fiscal targets is high or when the probability of being discovered is high. A high probability of being<lb/> discovered fosters genuine fiscal consolidation (<ref type="biblio">Koen and van den Noord, 2005 and Milesi-Ferretti, 2000</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The economic environment in which consolidation takes place can affect the probability of its<lb/> success. In the empirical analyses, economic growth and falling interest rates appear to help stabilise debt.<lb/> Growth reduces debt partly through the denominator effect, while declining interest rates help stabilising<lb/> debt through reducing debt servicing costs and cushioning the contractionary impact of consolidation.<lb/> Growth appears to matter less for the size or intensity of adjustment. Falling interest rates similarly do not<lb/> seem to have an impact on the start, size or intensity of the adjustment. The depreciation of the nominal<lb/> effective exchange rate seems to be conducive to reducing debt, which may work through competitiveness<lb/> gains boosting exports, though this effect is short lived. It also appears to lengthen the consolidation<lb/> episode, but has no bearing on the size or the intensity of the episode. Moderating inflation also seems to<lb/> help debt stabilisation, though favours a less intense and more protracted process.<lb/> The political setting also seems to matter for the success of consolidation: some evidence suggests<lb/> that centrist governments appear more likely to stabilise debt. Newly-elected governments seem to be more<lb/> likely to start a consolidation and also to continue it. However, as in the case of the policy variables, the<lb/> findings related to the political environment are also susceptible to omitted variable problems and reverse<lb/> causality. For instance, if the electorate cares about fiscal discipline, it elects governments that are more<lb/> likely to provide such discipline.<lb/></p>

			<p>The attitude of sub-central governments towards central government consolidation appears to affect<lb/> its probability of success. In particular, state-level governments can increase the probability of success and<lb/> the stabilisation of national debt if they consolidate during central government consolidation episodes. To<lb/> ensure that state-level governments do co-operate, the right regulatory framework with the extension of<lb/> fiscal rules to sub-central government levels may be effective.<lb/></p>
