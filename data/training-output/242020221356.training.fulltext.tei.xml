			<head>STI Working Paper Series<lb/></head>

			<p>The Working Paper series of the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry is designed<lb/> to make available to a wider readership selected studies prepared by staff in the Directorate or by outside<lb/> consultants working on OECD projects. The papers included in the series cover a broad range of issues, of<lb/> both a technical and policy-analytical nature, in the areas of work of the DSTI. The Working Papers are<lb/> generally available only in their original language – English or French – with a summary in the other. This<lb/> document is also available in French under the title &quot; Mesurer la mondialisation à l&apos;aide des tableaux<lb/> internationaux d&apos;entrées-sorties &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>Comments on the papers are invited, and should be sent to the Directorate for Science, Technology<lb/> and Industry, OECD, 2 rue André-Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France.<lb/></p>

			<head>THE MEASUREMENT OF GLOBALISATION USING INTERNATIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT<lb/> TABLES<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Input-output analysis has received renewed attention in recent years as input-output (I-O) tables are<lb/> increasingly used in the empirical analyses of different topics, such as material flows, environmental<lb/> issues, sustainable development, embodied technology, etc. This is partly due to the improved availability<lb/> and quality of national input-output tables as well as modern IT capabilities that allow for more complex<lb/> analyses to be undertaken. An area where input-output information has been used less is globalisation,<lb/> largely due to the fact that published input-output tables do not have the same sector classification and<lb/> price basis definitions, and therefore often lack international comparability.<lb/> Globalisation is high on policy and research agendas in many countries as the pace and scale of<lb/> today&apos;s globalisation process is without precedent. Growth in world exports and imports has been<lb/> accelerating since the 1980s, far exceeding the growth in world GDP. Since the second half of the 1990s,<lb/> globalisation has been particularly boosted by the strong increase in foreign direct investment (FDI).<lb/> Moreover, current economic integration is no longer restricted to the Triad – the United States, Europe and<lb/> Japan – but now extends to new large global players like Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs).<lb/> Furthermore, current globalisation displays some distinctive features (OECD, 2007a; <ref type="biblio">Grossman and<lb/> Rossi-Hanberg, 2006; Baldwin, 2006</ref>) as production processes are increasingly fragmented geographically,<lb/> resulting in the emergence of global value chains. Information and communication technologies (ICT)<lb/> have made it possible to &quot; slice up &quot; the traditional value chain (<ref type="biblio">Porter, 1985</ref>) and activities that previously<lb/> had to be carried out in the same location in order to reduce costs (Box 1). Instead of total industries and<lb/> their complete value chains, particular fragments of production are now increasingly clustering locally.<lb/> Important restructuring has taken place within companies and industries, resulting in the outsourcing,<lb/> offshoring and relocation activities. Final products and, increasingly, also production of intermediates are<lb/> being offshored within these global value chains, giving rise to increased trade through exports and<lb/> imports. Multinational firms play a prominent role in these global value and supply chains as they have a<lb/> global reach that allows them to co-ordinate production and distribution across many countries and shift<lb/> their activities according to changing demand and cost conditions.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2007)8<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. The Value Chain<lb/></head>

			<p>The value chain is a systematic approach to the analysis of the competitive advantage of companies,<lb/> developed by M.E. Porter in his book Competitive Advantage (1985). The chain consists of a series of<lb/> activities that create and build value, distinguishing between &quot; primary activities &quot; and &quot; support activities &quot; .<lb/> Primary activities<lb/> Inbound logistics: reception and storage of goods.<lb/> Operations: manufacturing and assembly of goods.<lb/> Outbound logistics: distribution to wholesalers, retailers or the final consumer.<lb/> Marketing and sales: marketing, communications and promotion.<lb/> Service: installation, customer service, handling complaints, training, etc.<lb/> Support activities<lb/> Procurement: purchasing of goods, services and materials.<lb/> Technology development: production technology, lean manufacturing,<lb/> customer relationship management (CRM), etc.<lb/> Human resource management: recruitment, training and development, remuneration.<lb/> Firm infrastructure: planning and control mechanisms (e.g. accounting).<lb/></p>

			<p>Another key characteristic of current globalisation is that it increasingly extends to FDI and trade in<lb/> services. Many service activities are becoming increasingly internationalised, especially as ICT enables<lb/> services to be produced irrespective of location. Improvements in technology, standardisation,<lb/> infrastructure growth and decreasing data transmission costs have all facilitated the sourcing of services<lb/> from abroad. Rapid advances in ICT have also increased the tradability of many service activities and<lb/> created new kinds of tradable services. In particular, &quot; knowledge work &quot; such as database and information<lb/> processing services and research and consultancy services can easily be carried out via the Internet and<lb/> through tele-and video-conferencing. Activities such as call centres have also begun to be offshored.<lb/></p>

			<p>As global value chains and the related offshoring may have important impacts on national economies<lb/> and employment, more accurate empirical measures of globalisation have been called for. However, the<lb/> new characteristics of globalisation make empirical measurement of current globalisation a difficult and<lb/> challenging exercise. While trade and FDI data have traditionally been used to measure globalisation, both<lb/> are too broad to measure the size of global value chains and the extent of offshoring. Due to the emergence<lb/> of global value chains, trade has increased not only in finished goods and services but also, and especially,<lb/> in intermediates such as primary goods, parts and components, and semi-finished goods. Exports of final<lb/> goods are no longer an appropriate indicator of the (international) competitiveness of countries, as<lb/> following the emergence of global value chains, final goods increasingly include a large proportion of<lb/> intermediate goods that have been imported into the country.<lb/> Data on trade in intermediate goods and services may provide a more accurate indication, but such<lb/> data are not readily available. Based on the broad economic categories developed by the United Nations,<lb/> 54% of world manufacturing imports in 2003 could be classified as imports of intermediate goods.<lb/> However, the drawback with these kinds of classifications is that they are based on some (arbitrary)<lb/> assessment of which goods and products can be considered intermediate, and which ones as final. The<lb/> emergence of global value chains makes this distinction even less clear, as close-to-final products are often<lb/> further processed in subsequent production and distribution stages within companies. The measurement<lb/> problem is even greater for the offshoring of services, as data on trade in services are far less detailed than<lb/> on trade in goods, while trade data do not typically identify if services are destined for final consumption<lb/> or intermediate use.<lb/> In general, official data on employment, trade and FDI typically provide some insight into offshoring,<lb/> but do not provide a complete picture (US Government Accountability Office, 2004). Firm-level data<lb/> (often collected through surveys) may provide the most complete information on the globalisation of value<lb/> chains and offshoring, but firms are often reluctant to furnish details on their outsourcing/offshoring and –<lb/> especially – relocation decisions given the sensitivity surrounding these phenomena. Input-output tables,<lb/> which are typically available for all industries albeit at an aggregated level, offer complementary insights<lb/> into the globalisation of value chains as they provide information on the value of intermediate goods and<lb/> services that have been imported from outside the country. A key advantage of I-O tables is that they<lb/> classify goods according to their use (as an input into another sector&apos;s production or as final demand)<lb/> instead of classification schemes that divide goods into intermediate and other categories based on their<lb/> descriptive characteristics. Another key advantage of I-O tables is that they also include information on<lb/> (domestic and international) inputs of/in services sectors, so that the fast-growing offshoring of services<lb/> activities can be monitored.<lb/> This paper brings together empirical evidence on the growing importance of global value chains and<lb/> the increasing interdependence between countries using the OECD Input-Output Tables Database.<lb/> Input-output indicators are presented for individual countries and individual industries, with the aim to<lb/> demonstrate the changing characteristics of current globalisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>The OECD Input-Output Database<lb/> Coverage – country and time<lb/></head>

			<p>Approximately every five years, the OECD produces estimated harmonised input-output tables. The<lb/> first edition of the OECD Input-Output Database dates back to 1995 and covered 10 OECD countries,<lb/> spanning the period from the early 1970s to 1990. A first update of this database (2002 edition) increased<lb/> the country coverage to 18 OECD and two non-OECD countries (China and Brazil). The 2006 edition 1 has<lb/> expanded coverage to 38 (28 OECD countries and 10 non-OECD economies), further strengthening the<lb/> database&apos;s ability to tackle global questions. The effects of globalisation and increased foreign outsourcing<lb/> of manufacturing goods and services, for example, cannot be properly analysed if some emerging<lb/> non-member economies such as India, Indonesia and Russia are not included within the dataset.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>			<figure>gives an overview of the countries that have been included in the different versions of the OECD<lb/> I-O Database. For this paper, the most recent edition has been used, with data for 1995 and 2000 available<lb/> for certain countries.<lb/> 1.<lb/> Including additional tables compiled after the first dissemination package.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Price basis<lb/></head>

			<p>In line with the 1993 System of National Accounts, the OECD Input-Output Database shows<lb/> transactions, wherever possible, in industry-by-industry symmetric tables at basic prices. Eurostat member<lb/> countries follow the basic price valuation system in producing the symmetric input-output tables. Some<lb/> countries have not provided the tables at basic price in the published input-output tables. The basic price<lb/> tables in the OECD format are submitted by the following economies 2 : Japan, Korea, India, Indonesia and<lb/> Chinese Taipei. Ideally, for many applications, temporal comparisons of economic indicators should be<lb/> made using constant price figures. However, constant price tables are only available in a very limited<lb/> number of countries and so the 2006 edition, like the 2002 edition, reflects current price tables only.<lb/></p>

			<head>Format<lb/></head>

			<head>Indicators on global linkages<lb/></head>

			<p>Traditional indicators using I-O information to measure the international orientation and dependency<lb/> of countries are the import penetration and the export share of countries. While the former measures to<lb/> what extent the total demand for goods and services in a country is served by imports, the latter shows the<lb/> percentage of the total production of goods and services that is exported:<lb/></p>

			<head>total imports of goods and services (M k )<lb/> Import penetration<lb/> =<lb/> ----------------------------------------------------<lb/>total demand for goods and services (D k )<lb/> total exports of goods and services (X k )<lb/> Export share<lb/> =<lb/> ---------------------------------------------------<lb/>total supply for goods and services (O k )<lb/></head>

			<p>Figure 2 indicates that the import penetration has increased in 32 out of the 34 countries (for four<lb/> countries only a one-year observation is available) and the export shares increased in 28 countries,<lb/> reflecting the increase in foreign dependency of OECD economies and major non-OECD countries in the<lb/> late 1990s. A typical observation that comes out of these international comparisons is that smaller<lb/> countries have a larger international orientation than larger countries. Smaller countries such as Belgium,<lb/> Hungary, Ireland, the Slovak Republic and Singapore are clear examples of this, while their higher<lb/> international dependency is also partially due to the large presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in<lb/> these countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Affiliates under foreign control are engaged not only in serving the local market in the host country,<lb/> but have become essential links in global value chains as they serve other (neighbouring) markets and<lb/> produce inputs for other affiliates in the multinational network. Data for US multinational firms show that<lb/> 65% of the total output of US firms&apos; foreign affiliates goes to the local market, while 11% goes to the<lb/> United States and another 24% goes to third countries. In consequence, export and import intensities of<lb/> foreign affiliates are in many cases higher than those of the average domestic firm, especially in<lb/> manufacturing (OECD, 2007a). In Ireland, for example, over 90% of the manufacturing output of foreign<lb/> affiliates is exported, and in Austria and Finland the proportion is over half.<lb/></p>

			<p>The import penetration and the export share indicators include final as well as intermediate goods and<lb/> services, and describe the global linkages and interdependencies between countries in overall terms. In<lb/> order to better assess the position of countries in global value chains, the foreign dependency of countries<lb/> can be better described only in terms of intermediates.

			<p>3.<lb/> It should be made clear that these indicators are dependent on the use of the statistical units in producing<lb/> national accounts and input-output tables, e.g. differences between countries in using establishment and<lb/> enterprise as statistical reporting unit may bias the results.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the average ratios (for the entire economy) of imported to domestic sourcing of inputs<lb/> for the mid-1990s and early 2000s, based on information in the I-O tables. These figures provide a direct<lb/> indication of the extent of economies&apos; integration into global supply chains. The ratio of imported to<lb/> domestic input increased in almost all countries from 1995 to 2000, demonstrating the growing importance<lb/> of intermediate inputs in international trade and the increasing importance of international outsourcing.<lb/> Consistent with their typically greater international orientation because of their limited size, smaller<lb/> countries are found to import more intermediates from abroad. In Ireland, for example, domestic and<lb/> international sourcing is reported to be equally important, meaning that the same amount of intermediates<lb/> is sourced internationally as nationally (i.e. within the Irish economy).<lb/> MNEs are again considered to play a major role as the sourcing of intermediates within multinational<lb/> networks has become especially important in recent years (OECD, 2007a; <ref type="biblio">Grossman and Rossi-Hanberg,<lb/> 2006; Baldwin, 2006</ref>). The share of intra-firm exports in total exports of manufacturing affiliates under<lb/> foreign control has been reported to range between 15% and 60% in OECD countries (OECD, 2007a). This<lb/> intra-firm trade involves the export and import of nearly finished goods destined for affiliate firms that are<lb/> mainly involved in marketing and distribution with little additional manufacturing processing taking place.<lb/> But another and growing part of intra-firm trade concerns the exports and imports by foreign affiliates that<lb/> manufacture intermediate products destined for other affiliates. This last form is directly related to the<lb/> globalisation of value chains and has been increasing in host economies like China, Korea, Mexico,<lb/> Chinese Taipei and some Eastern European countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Indicators on offshoring<lb/></head>

			<p>The offshoring of business activities including services has recently gained much attention, not least<lb/> because of the supposed adverse effects on domestic employment. However, the link between offshoring<lb/> and employment is not that obvious as different impacts have to be taken into account: direct and indirect<lb/> effects, short-and long-term effects, and employment and productivity effects. Offshoring (including<lb/> relocation) may lead in a first phase to short-term employment losses if certain activities are moved<lb/> off-shore or decline in importance. But globalisation has also positive impacts on productivity and may<lb/> thus reduce costs and prices, both in the activity being directly affected and in other activities that use the<lb/> products of this activity downstream. <ref type="biblio">Bhagwati et al. (2004)</ref> emphasise that even if offshoring lowers<lb/> employment and wages in certain occupations, in other cases it probably helps to create new jobs in the<lb/> home country.<lb/> A major problem surrounding these discussions is that the empirical measurement of offshoring is<lb/> difficult because of data availability (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2007b; GAO, 2004</ref>). A measure that has been widely used in<lb/> empirical work is the &quot; outsourcing &quot; indicator suggested by <ref type="biblio">Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999</ref>), calculated<lb/> as the share of imported intermediate inputs in the total purchase of non-energy materials of individual<lb/> industries. Typically, the information in I-O tables and more specifically the information in the imported<lb/> transactions matrix has been used for this.<lb/> However, it should first be noted that while Feenstra and Hanson call this outsourcing, it is in fact<lb/> offshoring, which is generally defined as companies&apos; purchases of intermediate goods and services from<lb/> foreign providers at arm&apos;s length, or the transfer of particular tasks from within the firm to a foreign<lb/> location, i.e. to foreign affiliates (<ref type="biblio">Kirkegaard, 2004</ref>). Outsourcing refers to the purchasing of intermediate<lb/> goods and services from outside specialist providers at arm&apos;s length, be it nationally or internationally<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The cross-border aspect is the distinguishing feature in defining offshoring, i.e. whether goods<lb/> and services are sourced from within the domestic economy or abroad – not whether they are sourced from<lb/> within the same firm or external suppliers (OECD, 2007a).<lb/></p>

Outsourcing and offshoring<lb/> National<lb/> International<lb/> Outsourced<lb/> Domestic outsourcing<lb/> International outsourcing<lb/> Insourced<lb/> Domestic supply<lb/> International insourcing<lb/> Location<lb/> Control<lb/> Offshoring<lb/> Source : Van Welsum and Vickery (2004).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Secondly, while Feenstra and Hanson&apos;s measure has often been used, there is no consensus that it is<lb/> the most appropriate. Girma and Gorg (2004) argue that this measure is too wide, especially for analyses at<lb/> the firm level 4 ; instead they prefer a measure originally developed by Abraham and Taylor (1996), which<lb/> includes only the contracting out of machine maintenance services, engineering and drafting services,<lb/> accounting services and computer services. <ref type="biblio">Egger</ref> and Egger (2001) and Helg and Tajoli (2004) also use a<lb/> narrower measure restricting outsourcing to outward processing. Others like Gorg et al. (2004) and<lb/> Criscuolo and Leaver (2005) have more direct data on intermediate inputs, including e.g. raw materials and<lb/> components, and services inputs as well as the proportion of these sources abroad. A discussion of the<lb/> measurement issues associated with offshoring is given in OECD (2007b), with a focus on related labour<lb/> relations.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, we have opted to build further on the work of Feenstra and Hanson<lb/> and used the OECD I-O database to compute the level of offshoring (OFFSH) as the share of non-energy<lb/> imported intermediate inputs in total non-energy intermediate inputs defined as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>OFFSH =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> + ∑∑<lb/> ∑∑<lb/> ∑∑<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> ij<lb/> m<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> ij<lb/> d<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> ij<lb/> m<lb/> x<lb/> x<lb/> x<lb/> /<lb/> where<lb/> ij<lb/> m<lb/> ij<lb/> d<lb/> x<lb/> x and<lb/></formula>

			<p>are the domestic and imported transactions of intermediates from sector i to sector j<lb/> respectively and i excludes the energy sectors (mining and utility).<lb/> 4.<lb/> Feenstra and Hanson have also proposed a narrower measure of outsourcing by restricting attention to only<lb/> those inputs that are purchased from the same industry as that in which the good is being produced.<lb/></p>

			<p>In line with the increasing importance of imported intermediates, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> indicates that offshoring<lb/> has grown in almost all countries, with, in some countries, very significant increases of the sourcing of<lb/> intermediates abroad. Not surprisingly, smaller countries typically report higher offshoring indicators,<lb/> notably Singapore, Luxembourg, Ireland and Hungary. Two large OECD countries, Japan (7.6%) and the<lb/> United States (10.3%) are found to offshore relatively little compared with other OECD countries.<lb/> Although the level in the large non-member countries such as Brazil, India, Argentina and China remains<lb/> lower than the OECD average, the offshoring of intermediates also gained importance in these countries<lb/> during the late 1990s.<lb/> The information in the OECD I-O Database also allows to analyse trends in offshoring taking the<lb/> manufacturing and services sectors separately. This allows to illustrate the increased offshoring of business<lb/> services in recent years. <ref type="figure">Figures 6 and 7</ref> indicate that just like in manufacturing, the sourcing of<lb/> intermediates abroad in market services has increased in almost all countries. While offshoring of<lb/> intermediates just like the trade of final products has traditionally been occurring in manufacturing<lb/> industries, the emergence of global value chains increasingly stretches out to services sectors.<lb/> Notwithstanding this increase, the level of offshoring is still much lower in market services than in the total<lb/> group of manufacturing industries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The same offshoring indicator can also be constructed for groups of industries and/or individual<lb/> industries, providing more detailed insights into the phenomenon of offshoring in today&apos;s global economy.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows that the sourcing of intermediates abroad is more prominent in higher technology industries<lb/> than in lower technology industries (higher technology industries are defined as high and medium-high<lb/> technology industries, ISICrev3: 24,29-35; while lower technology industries are defined as medium-low<lb/> and low technology industries, ISICrev3: 15-23,25-28,36-37). In most countries the offshoring indicator is<lb/> higher in the group of higher technology industries than in the group of lower technology industries,<lb/> reflecting the generally higher complexity of technology-intensive goods as they typically require a broad<lb/> range of inputs. The level of offshoring has increased in almost all countries in the higher technology as<lb/> well as the lower technology-intensive manufacturing industries, but sourcing of intermediates abroad<lb/> seems to have grown stronger in higher technology industries in most OECD countries.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> presents the offshoring indicators with some internationally open industries as examples:<lb/> computers, radio/TV/communications equipment and textiles. The offshoring of activities is somewhat<lb/> higher in the high technology industries, computers and TV/radio/communications equipment, than in the<lb/> low technology textiles sector. Again, smaller countries are found to source relatively more internationally,<lb/> especially those countries that have a high presence of multinational firms, an observation that is consistent<lb/> with evidence reported earlier in this paper.<lb/></p>

			<p>Input-output tables also allow for the computation of indirect effects on national economies in<lb/> addition to the more direct effects discussed thus far. Instead of looking only at direct imports, it is<lb/> important to compute the so-called induced indirect imports when analysing the foreign dependency of<lb/> countries&apos; economies (<ref type="biblio">Ahmad and Wyckoff, 2003</ref>). The underlying idea is that direct imports indicate the<lb/> direct contribution of foreign industries to the national production process, but this gives only a part of the<lb/> whole story. For example, if a computer manufacturer imports certain components (e.g. computer chips)<lb/> the direct import contribution will be the ratio of the value of these computer chips to the total value of the<lb/> computer. If the computer manufacturer purchases other components from domestic manufacturers, who in<lb/> turn use imports in their production process, those imports should also be included in the computer&apos;s value<lb/> in order to have an idea of the foreign dependency of a country&apos;s economy. 5<lb/> A (large) part of the intermediates locally produced by suppliers incorporate foreign raw materials,<lb/> intermediaries such as parts and components, and semi-finished products produced abroad. In order to<lb/> calculate the total import content, e.g. of nationally produced computers, one has to complement the direct<lb/> imports bought and used directly by the computer fabricants, with the indirect imports, i.e. the imports<lb/> bought and used by suppliers of these computer fabricants. These total direct and indirect imports are<lb/> known as &quot; embodied imports &quot; and are calculated as:<lb/></p>

			<p>where Am and Ad are the input-output coefficients for imported and domestic transactions respectively; u<lb/> denotes an 1 x n vector each of whose components is unity, the matrix O is an n x 1 vector of outputs, and<lb/> O k is total country output.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows that the embodied imports have increased in 33 of the 34 countries, clearly<lb/> illustrating growing interdependence. Again, there are important differences between countries with<lb/> relatively low levels of embodied imports, which did not rise strongly between 1995 and 2000 (e.g. larger<lb/> countries like Australia, Japan and the United States). Smaller countries present relatively higher figures<lb/> than larger countries because of their limited size, while at the same time the inflow of FDI has also<lb/> contributed to this higher import dependency in these countries. The typical examples re-appear, e.g.<lb/> Luxembourg, Singapore, Ireland and Hungary.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on these calculations of embodied imports, the foreign or import content of countries&apos; exports<lb/> can be constructed using national I-O tables. Input-output tables measure the interrelationships between<lb/> the producers of goods and services (including imports) within an economy and the users of the same<lb/> goods and services (including exports). As such, they can be used to estimate the contribution that imports<lb/> make in the production of any good and service for export. The emergence of global value chains means<lb/> that imports and exports increasingly move together since the production process of companies is<lb/> increasingly characterised by sequential production and back-and-forth aspects. As such, exports are based<lb/> to a large or small extent on intermediate inputs that are imported from abroad, hence the need to<lb/> qualifythe export performance of countries.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Hummels et al. (1998, 2001</ref>) have introduced the term &quot; vertical specialisation &quot; in calculating the<lb/> direct and indirect imported inputs that are included in a country&apos;s exports. As a result of global value<lb/> chains and the corresponding geographical fragmentation of activities, countries become vertically<lb/> specialised within the production process for some goods or services as companies tend to concentrate<lb/> different production stages for a single good in each country. The vertical specialisation measures try to<lb/> reflect this process by which different countries become part of a single production chain, linking the<lb/> imported inputs required by one country with its exports. Since then several papers have computed the<lb/> import content of exports for different countries, e.g. <ref type="biblio">Yi (2003), Bergoing et al. (2004) and Cardoso et al.<lb/> (2007)</ref>; all found that vertical specialisation has increased over the years, illustrating not only increasing<lb/> integration but also – and especially – the increasing importance of global value chains.<lb/> The calculation of the import content of exports using I-O information draws on some implicit<lb/> assumptions as extensively discussed by the US National Research Council of the National Academy of<lb/> Science (2006). It is typically assumed, for example, that the same input-output requirements apply for the<lb/> goods and services that are exported and those that are destined for final demand. Further on, calculations<lb/> are also based on the assumption that countries&apos; imports originate 100% from foreign sources, which is not<lb/> necessarily the case and may thus be a source of inaccuracy. However, measuring the domestic content of<lb/> countries&apos; imports is much more difficult as there is no input-output table that applies to the rest of the<lb/> world. Notwithstanding these limitations and assumptions, the study concludes that I-O data are the most<lb/> readily available source of information to gain insight into the increasing dependency of countries&apos; export<lb/> performance on imports.<lb/></p>

			<p>The foreign content of countries&apos; exports (FOR.CONT. EXP.) is calculated as:<lb/></p>

			<head>FOR. CONT. EXP. = u * Am * (I-Ad) -1 * X/X k<lb/></head>

			<p>where Am and Ad contain the input-output coefficient for imported and domestic transaction, respectively;<lb/> u denotes an 1 x n vector, each of whose components is unity, the matrix X is an nx1 vector of exports and<lb/> X k is total country exports. An import content of exports of 20%, for example, means that 20% of the<lb/> exports are directly and indirectly based on imported intermediates.<lb/></p>

			<p>The import content of exports is found to be highest in more basic industries that make heavy use of<lb/> primary goods (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). Examples are mining and basic metals, but also chemicals and rubber and<lb/> plastics. A second group of industries that displays a rather high import content of exports includes higher<lb/> technology-intensive industries that produce modular products. Parts and components are often produced<lb/> in one country before they are exported to another where assembly takes place. This international division<lb/> of labour is found in industries such as electrical machinery, radio/television and communication<lb/> equipment, and office, accounting and computing machinery.<lb/></p>

			<p>The indicators for the individual countries show that between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the<lb/> import content of exports has increased in almost all countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). In larger countries like the<lb/> United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, exports depend relatively less on the imports of<lb/> intermediates sourced abroad. The increase in vertical specialisation becomes clearest in countries with a<lb/> high multinational presence like Ireland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Belgium, as the international<lb/> sourcing of intermediates within multinational networks drives the development of global value chains.<lb/> Foreign affiliates in different host countries produce intermediates that are then exported to final<lb/> consumers, but also to other affiliates and the headquarters of the multinational company.<lb/> Within the group of emerging countries, China and Indonesia demonstrate a larger dependence on<lb/> imported intermediates. The results for China illustrate the increasing international production sharing<lb/> within ICT industries, in which the more labour-intensive manufacturing activities are carried out in<lb/> emerging countries while the more skill-intensive activities remain clustered in developed countries<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Srholec, 2007</ref>). A triangular trade pattern in the ASEAN region has emerged in which parts and<lb/> components are produced by more developed economies like Japan, Chinese Taipei and Korea, and then<lb/> exported to emerging countries like China where the assembly of the different intermediates into finished<lb/> products takes place. This restructuring process has particularly accelerated over the last years, suggesting<lb/> that more recent data would show a higher import content of exports for China (<ref type="biblio">Bolhoul et al., 2005;<lb/> OECD, 2007a</ref>).<lb/> While the indicator on the import/foreign content of exports is of interest and illustrates important<lb/> trends, one should refrain from using this indicator without knowledge of policy discussions. The<lb/> underlying presumption that an increase in the foreign content of exports is problematic, and indicates that<lb/> a country is losing out in the global competition (US National <ref type="biblio">Research Council, 2006</ref>). However, this<lb/> indicator does not necessarily say anything about the competitiveness of countries, and a growing import<lb/> content of exports does not necessarily signal shrinking competitiveness. It may even be the opposite if a<lb/> country successfully integrates the global value chains of high-growth industries. But the import content<lb/> of exports is above all a descriptive indicator about the (changing) structure and dynamics of countries, that<lb/> together with other appropriate indicators could be used in discussing countries&apos; competitiveness.<lb/></p>

			<head>Employment effects – job embodiment of trade<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD I-O database has also been used in a thought experiment similar to the work by <ref type="biblio">Groshen et<lb/> al. (2005)</ref> who, on the basis of trade data and input-output tables, calculate the net effect of trade on total<lb/> US employment. The Groshen study is among the few that not only focuses on the potentially negative<lb/> consequences of offshoring and the resulting raise in imports, but also on the potentially positive effects of<lb/> inshoring or exports. Both the jobs that may be lost through imports and the jobs that are created through<lb/> exports are considered. This approach measures both the number of workers that are needed to produce the<lb/> goods and services imported into the United States at current wages, prices and productivity levels, and the<lb/> number of workers that are needed to produce US exports of goods and services. Moreover, by using input-<lb/>output tables the study also accounts for indirect effects that are associated with impacts on other sectors.<lb/> However, it should be stressed that this approach has some major weaknesses because of assumptions<lb/> relating to constant-factor input shares, no differences in quality between goods, etc. Furthermore, because<lb/> in calculating the jobs embodied in imports as well as exports we use the industry technologies of the<lb/> country, it is implicitly assumed that the technologies for import and export goods and services are<lb/> identical. In addition, the figures are clearly the result of a thought experiment as imports and national<lb/> production are assumed to be perfectly interchangeable with no costs (e.g. in production technology).<lb/> Lastly and more importantly, because of its static nature, dynamic gains of trade which are typically very<lb/> important, are not taken into account. As such, the results only give a partial view of trade, and should be<lb/> interpreted accordingly.<lb/> In order to calculate the jobs embodied in trade for individual countries, the analysis firstly computes<lb/> the number of jobs that would be needed to produce the goods and services imported in each country. This<lb/> provides a sort of international trade &quot; employment loss &quot; , hypothetically assuming that all imports would be<lb/> replaced by domestic production. Secondly, the &quot; employment gain &quot; of international trade is computed as<lb/> the number of jobs that are needed to produce the goods and services that are exported from each<lb/> individual country. By subtracting the number of jobs needed to produce the goods and services imported<lb/> by each country from the number of jobs needed to produce goods and services exported by that country, a<lb/> net measure of the employment effect of trade is obtained.<lb/> The calculation of jobs embodied in trade makes use of the employment multipliers that are computed<lb/> on the basis of the national input-output tables for individual countries. These employment impacts are<lb/> then related to the value of gross imports and exports of individual countries. The employment multipliers<lb/> provide the estimates of how much employment in the total economy (taking into account direct and<lb/> indirect effects) will increase if the final demand increases by one unit. The employment multiplier for<lb/> each industry i is calculated as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>F i x (I-A) -1 x (O/LC) IO (LC/E) STAN<lb/></formula>

			<p>where F i is a row matrix representing the change in final demand for industry i with one unit, (I-A) -1 is the<lb/> (square) inverse Leontief matrix and (O/LC) IO (LC/) STAN is a column matrix representing the inverse of<lb/> labour productivity in each industry. LC is labour compensation of employment and IO and STAN refer to<lb/> the OECD I-O database and OECD STAN database. These employment multipliers are then multiplied by<lb/> the amounts of exports and imports, thereby assuming that the imports flows to final users in each country<lb/> are now produced in that country.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results are presented in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>; in order to easily interpret the absolute figures, the results are<lb/> also expressed relative to the total employment in each country. The jobs embodied in trade are on average<lb/> larger (in relative terms) for smaller countries, given their smaller size and consequently their stronger<lb/> international orientation. The size of countries, however, is not a prediction of whether countries &quot; win or<lb/> lose &quot; from international trade; smaller as well as larger countries show positive/negative net impacts of<lb/> trade on employment. Countries with a positive net employment impact are &quot; winning &quot; from international<lb/> trade as calculated here: the jobs embodied in their exports (the employment &quot; gain &quot; of trade) exceeds the<lb/> number of jobs embodied in their imports (the employment &quot; loss &quot; ).<lb/> Overall, the rather small numbers of jobs embodied in net imports relative to total employment clearly<lb/> suggest that globalisation is not the main explanation for worsening employment performance in some<lb/> countries. Globalisation is clearly a two-way process where offshoring and imports are compensated by<lb/> insourcing and exports. Only in countries like Ireland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic does the<lb/> &quot; employment loss &quot; of international trade seem rather large. Several factors explain these results, such as<lb/> the rather large trade deficits some East European countries have run as their economic development has<lb/> accelerated. Ireland, however, reports a positive trade balance; the negative net impact of trade-embodied<lb/> jobs is explained by the fact that the trade surplus is accumulated especially in non-labour-intensive<lb/> industries while sector trade deficits appear in low-productive, labour-intensive industries. Once again, it<lb/> should be stressed that this approach only takes into account static (direct and indirect) effects, and that<lb/> longer-term, dynamic effects are not included.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions and future directions for research<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite the typical disadvantages of published I-O tables (such as timeliness, sector classifications,<lb/> etc), this paper has shown that I-O may be a complementary source of information for measuring and<lb/> analysing globalisation. Using the OECD I-O Database, containing harmonised I-O tables for<lb/> 38 economies (OECD and non-OECD), different indicators are being developed to allow analysis of some<lb/> distinctive characteristics of current globalisation. The proposed indicators specifically measure the<lb/> emergence of global value chains with their corresponding import and export flows of intermediate inputs,<lb/> and the increasing offshoring of services can be discussed in more detail.<lb/> Of course the quality of the indicators presented directly depends on the information gathered within<lb/> national I-O tables and their international comparability. While I-O tables have been harmonised as much<lb/> as possible, reporting differences between countries (e.g. consolidated accounts, establishment vs.<lb/> enterprise) may to some extent bias the results.<lb/> The OECD I-O Database may also be an important instrument for future research on globalisation.<lb/> Linking the OECD I-O Database with bilateral trade data would extend the scope of the analysis; as such<lb/> the effects of the increasing integration of emerging countries like in the global economy could be studied<lb/> in more detail. While I-O tables typically allow for the calculation of direct and indirect effects through the<lb/> total economy, these kinds of analyses are confronted with the traditional limitations of I-O tables (lack of<lb/> dynamic effects and constant productivity).<lb/> The OECD I-O Database represents a major input not only for descriptive statistics as I-O indicators<lb/> could be used in more applied analysis. The impact of the increasing integration of countries on national<lb/> employment, productivity levels and growth could be discussed in more detail.</p>
