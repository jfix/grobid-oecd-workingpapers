			<front>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Improving Infrastructure in the United Kingdom <lb/>The United Kingdom (UK) has spent less on infrastructure compared to other OECD countries over <lb/>the past three decades. The perceived quality of UK infrastructure assets is close to the OECD average but <lb/>lower than in other G7 countries. Capacity constraints have emerged in some sectors, such as electricity <lb/>generation, air transport and roads. Developing and regularly updating a national infrastructure strategy, <lb/>with the National Infrastructure Plan being a welcome first step in this direction, would contribute to <lb/>reduce policy uncertainty and tackle capacity constraints in a durable way. The design of coherent <lb/>development plans by local authorities congruent with the national and local planning systems should <lb/>continue to improve project delivery. The government intends to finance a large share of infrastructure <lb/>spending to 2020 and beyond through private capital. Unlocking private investment in a cost effective and <lb/>transparent way could be supported by further improving incentives for greenfield investment, continuing <lb/>to carefully assess and record public-private partnerships, and promoting more long-term financing <lb/>instruments. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm). <lb/>JEL classification: H54, L91, L92, L93, L94, L95, L96, L98 <lb/>Keywords: OECD, United Kingdom, infrastructure, private investment, transport, roads, railways, energy, <lb/>seaports, airports, planning, financing instruments, public guarantees, public-private partnership. <lb/>************** <lb/>Améliorer les infrastructures au Royaume-Uni <lb/>Au Royaume-Uni, les dépenses dans les infrastructures ont été inférieures à ce qu&apos;elles ont été dans <lb/>d&apos;autres pays de l&apos;OCDE au cours des trois dernières décennies. La perception de la qualité des actifs <lb/>d&apos;infrastructure y est comparable à la moyenne de l&apos;OCDE, mais est plus faible que dans les autres pays du <lb/>G7. Des contraintes de capacité se sont fait jour dans certains secteurs comme la production d&apos;électricité, le <lb/>transport aérien ou le réseau routier. L&apos;élaboration et l&apos;actualisation régulière d&apos;une stratégie nationale en <lb/>matière d&apos;infrastructures, avec le Plan National d&apos;Infrastructure étant une première étape bienvenue en ce <lb/>sens, contribuerait à réduire les incertitudes au niveau de l&apos;action publique et de s&apos;attaquer de manière <lb/>durable aux contraintes de capacité. La conception, par les collectivités locales, de plans de développement <lb/>cohérents conformes aux systèmes de planification nationaux et locaux améliorerait la livraison de projets. <lb/>Le gouvernement a l&apos;intention de financer une grande partie des dépenses d&apos;infrastructures jusqu&apos;en 2020 <lb/>et au-delà en mobilisant des capitaux privés. Le déverrouillage de l&apos;investissement privé de manière <lb/>transparente et avec un bon rapport coût/efficacité pourrait être soutenu en améliorant les incitations à <lb/>investir dans des installations entièrement nouvelles, de recenser et d&apos;évaluer soigneusement les <lb/>partenariats public-privé et de promouvoir de nouveaux instruments de financement à long terme. <lb/>Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE du Royaume-Uni, 2015 <lb/>(www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-royaume-uni.htm). <lb/>Classification JEL : H54, L91, L92, L93, L94, L95, L96, L98 <lb/>Mots clefs : OCDE, Royaume-Uni, infrastructures, investissement privé, transport, routes, chemins de fer, <lb/>énergie, ports maritimes, aéroports, planification, instruments de financement, garanties publiques, <lb/>partenariat public-privé <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></front>

			<body>IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM <lb/>By Mauro Pisu, Barbara Pels and Novella Bottini 1 <lb/>Protracted underinvestment has taken its toll on UK infrastructure <lb/>Infrastructure is key for productivity and social welfare <lb/>Infrastructure contributes to productivity, economic activity and people&apos;s well-being in different <lb/>ways. Infrastructure can raise the productivity of private and public sector inputs and the marginal rate of <lb/>return of private investment, increase the durability of private capital, the volume of international trade and <lb/>generate positive externalities (such as agglomeration effects) (OECD, 2009; Agénor and <lb/>Moreno-Dodson, 2006; Yeaple and Golub, 2007; Sanchis-Guarner, 2013). Infrastructure is essential in <lb/>attracting foreign direct investment. For instance, a recent survey has found that transport infrastructure is <lb/>the second most important criterion for multinational firms when choosing where to invest, behind <lb/>workforce availability and skills (EY, 2014). Moreover, infrastructure is important for regional <lb/>development. The economic structure of the UK exhibits a wide dispersion in regional productivity and <lb/>activation levels, in particular between the South East, including London, and the rest of the country <lb/>(Ahrend et al., 2014) (Figure 1). Adequate infrastructure provision would be instrumental in lowering <lb/>regional disparities. <lb/>Figure 1. Regional imbalances in the United Kingdom are large <lb/></body>

			<body>Better integrating physical transport infrastructure plans with land-use and social policies can raise <lb/>well-being and social welfare, by reducing commuting times and contributing to green and inclusive <lb/>growth (OECD, 2014a,b). For instance, geographical and social segregation – and the ensuing crime – <lb/>often result from insufficient transport infrastructure. People with longer commuting time report <lb/>systematically lower subjective well-being (Stutzer and Frey, 2008; ONS, 2014). <lb/>The UK has been spending less in infrastructure compared to peers <lb/>According to different measures, public spending in the UK infrastructure has been lower than in <lb/>other OECD countries. Since the 1980s, public investment has been lower than in the United States, <lb/>France, Canada and Switzerland (Figure 2, Panel A). Rising private spending on infrastructure, following <lb/>the privatisation and liberalisation reforms started in the 1980s, has partly offset the decline in public <lb/>spending. However, cross-country comparable data on both public and private spending are not generally <lb/>available. Transport infrastructure spending data are an exception and they suggest that spending as a share <lb/>of gross domestic product (GDP) has declined from the mid-1990s and is now lower than in Canada, <lb/>France and Switzerland, although higher than in the United States (Figure 2, Panel B). More generally, the <lb/>government has identified major infrastructure investment needs in the UK to 2020 and beyond amounting <lb/>to GBP 460 billion (around 25% of 2014 GDP). Of the GBP 330 billion for which the National <lb/>Infrastructure Plan provides details, two-thirds will be financed by the private sector and the remaining <lb/>share by the government and a mix of private and public sources (HMT, 2014a; HMT, 2014b). <lb/>Figure 2.

Survey data, asking users about the quality of infrastructure, ranks the <lb/>UK 27 th worldwide on overall perceived quality of infrastructure, in the middle of the ranking among <lb/>OECD counties (WEF, 2014a) (Figure 3). According to another international survey of the quality of the <lb/>public transport (PWC, 2014), London performs well among 30 world cities, after Singapore, Toronto, <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>1995 <lb/>1999 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2011 <lb/>B.

			<body>Seoul, Buenos Aires and Paris, and on par with Madrid, but other major UK cities fare significantly worse <lb/>than London. <lb/>Figure 3. There is scope to improve the perceived quality of overall infrastructure <lb/>Value from 1 (worst) to 7 (best) <lb/>1 <lb/>1. <lb/>Figures refer to the following question: How would you assess general infrastructure (e.g., transport, telephony, and energy) in <lb/>your country (from 1 = extremely underdeveloped – among the worst in the world to 7 = extensive and efficient – among the <lb/>best in the world)? The United Kingdom ranks 27th out of 144 countries in terms of perceived quality of infrastructure in 2014. <lb/>The OECD aggregate is calculated as an unweighted average. The aggregate for G7 countries (excluding the United Kingdom) <lb/>(i.e. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and United States) is calculated as an unweighted average. <lb/>Source: World Economic Forum (2014), The Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015, Geneva. <lb/>There is evidence that the privatisation and regulation of energy, telecommunications and water <lb/>sectors have led to increased efficiency and reduced real prices for customers (Parker, 2004; Erbetta and <lb/>Cave, 2007). The UK&apos;s system of network regulation is sound as it combines low barriers to entry, <lb/>independent regulators and incentive-based price regulation. Network sectors – such as energy <lb/>transmission and distribution, water and railways – are structured around a model that incentivises private <lb/>operators to achieve productivity gains, with strict regulation enforced by an independent regulator. This <lb/>prevents the misuse of monopolistic power and reduces the time-inconsistency problem by making it more <lb/>difficult for governments to unilaterally revise previous agreements with a private company (Box 1). Roads <lb/>and flood defences feature minimal or no private sector participation and there is no sector regulator. Ports <lb/>have large private sector participation and do not have a sector regulator. <lb/>Box 1. The framework of network regulation in the United Kingdom <lb/>Economic regulation in network sectors in the United Kingdom aims to promote effective competition and, when <lb/>competition is not feasible, to protect end users interests by regulation. The key features of the framework are: <lb/> Private ownership of network infrastructure operators to drive cost efficiency and service delivery <lb/>improvements. <lb/> Sector-specific regulation with each regulated sector overseen by a separate regulator. <lb/> Independent regulators, within a framework of duties and policies set by parliament and government. <lb/> Price regulation in infrastructure sectors that are natural monopolies, such as the water system and electricity <lb/>distribution. Price regulation focuses on pricing policies, not on profits earned, to incentivise innovation and <lb/>efficiency. It usually involves price caps to what the regulated firm can charge the consumer. <lb/> Competition powers are shared by the sectoral regulator and the national Competition and Market Authority. <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>POL SVK MEX ISR <lb/>GRC ITA <lb/>CHL HUN <lb/>CZE IRL <lb/>AUS SVN TUR NZL <lb/>EST NOR <lb/>GBR <lb/>OECD KOR <lb/>CAN SWE G7 BEL USA DNK LUX ESP PRT DEU FRA JPN ISL AUT NLD FIN CHE <lb/>2014 <lb/>Average of 2006-2014 <lb/></body>

			<body>The framework of network regulation in the United Kingdom (cont.) <lb/>In practice, price regulation in the water, energy distribution, railways network and air transport sectors is <lb/>implemented using incentive-based regulation, based on a price cap and a regulatory asset base (RAB) model. The <lb/>RAB model aims to provide a credible commitment to investing companies about the recovery of their capital <lb/>investment. The RAB reflects the value of the assets necessary to carry out the required function. The private <lb/>company and the regulator negotiate a contract for a 5-8 years control period in most sectors. The contract stipulates <lb/>investment plans, required revenues and price caps. In most sectors, the UK uses the &quot; RPI-X price cap &quot; : annual prices <lb/>are allowed to grow with the Retail Price index (RPI), adjusted for &quot; X &quot; , which reflects expected efficiency gains agreed <lb/>by the regulator and regulated companies. <lb/>Source: BIS -Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills (2011), &quot; Principles for Economic Regulation &quot; ; Stern (2013). <lb/>The UK&apos;s network sectors have overall the least restrictive product market regulation and regulatory <lb/>management framework among OECD countries (Figure 4). The degree of competition is the highest in the <lb/>energy sector, telecommunication (excluding postal services) and railways, although there is some scope <lb/>for improvement compared to best performers in the electricity and road sectors. The success of regulated <lb/>infrastructure sectors is due not only to the technical specification of the incentive-based regulation, but <lb/>also to the transparency and quality of regulatory decisions (Stern, 2013). <lb/>The OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI) also reveals low services trade restrictions <lb/>(Figure 5). This measure includes domestic regulations – such as technical standards, regulatory <lb/>transparency and administrative requirements – as well as trade and investment barriers. The UK has <lb/>relatively low restrictions in the rail freight transport sector, maritime transport and in the telecom sector. <lb/>The STRIs for road freight transport and air transport are higher, although still below the OECD average. <lb/></body>

			<body>An overarching strategy and a sound institutional framework are key to improving infrastructure <lb/>A strong policy framework is required to effectively build, maintain and manage the infrastructure <lb/>stock of a country. Strong institutional setting, leading to credible policy commitments, improves <lb/>infrastructure outcomes (Esfahani and Ramirez, 2003; Andres et al., 2007; Henisz, 2002; Égert, 2009). <lb/>Despite the UK&apos;s sound network regulation framework, which provides strong incentives for efficiency <lb/>gains, policy uncertainty is one of the major risk factors that currently hamper private infrastructure <lb/>investment (NAO, 2013). This is partly attributable to insufficient long-term planning, which has made it <lb/>difficult to build a broad political consensus on contentious projects and resulted in delays in infrastructure <lb/>provision. The launch of the National Infrastructure Plan in 2010 and its regular updates since then <lb/>represent the first steps in the right direction towards providing a comprehensive view of the country&apos;s <lb/>infrastructure needs and how the government plans to meet them. <lb/>The UK needs to further develop a comprehensive long-term infrastructure strategy <lb/>Rising private sector participation since the 1980s in the absence of a coherent long-term <lb/>infrastructure strategy, while improving efficiency and making service quality more responsive to client <lb/>needs, may have led to sector fragmentation, impaired an across-sector view of infrastructure and, in some <lb/>cases, could have weakened accountability for investment to build sufficient long-term capacity <lb/>(Armitt, 2013). The government&apos;s 2010 cost review (HMT, 2014c) highlighted that more certainty about <lb/>investment plans would allow private investors to develop the right skills, products and solutions to lower <lb/>the costs of infrastructure projects, which are higher than in other European countries. <lb/>Several examples illustrate existing long-term planning difficulties. A 2003 White Paper set out a <lb/>30-year strategy that identified the need for additional runways in the South East. However, no progresses <lb/>followed the White Paper and, more recently, an Airports Commission has been created and is expected to <lb/>publish its final recommendation in 2015, a delay of 12 years since the issue was raised. Insufficient <lb/>investment in electricity generation by private-sector companies, which are not under the purview of the <lb/>energy regulator, has resulted in severe capacity constraints now manifest (see below). Moreover, recent <lb/>surveys have found that a number of firms considered but decided not to enter the retail energy market <lb/>because of the political uncertainties on the future course of energy policies (Ofgem, 2014a, CBI, 2011a). <lb/>Also, a 2011 survey among British businesses found that the major impediments to infrastructure <lb/>investment in the UK were the absence of a clear overall government strategy, delays and costs in the <lb/>planning system, and regulatory burdens (CBI, 2011b). <lb/>The National Infrastructure Plan (NIP), launched in 2010, is the first welcome attempt by a UK <lb/>government to provide a broad vision of the infrastructure investment required to underpin UK&apos;s long-term <lb/>growth. The NIP has been regularly updated and lists major planned and potential infrastructure <lb/>investments in the UK to 2020 and beyond for about GBP 460 billion (around 25% of 2014 GDP) <lb/>(HMT, 2014a). The energy sector takes up the largest share of the planned investment, followed by <lb/>transport (Figure 6). Of about 550 planned projects and programmes from the fiscal year 2014-15 until <lb/>2020-21 and beyond, 66% of financing is from the private sector, 21% is from the public sector and 14% <lb/>is from mixed (public-private) source. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/>14 <lb/>Figure 6.

Includes public and private investment. UK-wide projects may <lb/>impact on several regions. The total value of infrastructure projects is GBP 466 billion while the total number of programmes <lb/>and projects is 551. <lb/>Source: HM Treasury (2014), &quot;National Infrastructure Pipeline 2014&quot;, December. <lb/>The NIP provides a comprehensive and useful list of ongoing and planned infrastructure projects but <lb/>the strategic component of the NIP could be further developed. There is growing consensus that the UK&apos;s <lb/>infrastructure strategy needs to be enhanced (WEF, 2014b; LSE Growth commission, 2013). Expanding <lb/>the long-term infrastructure strategy component of the National Infrastructure Plan would contribute to <lb/>raise the level of debate on infrastructure needs and policies, thus contributing to lower policy uncertainty. <lb/>Lower policy uncertainty would, in turn, be conducive to higher private infrastructure investment. Strategic <lb/>infrastructure planning requires a long-time horizon – 20-30 years or more – and incorporating projections <lb/>for all drivers of economic and social change (OECD, 2012a). The Netherlands provides an example of <lb/>coherent long-term infrastructure strategy based on a long-time horizon and considering wide policy <lb/>objectives (Box 2). <lb/>Box 2. Long-term infrastructure planning in the Netherlands <lb/>The Netherlands has a long tradition of long-term strategic infrastructure planning. The framework changed in <lb/>2006, giving more powers to local authorities. Still, with regard to national projects and aims, the national government <lb/>develops an overarching long-term plan. Previously, a &quot; Key Planning Decision &quot; (Planologische Kern Beslissing) with a <lb/>time horizon of 20 years, defining potential projects in line with wider policy objectives, was developed and adopted by <lb/>parliament. In the new framework, the government adopts a general &quot; Structural Vision &quot; , which focuses on nationally <lb/>significant planning decisions and is discussed in parliament. In a second stage, the central government, together with <lb/>local authorities, agrees on regional agendas ( &quot; gebiedsagenda &quot; ), which describe the vision and potential projects for <lb/>the region in the medium term. In addition, a multi-year programme ( &quot; MIRT &quot; ) is developed, which includes a set of <lb/>specific fully-funded projects to implement the regional agendas. A set of decision-making procedures on stakeholder <lb/>involvement and decision making is laid out for the MIRT. The advantage of the Dutch system is that, in line with the <lb/>political tradition of the country, a political consensus is sought on the long-term infrastructure strategy and specific <lb/>projects. <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>Research <lb/>Waste <lb/>Flood <lb/>Digital <lb/>Water <lb/>Transport <lb/>Energy <lb/>Value <lb/>Number of programmes and projects <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>

			<body>Infrastructure challenges <lb/>Road sector: Dealing with congestion and moving towards an independent regulator <lb/>The perceived quality of the UK&apos;s road system is worse than in most OECD countries of similar size <lb/>and wealth (Figure 7, Panel A).

			<body>A wider utilisation of toll roads and congestion charges would contribute to a more rational use of <lb/>road infrastructure, with the Highways Agency acting as a regulator. Currently, user charges are <lb/>underutilised in the UK road sector compared to many other European countries. There is only one toll <lb/>road (the M6 Toll) – plus a small number of bridges and tunnels where tolls are collected – and only <lb/>London and Durham (the latter for just one street) have congestion charges. The deployment of a user-paid <lb/>toll system for the busiest parts the road network, ideally with charges varying over time, would be in line <lb/>with the &quot; user pays &quot; principle for transport (EC, 2008). Importantly, it would contribute to a more rational <lb/>use of roads by pricing congestion and therefore smoothing peaks in road traffic. Equity issues arising from <lb/>an increased use of toll roads can be effectively dealt with targeted social policies. <lb/>Railways: Sustaining modernisation efforts and revising the franchising framework <lb/>The railway sector has been significantly modernised in the last 20 years and the perceived quality of <lb/>railroad infrastructure has continued to edge up (Figure 9, Panel A). This can be partly ascribed to <lb/>increased investment, which started in the late 1990s-early 2000s (Figure 9, Panel B). Since the late 1990s, <lb/>passenger journeys have more than doubled (Figure 9, Panel C). At the same time, overcrowding in some <lb/>of the busiest railway sections (London and South East) has remained frequent, in contrast to the <lb/>downward trend in the pre-privatisation period ending in 1994 (Figure 9, Panel D). Passenger traffic is <lb/>forecast to rise further by nearly 15% between 2013-14 and 2018-19 (DfT, 2012a). OECD estimates point <lb/>at still significant railway investment needs in the UK up to 2030, with a cumulative amount equivalent to <lb/>about 3.5% of today&apos;s GDP, but which are lower than for Italy, Japan and Germany and below the OECD <lb/>average (Figure 10, Panel A) (OECD, 2012a). Such investments will be needed to sustain strong <lb/>performance metrics of safety, customer satisfaction and punctuality (Figure 10, Panels B, C and D). <lb/>Network Rail plans to spend GBP 38 billion (2% of 2014 GDP) between 2014 and 2019. <lb/>The government privatised railways in 1994-95, but its support to the railway industry remains <lb/>significant as passenger traffic has been rising over time. In 2012-13, it amounted to about GBP 5 billion <lb/>against total railway industry expenditure (excluding government support) of more than GBP 12 billion <lb/>and total industry income about GBP 9 billion (ORR, 2014). Government support increased further in <lb/>2013-14 to above GBP 5 billion, the third highest level ever recorded. The government&apos;s railway strategy <lb/>up to 2019 includes close to GBP 5 billion for infrastructure enhancements, including major projects such <lb/>as Thameslink and Crossrail in London, the Intercity Express Programme on the Great Western and East <lb/>Coast Main Lines and elements of the Northern Hub, the latter aimed at improving connectivity within the <lb/>North of England (HMT, 2013). Government financial support for such projects has increased every year <lb/>since 2009-10. <lb/>The government should make sure that resources to fund a possible extension of the high-speed <lb/>network are not diverted from the maintenance and improvement of the regular network. The UK has a <lb/>small high-speed rail system compared to other European countries such as France, Germany, Spain and <lb/>Italy. Currently, there is only one line (HS1) connecting London with the channel tunnel and France. The <lb/>government has plans for a second high speed rail line (HS2) connecting London with Birmingham and, in <lb/>a second phase, with Manchester and Leeds. The project is costly (estimated at GBP 50 billion or nearly <lb/>3% of GDP), but the Department for Transport has carried out a cost-benefit analysis which shows that <lb/>HS2 should offer value for money (DfT, 2013). However, such evaluations are complex and HS2 could <lb/>also cause a spatial re-organisation of economic activity in the UK resulting in additional economic <lb/>benefits and costs, which cost-benefit analyses cannot capture as they focus on marginal changes <lb/>(Rosewell and Venables, 2013; Crozet, 2013). For instance, HS2 could potentially result in GBP 8-15 <lb/>billion in productivity gains for the British economy in 2037 (in 2013 prices), with up to half of this total <lb/>gain generated outside Greater London by the use of freed-up railways capacity to improve rail services on <lb/>the established network, particularly on long-distance routes (KPMG, 2013). <lb/></body>

			<body>of co-ordination and misaligned incentives between large and centralised company owning and managing <lb/>railway track (namely Network Rail) and numerous and much smaller train operating companies. Also, the <lb/>costs of the rolling stock in the UK, which accounted for about 70% of total private investment in railways <lb/>in 2013–14 (ORR, 2014), are 40-60% higher than in other European countries, due to the complexity and <lb/>structure of the train fleet, a higher share of diesel trains, shorter trains and a less favourable age structure <lb/>of the rolling stock (Civity, 2012). <lb/>Costs could be lowered by promoting more co-operation between train operating companies and <lb/>Network Rail and better aligning their incentives (Brown, 2013; McNulty, 2011). The government could <lb/>increase standardisation of the rolling stock and seek a more effective procurement of it (McNulty, 2011; <lb/>Brown, 2013). Recent reforms freeing the companies owning the rolling stock from the obligation of <lb/>offering leases at the same price and terms to each bidder for a railway franchise and for the full length of <lb/>the franchise goes in the right direction as this should allow bidders to negotiate better leasing deals <lb/>(Brown, 2013). Reducing costs will free additional resources for investment and maintenance of the <lb/>railway system without the need of recurring to significant increases in rail fares, which have increased by <lb/>more than 50% since 2004 (ORR, 2014) and are already high by international standards (TUC, 2014). <lb/>Giving the responsibility of franchising to an agency at arms-length from the government could be <lb/>beneficial. Awarding franchises for passenger rail traffic is currently the responsibility of the Department <lb/>for Transport. But criticism of the franchise framework is widespread, as it has proved difficult to deliver <lb/>in terms of performance and costs to users and taxpayers. For instance, in 2012, the public tender for the <lb/>InterCity West Coast franchise was cancelled due to technical flaws (Brown, 2013). A 2013 report by the <lb/>Transport Committee of the House of Commons was positive about the idea to move decisions on <lb/>franchise contracts to a body at arm&apos;s length from the government (Transport Committee, 2013). <lb/>Air transport: Tackling supply bottlenecks <lb/>The UK has a dynamic and competitive air transport sector, but airport capacity in the South of <lb/>England is constrained. The UK has the biggest aviation market in Europe and the UK&apos;s main airports <lb/>operate their infrastructure more cost-efficiently than other countries – Heathrow is the busiest two-runway <lb/>airport in the world and Gatwick is the busiest single runway airport (Airports Commission, 2013). <lb/>The regulatory framework of the air transport sector is of good quality and has ensured strong <lb/>competitive pressures among airports. The aviation regulator – the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) – is <lb/>recognised for its competence. One of its important remits includes the economic regulation of airports and <lb/>of air-navigation service providers by avoiding abuse of market power. The CAA assesses the market <lb/>power of all airports and if an airport passes the market-power threshold set by the Civil Aviation Act, the <lb/>CAA starts regulating it. Currently, Heathrow and Gatwick are regulated airports. <lb/>However, the combination of insufficient investment with rising levels of traffic has brought about <lb/>heavy congestion. Heathrow and Gatwick (along with Manchester) are among the most congested airports <lb/>in Europe (Figure 11). During the last decades, only two new runways, in Manchester Airport and London <lb/>City Airport, have been added (Airports Commission, 2013). The quality of air transport infrastructure is <lb/>perceived to be weaker than in some other countries, such as Germany, France and the United States <lb/>(Figure 12). <lb/>The next government should take a swift and final decision to tackle airport congestion, carefully <lb/>considering the recommendation of the Airports Commission, and ensure to maintain strong competitive <lb/>pressures among airports. After years of debates and reports on if and how to expand airport capacity in the <lb/>South East, no final decision has yet been taken. The creation in 2012 of an independent Airports <lb/>Commission has promised to break the logjam. An interim report was published in 2013, shortlisting <lb/>two options: adding a runway at Heathrow Airport or one at Gatwick Airport. The Commission is expected <lb/>to make its final recommendation in the summer of 2015, after the general election. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>

			<body>Sea ports: Maintaining high competitive pressures and supporting offshore renewable energy sources <lb/>Port activities have continued to expand, but further investments are needed to ensure adequate <lb/>capacity in the medium term. UK ports handle more than 500 million tonnes of freight per year, making it <lb/>the biggest port industry in Europe. Because of UK&apos;s geography, the sector is crucial to the UK economy, <lb/>as 95% of traded goods pass through ports. The perception of UK port infrastructure is relatively good, but <lb/>not as high as in best-performing OECD countries (Figure 13, Panel A). Investment in harbour <lb/>infrastructure has been stable as a share of GDP (Figure 13, Panel B) since the late 1990s. <lb/>However, recent data show increasing congestion at UK ports (World Bank, 2014) and the <lb/>government plans to extend port capacity substantially in the next 20-30 years through private financing to <lb/>match the projected increase in freight traffic (HMT, 2013). Successive governments have encouraged <lb/>private participation in the port sector resulting in strong competition. Private sector operators manage <lb/>15 out of the 20 largest ports by tonnage and around two-thirds of the UK&apos;s port traffic (DfT, 2012b). <lb/>Overall, competitive pressures among ports in the UK are high (OECD, 2011b). <lb/>Ports will be essential to the provision of construction and maintenance services of offshore energy <lb/>installations. Ports already play an important role in the energy sector via the imports and exports of energy <lb/>supplies, including oil, liquefied natural gas and biomass. Because of the government&apos;s renewables targets, <lb/>decisions on expanding the port sector will have to take into account the need to support the development <lb/>of offshore sources of renewable energy. <lb/>Figure 13.

			<body>water sector (Figure 14). However, investment as a share of GDP declined in the sewerage sector. <lb/>According to Ofwat (The Water Services Regulation Authority in England and Wales), privatisation has <lb/>improved performance, with: i) 35% lower leakage levels than the mid-1990s peak; ii) 75% fewer <lb/>properties at risk of sewerage flooding over the past decade; iii) 99% fewer properties with low water <lb/>pressure; and iv) high standards of water (for bathing and drinking). Looking ahead, the government and <lb/>Ofwat should take action to increase competition in the water sector and find ways to further increase <lb/>consumers&apos; satisfaction. For instance, the introduction in the 2014 price review (for the 2015-2020 period) <lb/>of targeted rewards and penalties (i.e. price controls for different parts of each company&apos;s operations) will <lb/>encourage companies to find more sustainable ways to meet their customers&apos; needs. <lb/>Figure 14.

Currently, the biggest investment project since <lb/>privatisation concerns the Thames Tideway Tunnel (known also as the &quot; super sewer &quot; ), which is a proposed <lb/>tunnel running mostly under the Thames and central London to provide storage and conveyance of sewage <lb/>and rainwater discharges that currently overflow into the river (Ofwat, 2014). <lb/>The UK requires steady investment to manage flood risks, partly due to the effect of climate change <lb/>(Figure 15). Compared to other European Union (EU) countries, the UK has an intermediate exposure to <lb/>flooding of coastal regions partly attributable to rising sea levels (EEA, 2006). The most recent progress <lb/>report of the Committee on Climate Change, an independent body advising the UK government on climate <lb/>change, finds that many flood defence schemes require greater funding to ensure stronger protection <lb/>(CCC, 2014). In December 2014, the government announced a six-year programme of capital flood <lb/>defence improvement works in England, with a commitment to ensure real average spending growth of <lb/>almost 10% per year to 2021. The Thames estuary, which includes London, faces increasing risk of tidal <lb/>floods over the next 100 years (EA, 2012). The Thames Estuary 2100 Plan lays out steps to avoid such <lb/>risks, by monitoring climate change impacts and carefully assessing future investment needs, which <lb/>include options to replace the existing Thames barrier before it reaches the end of its useful life (currently <lb/>estimated to be in about 60 years&apos; time). <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.12 <lb/>0.14 <lb/>0.16 <lb/>0.18 <lb/>1981 <lb/>1985 <lb/>1989 <lb/>1993 <lb/>1997 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2013 <lb/>Water <lb/>Sewerage <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>

The regulator, Ofgem (the <lb/>Office of Gas and Electricity Market), first highlighted concerns over electricity-generation capacity in <lb/>2010 as old coal-and oil-fired plants were being phased out without sufficient new investment generation <lb/>capacity being planned. Action is being taken to strengthen energy production and spending on electricity <lb/>infrastructure has soared since 2010 (Figure 16, Panel B). Most of the old coal-and oil-fired plants have <lb/>already been closed and the rest will be shut down by 2015, and capacity constraints should decline <lb/>thereafter when new plants will become operational (Ofgem, 2014b). <lb/>The current energy sector structure emerged from the liberalisation reforms of the 1990s. The UK <lb/>energy sector is divided into three areas: i) the wholesale market where generators, suppliers and large <lb/>customers buy and sell electricity; ii) transmission and distribution networks at national and regional <lb/>levels; and iii) the retail market, where energy suppliers sell to domestic and business customers. Ofgem <lb/>issues licences to operate in each of these three areas. Its strongest regulatory powers apply to transmission <lb/>networks for which it sets periodic price controls and approves companies&apos; investment plans. No price <lb/>controls apply to wholesale and retail markets, on the premise that strong competition and consumer choice <lb/>will contribute to keep electricity retail prices low and drive sufficient investment in generation capacity <lb/>(in the wholesale and retail sectors, Ofgem is mainly responsible for monitoring market developments and <lb/>investigating anti-competitive practices) (IEA, 2012). <lb/>Notwithstanding the liberalisation reforms of the 1990s, the electricity and gas sectors remain highly <lb/>concentrated. They are dominated by six large vertically integrated companies, which are successors of the <lb/>former regional monopolies and still have a strong position in their respective regions (IEA, 2012). The <lb/>residential retail market share of these companies – in both the electricity and gas sectors – is about 95%. <lb/>In both sectors, the market share of small suppliers increased from about 1% in 2010 to about 5% in 2014, <lb/>-2 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>14 <lb/>16 <lb/>18 <lb/>TUR <lb/>NZL <lb/>BRA <lb/>KOR <lb/>AUS <lb/>DNK <lb/>IRL <lb/>GBR <lb/>PRT <lb/>IDN <lb/>CAN <lb/>CHN <lb/>IND <lb/>USA <lb/>JPN <lb/>NLD <lb/>A.

			<body>but it is unclear whether any of them will achieve sufficient scale, in the near term, to challenge the <lb/>incumbents (Ofgem, 2014a). The wholesale electricity market is also highly concentrated, with the <lb/>six largest vertically integrated companied owning about 70% of the generation capacity (Ofgem, 2014a). <lb/>Figure 16. Electricity infrastructure is being renewed <lb/>1. <lb/>Figures refer to the following question: In your country, how would you assess the reliability of the electricity supply (lack of <lb/>interruptions and lack of voltage fluctuations) (from 1 = not reliable at all; to 7 = extremely reliable)?

In its 2008 Retail Market Probe and the subsequent <lb/>2011 Retail Market Review, Ofgem found that a combination of factors, including tariff complexity, <lb/>vertical integration of the major suppliers and tacit collusion among them restrained competition in the <lb/>electricity sector. High market concentration in the wholesale electricity market has led to low liquidity of <lb/>forward contracts, resulting in low price transparency and blurring price signals pointing to the needs for <lb/>new investment in generation capacity (Stoft, 2003; Roques et al. 2005; Ofgem 2014a). Moreover, low <lb/>liquidity of forward contracts in the wholesale electricity sector has impinged negatively on competition, <lb/>by restricting market entry and hindering the expansion of small electricity suppliers and independent <lb/>generators (IEA, 2012; Ofgem 2014a). The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the <lb/>supply and acquisition of energy in the UK and will publish the final report at the end 2015 (CMA, 2014). <lb/>In early 2014, Ofgem enacted reforms to increase liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, <lb/>especially of forward contracts. These reforms impose new market-making obligations on eight large <lb/>electricity-generating companies in the expectation of increasing the share of electricity that is <lb/>exchange-traded (instead of traded over the counter) so as to improve price transparency of and access to <lb/>forward contracts by independent suppliers and generators. The government and the regulator will need to <lb/>monitor closely the effect of this reform and, if needed, take additional steps to further increase price <lb/>transparency of forward contracts. <lb/>There is also a need to quantify the benefits and costs of the consequences of vertical integration in <lb/>the UK&apos;s energy markets, which could be done by Ofgem. Vertical integration might reflect a rational <lb/>response to relatively high transaction costs associated with the operation in wholesale power markets and <lb/>results in efficiency gains for the firm (Coase, 1937; Williamson 1979; Jaskow, 2008).

			<body>realistic threat of entry. However, in practice vertical integration, combined with other factors such as low <lb/>liquidity in wholesale markets and tacit collusion among major suppliers, can restrict competition by <lb/>increasing entry costs and hindering the expansion of non-vertically integrated suppliers (Jaskow, 2008). In <lb/>its latest Market Assessment Report, Ofgem (2014a) stated that in the UK the costs attributable to vertical <lb/>integration might be significant and would deserve further scrutiny. <lb/>The Electricity Market Reform (EMR) programme is a groundbreaking attempt to reform the <lb/>electricity market and tackle capacity constraints on a durable basis, while promoting low-carbon energy <lb/>sources. Its main feature consists of two innovative schemes to increase competition, support needed <lb/>investment to expand capacity and promote the use of low-carbon energy sources in electricity generation <lb/>(Box 3). The mechanisms to achieve these objectives are: i) the Contract for Difference (CfD) between a <lb/>low carbon electricity generator and a government-owned company (the CfD Counterparty), with the latter <lb/>paying the former the difference between a fixed &apos;strike price&apos; and a market reference price (or, if the <lb/>market reference price is higher than the strike price, the generator will pay the difference back to the CfD <lb/>Counterparty); and ii) the Capacity Market, which will provide regular payments to generators for ensuring <lb/>a certain degree of spare capacity is available to use when needed. Among OECD EU countries, France is <lb/>introducing capacity mechanism to ensure adequacy of electricity supply over the long term (RTE, 2014) <lb/>whereas Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have already implemented some form <lb/>of a capacity remuneration mechanism (ACER, 2013). Both schemes will involve payments to private <lb/>sector electricity generators that will be auctioned and financed through a levy on energy bills. <lb/>Box 3. Main elements of the Electricity Market Reform <lb/>The Electricity Market Reform introduces two key mechanisms to incentivize investment in energy <lb/>infrastructure: <lb/> The Contract for Difference (CfD): its main purpose is to stimulate investment in low-carbon energy capacity <lb/>by paying the difference between the &apos;strike price&apos; – a price for electricity reflecting the cost of investing in a <lb/>particular low-carbon technology – and the &apos;reference price&apos;– a measure of the market price for electricity in <lb/>the United Kingdom. The CfD is essentially a feed-in tariff system for the whole sector. The CfD will provide <lb/>greater certainty and stability of revenues to generators by lowering their exposure to volatile wholesale <lb/>prices and protect consumers and the budget when electricity prices are above the strike price by having <lb/>generators pay back the difference. The CfD will support different kinds of low-carbon generation <lb/>technologies, but the support will differ according to the degree of development of each technology and will <lb/>be temporary as the government plans to withdraw it as renewable technologies become competitive. <lb/> The Capacity Market: its main purpose is to ensure a sufficient and reliable electricity generation capacity to <lb/>meet demand. The capacity market aims at increasing investment in electricity generation to replace older <lb/>power stations and get the best out of existing generation to provide necessary capacity for the intermittent <lb/>supply of low-carbon generation technologies. <lb/>The timetable for the implementation of the Electricity Market Reform is the following: <lb/> 2014-2017: CfD will run alongside the Renewables Obligation, which will be closed to new entrants from <lb/>2017. Established renewable technologies will enter a competitive auction to set the strike prices, with an <lb/>administrative strike price acting as a ceiling for bids. The first capacity auction took place in December <lb/>2014 for delivery of capacity from winter 2018–19. <lb/> 2018-2019: The Capacity Market starts to deliver capacity. <lb/> 2020s: Continued maturity of technologies and movement towards technology neutral auctions; additional <lb/>storage and interconnection, and well-functioning energy markets across the European Union, will play an <lb/>increasingly large role in managing supply and demand. <lb/> Late 2020s and beyond: Technologies are mature enough and the carbon price is high and sustainable <lb/>enough to allow all generators to compete without intervention. <lb/>Source: DECC (2014b). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>

			<body>The Electricity Market Reform is well thought out, but continued detailed assessment of the level of <lb/>public support available (as recently started in the 2014 Annual Energy Statement) as well as the <lb/>organisation of highly competitive auctions are needed to contain costs and risks to consumers and the <lb/>budget. Policies to support renewables, although desirable to accelerate the transition towards green <lb/>growth, can entail costs – for the Treasury, users or both – which in difficult economic periods might <lb/>undermine popular and political support for them. For instance, in Germany these costs are set to reach <lb/>about 0.8% of GDP in 2014, reflecting the gap between generous feed-in tariffs, which has boosted the use <lb/>of renewables, and market prices (OECD, 2014c). The government has estimated that the electricity market <lb/>reform could slow the increase in household electricity bills and result in yearly savings of about GBP 40 <lb/>(or 6%) per household on average over the period 2014–2030 for meeting the same objectives without the <lb/>Electricity Market Reform (DECC, 2013a). To achieve these targets, the government will need to take <lb/>special care to hold highly competitive auctions for the CfD and the Capacity Market and establish a robust <lb/>reference price for the CfD, which reflects market fundamentals and cannot be manipulated. The first <lb/>round of Capacity Market auctions was concluded in January 2015. <lb/>Digital infrastructure: More investment is needed to bridge the regional digital divide <lb/>The UK&apos;s digital economy is well developed as the country offers one of the most conducive <lb/>environments for the development of information and communications technologies <lb/>(Bilbao-Osorio et al., 2013). The UK has made progress in the rollout of high-speed services over recent <lb/>years, but it lags behind the best performing countries in the EU regarding the uptake of fast and ultrafast <lb/>fixed broadband, and the coverage of the latest (4G) mobile technology (Figure 17). However, the <lb/>proportion of fast fixed connection surged from 5% in 2011 to about 20% in 2014 and the average speed <lb/>has continued to increase (Ofcom, 2014). The gap between advertised and effective broadband speeds is <lb/>larger in the UK than in the other EU countries, while the costs of access to broadband services are below <lb/>(above) the EU average for standard (superfast) broadband (EC, 2014a). There are indications that some <lb/>small businesses face difficulties in accessing fast broadband (FSB, 2014; Ofcom, 2014). <lb/>The telecommunication market in the UK is highly competitive. The UK comes first on product <lb/>market regulation and among the best performers on regulatory management in the telecommunication <lb/>sector (Figure 4). Operators are regulated by the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which also has <lb/>competition law power. Ofcom reported that the variation of the availability and quality of <lb/>telecommunications services across the UK is partly attributable to the largely market-led approach to <lb/>service provision (Ofcom, 2013), in common with other OECD countries. Once the cost to the provider of <lb/>extending the infrastructure exceeds the revenues they generate, the provider no longer has an incentive to <lb/>extend the infrastructure. While Universal Service Obligation (USO) has virtually ensured universal access <lb/>to basic telecommunications, such as fixed telephony, the expansion of fast broadband coverage by the <lb/>private sector is more difficult to achieve. <lb/>International experience shows that market forces do not always lead to sufficient provision of <lb/>broadband services in all geographical areas of a country. For instance, empirical evidence for the <lb/>telecommunication sector suggests that allowing regulated access to incumbent&apos;s infrastructure, as a way <lb/>to increase retail competition, increases the quality of services – in terms of connection speed – but it may <lb/>also result in reduced investment, leading to lower broadband penetration (Grajek and Roller, 2012; <lb/>Nardotto et al., 2013; Crandall et al., 2013). Competition helps drive down prices and increase quality and <lb/>variety of services, but the authorities also need to create the right incentives to promote the access to <lb/>modern digital services and raise penetration rates in rural areas, as extending telecommunication <lb/>infrastructure therein can be highly costly and deter private investment. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>

This included a pledge to ensure access to broadband in rural areas even if it is not commercially <lb/>viable. The government has an ambitious goal of providing universal access to broadband by 2017, with a <lb/>minimum speed of 24 megabits per second (Mbps) in at least 95% of premises. The authorities are also <lb/>currently conducting a series of pilot projects to address the coverage for the remaining 5%. To achieve <lb/>these targets, the government will need to decrease the regional disparities in the availability of broadband, <lb/>which – in common with virtually every OECD country – are large, especially for fast broadband <lb/>(Table 1).

Broadband connections with a headline speed of up to 30 megabits per <lb/>second (Mbps) or higher are considered superfast. <lb/>Source: Ofcom. <lb/>The UK government should improve the competitive framework to award subsidies to expand <lb/>broadband services in rural areas. This will minimise the costs for the exchequer and accelerate the <lb/>achievement of the government&apos;s targets of providing universal access to broadband services. The <lb/>experience of Chile in awarding subsidies on a competitive basis is highly positive as it succeeded in <lb/>lowering the share of people without basic communications services from 15% in the mid-1900s to 1% in <lb/>2002 (Wellenius, 2002). Stronger government support to expand broadband access underpins the European <lb/>Commission&apos;s digital strategy, which allows for exceptional government subsidies for broadband rollout <lb/>(EC, 2013). The implementation of the government&apos;s rural broadband programme has been criticised as <lb/>only the historical incumbent (British Telecom, BT) has faced little competition or no competition during <lb/>the bidding process and won all contracts. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has argued <lb/>that the Department of Culture Media and Sport&apos;s procurement approach for the rural broadband <lb/>programme has resulted in too little competition among potential bidders (HoC, 2014). This has in turn <lb/>resulted in a lack of transparency about the costs the sole supplier (BT) actually incurs in deploying <lb/>broadband services in rural areas and in lower-than-expected capital contribution by BT (HoC, 2014). <lb/>Infrastructure is key to move towards green growth <lb/>Shifting transport to environmentally friendly modes <lb/>Passenger transport has increased considerably since the 1980s, mainly driven by a surge in the use of <lb/>cars, although it has stabilised more recently (DfT, 2014a). In 2012, cars accounted for more than <lb/>two-thirds of total passenger transport, walking for close to a fifth, local buses for about 5%, and rail and <lb/>other transport modes (such as air travel, motorcycles and tram) accounted for less than 5% each. Domestic <lb/>freight transport increased steadily over the 1990s and until the mid-2000s, thereafter it flattened and <lb/>declined as a consequence of the economic crisis. <lb/>Transport accounts for a large share of total greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, in particular <lb/>from road transport. In 2011, transport was responsible for almost 30% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, <lb/>compared to less than 20% in 1990.

In 2008, 80% and close to 40% of <lb/>particulate matter (PM) emissions in London and Manchester, respectively, originated from road transport <lb/>(Moore, 2012). Pollution generates large economic costs and negatively affects well-being <lb/>(OECD, 2014a). In the UK, the death rate form air pollution is around the OECD average. Although it <lb/>declined from 2005 to 2010, it is still significantly higher than in some other affluent OECD countries <lb/>(Figure 19). Surveys also reveal that in the UK almost half of the population considers exhaust fumes in <lb/>towns and cities as a major problem (DfT, 2014b). <lb/>Figure 19. Deaths from air pollution are about OECD average <lb/>Number of deaths per million capita <lb/>Source: OECD (2014), The Cost of Air Pollution: Health Impacts of Road Transport. <lb/>A comprehensive transport infrastructure strategy will need to ensure an adequate supply of <lb/>infrastructure and its efficient use, but also to shift transport towards more environmentally-friendly <lb/>modes, such as trains, buses and bicycles. In the UK, there is room to shift freight transport from roads to <lb/>railways, which would diminish the environmental impact of the transport system and would reduce road <lb/>congestion. Currently, the share of railway freight transport is slightly lower than in the other EU countries. <lb/>Several private rail freight companies operate in the market, which functions well as incumbents lost their <lb/>dominant position following the privatisation in the mid-1990s (OECD, 2013a). The government should <lb/>consider substantially increasing the freight grants managed by the Department of Transport through the <lb/>Mode Shift Revenue Support Scheme. These grants provide incentives to freight companies to transport <lb/>freight by rail (and water) instead of road. In the 2013-14 financial year, these grants accounted for slightly <lb/>above GBP 15 million out of more than GBP 5 billion of government support to the railway sector, thus <lb/>even doubling this amount would not have a large impact on the budget. <lb/>Supporting renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency <lb/>The UK relies on a large array of policies to increase energy efficiency and to promote the use of <lb/>renewable energy sources (DEEC, 2013a). These policies seem to be bearing fruit. From 2005 to 2011, <lb/>households&apos; electricity and gas consumption declined by respectively about 10% and 20% because of <lb/>energy efficiency improvements (DECC, 2013a). Greenhouse gas emission per unit of GDP almost halved <lb/>since 1990. This was mainly due to changes in the energy mix. Between 1990 and 2012, the share of coal <lb/>in total energy supply fell from close to 30% to 20%, from almost 40% to about 30% for oil, while gas <lb/>increased from nearly 25% to 35% (IEA, 2012). The share of renewable energy in total energy supply <lb/>increased from 1% in 1990 to 5% in 2012, still some way off the 15% target in 2020 as part of the EU <lb/></body>

Their <lb/>effects on energy bills, especially for poor households, will need to be closely monitored. In 2013, retail <lb/>gas and electricity prices for households were below the EU-28 average, while electricity prices for the <lb/>industry exceeded the OECD average (Figure 21). On average in 2013, energy and climate change policies <lb/>accounted for about 10% of households energy bills (DECC, 2013b). However, accounting for the effect of <lb/>the numerous energy saving policies now in place, the Department of Energy and Climate Change <lb/>estimated that in 2013 these policies yielded a 5% saving on the households&apos; energy bill. <lb/>Looking ahead, the government should consider simplifying the energy-efficiency policy framework <lb/>by moving towards a single carbon price applying to all economic activities, reducing compliance costs <lb/>and raising awareness across the population of the initiatives offering the highest value for money.

			<body>Box 4. The changing roles of the public and private sectors in infrastructure financing over time <lb/>Across history, there have been different patterns of private and public involvement in infrastructure financing. In <lb/>the 1930s and 1940s, infrastructure investment was largely made by the private sector, frequently with implicit or <lb/>explicit subsidies or other forms of government support. The private sector then came to be widely regarded as taking <lb/>too short-term approach and, as its investment record was considered insufficient, large parts of infrastructure were <lb/>taken into public ownership in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the performance of public infrastructure – airports, <lb/>highways, waterways and public railways – was considered unsatisfactory owing to cost overrides, planning and <lb/>construction delays as well as safety problems, lack of innovation and technological advance (Henckel and <lb/>McKibbin, 2010). To address some of these problems, in the late half of the 20th century, infrastructure investment <lb/>entered a new phase with privatization, new regulation models were introduced together with new ways of cooperation <lb/>under innovative legal frameworks for public-private partnerships (PPPs) (Wagenvoort et al., 2010). The PPP was first <lb/>introduced in the United Kingdom (UK), but it was quickly adopted by other European Union countries that nowadays <lb/>account for a larger share of PPPs than the UK. <lb/>However, rising public spending on infrastructure would strain the government&apos;s fiscal consolidation <lb/>plan. Given this tension, the government can at best reprioritize public spending and otherwise devote <lb/>greater efforts to attract more private financing. The government is already shifting public spending <lb/>towards infrastructure as it plans to increase infrastructure spending by GBP 3 billion each year from <lb/>2015-16, while adhering to its fiscal consolidation plan. This is a welcome move but unlikely to contribute <lb/>substantially to necessary spending on infrastructure, which, according to the National Infrastructure Plan <lb/>and the National Infrastructure Pipeline, would need to amount to more than GBP 460 billion to 2020 and <lb/>beyond (HMT, 2014a). <lb/>Attracting additional private capital in infrastructure will be key to financing the government&apos;s <lb/>infrastructure plan (Figure 22). Water infrastructure projects are expected to be wholly privately financed <lb/>and private finance should fund about 95% of investment in the energy sector. In transport, public <lb/>financing is projected to play instead an important role, providing slightly more than half of the total <lb/>spending. <lb/>Figure 22. The share of private financing for pipeline infrastructure projects varies by sectors <lb/>Per cent of total financing of infrastructure pipeline projects, 2014-15 to 2020-21 <lb/>Source: HM Treasury (2014), National Infrastructure Plan 2014. <lb/>Unlocking private sector investment by proposing ready-to-finance projects <lb/>Infrastructure projects are – in principle – attractive assets for private equity investors and debt <lb/>providers.

			<body>portfolios as the correlation between infrastructure investment and other assets is low, especially for equity <lb/>capital (WEF, 2014b). <lb/>However, long-term institutional investors (such as pension funds and life insurers) still allocate only <lb/>a limited share of their resources on direct infrastructure investment (Figure 23). Also, they seem to prefer <lb/>the secondary market, as capital can be deployed quickly across a broader range of assets and the planning, <lb/>construction and start-up stages of projects involve high risks that investors prefer to avoid <lb/>(Dewing et al., 2013). Globally, most of the investment of large pension funds is directed towards fixed <lb/>income and cash (around 60%), listed equity (nearly 30%) or other alternative investments (10 %) – of <lb/>which a tiny part, around 1%, goes to unlisted infrastructure investment (Inderset and Della Croce, 2014; <lb/>Subacchi et al., 2014). Among long-term institutional investors, only pension funds in Canada and <lb/>Australia have a non-negligible share of their portfolio (around 5-6%) invested in domestic and foreign <lb/>infrastructure projects. <lb/>Figure 23. The share of alternative investment in asset allocation is low <lb/>Per cent of total asset allocation, 2014 <lb/>Source: Mercer (2014), European Asset Allocation Survey. <lb/>The UK ranks 10 th among a set of developed and developing countries in terms of attractiveness for <lb/>private investment in infrastructure, although among OECD countries Canada, Sweden, Norway, the <lb/>United States and Australia all rank higher (Arcadis, 2014). Recently, the involvement of UK institutional <lb/>investors in long-term infrastructure has risen, also beyond the domestic economy. For example, the BT <lb/>Pension Scheme has recently taken a 13% stake in Thames Water (the UK water supplier), while the <lb/>Universities Superannuation Scheme, together with a consortium, invested directly in ConnectEast (an <lb/>Australian road owner and operator) (FT, 2014a). However, further action is needed to match institutional <lb/>investors&apos; preferences with the UK&apos;s large infrastructure needs. <lb/>While the National Infrastructure Plan and its regular updates are a step in the right direction, the <lb/>government should bolster ready-to-finance projects in the National Infrastructure Pipeline so as to attract <lb/>more private investors. Private investors are especially interested in ready-to-finance infrastructure projects <lb/>as the initial stages of projects – scoping, planning and consents – involve large additional risks. Between <lb/>2013 and 2014, the share of infrastructure projects having reached the stage of &quot; Consents Approved &quot; (that <lb/>is before the construction stage) declined from 15% to less than 5%; those in the construction stage <lb/>increased from 45% to more than 60%; those in the &quot; Planning and Consents &quot; stage were stable at around <lb/>10% (HMT, 2014b). The insufficient involvement of long-term equity investors is not due to shortage of <lb/>private capital. The combined assets of liability-constrained investors (such as pension funds and insurance <lb/>companies) and asset-based investors (such as sovereign wealth funds, endowments and family officers) <lb/>amount globally to USD 50 trillion (WEF, 2014b). A recent OECD (2013b) report for the G20 leaders <lb/></body>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>underlines that across OECD countries large amounts of equity capital have been allocated to infrastructure <lb/>asset class, but in fact they remain un-invested. This is because of a combination of factors, including high <lb/>returns thresholds for a given risk level because of perceived policy uncertainty. At the EU level, the <lb/>absence of ready-to-finance infrastructure projects have slow down the take up of recent initiatives to <lb/>attract private investors in infrastructure sectors, such as the Loan Guarantee Instrument for <lb/>Trans-European Transport Network Projects (Box 5). <lb/>Box 5. Recent EU initiatives to attract private investment in infrastructure <lb/>The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is aimed to be a catalyst for further private and public funding by giving <lb/>infrastructure projects credibility and lowering their risk profiles, thereby attracting investors. One of the CEF&apos;s key <lb/>elements is more systematic use of innovative financial instruments, such guaranteed loans, to provide a funding <lb/>alternative to traditional grants and fill financing gaps for strategic investments. <lb/>The high levels of revenue risk in the early stages of public-private-partnership transport projects can cause <lb/>difficulties in attracting private sector funding. Indeed, one of the major hindrances of a large private involvement in <lb/>transport infrastructure is the concern that user-dependent revenue (tolls, fares etc.) may not reach medium-term <lb/>target. Therefore, the Loan Guarantee Instrument for Trans-European Transport (LGTT) has been introduced to <lb/>partially cover risks for network projects of common interest and to receive income from user-charges. <lb/>The LGTT normally guarantees a maximum of 10% of senior debt (20% in exceptional instances) up to a <lb/>maximum of EUR 200 million per project. This support substantially enhances credit quality, thereby encouraging a <lb/>reduction of risk margins applied to senior project loans. This support is available for as much as 5 to 7 years after <lb/>project completion. The European Investment Bank and the European Commission have jointly contributed <lb/>EUR 1 billion in capital, which could support up to EUR 20 billion of senior loans. A recent evaluation of the LGTT <lb/>project (EC, 2014a) shows that while LGTT covers only the traffic risk, investors are looking for more general <lb/>instruments covering broader risks, such as construction and re-financing risks, as well as the traffic risk beyond the <lb/>first 5 to 7 years. <lb/>Improving incentives for greenfield projects <lb/>The National Infrastructure Plan focuses primarily on greenfield investment (investment in new <lb/>infrastructure), but private investors tend to prefer brownfield investment (investment in already existing <lb/>infrastructure). Greenfield projects are perceived as more risky owing to the lack of clarity in bidding <lb/>criteria, delays in the award of projects, pre-construction delays, and delays in financial approvals and <lb/>construction risks (OECD, 2012a). Among private investors, there is the perception that the UK <lb/>government should take more of the risk involved in new infrastructure projects. There is a feeling that <lb/>governments in continental European countries are willing to offer more security to investors than the UK <lb/>(FT, 2013). <lb/>The government could better target the use of the UK Guarantees Scheme by strengthening current <lb/>incentives for private investors supporting greenfield projects. The government introduced this scheme in <lb/>2012 with the Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Act to provide a sovereign-backed guarantee to <lb/>improve access to finance of projects. The government offers support for greenfield or projects in the <lb/>construction phase, but it can also do so for the acquisition, design, conversion, improvement, operation <lb/>and repair of infrastructure assets. The government has a wide discretion over how a guarantee is <lb/>structured and it is provided in return for a fee to be charged at market rates (Allen &amp; Overy, 2013). Up to <lb/>GBP 40 billion in guarantees can be offered. By September 2014, the UK Guarantee Scheme was used for <lb/>six projects (four in the transport and two in the energy sector) for a total of GBP 1.5 billion. <lb/>The government should also explore in depth the option of using capital recycling to finance <lb/>greenfield projects. Capital recycling involves reinvesting the revenues from the privatization of existing <lb/></body>

			<body>brownfield assets, alongside private sector funds, into new greenfield projects. The 2014 update of the <lb/>National Infrastructure Plan mentions capital recycling as a possible financing option but does not provide <lb/>details on how and for which projects this option could be used. Australia is currently considering a more <lb/>intensive use of capital recycling (Office of the National Infrastructure Coordinator, 2013). Its recent <lb/>experience in this area points to the need of effectively communicating how the funds will be used and <lb/>how a project would benefit the broad community. <lb/>Better linking national and local planning systems through the long-term infrastructure strategy would <lb/>improve project implementation and avoid delays in greenfield project delivery. The UK infrastructure <lb/>investment and decision-making process has been historically highly centralised. At the same time, it has <lb/>suffered from the absence of a clear national strategy and planning process. This has contributed to slow <lb/>down project planning and implementation. The UK government is aware of this contradiction and has <lb/>taken step to improve the coherence between the national and local planning systems with the adoption of <lb/>the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects <lb/>(NSIPs) <lb/>The NPPF, introduced in 2012, sets out the government&apos;s planning policies for England. The NPPF&apos;s <lb/>main features are significantly simplified national planning guidelines and decentralised procedures for <lb/>local authorities developing local plans (Chesire et al., 2012). To date, about 80% of local authorities have <lb/>published a Local Plan (HMT, 2013). The government should make sure that project implementations are <lb/>not delayed by the absence of local plans and encourage local authorities who have not yet done so to <lb/>adopt a local plan. <lb/>The NSIP framework institutes a separate planning procedure for large infrastructure projects. Since <lb/>its inception, several projects have been granted approval in this way, for example nuclear power plants <lb/>and wind farms. Such projects, which are subject to specific investment thresholds, do not need to obtain <lb/>separate consents including planning permissions, and their development depends on a final decision of <lb/>relevant secretary of state. <lb/>Stimulating institutions that promote long-term infrastructure investment <lb/>Public financial institutions dedicated to long-term investment can play a key role in the financing of <lb/>infrastructure. In some European countries, national development banks facilitate the provision of <lb/>long-term loans and crowd-in private finance. For instance, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) in <lb/>Germany provides low-interest, long-term loans (20-30 years) for infrastructure projects with fixed interest <lb/>rates and a maximum of three-to-five repayment-free startup years (Weber and Alfen, 2010). In Italy, <lb/>Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) provides either direct financial support for key domestic infrastructure <lb/>projects through loans, or indirect support through investments in infrastructure funds. At the EU level, the <lb/>European Investment Bank raises funds on the capital markets and lends them on favourable terms <lb/>(Subacchi et al., 2014). <lb/>The EU has started new initiatives to promote long-term investment in infrastructure and to <lb/>co-ordinate the activities of European national development banks so as to make them more effective in <lb/>supporting infrastructure investment (Box 6) (Valla et al., 2014). In addition in late 2014, the European <lb/>Commission announced an Investment Pan for Europe (the so-called Juncker&apos;s plan) with the aim of <lb/>unlocking public and private investments of at least EUR 315 billion over three years (2015-17). To <lb/>achieve this target a new European Fund for Strategic Investments is being set up so as to provide risk <lb/>support for long-term investments and ensure increased access to risk financing for small and <lb/>medium-sized enterprises and mid-cap companies (EC, 2014c).The UK government should support these <lb/>initiatives at the European level as the UK along with other European countries should benefit from them. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 6. Recent EU initiatives to support long-term investment in infrastructure <lb/>Recently, European national development banks have joined forces with other leading financial institutions, <lb/>forming the Marguerite Fund. The Marguerite Fund is part of the new financial instruments introduced under the wider <lb/> &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy. The Marguerite Fund is a pan-European equity fund that acts as a catalyst for key investments <lb/>in renewables, energy and transport. It combines a market-based principle of return to investors with the pursuit of <lb/>public policy objectives. Launched in 2010, with the backing of six major European financial institutions (namely the <lb/>European Investment Bank, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Instituto de Crédito Oficial, <lb/>Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, PKO Bank Polski), it makes capital-intensive infrastructure investments. Together with <lb/>the European Commission and other institutional investors the fund has commitments of about EUR 700 million. <lb/>In 2013, the European Commission proposed the introduction of a new fund, the European Long-Term <lb/>Investment Fund (ELTIF), whose implementation is now discussed in the European Parliament. The ELTIF is designed <lb/>to channel investment from retail and institutional investors into companies and projects by offering an appropriate risk <lb/>and return profile. The ELTIF will offer investors the opportunity to make long-term investment into a mixture of <lb/>long-term assets (such as private equity and infrastructure) and transferable securities. <lb/>In 2010, the UK established the Green Investment Bank (GIB) and the authorities should expand its <lb/>operation to emerging low-carbon technologies. The GIB is the first institution devoted to financing <lb/>infrastructure projects promoting green growth. With available government funding of slightly less than <lb/>GBP 4 billion by April 2015, the GIB is investing in innovative, environmentally-friendly areas for which <lb/>there is currently a lack of sufficient support from the market. This includes many infrastructure projects, <lb/>such as offshore wind generation, waste recycling, energy from waste, as well as biomass and energy <lb/>efficiency measures. Since starting operation, the GIB has made 22 transactions totaling about GDP 750 <lb/>million, which have leveraged close to GBP 2 billion of total funding from private investors. In the absence <lb/>of a plan to establish a national infrastructure bank and given the ambitious government&apos;s targets to <lb/>transition towards a green growth model, the government should support – through grants and guarantees – <lb/>not yet commercially viable low-carbon technologies that have the prospect of becoming so, such as <lb/>carbon capture and storage, marine energy, and biofuels for transport. <lb/>Supporting PPPs while transparently recording liabilities and assets arising from them <lb/>The UK has a well-established system of public-private partnerships (PPPs) as it developed the <lb/>Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) framework in the 1990s. By the end of March 2014, almost 730 PFI <lb/>projects were financed through this route, with an aggregate capital value of slightly more than <lb/>GBP 55 billion. Infrastructure sectors (transport and waste) account for less than 25% of the total capital <lb/>costs of all PFI projects (Figure 24, Panel A). The yearly payment from the government to the private <lb/>partner for infrastructure PPP projects currently amounts to about 20% of the corresponding payment for <lb/>all PPP projects and it is poised to fall from the mid-2020s (Figure 24, Panel B). <lb/>The government should seek to increase the use of PFI as a way to manage the construction risks <lb/>more effectively and attract more private investors in infrastructure sectors. The likelihood of costs overrun <lb/>in the construction phase is lower for PFI than for traditional procurement methods (Duffield, 2008; <lb/>Blanc-Brude and Makovsek, 2013). Using PFI in regulated infrastructure sectors for large new projects <lb/>would complement the gains in operational efficiencies that infrastructure-sector regulation generates with <lb/>well-managed construction risks (Makovsek, 2015). The Tideway Tunnel presents a recent example in this <lb/>direction as the government guarantees the construction risks and the new infrastructure, when completed, <lb/>will be transferred to the regulated asset based of the regulated company owning it (Thames Water Utility). <lb/></body>

Infrastructure includes transport and waste. <lb/>Source: HM Treasury (2014), &quot;Private Finance Initiative projects: 2014 summary data&quot;, December. <lb/>Private Finance 2 (PF2) was introduced in 2012 to replace the previous PFI model. This new scheme <lb/>aims at improving the value for money and transparency of PPP projects, including those for infrastructure. <lb/>An assessment of the previous system revealed lack of transparency and optimism bias in project <lb/>preparation (NAO, 2011). Also, there is a perception that private investors have made windfall profits, <lb/>causing concerns about the value for money of projects (HMT, 2012). One of the main innovations of PF2 <lb/>is to involve the government as a minority public equity co-investor in new deals. This reform is likely to <lb/>better align the incentives of the public and private partners, although it also increases taxpayer exposure to <lb/>projects that fail. PF2 also provides stronger incentives to deliver projects on time and budget as, for <lb/>instance, payments to the successful private sector bidder will be made only when the operating asset is <lb/>delivered (HMT, 2012). Recent G20-OECD work on long-term investments in infrastructure suggests the <lb/>need to find a balance between public support to private investors and ensuing moral hazard from the <lb/>private sector (OECD, 2014d). <lb/>The government should make available to investors and the public comparable data about the <lb/>performance of PPP projects. The latest change in the PFI regime was partly motivated by lack of data and <lb/>transparency on the financial and operational performance of PPP projects (HMT, 2012). The government <lb/>has introduced some measures to improve data transparency, notably by requiring the private sector to <lb/>provide actual and expected equity return information for publication. An additional step forward would be <lb/>to make available to the public, quantitative assessments comparing the value for money offered by PPPs <lb/>relative to alternative procurement routes, consistent with the OECD Principles for Public Governance of <lb/>PPPs (OECD, 2014e). A recent joint collaboration between the University College of London and the <lb/>consultancy firm KPMG has produced two assessments of the performance of PPP projects in the <lb/>education and health sectors in the UK (Edkins et al., 2011; Ive et al., 2010). In Australia, the University of <lb/>Melbourne PPP Benchmarking Study is another example of a study comparing the effectiveness of PPP in <lb/>terms of costs and delays with alternative procurement routes in Australia (Duffield, 2008). Such <lb/>information would help to assess the risks hindering private participation in infrastructure (OECD, 2014f), <lb/>hence supporting a more informed decision-making process on the choice of procurement. <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>2014 2018 2022 2026 2030 2034 2038 2042 2046 2050 <lb/>B.

			<body>The government should continue to transparently record assets and contingent liabilities arising from <lb/>PPPs in the Whole Government Accounts (WGA). In 2013, capital liabilities in the WGA related to all PFI <lb/>accounted for a tiny share of gross total liabilities (about 1%), being close to GBP 40 billion (out of which <lb/>GBP 5 billion was recorded in the National Accounts). If all PFI-related investment were undertaken <lb/>through conventional debt finance, public sector net debt would have been around 2 percentage points of <lb/>GDP higher than currently measured (OBR, 2014). <lb/>Better pooling resources of institutional investors <lb/>The government should support initiatives contributing to overcome the problems of investing in <lb/>infrastructure assets caused by the fragmentation of the UK pension system and the lack of necessary <lb/>expertise to evaluate infrastructure investments. The main reason why the UK pension funds have <lb/>historically invested relatively small amounts in infrastructure assets seems to be the lack of in-house <lb/>expertise to invest directly in such assets and a weak capacity to assess their risks. This is related to the <lb/>insufficient size of many institutional investors, which in itself is another impediment to long-term <lb/>infrastructure investment. The UK pension system is heavily fragmented. While there are GBP 1.5 trillion <lb/>in assets under management of the industry, these are unevenly distributed among 7 500 schemes. Of the <lb/>total, 1 000 schemes have assets below GBP 5 million and only 190 of them have more than GBP 1 billion <lb/>(OECD, 2014g). The development of specific skills is therefore essential for changing <lb/>investors&apos; investment habits and increasing participation in less liquid, longer-term assets (Deau, 2011). <lb/>This must be accompanied by actions by governments and stakeholders to pool funds so as to reduce <lb/>fragmentation and improve information collection and financial education campaign (Della <lb/>Croce et al. 2011). <lb/>To overcome these problems, the UK introduced in 2012 the Pensions Infrastructure Platform (PIP). <lb/>The PIP is a collaboration between the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) and the Pension <lb/>Protection Fund (PPF). Its aim is to explore options for pension funds to invest in UK infrastructure on <lb/>more favourable terms than are currently available through traditional fund managers (OECD, 2014g). The <lb/>PIP&apos;s design was modelled on Australia&apos;s IFM Investors, a fund manager owned by 30 Australian <lb/>non-profit pension funds to invest, inter alia, in infrastructure assets. Although the PIP is the result of an <lb/>agreement with the government, the scheme is entirely independent. The platform secured ten founding <lb/>investors but so far results have been below expectation as at October 2014 the fund has secured only <lb/>GBP 350 million, against an initial GBP 2 billion target, and is investing in the &quot; secondary market &quot; rather <lb/>greenfield projects (FT, 2014b). <lb/>Promoting new financial instruments for long-term infrastructure investment <lb/>Because of the dearth of appropriate financing vehicles, only the largest investors have the capacity to <lb/>directly fund infrastructure projects (Della Croce and Yermo, 2013). Collective investment vehicles are <lb/>available, such as infrastructure funds, but because of high fees and extensive leverage these have become <lb/>less popular since the financial crisis. <lb/>The large majority of infrastructure projects is debt-financed (the world average is around 85%) and <lb/>the commercial banks have been the key providers. During the crisis banks scaled back infrastructure <lb/>loans, raised interest rates and shifted assets to shorter maturities. Standard and Poor&apos;s has estimated that <lb/>between 2011 and 2012 the fall in project finance loans was in the range of 10-30%. More recently, banks <lb/>have been reporting stronger capacity to provide longer-term lending for infrastructure and the cost of <lb/>credit has fallen. <lb/>Developing project bonds (issued by one company or jointly by several companies) to finance specific <lb/>infrastructure projects could partly substitute for reduced bank finance. Project bonds are the main source <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body>of infrastructure finance other than bank debt and account for 10% of the global private debt funding <lb/>(Inderset, 2013). These instruments service the borrowed capital through the project&apos;s revenue and have <lb/>several advantages for financial investors, including better identification of risks and a competitive rate of <lb/>return. Recent transactions for long-dated project bonds offered yields of between 5% and 6.5%. This is <lb/>higher than the 4-5% yields available on sovereign bonds with equivalent ratings. In the UK, infrastructure <lb/>bonds guaranteed by monoline insurance companies were relatively common in PPPs before the financial <lb/>crisis (EPEC, 2012). However, the demise of monoline insurance companies in the wake of the crisis has <lb/>reduced the attractiveness of project bonds among investors. <lb/>The UK government could work in partnership with national and European financial institutions to <lb/>support infrastructure project bonds by developing an insurance market for them. The EU is promoting a <lb/>more intensive use infrastructure bonds (Box 7). Moreover, the UK government could consider granting a <lb/>tax exemption or a reduced tax rate to raise incentives for the development of project bonds issued by <lb/>corporations. Such an intervention would have to be justified by positive externalities infrastructure <lb/>provides and the market failures in properly assessing the risk involved in long-term infrastructure projects. <lb/>The United States has successfully adopted this approach to develop a dynamic municipal bond market to <lb/>finance infrastructure projects while the Australian government offered tax reliefs on infrastructure bonds <lb/>in the 1990s, which however were later repealed (Abelson, 2005). <lb/>Box 7. The EU 2020 Project Bond Initiative <lb/>The EU 2020 Project Bond Initiative, together with the Loan Guarantee for TEN Transport and the Marguerite <lb/>Fund, is part of the new financial instruments foreseen under the proposed &quot; Connecting Europe Facility &quot; (CEF), which <lb/>is part of the wider &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy. The aim of the CEF is to provide a longer-term financial framework <lb/>ensuring that energy, transport and telecommunications projects are developed and implemented in a timely and <lb/>effective manner. The Project Bond initiative is designed to enable eligible infrastructure projects promoters, usually <lb/>public-private partnerships (PPP), to attract additional private finance from institutional investors such as insurance <lb/>companies and pension funds. This is planned to be achieved by providing credit enhancement to the infrastructure <lb/>promoters, whose debt will effectively be divided into two tranches, senior and subordinated. <lb/>The subordinated debt or Project Bond Credit Enhancement (PBCE) can take the form of a loan from the <lb/>European Investment Bank given to the promoter at the outset. It may also take the form of a contingent credit line <lb/>which can be drawn upon if the revenues generated by the project are not sufficient to ensure senior debt service. The <lb/>PBCE underwrites the senior debt and therefore improves its credit quality by allowing a rating uplift. <lb/>The Greater Gabbard bond issue (2013) was the first in the United Kingdom to use the European Investment <lb/>Bank&apos;s (EIB) credit enhancement initiative. The EIB provided a GBP 45 million guarantee of a total investment of <lb/>GBP 300 million, which helped to pull the rating of the issued bonds up by one notch to A3 by Moody&apos;s. UK-based fund <lb/>managers, mostly on behalf of institutional investors took nearly 80% of the bonds, while insurers and pension funds <lb/>took the remaining. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 8. Main policy recommendations to boost infrastructure provision <lb/>Strengthening infrastructure strategy and planning <lb/> Continue to build on the progress made with the National Infrastructure Plan to further enhance long-term <lb/>infrastructure strategy and planning. <lb/> Continue to encourage the development by local authorities of up-to-date local plans to make sure <lb/>infrastructure provision is not delayed. <lb/>Policies to ensure sound infrastructure in specific sectors <lb/> Improve the use of roads by introducing user-paid tolls. <lb/> Ensure the arms-length responsibility for awarding rail franchises. <lb/> Take a final decision on how to tackle airport congestion in the South East, after carefully considering the <lb/>recommendation of the Airports Commission, while maintaining strong competitive pressures among <lb/>airports. <lb/> Evaluate the interaction of the Electricity Market Reform with existing policies to promote renewable <lb/>energies. <lb/> Ensure competitive auctions are held to award subsidies for expanding access to digital services in rural <lb/>areas. <lb/>Improving the financing of infrastructure <lb/> Increase the number of ready-to-finance projects to attract private investors. <lb/> Promote the financing of infrastructure by supporting the development of new financial market instruments, <lb/>such as project bonds, and consider granting tax reliefs if needed. <lb/> Develop further the use of public-private partnerships (PPP) and public guarantees to attract private <lb/>investment into infrastructure and record the associated assets and liabilities in the government fiscal <lb/>accounts. Enhance the provision to investors and the public of comparable data about public guarantees <lb/>and the financial and operational performance of PPP projects. <lb/> Strengthen the use of the UK Guarantee Scheme to support greenfield infrastructure projects. Explore in <lb/>depth the option of using capital recycling to finance greenfield projects and clarify for which projects it could <lb/>be used. <lb/> Strengthen the Green Investment Bank and other targeted financial aids to further support the <lb/>implementation of not yet commercially viable low-carbon technologies that have the prospect of becoming <lb/>so in the foreseeable future. <lb/> Support the Pension Infrastructure Platform to overcome the problems caused by the fragmentation of the <lb/>UK pension system and to develop private sector expertise in direct. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2015)62 <lb/></body>
