			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>Passenger vehicles are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and prodigious consumers of <lb/>petroleum, making their fuel economy an important focus of energy policy. Whether or not the market <lb/>for fuel economy functions efficiently has important implications for both the type and intensity of <lb/>energy and environmental policies for motor vehicles. There are undoubtedly imperfections in the <lb/>market for fuel economy but their consequences are difficult to quantify. The evidence from <lb/>econometric studies, mostly from the US, is reviewed and shown to vary widely, providing evidence <lb/>for both significant under-and over-valuation and everything in between. Market research is scarce, <lb/>but indicates that the rational economic model, in general, does not appear to be used by consumers <lb/>when comparing the fuel economy of new vehicles. Some recent studies have stressed the role of <lb/>uncertainty and risk or loss aversion in consumers&apos; decision making. Uncertainty plus loss aversion <lb/>appears to be a reasonable theoretical model of consumers&apos; evaluation of fuel economy, with profound <lb/>implications for manufacturers&apos; technology and design decisions. The theory implies that markets will <lb/>substantially undervalue fuel economy relative to its expected present value. It also has potentially <lb/>important implications for welfare analysis of alternative policy instruments. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>How markets determine the energy efficiency of new vehicles not only has important <lb/>consequences for the quantity of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and petroleum consumption, but it is <lb/>also the most important factor in the choice of mitigation policies. Globally, light-duty vehicles <lb/>account for about 12% of energy-related CO 2 emissions and about one-third of petroleum use (IEA, <lb/>2009a). The importance of light-duty vehicles is growing rapidly in the world&apos;s emerging economies. <lb/>The International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates a tripling of light-duty vehicle sales and stocks by <lb/>2050 over 2005 levels under business as usual. As a consequence, passenger car fuel economy has <lb/>been a major focus of national energy policies for decades. Governments from China, to Australia, <lb/>Japan, the EU, Canada and the US have adopted fuel economy or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions <lb/>standards either in place of or in combination with motor fuel taxes as a means of reducing vehicle <lb/>fuel consumption and emissions below what would otherwise be achieved by market forces alone <lb/>(Onoda, 2007). <lb/>Whether the market for automotive fuel economy is efficient and fully accounts for the expected, <lb/>discounted present value of fuel savings of the lifetime of new vehicles, or whether it systematically <lb/>undervalues fuel economy improvement is a central question for energy and environmental policy for <lb/>motor vehicles. If markets systematically undervalue fuel economy, market-determined levels of fuel <lb/></body>

			<body>consumption (l/100km) and emissions (g/km) will be too high and will not respond efficiently to price <lb/>signals. In addition, there would likely be a systematic underinvestment in research and development <lb/>of energy efficient technologies. <lb/>There will be important implications for both the choice of policy instrument and its intensity. <lb/>For example, Fischer et al. (2007) showed that if US consumers count only the first three years of fuel <lb/>savings, tightening fuel economy standards would increase social welfare based on private costs and <lb/>benefits alone. On the other hand, if consumers fully valued the full lifetime expected value of fuel <lb/>savings, the same level of fuel economy standards would decrease social welfare. The efficiency of <lb/>the market for fuel economy is especially important in countries with relatively low fuel taxes and a <lb/>large vehicle parc, such as China and the US. <lb/>When matters as serious as global climate change are at stake, it is not sufficient to rely on <lb/>textbook models of efficient markets for policy assessment. Policy analysis must be based on how <lb/>real world markets actually function. Costs and benefits may vary widely depending on how markets <lb/>really function. Given this, it is disappointing that so little is known about how real world markets for <lb/>energy efficiency in durable consumer goods actually work. It is no exaggeration to say that hundreds <lb/>of billions of dollars are at stake. To say that more research is warranted is an understatement. <lb/>2. FUEL ECONOMY AND THE RATIONAL ECONOMIC CONSUMER <lb/> &quot; There is no longer any doubt about the weight of the scientific evidence; the expected-utility <lb/>model of economic and political decision making is not sustainable empirically. From the laboratory <lb/>comes failure after failure of rational expected utility to account for human behavior. &quot; (Jones, 1999, <lb/>p. 297) <lb/>Despite the evident failures of expected utility theory, it is the preferred premise of many policy <lb/>analysts when it comes to automotive fuel economy. The utility-maximizing rational consumer has <lb/>fixed preferences, possesses all complete and accurate information about all relevant alternatives, and <lb/>has all the cognitive skills necessary to evaluate the alternatives. These are strict requirements indeed, <lb/>and even advocates of the rational consumer model claim only that it is approximated in reality. <lb/>The rational economic consumer considers fuel savings over the full lifetime of a vehicle, <lb/>discounting future fuel savings to present value. This requires the consumer to know how long the <lb/>vehicle will remain in operation (L), the distances to be traveled in each future year (M(t)), the <lb/>reduction ( ) in the rate of fuel consumption (G), and the future price of fuel. A formula for <lb/>continuous discounting of future fuel savings is presented below as equation 1. If the price of fuel can <lb/>be assumed to be constant over time (P t = P o ), the discounting formula simplifies, as shown in the <lb/>second half of equation 1. In general, the information consumers will have on fuel consumption will <lb/>be a test cycle number. Thus, the consumer must also estimate the fuel economy that will be achieved <lb/>in real world driving based on the official estimate. Finally, the consumer must know how to make a <lb/>discounted present value calculation, or must know how to obtain one. The importance of <lb/>uncertainties in all the factual information required to calculate the present value of fuel savings will <lb/>be taken up below, as will the ability or willingness of consumers to make such calculations. <lb/></body>

Market &quot; Failures &quot; or Imperfections <lb/>The literature on consumer evaluation of energy efficiency improvements to energy using durable <lb/>goods has, until recently, focused on market imperfections and discount rates. Energy economists <lb/>have indentified several forms of market failure 1 to explain the high discount rates consumers appear <lb/>to apply to future energy savings (e.g., Howarth and Sanstad, 1995; ACEEE, 2007; Train, 1985): <lb/>1. Principal Agent Conflicts <lb/>2. Information Asymmetry <lb/>3. Imperfect Information <lb/>4. Transaction Costs <lb/>5. Bounded Rationality <lb/>6. Lack of Skills to Perform Necessary Calculations <lb/>7. External Costs <lb/>8. Consumer Myopia <lb/>2.1.1. Principal Agent Conflicts <lb/>In the market for light-duty vehicles, consumers themselves choose directly among existing <lb/>makes and models. However, manufacturers act as consumers&apos; agents in making the technology and <lb/>design decisions that determine a vehicle&apos;s energy efficiency. They decide how much cost should be <lb/>incurred in adding energy efficient technologies. With exceptions (such as diesel and hybrid vehicles) <lb/>consumers are not aware of the fuel economy and cost trade-offs available to manufacturers. One <lb/>consequence of this is that consumers&apos; perceptions of fuel economy are based on the trade-offs they <lb/>observe in the range of choices available at any given time. The manufacturers, on the other hand, are <lb/>aware of the &quot; fuel economy supply curve &quot; defined by technology and decide, on behalf of consumers <lb/>how much technology to adopt and for what purpose (fuel economy, performance, size, mass or <lb/>accessories). The question is whether there is any reason for manufacturers to supply less fuel <lb/>economy than would be optimal based on its expected value to the consumer. We will return to this <lb/>subject below, but simply note here that manufacturers have repeatedly stated that consumers will pay, <lb/>in increased vehicle price, for only 2-4 years of fuel savings. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.1.2. Information Asymmetry <lb/>It follows from the principal agent discussion that manufacturers know more about energy <lb/>efficient technology and its cost than do consumers. In theory, a market failure could result if some <lb/>manufacturers under-supply fuel economy, yet claim that their vehicles are just as efficient as their <lb/>higher-priced competitors&apos; vehicles. In general, one would expect widespread fuel economy labeling <lb/>to make such claims difficult. Still, this can be observed to a limited degree in the United States when <lb/>manufacturers report only their vehicles&apos; &quot; highway &quot; fuel economy ratings in television advertising. <lb/>2.1.3. Imperfect Information <lb/>With fuel economy ratings widely available, it might at first appear that imperfect information <lb/>could not be a significant problem. However, differences between official ratings and the fuel <lb/>economy motorists experience on the road can be very large (Greene et al., 2006). Figure 1 plots fuel <lb/>economy estimates provided by individuals to the U.S. government&apos;s website www.fueleconomy.gov <lb/>versus the corresponding official EPA estimates. The variance around the official ratings is on the <lb/>order of +/-33%. Factors such as driving style, traffic environment, temperature and terrain (as well <lb/>as estimation errors) lead to substantial uncertainty about the fuel economy any given consumer will <lb/>actually achieve. However, the official estimates do not appear to be seriously biased. While <lb/>information about fuel economy is abundant, in most cases there is little information about its price. <lb/>Except where fuel economy is linked to a priced vehicle attribute, such as a larger engine, no explicit <lb/>information about its cost is generally provided. In such cases, consumers must infer the cost of fuel <lb/>economy by comparing the multiple attributes of different vehicles, an exceedingly complex task. The <lb/>chief problem with available fuel economy information therefore appears to be uncertainty, which can <lb/>lead loss-averse consumers to undervalue fuel economy improvements. This subject will be discussed <lb/>in greater detail below. <lb/>2.1.4. Transaction Costs do not appear to be a significant problem for the market for fuel economy. <lb/>2.1.5. Bounded Rationality <lb/>The concept of bounded rationality recognizes that consumers face limitations in terms of the <lb/>information available to them, their cognitive abilities, and the time available to make decisions. Of <lb/>these three, cognitive limitations seem the most relevant to fuel economy and vehicle choice. <lb/>Choosing among the thousand or so makes, models and engine/transmission combinations available is <lb/>a complex task. Vehicles are bundles of multiple attributes, e.g., price, size, materials, workmanship, <lb/>styling, accessory features, fuel economy, warranty, acceleration, comfort, safety, reliability, and <lb/>more. Utility optimization requires that all these attributes be simultaneously compared and traded-<lb/>off, a complex task. Consumers may instead optimize on the three or four attributes of greatest <lb/>importance and satisfice the rest. Especially in countries with low energy prices, this could lead to <lb/>undervaluing fuel economy. In the United States, for example, fuel economy rarely ranks among <lb/>consumers&apos; top five concerns when purchasing an automobile. Where fuel prices are high enough to <lb/>make fuel economy one of new car buyers&apos; top few concerns, decision making may be closer to the <lb/>rational, utility maximizing model. Unfortunately, little research has been done on this subject. <lb/>2.1.6. Lack of Skills to Perform Necessary Calculations <lb/>Calculation of the present value of fuel economy improvements requires mathematical skills <lb/>many consumers do not posses. They could, however, have others make such calculations for them, <lb/>for example via an internet site. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.1.7. External Costs <lb/>Use of petroleum by motor vehicles produces several important externalities, greenhouse gas <lb/>emissions, local air pollution, oil dependence. Some also count externalities associated with motor <lb/>vehicle use, such as traffic congestion and safety (e.g., Parry and Small, 2005). These externalities, <lb/>however are not directly linked to fuel use or fuel economy. In some countries motor fuel taxes may <lb/>exceed the external costs of motor fuel use, while in others they are probably less. <lb/>2.1.8. Consumer Myopia <lb/>In the expected utility maximizing framework, shortsightedness implies some form of market <lb/>failure, unless it reflects risk aversion. Shortsightedness might arise from cognitive limitations, or <lb/>simply irrationality. An explanation offered more in the popular media than in scholarly studies is that <lb/>consumers count fuel savings only for the period over which they intend to own a vehicle. This begs <lb/>the question of why the used car market would not be willing to pay for better fuel economy. Clearly, <lb/>for the new vehicle market to operate efficiently, the used vehicle market must also. Since most <lb/>vehicles change ownership during their lifetimes, new car buyers must believe that used car markets <lb/>will fully value the remaining fuel savings. There is little empirical information to confirm or refute <lb/>that used car markets are efficient. <lb/>For comparison with full lifetime discounting (equation 1), the equation for a simple 3-year <lb/>payback is shown in equation 2. In its study of the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, <lb/>the US National Research Council (NRC, 2002) calculated &quot; cost-efficient &quot; fuel economy <lb/>improvements using both methods. <lb/>Equation 2. Simple 3-year Payback <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>3 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>3 <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/>M <lb/>P <lb/>V <lb/>The ratio of equation (1) to equation (2) is the following. <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>L <lb/>r <lb/>e <lb/>r <lb/>For parameter values, = 0.04, r = 0.07, and L=14, the ratio of full lifetime discounted fuel <lb/>savings to a simple three year accumulation is approximately 2.7. A consumer with these values for <lb/>the rate of decrease in vehicle use with age, discount rate, and vehicle lifetime, who used a simple <lb/>three-year payback to value future fuel savings would underestimate their lifetime discounted present <lb/>value by a factor of 2.7. Although these equations are useful for analytical purposes, there are reasons <lb/>to doubt that any significant number of consumers make such calculations, or have them done for <lb/>them. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2. Uncertainty and Risk Aversion: Expected Utility Maximization <lb/>Of course, every variable in the lifetime discounted present value calculation is subject to some <lb/>degree of uncertainty. Uncertainty and risk can be introduced into the utility maximizing framework <lb/>by describing each variable as a probability distribution. This requires even more information about <lb/>future states of the world but, in theory at least, it is possible. Consumers are then assumed to <lb/>maximize expected utility. This allows risk aversion to be incorporated into the expected utility <lb/>maximizing model, since risk aversion is a preference. As such, it is a matter of consumer sovereignty <lb/>rather than irrational behavior. <lb/>Recent analyses have identified uncertainty and risk aversion as at least as logical an explanation <lb/>for apparently high discount rates in the expected utility maximizing model. Hassett and Metcalfe <lb/>(1993) and (Diederen et al., 2003) demonstrated that uncertainty about future energy prices would lead <lb/>to underinvestment in energy efficiency if consumers are risk averse. However, energy prices are not <lb/>the only source of uncertainty about future energy savings. The performance of energy using durable <lb/>goods, such as motor vehicles, may be even more important (Bjornstad and McKee, 2006). Fuel <lb/>economy estimates provided by individual motorists to the U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s website <lb/>www.fueleconomy.gov show very substantial variability around the government&apos;s official fuel <lb/>economy estimates (Figure 1). While some of this variance represents measurement error rather than <lb/>genuine differences in realized fuel economy, a large fraction probably represents differences in <lb/>driving style, traffic conditions, types of trips, and their environment. In either case, if motorists <lb/>perceive great uncertainty about the fuel economy they will actually achieve, this could have a <lb/>profound effect on how they value fuel economy, as will be shown below. <lb/>Figure 1. Motorist&apos; Fuel Economy Estimates v. Official Estimates <lb/>(www.fueleconomy.gov) <lb/></body>

			<body>Using expected utility maximization with risk aversion Delucchi (2007) showed that risk averse <lb/>new car buyers would appear to have high discount rates for fuel economy relative to a risk neutral <lb/>consumer. Rather than using explicit probability distributions for each parameter, Delucchi assumed <lb/>that consumers would in all cases make &quot; conservative &quot; assumptions about the price of fuel, vehicle <lb/>lifetime, miles driven and other key variables. He found that risk averse consumers with a discount <lb/>rate of 5.5% for investments without risk would appear to have a discount rate of 19% taking risk into <lb/>account and making &quot; conservative &quot; assumptions about likely outcomes. Delucchi concludes the <lb/>following: <lb/> &quot; Thus, the high implicit discount rate that consumers appear to apply to fuel-economy purchase <lb/>decisions is best understood not as an explicit expectation of a very high rate of return on investment <lb/>foregone by spending money on fuel economy, but rather as the implicit equivalent of a series of <lb/>conservative assumptions about fuel prices, fuel economy improvement, resale value, and so on, <lb/>combined with an expectation of a normal rate of return on foregone investments. &quot; (Delucchi, 2007, <lb/>pp. 16-17) <lb/>3. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF CONSUMERS&apos; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY <lb/>FOR FUEL ECONOMY <lb/>Evidence from the econometric literature concerning consumers&apos; willingness to pay for fuel <lb/>economy based on the expected utility-maximizing model is contradictory and therefore inconclusive. <lb/>Most available estimates are derived from random utility models of consumers&apos; choice of vehicle. The <lb/>estimates are highly variable, ranging from significant undervaluing to significant overvaluing of fuel <lb/>economy. A handful of studies using hedonic price models and other methods are equally conflicting. <lb/>In some cases, flaws in model formulation or estimation methods can be identified, but in most cases <lb/>there is no obvious explanation for the extreme differences among studies. <lb/>3.1. Econometric Estimates <lb/>Implicit consumer discount rates were estimated by Greene (1983) based on eight early <lb/>multinomial logit choice models. In some models discount rates were a function of consumer income, <lb/>in others discount rates were random variables. The estimates ranged from 0% to 73%, setting aside <lb/>the one study with the most extreme results. Many estimates are below 10% but an equally large <lb/>number are over 20% per year (Table 1.). Most fall between 4% and 40%. Some of the variation may <lb/>be explained by systematic variation in discount rates with income. For those models in which <lb/>discount rates vary with income, higher income groups tend to show lower discount rates. To a large <lb/>degree this relationship is dictated by the modeler&apos;s decision to represent vehicle price by price <lb/>divided by income. The sensitivity of discount rates to income varies widely across the models, <lb/>however. <lb/></body>

These estimates <lb/>vary widely, from a low of 0-2% for two vehicle households in the Sherman study to 41% in the study <lb/>by Beggs and Cardell. &quot; (Train, 1985, p. 1249) <lb/>The pattern of wide variation in discount rates and very high apparent discount rates at the upper <lb/>end of the range is common not only to automobiles but to many other consumer choices of energy <lb/>using equipment. Train summarized his findings on discount rates for all energy-related consumer <lb/>purchases as follows. <lb/> &quot; The range of estimated average discount rates found in previous studies is listed below by the <lb/>type of choice in which the discount rate is implicit. Measures to improve the thermal integrity of <lb/>dwellings: 10-32%; space heating system and fuel type: 4.4-36%; air conditioning: 3.2-29%; <lb/>refrigerators: 39-100%; other appliances (water heating, cooking, food freezing) 18-67%; <lb/>automobiles: 2-41%; and unspecified actions: 3.7-22%. &quot; (Train, 1985, p. 1250). <lb/>Train concluded: &quot; Clearly this is an area of research requiring considerably more attention. &quot; <lb/>(Train, 1985, p. 1252). <lb/>Studies of consumers&apos; willingness to pay for improved fuel economy, conducted over the past <lb/>20 years, were reviewed by Greene (2010).

			<body>consumers. Some models were estimated using aggregate sales data while others were based on <lb/>surveys. Studies estimating hedonic price models and other methods were also included. Greene <lb/>summarized the results in terms of consumers willingness to pay for fuel economy improvement as a <lb/>percent of the full-lifetime discounted present value of fuel economy using either each study&apos;s <lb/>reported vehicle usage and expected lifetime, or standard assumptions published by the U.S. <lb/>Department of Transportation. <lb/>The more recent studies exhibit at least as wide a range of estimates as the earlier surveys by <lb/>Greene (1983) and Train (1985): from &lt;1% to 400% of the expected present value. In the vast <lb/>majority of studies, there was no evident explanation for the wide differences among the estimates. <lb/>The evidence from the empirical literature, 25 years after the early summaries by Greene and Train, <lb/>remains contradictory and inconclusive. <lb/>Table 2.

The <lb/>sophistication of the models has advanced significantly, but hard statistical problems remain. Vehicle <lb/>choice is a complex, multidimensional problem, further complicated by the fact that consumers&apos; <lb/>preferences are heterogenous. In general, it is not possible to define, let alone accurately measure all <lb/>the relevant variables. For example, safety may include measures of frontal impact for driver and <lb/>passenger, side impacts, and rollover propensity, at least. Performance may include 0-50km, <lb/>50-100km, and even &gt; 100 km/hr acceleration times, as well as a variety of handling measures. <lb/>Reliability, comfort and luxury are also not easily measured, not to mention prestige and style.

For estimates <lb/>based on historical data, there is also the problem of disentangling the effects of fuel economy <lb/>standards from consumers&apos; preferences.

			<body>the available literature does not appear to provide a reasonable consensus, nor does it help to resolve <lb/>the question of whether consumers under-or over-value fuel economy improvements. In anything, it <lb/>casts doubt on the validity of the model of the expected utility maximizing consumer. <lb/>3.2. Evidence from Surveys and Focus Groups <lb/>Evidence from surveys, focus groups and anthropologic research in the US indicates that the <lb/>rational economic model of trading off cost or other vehicle attributes for the discounted present value <lb/>of expected fuel savings is rarely used by car buyers in their real world decision making. The most <lb/>useful insights come from in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 57 households in California <lb/>conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis (Turrentine and Kurani, 2007). <lb/>Without prompting respondents about their views on fuel economy, the researchers asked for a <lb/>description of each household&apos;s entire vehicle ownership history, and their reasons for acquiring and <lb/>disposing of each vehicle. Few respondents mentioned fuel economy as a factor. <lb/>In the final stage of the interviews, the researchers revealed their interest in fuel economy, <lb/>ultimately asking respondents about their willingness to pay for a vehicle with a 50% increase in fuel <lb/>economy. The answers reveal an absence of quantitative assessment. <lb/> &quot; In eight interviews in which we did ask the question, the household could not or would not offer <lb/>a value. Ten other households offered a range, e.d., &apos;$2000 to $4000&apos; or &apos;$5000 to $7000.&apos; <lb/>Sometimes this range conveyed obvious uncertainty; sometimes these ranges represented <lb/>disagreement between household members who were unable to agree on an amount in the course of <lb/>the interview. Among households who offered specific dollar amounts (or answers in a range less <lb/>than $1000), values ranged between zero and $10,000. Even excluding the eight households from <lb/>whom we did not solicit a value, half the households are unable or unwilling to offer a numeric <lb/>answer. &quot; (Turrentine and Kurani, 2007, p. 1219) <lb/>These results bear a striking similarity to the econometric estimates described above. Both <lb/>results are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be no single underlying model used by <lb/>consumers to evaluate fuel economy. <lb/> &quot; We found no household that analyzed their fuel costs in a systematic way in their automobile or <lb/>gasoline purchases….One effect of this lack of knowledge and information is that when consumers buy <lb/>a vehicle, they do not have the basic building blocks of knowledge assumed by the model of <lb/>economically rational decision-making, and they make large errors estimating gasoline costs and <lb/>savings over time. &quot; (Turrentine and Kurani, 2007, p. 1213) <lb/>However, the lack of a rigorous model for evaluating fuel economy implies neither that <lb/>consumers will undervalue nor overvalue fuel economy. <lb/>The evidence from automobile manufacturers is anecdotal but revealing. The US National <lb/>Research Council report on the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (NRC, 2002) made <lb/>estimates of cost-effective fuel economy levels based on two alternative assumptions: 1) present value <lb/>of discounted, expected future fuel savings and, 2) a simple 3-year payback rule of thumb. As a <lb/>member of that committee, the author can report that the latter assumption was based on statements <lb/>made to the committee by several manufacturers. Manufacturers rules of thumb ranged from 2-4 year <lb/>simple paybacks to 3-year paybacks, to 80,000 km paybacks (the average usage of a new car in the US <lb/></body>

When asked the source of this information, manufacturers&apos; <lb/>representatives invariably cited proprietary market research. <lb/>A nationwide random sample survey of 1,000 households for the US Department of Energy asked <lb/>half of the respondents how much more they would be willing to pay for a vehicle that saved them <lb/>$400 per year in fuel costs (Opinion Research Corp., 2004). The other half of the respondents were <lb/>asked how much annual fuel savings they would require in order to be willing to pay an additional <lb/>$1,200 for a new vehicle.

			<body>4. UNCERTAINTY AND LOSS AVERSION: CONTEXT DEPENDENT <lb/>PREFERENCES <lb/>Probably the most well established principle of behavioral economics is that when faced with <lb/>uncertainty consumers 1) weigh potential losses far more than potential gains and, 2) exaggerate the <lb/>probability of loss (Della Vigna, 2009). In contrast to the concept of risk aversion, the theory of loss <lb/>aversion (or prospect theory) is premised on context dependent utility (Tversky and Simonson, 1993). <lb/>Which theory is more correct has important implications for the welfare analysis of policies such as <lb/>fuel economy standards. Risk aversion assumes that consumers&apos; preferences are fixed and that one of <lb/>their preferences is to avoid situations in which losses are likely. Thus, if consumers are forced to <lb/>accept risky bets, there is a real and measurable loss of utility that does not change if the context of the <lb/>bet is changed nor does it change once the bet has been resolved. This led Arrow and Lind (1970) to <lb/>conclude that governments should impose risky investments on the public only when the government <lb/>also insured individuals against the consequences of losses. Prospect theory asserts that utility is <lb/>context dependent, meaning that a consumer&apos;s evaluation of the utility of a risky bet could be different <lb/>ex post and ex ante. <lb/>Under risk aversion, if consumers would reject a 50/50 bet of win $150/lose $100, then even if <lb/>after the bet half of the consumers won $150 and half lost $100 for an average net gain per consumer <lb/>of $25, there would be a net loss of utility, considering the entire process. Prospect theory does not <lb/>answer this question definitively but allows the possibility that, on average, consumers might consider <lb/>themselves better off after the bet. <lb/>With respect to new cars, a further complication is that decisions about the technological content <lb/>and design of vehicles are not made by consumers but by manufacturers acting as consumers&apos; agents. <lb/>It has already been asserted above that manufacturers state that consumers think in terms of short <lb/>payback periods. However, the detailed interviews of households in California indicate that <lb/>consumers typically do not think in terms of payback periods or any quantitative assessment of fuel <lb/>savings and costs, but rather rely on a variety of different decision rules. As will be shown below, the <lb/>behavior of a loss averse consumer approximates that of a consumer with a very short payback period. <lb/>Greene et al. (2009a) considered the implications of loss aversion and uncertainty for <lb/>manufacturers&apos; decisions about the use of technology to increase fuel economy. The authors <lb/>quantified consumers uncertainty about the future value of fuel savings by constructing probability <lb/>distributions of vehicle use, lifetime, gasoline prices, real-world versus official test fuel economy <lb/>estimates, and the cost of improved fuel economy. Key parameters of their probability distributions <lb/>are shown in table 3. <lb/></body>

Figure 3 illustrates this using data from a recent fuel economy study by <lb/>the U.S. National Research Council (2002). The solid black line shows the net present value of fuel <lb/>savings calculated using the assumptions shown in the graph. The dot and dash line shows the <lb/>committee&apos;s &quot; average &quot; estimates of the cost (in retail price equivalent) of increasing fuel economy (in <lb/>miles per gallon). The committee also provided high and low cost estimates. The rational utility <lb/>maximizing consumer is interested in the difference between the two, the net present value of <lb/>increased fuel economy, illustrated by the &quot; Xed &quot; line. Note that this function is relatively flat near its <lb/>optimum, varying by only about $100 over a range of 6-7 miles per gallon. The optimum value is <lb/>approximately 36 miles per gallon (6.5 l/100km), a 25% increase over the base level of 28 miles per <lb/>gallon (8.4 l/100km). <lb/>If the parameters in table 3 are used to describe uncertainty about the value of future fuel savings, <lb/>the value of increasing fuel economy to, say 35 MPG (6.7 l/100km) becomes not a certain value but a <lb/>probability distribution. This is illustrated in Figure 4, in which the expected value of $405 is close to <lb/>the certain value of just over $500, but it is also possible to lose up to $3,000 or gain up to $4,500. <lb/>Incorporating uncertainty transforms the sure thing into a risky bet. Does this change the way <lb/>consumers would evaluate the option to improve fuel economy? According to the theory of loss <lb/>aversion, widely regarded as the most firmly established principle of behavioral economics, the <lb/>answer is yes, it changes things profoundly. <lb/></body>

			<body>Behavioral economics has discovered several types of situations in which consumers&apos; choices are <lb/>not consistent with utility maximization. One of these is loss aversion, in which consumers define <lb/>gains and losses relative to their status quo, weight losses approximately twice as much as gains, and <lb/>exaggerate the probability of loss (DellaVigna, 2009; Gal, 2006; Tversky, Knetsch and Thaler, 1991). <lb/>A typical loss aversion function estimated by Tversky and Khaneman (1992) is the following <lb/>equation, illustrated in Figure 5: <lb/>0 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>0 <lb/>x <lb/>if <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>V <lb/>x <lb/>if <lb/>x <lb/>(3) <lb/>The variable x is the payoff of a risky choice and V is its utility or perceived value to the <lb/>consumer. Note that this implies that V is not necessarily denominated in dollars, even when x is. <lb/>Typical values for the loss aversion function coefficients are λ = 2.25, α = β = 0.88 (Bernatzi and <lb/>Thaler, 1995). The above loss-aversion function is illustrated in figure 4. <lb/>Figure 5.

The mean of <lb/>this distribution is not +$405 but -32 (again, although the axis of Figure 6 is labeled in $, the units are <lb/>not the same as in Figure 4). In this example, it is not assumed that consumers have exaggerated the <lb/>probability of loss, although that is generally the case. Clearly that would further bias the perceived <lb/>value of the risky bet toward loss. <lb/></body>

However, <lb/>to a typical loss averse consumer, the improved fuel economy appears not as a gain but as a loss. If <lb/>manufacturers correctly understand consumers&apos; willingness to pay for fuel economy improvements, <lb/>they would decline to adopt the technologies necessary to raise fuel economy to 35 MPG <lb/>(6.7 l/100km). In fact, in the above example, there is no increase in fuel economy that gives a positive <lb/>return to the loss averse consumer. This result is almost identical to the simple rule of thumb that <lb/>consumers will pay for only 3 years of fuel savings. As illustrated in Figure 7, the three year payback <lb/>rule, applied to the same cost and present value calculations as in Figure 3, results in a nearly zero net <lb/>value for even small fuel economy improvements. <lb/>Returning to the fact that it is manufacturers who act as consumers&apos; agents in deciding which fuel <lb/>economy technologies to adopt and how to design vehicles for fuel economy, the theory of uncertainty <lb/>and loss aversion appears to be entirely consistent with their observations that consumers are willing <lb/>to pay for only 2-4 years worth of a potential fuel economy improvement. Even if the characterization <lb/>of consumers&apos; decision rule as a simple payback calculation is incorrect, as Turrentine and Kurani&apos;s <lb/>(2007) research certainly suggests it is, it is nevertheless a useful rule of thumb in that it leads to the <lb/>same conclusion. <lb/>Even if fuel prices are increased, uncertainty and loss aversion result in an undervaluing of fuel <lb/>economy (Greene, 2010). If fuel prices were doubled, some fuel economy improvement would appear <lb/>cost effective, even to the loss averse consumer. Manufacturers would presumably then increase fuel <lb/>economy up to the level for which the loss averse consumer was willing to pay. But due to the <lb/>increasing slope of the fuel economy cost curve, as fuel economy is increased further increases <lb/>become more costly. Once fuel economy has been increased to the level for which the consumer is <lb/>willing to pay, there is once again a significant potential for loss, which the consumer will overweight <lb/>relative to the potential for gain. Thus, even in countries with relatively high fuel prices, loss aversion <lb/></body>

			<body>5. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS <lb/>The value car buyers assign to increased fuel economy has important implications for policies to <lb/>reduce greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum consumption. If consumers undervalue fuel economy <lb/>improvements relative to their expected present value over the full life of a vehicle, the market will <lb/>provide too little fuel economy and will under-invest in research and development of energy efficient <lb/>technologies. In addition, policies that influence the market via purchase price such as feebates, or <lb/>regulatory policies such as fuel economy standards will have greater leverage on fuel economy than <lb/>fuel prices. Finally, if consumers undervalue fuel economy, such policies can increase private welfare <lb/>as well as providing societal benefits. If consumers fully value fuel economy improvements, then the <lb/>above assertions would be incorrect. <lb/>As important as it is to understand how the market for fuel economy really works, evidence from <lb/>econometric studies is unfortunately contradictory and inconclusive. Peer reviewed and grey literature <lb/>studies provide support for sizeable undervaluation, significant overvaluation and everything in <lb/>between. There is no definitive answer as to why this is so, but the complexity of the choice decision, <lb/>difficulty identifying and measuring all relevant variables, and consequent statistical problems caused <lb/>by omitted variables, errors in variables and correlations among variables appear to be a part of the <lb/>explanation. There is also reason to believe that the model of expected utility maximization via <lb/>continuously trading off multiple vehicle attributes may be an inaccurate description of consumers&apos; <lb/>actual decision making. This result is not unique to energy efficiency in the automotive market but <lb/>seems to be a general characteristic of markets for energy-using consumer durable goods. <lb/>What little market research is publicly available is decisively against the rational economic model <lb/>when it comes to fuel economy decision making. Survey evidence indicates that consumers require <lb/>short payback periods of 1.5 to 2.5 years. This is also consistent with anecdotal evidence from vehicle <lb/>manufacturers, who cite payback periods of 2-4 years. The most detailed evidence on consumers&apos; <lb/>decision making comes from a single study of 57 households in California. The researchers found no <lb/>evidence of the rational economic model in households&apos; decisions about fuel economy. Most of this <lb/>evidence comes from the United States and it is not clear to what extent it applies to countries with <lb/>much higher fuel prices. The theory of bounded rationality implies that if fuel prices are high enough <lb/>to make fuel economy one of consumers&apos; 3-5 top considerations, it may be considered in a manner <lb/>closer to the rational economic model. <lb/>The more recent theories of behavioral economics may provide a more appropriate quantitative <lb/>model. Behavioral economics has established that when faced with a risky bet, consumers exaggerate <lb/>the probability of loss and weigh potential losses approximately twice as much as potential gains. <lb/>Energy efficiency is a risky bet for consumers because of uncertainty about future fuel prices, the true <lb/>in-use energy efficiencies of vehicles as opposed to their official ratings, future vehicle use, vehicle <lb/>lifetime, and other factors. Uncertainty and loss aversion could explain consumers&apos; lack of interest in <lb/>quantifying potential future fuel savings and apparently short payback requirements. It may also <lb/>explain manufacturers&apos; reluctance to invest in increasing vehicle fuel economy. How to do welfare <lb/>analysis of public policies under such conditions has not yet been resolved. Unlike the model of risk <lb/></body>

			<body>aversion, the theory of loss aversion allows the possibility that a risky bet that consumers would <lb/>decline could actually increase well being if it were imposed by regulations such as fuel economy <lb/>standards. <lb/>Given the importance of the market for fuel economy, we know surprisingly little about how it <lb/>functions in the real world. More fundamental research of the type reported by Turrentine and Kurani <lb/>(2007) is needed. Alternative decision models need to be developed and tested. On balance, however, <lb/>the available evidence suggests that the market for fuel economy does not operate efficiently <lb/>according to the rational economic consumer model. At present, the theory of uncertainty and loss <lb/>aversion may be the most consistent with the available evidence. <lb/>NOTE <lb/>1. The term &quot; market failure &quot; is unfortunate because the usual meaning of the word failure conveys a <lb/>complete inability to perform a function. Market deficiency or imperfection are perhaps better <lb/>terms. <lb/></body>
