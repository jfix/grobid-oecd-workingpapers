Established renewable technologies will enter a competitive auction to set the strike prices, with an<lb/> administrative strike price acting as a ceiling for bids. The first capacity auction took place in December<lb/> 2014 for delivery of capacity from winter 2018–19.<lb/>  2018-2019: The Capacity Market starts to deliver capacity.<lb/>  2020s: Continued maturity of technologies and movement towards technology neutral auctions; additional<lb/> storage and interconnection, and well-functioning energy markets across the European Union, will play an<lb/> increasingly large role in managing supply and demand.<lb/>  Late 2020s and beyond: Technologies are mature enough and the carbon price is high and sustainable<lb/> enough to allow all generators to compete without intervention.</figDesc>
