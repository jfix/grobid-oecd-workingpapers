selected simulations in a DGSE framework This paper examines the short-term distributional effects of a number of tax and labour market reforms in 
the euro area, drawing on simulations using a micro-founded dynamic general equilibrium model. A 
heterogeneous household sector with two groups of consumers is considered. The first group maximises 
intertemporal utility over an infinite horizon in the presence of habit persistence. The second group is 
liquidity constrained and has no access to financial markets for intertemporal income transfers. It thus 
spends its disposable income entirely on current consumption. Although the examined reforms are 
estimated to boost aggregate consumption and output immediately after implementation, they have 
sizeable distributional effects. In particular, liquidity-constrained households may incur transitional losses 
after a cut in the benefit replacement ratio. Lowering employment and/or price adjustment costs could 
markedly reduce these short-term costs. A suitable compensation scheme could also reduce the uneven 
distribution of transitional losses, but at the expense of lower aggregate gains in the long run.

SELECTED SIMULATIONS IN A DGSE FRAMEWORK by 
Annabelle Mourougane and Lukas Vogel 1 1. 
Introduction and main findings 1. 
Opposition to structural reforms usually arise because of the limited knowledge on these reforms' 
distributional effects, especially in the short term. Indeed, reforms can generate (transitory) losses for 
specific population groups, even if long-term welfare gains are found to be positive (e.g. Alesina and 
Drazen, 1991; Drazen, 2000). However, very little information is currently available on the short-term 
costs of reforms and to what extent different groups of the population are affected. 2. 
Against this background, this paper examines the short-term distributional effects of a number of 
tax and labour market reforms, using a micro-founded dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) model 
calibrated for the euro area. DGE models are explicitly derived from the optimisation of agent behaviour 
under constraints. Their use presents a number of advantages. First, they allow a wide range of structural 
reforms to be examined and possible spillovers between the variables to be taken into account. 2 Second, 
these models are less subject to the Lucas critique as they are based on structural equations with sound 
microeconomic foundations. Third, it is possible to assess policies through their effects on consumer 
welfare. Finally, DGE models encompass dynamic effects and are well suited to examine the adjustment to 
changes in economic structure and policy. However, the lag structure reflects the optimisation-based 
micro-foundations and is generally limited and similar across regions or countries. Consequently, DGE 
results may tend to overemphasise similarities and to attribute differences to shocks rather than to 
economic structure. The empirical validation of DGE models is an important concern, but also an active 
field of economic research. Both the model dynamics and steady-state values can be quite sensitive to 
particular functional forms and parameter choices. 3. 
In order to focus on the distributional effects of reforms, a heterogeneous household sector with 
two groups of consumers is considered. The first group maximises intertemporal utility over an infinite 
planning horizon in the presence of habit persistence (e.g. Fuhrer, 2000; Smets and Wouters, 2003). 2 The 
second group is liquidity-constrained (the so-called rule-of-thumb consumers), has no access to financial 
markets for intertemporal income transfers and consequently spends its disposable period income entirely 
on current consumption (e.g. Galí et al., 2004, 2007). 4. 
The main conclusions are the following: 1.

Coppel, Jørgen Elmeskov, Claude Giorno, Peter Hoeller, Vincent Koen and Jean-Luc Schneider for helpful 
comments and suggestions and wish to thank Penny Elghadab for valuable editorial support. The views 
expressed in this paper do not necessarily reflect those of the OECD. 2. 
For instance, Coenen et al. (2007) examine the effects of temporary fiscal measures. Everaert and Schule 
(2006) use the IMF's global economy model to explore transitory costs of reforms. Imperfect competition 
in labour and product markets is modelled in a stylised manner through the existence of mark-ups. 
Similarly, Kilponen and Ripatti (2005) have investigated the quantitative effects of an increase in 
competition in both product and labour markets. Batini et al. (2005) examine the impact of combined fiscal 
adjustment and structural reforms for Japan. ECO/WKP(2008)56 6 − Although the examined labour market reforms are estimated to boost aggregate consumption 
and output immediately after implementation, they have sizeable distributional effects. 
Liquidity-constrained households may incur transitional losses after a cut in the benefit 
replacement ratio. − A reduction in the average income tax rate or in employer social security contributions would 
not involve transitory losses for liquidity-constrained households, although gains from the 
reform will be unequally distributed between the two types of households. − Lowering employment and/or price adjustment costs could markedly reduce the short-term 
costs for liquidity-constrained households from a cut in the benefit replacement ratio, without 
changing the long-term impact of the reform. The absence of long-term effects reflects the 
introduction of specific types of adjustment costs in the model, notably the fact that no 
distinction is made between gross and net fluctuations in employment. − A suitable compensation scheme could also reduce the potential short-term losses from a cut 
in the benefit replacement rate, but at the expense of lower aggregate gains in the long run. 
More generally, there appears to be a trade-off between long-run aggregate effects of reforms 
and more equal distribution of these gains through a redistribution scheme at least when the 
latter is not phased out once the pay-off from reforms for liquidity-constrained consumers 
moves to positive territory. Decisions on the design of reforms and compensation of losers 
will thus depend on the country's preferences in terms of efficiency gains and equity. 5. 
The paper first describes the DGE model that will subsequently used to simulate the impact of 
selected tax and labour market reforms. Both the theoretical framework and the calibration of the model 
are detailed. The short-term distributional effects of a number of simulations are then discussed. These 
include a cut in the average income tax rate, a cut in the benefit replacement rate and a cut in the employer 
social security contribution rate are then discussed. The implications of a budgetary compensation scheme 
to lessen short-term costs for specific groups are also examined. A final section concludes. 2. 
Framework of the DGE model 6. 
This section presents the DGE model used to perform a number of policy simulations in the euro 
area. The model assumes a closed economy with monopolistic competition in product and labour markets, 
which provides firms and unions with price and wage setting power. Firms use a bundle of differentiated 
labour services to produce a bundle of differentiated goods. Labour is the only production factor and yields 
constant returns to scale. Households 7. 
The household sector consists of a continuum of households 
. A share 
of these 
households faces liquidity constraints. Liquidity-constrained households, labelled 
, have no 
access to financial markets and consume their current disposable income at each period. By contrast, 
unconstrained households, labelled 
, have full access to financial markets. They can buy and sell 
assets and transfer income over time. Lifetime utility is the expected discounted value of utility at each period over an infinite horizon. The 
utility function is additive in the utility from consumption and the disutility from work : (1) ECO/WKP(2008)56 7 where 
indicates the degree of habit persistence, and the weight of leisure. The higher the 
degree of habit persistence, the slower is the adjustment of consumption and output to a structural reform. 
The parameters and 
respectively denote the discount factor and the labour supply elasticity. The 
parameter h is assumed to be zero for the liquidity-constrained households. 8. 
Each household supplies differentiated labour services in a monopolistically competitive labour 
market. For simplicity, the labour services of liquidity-constrained and intertemporally optimising 
households are assumed to be of comparable quality. Labour inputs are then combined in a CES bundle of 
the differentiated labour services: with as the elasticity of substitution between services. Demand for variety is a function of the relative wage and of total labour demand: (2) 9. 
The budget constraint of unrestricted households is: (3) with 
the nominal wage of household , 
the average nominal wage, 
is the labour income tax, 
the replacement rate for the non-employed part of the household (a proxy of the reservation wage), 
profits, 
nominal consumption, 
the consumption tax rate, 
one-period government bonds bought 
at the start of period , the nominal interest rate, and 
lump-sum taxes. The parameter 
is the 
share of lump-sum taxes levied from the non liquidity-constrained households. Liquidity-constrained households can neither save current income nor borrow against future income. They 
do not receive any profit. As a result, their net expenditure at each period equals their net income: (4) Consumption 10. 
Households consume a bundle of differentiated goods, each one being provided by a firm 
. Aggregate consumption thus equals: with as the elasticity of substitution between . Demand for 
depends on the relative price of the 
variety and on the aggregate demand for consumption goods: ECO/WKP(2008)56 8 (5) 11. 
Intertemporally optimising households choose the consumption path that ensures equality of the 
discounted marginal utility of consumption expenditure at each point of time. Differentiating utility (2) 
under the budget restriction (3) gives the marginal utility of consumption: (6) 12. 
Moreover, the intertemporal optimality condition that determines income transfers, i.e. the 
optimal amount of saving, reads: (7) Combining the first-order conditions (6) and (7) yields the optimal consumption path: (8) 13. 
The liquidity-constrained households spend all their currently disposable income on current 
consumption. The marginal utility of income, derived from maximising (2) with 
under restriction (4) 
is: (9) Consumption under the budget constraint (4) equals: (10) 14. 
Finally, aggregate consumption is the weighted sum of the consumption levels of both types of 
households: (11) Labour market 15. 
Labour unions set wages for the differentiated households in a monopolistically competitive 
labour market. It is assumed that optimising and liquidity-constrained consumers are uniformly distributed 
across types of labour and hence across unions (see e.g. Galí et al., 2007). At each period, a typical union, 
representing workers of type i, sets the wage to maximise the marginal value of income subject to the 
labour demand function (2). The optimum wage obtained from differentiating (1) under the constraints (2) 
and (3) -or (4) for liquidity-constrained households -with respect to 
is: 3 3. 
This first-order condition assumes that unions neglect the effect of wage levels on unemployment transfer 
levels, e.g. that unions care only about the working insiders. If unions took into account that, given the 
replacement rate, higher wages imply higher transfers to the unemployed and higher household income, the 
first-order condition would become ECO/WKP(2008)56 9 All unions target the same wage, and wages are fully flexible, so that 
. The previous expression 
simplifies to: The replacement rate exerts upward pressures on wages. The union weights the utility of labour income 
using the weighted average of constrained and unconstrained households' marginal utility of consumption, 
i.e. 
. Inserting (6) and (9) along this weighting scheme yields: (12) 16. 
Employment is equal across households, i.e. 
, as firms allocate labour demand 
uniformly across different workers, Production and prices 17. 
The production sector consists of a continuum of firms 
producing a differentiated 
product and setting prices in a monopolistically competitive product market. Labour is the only input and 
yields constant returns to scale. Without loss of generality, the technology parameter is normalised to one. 
Consequently, gross output of firm under this simple production function is: (13) 18. 
Each firm faces quadratic employment and price adjustment costs 
and 
respectively. 
Adjustment costs are sunk costs that use part of the output and drive a wedge between production and 
consumption. Labour adjustment costs can be interpreted as hiring and firing costs and price adjustment 
costs as menu costs. A common specification of quadratic per-unit adjustment costs of firm (e.g. Cahuc 
and Zylberberg, 2004; Hamermesh, 1995; Rotemberg, 1982) is: The choice of a quadratic specification has obviously some implications on the path to adjust to policy 
shocks. However, using linear rather than quadratic adjustment costs would not fundamentally modify the 
results (Mourougane and Vogel, 2008). and the subsequent wage setting equation would change accordingly. ECO/WKP(2008)56 10 19. 
The aggregate level of output is: Assuming firms adjust at the same time, as in Rotemberg (1982), there is no relative price dispersion and 
. Following equation (5), consumption demand equally spreads across the product varieties . 
Symmetry also implies adjustment costs are identical across firms, so that 
and . Consequently, aggregate output equals: (14) Firms set the price so as to maximise their discounted stream of profits: , which yields the dynamic price-setting equation (15) 20. 
Quadratic price adjustment costs reduce the elasticity of prices to current production costs and 
introduce a forward-looking component into pricing decisions. Aggregate demand influences the current 
level of output and employment because of the sluggish price adjustment. Both employment and price 
adjustment costs generate gaps between actual output and the production level that would prevail under 
perfectly flexible markets. 4 The marginal value of income 
in equation (15) refers to intertemporal 
optimisers only, because liquidity-constrained consumers do not own firms. Without adjustment costs, 
, equation (15) reduces to 
. The latter is the standard pricing rule 
under monopolistic competition and flexible prices, when 
are the marginal costs of production. Monetary and fiscal policies 21. 
The government budget is assumed to be balanced over the long-run. The government collects a 
wage income tax , a consumption tax , and employer social security contributions . It pays transfers 
at the replacement rate to unemployed household members and issues bonds 
to balance the budget. 
It can also levy lump-sum taxes to this aim. Public final demand is omitted for simplicity, but this would 
not substantially modify the results. The government budget constraint is: (16) 4. 
Note that although price adjustment costs introduce persistence in prices, they do not generate inflation 
persistence. In order to generate inflation persistence one would have to include some form of price 
indexation (e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2003) or backward-looking behaviour in the formation of 
expectations. ECO/WKP(2008)56 11 22. 
Forward-looking consumption and price setting behaviour requires a policy rule to ensure the 
uniqueness and stability of the equilibrium. To keep the analysis simple, policy rates are assumed to react 
to current inflation: (17) with 
in all simulations. The inclusion of an output gap in the policy rule would require the choice 
of a specific definition for potential output within the DGE framework. In addition some may argue that 
output gap estimates are particularly uncertain in the aftermath of structural reforms. As the ECB usually 
focuses on price stability, a monetary reaction function with inflation as the main determinant appears to be 
a plausible assumption. Table 1. Calibration of the parameters Variable

Calibration of the model 23. 
The calibration of the model parameters builds on the estimated euro area DGE models of 
Coenen et al. (2007) and Grenouilleau et al. (2007) as well as mark-up estimates from Christopoulou and 
Vermeulen (2008) and tax and benefit data from OECD (2007) (see Table 1). The parameter of price 
adjustment costs matches the empirical evidence on average price duration in the euro area and the United 
States (Altissimo et al., 2006; Bils and Klenow, 2004). The fiscal parameters follow the OECD (2007) tax 
and benefits data for euro area countries and are consistent with those in Coenen et al. (2007). 
Unemployment in the model being unemployment of second earners, the average replacement rate is for a 
spouse in work. 24. 
The estimated average elasticity of substitution in the goods market in Christopoulou and 
Vermeulen (2008) suggests a 25% price mark-up. The elasticity of substitution between labour services 
from Coenen et al. (2007) implies a 20% steady-state wage mark-up. The remaining parameter values are 
taken from the euro area models of Coenen et al. (2007), Grenouilleau et al. (2007) and Smets and 
Wouters (2003) and are in line with other empirical studies. ECO/WKP(2008)56 12 4. 
Simulations 25. 
The short-term distributional effects of reforms are examined using DGE model-based 
simulations. Three types of policy changes are considered: a one percentage-point cut in the 
(unemployment) benefit replacement rate, a one percentage-point average income tax rate cut and a one 
percentage-point cut in employer social security contributions. The main mechanisms at play in the model 
following a cut in these policy variables are: − An income tax rate cut increases the net real wage, labour supply and current disposable 
income, while a decrease in employer social security contributions directly reduces 
production costs and consequently dampens prices. − Unemployment benefits can be assimilated to a reservation wage and reduce labour supply at 
given real wage levels. As a result, lower benefits will raise labour supply, even though they 
may temporarily decrease disposable income. − Disposable income and consumption of liquidity-constrained households are affected by the 
way reforms are financed (self-financing of reforms or introduction of a scheme to balance 
the budget). 5. 
Some reforms entail short-term costs 26. 
The distributional effects of reforms vary widely across the different policy measures. In 
particular, the impact on consumption of a cut in income tax or in social security contributions is positive 
in the short term for both types of households, while differences are more pronounced for a reduction in the 
benefit replacement rate (Figures 1 to 3). In the latter case, liquidity-constrained households experience an 
initial decline in their level of consumption, while non-constrained households do not. This result suggests 
that structural reforms can display short-term costs concentrated on specific population groups. The 
absence of transitional losses for some specific groups of the population reflects to a large extent the 
specific shock introduced here namely a cut in the average income tax rate. A cut in the top rate or in the 
rate that applies to low-income workers could generate significant distributional effects, depending on the 
way the loss in government revenue is counterbalanced. Despite the absence of short-term losses, the gains 
from an income tax cut or a cut in social security contributions will not be equally distributed across the 
two types of households. 27. 
Employment adjustment costs have temporary but moderate effects on the distribution of short-
term income and consumption gains between households. Reducing euro area employment adjustment 
costs to their US levels has virtually no effect on the consumption path of intertemporally optimising 
households but a more pronounced impact on liquidity-constrained households. 5 Indeed, it reduces the 
amplitude of the decline in real wages during the transition, so that the consumption of liquidity-
constrained agents is higher. In most cases, price adjustment costs are found to have only a marginal 
impact on real adjustment after structural reforms, the main exception being in the case of a benefit 
replacement rate cut (Figure 2). 5. 
It is assumed that a budget-neutral policy immediately offsets the wealth effect of fiscal measures by lump-
sum transfers. Each household type receives or pays a proportionate share of these transfers. ECO/WKP(2008)56 13 Figure 1.

households respectively. 28. 
The impact of employment and price adjustment costs varies across policy measures. Lower 
employment adjustment costs accelerate the adjustment of real wages and liquidity-constrained 
consumption after an income tax rate cut or a cut in employer social security contributions. However, the 
difference is more pronounced after a benefit replacement rate reduction, as liquidity-constrained 
consumers initially lose income. Lower adjustment costs attenuate and shorten the temporary real wage 
decline and the transitory real consumption loss for liquidity-constrained households. In the same vein, 
lowering price adjustment costs is found to have a marked effect only in the case of a cut in the benefit 
replacement rate. Indeed, the reduction of the reservation wage exerts downward pressure on real wages 
and lowers production costs. The faster the reaction of prices to lower production costs, the more contained 
is the drop in real wages and the decline in real consumption from liquidity-constrained households. ECO/WKP(2008)56 15 Figure 3. One percentage-point cut in social security contributions (Percentage change compared to baseline, percentage points for inflation) ––– Euro area ―― Euro area with US labour adjustment costs ----US labour and price adjustment costs Note: IO and LC designate  " intertemporal optimisers "  i.e. unconstrained households, and  " liquidity-constrained "  
households respectively. ECO/WKP(2008)56 16 6. 
Budgetary compensation schemes can reduce potential short-term costs 29. 
The introduction of a fiscal rule to balance the government budget after the implementation of 
structural reforms can have a marked impact on the short-term adjustment and the long-run distribution of 
efficiency gains (Figures 4 to 6). Under a deficit-neutral reform, the government budget is balanced at each 
point in time, assuming for simplicity the availability of lump-sum taxes and transfers to achieve this 
balance. Lump-sum measures offset the wealth effect of reforms without introducing further substitution 
effects. 6 Relying on distortionary taxation and demand components instead would affect incentives and 
either reinforce or weaken the initial impact of the reform. The baseline scenario assumes that liquidity-
constrained households proportionately share the fiscal burden after a tax cut or the reduction in social 
security contributions, or the fiscal gains from a reduction in the benefit replacement rate. Under an 
alternative scenario, the fiscal burden or gain is entirely shifted to the intertemporally optimising 
households. 30. 
Shifting the entire fiscal burden of an income tax cut or a reduction in employer social security 
contributions to intertemporally optimising households diminishes the gains of the latter from structural 
reforms. By contrast, liquidity-constrained consumers experience an increase in disposable income and 
consumption. Depriving liquidity-constrained households from the fiscal gains from lower unemployment 
transfers would have the opposite effect. Liquidity-constrained households would lose in net wealth terms, 
while optimising consumers would gain compared to the baseline redistribution scheme, where budgetary 
surpluses are shared between the two types of households. 31. 
A budget consolidation scheme would affect not only the relative long-term position of the two 
types of consumers, but also aggregate production and consumption in the long run. Exempting liquidity-
constrained consumers from fiscal consolidation reduces aggregate output, while excluding them from the 
redistribution of fiscal surpluses would moderately raise long-run production. These effects reflect mostly 
the assumption of a diminishing marginal utility of income. Liquidity-constrained households do not 
receive profits and dividends from firms and thus consume less than unconstrained households in the 
steady state. The exemption from fiscal consolidation raises liquidity-constrained consumers' disposable 
income and consumption. Given the decreasing marginal utility of consumption, labour supply declines 
and wage claims rise, reducing equilibrium employment and production. Excluding liquidity-constrained 
households from the redistribution of fiscal gains would reduce their disposable income and lead to wage 
moderation and higher production. As structural reforms have a permanent budgetary impact in the model 
these income effects are also long-lasting. 32. 
Overall the introduction of a budgetary compensation scheme can help to alleviate short-term 
transition costs borne by certain population groups, thereby reducing potential opposition to reforms. The 
counterpart is that the expected positive long-term effects of structural reforms will also be diminished. 
However, aggregate long-term effects are a weighted average across both types of households. Computing 
measures of aggregate welfare is not straightforward and the weighting of individual pay-offs is a matter of 
social choice, as are the weights attributed to efficiency versus equity outcomes. 6. 
As the intertemporal optimisers operate under an infinite planning horizon the time structure of budget 
consolidation does not affect private sector behaviour in this case. Budget balancing may even only occur 
in the distant future. ECO/WKP(2008)56 17 Figure 4.

Conclusions 33. 
This paper has cast some light on the short-term distributional effects of selected structural 
reforms using DGE-based simulations and differentiating the impact on liquidity-constrained households 
which cannot fully optimise their consumption patterns over time and non-constrained households, which 
have full access to financial markets. The main conclusion is that liquidity-constrained households are 
found to experience significant short-term losses after a cut in the benefit replacement rate. By contrast, 
cuts in the average income tax rate or in employer social security contributions do not generate similar 
short-term losses. Taking measures that lower price and employment adjustment costs or, alternatively, 
introducing a budgetary scheme that compensates losers can reduce these short-term losses. The first 
alternative may appear more promising as it has no impact on the long-term benefits of reforms, but this 
also reflects the way adjustment costs are modelled in the DGE model. At the same time, setting up a fiscal 
compensation scheme may be easier and faster to implement than trying to alter adjustment costs, as policy 
makers have a direct control on fiscal instruments. Overall, the final decision about the extent of 
redistribution will depend on the country's social preferences in terms of economic efficiency and equity. 34. 
The work undertaken in this paper is subject to the usual caveats of using simple DGE models 
(De Grauwe, 2008). In addition, a number of extensions are worth investigating. First, it would be useful 
to replicate this work for other countries using alternative calibration of habit persistence or labour supply 
parameters to check the robustness of the findings. Second, the framework could be extended to examine in 
more detail how different population groups are affected by structural reforms in the short term (e.g. 
households differentiated by employment status, earnings or age). ECO/WKP(2008)56 21 BIBLIOGRAPHY Alesina, A. and A. Drazen (1991),  " Why Are Stabilizations Delayed? " , American Economic Review,
