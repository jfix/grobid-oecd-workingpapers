			<body>METHODOLOGICAL NOTE <lb/>This paper aims at providing an estimate of the resource envelope required in order to <lb/>achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on the global level. As widely <lb/>acknowledged by previous contributors to this literature, modelling the cost of achieving the <lb/>MDGs poses many data and methodological challenges. <lb/>Like previous contributions, this paper relies on a very simple growth model to relate <lb/>development financing — private or public — to growth in order to estimate how much it would <lb/>cost to halve poverty across developing countries. The virtue of this model is precisely its <lb/>simplicity but the trade-off is that it does not claim to take account of the effects of increases in <lb/>development financing, tax revenues, public expenditure and transfers on the general <lb/>equilibrium of the economy to which it is applied. For instance, increasing the supply of <lb/>schooling does not necessarily guarantee that it will be met with an equivalent increase in the <lb/>demand for education. The model used in this paper simply provides orders of magnitude that <lb/>are helpful to size up the challenges that meeting MDGs entails for low-and middle-income <lb/>countries. <lb/>Similarly, when measuring the amount of transfers or government expenditure that it <lb/>would take to achieve the poverty, education and health MDGs across countries, this paper <lb/>acknowledges that the link between inputs and outcomes is often weak and that absorption and <lb/>delivery issues can represent significant challenges in developing countries. From this <lb/>perspective, the orders of magnitude presented cannot be taken to be precise estimates, <lb/>especially at the country level, of how much public expenditure would be needed to increase in <lb/>order to achieve specific MDGs. The importance of framing the corresponding debate in the <lb/>larger framework of the quality of public policy and institutions is, indeed, a key take-away from <lb/>the MDG costing exercise undertaken in this paper. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>4 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>NOTE MÉTHODOLOGIQUE <lb/>Le présent document vise à fournir une estimation de l&apos;enveloppe de ressources qui serait <lb/>nécessaire pour atteindre au niveau mondial les Objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement <lb/>(OMDs). Comme il a été largement reconnu par les contributions précédentes à cette littérature, <lb/>la modélisation du coût de la réalisation des OMDs implique des défis relatifs à la méthodologie <lb/>et aux données. Comme les contributions antérieures, cet article s&apos;appuie sur un modèle de <lb/>croissance très simple pour lier le financement du développement — privé ou public — à la <lb/>croissance afin d&apos;estimer quel serait le coût d&apos;une réduction de moitié de la pauvreté dans les <lb/>pays en voie de développement. Ce modèle a précisément pour vertu sa simplicité mais la <lb/>contrepartie est qu&apos;il n&apos;a pas la prétention de tenir compte des effets de l&apos;augmentation du <lb/>financement du développement, des recettes fiscales, des dépenses et des transferts publiques <lb/>sur l&apos;équilibre général de l&apos;économie à laquelle il est appliqué. Par exemple, un accroissement de <lb/>l&apos;offre de la scolarité ne garantit pas nécessairement qu&apos;il soit rejoint par une augmentation <lb/>équivalente de la demande d&apos;éducation. Le modèle sur lequel ce document se repose génère des <lb/>ordres de grandeur qui sont utiles pour évaluer la taille du défi que représente <lb/>l&apos;accomplissement des OMDs pour les pays à bas et moyens revenus. <lb/>De même, dans le cadre de la mesure du montant des transferts ou des dépenses <lb/>gouvernementales nécessaires pour atteindre les OMDs relatifs à la pauvreté, l&apos;éducation et la <lb/>santé, ce document reconnaît que le lien entre les intrants et les résultats est souvent faible et que <lb/>la capacité d&apos;absorption et l&apos;efficacité des services publiques peuvent représenter des défis <lb/>importants dans les pays en voie de développement. Dans cette perspective, les ordres de <lb/>grandeur présentés ne peuvent être considérés comme des estimations précises, en particulier au <lb/>niveau des pays, du montant dont les dépenses publiques devaient croître pour atteindre des <lb/>OMDs spécifiques. L&apos;importance de recadrer le débat correspondant dans le contexte plus large <lb/>de la qualité des institutions et des politiques publiques est, précisément, une des conclusions <lb/>tirées du présent exercice de mesures des coûts des OMDs entrepris dans ce document. <lb/></body>

The landscape of development finance has evolved, with <lb/>the emergence of new actors and sources of financing. In parallel, efforts have been made to <lb/>improve the efficiency of the international financing architecture. The conclusions of the Fourth <lb/>High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness point to the need to broaden attention beyond aid <lb/>effectiveness to the challenges of effective development. This has called for the establishment of a <lb/>new, inclusive and representative Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation. <lb/>Assessing the magnitude of the remaining financing challenges is paramount to support <lb/>the advancement of the international development debate, including the achievement of the <lb/>Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Surprisingly, few estimates or projections on MDG <lb/>costs have been prepared for all developing countries. This paper fills this void by providing <lb/>fresh orders of magnitude about the cost of reaching the MDGs by 2015. It goes on further to <lb/>argue that the scale of financing needed to achieve the MDGs requires that development finance <lb/>looks beyond official development assistance as its principal resource. <lb/>As the economic crisis weighs on public budgets in OECD donor countries, the challenge <lb/>of meeting the MDGs at the global level is shown in this paper to be unaffordable using official <lb/>development assistance alone. In fact, improved domestic tax collection continues to make a <lb/>growing contribution to the financing of development in all developing countries. This paper <lb/>however shows that in many low-income countries, domestic taxes still cannot be expected to <lb/>help to meet the MDGs in the foreseeable future. Raising additional revenue takes time in low-<lb/>income countries and it requires a determined effort to strengthen institutional capacity. Making <lb/>sure that these new resources do help to meet the MDGs will require an additional political <lb/>effort. Indeed, the poor quality of public expenditure remains a major hurdle for developing <lb/>countries to meet the aspirations of their citizens. <lb/>Achieving the MDGs therefore requires many conditions besides financing. It requires <lb/>good institutions to design, implement and evaluate policies, notably in the form of strong public <lb/>expenditure management at and across all levels of government, good implementation capacity, <lb/>and a medium-term fiscal policy that ensures the sustainability of the MDGs. Effective public <lb/>expenditures and the nexus between revenues and expenditures are at the core of the OECD&apos;s <lb/>work and will feature prominently in the Global Forum on Development 2012. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>8 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>The OECD Development Centre is committed to improving the quality of government <lb/>expenditure with the aim of ensuring competiveness and of improving social cohesion in <lb/>developing and emerging countries. This paper is meant to feed the corresponding policy <lb/>dialogue amongst the Centre&apos;s member countries. <lb/>Mario PEZZINI <lb/>Director <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>December 2011 <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>9 <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Ce document présente une nouvelle estimation du montant des ressources financières <lb/>nécessaires aux pays en voie de développement pour atteindre les Objectifs du Millénaire pour le <lb/>développement (OMDs). Les approches utilisées jusqu&apos;à présent mettent trop souvent l&apos;accent <lb/>sur l&apos;aide publique au développement (APD) et négligent le potentiel des autres sources de <lb/>financement, comme les recettes fiscales nationales ou les flux de capitaux privés. Le document <lb/>fournit une estimation du besoin de financement additionnel pour atteindre les OMDs en <lb/>matière de pauvreté, d&apos;éducation et de santé; il estime également le montant qui pourrait être <lb/>couvert par un accroissement des revenus fiscaux des pays en voie de développement. Au <lb/>niveau mondial, en moyenne, le potentiel représenté par une amélioration de la collecte fiscale <lb/>correspond au montant des ressources supplémentaires nécessaires pour atteindre les OMDs. <lb/>Pour beaucoup de pays pris individuellement, toutefois, d&apos;importantes ressources externes <lb/>seront encore nécessaires.

Although at the global <lb/>level the magnitude of potential additional resources available from improved tax collection is <lb/>similar to that of the additional resources needed to achieve the goals, on a country by country <lb/>basis substantial external resources will still be needed.

			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>An ancient parable describes the blind men who encounter an elephant and take turns <lb/>describing it based on the part of the animal&apos;s body that they touch. Touching the smooth, sharp <lb/>tusk, one describes the elephant like a spear. Holding the squirming trunk, another describes the <lb/>elephant like a snake. Feeling the elephant&apos;s sturdy knee, still another describes the elephant like <lb/>a tree. This parable shows that we can look at the same thing from many different directions, <lb/>with each view offering an element of truth. However, we only grasp the full complexity of what <lb/>we are trying to understand when we take all perspectives together. Understanding <lb/>development success and how to achieve it holds a similar challenge. Development economists <lb/>are like the blind men examining the elephant, often only narrowly seeing one part of a bigger, <lb/>more complex picture. Few development issues exemplify this point more than the longstanding <lb/>debate over the costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). <lb/>We are approaching the 2015 deadline for achieving the MDGs in a vastly different global <lb/>economic and political climate than that in which the goals were initially formulated in 2000. In <lb/>the late 1990s, many developing countries had experienced shaky economic transitions from <lb/>socialist planning, debilitating financial crises, and in a number of cases both. Official <lb/>development assistance (ODA) budgets had shrunk since the end of the Cold War, and many <lb/>rich countries had reduced their engagement in the developing world. The MDGs proved <lb/>extremely useful at refocusing the development community on measurable, achievable and time-<lb/>bound goals. In particular, this invigorated the development co-operation efforts of OECD <lb/>countries that are members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and re-ignited <lb/>their engagement in partner countries. After a decade of declining aid budgets during the 1990s, <lb/>the MDGs helped to galvanise the international aid community to dedicate an increased amount <lb/>of resources to development co-operation in the 2000s. <lb/>More than a decade later, the nature of development co-operation has changed. This <lb/>change is due to the emergence of new poles of growth in the developing world as well as <lb/>recession and increasing calls for fiscal austerity in rich countries. Partly out of necessity, sources <lb/>for financing development have diversified and include rapidly growing South-South aid, trade <lb/>and investment flows. Although aid and development co-operation still play an important, <lb/>catalytic role, there is a general recognition that aid alone cannot reduce poverty and foster <lb/>development. A number of countries have also increased their capacity to collect tax revenue and <lb/>mobilise other domestic resources as forms of development finance. Tax revenues are already <lb/>10 times larger than ODA on the African continent even though this average hides considerable <lb/>country-to-country differences (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010). <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>12 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>In this new context, it is timely to revisit the costing estimates that many development <lb/>agencies contributed to during the early 2000s. A fresh perspective on countries&apos; capacity to fund <lb/>additional development investment on their own is needed. The purpose of this paper is to offer <lb/>an assessment of the orders of magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs in the <lb/>developing world as a whole and compare this level with the degree of financial resources <lb/>available, domestic and external. While this paper offers a specific figure for how much <lb/>achieving the MDGs could cost, the aim is not to propose that the international community <lb/>scramble to meet this cost. Rather, these estimates should be used for understanding the size of <lb/>the problem that continues to face many countries. Although it is not an insurmountably high <lb/>amount, it is of an order of magnitude larger than the size of resources that could be raised from <lb/>development co-operation alone. <lb/>The estimates presented in this paper show that achieving the first six MDGs 1 <lb/>Table 1: Summary Results of MDG Cost Estimates (2009 USD billion) <lb/>globally <lb/>requires approximately USD 120 billion in additional annual expenditures on health, education <lb/>and poverty reduction worldwide. This is roughly twice the size of the potential increase in tax <lb/>revenues obtainable from improved tax collection efforts in developing countries. It is also <lb/>comparable to the size of current (net country-programmable) ODA flows. Approximately half of <lb/>the needed expenditures is in low-income countries, while the other half is needed in middle-<lb/>income countries. While middle-income countries are much more likely to afford these <lb/>additional expenditures themselves, the needs in low-income countries are concentrated in a <lb/>small group of countries that currently receive only about a quarter of ODA flows. Increased tax <lb/>revenue collection in middle-income countries is one way in which the (re)allocation of ODA <lb/>towards low-income countries that need it the most can be further advanced. <lb/> &quot; Financing gap &quot; <lb/>Service provision <lb/>(expenditures on cash <lb/>transfers, education <lb/>and health ) <lb/>Number of <lb/>countries <lb/>Low-income countries with a financing gap <lb/>62.1 <lb/>--<lb/>20 <lb/>Low-income countries without a financing gap <lb/>--<lb/>20.2 <lb/>19 <lb/>Middle-income countries <lb/>--<lb/>39 <lb/>60 <lb/>Total <lb/>121.3 <lb/>99 <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>1. <lb/>This paper only considers MDGs 1-6. Environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and partnership for <lb/>development (MDG 8) are explicitly excluded, as these goals necessitate substantial contributions by <lb/>developed countries, while the first six could be conceivably achieved solely by developing countries <lb/>themselves. This paper divides the six remaining MDGs into three broad categories, looking at income <lb/>poverty (MDG 1), health (MDGs 4, 5, 6) and education (MDGs 2, 3). Gender equality is thus treated <lb/>narrowly as an education issue because one of MDG 3&apos;s key targets is gender equality in primary <lb/>education enrolment. This is admittedly unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, but is considered <lb/>necessary to maintain a sufficiently generalisable approach. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>13 <lb/>The USD 120 billion estimate is based on rough calculations (summarised in Table 1) that <lb/>a USD 62.1 billion &quot; financing gap &quot; should be filled in 20 low-income countries, while <lb/>USD 59.2 billion in expenditures on developmental services provision should be made in 79 <lb/>other low-and middle-income countries 2 <lb/>The rest of this paper looks at how these estimates were obtained and what type of <lb/>caution needs to be exhibited when using these figures. Section II places these calculations in the <lb/>context of past efforts to measure MDG costs and the availability of domestic resources. <lb/>Section III presents the methods used to calculate the costs of financing poverty reduction, health <lb/>and education, as well as to calculate the scope for increasing domestic resources through <lb/>increased tax revenues. Section IV documents the results of these calculations. Section V <lb/>concludes. <lb/>. Separately, calculations show that some USD 64 billion <lb/>in additional tax revenues could be collected through improved tax effort, primarily in middle-<lb/>income countries. Unfortunately, however, the bulk of these additional resources would be <lb/>raised in countries that are already on track for achieving the MDGs. <lb/>2. <lb/>For the purposes of this paper missing baseline data from the early 1990s and missing data from the late <lb/>2000s are extrapolated from either trends in GDP per capita growth, or in expenditure growth, where <lb/>possible. This permits the estimation of the additional cost of MDG achievement needed in 99 countries. <lb/>While these simplifying assumptions are not ideal, they are sufficient for the purpose of estimating <lb/>broad orders of magnitude. These simplifying assumptions have been adopted to ensure the broadest <lb/>number of countries, particularly low-income fragile states, are included in the estimates in this paper, <lb/>as the aim is to compare a broad estimate of the magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs <lb/>with a broad estimate of the magnitude of extra budgetary and non-budgetary resources available to <lb/>meet the goals. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>II. PUTTING MDG COSTING AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE <lb/>INTO CONTEXT <lb/>The most recent Global Monitoring Report (World Bank and IMF, 2011) shows that the <lb/>world is on track to reduce by half the number of people living on less than a dollar a day. <lb/>However, progress is uneven country-to-country as 17 countries in Africa are far from halving <lb/>extreme poverty. The world is also close but still has progress to make to achieve gender parity <lb/>in primary and secondary education, provide access to safe drinking water and ensure primary <lb/>education completion. At the same time it is clear that global progress is too slow on child and <lb/>maternal mortality. There still exists a need to increase efforts to improve MDG progress, and in <lb/>many cases increased financial resources are an important ingredient of this improved progress. <lb/>MDG cost estimates have been instrumental in quantifying the need for increased resources to <lb/>improve progress over the past decade, despite drawbacks and caveats with many costing <lb/>methods. <lb/>This section looks briefly at past efforts to estimate the cost of MDG achievement and the <lb/>criticisms that many of these cost estimates have faced. It shows that one of the main drawbacks <lb/>of earlier cost estimates was their implicit assumption that increased spending for MDG <lb/>achievement necessarily need come from increased aid flows. Finally, it shows that a separate <lb/>literature on the role of domestic resource mobilisation in development finance demonstrates <lb/>that countries&apos; potential for financing their own development is increasing. &quot; Tax effort &quot; is <lb/>presented as one way to measure the degree to which countries are adequately mobilising the <lb/>potential of domestic resources available. <lb/>II.1. Past Efforts to Estimate the Cost of the MDGs <lb/>Numerous articles and reports since the early 2000s have attempted to quantify the cost of <lb/>achieving the MDGs. A chief objective of many of these previous MDG costing exercises was to <lb/>argue for scaled-up development co-operation efforts by DAC member countries to help <lb/>development partners finance the achievement of their own MDG targets. While this paper <lb/>argues that the narrow objective of scaling-up development co-operation efforts is of limited <lb/>usefulness, particularly given the financing constraints facing many DAC member countries, it <lb/>nonetheless tries to emulate the most reasonable lessons of the approaches of past MDG costing <lb/>exercises. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>15 <lb/>Table 2: Previous Global MDG Cost Estimates <lb/>Estimated additional <lb/>annual cost <lb/>(current USD billion) <lb/>Estimated additional <lb/>annual cost <lb/>(2009 USD billion) <lb/>Notes <lb/>United Nations (2001) <lb/>50 <lb/>61 <lb/>Estimates drawn from the Report <lb/>of the High-Level Panel on <lb/>Financing <lb/>for <lb/>Development, <lb/>chaired by Ernesto Zedillo. <lb/>Devarajan et al. (2002) <lb/>54-62 <lb/>63-72 <lb/>First calculation based on financing <lb/>gap for limited group of countries; <lb/>second calculation based on <lb/>estimated health, education, and <lb/>environmental costs. The two are <lb/>alternate calculations and should <lb/>not be added up. <lb/>35-75 <lb/>41-87 <lb/>Millennium Project <lb/>(2005) <lb/>70-130 <lb/>82-152 <lb/>Based on needed increases to ODA <lb/>2006-2015, including increased <lb/>donor commitments. Assumed <lb/>USD 28 billion of USD 65 billion in <lb/>ODA in 2002 went to MDGs based <lb/>on four case studies of individual <lb/>countries. <lb/>As Table 2 shows, the order of magnitude of past estimates is comparable to the estimates <lb/>of the current paper (once converted to 2009 USD). The 2001 Report of the High-Level Panel on <lb/>Financing for Development, chaired by former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo, gave a broad <lb/>estimate that a USD 50 billion increase in annual ODA flows was needed to achieve the goals <lb/>(United Nations, 2001). Devarajan et al. (2002) from the World Bank offered two separate <lb/>calculations that arrived at figures of roughly the same size, finding it would take a <lb/>USD 54 million to USD 62 million increase in ODA to achieve the poverty reduction goal, MDG1, <lb/>or a USD 35 billion to USD 72 billion increase to achieve the education, health and environmental <lb/>goals. They argued that these separate calculations could not be added up since reducing <lb/>poverty would go a long way towards improving health and education, and improving health <lb/>and education would also directly impact reducing income poverty. The 2005 report from the <lb/>Millennium Project chaired by Jeffrey Sachs proposed gradually increasing ODA by <lb/>USD 70 billion to USD 130 billion per year so that USD 189 billion in development co-operation <lb/>efforts was going towards MDG achievement by 2015. <lb/>Previous MDG cost estimates have faced criticism from a wide circle of observers, <lb/>including from some of those who were involved in the calculations themselves. Devarajan et al. <lb/>(2002) strictly cautioned that extreme care be used interpreting their own MDG cost estimates, <lb/>and that monetary inputs are not the only, and certainly not the most important, constraint <lb/>limiting MDG achievement. Reddy and Heuty (2005, 2006, 2008) also identified a series of <lb/>problems with the literature on costing the MDGs, including the lack of a consistent cost concept, <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>16 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>the absence of considerations about economies of scale in MDG achievement 3 <lb/>A common thread tying together many previous global MDG costing exercises is the <lb/>assumption that the main reason to quantify the cost of achieving the MDGs is to convince <lb/>donors to scale-up aid flows to developing countries. Clemens et al. (2007) pointed out that policy <lb/>proposals derived from previous costing estimates systematically misinterpret the simple and <lb/>approximate methods of global costing exercises when they argue for scaled-up aid flows. <lb/>Arguments to scale-up aid in response to the cost estimates rely heavily on unjustified <lb/>assumptions that improved policy environments, which alleviate aid effectiveness bottlenecks, <lb/>will be forthcoming and that constraints on absorptive capacity can be overcome easily. Easterly <lb/>(2006a, 2006b) also criticizes the assumption that increased foreign aid will lead to growth by <lb/>pointing out that arguments for scaled-up aid rely principally on outdated theories on the <lb/>relationship between aid and growth. <lb/>, and the lack of <lb/>robustness of estimates to the choice of assumptions. Other critics pointed out that MDG costing <lb/>misses the point of the MDGs themselves. For example, even one of the chief architects of the <lb/>MDGs, Jan Vandemoortele, former head of the poverty group at UNDP, pointed out that the <lb/>only correct answer to the question of how much will the MDGs cost is &quot; more &quot; (Vandemoortele <lb/>and Roy, 2005). <lb/>Another criticism of MDG cost estimates is the difficulty in assessing &quot;joint production&quot; of <lb/>the goals. Devarajan et al. (2002) recognised this by providing two separate measures of the cost <lb/>of achieving the MDGs, which they urged should not be combined so as to avoid &quot; double-<lb/>counting. &quot; Their first calculation measures only the resources needed to achieve the poverty <lb/>reduction goal of halving poverty. This calculation assumes that poverty reduction achieved by <lb/>increased growth sufficiently increases the demand and supply of health and education services <lb/>to ensure the achievement of the health, education and environmental-related goals, as well. <lb/>Devarajan et al. (2002) second calculation focused instead on the individual costs of achieving the <lb/>health, education and environmental costs separately. It then assumed that improving these <lb/>human development indicators has a consequent impact on incomes, thus ensuring the <lb/>achievement of the income poverty goal. <lb/>More recent studies have explicitly modelled the joint production of the goals at the <lb/>country level. For instance, the World Bank&apos;s MAMS model provides a general equilibrium <lb/>framework for countries to simulate the effect of improvements in one MDG on progress in <lb/>others (Bourguignon et al., 2008). While this approach may be much more satisfying for <lb/>modelling MDG costing, it is impossible to scale to the global level. It is also unrealistic in a <lb/>number of countries because of the large amount of country-specific data needed. Thus, for the <lb/>purposes of the present paper, the approach used by Devarajan et al. (2002) is followed and two <lb/>3. <lb/>Given the data limitations associated with trying to estimate the cost of MDG achievement of the global <lb/>level, many of the calculations in this paper (particularly those that are health and education <lb/>expenditure related) rely primarily on linear trend models. However, Annex 3 explores the possibility <lb/>that costs may change over time relative to countries&apos; levels of development. While this type of analysis <lb/>is preferred for country-level cost estimates, the calculations in Annex 3 indicate that cost differences <lb/>between countries at the aggregate level may cancel each other out, indicating that for the purposes of <lb/>this paper, linear extrapolation methods are acceptable. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>separate calculations are considered – one based on poverty reduction through growth, the other <lb/>based on the delivery of a number of developmental services 4 <lb/>II.2. Mobilising Domestic Resources for Development <lb/>. Double counting is avoided by <lb/>concentrating on one set of calculations for low-income countries, and another set for middle-<lb/>income countries; the rationale behind this approach is explained below. <lb/>The Monterrey Consensus (United Nations, 2003) recognises both the need for <lb/>developing countries to take responsibility for their own poverty reduction and for their partners <lb/>to support this endeavour with more open trade, aid and domestic policies that are coherent <lb/>with their international development aims. The Consensus underlines the importance for <lb/>development of tax, international investment, financial markets and private sector development, <lb/>aid, remittances, trade and debt. Crucially, the Monterrey consensus highlights mobilising <lb/>domestic financial resources as a critical action supporting the achievement of the Millennium <lb/>Development Goals. <lb/>While MDG costing exercises in the past may have placed the emphasis on aid as <lb/>financing for development, domestic resource mobilisation — i.e. taxes and domestic savings — <lb/>remains the primary source of sustainable MDG financing. Developing countries have made <lb/>some progress in improving tax collection in the past decade, yet half of sub-Saharan African <lb/>countries mobilise less than 17% of their GDP in tax revenues, below the minimum level <lb/>considered by the UN as necessary to achieve the MDGs. Several Asian and Latin American <lb/>countries exhibit even lower collection rates, in all tax categories. Moreover, in Africa, the <lb/>increase has been primarily driven by resource-related tax revenues in oil-producing countries. <lb/>Crisis-induced domestic revenue reductions threaten USD 12 billion of core public spending in <lb/>the poorest countries. <lb/>In terms of external resources, foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries <lb/>dominates in volume terms (USD 670 billion in 2010). Yet FDI and other capital inflows to <lb/>developing countries dropped by more than 50% in 2008 and are only slowly recovering. <lb/>Remittances (USD 325 billion in 2010), funds from foundations and climate change financing are <lb/>increasingly important, as are innovative sources of financing (such as the hotly debated taxes on <lb/>currency transactions, international air transport or carbon emissions as well as new actors such <lb/>as sovereign wealth funds and private equity). Although 2009 saw record levels of ODA from <lb/>OECD countries (USD 120 billion) and aid from non-OECD countries (USD 11 billion), aid is a <lb/>decreasing share of the overall financing for development picture. Bilateral aid comprises 60-70% <lb/>of total aid and is concentrated on poor countries, with least developed countries receiving four <lb/>times as much per capita as other recipients. Education, health, water and other social sectors <lb/>absorb nearly 40% of bilateral aid. Multilateral organisations, global programmes and funds <lb/>together contribute 30-40% of all aid. <lb/>4. <lb/>Other factors indeed influence the trajectory of poverty in individual countries, such as for example <lb/>food prices. However, for the back of the envelope calculations envisioned in this paper these impacts <lb/>are assumed to be accounted for by the real GDP per capita growth and projections that are used to <lb/>update the relevant poverty, education, or health expenditure figures. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>18 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>Tax revenues have been rising across the developing world over the last decade. The <lb/>average tax ratio has been increasing in Africa, arguably the most critical region to MDG <lb/>achievement, since the beginning of the 1990s. The tax ratio is defined as the total of all collected <lb/>taxes expressed as share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This ratio is important because it tells <lb/>how much tax revenue is available to a country&apos;s government, taking into account the size of the <lb/>country&apos;s economy. The increase in the average tax ratio across Africa implies that many of the <lb/>continent&apos;s economies have made noticeable progress in collecting taxes over the last two <lb/>decades. Figure 1 plots the evolution of (un-weighted) average of tax shares on the African <lb/>continent as a whole and its breakdown into different income categories. The 2010 African <lb/>Economic Outlook (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010) observed that an increase in revenue <lb/>collected on resource extraction activities in some countries has largely driven the observed <lb/>increase in the average tax share. <lb/>Figure 1: Average African Tax Share <lb/>Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010). <lb/>Classifying African countries according to their level of income shows three different <lb/>trends in tax ratios. The tax share of upper-middle-income countries is slowly converging with <lb/>the tax share of OECD countries, to nearly 35%. Lower-middle income countries have a tax share <lb/>comparable to other countries from other continents in the same income category, over 25% at <lb/>pre-crisis levels. Low-income countries have a much lower ratio, below 20%. <lb/>Taxes per capita correspond to the total of all collected taxes divided by the number of <lb/>inhabitants. In general, taxes per capita have been increasing in Africa throughout the last two <lb/>decades, although in low-income countries (LICs) the increase has been modest. Taxes per capita <lb/>provide an intuitive measure of the amount of tax revenue available on average to the <lb/>government for each inhabitant. In other words, it is the amount of tax money available for the <lb/>government to spend on everything ranging from building roads to providing public education <lb/>on average for each inhabitant. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>19 <lb/>Figure 2: Taxes per capita 1996-2009 <lb/>Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010). <lb/>Large differences remain across African countries in the levels of tax revenues per capita. <lb/>In 2009 countries such as Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Guinea <lb/>Bissau collected taxes per capita as low as USD 35 per inhabitant. It is noteworthy that albeit <lb/>remaining very low, this amount has been rising steadily. However, it is difficult to envision any <lb/>sort of consequential public service delivery with an annual public budget corresponding to an <lb/>average of USD 35 for each inhabitant. At the other end of the spectrum, in countries such as <lb/>Equatorial Guinea, Libya and the Seychelles, taxes reach over USD 3 000 per inhabitant. In 2008 <lb/>Equatorial Guinea collected as much as USD 5 317 per inhabitant. In 2009 this amount had <lb/>dropped back to USD 3 806. <lb/>Figure 3: Absolute Resource Taxes <lb/>Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010). <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>20 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>As highlighted by AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010), the fiscal performance of the middle-<lb/>income African countries is highly linked to the international prices of natural resources. The <lb/>effect of fluctuating resource prices since 2008 and onwards throughout the crisis can be seen in <lb/>Figure 3, which shows the fiscal revenue from resource taxes. <lb/>The degree to which these domestic resources can be scaled-up can be broadly estimated <lb/>given some general assumptions. It has been well documented, including by the African Economic <lb/>Outlook (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010) and the Perspective on Global Development 2012 (OECD, <lb/>2011) that there is increasing scope for mobilising domestic resources in developing countries. <lb/>The next section, following a summary of the methods used to calculate the aggregate costs for <lb/>achieving the MDGs, describes tax effort calculations (Piancastelli, 2001; Bird et al., 2004 and <lb/>2008). The section also discusses how these calculations can be used to make reasonable <lb/>estimates for the scope of scaling-up tax revenues in developing countries in order to increase <lb/>domestic resources available for MDG financing. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>21 <lb/>III. METHODS FOR COSTING MDG ACHIEVEMENT <lb/>AND MEASURING DOMESTIC RESOURCES <lb/>This section examines three types of calculations on which this paper rests. The section <lb/>first looks at the &quot; financing gap &quot; calculation, which is used to calculate the amount of additional <lb/>capital an economy needs to maintain a target growth rate. This target growth rate will be shown <lb/>to differ for each country according to the amount of growth in per capita income or <lb/>consumption that will be needed to halve the number of people living on a dollar a day, <lb/>assuming distribution-neutral growth. <lb/>As shown in the previous section and as pointed out by Devarajan et al. (2002), the <lb/> &quot; financing gap &quot; calculation should not be aggregated with other calculations of health and <lb/>education costs to avoid &quot; double counting &quot; due to the possible &quot; joint production &quot; of MDG <lb/>achievement. Unlike Devarajan et al. (2002), however, this paper considers an alternative poverty <lb/>gap-based estimate of the cost for achieving MDG 1 which, this paper argues, can be aggregated <lb/>with the health and education cost estimates. This alternative measure will be shown to be <lb/>equivalent to a cash transfer that aims to provide enough income support to halve the number of <lb/>people living on less than a dollar a-day by 2015. In this way, like Devarajan et al. (2002), this <lb/>paper offers two separate approaches for calculating the cost of MDG achievement. <lb/>This section thus looks secondly at how to estimate the cost of MDG achievement through <lb/>scaling-up service delivery in order to avoid the &quot; double counting &quot; issue highlighted in the <lb/>previous section. The cost of MDG achievement is the sum of estimates of the &quot; poverty gap &quot; to <lb/>measure the cash transfer needed to achieve MDG 1, of estimates of education expenditures <lb/>needed to achieve MDGs 2 and 3 and of estimates of health expenditures needed to achieve <lb/>MDGs 4, 5, and 6. Finally, this section explores how estimates of tax effort can be used to <lb/>calculate how much government revenues could be increased through improved tax collection to <lb/>meet the needs identified by the MDG cost estimates. <lb/>III.1. Overcoming the Limits of the &quot; Financing Gap &quot; <lb/>MDG 1 is expected to be met because the Millennium Declaration posed the MDGs as <lb/>global goals, not individual country goals. Thanks in large part to strong growth in China, world <lb/>poverty will be halved by 2015. However, if the MDGs are monitored at the country level, the <lb/>simplest way to disaggregate responsibility for achieving the global goal is by expecting each <lb/>country to halve their own poverty headcount themselves. From this point of view, a number of <lb/>countries will still be lagging behind on MDG 1 by 2015. To estimate the amount of additional <lb/>resources needed by 2015 to achieve a poverty headcount ratio that is half of 1990 levels, this <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>22 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>paper relies on two very different approaches. This first section looks at the &quot; financing gap &quot; <lb/>calculation that has underpinned many of the previous MDG calculations. <lb/>The &quot; financing gap &quot; refers to the difference between the investment requirements an <lb/>economy needs to achieve a targeted growth rate and the actual investment resources available <lb/>through domestic or external sources of financing. The gap itself is calculated using a simple <lb/>Harrod-Domar growth model that defines a mechanistic relationship between capital and <lb/>growth. Many of the criticisms of previous MDG estimates cite drawbacks in the Harrod-Domar <lb/>growth model and in particular in its later variation, the &quot; two-gap &quot; growth model, formulated <lb/>by Chenery and Strout (1966). <lb/>The workhorse model of early development economics, developed by Harrod (1939) and <lb/>Domar (1946) and used for much of the post-war period, permits calculating the amount of <lb/>additional resources an economy needs to obtain a specified target growth rate given savings <lb/>rates and a fixed capital-output ratio. The approach gained appeal in the immediate post-war <lb/>period as a useful way to study temporary shortages of capital, such as that experienced by <lb/>Europe during its reconstruction under the Marshall Plan. As a way of quantifying the amount of <lb/>capital needed to generate growth, the Harrod-Domar model helped quantify not only the costs <lb/>of European reconstruction, but also the investments needed to stimulate growth under socialist <lb/>five-year plans, such as those prepared by China, India and the Soviet Union. <lb/>An appealing feature of the Harrod-Domar model was its compatibility with the notion <lb/>that capital accumulation was a precondition for a country&apos;s &quot; take-off &quot; into economic <lb/>development, such as Rostow (1956, 1959) theorised. This &quot; take-off &quot; can be delivered as a &quot; big <lb/>push &quot; of externally financed investment needed to spark industrialisation, as envisioned by <lb/>Rosenstein-Rodan (1943, 1961). The intuition that capital accumulation was a key constraint to <lb/>economic development conveniently lent itself to models justifying foreign aid. In the early post-<lb/>war period, the principal justification for foreign aid to developing countries relied on the belief <lb/>that aid could raise a country&apos;s growth rate to a level sufficiently high to ensure Rostow&apos;s &quot; take-<lb/>off &quot; in order to push the country out of a poverty trap and propel it into a pattern of self-<lb/>sustaining growth. Chenery and Strout (1966) thus re-formulated the Harrod-Domar model as <lb/>the &quot; two-gap &quot; model, explicitly in terms of two types of financing gap, a &quot; savings-investment <lb/>gap &quot; and a &quot; trade gap, &quot; measuring the ability of countries to maintain target growth rates given <lb/>their savings rates and their trade balances. Importantly, these gaps were theorised to be filled by <lb/>foreign aid (Chenery and Strout, 1966). <lb/>The main problem with using financing gap models to cost the MDGs is not the models <lb/>themselves but the assumption that the gap should be filled by aid alone. For instance, reflecting <lb/>on some of the criticism of earlier studies that argue aid should be scaled-up, Guillaumont and <lb/>Guillaumont-Jeanneney (2007) pointedly observed: &quot; The main argument for doubling aid is not <lb/>simply to fill a financial gap, but to push countries out of the stagnation trap which will be <lb/>impossible to escape otherwise. [...] The criticism then is an attack against the idea of a trap and <lb/>its big push corollary. &quot; The assumption that a &quot; big push &quot; of aid stimulates growth in a <lb/>mechanistic way is problematic and has been cited as a limitation of the previous MDG costing <lb/>exercises detailed in Section II. For instance, Easterly (2006a, 2006b) pointed out that this &quot; big <lb/>push &quot; theory ignores a number of issues that are crucial to making aid effective, such as <lb/>institutional quality and absorptive capacity. With regard to this critique, Guillaumont and <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>23 <lb/>Guillaumont-Jeanneney (2007) noted, &quot; Other critical opinions or reservations – mostly with <lb/>regard to the notion of absorptive capacity – are intended to highlight all the reasons why <lb/>increased aid is likely to be useless, wasted or even harmful. &quot; In other words, the criticism is <lb/>aimed not at the financing gap model itself, but rather at the extension that it should be filled by <lb/>aid. <lb/>Criticisms notwithstanding, it is possible to shed the assumption that the big push should <lb/>come from aid alone and still harvest the financing gap calculations based on a Harrod-Domar <lb/>model as a useful construct. This is particularly true if the purpose is to obtain an approximate <lb/>size of resources – whether domestic or external in origin – that would be needed to achieve a <lb/>target growth rate. Importantly, the financing gap calculations themselves do not have to <lb/>distinguish whether additional resources come from either aid increases or from elsewhere. In <lb/>fact, the simplicity of the model used in this paper may be its strength: the only determinant of <lb/>how investment resources are turned into growth in this model is the mechanistic relationship <lb/>between capital and output, labelled θ, the incremental capital output ratio. For the purposes of <lb/>this paper, this ratio is determined by how much investment has led to growth in output over the <lb/>period since 1990. Hence, it varies greatly between different countries, and it is loosely related to <lb/>the effectiveness of policies and institutions, including the business climate, and the historical <lb/>experiences of each of the countries under consideration. <lb/>To determine the target growth rate that will be used for this paper&apos;s calculations, the first <lb/>step consists of estimating how much consumption or income growth will be needed to raise <lb/>average incomes high enough to halve poverty by 2015. It is therefore assumed that inequality <lb/>stays constant over the period, and the most recent distributional parameters can be used. These <lb/>parameters define the points along each country&apos;s Lorenz curve. Methods developed by Datt <lb/>(1998) can be applied to determine how much growth in mean incomes or consumption <lb/>contributes to poverty reduction. Once the target growth rate needed to achieve the poverty <lb/>reduction target is obtained, it can be plugged into a simple Harrod-Domar model that then <lb/>determines the amount of resources needed to achieve the target growth rate, y, as a function of <lb/>the following variables: <lb/>í µí±¦ í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±(í µí± í µí±í µí±£í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí¼, í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼, í µí±í µí±í µí±, í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ) <lb/>Using the 2009 values for savings rates, aid, FDI, and population growth, and the <lb/>estimated value for θ, the incremental capital-output ratio, the only variable left unidentified is <lb/>the &quot; additional resources &quot; term. Terms can therefore be re-arranged to calculate the amount of <lb/>additional resources needed. 5 <lb/>III.2. MDG Achievement through Service Delivery <lb/>The financing gap calculation described above provides an estimate of the size of <lb/>additional resources national economies would need to raise their growth rates sufficiently to <lb/>achieve MDG1. As mentioned in Section II, the literature argues that to avoid &quot; double counting &quot; <lb/>5. <lb/>For a full explanation of these calculations, please see Annex 1. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">© OECD 2011 <lb/>of cost estimates, these resources cannot be added together with the costs to achieve the other <lb/>MDGs. Indeed, particularly at the aggregate level, it is very difficult to disentangle the &quot; joint <lb/>production &quot; of the MDGs: lower poverty improves health and education outcomes, and better <lb/>health and education can lower poverty as well. In addition, reducing poverty by increasing <lb/>growth is fundamentally different from improving health outcomes by increasing health <lb/>expenditures and improving education by increasing educational expenditures. Similarly, there <lb/>is a fundamental difference between reducing poverty by increasing growth and reducing <lb/>poverty by redistributing income to poor people: once incomes improve through the growth <lb/>process, they are much more likely to fall back significantly even though their growth may slow. <lb/>Conversely, education, health expenditure and transfers to reduce poverty need to be <lb/>maintained, or people will not remain healthy, children will not stay in school, and transfer <lb/>recipients may fall back into poverty. While transfer programmes can potentially contribute to <lb/>growth by altering the trajectories of the individuals and families they are allocated to, it is <lb/>reasonable to assume that their withdrawal typically leads to significant social and development <lb/>setbacks. <lb/>In other words, the investment requirements needed to catalyse growth – such as those <lb/>estimated by the financing gap calculation described above can be considered one-off <lb/>expenditures needed to drive up growth rates in the lead up to 2015. Once sufficiently high per <lb/>capita incomes are achieved, at the heart of the financing gap calculation is Rostow&apos;s (1956) <lb/>assumption that economic take-off would lead to a period of self-sustaining growth. Thereafter <lb/>additional resources should not be required beyond those produced by the economy itself. While <lb/>this may be considered a simplistic assumption, it is no less naïve than the assumption that <lb/>capital turns into output in a mechanistic way. Again, for the sake of this paper, it is sufficient for <lb/>helping to gauge the order of magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs. In contrast, <lb/>the provision of services to achieve the MDGs can be treated as recurring, non-overlapping, <lb/>expenditures: income transfers, health and education expenditures can and should be added up, <lb/>and they need to be maintained beyond 2015 to secure MDG achievement. This implies another <lb/>set of simplifying assumptions, particularly with respect to how expenditures are distributed and <lb/>how recurring costs may change over time. Importantly, however, keeping these implicit <lb/>assumptions in mind, these simple estimates allow us to gauge the order of magnitude of the <lb/>cost of MDG achievement that takes the form of service delivery. <lb/>The rest of this section looks first at the income transfers, second at the education <lb/>expenditures and third and finally at the health expenditures that are needed to achieve the <lb/>MDGs through service provision. Unlike the financing gap calculations, income transfers are <lb/>assumed not to directly affect health and education outcomes. Indeed, the transfers calculated <lb/>specifically target the poor who are the closest to the poverty line and provide them additional <lb/>income to move them just above the poverty line. Consequently, the effect of poverty reduction <lb/>on health and education outcomes is significantly less than it would be if poverty declined due to <lb/>distributional-neutral broad-based growth, such as is assumed by the financing gap calculation. <lb/></note>

			<body>question. Instead of looking at how much additional resources are needed to stimulate growth, <lb/>the extra income the poor need to halve the number of poor by 2015 is estimated. The poverty <lb/>gap (Foster et al., 1984) measure is a poverty indicator that measures the mean proportionate <lb/>shortfall (z-yi) from the poverty line (z) for a given population (n): <lb/>í µí±í µí±í µí±£í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±í µí± = <lb/>1 <lb/>í µí± <lb/>� <lb/>(í µí± § − í µí±¦ í µí± ) <lb/>í µí± § <lb/> * í µí°¼( <lb/>í µí± <lb/>í µí±=1 <lb/>í µí±¦ í µí± &lt; í µí± §) <lb/>Multiplying the poverty gap by the poverty line (z) and the total population (n) thus gives <lb/>an aggregate measure of the total transfer required to eliminate poverty in a given country for a <lb/>given distribution. The poverty gap is also easily computable from the parameters of the Lorenz <lb/>curve the poverty headcount, mean income, and the poverty line, z, following Datt (1998). <lb/>The poverty gap associated with the mean income and poverty headcount obtained <lb/>under a &quot; business as usual &quot; growth scenario through 2015 -based on the most recent World <lb/>Economic Outlook projections from the IMF-can be compared to the poverty gap of a distribution <lb/>associated with the target growth scenario calculated for the financing gap calculation above. <lb/>The difference between the predicted and the targeted poverty gaps in 2015 can then be used to <lb/>calculate the aggregate transfer that will be needed every year to keep sufficient numbers of poor <lb/>people out of poverty to assure that the poverty headcount is half its 1990 levels: <lb/>í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± = �í µí±í µí°º 2015 í µí°¼í µí±í µí°¹ í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±|í µí¼ − í µí±í µí°º 2015 í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡|í µí¼ � * í µí± * í µí± § <lb/>2. Calculating Expenditure to Meet Education-related Goals (MDGs 2 &amp; 3) <lb/>The cost of achieving universal primary education is estimated using the method <lb/>proposed by Delamonica et al. (2001). Based on country-specific unit cost estimation of primary <lb/>education, this study projected the annual additional cost of reaching a net enrolment ratio equal <lb/>to 100% for primary education by 2015. According to the definition of the United Nations&apos; <lb/>Statistics Division, the net enrolment rate (NER) in primary education is the number of children <lb/>of official primary school age who are enrolled in primary education as a percentage of the total <lb/>children of the official school age population. Some authors, e.g. Glewwe and Zhao (2006), argue <lb/>that keeping children enrolled in primary education until completion is a major constraint for <lb/>universal completion of primary education, for instance when there exist outside options for <lb/>children to enter the labour force or contribute to work at home. However, the simplifying <lb/>assumption made here is that achieving universal enrolment in primary education would lead to <lb/>universal completion of primary education if other MDGs are met. For instance, if poverty is also <lb/>reduced significantly, it can be argued that the reservation wage available to children who do not <lb/>complete primary schooling is less likely to be significant. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>26 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>The NER data available for years 1999-2009 and data for public expenditure 6 <lb/>To calculate the number of students to be schooled, two hypotheses are made about the <lb/>future baseline trend of net enrolment rates.

Population census and projections are taken <lb/>from the United Nations&apos; World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision (United Nations, <lb/>Population Division). GDP per capita is taken from the IMF World Economic Outlook data, April <lb/>2011 Edition. To assess how much education expenditure needs to be spent to achieve universal <lb/>primary education, baseline spending on education must first be estimated under reasonable <lb/>assumptions about future net enrolment rates. To project public expenditure, real public <lb/>expenditure per student on primary education until 2015 is assumed to remain the same as in <lb/>2009. Differences thus exist across countries, as there are countries and regions where the <lb/>expenditure per student is higher than in others. These differences can reflect variations in the <lb/>cost of providing a constant quality of education or, alternatively, of variations in the quality of <lb/>primary education across regions and countries. It is beyond the scope of this paper to separate <lb/>these two effects because the quality of education is not explicitly an MDG, while universal <lb/>primary enrolment is. <lb/>7 <lb/>í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±í µí°¸í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ × í µí° ¶ℎí µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± 2015, 6−11 í µí±¦í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± <lb/>while an alternative scenario assumes that the NERs follow <lb/>their linear trend during the preceding decade: <lb/>Public expenditure under the baseline and alternative scenarios is then calculated as <lb/>follows: <lb/>í µí°¸í µí±¥í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¢í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ × í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± í µí±¡ 2009 <lb/>The amount of public expenditure needed to achieve 100% net primary enrolment in 2015 <lb/>can be calculated as follows: <lb/>í µí°¸í µí±¥í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¢í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí°·í µí°º = í µí° ¶ℎí µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± 2015, 6−11 í µí±¦í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± × í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± í µí±¡ 2009 <lb/>This allows the calculation of the additional educational expenditure needed in both <lb/>scenarios.

Calculating Expenditure to Meet Health-related Goals (MDGs 4, 5, &amp; 6) <lb/>Health-related MDGs include reducing child mortality (MDG 4), improving maternal <lb/>health (MDG 5), and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other pandemic diseases (MDG 6). <lb/>Devarajan et al. (2002) argued that adding up the costs of achieving the different health goals <lb/>could lead to their overestimation because the different goals are highly interconnected. On the <lb/>other hand, it can be argued that there is also a risk of underestimating these costs considering <lb/>the weak relation between public spending and health outcomes as shown by Filmer et al. (2000). <lb/>According to the World Health Organization (2010), ensuring access to the types of interventions <lb/>and treatments needed to address MDGs 4, 5 and 6 requires on average &quot; little more than <lb/>USD 60 per capita [annually] by 2015. &quot; <lb/>Of course, it is legitimate to wonder how realistic it is to assume that USD 60 per capita <lb/>would be the amount of health expenditure required to meet health-related MDGs in all <lb/>developing countries. For instance, calculations that are explained further in Annex 3 show that <lb/>in low income countries the effect on child mortality of increases in health is insignificant. For <lb/>lower-middle income countries, in contrast, the effect is strong and very significant while for <lb/>upper-middle income countries, the effect is somewhat strong and still very significant. This S-<lb/>shaped health input-outcome relationship is consistent with the literature (see a discussion in <lb/>Klasen and Lange, 2011). The implication is that for low-income countries, it is not even clear that <lb/>expenditure on top of USD 60 per capita would necessarily lead to health outcomes compatible <lb/>with attaining health-related MDGs essentially because of absorptive capacity issues. As for <lb/>middle income countries, USD 60 per capita is probably an underestimate of the cost of meeting <lb/>health-related MDGs in upper-middle countries. The reasons are twofold: the cost of health <lb/>provision is correlated with the general price level and health outcomes become more expensive <lb/>to attain the more advanced in health a country gets. Calculations explained in Annex 3 lead to <lb/>estimates of a USD 83.4 per capita only to meet the child mortality MDG (MDG 4) in lower-<lb/>middle income countries, and USD 288.1 per capita in upper middle income countries. <lb/>This paper, however, sticks to WHO&apos;s USD 60 per capita estimate not only because the <lb/>virtue of its simplicity and transparency but also because it is questionable whether health-<lb/>related MDGs are as meaningful in middle-income countries as in lower-income countries. In <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>28 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>middle-income countries, redistribution and offering access to health services to poor people <lb/>may be a priority more in the actual spirit of MDGs rather than necessarily raising the overall <lb/>expenditure per capita for the population as a whole. Such priority may not actually require <lb/>spending per capita significantly above USD 60 per capita. What this discussion implies, <lb/>however, is that more effort has to be devoted to understanding and addressing inequalities with <lb/>respect to health outcomes in middle income countries. <lb/>With the USD 60 per capita target maintained, to calculate how much additional <lb/>expenditure will be required globally to meet this threshold, baseline spending on health first <lb/>needs to be estimated under reasonable assumptions about future spending. The current level of <lb/>government spending on health is projected up to 2015 for 128 developing countries for which <lb/>data is available. Data for per capita total expenditure on health come from the WHO. IMF World <lb/>Economic Outlook data, April 2011 edition forecasts are used for GDP growth projections between <lb/>2011 and 2015. These costs per inhabitant are multiplied by population projections coming from <lb/>the United Nations&apos; World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision (United Nations, Population <lb/>Division). <lb/>Two different baseline scenarios are analysed: <lb/>i) Linear Scenario: initial per capita expenditure for health in 2009 8 <lb/>ii) Constant Scenario: initial per capita expenditure for health in 2009 remains constant. <lb/>grows at the same rate <lb/>as per capita real GDP growth projection for each year; <lb/>The linear scenario can be thought of as a more realistic estimate of the growth of future <lb/>expenditure while the constant scenario serves more as a minimum estimate. Indeed, <lb/>calculations explained in more details in Annex 3 show that the elasticity of health expenditure <lb/>with respect to GDP while positive and statistically significant is below 1 for all developing <lb/>countries in general. For low income countries it stands at 0.81, for lower middle-income <lb/>countries at 0.89 and for upper-middle income countries at 0.95. The richer the country the more <lb/>elastic is the health expenditure with respects to GDP. Thus, the linear scenario probably <lb/>overestimates the growth health expenditure in low-income countries and therefore <lb/>underestimating their corresponding gap by 2015. Further, given that these elasticities are not <lb/>very different from unity, the constant scenario is clearly underestimating health expenditure by <lb/>2015 and thus overestimating the gap by then. <lb/>The simple calculations made are as follows: <lb/>í µí°¸í µí±¥í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¢í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± 2015 × í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± í µí±¡ í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ <lb/>Next, how much total expenditure is needed to achieve the USD 60 per capita threshold <lb/>must be assessed.

Estimating the Scope for Scaling-up Domestic Resources Mobilisation <lb/>Once estimates of the costs to achieve the MDGs – calculated as the &quot; financing gap &quot; or as <lb/>the cost of service provision as defined in the two preceding sections – are available, a natural <lb/>step consists in estimating the degree to which countries can scale-up the mobilisation of their <lb/>own domestic resources to finance the local achievement of MDGs.

Their tax effort index is calculated to compare predicted tax revenues to <lb/>actual tax revenues and to estimate how much extra tax revenue may be collected if a country <lb/>improves tax collection. <lb/>Empirically, taxes as a share of GDP can be shown to depend on the economy&apos;s level of <lb/>development, on the share of the economy that is formal or industrialised and on the openness of <lb/>the economy to trade.

RESULTS OF COST ESTIMATES AND DOMESTIC RESOURCE <lb/>MEASUREMENT <lb/>This section presents the figures that lead us to postulate that the cost for achieving the <lb/>MDGs equals approximately USD 120 billion in additional resources annually. It is important to <lb/>note that this amount is roughly twice the amount of domestic resources that developing <lb/>countries are estimated to be able to raise through increased tax revenues. Moreover, there is a <lb/>mismatch between the countries where additional domestic resources can typically be mobilised <lb/>and where the financing needs to meet the MDGs are. While half the required financing is <lb/>estimated to be needed in middle-income countries, most of the USD 64 billion in potential <lb/>increase in domestic resource mobilisation (potential increase in tax revenues) is concentrated in <lb/>middle-income countries that are not lagging behind on MDG progress. <lb/>This section first reviews the estimated cost of achieving the MDGs through filling the <lb/>financing gap. Second, this section looks at the estimated cost of achieving the MDGs through <lb/>increased delivery of development services in the form of expenditure increases on cash <lb/>transfers, health and education. Third, the results of the tax effort calculations are then reviewed <lb/>and used to show why, although substantial, scope for increased tax collection will have little <lb/>immediate impact on MDG achievement. Finally, this section explains why the financing gap <lb/>calculations are used for low-income countries while the service provision calculations are used <lb/>for middle-income countries. <lb/>IV.1. The Cost of Filling the &quot; Financing Gap &quot; <lb/>Table 3 shows the results of the financing gap calculations by region and by income <lb/>group. Taken at face value, the financing gap calculations reflect a need for more than <lb/>USD 200 billion in additional resources annually to achieve the MDGs. The bulk of these <lb/>additional resources is estimated to be required in middle-income countries. However, as <lb/>explained in Section I, this paper relies on the financing gap calculations for estimating the cost <lb/>estimate of achieving the MDGs in low-income countries, where a financing gap exists. <lb/>Therefore, out of the more than USD 200 billion financing gap worldwide, only the <lb/>USD 62 billion gap in low-income countries is considered to be a credible estimate of the cost of <lb/>achieving the MDGs in these countries. This is for a number of reasons explained below. <lb/>The East Asia and the South Asia regions have minimal additional capital requirements <lb/>to achieve the target growth rates needed to halve poverty, reflecting the significant progress <lb/>these regions have already made on MDG 1 over the last decade. However, the Latin America <lb/>and Caribbean and the sub-Saharan Africa regions require significant amounts of additional <lb/>capital to achieve enough growth to halve poverty. The amount of total additional resources <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>31 <lb/>required at the global level is estimated in this paper to be significantly larger than the amounts <lb/>estimated in previous studies, such as Devarajan et al. (2002). This is primarily because this paper <lb/>calculates the financing gap for a broader sample of countries. In Devarajan et al. (ibid.), countries <lb/>that are not on track to achieve the MDGs but for which increases in aid will not significantly <lb/>impact growth rates – for instance, Colombia, Venezuela and Haiti – are explicitly excluded from <lb/>calculations. The argument is that these countries include a number of countries that receive <lb/>small amounts of aid relative to GDP and have relatively high average income or consumption <lb/>but highly unequal distributions of incomes and thus a high number of poor. <lb/>Table 3: The Total Additional Capital Requirement Needed to Achieve MDG 1 <lb/>Growth Targets (i.e. the &quot; Financing Gap &quot; ) as Estimated by a Simple Harrod-Domar Model <lb/>(USD billion) <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>East Asia &amp; Pacific <lb/>.13 <lb/>.13 <lb/>Europe &amp; Central Asia <lb/>7.6 <lb/>10 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean <lb/>130 <lb/>170 <lb/>Middle East &amp; North Africa <lb/>8.3 <lb/>8.5 <lb/>South Asia <lb/>.94 <lb/>1.9 <lb/>Sub-Saharan Africa <lb/>72 <lb/>89 <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Low income <lb/>37 <lb/>62 <lb/>Lower-middle income <lb/>70 <lb/>78 <lb/>Upper-middle income <lb/>110 <lb/>140 <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>Countries where reasonable increases of ODA will be inconsequential to growth are left <lb/>in the sample intentionally; the focus of this paper is on the total amount of resources needed, <lb/>whether those resources come from aid or other sources of finrancing. Doing so also highlights a <lb/>key result of the present exercise: those countries with the greatest growth financing needs are <lb/>indeed those countries where increasing aid has the smallest effect on growth. Leaving in such <lb/>countries drives up the cost of meeting MDG 1 and may go against the original spirit of MDGs <lb/>that were meant to be met at the global level, however. Indeed, Colombia and Venezuela have <lb/>neither the largest number of poor people in the world nor even the largest share of poor in their <lb/>populations. These economies simply are some of the most unequal and have been historically <lb/>some of the least responsive to investment and aid as captured by the long-term values of the <lb/>incremental capital-output ratio estimated over the period 1990-2015. <lb/>The role of inequality cannot be overstated in the explanation of the large financing gaps <lb/>in Latin American countries. In addition to the lack of productivity of capital investment <lb/>reflected in a high incremental capital-output ratio, these countries also face a very low growth <lb/>elasticity of poverty reduction. This is because high inequality mutes the impact of growth on <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>32 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>poverty reduction (Bourguignon, 2003). Taking Colombia as an example, out of USD 1 million <lb/>growth in national income, on average only USD 8 800 goes to the poorest 10%, whereas <lb/>USD 462 000 to the richest 10%. In other words, to get USD 8 800 to the poorest, the simple <lb/>Harrod-Domar model used in this paper requires that USD 462 000 be granted to the richest <lb/>through growth because it postulates distribution-neutral growth. <lb/>Nonetheless, many of these countries have significantly high income per capita and could <lb/>conceivably reduce poverty through redistribution. The needs in upper-middle-income countries <lb/>and in much of Latin America stem less from the absolute needs of poor populations than they <lb/>do from the inefficient market structure of those countries – captured by high incremental <lb/>capital-output ratios and low savings rates and/or by high inequality, which is reflected by <lb/>relatively high mean incomes but large numbers of poor people. Obviously, using fiscal policy to <lb/>make growth more inclusive and combating poverty through public spending targeted at lower-<lb/>income groups may be more propitious than reducing poverty through increased growth in the <lb/>current conditions prevailing in these countries. This possibility is considered in the following <lb/>section, which looks at the cost of income transfers to the poor that could help achieve MDG 1 as <lb/>part of a broader programme of service delivery. <lb/>IV.2.The Cost of Development Service Provision <lb/>1. Income Transfers to the Poor to Fill the Poverty Gap <lb/>The additional resources needed to increase average incomes enough to reduce poverty <lb/>by the amount required to achieve MDG 1 are, in many cases, substantial. Of course, these <lb/>calculations are highly troublesome, for a number of the reasons outlined above. Interestingly, <lb/>contrary to the results of the growth exercise in Section A, the poverty gap calculation shows that <lb/>the greatest absolute need of the poor – in terms of the amount by which their incomes are on <lb/>average below the poverty line – is in sub-Saharan Africa and is spread more or less evenly <lb/>between low-income and lower-middle-income countries. <lb/>This transfer is calculated for the 35 countries that are not on track to achieve MDG 1 <lb/>according to the financing gap calculations above, where the distributional data and the IMF <lb/>projections are available. As shown in Table 4, the total aggregate transfer to the poor required to <lb/>achieve MDG 1 is estimated to be USD 9.8 billion at purchasing power parity terms (that is, <lb/>USD 4.9 billion at market exchange rates). It is important to note, however, that these transfers <lb/>are hypothesised to be perfectly targeted and do not include administration or transaction costs. <lb/>Accordingly, they represent an extreme lower bound to the amount of additional resources <lb/>required to achieve MDG 1. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>33 <lb/>Table 4: Shortfall in the Income of the Poor between Baseline and Target Scenarios <lb/>(USD billion) <lb/>Aggregate transfer to poor needed <lb/>Market exchange rates Purchasing Power Parity <lb/>Europe &amp; Central Asia <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean <lb/>0.6 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Middle East &amp; North Africa <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>Sub-Saharan Africa <lb/>4.2 <lb/>8.6 <lb/>Total <lb/>4.9 <lb/>9.8 <lb/>Low income <lb/>2.4 <lb/>4.9 <lb/>Lower-middle income <lb/>2.3 <lb/>4.6 <lb/>Upper-middle income <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>Total <lb/>4.9 <lb/>9.8 <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>The financing gap calculations assume poverty is to be reduced through distribution-<lb/>neutral growth that, in turn, spurs production of the other human development outcomes <lb/>captured by the rest of the MDGs. In contrast, the poverty gap calculations approach poverty <lb/>reduction in a more limited manner. Reaching MDG 1 through the targeted cash transfers <lb/>implied by such calculations suggests individual transfers going to the poor people who are <lb/>closest to the poverty line. These transfers would therefore go only to smallest number of people <lb/>necessary to ensure that the headcount ratio is halved. All other things remaining equal, this type <lb/>of transfer would actually increase inequality. Indeed, the poor as a group – i.e. those still poor <lb/>after the transfer – would be on average more deeply poor – i.e. farther from the poverty line – <lb/>than the poor as a group were before. Accordingly, this estimate is a lower bound on the order of <lb/>magnitude of the costs of MDG 1 achievement, rather than a concrete proposal for MDG 1 <lb/>achievement through cash transfers. <lb/>2. Achieving Universal Primary Enrolment through Education Expenditure <lb/>Under the hypothesis that government expenditure on education stays constant and all <lb/>increases come from additional resources, amongst 90 countries 10 <lb/>10. Amongst these 90 countries, there are 23 low-income countries, 33 lower-middle-income countries and <lb/>33 upper-middle-income countries. Equatorial Guinea (High Income) is also included in the dataset. <lb/>for which data is available, the <lb/>baseline projection shows that as much as an additional USD 8.8 billion needs to be spent in 2015 <lb/>to achieve universal primary education. As shown in Table 5, upper-middle-income countries <lb/>have the largest expenditure shortfall, USD 5.5 million, followed by lower-middle-income <lb/>countries with USD 2.2 million. The region that requires the highest increase in spending <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>34 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>compared to baseline expenditure is Latin America and Caribbean with USD 2.9 billion. This is <lb/>predominantly due to the higher cost of primary education per student. Sub-Saharan Africa is <lb/>the second costliest region in terms of achieving universal primary education, with an <lb/>expenditure shortfall of USD 2.3 billion. The East Asia and Pacific region follows close behind, <lb/>with a USD 1.3 billion shortfall. The sub-Saharan Africa and the Latin American and Caribbean <lb/>regions together represent about 59% of all additional spending that would be required in 2015 <lb/>to achieve universal enrolment in primary school. <lb/>Table 5: Additional Resources Needed to Achieve Universal Primary Education in 2015 <lb/>(2009 USD billion) <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Sub-Saharan Africa <lb/>1.8 <lb/>2.3 <lb/>Middle East &amp; North Africa <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>Europe &amp; Central Asia <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>East Asia &amp; Pacific <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>South Asia <lb/>0.2 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean <lb/>2.3 <lb/>2.9 <lb/>Total <lb/>6.9 <lb/>8.8 <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Low income <lb/>0.6 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Lower-middle income <lb/>1.1 <lb/>2.2 <lb/>Upper-middle income <lb/>5.3 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>Total <lb/>6.9 <lb/>8.8 <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>Under the alternative scenario, where NERs follow their linear trend during the <lb/>preceding decade, the additional spending required in 2015 to achieve universal primary <lb/>education is estimated to be USD 6.9 billion. This projection shows that a continuation of current <lb/>efforts to increase NERs makes a significant difference to the cost of achieving universal primary <lb/>enrolment with expenditure shortfall reduced by USD 1.9 billion in 2015. A wait-and-see attitude <lb/>is not advisable, however, because there is no guarantee that NERs will keep rising at the same <lb/>pace they have during the last decade without additional increases in educational investment. <lb/>The underlying challenge is that substantial heterogeneity exists among countries within <lb/>each region, so that regional averages do not portray well how much spending has to rise in <lb/>individual countries within a region. Universal primary education may be within reach at the <lb/>regional level even if it remains a distant prospect in individual countries. The required absolute <lb/>change and rate of increase in spending on education in some countries can be very high, and <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>35 <lb/>there is no reason to expect that countries from the region with higher budgets and/or closer to <lb/>achieving universal primary enrolment would subsidise countries with smaller budgets <lb/>11 <lb/>In addition, it is important to point out that these costs do not capture the economies of <lb/>scale implicit in achieving universal primary enrolment. These results are conditioned by the <lb/>assumption that the cost per student remains constant as NERs are raised towards 100%. <lb/>However, it is reasonable to assume that required expenditure per student rises the closer a <lb/>country gets to universal enrolment. Generally speaking, it should be more costly to raise the <lb/>share of enrolled students when enrolment is close to universal than when few students are <lb/>enrolled. For instance, providing schooling in remote areas is typically more challenging than it <lb/>is in major urban centres. Along the same lines, the absolute cost of achieving universal primary <lb/>education in Latin America and Caribbean is of the same order of magnitude as in sub-Saharan <lb/>Africa despite a much smaller population of school age. This is because while Latin America and <lb/>Caribbean is closer to achieving universal primary enrolment, the cost per student is much <lb/>higher in Latin America and Caribbean than in sub-Saharan Africa. <lb/>. <lb/>3. Expenditure Required to Achieve Health-related MDGs <lb/>The total spending required to meet health-related MDGs is calculated based on the <lb/>estimates from the World Health Organization (2010). According to these estimates, a little more <lb/>than USD 60 per capita will be required by 2015 to achieve health-related MDGs. The level of <lb/>expenditure per capita is assumed to rise linearly from its current level to USD 60 per capita by <lb/>2015. This figure is multiplied by the projected size of the population. <lb/>Table 6 below shows average total expenditure per capita by income group and by <lb/>region. While assuming a constant cost per capita to meet all three health MDGs is a convenient <lb/>and transparent simplifying assumption, a limitation of this section&apos;s calculations is that the cost <lb/>of meeting health-related goals is likely to be underestimated in some countries. For instance, of <lb/>all three goals, improvements in maternal health are those associated with the highest costs. <lb/>Further, achieving a goal such as reducing infant mortality is bound to get more expensive the <lb/>closer a country is to completing the goal. <lb/>11. Separate calculations show that, taken together, the countries with an education expenditure shortfall <lb/>would need to increase spending on education by 7.4% in 2015 compared to baseline expenditures. On <lb/>the face of it, such rate of increase sounds achievable. However, this kind of calculation implicitly <lb/>assumes that spending on education can be funded at the global level and allocated to countries where <lb/>it is needed to achieve universal primary enrolment. Indeed, at the regional level, the level of increase in <lb/>spending required looks more challenging: sub-Saharan Africa requires the largest proportional <lb/>increase, 22.3%, in the amount projected to be spent in 2015. The Middle East and North Africa comes <lb/>next, with 8.2%. <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>36 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>Table 6: Per Capita Health Expenditure by Region and by Income Group <lb/>(2009 USD) <lb/>Per Capita Expenditure on Health <lb/>Region <lb/>Market Exchange Rate <lb/>Purchasing Power Parity <lb/>Sub-Saharan Africa <lb/>182 <lb/>258 <lb/>Middle East &amp; North Africa <lb/>337 <lb/>641 <lb/>Europe &amp; Central Asia <lb/>388 <lb/>580 <lb/>East Asia &amp; Pacific <lb/>232 <lb/>430 <lb/>South Asia <lb/>84 <lb/>158 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean <lb/>108 <lb/>208 <lb/>Income group <lb/>Market Exchange Rate <lb/>Purchasing Power Parity <lb/>Low income <lb/>30 <lb/>65 <lb/>Lower-middle income <lb/>117 <lb/>204 <lb/>Upper-middle income <lb/>455 <lb/>753 <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>Table 7 shows that health-related MDG financing remains a matter of concern for a <lb/>number of countries, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Required additional <lb/>expenditures are roughly equally split between low-income countries and lower-middle-income <lb/>countries. Notably, lower-middle-income countries are where there have been significant <lb/>increases in expenditure in recent years; this calls into question whether these expenditure <lb/>increases can be sustained. This is all the more relevant as increased expenditures on health have <lb/>not consistently been accompanied by improvement in health outcomes, challenging the <lb/>relevance of the USD 60 per capita benchmark proposed by the WHO. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>37 <lb/>Table 7: Health-related Expenditure Needed by Region and by Income Group <lb/>(2009 USD billion) <lb/>Required additional health expenditure in 2015 <lb/>Region <lb/>Linear Expenditure Scenario <lb/>Constant Expenditure Scenario <lb/>Sub-Saharan Africa <lb/>16.4 <lb/>19.5 <lb/>Middle East &amp; North Africa <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>Europe &amp; Central Asia <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>East Asia &amp; Pacific <lb/>2.5 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>South Asia <lb/>12.8 <lb/>34.8 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>Total <lb/>31.8 <lb/>58.9 <lb/>Income group <lb/>Linear Expenditure Scenario <lb/>Constant Expenditure Scenario <lb/>Low income <lb/>25.3 <lb/>30.1 <lb/>Lower-middle income <lb/>6.5 <lb/>28.8 <lb/>Upper-middle income <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>Total <lb/>31.8 <lb/>58.9 <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>The constant expenditure scenario illustrated in Table 7 is this paper&apos;s upper-bound <lb/>estimate on the order of magnitude for financial resources necessary to reach the health-MDGs. It <lb/>is this upper-bound that is used for the total service delivery cost estimates, combined with the <lb/>corresponding upper-bound estimate for education, and the market exchange rate amount <lb/>needed for the poverty transfer. As explained above, these three costs can be added and <lb/>compared with the cost estimate derived from the &quot; financing gap &quot; calculations. <lb/>As explained in Section IV.1, there is a strong argument against using the &quot; financing gap &quot; <lb/>calculation for middle-income countries, given the high levels of inequality and high capital-<lb/>output ratios observed in the middle-income countries that are not on track to achieve the MDGs. <lb/>Development service delivery can be considered the more cost-effective way to achieve the goals <lb/>in these middle-income countries. The USD 28.8 billion in additional health expenditure, the <lb/>USD 7.7 billion in education expenditure and the USD 2.5 billion in income transfers can thus be <lb/>added to obtain a total service delivery cost in middle-income countries amounting to <lb/>USD 39 billion. A total of USD 59.1 billion is obtained in service delivery costs in low-and <lb/>middle-income countries if the USD 39 billion figure for middle-income countries is augmented <lb/>by the USD 20.1 billion needed in low-income countries that have no &quot; financing gap &quot; per se but <lb/>that are falling behind on the other MDGs, primarily health-related goals. This USD 59.1 billion <lb/>figure constitutes approximately half of the total cost, with the other half being the <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>38 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>USD 62.1 billion &quot; financing gap &quot; faced by low-income countries. Section IV.3 discusses how the <lb/>scope for increased mobilisation of domestic resources compares with these amounts, and then <lb/>Section IV.4 discusses in further detail the justification behind the particular choice of mixing <lb/>between the two types of cost estimates made in this paper. <lb/>IV.3.

Democratic Republic of the Congo could also raise a non-negligible <lb/>sum of money by improving tax collection. Nonetheless, improved tax collection is unfortunately <lb/>not a panacea for financing development. Indeed, many of the countries that have scope to <lb/>improve revenue collection are already well on their way to achieving the MDGs. <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>Central Afr.

Indeed, discussions among the <lb/>development partners at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea, <lb/>have highlighted the unique and growing importance of such South-South aid flows. <lb/>Importantly, while attempts can be made to compare these flows to ODA from traditional <lb/>partners, the discussions at Busan underscored the fact that the principles, commitments and <lb/>actions agreed among development partners with respect to traditional ODA are only a reference <lb/>for South-South partners on a voluntary basis. Therefore it is interesting to speculate the manner <lb/>with tax effort below 1 and compares the level <lb/>of domestic resources with ODA and FDI. Mexico is the country with the largest potential for an <lb/>increase in domestic resources through improved tax collection. It is interesting to note that <lb/>while Mexico still requires increases in educational spending to achieve the MDGs according to <lb/>the calculations in Section IV.2, the magnitude of the needed expenditures is only in the <lb/>hundreds of millions, while the potential tax resources that could be increased is on the order of <lb/>tens of billions. Notably, the other countries with the largest potential – Russia and Kazakhstan--<lb/>are not struggling to achieve the MDGs. This said, Colombia – which is struggling more than <lb/>Mexico – has the fourth largest potential to increase resources. In fact, the potential for increasing <lb/>tax resources in Colombia is large enough to cover the poverty gap and the increased educational <lb/>expenditures the country would require according to the calculations described in Section IV.2. <lb/>12.

			<body>Table 9 furthermore shows that the vast difference in the scale of potential additional tax <lb/>resources available between low-income and middle-income countries. While potential <lb/>additional tax resources as a share of GDP are similar across the groups, the absolute potential <lb/>amounts of additional tax resources differ greatly. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the scale <lb/>of additional tax resources available in middle income countries can cover the cost of MDG-<lb/>related service needs calculated in the previous sections. This is not true of the size of potential <lb/>additional tax resources in low-income countries, which in no case can cover the service related <lb/>MDG costs nor the financing gap cost. It therefore does not appear likely that domestic resource <lb/>mobilisation can make a significant contribution to filling the resource gap in the low-income <lb/>countries with the largest relative needs. <lb/>Table 9: Potential Tax Increases by Income Group <lb/>Income Group <lb/>Average Potential Tax Increase as a Share of GDP <lb/>Total Potential Tax Increase <lb/>Low-income <lb/>2.5% <lb/>USD 3 billion <lb/>Lower middle-income <lb/>4.7% <lb/>USD 1 billion <lb/>Upper middle-income <lb/>3.1% <lb/>USD 60 billion <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>Despite the grim picture depicted above with respect to the scope for increased domestic <lb/>resources in low-income countries that have an MDG resource need, it must be noted that <lb/>conclusions drawn above owe a lot to the simplified nature of the calculations in question. These <lb/>results should only be interpreted as providing a first-cut of such calculations rather than the <lb/>ultimate answer, particularly on a country-by-country basis. There may be additional scope for <lb/>raising revenue in some countries, if the analysis was instead performed with detailed country-<lb/>level data. <lb/>Finally, given that the MDGs have 2015 as their deadline, it is also important to note that <lb/>raising additional revenue is a time-consuming task and can pose particular challenges to low-<lb/>income countries with limited administrative capacity. Determined efforts would need to be <lb/>made to overcome the inherent difficulty of raising additional revenue in such a short time <lb/>period, and given capacity constraints as well as governance issues. For example, if <lb/>improvements in tax collection focus too much on natural resource rents, there is a risk that <lb/>reversals in commodity prices might adversely affect revenue mobilisation and endanger <lb/>progress on the MDGs. <lb/>IV.4. Mixing cost estimates without double-counting <lb/>Throughout this paper, two separate sets of MDG cost estimates have been entertained. <lb/>The results presented in Section IV.1 are based on the premise that &quot; a rising tide lifts all boats &quot; <lb/>and that economic growth at a sufficiently high rate can spur development success, particularly <lb/>in other human development outcomes captured by the MDGs. In contrast, the results presented <lb/>Section IV.2 are founded on the simple argument that improving public expenditures on service <lb/>delivery can lead to MDG achievement. In both cases, the link implicitly assumed between <lb/>public expenditure and social outcomes is admittedly naïve and, thus the connection made <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>42 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>between the cost estimated and the progress expected is tenuous at best. Nevertheless, this <lb/>paper&apos;s estimates serve their limited purpose quite well: at a global level these calculations help <lb/>to provide a useful starting point for understanding the level of resources needed from both <lb/>domestic and external sources together to achieve the MDGs. <lb/>The cost estimates for achieving the MDGs through development service delivery appear <lb/>to be approximately on order of magnitude smaller than the estimates of the capital requirement <lb/>to achieve the growth needed to meet the MDGs. The service delivery calculations in section IV.2 <lb/>lead to a global figure in the tens of USD billions, while the financing gap in Section IV.1 is <lb/>calculated to be on the order of hundreds of USD billions. Yet, this apparent difference in annual <lb/>amounts ignores the nature of the expenditures implied by the separate theoretical frameworks <lb/>underlying the two different sets of cost estimates; this is why this paper opts to utilise the <lb/>financing gap calculations for the low-income countries and to focus on the service delivery costs <lb/>for middle-income countries. <lb/>Indeed, the financing gap approach owes its intellectual heritage to the Harrod-Domar <lb/>growth models underpinning the &quot; take-off &quot; and &quot; big push &quot; literature of the 1950s and 1960s. The <lb/>stated aim of filling the gap in these models is to propel economies into a pattern of self-<lb/>sustaining growth in order to escape a poverty trap. As discussed in Sections II and III, aid may <lb/>not be the ideal means by which this gap is filled. However, beyond thinking about development <lb/>resources in terms of aid, these Harrod-Domar models – albeit simple – can be used to estimate <lb/>the rough size of the temporary capital requirement needed to increase growth and achieve <lb/>sufficiently high growth rates to help transform the structure of the economy into a self-<lb/>sustaining growth path. <lb/>In contrast, the development service approach is premised on the notion that public <lb/>expenditure is not vigorous enough to ensure that the poor stay out of poverty, that children are <lb/>enrolled in primary schools, and that child mortality, maternal mortality and pandemic diseases <lb/>are sufficiently kept in check. Taken at face value, this implies that the financing gap is <lb/>constructed as a time-bound target meant to raise domestic income high enough to ensure self-<lb/>sustaining MDG achievement, while the service delivery costs are conceived in a way that <lb/>requires the corresponding transfers to be maintained beyond the 2015 deadline to secure MDG <lb/>achievement. In other words, a drop in development service expenditure is expected to be <lb/>accompanied by a recurrence of poverty, declines in child enrolment, and resurgence of child <lb/>mortality, maternal mortality and deadly disease that compromise progress made on the MDGs. <lb/>The annual service delivery costs are naturally smaller than the annual financing gap in <lb/>both low-income and middle-income countries. However, it is important to compare the total <lb/>capital layout implied by the different theoretical frameworks that govern the separate cost <lb/>estimates. Table 10 compares the total capital cost of filling the financing gap in the lead up to <lb/>2015 with the total capital cost of increasing service delivery expenditures into perpetuity. The <lb/>former is accomplished by simply summing the financing gap amounts over the six years <lb/>between 2009 – the base year used for the calculations – and 2015. The latter requires discounting <lb/>into perpetuity the recurring annual service delivery expenditure needed to achieve the MDGs <lb/>given the theoretical framework adopted for these calculations. As shown in Table 10, the total <lb/>capital layout needed to fill the financing gap in low-income countries, USD 372 billion, is a bit <lb/>more than half the net present value of recurring development service expenditure in these <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>43 <lb/>countries, USD 625 billion. In contrast, the discounted value of the recurring cash flows required <lb/>to achieve the MDGs through development service delivery in the middle-income countries, <lb/>USD 677 billion, is roughly half the financing gap in these countries, USD 1 308 billion. From this <lb/>point of view, filling the financing gap is actually less costly in low-income countries, while <lb/>achieving the MDGs through service delivery is less costly in middle-income countries. <lb/>Table 10: Total Capital Layout Required (2009 USD billion) <lb/>Total Capital Layout <lb/>Low income <lb/>Middle income <lb/>Total <lb/>Filling the &quot; financing gap &quot; , 2009-15* <lb/>372 <lb/>1 308 <lb/>1 680 <lb/>Providing services into perpetuity <lb/>625 <lb/>677 <lb/>1 302 <lb/>Notes: *assumes filling the financing gap over the 6 years until 2015 with the additional <lb/>assumption that the increased growth rate becomes sustainable beyond that date. <lb/>**the total expenditures needed for services here are discounted by a factor of 5.9% (the <lb/>average of 6-month LIBOR in the US, 1980-2012 as documented in IMF (2011)), thus <lb/>assuming that expenditure on development services continue beyond 2015. <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations. <lb/>The above results are also clearly linked to the discussion in Section IV.1: High <lb/>incremental capital-output ratios and high levels of inequality make poverty reduction through <lb/>investing in growth in most middle-income countries extremely costly, particularly in <lb/>comparison with the annual expenditures required to deliver MDG achievement through service <lb/>delivery. Moreover, as shown in Section IV.3, the scope for increasing domestic resource <lb/>mobilisation is also much higher, although perhaps not sufficiently enough, in middle-income <lb/>countries. Yet, if improved service delivery through increased resource mobilisation is the key to <lb/>MDG achievement in the middle-income countries, the question remains as to where should the <lb/>resources come from to fill the financing gap in low-income countries. <lb/>IV.5. Filling the &quot; financing gap &quot; in low-income countries without relying solely on <lb/>ODA <lb/>The question of how to fill the financing gap in low-income countries is linked to the <lb/>reason why previous MDG cost estimates have focused on the argument to scale-up aid flows <lb/>over the past decade. In nominal dollar terms, the scaling-up of aid flows has been observed over <lb/>the last decade, with aid flows essentially doubling between the early 2000s and the end of the <lb/>decade. However, in real dollar terms and even more so as a share of Development Assistance <lb/>Committee (DAC) member country GDP, this scaling-up has been less sizeable. There is thus a <lb/>need to evaluate the implication that there should be a renewed focus on holding DAC member <lb/>governments to deliver on the commitments made in Monterrey, at Gleneagles and in Accra, and <lb/>most recently at Busan. <lb/>That DAC member governments make good on the substantial commitments that they <lb/>have made since the inception of the MDG framework is in fact a key criterion for reaching <lb/>MDG 8, the goal of building a global partnership of development. However, the budget <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>44 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>pressures on many DAC member governments are such that expecting ODA to remain constant <lb/>in nominal terms is probably already an optimistic scenario. Further, in the spirit of the Accra <lb/>Agenda for Action (2008) and its emphasis on ownership of development policies and on the <lb/>importance of domestic resource mobilisation, this paper&apos;s stated aim is to look beyond scaled-<lb/>up ODA as a prerequisite for MDG achievement. There is therefore a need to assess potential <lb/>sources of alternative development finance that can increase development investment in low-<lb/>income countries to the level of the financing gaps that characterise them. <lb/>There is also a need to re-examine the rationale behind the often cited goal of increasing <lb/>ODA flows to 0.7% of DAC member GDP. This target is often used as a measure of progress on <lb/>MDG 8. However, the call to scale-up aid flows to this 0.7% level predates the MDG framework. <lb/>Like the financing gap itself, this call has its origins in the simple Harrod-Domar model <lb/>employed by development economists in the 1960s. This 0.7% target actually stems from back-of-<lb/>the-envelope calculations performed by Jan Tinbergen and Hollis Chenery in the context of the <lb/>first &quot; development decade &quot; in the 1960s. Using a simple Harrod-Domar model, these economists <lb/>asserted that total capital flows to the developing world ought to be around 1% of the developed <lb/>world&apos;s GNI (Clemens and Moss, 2005; Vandemoortele, 2011). At the time of their calculations, <lb/>private capital flows to developing countries constituted approximately 0.3% of the developed <lb/>countries&apos; GNI; therefore, they considered that the remaining 0.7% could be filled by public <lb/>flows. Figure 6 shows that during the 1970s, again during the late 1990s, and again during the <lb/>mid-2000s, private capital flows from DAC members to partners were substantially higher than <lb/>this 0.3% and in fact exceeded the share of DAC member output that was transferred to <lb/>development partners through concessionary flows. <lb/>Figure 6: Concessionary and private capital flows from DAC member countries to <lb/>development partners, 1970-2010 (% of DAC member current GDP) <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations based on OECD-DAC. <lb/>Figure 7 plots concessionary and private capital flows in real terms; it shows a clear rising <lb/>in the magnitude of private capital flows to development partners over the last forty years. What <lb/>Figures 6 and 7 also show, however, is the extreme volatility of these private capital flows to <lb/>0.0% <lb/>0.1% <lb/>0.2% <lb/>0.3% <lb/>0.4% <lb/>0.5% <lb/>0.6% <lb/>0.7% <lb/>0.8% <lb/>0.9% <lb/>ODA, other official flows and net grants by private voluntary organisations <lb/>Private capital flows <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>developing countries, particularly when compared to concessionary flows. Nonetheless, the <lb/>order of magnitude and the trend of these private capital flows is such that the prospect of filling <lb/>the financing gap in low-income countries at least partly through increased private capital flows <lb/>is a real option. The high volatility of these flows needs to be addressed, however. If these <lb/>private capital flows were to constitute a large share of development finance, their volatility <lb/>would have to be properly managed so that it does not exacerbate macroeconomic instability in <lb/>developing countries. <lb/>Figure 7: Concessionary and Private Capital Flows <lb/>from DAC Member Countries To Developing Countries, 1970-2010 (2008 USD billion) <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; calculations based on OECD-DAC. <lb/>If private capital flows are to play a larger role in financing human development <lb/>outcomes, governments must do more to encourage such flows and manage their volatility. <lb/>Private flows are attracted by economic returns and are therefore sensitive to economic policies <lb/>in the recipient countries as well as external conditions, such as commodity prices. These factors <lb/>are not all within the control of the recipient countries. Given a shift in the composition of capital <lb/>flows towards emerging partners, there is also a shift in the kinds of projects being financed. For <lb/>instance, traditional donors tend to fund social infrastructure projects such as water and roads, <lb/>which are of particular relevance for MDGs. In contrast, the 2011 edition of the African Economic <lb/>Outlook has documented that emerging partners tend to focus on production oriented <lb/>infrastructure such as power generation and railways. While FDI is likely to contribute to <lb/>growth, it might not be directly linked to the attainment of the MDGs. Therefore countries <lb/>interacting with emerging partners need to do their best to keep their development strategy <lb/>focused on how FDI can best help finance human development outcomes. <lb/>If private capital is a largely untapped source of MDG financing, should governments <lb/>engage in borrowing on non-concessional terms to achieve the MDGs? While this may be <lb/>acceptable in some situations, debt issues remain a potential area of concern. Concerns about <lb/>institutional quality and absorptive capacity may also be equally valid for other ways of <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>350 <lb/>400 <lb/>450 <lb/>500 <lb/>Constant 2008 USD billion <lb/>ODA <lb/>Other official flows <lb/>Net grants by private voluntary organisations <lb/>Private capital flows <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>46 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>financing the MDG cost such as private flows. Unfortunately, for many low-income countries, <lb/>private capital may be no realistic substitute for official financing. Given the pressure on ODA <lb/>budgets however, the shift in focus of financing of the MDGs towards domestic and private <lb/>sources may be more demanding on the countries seeking to attain the MDGs. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>47 <lb/>V. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>The scale of financing needed to achieve the MDGs is affordable at the global level, <lb/>particularly if countries adopt a broad view of the types of resources that can help improve <lb/>human development outcomes in countries that are falling behind on MDG progress. Official <lb/>Development Assistance remains an important source for financing MDG achievement, <lb/>particularly in low-income countries. DAC member countries therefore need to deliver on their <lb/>outstanding commitments, particularly with respect to making aid more effective, so that it can <lb/>help catalyse development success. Domestic resource mobilisation via increased tax revenues is <lb/>the most sustainable and dependable source of funding towards MDG achievement, particularly <lb/>in middle-income countries. Developing countries are making notable efforts to improve tax <lb/>collection. They can achieve further progress in broadening their tax base, particularly in the <lb/>taxation of resource rents, which have grown dramatically over the last decade. Private capital <lb/>flows also represent a sizeable, and largely untapped, resource for MDG financing. More can be <lb/>done to ensure that these flows are fully exploited to promoted MDG achievement, whether they <lb/>come from traditional DAC members or from emerging partner countries. <lb/>The purpose of this paper is to revisit the costing estimates that have shaped much of the <lb/>discourse on the MDGs over the past decade. A fresh perspective on countries&apos; capacity to raise <lb/>additional development investment on their own is needed. The orders of magnitude of <lb/>resources needed to achieve the MDGs in the developing world as a whole are compatible with <lb/>the degree of financial resources available, both domestic and external. While this paper offers a <lb/>specific figure for how much achieving the MDGs could cost, the aim is not to propose that <lb/>development partners necessarily scramble to raise the corresponding amount of ODA. Rather, <lb/>these estimates should be used for understanding the size of the problem that continues to face <lb/>many countries, and indeed the world. Although it is not an insurmountably high amount, it is <lb/>of an order of magnitude larger than the size of resources that can be raised from development <lb/>co-operation alone, especially in current circumstances. <lb/>The USD 120 billion of additional annual resources estimated to be needed to achieve the <lb/>MDGs is divided between a USD 62.1 billion &quot; financing gap &quot; in 20 low-income countries and <lb/>USD 59.2 billion of expenditure on the provision of development services in 79 other low-and <lb/>middle-income countries. Some USD 64 billion in additional tax revenues could be raised <lb/>through tax collection, primarily in middle-income countries. Unfortunately, however, the bulk <lb/>of these additional resources would be raised in countries that are already on track for achieving <lb/>the MDGs. Therefore, additional external resources are needed in a number of countries, <lb/>particularly in the low-income category. While re-allocation of ODA towards these countries and <lb/>making good on aid commitments can contribute to meeting these needs, the bulk of additional <lb/>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>48 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>resources probably needs to come from elsewhere. Complementary sources of funding include <lb/>emerging countries that have experienced success in scaling-up their own resources. A renewed <lb/>and more systematic attempt to put private capital flows to work in the service of development <lb/>in low-income countries is another complementary option. <lb/>However, even with full financing of all the MDG cost, the MDGs will not necessarily be <lb/>achieved. As pointed out in this paper, financing health and education expenditures is not <lb/>identical to ensuring health and education outcomes. They require good policies in the form of <lb/>strong public expenditure management at all levels of government, good implementation <lb/>capacity, and a medium-term fiscal policy that would ensure the sustainability of the MDGs. <lb/>While the availability of financing is clearly important, it is no panacea for realising the MDGs. <lb/>This paper aims to appraise the limits to the costing frameworks that the development <lb/>community can employ to gauge the scale of resources needed globally to achieve development <lb/>goals. Like the wise men in the ancient parable, development economists who construct and use <lb/>these global costing estimates must be cautious not to focus too much attention on what the <lb/>individual estimates might imply for policy, but rather how the size of the estimates as a whole <lb/>compares to the size of other resources available, beyond Official Development Assistance. MDG <lb/>achievement corresponds to a large, but manageable cost for the world as a whole. However, <lb/>expecting that this cost should be provided by official development assistance alone is akin to <lb/>assuming that the elephant has a snake for its nose, rather than a trunk. <lb/>As we approach the 2015 deadline of the MDGs, it is important to reflect that the time-<lb/>bound nature of the goals has helped galvanize global dialogue and action about development <lb/>challenges. At the end of the day, however, concrete progress can only take the form of <lb/>individual country-specific interventions. These interventions are something to which all global <lb/>citizens, not just development agencies and concessional lenders, can contribute. Looking <lb/>beyond 2015, it is important that this broader vision of development co-operation be maintained <lb/>and to inform how the process of global target setting is undertaken and how the corresponding <lb/>achievement is attained. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>49 <lb/></body>

			<body>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/>52 <lb/>© OECD 2011 <lb/>ANNEX 1: CALCULATING THE FINANCING GAP <lb/>The methods used by Devarajan et al. (2002) are adapted to calculate the financing gap, <lb/>i.e. to estimate the additional resources needed to increase growth and thereby reduce income or <lb/>consumption poverty headcount ratios by one-half of their 1990 levels in each country. <lb/>A simple Harrod-Domar model defines the per capita growth rate, y, as a function of the <lb/>savings rate, s, the incremental capital-output ratio, θ, and the population growth rate, p: <lb/>í µí±¦ = <lb/>í µí± <lb/>í µí¼ <lb/>− í µí± <lb/>Saving (as a share of total output Y) is assumed to be entirely invested domestically and is <lb/>augmented with foreign investment inflows, FDI, and aid inflows, ODA, plus any other <lb/>additional resources (either external or domestic in origin). Thus, the above equation becomes: <lb/>í µí±¦ = <lb/>(í µí± í µí± + í µí±í µí°·í µí°´+µí°´+ í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼ + í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± ) <lb/>í µí± <lb/> * <lb/>1 <lb/>í µí¼ <lb/>− í µí± <lb/>Next, the savings rate, output, foreign investment inflows, aid, population growth and <lb/>the incremental capital output ratio are taken as given. Thus, it is possible to calculate as a <lb/>function of these variables the amount of additional resources and the incremental capital-output <lb/>ratio--estimates for each country over a long period, as described below--needed to achieve a <lb/>target growth rate: <lb/>í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± = (í µí±¦ + í µí±) * í µí± * í µí¼ − í µí± í µí± + í µí±í µí°·í µí°´+µí°´+ í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼ <lb/>The target growth rate is determined by the growth in consumption or income needed to <lb/>achieve the mean consumption or income that gives a poverty headcount half of 1990 levels <lb/>given the most recent Lorenz curve parameters, as spelled out in Section III: <lb/>y = (μ 2015target /μ 2009 ) ( 1 <lb/>6 <lb/>) <lb/>The values for í µí¼ 2009 are extrapolated by adjusting the most recently available household <lb/>survey data available in the PovcalNet database with the respective country&apos;s real GDP per <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2011)14 <lb/></body>

As shown by Datt (1998), any <lb/>level of consumption or income per capita can be shown to be associated with a given poverty <lb/>headcount, H, Lorenz curve parameters, π, and a poverty line, z. The parameters of the Lorenz <lb/>curve are estimated for each country using PovcalNet&apos;s data on each decile&apos;s share of income or <lb/>consumption available for 117 countries from the PovcalNet online database. For most countries, <lb/>this database uses distributional data from surveys conducted during the mid to late 2000s. Two <lb/>parameterisations of the Lorenz curve are tried, and the valid curve with the best fit is used. <lb/>Then, the target mean consumption or income level, μ2015 target, is derived as a function of the <lb/>estimated Lorenz curve parameters, πlatest, the headcount ratio and the poverty line, zUSD 1.25 / day <lb/>(that is, USD 38 PPP per month), following Datt (1998): <lb/>í µí¼ 2015 í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±(í µí°» 2015 , í µí¼ í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí± í µí±¡ , í µí± § USD1.25 <lb/>í µí±í µí±í µí±¦ <lb/>) <lb/>The incremental capital output ratio, í µí¼, is then calculated.
