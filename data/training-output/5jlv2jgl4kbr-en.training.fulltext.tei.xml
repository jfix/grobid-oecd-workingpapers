			<p>Dans la zone euro, la capacité des finances publiques à soutenir la croissance équitable s&apos;est globalement détériorée.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Face aux inquiétudes suscitées par le niveau élevé et croissant de l&apos;endettement public, et parfois sous la pression<lb/> exercée par les marchés, les autorités des pays ont procédé à un effort d&apos;assainissement budgétaire massif en 2011-13<lb/> dans un contexte de conjoncture économique défavorable, ce qui est généralement considéré comme ayant contribué à<lb/> intensifier et à prolonger la récession. Le processus d&apos;assainissement s&apos;est ensuite ralenti, mais les pays disposant<lb/> d&apos;une marge de manoeuvre budgétaire ont peu utilisé la souplesse autorisée par les règles budgétaires de l&apos;UE pour<lb/> stimuler la demande globale dans la zone euro. De manière générale, la composition des dépenses est devenue moins<lb/> favorable à la croissance du fait de coupes drastiques dans les investissements publics. Sur le plan des recettes, la<lb/> fiscalité du travail, déjà élevée, s&apos;est encore alourdie. Les réformes structurelles qui peuvent avoir des retombées<lb/> positives directes sur la composition ou l&apos;efficience des finances publiques ont marqué le pas.<lb/> Si la plupart des leviers d&apos;action permettant d&apos;améliorer les finances publiques restent situés au niveau des pays, les<lb/> politiques européennes et nationales peuvent se renforcer mutuellement dans les domaines de la gouvernance<lb/> budgétaire et de l&apos;investissement public. Pour faire en sorte que l&apos;orientation budgétaire de l&apos;ensemble de la zone euro<lb/> contribue à alimenter la reprise, les pays qui disposent d&apos;une marge de manoeuvre budgétaire au sens des règles du<lb/> Pacte de stabilité et de croissance devraient recourir à l&apos;appui budgétaire pour stimuler la croissance, et il faudra<lb/> mettre à profit les dispositifs d&apos;incitation existants et la souplesse prévue par les règles en vigueur pour poursuivre la<lb/> réforme des politiques fiscales et de dépenses. Au niveau national, il est essentiel de poursuivre l&apos;amélioration des<lb/> cadres budgétaires, y compris en adoptant des règles de dépenses et en procédant à des examens réguliers des<lb/> dépenses. Pour promouvoir la formation de capital et rendre celui-ci plus efficace, les ressources budgétaires de l&apos;UE<lb/> disponibles pour l&apos;investissement devraient être déployées de façon à créer un effet d&apos;attraction sur les fonds publics<lb/> et les financements privés nationaux et à rendre l&apos;investissement plus productif. À l&apos;échelon national, des<lb/> investissements mieux coordonnés entre les différents niveaux d&apos;administration et des capacités administratives<lb/> renforcées conféreraient aux investissements une efficience accrue.<lb/> Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de la Zone euro 2016<lb/> (http://www.oecd.org/fr/economie/etude-economique-union-europeenne-et-zone-euro.htm)<lb/> Classification JEL: E62, F45, H20, H50, H54, H61<lb/> Mots clef: Zone euro, assainissement budgétaire, composition des finances publiques, Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance, règles<lb/> budgétaires, organismes budgétaires indépendants, politique régionale européenne, Plan d&apos;investissement pour l&apos;Europe,<lb/> investissement public<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)40<lb/></figure>

			<table>/WKP(2016)40<lb/> MAKING PUBLIC FINANCES MORE GROWTH AND EQUITY-FRIENDLY IN THE EURO<lb/> AREA<lb/> By Álvaro Pina 1<lb/> There is strong potential to improve growth and equity through better public finances<lb/></table>

			<head>Public finances matter for growth and equity through multiple channels<lb/></head>

			<p>Fiscal policies and instruments can help to achieve major socio-economic goals, such as providing<lb/> cyclical stabilisation, promoting long-term economic growth and addressing redistributive objectives.<lb/> Sustainability, cyclicality, and composition and efficiency of taxation and spending are crucial,<lb/> interconnected dimensions of public finances and affect growth and equity through a variety of channels.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ensuring debt sustainability and smoothing cyclical fluctuations tend to be mutually reinforcing. High<lb/> levels of debt can hamper the ability to stabilise the economy (<ref type="biblio">Fall and Fournier, 2015</ref>). In turn, deep<lb/> recessions can harm long-term growth and thus compound sustainability challenges through hysteresis<lb/> effects. Certain changes in the composition of expenditure, such as greater prioritisation of public<lb/> investment or education, or of revenue, such as shifting taxation from labour to consumption and property,<lb/> can also support growth (<ref type="biblio">Johansson et al., 2008; Cournède et al., 2013</ref>). The same holds for reforms of a<lb/> more qualitative nature, such as broadening tax bases or greater efficiency in spending.<lb/></p>

			<p>In advanced economies, reforms of the composition of public finances can lift gross domestic product<lb/> (GDP) per capita growth by close to 1 percentage point over 5 to 10 years (IMF, 2015a). Among OECD<lb/> countries, making the composition of expenditure converge to that of the best performers (for instance, by<lb/> increasing the share of public investment) could yield even larger growth payoffs (<ref type="biblio">Fournier and Johansson,<lb/> 2016</ref>).<lb/> Fiscal policy also affects income distribution. Effective cyclical stabilisation tends to decrease<lb/> inequality by reducing the risk of long-term unemployment. The tax-spending mix of consolidation<lb/> episodes also matters for inequality, with spending-based episodes generally more harmful than revenue-<lb/>based ones (<ref type="biblio">Woo et al., 2013</ref>). This creates potential trade-offs between equity and other objectives, since<lb/> spending-based consolidations are often regarded as more favourable to long-term growth and more likely<lb/> to stabilise debt (<ref type="biblio">Molnar, 2012</ref>). At a more disaggregated level, some changes in budget composition may<lb/> also pose growth-equity trade-offs, such as when shifting taxation from direct to indirect taxes, but others<lb/> are beneficial on both counts, such as when increasing the share of education in public spending (<ref type="biblio">Fournier<lb/> and Johansson, 2016</ref>). Greater prioritisation of spending on health, childcare and active labour market<lb/> policies, accompanied by steps to preserve or enhance efficiency levels in those areas, is also likely to<lb/> benefit both growth and equity (<ref type="biblio">Cournède et al., 2013; OECD, 2015a</ref>).<lb/> Coordinated action by euro area countries, harnessing national and common institutions and policies,<lb/> is needed to make fiscal policy more supportive of inclusive growth. Countries with fiscal space within the<lb/> boundaries of the Stability and Growth Pact should take account of the positive spillover effects of<lb/> domestic fiscal expansion onto other Member States and contribute to aggregate demand in the euro area.<lb/> Member states should also further improve their budgetary frameworks, including by adopting expenditure<lb/> rules, conducting spending reviews and implementing the ensuing recommendations, and exploring the full<lb/> potential of independent fiscal institutions. This would support debt sustainability and cyclical stabilisation<lb/> objectives, and would also help the implementation of reforms in the composition and efficiency of<lb/> taxation and public spending. To tackle persistent investment weakness in Europe, these reforms should<lb/> include coordinated efforts to increase public investment and make it more efficient, and to create better<lb/> financial and regulatory conditions for private investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>The crisis has taken a heavy toll on public finances<lb/></head>

			<p>On several counts, euro area public finances worsened as a consequence of the global financial crisis.<lb/> The increase in public debt was substantial and broadly comparable to that in the United States (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>),<lb/> largely due to the recession and to specific events, such as banking sector rescues (<ref type="biblio">Eyraud and Wu, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Support to the financial sector has also implied sizeable levels of contingent liabilities. High actual and<lb/> contingent debt can weaken fiscal sustainability: it can notably trigger shifts in market sentiment, which<lb/> could make debt financing more difficult. High debt levels also tend to be associated with lower growth,<lb/> though no firm conclusions have been reached on the direction of causality in the empirical literature (e.g.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Panizza and Presbitero, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Concerns about high and rising debt, together with market pressure in some instances, led to sharp<lb/> fiscal consolidation, especially in 2011 and 2012, and to a lesser extent 2013 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). All euro area<lb/> countries, including those which are usually considered to have a solid fiscal position, have undertaken<lb/> consolidation efforts, which in several cases were well above 1 percentage point of GDP per year<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).</p>

			<p>1.<lb/> A fiscal consolidation episode is a period of consecutive years where the underlying primary balance is improving.<lb/> A deterioration of this balance in an intermediate year is admissible, provided the balance improves in the sum of any two<lb/> adjacent years. Episodes considered in the chart are those starting in 2009 or later. Due to data limitations on the composition<lb/> of consolidation, the final year considered is 2013, though for some countries consolidation efforts have continued afterwards.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even though delivered on a scale broadly comparable to plans, fiscal consolidation had a smaller-<lb/>than-expected payoff in terms of halting the debt build-up (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>), largely because of weak growth.<lb/> Although estimates of the magnitude of spillovers vary across studies, fiscal consolidation in one country<lb/> can have a sizeable negative growth impact on others, especially in bad times (<ref type="biblio">Goujard, 2013; Carnot and<lb/> Castro, 2015</ref>). As a result, the simultaneous fiscal adjustment across the euro area, including in core<lb/> countries, is considered to have made the recession deeper and longer (<ref type="biblio">Baldwin et al., 2015</ref>). Within<lb/> individual countries, the impact of consolidation on output, which tends to be larger in downturns and for<lb/> spending cuts, may also have been underestimated, though the evidence is not fully conclusive (<ref type="biblio">Blanchard<lb/> and Leigh, 2013; Pain et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, shifts in expenditure composition have generally been detrimental to equity and longer-<lb/>term growth, especially in the countries carrying out the largest fiscal adjustments. Spending restraint has<lb/> fallen heavily on public investment (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), which in the countries hit hardest by the crisis was often<lb/> more than halved in nominal terms (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), falling as a share of GDP to values below the euro area<lb/> average. In those countries, public consumption, including for education and health care purposes<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), was also substantially curbed. In contrast, pensions have tended to be spared. Though making<lb/> modest contributions to overall consolidation, social protection spending on family and children<lb/> (comprising cash transfers and in-kind services and benefits) has often taken deep cuts (again, mostly in<lb/> countries making the largest consolidation efforts).<lb/> Developments in revenue composition have been less harmful, but still a matter of concern. Often the<lb/> largest stream of revenue, social contributions have tended to account for a modest share of the adjustment,<lb/> especially in the countries worst hit by the crisis. This is welcome, given the potential negative impacts of<lb/> social contributions hikes on both growth and equity (<ref type="biblio">Cournède et al., 2013</ref>). The brunt of revenue<lb/> increases has come from the two other largest items, consumption taxes (other than environmental ones)<lb/> and especially personal income taxes (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Hikes in the latter can make income distribution less<lb/> unequal but tend to penalise employment and growth, especially when implemented through rate increases.<lb/></p>

			<p>Labour tax wedges in euro area countries, already high in international comparison, have tended to rise<lb/> further (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). More recently, many euro area countries are planning or implementing labour tax<lb/> reductions, though measures could be more ambitious (European Commission, 2015a). Unlike on the<lb/> spending side, some positive developments have taken place as regards smaller revenue items, such as<lb/> property or green taxes (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Recurrent taxes on immovable property, which tend to be among the<lb/> least distortive forms of taxation, have often been substantially increased. In some countries, revenue from<lb/> environmental taxes has also outpaced total primary revenue.<lb/></p>

			<p>1.<lb/> Fiscal consolidation episodes are the same as those in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. On both revenue and expenditure sides, increases or<lb/> decreases in cyclically-adjusted budget items do not always relate to discretionary policy measures. For instance, tax elasticities<lb/> can fluctuate for reasons not captured by the corrections performed for the economic cycle and for one-offs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tax and benefit systems have generally mitigated the impact of rising inequality in market income<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2015b</ref>), but available data suggests that this was mainly due to social transfers. In<lb/> contrast, the redistributive role played by taxes somewhat decreased in several countries in recent<lb/> consolidation episodes (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). Further, low incomes have sometimes recorded the highest increases in<lb/> labour tax wedges (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>These developments in the composition of government revenue and spending have gone hand in hand<lb/> with a modest degree of implementation of structural reforms with direct positive implications for the<lb/> composition or efficiency of public finances. Action in response to country-specific recommendations,<lb/> addressed to countries in the context of the European Semester, has on average been relatively low, and<lb/> below-average in fiscal-structural policy areas (<ref type="biblio">Deroose and Griesse, 2014</ref>). For instance, there has been<lb/> relatively limited progress in reducing taxes on labour and broadening tax bases. On the spending side,<lb/> reforms to strengthen public administration governance and to improve cost-effectiveness and performance<lb/> in key domains, such as education and health, have also tended to display below-average implementation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reforms at both European and national levels are needed<lb/></head>

			<p>Most policy levers to make public finances more growth and equity-friendly remain essentially at the<lb/> country level, despite an important role for European policies in addressing cross-country implications. On<lb/> the spending side, examples include the organisation of education and healthcare, and the design of social<lb/> protection systems. On the revenue side, the prime national policy lever is the structure of taxation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In other domains, European policies exert major impacts on public finances. National budgets, though<lb/> remaining in the remit of national governments and parliaments, need to comply with the requirements of<lb/> the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Likewise, national public investment strategies are subject to<lb/> European rules (e.g. those of European regional policy) and have the potential for synergies with policies<lb/> at the European Union (EU) level, such as the Investment Plan for Europe. This paper focusses on two<lb/> prime areas where European and national spheres interact and can be mutually-reinforcing: fiscal<lb/> governance and public investment policies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fiscal governance matters for multiple dimensions of public finance overall performance. Especially<lb/> since the crisis, numerical fiscal rules have often been specified in a way to reconcile sustainability and<lb/> stabilisation (<ref type="biblio">Schaechter et al., 2012</ref>). Other desirable features of fiscal governance, such as a multi-year<lb/> budget horizon and independent fiscal institutions, can enhance the effectiveness of numerical rules and<lb/> yield benefits for the composition and efficiency of public finances. For instance, better budget institutions<lb/> tend to lead to more growth-friendly fiscal consolidation (IMF, 2014a; <ref type="biblio">Gonçalves and Pina, 2016</ref>), and<lb/> multi-year budget frameworks help optimise public procurement and, in particular, public investment<lb/> (OECD, 2015b; IMF, 2015b).<lb/> Public investment is one of the fiscal tools with the strongest impacts on growth, both in the short and<lb/> the long run, and impacts tend to increase with investment efficiency, in turn underpinned by good<lb/> governance (IMF, 2015b). Short-run multipliers often exceed unity, especially if an expansion in public<lb/> investment is coordinated across countries (OECD, 2015c). Due to increases in productive capacity, long-<lb/>run output gains tend to be even higher (<ref type="biblio">Bom and Ligthart, 2014</ref>). A key feature behind them is the ability<lb/> of sound public investment projects to make the private sector more productive, and hence crowd-in<lb/> private investment. Increasing investment, both public and private, has particular urgency in Europe, where<lb/> capital formation is still well below pre-crisis levels.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving fiscal governance to promote inclusive growth<lb/> Reforming European fiscal rules<lb/></head>

			<p>The SGP has since its inception a dual structure, with a corrective arm and a preventive arm. The first,<lb/> also called the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), is based on ceilings for the nominal deficit and debt as<lb/> a ratio to GDP (3% and 60%, respectively). It has a stronger legal basis, since it is enshrined in the Treaty.<lb/> The preventive arm is based on the so-called Medium-Term Objective (MTO), which provides a medium-<lb/>term target for the structural budget balance of each country (i.e. the nominal balance netting out the<lb/> cyclical component and one-off and other temporary measures).<lb/> Some 2011-13 reforms make better allowance for the fiscal and economic situation of countries (e.g.<lb/> by further modulating the pace of fiscal adjustment as a function of economic conditions). At the same<lb/> time, SGP rules have become complex due to the proliferation of different numerical targets, procedures,<lb/> contingency provisions and compliance indicators across the two arms (OECD, 2014a; <ref type="biblio">Eyraud and Wu,<lb/> 2015</ref>). The SGP has nonetheless remained primarily focussed on individual national policies, with scope<lb/> for further consideration of their aggregate area-wide impacts. Furthermore, despite strengthened<lb/> enforcement provisions of the preventive arm, those of the EDP remain more visible. As a result,<lb/> policymakers often focus on the 3% of GDP deficit threshold, risking procyclical policy responses. With<lb/> Treaty changes unlikely in the coming years (<ref type="biblio">Juncker et al., 2015; European Commission, 2015c</ref>), the<lb/> short-term challenge is to ensure a sound application of the current SGP rules. In particular, degrees of<lb/> freedom afforded by the rules should be used by countries with fiscal space to contribute to a more<lb/> supportive joint euro area fiscal stance.<lb/></p>

			<head>The preventive arm: ensuring an appropriate area-wide fiscal stance<lb/></head>

			<p>In setting the structural balance trajectory towards the medium-term objective (MTO), the preventive<lb/> arm contains some welcome flexibility, on which the Commission has recently provided detailed guidance<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2015d</ref>). The required annual fiscal adjustment depends on cyclical conditions, and<lb/> can sometimes be waived, such as when real GDP growth is negative. In some cases, there can be<lb/> temporary deviations from the MTO or the consolidation plan towards it to accommodate the short-term<lb/> fiscal costs of major structural reforms, including certain kinds of investment. These provisions minimise<lb/> the extent of pro-cyclical policies and may ease reform implementation (<ref type="biblio">Beetsma and Debrun, 2004</ref>). Rule<lb/> enforcement allows for some margins of tolerance, since a deviation from the MTO or the path towards it<lb/> is regarded as significant (giving rise to a warning to the country concerned and to subsequent enforcement<lb/> steps) only if it reaches at least 0.5% of GDP in one year, or 0.25% on average in two consecutive years.<lb/></p>

			<p>With negative GDP growth, coupling the no adjustment requirement with possible leeway on<lb/> investment grounds and with the enforcement margin would allow some fiscal expansion, but care would<lb/> be needed to avoid stretching the margin and thus undermining the credibility of the rules. If medium-term<lb/> fiscal sustainability is preserved, countries may be allowed to temporarily deviate from the adjustment path<lb/> towards the MTO in periods of severe area-wide economic downturn. This provision, introduced in 2011<lb/> following the coordinated expansion of 2008-09, has never been applied so far, and could offer a legal<lb/> basis for countercyclical policies were the euro area to fall back into recession.<lb/> As cyclical conditions improve and more countries leave the EDP, the need for fiscal adjustment<lb/> under the preventive arm will increase. In good times, rules should be strictly enforced to help create fiscal<lb/> space to deal with future downturns. Consolidation should have been done more vigorously in the years<lb/> before the global financial crisis (<ref type="biblio">Eyraud and Wu, 2015</ref>), when the euro area aggregate fiscal stance was<lb/> essentially neutral (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>; <ref type="biblio">Carnot and Castro, 2015</ref>). In bad times, national fiscal policies should take<lb/> account of cross-country spillovers (<ref type="biblio">Goujard, 2013</ref>) and, within SGP rules, contribute to supporting euro<lb/> area aggregate demand.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Fiscal policy and cyclical conditions in the euro area<lb/> 1<lb/> As a percentage of potential GDP<lb/> 1.<lb/> Euro area member countries that are also members of the OECD (15 countries).<lb/> Source: OECD (2016), OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the current weak recovery, countries should take advantage of the flexibility afforded by preventive<lb/> arm rules to temporarily slow down or halt consolidation efforts and, if fiscal space under SGP rules exists,<lb/> adopt a temporary fiscal expansion. Adopting structural reforms in tax and spending policies to make<lb/> public finances more growth-friendly and thus enhance long-term sustainability would be desirable in its<lb/> own right and would also ease exploitation of the flexibility provisions. In this vein, priorities should<lb/> include increasing public investment, especially on trans-European networks, and decreasing taxation on<lb/> low wages.<lb/></p>

			<figure>2004<lb/> 2005<lb/> 2006<lb/> 2007<lb/> 2008<lb/> 2009<lb/> 2010<lb/> 2011<lb/> 2012<lb/> 2013<lb/> 2014<lb/> 2015<lb/> -1.5<lb/> -1.0<lb/> -0.5<lb/> 0.0<lb/> 0.5<lb/> 1.0<lb/> 1.5<lb/> 2.0<lb/> -1.5<lb/> -1.0<lb/> -0.5<lb/> 0.0<lb/> 0.5<lb/> 1.0<lb/> 1.5<lb/> 2.0<lb/> -4<lb/> -3<lb/> -2<lb/> -1<lb/> 0<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> Change in the underlying primary<lb/> balance (% points)<lb/> Output gap<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)40<lb/></figure>

			<p>If the recovery weakens significantly and the risk of a new recession looms, more widespread<lb/> temporary fiscal expansion under the clause for severe area-wide economic downturns should be<lb/> considered. Countries where a temporary fiscal easing would not threaten debt sustainability would adopt<lb/> an expansionary stance, modulated according to fiscal space, while others would aim at a broadly neutral<lb/> policy stance. In line with its remit (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2015e</ref>), the recently announced European<lb/> Fiscal Board would be well placed to advise on the applicability of the clause for severe downturns and,<lb/> more generally, on the appropriate area-wide fiscal stance and how it should translate into national fiscal<lb/> stances. A bleaker macroeconomic outlook would only increase the urgency of growth-enhancing reforms<lb/> in revenue and spending composition.<lb/></p>

			<head>The corrective arm: avoiding excessive adjustment and strengthening incentives for reform<lb/></head>

			<p>In the corrective arm, large adjustments induced by the debt reduction benchmark should be avoided.<lb/> The benchmark requires that the excess of the debt ratio over 60% of GDP be reduced at an average 1/20th<lb/> per year (assessed over three-year periods, and with transitional provisions for countries which were under<lb/> an EDP in November 2011). For highly indebted countries, these fiscal adjustments can be very large, far<lb/> exceeding preventive arm requirements. Italy, for instance, would have needed a cumulative structural<lb/> effort of around 3 per cent of GDP over 2013-15 (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2015f</ref>), broadly similar to the<lb/> post-crisis effort (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), which would have threatened the recovery.<lb/> In the cases it has examined so far (Belgium and Italy), the Commission took account of expected<lb/> compliance with preventive arm requirements and expected implementation of ambitious structural<lb/> reforms, as well as of unfavourable economic conditions (especially low inflation), and decided not to open<lb/> an EDP (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2015f, 2015g</ref>). A similar approach should be taken in forthcoming cases,<lb/> as other highly indebted countries leave the EDP and become subject to the debt reduction benchmark. In a<lb/> future SGP revision, the appropriate speed of adjustment towards the 60% of GDP debt threshold should<lb/> be reviewed (see below).<lb/> Compared to the preventive arm, flexibility under the corrective arm is far more limited. The<lb/> corrective arm requires an annual structural balance adjustment of at least 0.5% of GDP, regardless of<lb/> cyclical developments and structural reform implementation, and setting a deadline for eliminating the<lb/> excessive deficit. The adjustment requirement may imply pro-cyclical policies and is only consistent with<lb/> an ex ante deadline if output developments play out as forecast. Longer deadlines are the main provisions<lb/> for flexibility, and deadline extensions have been used intensively (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Though often justified in<lb/> economic terms, extensions are still a second-best tool, as they potentially undermine the credibility of the<lb/> SGP.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9. Extension of deadlines for eliminating excessive deficits<lb/> 1<lb/> 1.<lb/> Council decision on existence of excessive deficit made in 2009 (2010 for Finland).<lb/> 2.<lb/> Austria, Finland, Germany, Italy and Slovak Republic<lb/> Source: European Commission (2015), Report on Public Finances in EMU 2015, European Economy Institutional Papers, No. 014.<lb/> 0<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> 0<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> Other EA²<lb/> Belgium<lb/> Netherlands<lb/> Slovenia<lb/> Ireland<lb/> Portugal<lb/> France<lb/> Spain<lb/> Greece<lb/> Number of extensions<lb/> Number of additional years since initial deadline<lb/></figure>

			<p>Under these constraints, it is important to strengthen incentives for reforms of spending and tax<lb/> policies and of national budget frameworks. Building on recent steps (European Commission, 2015d), the<lb/> Commission could make greater use of longer initial deadlines to provide incentives for major public<lb/> finance reforms. Deadline extensions could also be granted for this purpose, conditional on satisfactory<lb/> fiscal adjustment prior to that point. As envisaged, the reforms considered should go beyond those<lb/> introducing a multi-pillar pension system, which have in practice enjoyed a privileged treatment since the<lb/> 2005 revision of the SGP (<ref type="biblio">Eyraud and Wu, 2015</ref>). Greater emphasis should also be given to the quality of<lb/> national budgetary frameworks (an aspect already contemplated in current legislation) when taking EDP<lb/> steps.<lb/></p>

			<head>Simplifying the assessment of fiscal effort<lb/></head>

			<p>The concept of structural fiscal adjustment is a key tool for both the preventive and corrective arms,<lb/> but has become a source of complexity. As it is difficult to agree on a unique definition of &quot; structural &quot; ,<lb/> alternative indicators to measure fiscal adjustment, aiming to complement the structural budget balance,<lb/> have proliferated. As a result, progress towards the MTO is also reviewed in the light of the so-called<lb/> expenditure benchmark, which sets a growth rate for a spending aggregate net of discretionary revenue<lb/> measures (see below). As for the EDP, the assessment of effective action resorts, in more complex cases, to<lb/> two different measures of adjusted fiscal effort, obtained through top-down and bottom-up approaches.<lb/> Moving towards a single indicator across both SGP arms would help reduce complexity and increase<lb/> transparency. Commendably, efforts to this end have recently been announced (European Commission,<lb/> 2015c).<lb/> If well designed, a single indicator along the lines of the expenditure benchmark could have the<lb/> additional advantage of supporting national expenditure rules. The expenditure benchmark has some<lb/> welcome features: it preserves national discretion over the size of government (for instance, expenditure is<lb/> allowed to grow faster if accompanied by revenue-raising measures), and defines expenditure growth with<lb/> reference to potential rather than actual GDP, which avoids pro-cyclicality. However, it is based on a<lb/> complex spending aggregate, which nets out not only interest payments (a common exclusion) but also<lb/> some components of unemployment benefits, public investment and other government expenditure. By<lb/> comparison, countries like the Netherlands and Sweden, which were among the first to adopt expenditure<lb/> rules, use spending aggregates with less exclusions. A simpler expenditure benchmark would ease<lb/> medium-term expenditure programming at national level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Avenues for medium-term SGP reform<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the medium term, SGP rules should be improved along two main axes. First, to reduce<lb/> complexity and asymmetries in enforcement, the preventive and corrective arms could be more closely<lb/> aligned and possibly merged, giving rise to a single set of targets, procedures and indicators. Second, the<lb/> current multiplicity of numerical rules could be replaced by a single fiscal anchor underpinned by a single<lb/> operational rule (<ref type="biblio">Andrle et al., 2015</ref>). The natural anchor is the public debt-to-GDP ratio in each country,<lb/> given its direct link to fiscal sustainability. The appropriate speed of debt reduction could take account of<lb/> cyclical conditions in each country (as is now the case for fiscal adjustment under the preventive arm) as<lb/> well as in the euro area as a whole. Countries would then specify their own operational rules (for instance,<lb/> deficit or expenditure rules) which should include a debt correction mechanism, thus reinforcing national<lb/> budget frameworks. These reforms would imply very substantial legislative changes, including to the<lb/> Treaty. The spring 2017 White Paper envisaged in the Five Presidents&apos; Report (<ref type="biblio">Juncker et al., 2015</ref>) offers<lb/> an opportunity to start preparatory work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reinforcing national budgetary frameworks<lb/></head>

			<p>Budget frameworks at the national level play a key role in making public finances more supportive of<lb/> equitable growth and the procedures and institutions involved in preparing, approving and executing<lb/> budgets are highly country-specific. For instance, the effectiveness of numerical rules targeting broad<lb/> public finance aggregates hinges on their alignment with the medium-term strategic priorities of<lb/> government (OECD, 2015d), and is fostered by top-down budgeting, a multi-year horizon, and<lb/> performance-informed allocations and management at programme level.<lb/> The SGP reform of 2011-13 included several provisions to strengthen national fiscal frameworks. The<lb/> Six-Pack Directive on budgetary frameworks (2011) and the Two Pack and Fiscal Compact (2013) set<lb/> requirements in a broad range of areas, including numerical fiscal rules, independent fiscal institutions,<lb/> medium-term budgetary frameworks and budget reporting and transparency. Important strides have been<lb/> made in some areas, such as the coverage and timeliness of budget statistics and the creation of<lb/> independent fiscal institutions in virtually all euro area countries. However, overall budget reform activity<lb/> across the euro area since late 2011, as assessed by the OECD, has been generally modest (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>).<lb/> Though further progress primarily depends on national governments and parliaments, European institutions<lb/> can foster reform by enforcing legal obligations, such as the correct transposition of relevant EU law, and<lb/> through peer-pressure and a greater weight given to the quality of national frameworks when applying SGP<lb/> rules.<lb/></p>

			<head>National expenditure rules and spending reviews should be more widely used<lb/></head>

			<p>Limited budget reforms are apparent as regards fiscal rules. The 2011 Directive required country-<lb/>specific numerical rules, and the Fiscal Compact required transposing the medium-term objective and the<lb/> adjustment path towards it into national law. This last requirement helps to explain why in recent years<lb/> progress in the adoption of national fiscal rules by euro area countries was strongest for budget balance<lb/> rules. However, when rules of supranational origin are excluded, several euro area countries are still<lb/> classified as not having any numerical fiscal rules in place at the level of central government, general<lb/></p>

			<p>government or the public sector (<ref type="biblio">Schaechter et al., 2012; Bova et al., 2015</ref>). Modest progress is also<lb/> apparent if one considers expenditure rules, for which there are no transposition requirements in the SGP:<lb/> in 2014, only five euro area countries had in place expenditure rules covering more than half of general<lb/> government finances, compared to four in 2010 (European Commission&apos;s Fiscal Governance database).<lb/> Expenditure rules strike a balance between sustainability and stabilisation objectives, especially when<lb/> supplemented with a correction mechanism that reacts to deviations of debt from its target (<ref type="biblio">Andrle et al.,<lb/> 2015</ref>). Automatic stabilisers, mostly on the revenue side, are largely allowed to operate. Relative to a<lb/> structural balance rule, an expenditure rule is simpler, easier to communicate and less vulnerable to real-<lb/>time measurement error, since potential output is difficult to estimate in real time and estimates have been<lb/> subject to large ex post revisions. Last but not least, aggregate expenditure ceilings can provide a better<lb/> anchor to the determination of annual spending allocations, and thus facilitate reforms, which are discussed<lb/> next, to increase the efficiency of public spending at sectoral or programme level. Communication and<lb/> transparency of the spending rule is important to its credibility, and in this light monitoring of compliance<lb/> with the rule should be entrusted to an independent fiscal institution, as required by the SGP.<lb/> Spending reviews have the potential to yield important gains as regards the composition and<lb/> efficiency of government outlays. Through systematic scrutiny of baseline expenditure, prioritisation can<lb/> be improved and spending reductions, if needed, can be made more sustainable, notably through efficiency<lb/> gains (<ref type="biblio">Robinson, 2014</ref>). Furthermore, when integrated into the regular process of budget preparation,<lb/> spending reviews can support adherence to aggregate spending ceilings, and foster the development of<lb/> performance-informed budgeting. Successful spending reviews are nonetheless a complex tool, requiring<lb/> cooperation between finance and spending ministries and sustained high-level political commitment for<lb/> recommendations to be translated into policy decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>These difficulties help explain why successful implementation of spending reviews remains limited.<lb/> Resort to this tool has rapidly increased in the wake of the global financial crisis, with about half of OECD<lb/> countries (and, within these, a similar proportion of euro area members) reporting some sort of spending<lb/> review in place in 2011 (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2011; Robinson, 2014</ref>). Nonetheless, publicly available information on<lb/> these reviews, notably on implementation of recommendations and ensuing savings, is fragmented and<lb/> heterogeneous, and independent monitoring remains relatively scarce (<ref type="biblio">Vandierendonck, 2014</ref>), as does the<lb/> reviews&apos; integration into the regular budget process. Countries should conduct spending reviews on a<lb/> regular basis, ensuring a systematic link to budget preparation as well as independent monitoring of<lb/> ensuing results. Peer-review exercises, such as those organised by the European Commission in 2014<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Vandierendonck, 2014</ref>), can be a valuable tool to promote the exchange of good practices.<lb/></p>

			<head>Independent fiscal institutions should be given conditions to operate effectively<lb/></head>

			<p>Euro area countries are required by the SGP to have independent fiscal institutions that monitor<lb/> compliance with fiscal rules, with a special emphasis on those enshrining the medium-term objective in<lb/> national legislation. Independent institutions should also prepare or assess the macroeconomic forecasts<lb/> used in annual and multi-year fiscal plans. These requirements are strongly reflected in the remit of<lb/> existing institutions (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>), more than half of which started activity after 2011.<lb/></p>

Remit and resources of independent fiscal institutions: selected features<lb/> 1<lb/> Per cent<lb/> 1.<lb/> Only one independent fiscal institution per country is counted in the few cases where more than one exists; a given item is<lb/> considered to be verified if it holds for at least one of the national insititutions</figure>

Debrun et al., (2013), &quot; The Functions and Impact of Fiscal<lb/> Councils &quot; , IMF Policy Paper, 16 July, International Monetary Fund.<lb/></table>

			<p>The tasks entrusted to national independent fiscal institutions could be usefully extended beyond those<lb/> mandated by the SGP. An example is the quantification of budgetary and economic impacts of measures<lb/> and reforms (costing of measures), as often done by similar institutions outside the EU (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). Like<lb/> rule monitoring and forecast production or assessment, carrying out cost estimates of measures is also<lb/> associated with lower primary deficits (<ref type="biblio">Debrun and Kinda, 2014</ref>). Further, it would contribute to a more<lb/> informed debate on, and potentially better design of, structural reforms with direct budget implications,<lb/> thereby improving the composition and efficiency of public finances.<lb/> It is also essential that independent fiscal institutions be provided with conditions for a credible<lb/> fulfilment of their mandate, in terms of resources, access to information and the broader institutional<lb/> environment. Institutions in euro area countries tend to compare unfavourably in terms of having staff<lb/> commensurate to tasks (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>), and staff needs would generally increase if institutions were tasked<lb/> with policy costing, as this requires sector and programme-specific expertise. Further, institutions in euro<lb/> area countries often lack strong safeguards on their budget, such as multiannual funding commitments,<lb/> which would further enhance the independence of those bodies (OECD, 2014b). Full and timely access to<lb/> relevant information should also be ensured. Though a legal obligation to share information essential for<lb/> the institutions&apos; activity is often in place, less than half of those institutions in EU countries enjoy full<lb/> access to non-public budgetary information (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2014</ref>). Finally, relations between the<lb/> new advisory European Fiscal Board and national independent fiscal institutions should be organised in a<lb/> mutually-reinforcing way, as planned, thus avoiding to undermine the scope of action and credibility of the<lb/> latter.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical information can be improved further<lb/></head>

			<p>Further progress in public sector statistics would reinforce risk analysis and management, which is a<lb/> key input for assessing debt sustainability. High-quality budget reporting has been highlighted as an<lb/> important principle of fiscal governance (IMF, 2014a; OECD, 2015d). So has sound fiscal risk analysis<lb/> and management, which requires comprehensive information on public sector units and on contingent<lb/> liabilities. Since 2011, considerable progress has been made. Eurostat&apos;s auditing powers have been<lb/> strengthened and the coverage and timeliness of general government accounts improved, with monthly<lb/> cash-based or equivalent data now available (quarterly in the case of local government) and a more<lb/> transparent transition from cash-based to accrual (national accounts) data. As for general government<lb/> contingent liabilities and non-performing loans, annual reporting has been introduced, but further efforts<lb/> are needed to improve detail, timeliness (quarterly releases would be desirable) and coverage. Coverage<lb/> particularly needs to be improved in the case of liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SoEs), where data<lb/> limitations sometimes reflect a still incomplete delimitation of the public sector (formed by the general<lb/> government and SoEs), especially at the level of local government. It would also be helpful to have<lb/> complete accounts (and not just debt) for the public sector as a whole, which would require separate<lb/> identification of SoEs and private firms in national accounts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policies towards more effective public investment<lb/></head>

			<p>Both European and national policy levers play a key role in ensuring enough and efficient spending<lb/> on public investment. The EU&apos;s own budget funds for investment and other growth-enhancing expenditure,<lb/> such as on education and active labour market programmes, stand at 0.5% of EU GDP. This amount is<lb/> arguably too low if account is taken of the potential for generating economies of scale and positive<lb/> externalities, for example from research and development (R&amp;D) or infrastructure. However, even these<lb/> limited resources can have a leveraged impact on the composition and efficiency of public finances if<lb/> deployed in a way to crowd in national public funds and private investment, and foster greater investment<lb/> productivity. At national level, better coordination of investment across levels of government and upgraded<lb/> administrative capacity would increase investment efficiency.<lb/></p>

			<head>Making EU budget expenditure more growth-friendly<lb/></head>

			<p>The structure of EU budget expenditure has become more growth-friendly over time, but there<lb/> remains large scope for improvement. Funds aimed at investment and growth currently account for close to<lb/> half of total EU-level spending (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, &quot; Smart and inclusive growth &quot; ). Among these, geographically-<lb/>allocated European regional policy has accounted for about one third of total spending since the turn of the<lb/> century. &quot; Competitiveness for growth and jobs &quot; programmes are directly managed at European level (there<lb/> are no country-specific allocations) and include the research and innovation Horizon 2020 and the<lb/> Connecting Europe Facility (targeted at trans-European networks). Their weight in the budget has roughly<lb/> doubled since the nineties but is still less than half the share of agricultural subsidies. Resource constraints<lb/> were well illustrated by the unfortunate need to partly fund the Investment Plan for Europe (discussed<lb/> below) with allocations taken from Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility, streams of spending<lb/> that are also critical for boosting European growth potential.<lb/></p>

			<head>Source: European Commission (2014), European Union: Public Finance, 5th Edition.<lb/></head>

			<p>In the short term, and in particular in the budget review foreseen for 2017, it is essential to preserve<lb/> investment and growth allocations in the face of pressures on other fronts, such as the refugee crisis.<lb/> Unlike spending allocated to countries, investment and R&amp;D programmes managed at EU level become<lb/> potential targets for savings. In the longer term, post-2020 financial frameworks should continue to<lb/> increase resources for growth-enhancing expenditure. This can be funded by either reallocation of<lb/> expenditure or an increase in the overall EU budget size, reversing the unprecedented reduction in real<lb/> terms agreed for 2014-20.<lb/></p>

			<head>European regional policy: making the best of conditionality requirements<lb/></head>

			<p>European regional policy can be a powerful tool to increase the quality of public finances in the less<lb/> prosperous EU countries, where receipts of European structural and investment funds reach<lb/> macroeconomic significance (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). Those funds can improve the composition of public spending,<lb/> since they are targeted to growth and equity-friendly investments, such as on transport and network<lb/> infrastructures, R&amp;D, education or active labour market policies. Furthermore, support to and compliance<lb/> with sound institutional frameworks will tend to enhance the efficiency of the expenditure concerned<lb/> (Rodriguez-<ref type="biblio">Pose and Garcilazo, 2013</ref>).<lb/> To maximise the benefits, it is essential to ensure that EU funding adds to, rather than replaces,<lb/> national public spending (the so-called additionality). In the 2014-20 period, compliance with additionality<lb/> requires that countries achieve minimum levels of public investment. However, enforcement mechanisms<lb/> have been reinforced only gradually, and remain weak. Possible sanctions appear late in the process (not<lb/> before 2022 for the 2014-20 period) and are relatively light. For instance, if public investment falls short of<lb/> the levels required for compliance by 20%, only a modest 1.7% of the structural funds received for the less<lb/> developed regions of the country concerned may have to be given back. Furthermore, especially for euro<lb/> area countries, the compliance levels look often unambitious: they imply an increase in the share of<lb/> European funds in total public investment (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>), and therefore a decline in the relative contribution<lb/> of national funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>Current rules for additionality should be credibly enforced, starting with the 2018 mid-term<lb/> verification, where increasing the investment levels required could be considered. In future programming<lb/> periods, more ambitious levels should likewise be envisaged, and possible sanctions brought to an earlier<lb/> stage. Compliance indicators could also be improved further. For 2014-20, gross fixed capital formation of<lb/> general government, as defined in national accounts, has replaced previous ad hoc indicators, with gains in<lb/> terms of simplification and transparency. However, given that a significant part of expenditure supported<lb/> by structural funds is not classified as gross fixed capital formation of general government, a broader set of<lb/> indicators could be considered, while preserving the principle of relying on readily available, standardised<lb/> data.<lb/> To support institutional quality and investment efficiency, conditionality requirements have been<lb/> generally reinforced in the 2014-20 period. Numerous ex ante conditionalities need to be met before the<lb/> disbursement of funds, either of a general nature (such as compliance with public procurement rules) or of<lb/> a thematic one (such as the existence of national strategies in specific sectors). Further, macroeconomic<lb/> conditionality aims to reinforce consistency between European structural and investment funding and key<lb/> elements of EU economic governance. For instance, to better address country-specific recommendations,<lb/> the Commission may request countries to reprogramme structural and investment funds, and to propose a<lb/> suspension of payments in the absence of a satisfactory national response. Untested so far, this<lb/> conditionality could improve the alignment of funds with relevant structural reforms. However, as in the<lb/> case of ex ante conditionalities, preserving national ownership of reforms and other requirements is<lb/> essential.<lb/> In other cases, however, macroeconomic conditionality may be counterproductive. For example, the<lb/> Commission must propose a suspension of structural funds when the Council assesses that no effective<lb/> action has been taken to correct an excessive deficit. Though modulated in the light of economic and social<lb/> conditions, suspended amounts will be at least in the range of 0.25% to 0.5% of GDP (or 25% to 50% of<lb/> annual structural and investment funding if lower). This suspension will be lifted and re-budgeted as soon<lb/> as the Member State has adopted the necessary corrective action. Nevertheless, under fiscal stress, these<lb/> sanctions would likely worsen the composition of public expenditure by compounding downward<lb/> pressures on public investment and other growth-enhancing items, and should therefore in most cases be<lb/> avoided.<lb/></p>

			<head>Leveraging private sector investment<lb/></head>

			<p>Announced in November 2014, the Investment Plan for Europe aims at generating at least<lb/> EUR 315 billion (2.2% of 2015 EU GDP) of additional investment over three years, mainly from private<lb/> sources and with a focus on infrastructure, innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).<lb/> The Plan&apos;s funding pillar, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), allows the European<lb/> Investment Bank (EIB) Group to finance projects that would not have been supported otherwise. The EFSI<lb/> is endowed with a risk-absorbing capacity of EUR 21 billion: EUR 5 billion from EIB resources, and an<lb/> EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion. Decisions on the use of this guarantee to support specific projects are<lb/> made by an independent Investment Committee. No member state made financial contributions to the<lb/> EFSI, but several have already committed to provide co-financing to investments, mainly via national<lb/> promotional banks. It will be important to ensure that these commitments represent additional public<lb/> investment. Under certain conditions, national authorities will also be able to combine European structural<lb/> and investment funds with EFSI support to enhance risk-bearing capacity and thus the ability to attract<lb/> private sector financing (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2016</ref>).<lb/> The Plan also comprises pillars of project promotion and technical assistance, and of structural<lb/> reforms. The European Investment Project Portal will advertise potential investment opportunities<lb/> submitted by public or private promoters, while the European Investment Advisory Hub, already<lb/> operational, offers a single point of contact for technical assistance. Structural reforms to create an<lb/> investment-friendly environment are discussed in Strasky (2016). A case in point, essential to unlock<lb/> investment and complete the Single Market, is the reduction of regulatory heterogeneity across Europe.<lb/> The amount of EFSI-supported investment carried out so far has been small, providing negligible<lb/> short-run stimulus to activity. Project submission and approval has nonetheless been progressing in line<lb/> with the target in recent months, and about EUR 12.8 billion of EIB Group resources have already been<lb/> committed by mid-May 2016, which are expected to trigger total investment of around EUR 100 billion in<lb/> the coming years.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given limited public resources, the medium-term success of the Plan will hinge on its ability to<lb/> leverage private investment, for which the EIB Group&apos;s lending behaviour and the quality of the projects<lb/> presented will be key. The EUR 315 billion investment target presupposes a multiplier of 15: the EFSI<lb/> guarantee should enable three times as much EIB Group funding, which will be used to finance an average<lb/> 20% of investment projects (the remainder coming from additional investors, with a large role played by<lb/> the private sector). This requires selecting projects which are attractive for additional co-funding and (to<lb/> avoid crowding-out) which would not otherwise be carried out. Crowding in private investment on the<lb/> scale envisaged also requires that the EIB Group depart from its usual very prudent lending practices,<lb/> characterised by a choice of low-risk projects and negligible levels of non-performing loans (<ref type="biblio">Claeys,<lb/> 2015</ref>). This implies accepting projects with higher risk than in the past, and financing on average a lower<lb/> share of each (one-fifth, in line with the envisaged multiplier, rather than the traditional one-third to<lb/> one-half).<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving public investment governance<lb/></head>

			<p>At national level, stepping up efforts to coordinate investment among tiers of government is essential.<lb/> Across the OECD, sub-national governments account for about 60% of total public investment (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>),<lb/> highlighting the need for vertical and horizontal coordination mechanisms (OECD, 2013; OECD, 2014c).<lb/> However, for reasons such as informational asymmetries, non-aligned objectives, poor capacity or<lb/> inadequate funding arrangements, effective coordination is difficult. Among 15 dimensions of institutional<lb/> quality for efficient public investment management, central-local coordination is the one where advanced<lb/> economies tend to fare worst (IMF, 2015b). In a recent survey on infrastructure investment, more than<lb/> three quarters of EU sub-national governments reported coordination challenges across the national and<lb/> subnational levels. <ref type="biblio">Challenges</ref> in horizontal coordination across jurisdictions are also prominent in the<lb/> survey results (OECD and Committee of Regions, 2015).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)40<lb/> Figure 15. Share of sub-national governments in total public investment<lb/> 1<lb/> Per cent, 2015<lb/> 2<lb/> 1.<lb/> Gross fixed capital formation.<lb/> 2.<lb/> 2014 for Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland and United States; 2013 for Mexico; and 2011 for<lb/> Turkey.<lb/> 3.<lb/> Includes local government for Australia and the United States.<lb/> Source: OECD (2016), &quot; General Government Accounts, SNA 2008 &quot; , OECD National Accounts Statistics (database).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Potential tools to foster coordination include bringing together different jurisdictions in dialogue fora<lb/> with actual involvement in decision-making, co-financing and conditionality mechanisms, and the<lb/> promotion of collaboration between sub-national governments through the removal of legal and regulatory<lb/> barriers, possibly coupled with financial incentives (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2013; OECD, 2015e</ref>). For the 2014-20 period,<lb/> EU regional policy has developed tools to promote coordination, such as integrated territorial investments,<lb/> which bring together different funding lines to implement an integrated strategy in a specific territory.<lb/> Delegation of management tasks to local and regional authorities is allowed, and, in some cases, even<lb/> mandatory. Better coordination among sub-national governments will also enhance their ability to promote<lb/> sound investment projects under the Investment Plan for Europe.<lb/> Public administration capacity is also essential for efficient investment, but is often inadequate,<lb/> especially at sub-national level and in particular in lagging regions. There is wide variation in the perceived<lb/> quality of sub-national governments across the EU, and within some countries (<ref type="biblio">Charron et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> Capacity challenges have been identified at various stages of the investment cycle, including long-term<lb/> strategic planning, the ability to involve the private sector (for instance through public-private<lb/> partnerships) and public procurement (OECD, 2013). Aware of these weaknesses, EU regional policy has<lb/> included the enhancement of administrative capacity among its ex ante conditionalities for the 2014-20<lb/> period, with an accompanying increase in financial support for this purpose. A recent proposal for a<lb/> Structural Reform Support Programme (European Commission, 2015h) will also support capacity building,<lb/> namely through technical assistance. National authorities should prioritise actions to preserve and develop<lb/> administrative capacity at different levels of government in response to the main gaps detected and with a<lb/> special focus on the weakest regions. In times of fiscal restraint, these considerations should inform the<lb/> design of fiscal consolidation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Additional recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Include in the remit of national independent fiscal institutions estimating the costs of proposed policies.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> To reduce complexity, adopt a single indicator to measure structural fiscal adjustment under different<lb/> SGP rules and procedures. Ensure that the chosen indicator does not hamper medium-term expenditure<lb/> programming at national level.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Further improve the coverage and timeliness of statistical data on general government contingent<lb/> liabilities, especially as regards state-owned enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<head>Protecting public investment and increasing its efficiency<lb/> Key recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> As intended in the Investment Plan for Europe, the European Investment Bank should finance higher-risk<lb/> projects that would not otherwise be carried out.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Countries should increase targeted public support to investment while enhancing the framework<lb/> conditions for private investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Additional recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Preserve EU budget resources for investment and growth in the face of short-term pressures on other<lb/> fronts. In the future, continue to increase growth-enhancing expenditure in the EU budget, if possible by<lb/> granting higher resources to the European Union.<lb/></p>

			<head><lb/></head>

			<p>Credibly enforce current rules to ensure that EU structural and investment funds add to, rather than<lb/> replace, national public spending.
