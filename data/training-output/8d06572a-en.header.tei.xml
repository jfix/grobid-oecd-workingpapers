The<lb/> Organisation&apos;s core mission today is to help governments work together towards a stronger, cleaner, fairer<lb/> global economy. Through its network of 250 specialised committees and working groups, the OECD<lb/> provides a setting where governments compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems,<lb/> identify good practice, and co-ordinate domestic and international policies.<lb/> The OECD member countries are:</p>

	<div type="abstract">as the OECD forum for exchange, and for monitoring policies and<lb/> structural changes affecting the development of domestic and international tourism.<lb/> Addressing the major challenges faced by the tourism industry, and maximising tourism&apos;s full<lb/> economic potential, requires an integrated and multi-faceted approach to tourism policy development<lb/> across many government levels and departments. In this environment, OECD members see considerable<lb/> benefit in co-operating to address economic, sustainability and employment issues, and promote tourism<lb/> policy performance and evaluation, innovation and liberalisation of tourism. A closer co-operation with<lb/> major emerging economies is also seen as being critical to achieving a strong impact with this work.<lb/> The website of the Tourism Committee (www.oecd.org/cfe/tourism/) provides detailed information<lb/> about the OECD activities on Tourism.<lb/> 4 © OECD – FINANCING APPROACHES FOR TOURISM SMES AND ENTREPRENEURS<lb/> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<lb/> Jane Stacey co-ordinated and led the drafting of this report, under the direction of Alain Dupeyras,<lb/> Head of the OECD Tourism Unit.

The perspectives of national tourism administrations, public financing agencies and<lb/> institutions, and the tourism industry are captured. Contributions were received from national industry<lb/> associations and members of the business association representing the European hospitality industry,<lb/> HOTREC, in Austria, France and Poland, and financial services company UniCredit Italy. Members of the<lb/> European Association of Guarantee Institutions (AECM) also provided inputs (BpiFrance, ETEAN<lb/> Greece).<lb/> create a secondary market in conjunction with a newly-established trading platform for shares in<lb/> syndicates, Syndex (www.syndex.exchange/).<lb/> The Government is monitoring developments in both the peer-to-peer lending and equity<lb/> crowdfunding markets to determine how these sources of capital are accessed by SMEs. The Financial<lb/> Markets Authority will evaluate the impacts of the changes that came with Financial Markets Conduct Act<lb/> 2013 reforms.<lb/> Key points<lb/>  Both peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding have been effective. They have expanded the<lb/> capital raising options available to individuals and SMEs.<lb/>  A critical factor in the success of the reforms has been in providing sufficient operating freedom<lb/> which allows both schemes to be accessed by a wide range of investors and borrowers.<lb/>  It appears that the uptake by tourism SMEs has so far been limited. However, it seems reasonable<lb/> to assume that tourism SMEs will access these forms of financing approaches as time develops<lb/> and these approaches become more well-known.<lb/>  Both regimes are relatively new features of New Zealand&apos;s capital raising landscape. The<lb/> Government will continue to monitor the development of both peer-to-peer lending and equity<lb/> crowdfunding to consider whether changes to the existing regimes are needed.<lb/> Conditions for transferability<lb/> Since coming to prominence over the last 10 years, internet-based equity crowdfunding and peer-to-<lb/>peer lending are relatively innovative finance techniques whose use is by now widespread. These internet-<lb/>based tools are private-based initiatives; the public sector intervention comes in the regulation of their<lb/> operation and activities.<lb/> For more information:<lb/> Contact: Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment<lb/> https://fma.govt.nz/consumers/ways-to-invest/crowdfunding/<lb/> http://www.interest.co.nz/saving/crowdfunding<lb/> https://fma.govt.nz/consumers/ways-to-invest/peer-to-peer/<lb/> www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2014/0326/latest/DLM6292901.html<lb/> PORTUGAL – INCUBATION PROGRAMME TO FOSTER ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION IN TOURISM<lb/> © OECD – FINANCING APPROACHES FOR TOURISM SMES AND ENTREPRENEURS 57</p>
