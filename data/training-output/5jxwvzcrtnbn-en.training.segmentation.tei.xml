			<front>EXPLORING POLICY COMPLEMENTARITIES IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES: <lb/>THE CASE OF KAZAKHSTAN <lb/>By Jibran J Punthakey 1 <lb/>OECD Eurasia Competitiveness Programme, Global Relations Secretariat <lb/>Abstract: <lb/>Policy complementarities have often been overlooked in transition economies, leading to the <lb/>exclusion or partial adoption of reforms. This paper examines the key determinants of successful <lb/>transition strategies, and concludes that an approach exploiting complementary relationships and <lb/>interactions between policies is most likely to result in a welfare improvement. Based on nine policy <lb/>areas from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Transition Indicators <lb/>database, composite indicators measuring reform implementation and complementarity are <lb/>constructed. Panel data estimates for 30 countries over the period 1989 to 2012 demonstrate a positive <lb/>association between improvements in reform complementarity and economic growth. Moreover, the <lb/>effects are found to persist over time for up to two years after the initial policy change, and are robust <lb/>to the inclusion of a wide range of control variables. Applying these findings to the case of Kazakhstan <lb/>illustrates that comprehensive reforms to a targeted group of complementary policies generate <lb/>sustained increases in output growth, whereas a partial reform strategy results in a loss of welfare. <lb/>JEL classification codes: P2; O40; C33. <lb/>Keywords: Complementarity; structural reforms; reform indicators; economic growth; transition <lb/>economies; panel data; Kazakhstan. <lb/>1. <lb/>OECD Eurasia Competitiveness Programme, Global Relations Secretariat, 2 rue André Pascal, 75775 <lb/>Paris Cedex 16. jibran.punthakey@oecd.org, jibran.punthakey@gmail.com. <lb/>The author would like to acknowledge the considerable guidance and support provided by Dr. <lb/>Joaquim Oliveira Martins, Head of the OECD Regional Development Policy Division, without which <lb/>this study would not have been possible.

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>The economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) 2 and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) 3 <lb/>underwent a profound transition during the 1990s, moving from a governance structure dominated by <lb/>central planning to the adoption of open, market-oriented mechanisms and institutions. As the process <lb/>of economic liberalisation began, many commonalities could be observed across the structural reforms <lb/>that were implemented: countries made efforts to remove barriers to trade, increase capital mobility, <lb/>privatise state-owned businesses and invest in infrastructure. However, with wide differences being <lb/>observed in countries&apos; growth trajectories and development patterns, transition was neither a simple <lb/>nor a speedy panacea for the economic woes of the time. <lb/>How can such stark differences in economic performance be explained? Evidence suggests that <lb/>successful transition strategies are contingent on initial conditions and the speed, sequence and manner <lb/>in which distortions are eased or removed (EBRD, 1994). While initial conditions such as the <lb/>historical context, state of the external environment and quality of the existing policy and institutional <lb/>framework have a determinate impact on economic performance, they are predominantly beyond the <lb/>control of policy makers. On the other hand, the development of a coherent reform strategy that targets <lb/>the most binding constraints to growth is well within reach. <lb/>The idea of identifying the &quot; binding constraints &quot; or prioritising reforms according to the <lb/>magnitude of their direct impact on welfare was put forth by Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco (2005), <lb/>and is motivated primarily by practical considerations. First, governments have limited administrative <lb/>and political capital at their disposal, and are unlikely to be able to implement multiple and inordinate <lb/>reforms within a given electoral cycle. Second, due to incomplete information about the nature of <lb/>current distortions, an immediate liberalisation of all institutions is nearly impossible. And third, <lb/>owing to the potential for adverse second-best outcomes, basing reform selection on political <lb/>feasibility alone is both ill-advised and prone to failure. <lb/>The theory of the second-best contends that reform implementation may reduce growth, due to <lb/>the presence of multiple interaction effects across market distortions (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). If <lb/>the removal of all distortions leads to an unambiguous welfare improvement, the second-best <lb/>hypothesis can be said to lend support to the notion of policy complementarities. Specifically, when a <lb/>single reform results in an unexpected welfare loss, it is conceivable that the selective implementation <lb/>of complementary reforms may be welfare enhancing. For instance, without sufficient flexibility in <lb/>labour markets, trade liberalisation may lead to a sub-optimal allocation of resources and will thus be <lb/>2. <lb/>Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) comprises Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, <lb/>Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, <lb/>Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic and Slovenia. <lb/>3. <lb/>The Former Soviet Union (FSU) comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, <lb/>Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. <lb/>The three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) are included in CEE. <lb/></body>

			<body>ineffective in stimulating growth (Rodrik, 2005). Financial liberalisation is another important <lb/>example: without a stable macroeconomic environment and solid prudential regulations, many <lb/>transition economies were unduly exposed to volatility in international capital markets and a <lb/>heightened risk of systemic crises (Hartwell, 2012). In turn, trade policies and financial sector reform <lb/>also exhibit strong complementarities, as financial intermediaries are often instrumental in assisting <lb/>domestic firms to deal with the adjustment costs associated with increased trade openness (Rodrik, <lb/>2005). <lb/>Mutual interdependencies between reforms in the context of transition were first investigated in <lb/>detail by Gates, Milgrom and Roberts (1994), and the idea has received increasing attention in the <lb/>literature since (e.g. Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins, 2008; Coricelli and Maurel, 2011). In <lb/>spite of these developments, there is no established consensus that policy complementarities should be <lb/>central to the elaboration of a coherent reform strategy. Indeed, Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) <lb/>suggest it is impracticable to give priority to reforms that induce positive second-best effects, as these <lb/>are typically unobservable ex-ante. <lb/>This paper contends that the incremental returns to reform in one area are higher when the reform <lb/>leads to greater complementarity in the overall policy framework. By inference, a reform strategy <lb/>based on maximising policy complementarity (or minimising policy dispersion) is essentially <lb/>consistent with an approach anchored in alleviating the &quot; binding constraints &quot; to growth. This <lb/>perspective is encouraging as it allows the two ideas to coalesce into one theory, which can form the <lb/>basis of a methodology for reform prioritisation. <lb/>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the <lb/>economic and structural transformations that took place during transition, and Section 3 offers a series <lb/>of explanations for the strong variability in output performance observed across the transition region. <lb/>The notion of reform complementarities is explored in detail in section 4, and a methodology is <lb/>developed to measure reform levels and complementarity using composite indicators based on the <lb/>EBRD Transition Indicators database. These indicators are then used to examine trajectories of <lb/>structural change in transition economies, and derive empirical estimates of the relationship between <lb/>reforms, complementarity and growth. Section 6 examines the role of reform complementarities in the <lb/>context of the economic transition in Kazakhstan, and recommends future policy priorities based on a <lb/>predictive scenario analysis. The paper concludes with a summary of the findings and potential <lb/>avenues for further research. <lb/>2. GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES <lb/>The transition from central planning to a market economy prompted a number of significant <lb/>structural transformations pertaining to the systems for resource generation and allocation, institutional <lb/>arrangements for the functioning of markets, and role of the state. Enterprises and households were <lb/>forced to adapt their consumption and production decisions to market-based incentive structures. <lb/>Restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the removal of price controls, subsidies and other <lb/>distortions led to an increase in the private sector&apos;s role in the economy. And governments were faced <lb/>with an entirely new set of responsibilities, requiring the establishment of effective legal and judicial <lb/>structures, the protection of property rights, the development of secure mechanisms for contract <lb/></body>

			<body>enforcement, and the provision of public goods such as infrastructure, education, health and social <lb/>services. <lb/>Although the adjustment costs of transition were widely anticipated, the depth and duration of the <lb/>output loss sustained by most countries exceeded even the most pessimistic of forecasts. The <lb/>experience of transition economies during the 1990s has been likened to that of developed economies <lb/>during the Great Depression (World Bank, 2002), and is comparable to output declines observed <lb/>during periods of civil war (Coricelli and Maurel, 2011). Strong differences were observed in <lb/>economic performance across countries, both in terms of the magnitude of the initial recession and the <lb/>length of the subsequent recovery period. Furthermore, the expectation that the countries that endured <lb/>severe output contractions would recover more rapidly was not met, with a number of economies <lb/>remaining mired in a long-term cycle of negative growth rates that lasted for almost an entire decade. 4 <lb/>Figure 1 illustrates the impact of transition on real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the <lb/>economies of CEE and the FSU. Output fell for five consecutive years in CEE, resulting in a <lb/>cumulative decline of 21 percent between 1989 and 1993. The recovery that ensued lasted for a further <lb/>six years, with income levels finally returning to their 1989 levels in 1999. In contrast, the FSU <lb/>experienced eight consecutive years of falling output, or a cumulative decline of 45 percent between <lb/>1989 and 1996. This was followed by a long, protracted recovery that stalled with the onset of the <lb/>Russian crisis in August 1998, and persisted for a full decade afterwards, with GDP per capita only <lb/>officially surpassing its 1990 level in 2007. Countries in the FSU remain severely exposed to external <lb/>economic shocks, due to the region&apos;s strong reliance on exports of primary commodities. Output is <lb/>highly volatile and contracted by 7 percent in 2009 in response to the global economic downturn, <lb/>compared with just 4 percent in CEE. 5 <lb/>4. <lb/>Output per capita contracted for nine consecutive years in Ukraine, eight consecutive years in Russia <lb/>and Tajikistan, and seven consecutive years in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan. The <lb/>steepest declines were observed in Georgia (77%), Tajikistan (72%), Azerbaijan (66%), Moldova <lb/>(66%) and Ukraine (60%). <lb/>5. <lb/>See Figure 11 in Appendix A for a comparison of GDP per capita growth rates in CEE and the FSU. <lb/></body>

Evolution of real GDP per capita, 1989-2012 <lb/>Note: Regional aggregates are population-weighted. <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s calculations, based on data from the World Bank&apos;s World Development Indicators (WB/WDI). <lb/>Perhaps the most noteworthy consequence of transition was manifested in the emergence of <lb/>privately-owned enterprises, many of which were established through the privatisation of SOEs. <lb/>Figure 2 depicts the progression of the share of GDP accounted for by the private sector in CEE and <lb/>the FSU between 1994 and 2010, based on official country-level estimates from the EBRD. Private <lb/>enterprises are a key ingredient in any market economy, and the extent to which output is generated by <lb/>private enterprises is therefore a salient indicator of progress in transition. As illustrated in Figure 2, <lb/>private sector activity has flourished in CEE, increasing from an average of 50 percent of GDP in 1994 <lb/>to 74 percent of GDP in 2010. In the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and the Slovak Republic, the <lb/>share has remained stable at 80 percent since 2002. On the other hand, the private sector&apos;s share in <lb/>output in the FSU has been stagnant since 1997, at an average of 65 percent (levels as low as 25 and <lb/>30 percent were recorded in Turkmenistan and Belarus in 2010). <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>120 <lb/>140 <lb/>160 <lb/>180 <lb/>Index (1989 = 100) <lb/>Transition Economies <lb/>Central and Eastern Europe <lb/>Former Soviet Union <lb/></body>

Share of private sector in GDP, 1994-2010 <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s calculations, based on data from the EBRD Transition Report series (1994-2010) and WB/WDI. <lb/>In addition to declining output levels and increasing private sector activity, several other <lb/>outcomes were observed across the transition region. Price liberalisation and the opening of markets to <lb/>external trade resulted in hyperinflation and substantial shifts in relative productivity levels across <lb/>sectors, rendering many existing activities unprofitable. The abolition of subsidies to agriculture and <lb/>industry (energy, fertiliser and transport costs were often heavily subsidised) led to a rapid <lb/>transformation in the structural composition of output. Specifically, the share of agriculture shrank <lb/>from 18 percent of total output in 1989 to 10 percent in 1995, while the industrial sector declined from <lb/>49 percent of GDP in 1989 to 36 percent in 1995. To a certain extent, these sectoral shifts were offset <lb/>by growth in the services sector. 6 <lb/>Real export growth and inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) were central to the transition. <lb/>Here too, it is important to note the diverging trends across countries. Export growth was strongest in <lb/>CEE, driven by demand from industrial countries. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic attracted <lb/>the lion&apos;s share of FDI inflows, which were vital as a means to attract capital, modernise industrial <lb/>processes and support technological upgrading. On the other hand, growth in exports and FDI was <lb/>considerably weaker in the FSU, and mostly concentrated in countries with large natural resource <lb/>endowments such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (World Bank, 2002). <lb/>Average poverty rates also increased throughout the transition region in the 1990s, provoked by <lb/>the collapse in output and higher levels of unemployment and income inequality. However, much of <lb/>the rise in unemployment and inequality in CEE was productive in nature, driven by the liquidation <lb/>and restructuring of inefficient SOEs, and increased returns to education and entrepreneurship. <lb/>Furthermore, government transfers and redistribution mechanisms in the Czech Republic, Estonia, <lb/>Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic worked to counterbalance the trend. Conversely, sharp <lb/>increases in poverty and inequality in the FSU were perpetuated by corruption, rent-seeking and <lb/>regulatory capture. In addition, many households had to rely on subsistence agriculture in order to <lb/>6. <lb/>See Figures 12 and 13 in Appendix A for a view on the changing composition of output in CEE and <lb/>the FSU. <lb/>40% <lb/>45% <lb/>50% <lb/>55% <lb/>60% <lb/>65% <lb/>70% <lb/>75% <lb/>80% <lb/>Transition Economies <lb/>Central and Eastern Europe <lb/>Former Soviet Union <lb/></body>

These factors stunted the formation of <lb/>competitive markets and suppressed the development of high quality institutions, particularly in <lb/>countries such as Armenia, Tajikistan and Russia (World Bank, 2000). 7 <lb/>3. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TRANSITION STRATEGIES <lb/> &quot; Absent definitive theories, views on growth have been shaped by facts and changed by <lb/>experience. &quot; Such is the nature of our current understanding of the drivers and dynamics of economic <lb/>growth, as affirmed by the World Bank&apos;s 2005 report titled Economic Growth in the 1990s – Learning <lb/>from a decade of reform. Indeed, with the benefit of almost a quarter of a century of hindsight, a <lb/>number of important lessons can be drawn from the economic and political transition that took place <lb/>following the end of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union. <lb/>Variations in economic performance across the transition region have motivated a large range of <lb/>empirical and theoretical research. Typically, studies focus on the role of initial conditions and the <lb/>choice of policy reforms in explaining cross-country differences in economic growth rates (Falcetti, <lb/>Raiser and Sanfey, 2002). Attempts have also been made to identify optimal reform pathways and <lb/>derive conclusions relating to the ideal speed, sequence and design of transition policies and strategies. <lb/>This section reviews the existing body of literature and develops an understanding of the core <lb/>components in a successful transition strategy. <lb/>3.1 The role of initial conditions <lb/>Consensus dictates that initial conditions were of great consequence in determining the rate at <lb/>which incomes in transition economies converged with those prevailing in advanced countries. In spite <lb/>of their common ideological perspective, countries in CEE and the FSU differed across a wide range <lb/>of structural, economic, political and institutional characteristics. In the beginning of transition, <lb/>income per capita ranged between USD 1 400 (Albania) and USD 9 200 (Slovenia) in CEE, and USD <lb/>2 740 (Uzbekistan) and USD 7 720 (Russia) in the FSU. 8 Income differences were frequently <lb/>associated with variations in levels of industrialisation, urbanisation and trade dependence. Other <lb/>relevant factors include location (as countries in Central Europe were able to develop stronger trade <lb/>links with Western Europe), the availability of natural resources 9 , the history of prior reforms and the <lb/>level of institutional development (De Melo et al., 2001). <lb/>According to an empirical study conducted by the World Bank (2002), initial conditions were a <lb/>significant determinant of growth between 1990 and 1994, during the early years of the transition <lb/>7. <lb/>According to the World Bank (2000), Armenia, Tajikistan and Russia registered the highest increases <lb/>in inequality out of all transition economies. In 1996-99, inequality levels (measured by the Gini <lb/>coefficient) had reached nearly twice the levels recorded in 1987-90. <lb/>8. <lb/>Income per capita is based on GNP in 1989 US dollars, adjusted for purchasing power parity. <lb/>9. <lb/>Several energy-rich countries in the FSU, including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and <lb/>Turkmenistan, were able to use their natural resource wealth as a pretext for delayed progress in <lb/>structural reforms. This ultimately took led to the deterioration of their long-run growth potential. <lb/></body>

			<body>recession. Over time, however, the importance of initial conditions declined and was superseded by <lb/>the impact of progress in policy reform. Countries with a strong commitment to reform were able to <lb/>overcome their inherited disadvantages, sustain political support and secure higher rates of economic <lb/>growth in the long run. Others entered transition with propitious beginnings, and emerged with inferior <lb/>growth rates as a result of incoherent and partial reforms. <lb/>3.2 Key determinants of success in transition strategies <lb/>Broadly put, transition strategies can be distinguished by the speed of implementation, the <lb/>comprehensiveness of reforms, and the internal sequencing of the policy package. These three <lb/>concepts are assessed below. <lb/>A key bone of contention in the literature is the debate between the proponents of &quot; shock <lb/>therapy &quot; and those who support a &quot; gradualist &quot; approach to reform. 10 The arguments in favour of <lb/>gradualism are primarily based on political and financial constraints. For instance, Dewatripont and <lb/>Roland (1992) suggest that in the presence of political opposition to reforms, a move to improve <lb/>allocative efficiency (through the liquidation of SOEs) may entail significant financial costs (e.g. <lb/>compensation schemes for public-sector workers). In this situation a &quot; big bang &quot; approach to <lb/>restructuring is not guaranteed to improve overall welfare, particularly when the short-term financial <lb/>costs of compensation exceed the long-term gains arising from a more productive allocation of labour. <lb/>Partial reforms are therefore a preferred alternative, as they allow workers with the lowest opportunity <lb/>costs to exit inefficient industries first, thereby reducing the financial burden of compensation <lb/>schemes. This perspective is also reflected by Aghion and Blanchard (1994), who note that rapid <lb/>restructuring of SOEs may be undesirable due to opposition from state workers and the potential <lb/>indirect costs of high unemployment. <lb/>On the other hand, the advocates of shock therapy argue that high unemployment and a drop in <lb/>output are unavoidable consequences, and as such a piecemeal approach can only increase the costs of <lb/>transition. Countries often have a narrow window of opportunity in which to implement reforms (e.g. <lb/>at the beginning of transition). Failure to do so can result in a &quot; partial reform paradox &quot; , where the <lb/>government becomes susceptible to regulatory capture by oligarchs and other vested interests, leading <lb/>to a low equilibrium level of reform (World Bank, 2002). Moreover, Sachs and Woo (1994) contend <lb/>that shock therapy was unavoidable in transition economies, owing to the large distortions created by <lb/>over-industrialisation, inefficient subsidies, excessive social spending and poor macroeconomic <lb/>management. They compare China&apos;s experience with gradualist reforms in the 1980s to the shock <lb/>treatment conducted in CEE and the FSU, and conclude that gradualism was successful in China due <lb/>to the large productivity differential between the inefficient agricultural sector and the new industrial <lb/>sector. In contrast, rapid enterprise restructuring in the transition region was necessary to free up <lb/>resources for the newly emerging private sector, but the relative opportunity cost for state workers <lb/>exiting heavily subsidised industries was substantially higher. <lb/>Comparing countries&apos; experiences in practice provides a crucial acid test for both sides of the <lb/>debate. Many of the successful countries in CEE undertook radical liberalisation in the early 1990s, <lb/>including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Albania, Estonia and Latvia. On the other hand, both <lb/>Hungary and Slovenia implemented reforms in a slower and more co-ordinated manner, and were also <lb/>able to achieve similarly high levels of growth. Other countries began with a radical liberalisation <lb/>programme but were unable to maintain momentum in reform implementation, and went on to achieve <lb/>growth with varying degrees of success (e.g. Bulgaria, Lithuania, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, <lb/>10. <lb/> &quot; Shock therapy &quot; is invariably referred to in the literature as a &quot; big bang &quot; approach to reform. The <lb/>terms &quot; gradualist &quot; and &quot; piecemeal &quot; are also used interchangeably in the context of reform strategies. <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>Romania and Russia). In reality, the debate of shock therapy versus gradualism may have been <lb/>inconsequential, as many of the countries that tried shock therapy only did so in response to a severe <lb/>crisis. <lb/>A further issue in the literature on transition strategies relates to sequencing, or the order in which <lb/>reforms are implemented. Dabrowski (1996) outlines three strategic guidelines on the ideal <lb/>progression of structural reforms during transition. <lb/>First, radical and comprehensive reforms to the macroeconomic environment are necessary at the <lb/>very beginning of transition. In the early 1990s, price controls, subsidies and other distortions had <lb/>created a large monetary overhang and suppressed inflation in most transition economies. Given that <lb/>domestic and external liberalisation would inevitably result in corrective inflation, strong monetary <lb/>and fiscal discipline was essential to rein in inflationary expectations and prevent prices from <lb/>spiralling out of control. <lb/>Second, price liberalisation is indispensable to allow for the efficient reallocation of resources, <lb/>and should also be undertaken early in the transition process. Prices are a fulcrum for the development <lb/>of market-based incentives, and their liberalisation facilitates the implementation of many other <lb/>structural reforms, including fiscal stabilisation, privatisation and competition policy. Conversely, <lb/>attempts to reduce the prevalence of monopolies and encourage private sector development are likely <lb/>to be ineffective if prices have not been deregulated. Reforms to trade and the foreign exchange <lb/>system should also take place after price liberalisation, as the adjustment of the domestic economy to <lb/>international prices is a vital means to stimulate competitiveness in external markets. <lb/>Third, Dabrowski (1996) postulates that privatisation and enterprise restructuring should only <lb/>proceed after significant advances have been made in the areas of stabilisation and liberalisation. In <lb/>Russia, rapid privatisation took place while progress in the areas of macroeconomic stabilisation, <lb/>competition policy and external liberalisation languished. This created incentives for rent-seeking and <lb/>profiteering in the private sector, at the expense of market-based competition. <lb/>Using the existing literature on transition strategies as a basis, one can conclude that <lb/>comprehensiveness, or progress in overall reform implementation, appears to be undeniably associated <lb/>with higher growth. However, the question of the ideal speed and sequencing of implementation <lb/>remains inconclusive. Not all fast-reforming countries have been rewarded equally with growth, and <lb/>several slow reformers have managed to achieve high growth rates against all odds. Moreover, <lb/>countries exhibit strong heterogeneity in initial conditions, and as such there is no unique optimal <lb/>sequence for transition. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. REFORM COMPLEMENTARITIES: THE &quot; MISSING LINK &quot; IN TRANSITION <lb/>STRATEGIES? <lb/>Transition is a complex and multifaceted process, and there is much contention on the principles <lb/>underlying the design of a successful policy package. Many of the conflicting ideologies that have <lb/>emerged in the literature were reviewed in section 3. This section seeks to exploit these ideas, and <lb/>advance the notion that reform complementarities are a key ingredient that has often been overlooked <lb/>in the analysis of transition strategies. In addition, composite indicators measuring the overall level of <lb/>reform implementation and the complementarity across reforms are developed and used to compare <lb/>trajectories of structural and institutional change in transition economies. <lb/>4.1 Exploring complementarities in the transition process <lb/>This paper does not advocate for the superiority of a particular speed or sequence of reforms as <lb/>such (although a comprehensive reform package is presumed to be unequivocally good for growth). <lb/>Rather, a successful transition strategy should focus on alleviating the &quot; binding constraints &quot; to growth, <lb/>and thus the preferred speed and sequence of reforms will naturally vary across countries and settings <lb/>(Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco, 2005). This perspective is confirmed by Staehr (2005), who <lb/>undertakes a principal component analysis to test for the effect of the speed and sequencing of reforms <lb/>on output performance in transition economies. The findings indicate that while comprehensive, <lb/>broad-based reforms have a strong impact on growth, the speed of implementation has no significant <lb/>influence. Furthermore, the results are unable to identify a single optimal sequence for transition <lb/>(although some particular arrangements of reforms are found to be positively associated with growth). <lb/>More fundamentally, the debate over the optimal speed and sequencing of transition policies <lb/>seems to have neglected a crucial point: the existence of complementary relationships between <lb/>reforms. Take the conflicting perspectives of shock therapy and gradualism, for instance. The <lb/>proponents of shock therapy (Sachs and Woo, 1994) argue that a rapid approach to enterprise <lb/>restructuring is needed to mobilise inefficient resources, while the advocates of gradualist theory <lb/>(Dewatripont and Roland, 1992; Aghion and Blanchard, 1994) contend that excessive political and <lb/>financial costs justify a slow and measured pace to implementation. In reality, both perspectives are <lb/>correct. The liquidation and restructuring of inefficient SOEs will necessarily free up resources and <lb/>entail costs, regardless of the speed of reform. However, these policies are condemned to fail if they <lb/>are not adequately complemented with measures to stimulate returns to entrepreneurship and private <lb/>sector activity. Creating a competitive business climate allows new firms to absorb the assets and <lb/>labour of old enterprises, overcome the initial loss of output from restructuring, and sustain growth in <lb/>the medium to long term (World Bank, 2002). The choice of speed should depend on practical issues, <lb/>such as political feasibility and the ability of individuals and firms to adjust to the new environment <lb/>and respond to incentives for wealth creation. <lb/>Reform complementarities have also been somewhat overlooked in the literature on sequencing. <lb/>For example, Dabrowski (1996) uses Russia&apos;s experience with mass-privatisation in the early 1990s to <lb/>justify the claim that macroeconomic stabilisation and price liberalisation must precede privatisation <lb/>reforms. However, this theory is at odds with the fact that privatisation has a direct impact on the <lb/>sustainability of macroeconomic reforms. The Bulgarian experience is symbolic in this respect: the <lb/>government introduced a comprehensive stabilisation and liberalisation package in 1991; however <lb/>progress in large-scale privatisation was slow. By the end of 1994, the government (including the <lb/>national Privatisation Agency) had only supervised 185 privatisation transactions out of a total of <lb/>3,500 (World Bank, 1995). This led to rent-seeking, asset stripping and significant pressure on the <lb/></body>

			<body>state budget. Thus the more fitting conclusion to draw is one that emphasises the strong <lb/>complementarities between stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Private ownership creates <lb/>incentives for the pursuit of profits, through efficient resource allocation and higher productivity <lb/>levels. The elimination of subsidies and price controls encourages firms to devote their efforts to <lb/>relevant activities that add value to the economy. And macroeconomic stabilisation supports consumer <lb/>and producer confidence by reducing inflationary expectations, preventing hyperinflation and <lb/>providing a stable investment climate. The strong complementarities between these policies imply that <lb/>inattention to one particular area can lead to unintended and catastrophic consequences such as weak <lb/>incentives, inefficient resource allocation and rapidly accelerating inflation. <lb/>The presence of reform complementarities has two important implications: First, the returns to <lb/>reform implementation are amplified by the implementation of other complementary reforms. And <lb/>second, neglecting to undertake complementary reforms can substantially diminish the returns to an <lb/>existing reform. This second corollary is strikingly reminiscent of the theory of the second-best, which <lb/>affirms that in the presence of numerous distortions, the welfare effects of the removal of any one <lb/>distortion are ambiguous, and may be either positive, negative or neutral (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). <lb/>In the context of transition strategies, the relevant conclusion to be drawn is that countries should <lb/>develop an approach based on maximising complementarity across reforms. This is essentially <lb/>consistent with Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) who recommend targeting the &quot; binding <lb/>constraints &quot; to growth, as these areas are expected to have a strong positive impact on welfare. By <lb/>prioritising reforms that have strong complementary relationships with the existing policy framework, <lb/>countries can avoid negative second-best effects and focus on the policies that are most likely to be <lb/>welfare enhancing. <lb/>4.2 Measuring reform complementarities and progress in transition <lb/>Having established a theoretical framework for complementarity, the remainder of this section <lb/>turns to questions of measurement by developing a methodology to quantify reform complementarities <lb/>in the context of transition. As a necessary first step, a formal definition for complementarity is <lb/>adopted, based on Topkis (1978) and Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins (2008). <lb/>Suppose an objective function í µí±(•) depends on two reform areas (í µí±¥, í µí±¦). Each area has two <lb/>possible values: reform (í µí±¥ í µí±í µí± í µí±¦) or no reform (í µí±¥′ í µí±í µí± í µí±¦′). Hence the two reforms are said to be <lb/>complementary if the following condition is met: <lb/>í µí±(í µí±¥, í µí±¦ ′ ) − í µí±(í µí±¥ ′ , í µí±¦ ′ ) ≤ í µí±(í µí±¥, í µí±¦) − í µí±(í µí±¥ ′ , í µí±¦) <lb/>(1) <lb/>This means that the return to implementing reform í µí±¥ is greater when reform í µí±¦ has already been <lb/>implemented, and vice-versa. It is worth noting that this condition holds when í µí±(í µí±¥, í µí±¦) is <lb/>monotonically increasing in í µí±¥ and í µí±¦ (i.e. <lb/>í µí¼ 2 í µí±(í µí±¥,í µí±¦) <lb/>í µí¼í µí±¥í µí¼í µí±¦ <lb/>≥ 0 ). <lb/>Extending the concept of complementarity to a set of í µí± reforms, í µí±(•) is &quot; supermodular &quot; if <lb/>complementary relationships exist for each and every pair of policies (Topkis, 1998; Braga de Macedo <lb/>and Oliveira Martins, 2008). This implies that complementarities exist throughout the entire policy <lb/>package, and the adoption of any one subset of complementary reforms will increase the incremental <lb/>returns to implementing the remaining set of reforms (Gates, Milgrom and Roberts, 1994). Section 4.1 <lb/>identified several plausible examples of complementary relationships between reforms. To illustrate <lb/>that linkages and synergies exist across the entire policy framework, a summary of pair-wise <lb/>complementarities for ten major areas of structural reform is provided in Table 1 in Appendix A. In <lb/>practice, policy linkages will not be uniform and equal in magnitude. Nevertheless, the assumption of <lb/></body>

			<body>supermodularity (all reforms are complementary, but some reforms are more complementary than <lb/>others) is crucial as it allows for the construction of a composite indicator to measure the level of <lb/>complementarity across reforms. <lb/>This paper uses the EBRD Transition Indicators to measure progress in transition for 30 <lb/>countries, from 1989 to 2012. The full list of countries covered is provided in Table 4 in Appendix B, <lb/>and includes all of the CEE and FSU countries, as well as Turkey and Mongolia. 11 The indicators <lb/>cover nine major areas of structural reform: large-scale privatisation, small-scale privatisation, <lb/>governance and enterprise restructuring, price liberalisation, trade and the foreign exchange system, <lb/>competition policy, banking reform and interest rate liberalisation, securities markets and non-bank <lb/>financial institutions, and infrastructure. The scores for each indicator vary between 1 (no progress in <lb/>reform) and 4.33 (full reform, comparable with advanced economies), and are reported on an annual <lb/>basis in the EBRD Transition Report. A detailed description of the EBRD Transition Indicators is <lb/>provided in Table 5 in Appendix B, along with the other data sources used in this paper. <lb/>The EBRD Transition Indicators form the basis for the design of two composite indicators, <lb/>which are used to measure overall progress in transition (reform level), and capture changes in the <lb/>distribution of individual reform indicators (reform complementarity). Following Braga de Macedo, <lb/>Oliveira Martins and Rocha (2010), the reform level (RL) is measured as the simple average of the <lb/>nine areas of structural reform, and reform complementarity (RC) is calculated by taking the standard <lb/>deviation of the nine indicators. When the scores for the individual reform indicators are equal, the <lb/>standard deviation is zero and reform complementarities are at their highest. <lb/>Complementarity measures the level of dispersion across the existing policy framework, and is <lb/>therefore independent of the overall level of reform. In the beginning of transition, the policy <lb/>environment in most countries was both highly distorted and highly complementary. Price controls, <lb/>subsidies, an oversized state sector, a repressed private sector and strict controls on trade and foreign <lb/>exchange all formed part of a self-sustaining (albeit highly precarious) system. In this context, a radial <lb/>reform strategy involving a simultaneous reduction of all distortions is the most desirable approach, as <lb/>it ensures that complementarity levels are maintained at a maximum throughout the transition process. <lb/>However, this method is typically unfeasible due to informational and institutional limitations, and <lb/>governments often had to allow complementarity to decrease as they implemented reforms in <lb/>succession. <lb/>The transition to a market economy was often a bumpy ride, as a fall in complementarity would <lb/>necessarily entail the exposure of an economy to negative second-best effects. This result is clearly <lb/>visible in Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate the structural evolution of transition for a selected set of <lb/>economies in CEE and the FSU (the remaining country graphs are presented in Figures 14 and 15 in <lb/>Appendix A). <lb/>The large variability in policy packages and growth performance across countries provides a <lb/>useful platform for the investigation of complementarities among various reforms. Successful <lb/>countries were able to capitalise on the linkages and interdependencies between reforms and generate <lb/>concurrent increases in RL and RC. The U-shaped transition is clearly visible in many of the <lb/>successful CEE countries, including Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. In stark contrast, a <lb/>number of the FSU countries appear to be stuck in a low equilibrium reform trap, including Belarus, <lb/>Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Reforms also appear to have slowed or backtracked in the energy <lb/>exporting economies of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia. The findings are provocative, and suggest <lb/>that more attention ought to be given to reform complementarities in empirical studies on growth in <lb/>transition economies. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. EMPIRICAL TESTS: DO COMPLEMENTARITIES MATTER FOR GROWTH? <lb/>Over the past two decades, an abundant literature has emerged using cross-country empirical <lb/>analysis to quantify the importance of reforms in the transition process. Studies have invariably tested <lb/>for the weight of initial conditions and structural reforms in determining economic growth rates. At the <lb/>same time, numerous criticisms of aggregate cross country growth regressions have been raised. <lb/>Typically, concerns relate to the arbitrary choice of policy variables, the omission of variables <lb/>capturing differences in institutional quality, the assumptions underlying growth models and the <lb/>inability of reform indicators to predict changes in economic performance (World Bank, 2005). The <lb/>quality of GDP and inflation data has also been called into question, due to systematic over-reporting <lb/>of output during the pre-transition period, under-reporting of growth in the early years of transition <lb/>and the inability to account for a marked increase in informal sector activity (Campos and Coricelli, <lb/>2002). 12 <lb/>Notwithstanding these important caveats, this section attempts to capture the impact of reforms <lb/>and complementarity on growth in transition economies. Figures 5 and 6 provide an initial view of the <lb/>data for the period 1989 to 1996. A U-shaped relationship is clearly observable between í µí±í µí°¿ and <lb/>í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ in Figure 5, confirming the hypothesis that initial policy improvements in the early <lb/>stages of transition led to reduced welfare, but further commitment to reform thereafter was positively <lb/>associated with growth. A positive relationship can also be seen in the relationship between <lb/>í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ and changes in complementarity (Figure 6), providing strong support for the inclusion <lb/>of this variable in the empirical model. <lb/>12. <lb/>Estimates of the share of the informal economy during transition range between 6 and 60 percent <lb/>(World Bank, 2002). <lb/></body>

The econometric tests are conducted with an unbalanced panel covering 30 countries and <lb/>24 years (1989 to 2012). 13 The results of the panel regressions are reported in Table 1, and are broadly <lb/>consistent with the results reported in Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins (2008). Several models <lb/>are tested, including one-way fixed effects, GLS random effects and a two-way fixed effects model <lb/>with time dummies.

Their removal has no noticeable <lb/>impact on the results. <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>Three important methodological differences are worth noting at this point. First, and foremost, the <lb/>measure of reform complementarity adopted here is the standard deviation (and not the inverse of the <lb/>Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is used in Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins, 2008). <lb/>The standard deviation is preferred as it produced more favourable results in the estimations, and <lb/>responds to incremental changes in reform indicators in a consistent manner. 14 Second, the inflation <lb/>variable is calculated using the logarithmic transformation log (100 + í µí°¼í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±), which allows for <lb/>some smoothing of the hyperinflation episodes that took place during the early 1990s (Staehr, 2005). <lb/>This increases the explanatory power of the model and results in a substantially higher magnitude for <lb/>the estimated coefficient of the inflation variable. 15 And third, initial conditions are measured as the <lb/>log of 1989 GDP per capita (in constant 2005 US dollars). This variable could only be included in the <lb/>GLS random effects model, as the fixed effects model does not allow for the inclusion of time-<lb/>invariant variables. <lb/>Curiously, an improvement in initial conditions appears to have a negative influence on GDP <lb/>growth. One possible explanation is that many of the countries that entered the transition with poor <lb/>initial conditions in the early 1990s have sustained unusually high growth rates in recent years as a <lb/>result of natural resource exports. Indeed, the bottom ten countries in terms of 1989 GDP per capita <lb/>include Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. Starting from a lower base also meant <lb/>that these countries were able to achieve rapid growth as income levels in the FSU recovered from the <lb/>transition recession. <lb/>The results also indicate that a higher overall level of reform (í µí±í µí°¿) is associated with higher <lb/>growth, confirming the importance of sustaining momentum in reforms. However, the coefficient on <lb/>the change in reform level (Δí µí±í µí°¿) variable is negative. This reflects the theory of the second-best: <lb/>governments are often unable to implement broad-based reforms and must resort to a piecemeal <lb/>approach, which typically causes welfare losses in the short-run. <lb/>On the other hand, the reform complementarity (−í µí±í µí° ¶) variable has a negative coefficient. This <lb/>means that high levels of complementarity (which occur when the standard deviation is low) are <lb/>associated with negative movements in output. The result should not come as a surprise, as many <lb/>unreformed and distorted economies exhibited high levels of complementarity during the early stages <lb/>of transition. The more interesting result in the context of this paper is the change in reform <lb/>complementarity (−Δí µí±í µí° ¶) variable, which displays a positive coefficient. Hence an increase in <lb/>complementarity (which corresponds to a decrease in the standard deviation) generates a positive <lb/>output response. This confirms the hypothesis that increases in reform complementarity have a <lb/>positive effect on growth. <lb/>In spite of the difficulties associated with defining meaningful policy indicators that effectively <lb/>capture the impact of economic and institutional reforms, the results of the initial empirical tests are <lb/>encouraging. The fixed and random effects models explain approximately 50 percent of the time-<lb/>variant effects of policy reforms on output. Both the average level of reform and changes in reform <lb/>complementarity are positively associated with growth, suggesting that countries should prioritise <lb/>reforms that have a positive impact on complementarity, while aspiring to a high overall level of <lb/>reform in the long run. <lb/>14. <lb/>See Appendix C for a detailed explanation of why the standard deviation is preferred over the inverse <lb/>of the HHI. <lb/>15. <lb/>Testing for inflation (without the logarithmic transformation) resulted in a coefficient of -0.0044 for <lb/>the first two models in Table 1. It also led to a substantially lower R-squared coefficient: 0.44 in the <lb/>fixed effects model and 0.46 in the random effects model. <lb/></body>

			<body>Having established the robustness of the estimations reported in Table 1, a second set of <lb/>empirical tests were conducted to control for other relevant determinants of growth. The econometric <lb/>specification is therefore extended as follows: <lb/>í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ = í µí»¼ + í µí»½ 1 ln(100 + í µí°¼í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±) + í µí»½ 2 í µí±í µí°¿ + í µí»½ 3 ∆í µí±í µí°¿ − í µí»½ 4 (−í µí±í µí° ¶) − í µí»½ 5 (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) <lb/>− í µí»½ 6 [−∆í µí±í µí° ¶(−1)] − í µí»½ 7 [−∆í µí±í µí° ¶(−2)] + �(í µí»¾ í µí± Ζ í µí± ) <lb/>í µí± <lb/>+ í µí¼ <lb/>(3) <lb/>Equation (3) seeks to substantiate two important hypotheses. First, the model suggests that a <lb/>change in the reform complementarity indicator has an impact on growth over time, beyond the <lb/>contemporaneous effect that has already been tested. This assumption is embodied in the two lagged <lb/>terms Δí µí±í µí° ¶(−1) and Δí µí±í µí° ¶(−2). Second, the specification seeks to test for the impact of a series of <lb/>control variables, represented by the summation term ∑ (í µí»¾ í µí± Ζ í µí± ) <lb/>í µí± <lb/>. Data for the control variables are <lb/>obtained from the World Bank&apos;s World Development Indicators. <lb/>Table 2 compares the results of five panel estimations. The initial conditions variable is excluded, <lb/>because the models are an extension of the one-way fixed effects regression reported in the first <lb/>column of Table 1 (the random effects model was rejected by the Hausman test). In order to test for <lb/>the robustness of the estimated coefficients, columns 3, 4 and 5 experiment with various alternative <lb/>combinations of the explanatory variables. A comparison reveals that the coefficients are relatively <lb/>stable and the results do not lose significance when explanatory variables are removed from the model. <lb/>The first point worth noting is that the augmented model does not substantially alter the sign, <lb/>magnitude or statistical significance of the initial set of variables. A high reform level (í µí±í µí°¿) and an <lb/>increase in reform complementarity (–Δí µí±í µí° ¶) are still positively correlated with growth, and all of the <lb/>original explanatory variables remain significant at either 1 or 5 percent. <lb/>Second, the lagged coefficients of (−Δí µí±í µí° ¶) are also statistically significant, confirming the <lb/>assumption that an improvement in complementarity influences growth beyond the short-term <lb/>contemporaneous effect. 16 Moreover, the effects over time are non-trivial: in the first two estimations <lb/>(models (1) and (2) in Table 2), the combined magnitude of the lagged coefficients of (−Δí µí±í µí° ¶) <lb/>exceeds the coefficient for the contemporaneous impact. <lb/>Turning to the estimated coefficients for the control variables, a number of interesting findings <lb/>emerge. Increases in government expenditure are negatively associated with growth, suggesting that <lb/>transition economies are overburdened by bureaucracy and public sector inefficiencies. Conversely, an <lb/>increase in FDI inflows leads to higher growth. Attracting FDI has been the hallmark of successful <lb/>transition economies in recent years, and could be an important policy focus for countries seeking to <lb/>increase their orientation to external markets. <lb/>The inclusion of the secondary school enrolment variable is motivated by the fact that growth <lb/>regressions for transition economies often neglect to incorporate measures of human capital <lb/>accumulation (Staehr, 2005). As expected, the results demonstrate that higher levels of human capital <lb/>lead to higher growth. Oil rents are also positively correlated with growth, reflecting the substantial <lb/>growth stimulus that has occurred over the past decade as a result of increased oil production in <lb/>countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia. <lb/>16. <lb/>Changes in the average reform level (∆RL) also impact growth (negatively) over time, however due to <lb/>multicollinearity the ∆RL(-1) and ∆RC(-1) variables lose significance when included in the model <lb/>together. <lb/></body>

			<body>Curiously, a higher degree of urbanisation seems to reduce growth. This may be due to the <lb/>importance of rural and regional economic systems in contributing to the growth process in transition <lb/>economies. Alternatively, it could be a reflection of natural resource abundance in countries with large <lb/>territories and low levels of urbanisation. <lb/>Finally, the structure of output also has a substantial influence on growth. An increase in the <lb/>share of agriculture and industry in GDP engenders a positive growth response, and an increase in the <lb/>share of services in GDP is negatively associated with growth. This result should not be immediately <lb/>interpreted as a justification for greater industrialisation and the development of agriculture in <lb/>transition economies, as it mostly reflects the large transformation in the structure of output <lb/>experienced during the transition recession. 17 <lb/>17. <lb/>See Section 2 and Figures 12 and 13 in Appendix A for further details on the changing composition of <lb/>output in CEE and the FSU. <lb/></body>

			<body>6. POLICY COMPLEMENTARITIES IN PRACTICE: THE CASE OF KAZAKHSTAN <lb/>As the wealthiest and second-most populous country in Central Asia, Kazakhstan provides an <lb/>interesting case study for the theory of reform complementarities. The economy sustained a sharp <lb/>output decline during the early years of transition, and did not regain its 1989 level of real GDP per <lb/>capita until 2003. An aggressive stance on internal and external liberalisation may have initially <lb/>exacerbated the effects of the recession; however the reforms eventually precipitated substantial FDI <lb/>inflows in the extractive industries. The country has enjoyed high growth rates and rising prosperity <lb/>over the past decade, primarily driven by the production of mineral and fossil fuel resources. <lb/>In spite of this progress, income per capita growth has been highly volatile, and the economy <lb/>remains considerably exposed to external shocks. Figure 7 depicts sharp fluctuations in Kazakhstan&apos;s <lb/>GDP per capita growth rate, which closely follows growth rates in the FSU. In particular, the country <lb/>was severely affected by the 1998 Russian crisis, a local banking crisis in 2008, and the 2009 global <lb/>economic downturn. Recent efforts to stabilise the economy have provided some relief, however <lb/>banking sector weaknesses persist and commodity price instability continues to generate strong <lb/>inflationary pressures (IMF, 2012). <lb/>Figure 7. Real GDP per capita growth in Kazakhstan, 1989-2012 <lb/>Note: Regional aggregates are population-weighted. <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s calculations, based on data from WB/WDI. <lb/>Similar to other countries in the FSU, the transition recession led to a marked shift in the <lb/>structural composition of output in Kazakhstan. Figure 16 in Appendix A illustrates the sharp decline <lb/>in the share of agriculture and industry in GDP, which fell from a combined level of 71 percent in <lb/>1992 (27 percent for agriculture and 45 percent for industry) to 43 percent in 2012 (4 percent for <lb/>agriculture and 39 percent for industry). To a certain extent, the depth of Kazakhstan&apos;s output collapse <lb/>at the beginning of transition can be attributed to relatively higher levels of initial industrialisation and <lb/>a strong exposure to competitive pressures from the Russian market. <lb/>-15 <lb/>-10 <lb/>-5 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>GDP growth (annual %) <lb/>Kazakhstan <lb/>Former Soviet Union <lb/></body>

			<body>Kazakhstan&apos;s transition was marked by radical reforms in the early 1990s, particularly in the <lb/>areas of price liberalisation, small-scale privatisation, trade openness and the foreign exchange system. <lb/>As the last country to formally declare independence from the Soviet Union, economic and social ties <lb/>with Russia had a strong influence on the choice of policy reforms in Kazakhstan (Hoen and <lb/>Irnazarov, 2012). For instance, the liberalisation of domestic prices in January 1992 took place in <lb/>parallel to the removal of price controls in Russia. By the end of 1994, full price liberalisation was <lb/>virtually complete, with more than 90 percent of prices free of administrative controls (EBRD, 1994). <lb/>The privatisation process was also strongly influenced by Russian reforms, with the adoption of a <lb/>voucher-based programme in 1994. By 1996, 60 percent of the 1,700 enterprises designated for large-<lb/>scale privatisation and 70 percent of the 16,000 entities earmarked for small-scale privatisation had <lb/>been transferred into private ownership (EBRD, 1996). <lb/>Complementarities were central to the transition process in Kazakhstan, particularly between <lb/>liberalisation and privatisation reforms. Privatisation improved the incentives for profit generation, <lb/>and the removal of price controls and subsidies ensured that resources were allocated more efficiently <lb/>within the economy. Privatisation also facilitated the process of macroeconomic stabilisation. Driven <lb/>by the sale of large oil concessions in the late 1990s, Kazakhstan&apos;s privatisation proceeds as a share of <lb/>GDP were the highest out of all transition economies. This additional source of budgetary revenue <lb/>substantially improved the fiscal adjustment process in Kazakhstan. An aggressive monetary stance <lb/>also helped to reduce inflation to manageable levels, creating favourable conditions for investment and <lb/>private sector activity (Alam and Banerji, 2000). <lb/>Kazakhstan also implemented significant reforms to liberalise trade and the foreign exchange <lb/>system. A convertible national currency with a single unified exchange rate was introduced in <lb/>November 1993, and most export and import quotas and licensing requirements were abolished by <lb/>1995 (EBRD, 1996). These reforms have been instrumental in encouraging domestic firms to increase <lb/>productivity in the face of strong competitive pressures from international markets. More recently, the <lb/>establishment of a Customs Union between Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia in January 2010 has <lb/>further increased Kazakhstan&apos;s exposure to foreign competition, particularly the Russian market (IMF, <lb/>2011). <lb/>Figure 8 depicts progress in the implementation of major structural reforms in Kazakhstan <lb/>between 1995 and 2012. While &quot; shock therapy &quot; has led to extensive improvements in the domains of <lb/>privatisation, price liberalisation and trade policy, several crucial areas remain only partially reformed. <lb/>In particular, competition policy and governance and enterprise restructuring only score 2 out of a <lb/>maximum possible score of 4.33. These areas have remained largely unreformed for the past two <lb/>decades. <lb/></body>

See Table 5 in Appendix B for a detailed definition of the <lb/>EBRD Transition Indicators. <lb/>Source: EBRD Transition Report (1995; 2000; 2012) <lb/>Kazakhstan needs to confront two important challenges in order to sustain economic growth and <lb/>foster the development of a competitive private sector. First, the government should reduce state <lb/>interference in the economy by restructuring large and unprofitable enterprises, and strengthening the <lb/>corporate governance of SOEs. Second, the development of a competitive business environment is <lb/>crucial to encourage private sector development. Improving the legal and institutional framework for <lb/>competition policy can facilitate the entry of new enterprises and reduce the abuse of market power by <lb/>monopolies and conglomerates. <lb/>Enterprise restructuring is a central part of the transition process, as it reduces the economic <lb/>burden of inefficient industries and provides new firms with a valuable source of assets and labour. <lb/>Imposing market discipline on SOEs improves corporate governance, creates incentives for <lb/>restructuring and increases productivity. Conversely, weak corporate governance and inefficient <lb/>resource transfers to SOEs ultimately results in corruption, rent-seeking and the discouragement of <lb/>private sector activity. Kazakhstan has made limited progress in this area, with no significant reforms <lb/>to governance and enterprise restructuring since 1996. <lb/>Economic growth stems from the creation and growth of new enterprises, which are subject to a <lb/>level playing field and proper incentives for wealth creation. In this regard, an effective competition <lb/>policy is essential as it prevents large monopolies and conglomerates from restricting new entrants <lb/>from competing in the market. This provides new enterprises with the incentives to absorb the <lb/>resources of old firms, undertake new investments and sustain high growth and employment levels <lb/>(World Bank, 2002). Therefore, there is strong evidence of a symbiotic relationship between enterprise <lb/>restructuring and competition policy. Comprehensive reforms to both areas are likely to induce <lb/>significant benefits in terms of economic performance. <lb/>In addition, there are considerable complementarities between enterprise restructuring, <lb/>competition policy and trade liberalisation.

			<body>competition, and prevents incumbent SOEs from using their dominant position to interfere in markets. <lb/>However, competition policy in Kazakhstan has not improved since June 1994, when a new anti-<lb/>monopoly law was introduced (EBRD, 1995). Amendments to the legislation were introduced in June <lb/>2012 in an attempt to limit the prevalence of state monopolies, however in practice no concrete <lb/>progress has been made in reducing the role of the state in the economy (EBRD, 2012). This suggests <lb/>there are substantial benefits to be reaped from reforms to the complementary areas of governance and <lb/>enterprise restructuring, competition policy, and trade liberalisation. <lb/>The hypothesis that comprehensive reforms to enterprise restructuring, competition policy and <lb/>trade liberalisation will have a positive impact on economic growth in Kazakhstan can be tested by <lb/>means of a predictive scenario analysis. Figure 9 illustrates three potential reform scenarios for <lb/>Kazakhstan. The first case is a &quot; no reform &quot; scenario, with no changes to the current institutional <lb/>framework. The second case is a &quot; comprehensive reform &quot; scenario, involving the complete removal of <lb/>all distortions in the areas of governance and enterprise restructuring, competition policy and the trade <lb/>and foreign exchange system. This corresponds to an increase to 4.33 (the maximum possible score) <lb/>for the EBRD Transition Indicators in these respective areas. The third &quot; partial reform &quot; scenario <lb/>signifies a partial increase (from 2 to 3) in the score for the governance and enterprise restructuring <lb/>indicator. <lb/>Figure 9. Comparing potential reform scenarios for Kazakhstan <lb/>Note: Scores range between a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.33. See Table 5 in Appendix B for a detailed definition of the <lb/>EBRD Transition Indicators. <lb/>Figure 10 illustrates the results of the predictive scenario analysis, which calculates GDP growth <lb/>forecasts for Kazakhstan based on the coefficients estimated in regression model (1) in Table 2. The <lb/>results indicate that ceteris paribus, comprehensive reforms to enterprise restructuring, competition <lb/>policy and trade liberalisation will have a positive impact on GDP growth. The reforms initially induce <lb/>a negative second-best result; however this loss is compensated for by higher growth rates in <lb/>subsequent years. On the other hand, the partial reform scenario results in a strong negative impact on <lb/>output growth. This reflects the fact that partial reforms in transition economies have often left <lb/>countries mired in a low equilibrium level of reform. It seems that complementarities are of cardinal <lb/>significance in the quest for growth, and neglecting to take them into account can have dire <lb/>consequences for a country&apos;s welfare and prosperity. <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>Large-scale privatisation <lb/>Small-scale privatisation <lb/>Governance and enterprise <lb/>restructuring <lb/>Price liberalisation <lb/>Trade and foreign exchange system <lb/>Competition policy <lb/>Banking reform and interest rate <lb/>liberalisation <lb/>Securities markets and non-bank <lb/>financial institutions <lb/>Infrastructure <lb/>No reform <lb/>Comprehensive reform <lb/>Partial reform <lb/></body>

CONCLUSIONS <lb/>With over two decades of experience to reflect upon, it is remarkable that economists have yet to <lb/>reach a consensus on the elements needed to generate sustainable growth in the context of transition. <lb/>To be sure, differing initial conditions, economic shocks and a susceptibility to adverse second-best <lb/>outcomes have all served to obfuscate the relationship between policy reforms and growth <lb/>performance. Nevertheless, this paper attempts to derive a number of decisive lessons that can be used <lb/>to inform the design of transition strategies. <lb/>The central conclusion that emerges from this study is that countries in transition should aim to <lb/>maximise complementarity within the existing policy framework. Using complementarities as a basis <lb/>for the prioritisation of reforms is comparable to an approach based on targeting the &quot; binding <lb/>constraints &quot; to growth, and is the strategy most predisposed to be welfare enhancing. <lb/>To substantiate this theory, empirical tests are conducted for 30 transition economies over the <lb/>period 1989 to 2012, relating output growth to indicators of the level and complementarity of reforms. <lb/>Composite indicators are calculated using nine key measures of structural reform, taken from the <lb/>EBRD Transition Indicators database: large-scale privatisation, small-scale privatisation, governance <lb/>and enterprise restructuring, price liberalisation, trade and the foreign exchange system, competition <lb/>policy, banking reform and interest rate liberalisation, securities markets and non-bank financial <lb/>institutions, and infrastructure. 18 The reform level indicator is measured as the simple average of the <lb/>18. <lb/>See Table 5 in Appendix B for a detailed definition of the EBRD Transition Indicators. <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/>9 <lb/>10 <lb/>GDP growth (annual %) <lb/>GDP growth (historic) <lb/>No reform <lb/>Comprehensive reform <lb/>Partial reform <lb/></body>

			<body>individual areas of structural reform, and reform complementarity is calculated by taking the standard <lb/>deviation of the nine indicators. The panel data estimations demonstrate that the reform level (í µí±í µí°¿) and <lb/>change in reform complementarity (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) variables are both positively associated with GDP growth. <lb/>Furthermore, the results are robust to the addition of numerous control variables, including a measure <lb/>of initial conditions (proxied by the log of 1989 GDP per capita), macroeconomic stabilisation <lb/>(proxied by the log of inflation), and other indicators commonly incorporated in growth regressions <lb/>such as government expenditure, net FDI inflows and secondary school enrolment. <lb/>The estimation of lagged coefficients for the change in reform complementarity variable (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) <lb/>is a novel feature of the analysis presented in this paper. The results illustrate that a change in reform <lb/>complementarity has a significant influence on real GDP growth over time, highlighting the <lb/>importance of controlling for the dynamic impact of reforms in growth regressions. The use of the <lb/>regression model coefficients to generate growth forecasts is also a unique feature of this study. The <lb/>findings suggest that Kazakhstan should implement comprehensive reforms to a targeted group of <lb/>complementary policies in order to generate growth. A partial reform strategy, on the other hand, is <lb/>likely to have an unfavourable impact on welfare. <lb/>This research paper is by no means exhaustive and a number of potential avenues remain open for <lb/>further research. For instance, it is widely recognised that policies are endogenous to growth, and the <lb/>feasible set of policies in one time period may depend on the nature of previous policy decisions <lb/>(World Bank, 2002). Controlling for endogeneity is therefore essential to correct for the possibility of <lb/>bias in the panel estimations. Another possible area to be explored is the calculation process for the <lb/>composite indicators of reform level and reform complementarity, which implicitly consider all <lb/>policies to be of equal importance and influence to the growth process. This assumption can be relaxed <lb/>through the introduction of a weighting scheme for the individual reform indicators. <lb/>Finally, this paper has focused on a specific package of structural reforms, leaving a number of <lb/>important institutional reforms absent from the analysis. Rodrik (2005) argues that high-quality <lb/>institutional arrangements are central to the transition process, as they imbue an economy with the <lb/>resilience to withstand economic shocks and the ability to boost &quot; productive dynamism &quot; . Sustaining <lb/>growth in the long-term therefore requires sound and sophisticated institutions. Further research can <lb/>include measures of more complex institutional changes, such as reforms to the legal framework, <lb/>judicial system and tax administration. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">APPENDIX C: COMPARING MEASURES OF REFORM COMPLEMENTARITY <lb/>Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins (2008) were the first to propose using the inverse of the <lb/>Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) as a measure of reform complementarity. However, in a <lb/>subsequent paper, Braga de Macedo, Oliveira Martins and Rocha (2010) measure complementarities <lb/>(or &quot; policy dispersion &quot; ) using the standard deviation instead. <lb/>This paper advocates the use of the standard deviation as a measure of complementarity, as it is <lb/>more consistent in representing changes in the distribution of individual reform indicators. This can be <lb/>illustrated by means of a simple example: suppose an economic system can be characterised by three <lb/>reform indicators (e.g. stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation), and that each indicator is <lb/>allocated a score from 1 to 4. Table 6 outlines five different scenarios, each corresponding to different <lb/>levels in the individual reform indicators. <lb/>According to Table 6, the standard deviation considers the level of complementarity to be equal <lb/>in scenarios 2 and 4. Therefore, a move from (1,1,1) to (1,2,1) is considered to have the same impact <lb/>on complementarity as a move from (2,2,2) to (2,3,2). On the other hand, the inverse of the HHI <lb/>computes equal levels of complementarity for scenarios 2 and 5. Hence a move from (1,1,1) to (1,2,1) <lb/>is interpreted as equivalent (in terms of the change in the complementarity index) to a move from <lb/>(2,2,2) to (2,4,2). It seems the standard deviation is a more realistic choice, as it interprets reform <lb/>indicators in the way they are intended: a linear shift in a country&apos;s score from 1 to 2 is roughly <lb/>equivalent to a move from 2 to 3. <lb/>Table 6.
