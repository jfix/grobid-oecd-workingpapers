			<body>KEY MESSAGES <lb/>• People disadvantaged in the labour market or underrepresented in the entrepreneurial population are disproportionally <lb/>impacted by difficulties in access to finance for business start-ups. Low-educated and young people, in particular, are <lb/>more likely to mention financing problems as a major constraint to starting a business. Women and young entrepreneurs <lb/>rely more on the support of family, friends and public authorities. The low educated, on the other hand, are less likely <lb/>to receive public financing.<lb/>• Traditional financing mechanisms such as grants and subsidised loans have supported in the past the self-employment <lb/>of disadvantaged groups. However, given the current constraints to government budgets, they are expensive policy solu-<lb/>tions. New emerging financing instruments can complement the role of traditional policies, including loan guarantees, <lb/>microcredit, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending and business angel investment. It is important that policy makers introduce <lb/>appropriate policy actions to extend the reach of these mechanisms.<lb/>• Loan guarantees have mainly been used so far by traditional small firms, but they can also play a role in supporting <lb/>inclusive entrepreneurship. Targeted microcredit programmes are warranted to make microcredit more socially inclusive, <lb/>as there are signs that microcredit in the EU might not be serving adequately the needs of traditional clients such as <lb/>women and migrants. Awareness should be raised and appropriate regulations introduced to support Internet-based <lb/>mechanisms such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. Business angel investment, while traditionally associated <lb/>with high-impact entrepreneurship, can also positively affect the development of inclusive entrepreneurship, provided <lb/>that appropriate adjustments are adopted.<lb/>• Barriers to access to finance are not only of market nature. Supply-side interventions should be integrated by others <lb/>aimed at upgrading the skills of disadvantaged entrepreneurs, including financial education. Financial education must be <lb/>practice-oriented and is most likely to have an impact if its provision is integrated with the supply of finance.<lb/>INTRODUCTION <lb/>More than one-third of the European Union&apos;s adult population <lb/>would rather be self-employed than an employee if given the <lb/>chance to choose, according to the 2012 Flash Eurobarometer <lb/>survey. At the same time, there is a large entrepreneurial poten-<lb/>tial in social groups that are either disadvantaged in the labour <lb/>market (e.g. youth, migrants, and the low-skilled) or under-<lb/>represented in the entrepreneurial population (e.g. women and <lb/>seniors). Inclusive entrepreneurship policies aim to give the <lb/>opportunity for people from these groups to start-up in busi-<lb/>ness and self-employment both for economic reasons and to <lb/>support the goal of social inclusion. <lb/>One of the critical areas for policy action involves improving access <lb/>to finance. Lack of finance is a common barrier for most new <lb/>enterprises, which is magnified among the most disadvantaged <lb/>and under-represented groups (with the exception of senior entre-<lb/>preneurs), reflecting in large part the relative lack of collateral <lb/>assets and own financial resources in these groups. Some of these <lb/>groups may additionally face social discrimination in credit mar-<lb/>kets. Policies and programmes that favour access to finance for <lb/>disadvantaged or underrepresented entrepreneurs have, therefore, <lb/>both a social and economic dimension. They help beneficiaries <lb/>to integrate in the labour market through an income-generating <lb/>activity either in the form of a start-up or through increased <lb/>employability. The ultimate goal of interventions should be that <lb/>everyone, irrespective of sex, age or ethnic background, has access <lb/>to business financing tools available in the market. <lb/>Inclusive financing programmes should be flexible to accom-<lb/>modate for the different, sometimes unconventional, types of <lb/>business that disadvantaged entrepreneurs run. Women may <lb/>start a business and strive to reconcile work and family, thus <lb/>spending less time at work than the average entrepreneur. They <lb/>may also need to run a business from home, something which <lb/>also applies to entrepreneurs with physical disabilities. Migrants <lb/>often combine different activities together to guarantee their <lb/>livelihood, with the physical and legal boundaries between <lb/>different activities not always clear. Financing schemes for <lb/>inclusive entrepreneurship should adapt to these peculiarities <lb/>because they reflect some of the barriers that prevent female, <lb/>disabled and migrant entrepreneurs from access to traditional <lb/>sources of enterprise finance. <lb/>New sets of finance products have emerged in the market <lb/>that can serve the needs of disadvantaged entrepreneurs. <lb/>This policy brief focuses on these new tools, which offer a <lb/>more sustainable approach than traditional grants to finance <lb/>inclusive entrepreneurship. Some of these instruments (e.g. <lb/>crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending) use the power of the <lb/>Internet to shorten the distance between lenders and borrow-<lb/>ers and wipe out possible discrimination effects. Others (e.g. <lb/>loan guarantees, microcredit, alternative debt finance, and <lb/>business angels) address market failures that are more likely <lb/>to affect entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups. Still oth-<lb/>ers by-pass the market to rely on forms of self-support (e.g. <lb/>self-financing groups) or try to dovetail market rules with moral <lb/>principles (e.g. Islamic finance). Supply-side interventions need <lb/>to be combined with financial education to improve the financial <lb/>literacy skills of disadvantaged entrepreneurs. In the case of <lb/>our target groups, barriers to access to finance are in fact not <lb/></body>

			<body>only of market nature, but also involve limited understanding of <lb/>the credit market (e.g. loan application process, interest rates, <lb/>time value of money, etc.). <lb/>The policy brief proceeds as follow. First, data on access to <lb/>finance by women, young and low-educated entrepreneurs <lb/>are presented to give an overview of the challenge facing <lb/>policy makers who want to promote access to finance for <lb/>disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Second, the main types of <lb/>barriers in access to finance for these target groups are <lb/>discussed. Third, policies to finance inclusive entrepreneur-<lb/>ship are discussed at length. The focus is mainly on emerging <lb/>mechanisms, with an emphasis also on operational aspects <lb/>that can help policy makers to introduce these schemes. <lb/>Conclusions restate the main findings and policy recom-<lb/>mendations of the brief. <lb/>THE SCALE AND NATURE OF THE FINANCING CHALLENGE <lb/>External finance as a start-up barrier <lb/>Survey evidence from across the European Union indicates <lb/>that obtaining external finance is a major barrier to business <lb/>start-up across all socio-demographic groups (Figure 1). (1) <lb/>More than one-half of new entrepreneurs across all groups <lb/>consider obtaining finance to be an important problem, the <lb/>only exceptions being entrepreneurs aged above 40 and those <lb/>with post-secondary education. The low-educated and young <lb/>entrepreneurs have the greatest problems in this respect. More <lb/>men than women entrepreneurs report obtaining financing as <lb/>( 1 ) <lb/>One of the best sources of data on access to finance by socio-<lb/>demographic groups is the EUROSTAT Factors of Business Success <lb/>(FOBS) survey, which was unfortunately conducted only in 2005 on <lb/>business founders from 15 EU countries participating on a voluntary <lb/>basis. The survey covered enterprises born in 2002, that had survived <lb/>to 2005, and that were still managed by the founder at the time of the <lb/>survey. It covered Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, <lb/>France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, <lb/>Slovenia and Sweden. Dating back to 2005, the survey does not take <lb/>into account the consequences of the global economic crisis (2008) <lb/>and of the largest EU enlargement to Eastern Europe (2004). <lb/>having been a major problem in the start-up phase, although <lb/>the difference is minimal. This possibly reflects the nature of <lb/>the enterprises women tend to start. Women entrepreneurs <lb/>are disproportionally present in the services sector, which has <lb/>lower entry costs, and are more likely to start a business driven <lb/>by the need to combine family and work (OECD, 2012). Thus, <lb/>women entrepreneurs have lower financial needs on average <lb/>than male entrepreneurs. On the other hand, there is evidence <lb/>of undercapitalisation of many women-owned businesses, and <lb/>greater reliance on bootstrapping and short-term loans, which <lb/>tend to increase vulnerability to bankruptcy (OECD, 2012). (2) <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">( 2 ) <lb/>Bootstrapping can be defined as the use of internal sources to meet the <lb/>resource needs of a business without relying on external finance. This <lb/>includes minimisation of accounts receivable, joint utilisation of machinery, <lb/>delaying payments, and minimisation of capital invested in stocks. <lb/></note>

			<body>Sources of start-up finance <lb/>Figure 2 shows the main sources of finance used for business start-<lb/>up across different socio-demographic groups. The 3Fs of founder, <lb/>family and friends are the main source of start-up finance for all <lb/>groups. However, thanks to greater savings or possibly greater risk <lb/>propensity, male, older and higher-educated entrepreneurs are more <lb/>likely than others to draw on their own personal resources to set up a <lb/>business activity. This is confirmed by a country-based examination <lb/>of &quot; nascent entrepreneurs &quot; (Figure 3), (3) which shows how in most EU <lb/>countries senior nascent entrepreneurs are more likely than junior <lb/>nascent entrepreneurs to expect financing their business without <lb/>any external contribution. The median value for nascent entrepre-<lb/>neurs that foresee to fully self-finance their business is 53% for <lb/>senior entrepreneurs (Italy), but only 38% for young entrepreneurs <lb/>(Slovenia). With respect to women and low-educated entrepreneurs, <lb/>the median value stands respectively at 51% (Finland) and 45% <lb/>(Greece). Given the overwhelming role that personal resources play <lb/>in the financing of start-ups, this enables men and older people <lb/>to get more easily involved in entrepreneurship and develop stur-<lb/>dier businesses. At the same time, this signals a problem for other <lb/>groups, which tend to be forced to make greater use of &quot; financial <lb/>assistance from family and friends &quot; . Women and young people and, <lb/>to a lesser extent, low-educated entrepreneurs, are more likely than <lb/>others to resort to this source of start-up finance (Figure 2). <lb/>Apart from use of own funds and funds from family and friends, <lb/>the main sources of funding are bank loans, public authorities, <lb/>capital contributions from other enterprises and venture capital <lb/>( 3 ) <lb/>Based on the definition of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, <lb/>nascent entrepreneurs are people actively involved in setting up a <lb/>business they will own or co-own. <lb/>(Figure 2). Access to these sources can be vital to the ability of <lb/>entrepreneurs to make the necessary start-up investments and <lb/>to cover operating costs until revenues flow in. However, there <lb/>are important differences across socio-demographic groups in <lb/>their abilities to access external funding sources. <lb/>For example, male entrepreneurs are more likely than female entre-<lb/>preneurs to use bank loans to fuel the start-up process. Interestingly, <lb/>the gender gap is bigger for uncollateralised loans than for collater-<lb/>alised loans. On the other hand, the level of education is not a strong <lb/>determinant of access to loans. Business founders with primary and <lb/>lower secondary education are those more likely to have used both <lb/>uncollateralised and collateralised loans to launch an enterprise. <lb/>Other financial sources are less important on average. However, <lb/>public financial support has made a contribution to business start-up <lb/>by a significant group of entrepreneurs. Women and youth are the <lb/>categories of entrepreneurs most likely to be targeted by public <lb/>financial support. Results on levels of education are again not as <lb/>straightforward as for sex and age, with entrepreneurs with upper <lb/>secondary and tertiary education more likely to receive financial aid. <lb/>One explanation could lie in the better ability of higher-educated <lb/>entrepreneurs to disentangle themselves in the twists and turns of <lb/>the bureaucracy involving access to public financial support. <lb/> &quot; Access to venture capital &quot; gives very similar results. Male, senior <lb/>and higher-educated entrepreneurs report considerably more often <lb/>than the others the use of venture capital to set out a business, <lb/>although the percentages remain small across all social groups. <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>Figure 3 looks at the financing issue from another point of view, <lb/>namely the proportion of people who fully self-finance their busi-<lb/>ness start. The graph shows that a substantial minority of people <lb/>start up their business using entirely their own funding in all coun-<lb/>tries, but that self-funding tends to be higher in certain countries <lb/>like the Netherlands and Denmark than others such as Austria, <lb/>Latvia and Romania. However, the interpretation is complicated by <lb/>the fact that two separate issues are likely to be in play. On the one <lb/>hand, people with substantial own resources may decide to finance <lb/>themselves rather than seek external finance. On the other hand, <lb/>people who are refused external finance, or are discouraged from <lb/>seeking it, will be forced to use their own resources even though <lb/>this may constrain the development of their business. In terms <lb/>of specific target groups, seniors used self-financing more than <lb/>youth in fourteen of the nineteen countries. This is likely to reflect <lb/>the greater resources available to seniors. In northern European <lb/>economies such as Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, <lb/>a very large proportion of women fully self-finance their business <lb/>start-up, which may be the result either of sufficient personal sav-<lb/>ings or of lower capital needs required by the business they set out <lb/>(e.g. part time business or in low-cost services), whereas in eastern <lb/>and southern European countries the proportion of self-sufficient <lb/>women entrepreneurs is lower, pointing to limited personal savings <lb/>possibly due to lower participation in the labour market. <lb/>Figure 3. Self-financed nascent entrepreneurs across socio-demographic groups in selected EU countries, 2007-2010 <lb/>Proportion of nascent entrepreneurs who expect to fully self-finance their business start-up <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>U K <lb/>S w e d e n <lb/>S p a i n <lb/>S lo v e n i a <lb/>R o m a n i a <lb/>P o r t u g a l <lb/>N e t h e r la n d s <lb/>L a t v i a <lb/>It a ly <lb/>Ir e la n d <lb/>H u n g a r y <lb/>G r e e c e <lb/>G e r m a n y <lb/>F r a n c e <lb/>F i n la n d <lb/>D e n m a r k <lb/>C r o a t i a <lb/>B e lg i u m <lb/>A u s t r i a <lb/>Total population <lb/>Senior (40+) <lb/>Female <lb/>Low-educated (I edu. or less) <lb/>Young (&lt;30) <lb/>% <lb/>Source: OECD based on GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) database. <lb/>Note: Years from 2007 to 2010 have been pooled due to limited number of observations on single years. <lb/>The use of start-up loans across countries <lb/>The Figure 4 shows that there are some significant differences <lb/>in the use of start-up loans by entrepreneurs from disadvan-<lb/>taged and under-represented groups. The highest proportions <lb/>of loan beneficiaries are in Denmark and Austria, where the <lb/>percentages of women, youth and low-educated people receiv-<lb/>ing bank loans to set out an enterprise were much higher than <lb/>those in, for example, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. <lb/>Wide national differences point to the importance of targeted <lb/>approaches to financing inclusive entrepreneurship. Since Eastern <lb/>Europe does worse than Western Europe, there is scope for using <lb/>the European Social Fund to make strides in strengthening inclu-<lb/>sive entrepreneurship. It may well be possible that within-country <lb/>differences are deeper than cross-country ones, which would sug-<lb/>gest the need for a place-based approach where regional authori-<lb/>ties design bespoke programmes to enhance access to finance by <lb/>social target groups and where national programmes are flexible <lb/>enough to be tailored to different local economic contexts. <lb/>EU western countries should also take action. National compar-<lb/>ative data on resort to start-up loans would show that women, <lb/>young, and low-educated entrepreneurs perform worse than <lb/>male, senior and high-educated entrepreneurs also in the west <lb/>of the EU (Austria, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and <lb/>Sweden). In fact, across the whole range of FOBS-surveyed <lb/>countries, the biggest gender gap (47.3% for men vs. 38.9% for <lb/>women) and the biggest age gap (28.8% for senior vs. 20.3% <lb/>for young) were respectively found in Denmark and Italy. <lb/></body>

Its importance <lb/>has increased following the 2008 global economic crisis and <lb/>the 2011 sovereign debt crisis that have resulted in a credit <lb/>crunch forcing many entrepreneurs to shut down their business <lb/>(see Box 2). Figure 5, based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor <lb/>(GEM) data, confirms, but to a lower extent, the divide between <lb/>Eastern and Western Europe with respect to access to finance <lb/>for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Since GEM data are more <lb/>recent than FOBS data, this might signal that the east-west <lb/>gap is being bridged. <lb/>With respect to gender, Hungary is the country where the <lb/>highest share of women ex-entrepreneurs reports problems <lb/>in obtaining finance as having been the most important reason <lb/>for exit (40.2%), although the proportion for men is also high <lb/>(37.4%). (4) Best performers are Sweden and the UK, where <lb/>only 1.9% and 3.6% of female respondents mentioned lack <lb/>of external finance as the main reason to close their business. <lb/>Positive situations are also found in Eastern Europe. The Czech <lb/>Republic and Slovakia, for example, do better than France, <lb/>Spain or Belgium. <lb/>Within-country gaps are also important. In the case of gender, <lb/>women are less likely to search for external finance and are <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">( 4 ) <lb/>The perception of a generally tight credit market in Hungary is <lb/>corroborated also by the other socio-demographic variables taken into <lb/>consideration in this section. <lb/>therefore expected to report less than men lack of finance as <lb/>the most important reason for business exit. GEM data confirm <lb/>this assumption and show that in most countries male entre-<lb/>preneurs are more likely than female entrepreneurs to report <lb/>problems in obtaining finance as the main reason for business <lb/>closure. Countries with the biggest gender gap (i.e. women <lb/>showing higher rates) are Estonia (above 5 percentage points) <lb/>and Hungary (nearly 3 percentage points). <lb/>The age variable confirms that some eastern European coun-<lb/>tries have made strides in providing disadvantaged entrepre-<lb/>neurs with better access to credit. After the UK (7%), Slovakia <lb/>(7.8%) and Poland (9.1%) are the countries where the smallest <lb/>proportions of young ex-entrepreneurs (aged 18-29) report lack <lb/>of finance as the main reason to have closed their business. <lb/>Slovenia (34.6%) and the Netherlands (31.8%) are the coun-<lb/>tries where the highest percentages of young entrepreneurs <lb/>have decided to exit the market due to lack of finance. The <lb/>two are also the countries where the highest within-country <lb/>gaps between young and older entrepreneurs (aged 40-64) <lb/>are observed: 25.8 percentage points in the Netherlands and <lb/>17.4 percentage points in Slovenia. <lb/>The east-west divide in the EU is stronger when one looks at <lb/>reasons for exit among low-educated entrepreneurs (primary <lb/>degree or less), although Croatia and Slovakia are exceptions. As <lb/>much as 50% of Latvian and 46.8% of Hungarian low-educated <lb/>entrepreneurs have exited the market mainly due to problems in <lb/>obtaining finance, while the corresponding proportion is as low <lb/>as 3% and 5% in Finland and Ireland. Within-country education <lb/>gaps show that the low-educated face comparatively worse <lb/></note>

			<body>conditions in Eastern Europe. The gap between the proportion <lb/>of low-educated and high-educated (post-secondary degree) <lb/>ex-entrepreneurs who report lack of external finance as the <lb/>principal motivation to have closed their business is 27.9 per-<lb/>centage points in Latvia and 13.6 percentage points in Poland. <lb/>In some countries such as Spain and France, however, the trend <lb/>is reversed, thus confirming that the entrepreneur&apos;s level of edu-<lb/>cation is not always a strong determinant of access to finance. <lb/>To wrap up, there is much heterogeneity across countries and <lb/>socio-demographic groups. Some countries in Eastern Europe <lb/>do better than others in the region or even in Western Europe. <lb/>However, low-educated entrepreneurs are still faced with generally <lb/>adverse conditions in most of Eastern Europe. This signals a policy <lb/>priority area for the entire region. In Western Europe the group that <lb/>needs most attention is the youth. The situation is very negative in <lb/>the Netherlands, possibly because of the effects of the crisis, but <lb/>large countries such as France, Italy and Spain also see the youth <lb/>at a disadvantage when looking for finance to save their business. <lb/>On the other hand, in these countries low-educated entrepreneurs <lb/>are not more likely than high-educated entrepreneurs to report lack <lb/>of finance as the main reason to close their business. <lb/>Figure 5.

			<body>Box 1 The impact of the crisis and new banking regulations <lb/>The economic crisis has dragged on in Europe since 2008, firstly through the failure and retrenchment of financial institutions <lb/>and then because of the sovereign debt crisis. The crisis has had a severe impact on small business financing. Loan rejections at <lb/>EU-27 aggregate level rose from 12% to 18% between the first and second half of 2009 and then fell back to 11% in 2010 and <lb/>2011. Loan terms for small firms also worsened comparatively to large firms, and the interest rate spread between SMEs and <lb/>large enterprises widened (OECD, 2012). <lb/>The crisis has had a disproportionate impact on SMEs in southern Europe and Ireland. Between 2007 and 2010 there was a <lb/>drop in fully successful loan applications by SMEs from 97% to 53% in Ireland, from 87% to 59% in Spain and from 88% <lb/>to 60% in Greece (Eurostat, 2011). The outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in summer 2011 is likely to have made access <lb/>to SME loans even more difficult, and SMEs in Greece, Portugal and Italy reported strong increases in their need for bank <lb/>loans over the period from October 2012 to March 2013 (ECB, 2013). <lb/>In addition to suffering a credit crunch, SMEs in southern Europe and Ireland have also experienced a deterioration of credit <lb/>conditions. Between 2010 and 2011, both the average SME interest rate and the interest rate spread between loans for <lb/>SMEs and loans for large firms increased in Ireland, Spain and Italy. In Portugal, the interest rate spread marginally decreased <lb/>only because the average interest rate for large companies augmented comparatively more than the average SME interest <lb/>rate, which nonetheless rose by over 1% (OECD, forthcoming). <lb/>The crisis also seems to be having an impact on the inflow of new entrepreneurs. The Flash Eurobarometer surveys show <lb/>that lack of available financial support was considered a difficulty to business start-up by 79% of EU-27 respondents in <lb/>2012, 4 percentage points higher than in 2007 (75%), although this had dropped by 2 percentage points from the peak in <lb/>2009 (81%). The biggest toll on entrepreneurship activity appears to be in those countries hit hardest by the crisis (Greece, <lb/>Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal), while others (Germany and Finland) have advanced well along the road to recovery. <lb/>Figure 6.

While <lb/>the entire reform will become fully operational only in 2019 and it cannot be predicted how banks will react to increased <lb/>capital requirements, there are two issues which will need to be monitored. <lb/>First, the banks&apos; ratio of core Tier-1 capital (common equity and retained earnings) to risk-weighted assets will increase from <lb/>2% to 7%, with a counter-cyclical buffer of 0%-2.5% that can be added at a national level if the country&apos;s macroeconomic <lb/>conditions require it. Second, for most banks the risk of assets will be assessed by standard external credit ratings that <lb/>typically provide a risk weight of 75%-100% for business loans versus a credit risk of 20% for AAA to AA-rated products <lb/>and 50% for A+ to A-rated products such as sovereign debt and inter-bank claims (OECD, 2012). These reforms, which are <lb/>aimed at strengthening the resilience of the financial system, could reduce the willingness of banks to advance loans for new <lb/>business start-ups and may call for a public policy response such as through increasing credit guarantees and microcredit. <lb/>Source: EC (2010, 2012, 2013a); OECD (2012a; forthcoming); ECB (2013). <lb/></body>

			<body>BARRIERS TO OBTAINING FINANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED <lb/>AND UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP <lb/>The barriers that make access to finance difficult for entre-<lb/>preneurs from social inclusion target groups fall in four main <lb/>areas: market barriers, cultural barriers, skills barriers and <lb/>institutional barriers: <lb/>Market barriers. Credit markets suffer from information asym-<lb/>metries between lenders and borrowers. Often, banks do not <lb/>have sufficient information to judge the viability of business <lb/>proposals, especially in the case of new firms. Thus, they pro-<lb/>vide credit against the provision of collateral that can be seized <lb/>in the case of loan defaults (i.e. asset-based lending). Since <lb/>members of disadvantaged and under-represented groups in <lb/>entrepreneurship tend to own fewer collateral assets (e.g. real <lb/>estate property, vehicles, etc.), their loan requests are more <lb/>likely to be rejected. There is also evidence that banks supply <lb/>more finance to people with large personal wealth (Avery et <lb/>al., 1998), which further penalises women, young and ethnic-<lb/>minority entrepreneurs. In principle, banks could apply higher <lb/>interest rates to compensate for the higher risk-profile of disad-<lb/>vantaged entrepreneurs. However, such a strategy would attract <lb/>risk-prone borrowers, leading to adverse selection. Borrowers <lb/>might also be induced into riskier projects to pay back larger <lb/>loan instalments, which would also result in higher chances of <lb/>loan defaults (i.e. moral hazard). The result of these market <lb/>failures is to prevent equal access to finance by entrepreneurs <lb/>from socially excluded populations. <lb/>Cultural barriers. Bank loan officers are trained to deal with <lb/>a type of business in which the entrepreneur works full-time. <lb/>Migrant entrepreneurs who manage different businesses at <lb/>the same time or women entrepreneurs working part-time <lb/>in their enterprise may be credit-rationed because they fall <lb/>out of this prototype of client. Cases of social discrimination <lb/>towards ethnic minority or female entrepreneurs are also pos-<lb/>sible, although there is not strong evidence of this in EU credit <lb/>markets (OECD/EC, 2013). Cultural barriers also occur on the <lb/>demand side of credit markets. Migrant and ethnic minority <lb/>entrepreneurs may face language and social barriers to building <lb/>a close and confident relationship with banks. Some groups, <lb/>for example, may be unwilling to share full information on <lb/>personal revenues and indebtedness with loan officers, who are <lb/>perceived as outsiders. Women and youth may not approach <lb/>banks because they think that on average female and young <lb/>entrepreneurs are less likely to obtain a loan than male and <lb/>senior entrepreneurs, thus turning into &quot; discouraged borrowers &quot; <lb/>(Kon and Storey, 2003). This is especially true when members <lb/>of these groups have experienced prolonged periods of labour <lb/>market inactivity. <lb/>Skills barriers. Most loan applications are rejected because the <lb/>information submitted is incomplete or wrong. This happens <lb/>more often for entrepreneurs that do not belong to the male <lb/>white mainstream group. Three common skills barriers involve <lb/>business planning, business management and financial literacy. <lb/>Many of the people from disadvantaged and under-represented <lb/>groups in entrepreneurship who first approach external sup-<lb/>pliers of finance have never developed a business plan and <lb/>have never managed an enterprise before, whereas these are <lb/>common requirements of lending institutions to give credit. <lb/>Members of some social target groups (such as low-educated, <lb/>migrant and senior entrepreneurs) may also lack a good grasp <lb/>of business finance concepts that are key to understanding <lb/>the risks and opportunities associated with an entrepreneurial <lb/>venture (e.g. interest rates, time value of money, etc.). Skills <lb/>barriers can be addressed through business advice, mentoring <lb/>schemes and financial education programmes. <lb/>Institutional barriers. There are a number of potential problems <lb/>in the way that finance institutions operate that can affect entre-<lb/>preneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups. <lb/>For example, some forms of microcredit do not enable ben-<lb/>eficiaries to build a credit history, which could eventually help <lb/>them to obtain loans from senior lending institutions at lower <lb/>interest rates than those offered in the microfinance sector. Lack <lb/>of legislation about new sources of finance relevant to disad-<lb/>vantaged entrepreneurs is another example of an institutional <lb/>barrier. The diffusion of the Internet has made new sources of <lb/>finance possible (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending), <lb/>but only recently have policy makers started to legislate on these <lb/>new channels of business finance. Furthermore, it is generally <lb/>not enough to enforce a law or introduce a new programme <lb/>to improve the provision of finance, but it is also important to <lb/>inform would-be beneficiaries about the change. Information and <lb/>awareness-raising initiatives are key to overcoming this barrier. <lb/>TRADITIONAL POLICIES FOR FINANCING BUSINESS <lb/>START-UP BY EXCLUDED GROUPS <lb/>Given the difficulties people from disadvantaged and under-<lb/>represented groups in entrepreneurship face in obtaining <lb/>finance for business start-ups, governments and develop-<lb/>ment agencies have traditionally provided support to correct <lb/>or compensate for the finance gap. The commonly employed <lb/>tools have been grants and soft loans. These remain highly <lb/>relevant today and can work together with or in place of some <lb/>of the new financing mechanisms that are beginning to emerge. <lb/></body>

			<body>Grants and income subsidies <lb/>Grants and income subsidies are capital transfers by which <lb/>money ownership is transferred from one party (i.e. the gran-<lb/>tor) to another (i.e. the grantee). It is not uncommon for public <lb/>programmes to transfer grants and subsidies under certain con-<lb/>ditions, for example with respect to the final use of the grant. <lb/>Conditionalities are set to prevent misuse of public resources. <lb/>Grants and subsidies have traditionally been used by policy <lb/>makers to help deprived groups to integrate or re-integrate <lb/>in the labour market (e.g. job creation schemes and wage <lb/>subsidies). More recently, they have also been employed to <lb/>stimulate entrepreneurial activity. The best known example of <lb/>an income-subsidy policy for nascent entrepreneurs is from <lb/>Germany, which since the mid-1980s has experimented with <lb/>schemes that foster business creation among the unemployed. <lb/>Box 2 Germany&apos;s New Start-Up Subsidy <lb/>Target Group: People eligible for unemployment benefits under Germany&apos;s federal legislation. <lb/>Intervention type: Income-subsidy policy, combined with additional support services such as business planning and coaching. <lb/>It provides an income subsidy (i.e. the unemployment benefit) and a small grant to secure the livelihood of the unemployed <lb/>person starting a business and partly overcome the capital constraints associated with the start-up phase. <lb/>Objectives: Help unemployed people to enter the labour market via self-employment. It is especially conceived for those <lb/>groups that are faced with discrimination in the labour market or whose skills and competencies suffer from low demand, <lb/>as well as for regions and industries undergoing structural change. <lb/>Entry requirements: Being eligible for unemployment benefits under German federal legislation and approval of a business <lb/>plan by an external source (e.g. Chambers of Commerce). <lb/>Programme length: 9 months. <lb/>Description: The new Start-Up Subsidy (New SUS) was created in 2006 to merge the two previous programmes targeting <lb/>self-employment by the unemployed in Germany: the Bridging Allowance and the Start-up Subsidy. It provides the unem-<lb/>ployed with the benefit she or he would otherwise be eligible for over the first 9 months of the start-up phase. A monthly <lb/>lump sum of EUR 300 is also transferred for the same time period to cover social contribution requirements; the latter can <lb/>also be extended for another 6 months. <lb/>Results achieved: Robust evaluation results are available for the former Bridging Allowance, which was subsequently <lb/>merged into the new Start-Up Subsidy with a very similar design. By comparing the performance of participants with non-<lb/>participants eligible for the programme, the evaluation points to positive income and employment effects especially for <lb/>the low-educated, the youth and women, reaching the conclusion that the approach is more effective for groups that are <lb/>disadvantaged in the labour market or in areas where opportunities for wage employment are scarce. The evaluation study <lb/>also shows that businesses created by the unemployed are not necessarily structurally weak. Even after 5 years from the <lb/>intervention, as many as 70% of male participants in East Germany and 68% of those in West Germany were still in business, <lb/>while the lowest survival rate was for women participants in East Germany (56%). Between 30-40% of business founders <lb/>also created additional jobs beyond their own. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Unemployment benefits can be used to subsidise self-employment by the unemployed, <lb/>provided that the right set of incentives for the unemployed is in place. For example, social security contributions may have <lb/>to be paid on top of the subsidy, which should be given on a monthly basis rather than as a lump sum. Similar schemes also <lb/>work better for members of social groups that are discriminated in labour markets or in regions where wage employment <lb/>opportunities are scarce. <lb/>Source: Caliendo, 2013; Caliendo et al., 2012; Caliendo and Künn, 2011. <lb/>Soft loans <lb/>While not every entrepreneur applies for a bank loan, there <lb/>are many that do and whose request is rejected. This is <lb/>where government may intervene by targeting loans on <lb/>to people who would otherwise find it difficult to obtain <lb/>them, but who nonetheless have a viable business project <lb/>(or one that can be made viable with complementary policy <lb/>support). At the policy level many EU countries have intro-<lb/>duced subsidised loan schemes. An example is so-called <lb/> &quot; Honour Loans &quot; , which have provided many generations of <lb/>young and female entrepreneurs in Italy and France with <lb/>a combination of grants and interest-free loans. Honour <lb/>loans are called so because they are conceded against the <lb/>borrower&apos;s word of honour, without requiring collaterals or <lb/>other forms of guarantee. <lb/></body>

			<body>NEW AND EMERGING POLICY ACTIONS FOR FINANCING <lb/>BUSINESS START-UPS IN SOCIAL INCLUSION TARGET GROUPS <lb/>New financing mechanisms have recently emerged that can <lb/>help bridge the gap between lenders and investors, on the one <lb/>hand, and disadvantaged entrepreneurs, on the other. Some <lb/>(e.g. loan guarantees, business angels and Islamic finance), <lb/>have long been in place, but their potential for inclusive entre-<lb/>preneurship has not yet been fully tapped. Others (e.g. micro-<lb/>credit and self-financing groups) are relatively new but with <lb/>a certain tradition in the policy area of financing inclusive <lb/>entrepreneurship. Still others have only recently arisen thanks <lb/>to the diffusion of the Internet (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-<lb/>to-peer lending). <lb/>Loan guarantees <lb/>Loan guarantees tackle market barriers such as the lack of <lb/>collateral assets and higher risk profile of new and small enter-<lb/>prises. Loan guarantees have received increasing attention by <lb/>governments because of their advantages relative to traditional <lb/>loans and grants, namely the fact that they leverage private <lb/>sector know-how and resources through the banks participat-<lb/>ing in the programme to favour the access of disadvantaged <lb/>entrepreneurs to traditional sources of debt finance. The main <lb/>driver of banks&apos; participation in this policy is the lower credit <lb/>risk associated with publicly-or privately-guaranteed loans. <lb/>There are three main different models of loan guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes, often called also credit guarantee schemes (CGSs): <lb/>public, public-private and mutual (OECD, forthcoming). <lb/>• Public schemes: they can be either managed directly by the <lb/>government or implemented in a more decentralised man-<lb/>ner via the banking system. The first approach, which is <lb/>more common of Eastern Europe (Slovenia and Slovakia), <lb/>tends to see a stronger involvement of government agen-<lb/>cies in the decision-making process about the provision of <lb/>the loan guarantee. The second approach, shared by the <lb/>United Kingdom and the Netherlands, is implemented via <lb/>the banking sector with little if any direction on how the <lb/>guarantee scheme is managed and for which loans the public <lb/>guarantee is used.<lb/>• Public-private schemes: they involve both public and pri-<lb/>vate sector players. The government&apos;s role can be more or <lb/>less active, for example in facilitating the creation of the <lb/>programme. Irrespective of the degree of public sector <lb/>involvement, the management of the programme (e.g. risk <lb/>assessment and monitoring of the loan) is left to the lending<lb/>institutions. An example of more active involvement is given <lb/>by the Hungarian government, which sought the involvement <lb/>of both lending institutions and SME associations when it <lb/>launched its national guarantee Fund. <lb/>• Private schemes: they see the strongest commitment by <lb/>the private sector, generally through bottom-up mutual <lb/>guarantee associations that group entrepreneurs from the <lb/>same local business community (e.g. Italy) or from the same <lb/>industry (e.g. Spain). In this type of CGS, it is the mutual <lb/>guarantee associations that provide a first assessment of <lb/>the member who intends to borrow and that are involved in <lb/>the recovery of losses in case of default. The final lending <lb/>choice, nonetheless, remains with the bank, which carries out <lb/>its own full credit risk assessment. The role of the govern-<lb/>ment is limited to setting the regulatory and legal framework <lb/>and supplying financial assistance, which can take the form <lb/>of direct funding or counter-guarantees. An example of pri-<lb/>vate CGS is Italy, where the government provides a sizeable <lb/>last-resort counter-guarantee to banks on top of first-level <lb/>guarantees offered by local mutual guarantee associations <lb/>(i.e. called confidi in Italy).<lb/>A key characteristic of loan guarantee programmes is that <lb/>the final lending choice is left with banks because they <lb/>still carry a part of the risk of default, generally anything <lb/>between 20% and 50% of the loan amount. The risk profile <lb/>of guarantee-backed loans will not therefore diverge too <lb/>much from the bank&apos;s average client risk profile. As a result, <lb/>disadvantaged entrepreneurs are at risk of being left out of <lb/>mainstream CGSs. <lb/>If the government is to use CGSs to encourage inclusive entre-<lb/>preneurship, its role should thus go beyond setting the legal <lb/>framework and giving counter-guarantees. Guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes exclusively designed for entrepreneurs from target <lb/>groups (e.g. young, women, ethnic minorities) are an option, <lb/>as is the encouragement through public subsidies (e.g. con-<lb/>tributions to the registered capital, payments for the running <lb/>costs of the association, etc.) of mutual guarantee associations <lb/>among members of target groups working in similar sectors. <lb/>In both cases, governments should rely on the expertise of <lb/>private sector lending institutions for credit risk assessment. <lb/>Lenders, on their part, should continue to carry a small part of <lb/>the default risk (e.g. 10-20%), so that they have an incentive <lb/>to apply due diligence in the assessment of loan applications. <lb/>Maximum default rates should be set beforehand to make CGSs <lb/>financially sustainable for public finances. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3 Key criteria in setting up a loan guarantee programme for disadvantaged entrepreneurs <lb/>Different operational parameters need to be considered by policy makers interested in setting up credit guarantee schemes <lb/>for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. <lb/>Firm eligibility: the main eligibility criterion would be affinity to the target group. An age threshold of 3-5 years can also <lb/>be included to ensure that the programme caters for new entrepreneurs. A size limit can equally be applied to increase the <lb/>additionality of the programme, since larger SMEs should be able to obtain credit via traditional credit channels. <lb/>Guarantee assignment process: guarantees can be assigned mainly on a retail or portfolio basis. In the first case, credit risk <lb/>assessment is done on a personal basis, which implies in-depth knowledge of borrowers but also higher administrative costs. <lb/>In the second case, guarantees are provided based on some common characteristics of applicants (e.g. sector, locality, etc.). <lb/>Coverage ratio: it expresses the degree of protection over defaulted loans provided to lending institutions and can range <lb/>anywhere between 20% and 100%. Even in the case of disadvantaged entrepreneurs it is, however, recommended that a <lb/>coverage ratio above 90% is not enforced, since this will reduce the incentive for lending institutions to carry out a proper <lb/>credit risk assessment. The EU State Aid Framework sets an 80% coverage ratio when public funding is involved in the <lb/>guarantee coverage, although this threshold has been increased during the crisis up to 90%. A median coverage ratio of 80% <lb/>was also found in a survey of 76 schemes worldwide (Beck et al., 2010). A coverage ratio between 80% and 90% could be <lb/>envisaged for our target groups, depending on the hardships they are faced with and evolution of EU State Aid legislation. <lb/>Average guarantee period: it is often below 5 years and hardly ever above 10 years. In the case of new businesses, policy <lb/>makers should acknowledge that the risk associated with start-up loans tend to decrease over time, so long guarantee <lb/>periods should not be the norm (i.e. less than 5 years). In principle, borrowers who have proven to be reliable or who have <lb/>meanwhile acquired collaterals should be phased out and turned to traditional credit channels. <lb/>Pricing: CGSs typically generate revenues by applying entry fees, annual fees and loan guarantee application fees. Given <lb/>the restrained personal resources of disadvantaged entrepreneurs, policy makers should envisage a strong subsidisation <lb/>element to encourage applications and enrolment into programmes by target groups. <lb/>Additional services: CGS for entrepreneurs unable to receive credit through commercial channels should finally consider <lb/>matching the supply of credit with additional services, such as financial education (see below), to increase the likelihood <lb/>of repayment. <lb/>The following summary provides an overview of what a loan guarantee programme for disadvantaged entrepreneurs could <lb/>resemble to: <lb/>• Entrepreneur eligibility: Based on affinity to target groups and credit worthiness.<lb/>• Assignment process: Retail or portfolio-based.<lb/>• Coverage ratio: High, 80%-90% of the loan amount, but in line with EU legislation.<lb/>• Average guarantee period: Less than 5 years.<lb/>• Pricing: Strong subsidy component should be envisaged.<lb/>• Additional services: Financial education and business development advice to boost chances of repayment.<lb/>Loan guarantee programmes have several advantages from <lb/>a government point of view. They leverage on the expertise <lb/>of the banking sector for credit risk assessment, which lowers <lb/>the risks of government failures. Their cost is in large part pro-<lb/>portional to the loan default rate, so that if the programme is <lb/>run properly it will be a low-cost policy option (although large <lb/>funds will have to be set aside to cover for possible defaults <lb/>and convince banks to participate). They favour the integration <lb/>of marginal groups into the mainstream credit system and show <lb/>to commercial banks that disadvantaged entrepreneurs can <lb/>be profitable clients. On the downside, CGSs have traditionally <lb/>been conceived for the average small firm, so that their use by <lb/>disadvantaged entrepreneurs requires some tweaks. Moreover, <lb/>if the default risk is not fairly shared among the parties, the <lb/>scheme lends itself to opportunistic behaviours by lenders <lb/>and borrowers. Finally, public schemes where the government <lb/>plays an active role in the monitoring and assessment of loan <lb/>guarantees present higher operating costs and are subject to <lb/>picking-winner problems. <lb/>The pros and cons of loan guarantee programmes are con-<lb/>firmed by existing empirical evidence. Loan guarantees have <lb/>been found to improve credit conditions for SMEs (e.g. the size, <lb/>maturity and interest rates of the loans), but the evidence for <lb/>an impact on increasing the number of loan beneficiaries and <lb/>business start-ups is less conclusive. In France, the guarantee <lb/>programme operated by OSEO, the government SME financing <lb/>agency, throughout the 1990s resulted in increased loan vol-<lb/>umes and sales growth for the beneficiaries, but did not affect <lb/>the overall start-up rate in the economy (Lelarge et al., 2010). <lb/>Since then, OSEO has recalibrated the scheme towards the <lb/>needs of start-ups, which came to represent 75% of the ben-<lb/>eficiary firms and 35% of total funding in 2011 (OECD, 2013). <lb/>A series of studies on the Italian loan guarantee system also <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>suggest that the impact of loan guarantee policy is stronger <lb/>on credit conditions than on credit expansion (Columba et al, <lb/>2010; D&apos;Ignazio and Menon, 2013). In Italy, the schemes have <lb/>lowered interest rates, lengthened loan maturity and increased <lb/>loan volumes, but they have not favoured the creation of new <lb/>firms. In addition, the positive effect of affiliation to a mutual <lb/>guarantee scheme has been larger for those firms with shorter <lb/>lending relationships with banks. In the United Kingdom, on <lb/>the other hand, participation in the national Small Firm Loan <lb/>Guarantee Scheme has made beneficiary firms more likely <lb/>to export and hire new workers than similar non-borrowing <lb/>firms (Cowling, 2010). Moreover, ethnic minority businesses <lb/>and businesses located in disadvantaged areas have been over-<lb/>represented in this scheme, which has therefore strengthened <lb/>inclusive entrepreneurship in the country. <lb/>The European Commission supports loan guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes through the Joint European Resources for Micro to <lb/>Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative. Policy makers can use <lb/>EU structural funds to invest in revolving financing instruments <lb/>such as venture capital, loan or guarantee funds that promote, <lb/>among other things, the creation of new businesses. One of the <lb/>main benefits of the JEREMIE initiative is its portfolio-based <lb/>approach. National and regional Funds can allocate JEREMIE <lb/>resources to instruments with different risk profiles, thus <lb/>spreading risk across the portfolio of instruments, although <lb/>JEREMIE also requires national and local Funds to be able to <lb/>generate revenues out of the whole range of products and <lb/>become self-sustainable. This leaves policy makers with some <lb/>room for introducing relatively riskier products such as CGSs for <lb/>disadvantaged entrepreneurs, which can eventually be cross-<lb/>subsidised by safer products generating stronger revenues. <lb/>Microcredit <lb/>Microcredit aims to tackle market barriers and cultural barri-<lb/>ers at the same time, for commercial banks lend against the <lb/>provision of collateral and with a type of business in mind <lb/>that does not necessarily fit the one run by migrants, women <lb/>or young entrepreneurs. If combined with financial education <lb/>and business advice, microcredit can address skills barriers in <lb/>access to finance as well. <lb/>In the European Union microcredit refers to loans of less than <lb/>EUR 25 000 for micro-enterprises employing less than 10 employ-<lb/>ees, self-employed or unemployed and inactive people who want <lb/>to move into self-employment but do not have access to tra-<lb/>ditional banking services (EIF, 2009). Microcredit first emerged <lb/>in developing countries and reached Europe only more recently. <lb/>The first microfinance institutions (MFIs) date back to the 1980s <lb/>in Eastern Europe and to the 2000s in Western Europe. (5) This <lb/>different timing has led to a divide in the EU microcredit model. <lb/>In eastern countries, for-profit organisations and credit unions <lb/>dominate the sector, whereas in western countries the market <lb/>mainly consists of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and <lb/>non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs). <lb/>With respect to the services offer, most MFIs combine credit <lb/>with business support and other financial services (e.g. con-<lb/>sumer credit, insurances, etc.); only between 25%-30% of <lb/>European MFIs implement microcredit without additional sup-<lb/>port services (Underwood, 2006; EMN, 2010). The business <lb/>model of MFIs, therefore, relies on a combined product offer, <lb/>higher-than-average interest rates, and loan application fees. <lb/>Nonetheless, the sector still largely depends on public support <lb/>to cover both operational costs and the loan capital, as shown <lb/>by the 63% average repayment ratio of the EMN-surveyed <lb/>MFIs (EMN, 2010). (6) <lb/>Disadvantaged and underrepresented entrepreneurs are impor-<lb/>tant targets of MFIs, but less than it could be expected. Of <lb/>the 170 microcredit institutions covered by the most recent <lb/>EMN survey (EMN, 2010), as many as 44% reported targeting <lb/>women, 41% ethnic minorities and migrants, 32% the unem-<lb/>ployed, 29% the youth, and 21% the disabled. However, when <lb/>looking at the proportions of microloan clients, only 27% were <lb/>women, 13% were immigrants or members of ethnic minorities, <lb/>and 10% were young people (aged 15-24), despite the stated <lb/>desire of many MFIs to cater for these groups. The propor-<lb/>tion of women is far lower than the corresponding share in <lb/>the developing world, while immigrants and ethnic minorities <lb/>are underrepresented compared to their incidence in the EU <lb/>entrepreneurial population. <lb/>Digging more deeply into the reasons for this inconsistency sug-<lb/>gests that one issue could be discrimination against disadvan-<lb/>taged and under-represented groups, even among microcredit <lb/>providers. In the case of France, there is some evidence that <lb/>microcredit conditions (e.g. size of the loan and interest rate) <lb/>for women are worse than for men, and cannot be explained <lb/>by either the characteristics of the entrepreneur (e.g. age, work <lb/>experience, education, etc.) or those of the firm (e.g. business <lb/>size, business age, industry, etc.) (Brana, 2013). <lb/>( 5 ) <lb/>There are, however, some exceptions. For example, ADIE in France was <lb/>set up in 1989. <lb/>( 6 ) <lb/>The EMN survey provides a snapshot about the MFIs that have <lb/>responded to the questionnaire; thus this picture does not necessarily <lb/>reflect that of the EU&apos;s microcredit market as a whole. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 4 Setting up a microcredit programme <lb/>Policy makers are faced with important choices when setting up a microcredit scheme. One concerns the Fund operator, which can <lb/>either be selected through a public call for tender or be chosen without any tender among existing public institutions with experience <lb/>in Fund management. The first option has the advantage of drawing on the most cost-effective solution to the government. The <lb/>second option will ensure better coherence between the Fund&apos;s operations and the government&apos;s strategic objectives (COPIE, undated). <lb/>A second choice regards the financial intermediary organisation that will deliver the scheme, which can be an ad-hoc govern-<lb/>ment body or be chosen among existing players in the credit market (e.g. commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, <lb/>credit unions, etc.), generally through a call for tender. The first option will have the main benefit of building an organisation <lb/>tailored to its mission, but which will have high overhead costs, especially if the microcredit programme is only temporary. <lb/>The second will have the main advantage of leveraging on the expertise of players already active in the credit market, but <lb/>who may not devote the same level of attention to microcredit than to their other activities. <lb/>Microcredit schemes require an attentive distribution of costs among participants, namely government, providers and clients. <lb/>There are several fixed costs involved in a microcredit scheme, including the loan capital, operating and refinancing costs, <lb/>loan assessment and monitoring costs, etc. Additional services such as interest rebates, financial advice and education, and <lb/>business development training also imply costs for microcredit providers. <lb/>Microcredit initiatives are, therefore, unlikely to become fully self-sustainable, and policy makers should expect a strong <lb/>element of subsidisation. This will be especially true for programmes for disadvantaged entrepreneurs who may need com-<lb/>plementary services such as interest rebates and business training to be pulled in the scheme. The provision of additional <lb/>services, together with better communication targeting both disadvantaged entrepreneurs and MFIs, should be part of a <lb/>comprehensive strategy aimed at making microcredit more inclusive than has been so far. <lb/>The main advantage of microcredit is that, unlike other products <lb/>(e.g. guarantees, crowdfunding, etc.), it is a mechanism specifically <lb/>devised for entrepreneurs who experience difficulties in the credit <lb/>market. Microcredit also helps build the credit history of its clients, <lb/>thus favouring their access to traditional sources of finance. On the <lb/>other hand, microcredit is unlikely to become financially self-sustain-<lb/>able. The harder-to-reach is the target group, the stronger will be the <lb/>degree of subsidisation. A marginal risk is also that microcredit, rather <lb/>than strengthening the credit history of clients, further marginalises <lb/>them into a segmented credit market due to social stigma attributed <lb/>to microcredit clients by senior lending institutions. <lb/>There are many microcredit initiatives in the EU that deserve <lb/>attention. The case of Fair Finance in London and Crédal in <lb/>Belgium are reported in Boxes 5 and 6 to show how two dif-<lb/>ferent approaches work. <lb/>Box 5 The UK Fair Finance Microcredit Programme <lb/>Target Group: Unbankable clients who have fallen prey to money lenders applying usury loan terms. <lb/>Intervention type: Microcredit and financial education together. UK Fair Finance benefits from guarantees by the European <lb/>Progress Microfinance Facility. <lb/>Objectives: To help unbankable clients out of usury loans through fair credit conditions and financial education. Clients also <lb/>include disadvantaged entrepreneurs through loans up to GBP 10 000. <lb/>Entry requirements: Clients must present feasible financing requests, e.g. repayment of the micro loan must be possible. <lb/>Financial education is accessible for selected target groups. <lb/>Description: Fair Finance was launched in 2005 as a spin-off of two successful microcredit and debt advice programmes. The first <lb/>helped over 600 women on peer group circles and made over 300 loans to excluded women in East London. The second worked with <lb/>Local Housing Associations to provide debt advice to indebted house tenants. Today Fair Finance is a not-for-profit social enterprise that <lb/>works with unbankable clients to provide them with fair credit conditions and advice on debt management. The ultimate goal is to prevent <lb/>clients from resorting to usury loans in the black credit market that would further worsen their financial debt situation. The programme <lb/>also develops relationship with traditional banks so that unbankable clients can open bank accounts in the Fair Finance&apos;s offices. To sum <lb/>up, the range of products offered are: i) personal loans of up to GBP 2 000 at affordable rates to help clients out of usury loans; ii) loans <lb/>of up to GBP 10 000 to entrepreneurs unable to access mainstream finance to develop their business idea; iii) debt advice and financial <lb/>capability workshop to local residents to improve their financial management skills; iv) bank account access for people without one. <lb/>Results achieved: in 2011 Fair Finance secured investments from a range of social investors to build its business across <lb/>London, and commercial finance from 3 banks to expand its loan capital. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Strong leadership and strict administrative procedures are needed to launch effective <lb/>microcredit programmes; targeted approaches in microcredit result in bringing excluded groups into mainstream economy; <lb/>access to microcredit can reduce financial burdens, but not necessarily results in business development; transparency in <lb/>financing (for instance through open information on websites) is an effective tool for promotion and marketing; consider-<lb/>able time needed to attract funding from private sources for the expansion of the model; support services such as financial <lb/>education are effective in improving the general understanding of the borrowing process and can reduce over-indebtedness. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 6 Belgium&apos;s Crédal Microfinance Co-operative <lb/>Target Group: Financially excluded people due to low income, lack of guarantees or bad credit history. <lb/>Intervention type: Start-up microloans and social credit, with the participation of the European Social Fund, the Walloon <lb/>region, the Brussels region, and the banking sector. Crédal also benefits from guarantees by the European Progress <lb/>Microfinance Facility. <lb/>Objectives: To strengthen the financial inclusion of non-bankable people that would not be able to receive credit from <lb/>senior lending institutions. <lb/>Entry requirements: For start-up microloans, being interested in becoming self-employed but having been rejected by a <lb/>senior lending institution. <lb/>Programme length: Repayment period for microloans is up to 48 months. <lb/>Description: Crédal was founded in 1984 with the vision of reinforcing social cohesion. Its first activity was to finance non-<lb/>profit organisations and cooperatives through various traditional credit mechanisms at low interest rates. In 2000, Crédal <lb/>started a microcredit programme targeting credit-excluded people who wanted to start a business but could not obtain <lb/>suitable finance from traditional banks. The size of loans ranges from EUR 500 to EUR 12 500, repayment is due within 48 <lb/>months, and the charged interest rate is 5%. Microcredit is combined with other microfinance instruments such as &quot; social <lb/>credit &quot; , which addresses the transport, training or health-related needs of low-income. <lb/>Results achieved: In 2012, Crédal granted 642 microloans for business start-ups and 2 032 social loans. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Target group approach is effective; multi-stakeholder support in terms of financing is needed <lb/>in the start-up and expansion phases of the microcredit activity; subsidies for operational costs and supporting services are <lb/>justified to ensure that a fair (but still market-level) interest rate is charged. <lb/>Microcredit plays a central role in the European Union&apos;s strat-<lb/>egy for financial inclusion and inclusive growth. In 2010, the <lb/>Commission&apos;s Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs <lb/>and Inclusion set up the European &quot; Progress Microfinance &quot; <lb/>Facility, which absorbed previous smaller initiatives in the field <lb/>and represents the first EU-wide initiative designed specifically <lb/>for the microfinance sector (EC, 2013b). (7) Jointly funded by <lb/>the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, <lb/> &quot; Progress Microfinance &quot; follows a two-pronged approach. On <lb/>the one hand, it provides guarantees and counter-guarantees <lb/>to lending institutions (banks, microcredit providers, etc.) to <lb/>support their portfolios of microloans. On the other, it offers <lb/>the same eligible institutions four types of funded instruments: <lb/>senior loans, subordinated loans, risk-sharing loans and equity <lb/>participations. The guarantee mechanism has been allocated <lb/>EUR 25 million by the European Commission, while the four <lb/>funded instruments are jointly supported by the European <lb/>Commission (EUR 80 million) and the European Investment <lb/>Bank (EUR 100 million) (EIF, 2012). <lb/>In June 2013, it was decided to further integrate &quot; Progress <lb/>Microfinance &quot; into a wider EU initiative for employment and <lb/>social cohesion; the EU programme for &quot; Employment and <lb/>Social Innovation &quot; (EaSI). EASI integrates and extends the cov-<lb/>erage of three existing programmes: i) Progress (Programme <lb/>for Employment and Social Solidarity); ii) EURES (European <lb/>Employment Services); and iii) &quot; Progress Microfinance &quot; . The <lb/>latter will receive 21% of the overall EaSI budget. There will <lb/>also be extended coverage for social enterprises and funding <lb/>for capacity-building in microfinance institutions. <lb/>( 7 ) <lb/>Further information about Progress Microfinance is available <lb/>at http://ec.europa.eu/epmf <lb/>Alternative debt finance <lb/>Overdrafts, factoring, leasing and trade credit are important <lb/>sources of debt finance alternative to bank loans. There is <lb/>evidence that small businesses use these sources of finance <lb/>extensively, with more than one-quarter using trade credit, <lb/>more than one-third using leasing, hire purchase and factor-<lb/>ing, and more than one-third using credit lines and overdrafts <lb/>(European Central Bank, 2013; European Commission, 2011). <lb/>With the possible exception of trade credit, alternative sources <lb/>of debt finance are more expensive than loans and are gleaned <lb/>mainly when bank credit is unavailable or difficult to obtain. <lb/>From a policy perspective, alternative credit financing can <lb/>be influenced by national (and sometimes local) regulatory <lb/>reforms impacting on leasing contracts, factoring legislation, <lb/>fees and interest rates on overdrafts, etc. Factoring can also <lb/>be affected by public procurement to the extent that the public <lb/>administration represents an important player in this industry. <lb/>For example, one-third of transferred receivables in Italy are <lb/>from the public sector. (8) <lb/>Since entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups find it difficult <lb/>to obtain commercial bank loans, alternative debt finance is <lb/>relevant to them. Policy can help by pointing disadvantaged <lb/>and under-represented entrepreneurs to these sources of <lb/>finance, e.g. through information, advice and mentoring. It can <lb/>also lobby with banks, especially community-based ones (e.g. <lb/>savings banks and cooperative banks), to help disadvantaged <lb/>( 8 ) <lb/> &quot; The Italian job: post-crisis factoring in Italy &quot; , http://www.factorscan. <lb/>com/folder_detail.aspx?id=89F6888F-7BD0-45FF-9055-12A96B4F9EE9, <lb/>retrieved on 02/04/2013. <lb/></body>

			<body>entrepreneurs obtain a bank account and credit line. Credit lines <lb/>can be subsidised through interest rebates, which will lower the <lb/>debt burden on those who may already have limited assets and <lb/>a negative credit history. Trade credit is also relevant because <lb/>it is common in the retailing industry, where migrant and ethnic <lb/>entrepreneurs are disproportionally represented. There is scope <lb/>for raising awareness among this target group about the role <lb/>of trade credit for enterprise financing. <lb/>Crowdfunding <lb/>Crowdfunding addresses market, cultural and institutional bar-<lb/>riers in access to finance by disadvantaged entrepreneurs and <lb/>responds to the idea that enterprise financing comes from a <lb/>multitude of people who invest (small) sums, rather than from a <lb/>single large institution, usually via the Internet. The main advan-<lb/>tage for both entrepreneurs and investors lie in the low interme-<lb/>diation costs of crowdfunding, which makes it a cheaper source <lb/>of finance compared to loan and loan guarantees. Intermediation <lb/>costs are dropped for three reasons. First, the assessment of <lb/>business proposals is less thorough than for bank loans because <lb/>crowdfunding companies do not carry the risk of failure related <lb/>to the proposals they post on their web portal. Although a health-<lb/>check of business pitches is common to many platforms, there <lb/>is no incentive for them to undertake a systematic risk analy-<lb/>sis. Second, the project follow-up (i.e. monitoring costs) is also <lb/>minimal and generally left to the direct contact between the <lb/>entrepreneur and the investors, with the crowdfunding website <lb/>acting as a virtual meeting point. Third, relying strongly on the <lb/>Internet, crowdfunding portals have low fixed costs (e.g. staff <lb/>and office space). <lb/>Crowdfunding comes under four main categories, although <lb/>variants and hybrid forms co-exist (De Buysere et al., 2012): <lb/>• Donations: in crowdfunding donations are collected and ear-<lb/>marked for specific projects, which have often a social nature.<lb/>• Rewards: the investee provides the investor with a reward <lb/>that can be of non-monetary nature (e.g. the product that <lb/>the investor is financing) and which is of lower value than <lb/>the sum offered.<lb/>• Lending: thanks to lower intermediation costs, borrowers <lb/>pay a lower interest rate than for bank loans, while lenders <lb/>receive a higher interest rate than for savings deposits.<lb/>• Equity: this is less common than the other three options and <lb/>involves larger sums. Equity crowdfunding is rather similar <lb/>to the activity of business angels, although in crowdfunding <lb/>the local dimension of the investment and its business advice <lb/>component are less strong (Agrawal et al., 2011).<lb/>In the first three types of crowdfunding, suppliers of finance <lb/>are often not only motivated by profit-seeking but also by <lb/>emotional and social objectives. This, together with the <lb/>small sums involved, makes crowdfunding relevant to inclu-<lb/>sive entrepreneurship. <lb/>Crowdfunding is a very new market and estimates of its size <lb/>need to be taken with caution. De Buysere et al. (2012) report <lb/>that in 2011 there were around 200 platforms in Europe which <lb/>had raised EUR 300 million of funding. This corresponded to <lb/>one-half of the total number of platforms worldwide and <lb/>one-fourth of the global crowdfunding market (EUR 1.2 billion). <lb/>The average platform in Europe therefore raises less funding <lb/>than the global average. <lb/>The average size of the business pitch changes greatly in Europe <lb/>depending on the type of crowdfunding. It is approximately <lb/>EUR 500 for donations, EUR 3 000 for rewards, EUR 4 500 for <lb/>lending, and EUR 50 000 for equity-based crowdfunding. All <lb/>these forms of crowdfunding are on the rise in Europe, although <lb/>donations take the lion&apos;s share with respect to the absolute <lb/>number of crowdfunding campaigns. <lb/>Policy-wise, there is an increasing request for better regulation <lb/>of crowdfunding. The downside of low intermediation costs is, <lb/>in fact, low control by crowdfunding platforms on the viability <lb/>and progress of the business proposals they host. Similarly, <lb/>information on business projects is limited to what entrepre-<lb/>neurs are willing to disclose, whereas more structured and <lb/>homogenous information requirements would help investors <lb/>to make a better choice. <lb/>Since crowdfunding is a very new market and disadvantaged <lb/>entrepreneurs are not always up-to-date with the latest evo-<lb/>lutions in business financing, there is scope for strengthening <lb/>information about this financing mechanism. Financial education <lb/>of both entrepreneurs and investors will help them to understand <lb/>mutual expectations and obligations related to crowdfunding <lb/>transactions. Training and advice for disadvantaged entrepre-<lb/>neurs will have to focus on debt management issues or, should <lb/>crowdfunding be equity-based, on the implications of exter-<lb/>nal equity for business ownership and business management. <lb/>Investors, too, would benefit from help in the assessment of <lb/>business pitches. Since much of crowdfunding is also driven by <lb/>social considerations, advice will need to go beyond traditional <lb/>concepts such as returns on investment (ROI). <lb/>The relevance of crowdfunding is also related to being one <lb/>of the few equity options available to disadvantaged entre-<lb/>preneurs. Small sums of equity will be especially useful to <lb/>innovative entrepreneurial projects run by young or migrant <lb/>entrepreneurs or that address societal challenges (e.g. popula-<lb/>tion ageing, global warming, etc.). The support of equity-based <lb/>crowdfunding, however, also calls for the parallel development <lb/>of senior investors (e.g. business angels) and secondary mar-<lb/>kets to guarantee exit options for those who have invested <lb/>through equity-based crowdfunding. <lb/>Seedmatch provides an example of the potential of equity-<lb/>based crowdfunding for youth entrepreneurship. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 7 Germany&apos;s Seedmatch Crowdfunding Platform <lb/>Target Group: Start-ups looking for small sums of equity finance. <lb/>Objectives: To strengthen the capitalisation of new start-ups by making access to external equity finance possible. <lb/>Intervention type: Equity-based investment. <lb/>Programme length: Between 5 and 7 years. <lb/>Description: Seedmatch is one of the few equity-based platforms in Europe, enabling funders to invest in new start-ups <lb/>and receive shares in return. Seedmatch carries out an in-depth assessment of the business proposals, which abide by <lb/>transparency requirements, and only posts on the platform those that consider worth of investment. This means that they <lb/>target companies with innovation potential and scalable business models. They receive around 1 000 applications per year, <lb/>long-list 200, short-list no more than 50 for interview, and finally post online for investment around 25. Minimum investment <lb/>is EUR 200, while the average investment is EUR 600. From a demographic point of view, young entrepreneurs are quite <lb/>strongly represented among the business founders admitted to the stage of investment, possibly because of the &quot; new &quot; and <lb/>Internet-based nature of this model of business financing. <lb/>Results: Until now the platform counts approximately 12 500 registered users and has funded 34 business start-ups for <lb/>an investment capital of EUR 3.85 million. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Entrepreneurs must be able to clearly present their business plans and ideas to potential <lb/>investors; crowdfunding through subordinated loans and equity investments can be an effective tool for innovative start-ups; <lb/>investment exit strategies need to be in place at the outset of the funding campaign; platforms have difficulty in becoming <lb/>self-sustainable if the number and volume of transactions remain small. <lb/>Source : Molenaar, 2013 <lb/>Peer-to-peer lending <lb/>Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is similar to lending-based crowd-<lb/>funding. Interest rates in these transactions are higher than <lb/>for bank loans, this being the main rationale for the involve-<lb/>ment of lenders. However, it is not uncommon for P2P lend-<lb/>ing to be based on subordinated loans, i.e. loans that in <lb/>case of liquidation can only be claimed after borrowers <lb/>have paid senior lenders. On the borrower&apos;s side, P2P lend-<lb/>ing requires fewer personal securities than bank lending, <lb/>although higher-than-average interest rates will result in <lb/>higher levels of indebtedness. Interest rates in P2P lending <lb/>are set by managing platforms and funds, based on the <lb/>financial information and personal securities of the borrower. <lb/>In some innovative cases, peer-to-peer platforms can carry <lb/>part of the default risk or provide partial insurance against <lb/>loan defaults. <lb/>The volume of peer-to-peer lending is appraised at <lb/>EUR 20 million per month in Europe (De Buysere et al., 2012), <lb/>although estimates are only approximate. Success stories in <lb/>P2P lending platforms include Funding Circle in the UK and <lb/>Smava in Germany. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Peer-to-peer lending is meaningful to inclusive entrepre-<lb/>neurship for two main reasons. First, it will favour access to <lb/>finance to non-bankable entrepreneurs, although the risk of <lb/>over-indebtedness should not be underestimated. Secondly, <lb/>it can encourage the transfer of resources among members <lb/>of the same community (i.e. peers). This makes it relevant, <lb/>for example, to migrant and ethnic-minority entrepreneurship <lb/>thanks to the possible support of diaspora members. <lb/>The development of peer-to-peer lending will require govern-<lb/>ment action similar to the one suited for crowdfunding, covering <lb/>areas such as regulation, financial education and information. <lb/>In the case of peer-to-peer lending, improved regulation will <lb/>involve enhanced information on the borrower&apos;s profile and on <lb/>the distribution of the default risk between online platforms <lb/>and investors. (9) Reformers should however take into account <lb/>that increased transparency will entail increased costs and thus <lb/>strike the right balance between the protection of investors and <lb/>the development of new promising sources of business finance. <lb/>Policy makers can further support P2P lending for inclusive <lb/>entrepreneurship through fiscal incentives for investors and <lb/>platforms with a focus on certain target groups or, at local <lb/>level, by facilitating the matchmaking between entrepreneurs <lb/>and investors. <lb/>Business angels <lb/>Business angels are net worth individuals who invest sums <lb/>of equity finance in an unquoted business in which they have <lb/>no family connection with the goal of making a profit in the <lb/>medium to long-term. In addition to providing finance, business <lb/>angels are also a source of business advice and professional <lb/>networks. The size of business angels&apos; investment tends to <lb/>vary between EUR 25 000 and 500 000, but it can reach larger <lb/>scale when they invest through networks, clubs or syndicates. <lb/>( 9 ) <lb/>The Bank of France has, for instance, recently declared that crowdfunding <lb/>platforms would have to abide by the same obligations ruling banks and <lb/>other financial institutions, which also implies the presence of capital <lb/>requirements. Le Monde, TPE: la voie étroite du crowdfunding, 25/03/2013. <lb/>http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/03/25/tpe-la-voie-etroite-<lb/>du-crowdfunding_1853646_3234.html <lb/></note>

			<body>The business angel market in Europe is estimated at EUR 5 billion, <lb/>only 10% of which is visible through the 460 business angel <lb/>networks identified by the European Trade Association for <lb/>Business Angels (EBAN). The five biggest markets in the EU <lb/>are the UK, Spain, France, Finland and Germany, and the aver-<lb/>age investment per company is EUR 175 000. (10) <lb/>Although business angels are often associated with high-growth <lb/>entrepreneurship, they can play a role in inclusive entrepreneur-<lb/>ship, too. It should, however, be recalled that profit-making is <lb/>one of the main drivers of business angel investment, which <lb/>is therefore naturally geared towards growth-oriented sectors. <lb/>This is shown by the sector bias of business angel investment <lb/>in Europe, 70% of which goes to information and communica-<lb/>tions technologies and biotech together, while less than 10% <lb/>is directed to consumer goods and services and retail. <lb/>This helps explain why women-owned businesses, which are <lb/>less growth-oriented than men-owned businesses even within <lb/>high-tech sectors, only capture a very small fraction of busi-<lb/>ness angel investment and equity finance. (11) Women are also <lb/>less likely to become business angels, representing less than <lb/>5% of the business angel population, which may help explain <lb/>the low proportion of business angel investment directed to <lb/>women-owned businesses, although female business angels <lb/>are not particularly influenced by gender considerations in their <lb/>investment decisions (Harrison and Mason, 2007). <lb/>When female entrepreneurs look for external equity investment, <lb/>they rely extensively on their personal networks of family and <lb/>friends to reach out to business angels and win their trust <lb/>(Amatucci and Sohl, 2004). This pattern is common to the <lb/>entire business angel sector, which is small-sized and driven <lb/>by personal and affinity relationships. But it means that female <lb/>and young entrepreneurs, who have typically less extensive <lb/>personal networks, will be at a disadvantage compared to their <lb/>male and senior counterparts. For the same reasons, immigrant <lb/>entrepreneurs can benefit from business angel investment from <lb/>investors in their home countries provided that they keep ties <lb/>with the country of origin. Silicon Valley in the United States is <lb/>a case in point of a place where social networks of migrants <lb/>have evolved into professional and business associations, which <lb/>have helped build a two-way bridge where equity investments <lb/>flow between host and home countries (Saxenian, 2006). <lb/>Policy makers in the EU can support business angel investment <lb/>for socially excluded entrepreneurs in various ways. First, the <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">( 10 ) Data on the European business angel market are drawn from the EBAN <lb/> &quot; European Angel Investment Overview: 2012 &quot; . http://www.eban.org/ <lb/>wp-content/uploads/2013/07/EBAN-Angel-Investment-Overview-2012.pdf <lb/>( 11 ) In the United States, for example, women represent only 7% of venture <lb/>capital clients. <lb/>creation of affinity business angel networks can be encouraged, <lb/>for example, by subsidising their operational costs. There are <lb/>a few examples of female and diaspora angel groups already <lb/>existing in Europe, although they are more likely to operate <lb/>in places where there is a high density of entrepreneurship <lb/>that provides a constant flow of investment opportunities <lb/>(e.g. London and Cambridge in the UK) (OECD, 2011). Second, <lb/>the investment readiness of targeted entrepreneurs can be <lb/>strengthened through ad-hoc programmes that aim to enhance <lb/>the investment prospects of their business pitches. A study of <lb/>deals declined by UK business angels highlighted three domi-<lb/>nant reasons for rejection: weakness in the entrepreneur or <lb/>management team, marketing factors and flawed financial <lb/>projections (Mason and Kwok, 2010). Investment readiness <lb/>programme could start with addressing these issues. Third, <lb/>tax breaks are commonly used to stimulate the business angel <lb/>market. Special tax breaks can be envisioned for those busi-<lb/>ness angel networks that invest in enterprises launched by <lb/>members of disadvantaged and under-represented groups <lb/>in entrepreneurship. Fourth, public co-investment in business <lb/>angel networks targeting inclusive entrepreneurship is another <lb/>policy option, although policy makers should leave investment <lb/>decisions to private investors better placed to assess the growth <lb/>prospects of the financed business. Finally, initiatives that <lb/>facilitate matchmaking between investors and entrepreneurs <lb/>from disadvantaged and under-represented groups are a low-<lb/>cost policy option that can help trigger initial interest in equity <lb/>finance for inclusive entrepreneurship. <lb/></note>

			<body>Islamic finance <lb/>Muslims in Europe are estimated at 44 million (6% of the <lb/>overall population) and projected to increase to 58 million <lb/>within the next 20 years. (12) Within the European Union, esti-<lb/>mates point to about 19 million of Muslims, 3.8% of the <lb/>EU population (Pew Forum, 2011). The presence of Muslims <lb/>is stronger in Western and Northern Europe, particularly in <lb/>the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom <lb/>due to the inflow of Muslim migrants and second-generation <lb/>Muslim Europeans. Muslims are especially concentrated in <lb/>urban areas. They are 24% of the population in Amsterdam, <lb/>17% in Brussels, 10-15% in the Paris region and 8.5% in <lb/>Greater London.

			<body>Box 8 Major Islamic finance products <lb/>Some of the major Islamic finance investment vehicles are the following: <lb/>• Profit sharing (i.e. mudharabah): The investor supplies the entrepreneur with funds and receives a return, based on an <lb/>agreed profit-sharing ratio. This principle can apply both to bank deposits and business financing. Eventual losses are <lb/>suffered by the provider of capital.<lb/>• Cost plus (i.e. murabahah): This transaction involves the sale of goods at a price which includes a profit margin agreed <lb/>by both parties. However, in Murabahah, sellers must let buyers know the actual cost of the assets at the time of the <lb/>initial agreement.<lb/>• Joint venture (i.e. musharakah): It refers to a partnership in which profits will be shared based on an agreed ratio which <lb/>may not be in the same proportion of the invested amounts. On the other hand, incurred losses will be shared according <lb/>to the original ratio invested by each partner.<lb/>• Agency (i.e. wakalah): This is a contract whereby a person (principal) asks another to act on his/her behalf for a specific <lb/>task. The person who takes on the task is an agent who will be paid a fee for the service.<lb/>• Interest-free financing (i.e. quard): financing is given for a fixed period on a goodwill basis and the borrower is only required <lb/>to repay the amount borrowed. However, borrowers may pay an extra amount as a way to thank the lender if they wish so.<lb/>Source: Molenaar, 2013 <lb/>There has been a recent surge in the number of Islamic finan-<lb/>cial institutions worldwide, mainly banks and funds, although <lb/>they have so far privileged large investment operations over <lb/>lending to entrepreneurs. Many countries are behind the game <lb/>in terms of the number of Islamic finance institutions and the <lb/>volume of their lending. <lb/>Policy makers in Europe can contribute to reversing this trend <lb/>by supporting the introduction of Sharia-compliant financial <lb/>products within major commercial banks. This will most likely <lb/>require the training of loan officers charged with the offer of <lb/>Islamic finance products. Awareness-raising campaigns will also <lb/>be important on both the demand and supply sides. Muslim <lb/>entrepreneurs may be unaware of new Sharia-compliant prod-<lb/>ucts in the credit market, while financial institutions that offer <lb/>these products need to be ushered into lending to entrepreneurs. <lb/>Community-based organisations can help spread the voice about <lb/>Islamic finance opportunities among Muslim entrepreneurs. <lb/>Islamic finance can positively impact on the integration of hard-<lb/>to-reach entrepreneurs who would not look for credit unless it <lb/>abides by their religious beliefs. However, policy makers should <lb/>be aware that recent experiments to introduce Islamic finance <lb/>products have not always been successful in Europe, partly <lb/>because of the low income and low activity rates of the target <lb/>population (Stressman Foundation, 2012). <lb/>The UK is the country in the European Union where Islamic finance <lb/>has advanced the most, with the Islamic Bank of Britain stand-<lb/>ing out as the only fully Sharia-compliant bank in the country. <lb/>Box 9 Islamic Bank of Britain <lb/>Target Group: Muslims interested in financial products, not only related to business financing, compliant with Sharia law. <lb/>Objectives: To offer alternative sources of financing to segments of the UK population who, for religious beliefs, are not <lb/>willing to pay interest rates on borrowed money. <lb/>Intervention type: retail banking, mainly savings products and overdrafts facilities. <lb/>Programme length: Authorised to operate under UK banking law since 2004, including credit facilities. <lb/>Description: The Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB) offers the largest range of Sharia-compliant financial products in the UK, including <lb/>mortgage alternatives, current accounts, savings accounts, and assets management solutions. The major shareholder is Qatar <lb/>International Islamic Bank (over 80%), with the remaining 20% shared between large private investors and the general public. <lb/>Results: IBB has opened up new banking opportunities for the UK Muslim population, although the share of portfolio covered <lb/>by small businesses and individual clients remains marginal. Most business financing is still concentrated in large operations. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Faith-based schemes operate in closed target markets and are therefore subject to less <lb/>competition and to reliance on standard products; if Islamic finance is to be used for entrepreneurship financing, clear <lb/>promotion campaigns are required; Islamic banks need to devise appropriate services packages to cater for small business <lb/>owners; Islamic finance products are typically more expensive than traditional bank products. <lb/></body>

			<body>Self-financing groups <lb/>Self-financing groups are community-based systems in which <lb/>members lend to each other. They have originally arisen in <lb/>developing countries, where the most common form has <lb/>been Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA). More <lb/>recently, they have also mushroomed in Europe, namely in <lb/>Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Belgium and the Netherlands <lb/>(Molenaar, 2013). <lb/>Loans in self-financing groups are proportional to the deposits <lb/>of members. An interest rate can be applied, in which case <lb/>profits are re-invested in the group. Loans are in the range <lb/>of EUR 5 000, with repayment periods often within 6 months <lb/>and never longer than a year. The evidence from developing <lb/>countries points to high repayment rates in group lending <lb/>(Ledgerwood, 1998), although some argue that by self-select-<lb/>ing their members self-financing groups exclude those at the <lb/>very margins of the society (Green, 2005). <lb/>Self-financing groups have the potential to enhance the resil-<lb/>ience of vulnerable entrepreneurs (e.g. migrants and disabled <lb/>people), although linkages with more structured forms of <lb/>public support are important to avoid the marginalisation of <lb/>members. Policy-wise, it will therefore be important to encour-<lb/>age ties between self-financing groups and, for example, <lb/>microcredit institutions to support the financial inclusion of <lb/>group members. <lb/>Box 10 Spain&apos;s Association of Self-financed Communities (ACAF) <lb/>Target Group: Low-income people who are financially and socially excluded, often with a migrant background. <lb/>Objectives: To offer alternative sources of debt finance to non-bankable people. <lb/>Intervention type: Small sums of debt finance for income-generating activities. <lb/>Programme length: Continuous cycles of one year. <lb/>Description: Since 2004 the Spanish foundation Associación de Comunidades Autofinanciadas (ACAF) has gained expe-<lb/>rience in setting up and managing self-funded groups. Partners in ACAF involve the large-scale NGO Ashoka, the Levi <lb/>Strauss Foundation and the Catalonian regional government. Each &quot; self-funded &quot; community (CAF) can be composed of 10 <lb/>to 30 people who, through the investment of small sums, become the owners and customers of the organisation. CAFs <lb/>provide services to their members, such as credit and insurance, while generating revenues through interests applied to <lb/>loans. The model differs from traditional microcredit because it does not rely on external funds. More recently, through <lb/>the creation of the Winkomun platform (www.winkomun.org), the organisation has aimed to disseminate more effectively <lb/>the experience of CAFs, facilitate access to the methodology of how to build a CAF, and promote interaction between <lb/>members of CAF communities. <lb/>Results: Since 2004, ACAF has assisted the foundation of about 80 self-financed groups, with more than 3 500 indi-<lb/>rect beneficiaries. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Self-financing groups are an effective tool to promote social inclusion, including through <lb/>start-up funding; complementary social orientation and mobilisation programmes are needed to trigger the creation of self-<lb/>help groups; a clear structure helps accelerate the establishment and operations of self-financing groups. <lb/>Source: Molenaar, 2013 <lb/>THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION <lb/>The discussion has hitherto focused on how policy can <lb/>strengthen the supply of finance, based on evidence that some <lb/>groups of entrepreneurs are disadvantaged, if not discrimi-<lb/>nated, in credit markets (Muravyev et al. 2009; Alesina et al., <lb/>2013; Fairlie, 2010). These initiatives should be coupled with <lb/>financial education interventions aimed at overcoming skills <lb/>barriers in access to finance. The objective should be to make <lb/>disadvantaged entrepreneurs ready to receive a loan or invest-<lb/>ment at market conditions. <lb/>A recent OECD survey on knowledge, attitudes and behav-<lb/>iours around financial issues points to significant knowledge <lb/>gaps within the adult population (Atkinson and Messy, 2012). <lb/>The proportion of the population with high scores in financial <lb/>knowledge ranges between 40% in Norway and 69% in Hungary <lb/>among the EU countries covered by the survey. (14) <lb/>Strong differences in financial knowledge are observed across <lb/>different socio-demographic groups. Women have on average <lb/>lower scores than men, with a gender gap above 20 per-<lb/>centage points in Norway, Poland and the UK. While 67% of <lb/>men in Germany and the United Kingdom reach a high score <lb/>in financial knowledge, the share for women is respectively <lb/>50% and 40%. <lb/>( 14 ) The category of financial knowledge included non-specialist questions on <lb/> &quot; division &quot; , &quot; time value of money &quot; , &quot; interest paid on loan &quot; , &quot; calculation of <lb/>interest plus principle &quot; , &quot; compound interest &quot; , &quot; risk and return &quot; , &quot; definition <lb/>of inflation &quot; , &quot; diversification &quot; . <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>Age, income and level of education also matter. Respondents <lb/>with high scores in financial knowledge are most likely to be in <lb/>the age group between 30 and 60 years old, while the youngest <lb/>and oldest respondents do comparatively worse. People with <lb/>high levels of education also obtain better scores in financial <lb/>knowledge, with the largest education-based gap in financial <lb/>knowledge in Germany and Poland. Yet, people with little or no <lb/>formal education also achieve high scores, which suggests that <lb/>financial education can be delivered across a wide range of <lb/>social groups. Finally, those with high income have better finan-<lb/>cial knowledge than those with low income, although income <lb/>is also positively correlated with age and level of education <lb/>(Atkinson and Messy, 2012). <lb/>Financial knowledge influences financial attitudes and behav-<lb/>iours. Those who rank high in financial knowledge will also <lb/>show stronger propensity to saving and to appropriate financial <lb/>behaviours (e.g. sound budget management, timely payment of <lb/>bills, etc.). An exception is represented by women, who do better <lb/>than men with respect to financial attitudes and behaviours in <lb/>spite of lower scores in financial knowledge. <lb/>Improving financial literacy skills through financial education <lb/>is, therefore, an important policy area. This is especially true <lb/>for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups, since the way <lb/>they manage their business and connect with credit markets <lb/>will affect their livelihood and that of their families. In this <lb/>respect, it is generally recommended that financial educa-<lb/>tion programmes be strongly tailored, because initial financial <lb/>knowledge will vary a great deal among participants (OECD, <lb/>2012b). Programmes should also be of hands-on nature, draw-<lb/>ing on experiential and interactive methodologies. The ulti-<lb/>mate goal should be to influence attitudes and behaviours, <lb/>rather than focus on financial concepts and principles. Timing <lb/>is also important and should be close to when education is <lb/>most likely to have an impact. Including financial education <lb/>principles in vocational education colleges, self-employment <lb/>training courses or still in active labour market programmes for <lb/>the unemployed can make inclusive entrepreneurship stronger. <lb/>Policy makers should also work on the qualification and accredi-<lb/>tation of financial education providers to guarantee quality in <lb/>the offer of training, while banks and other financial institu-<lb/>tions should be encouraged to communicate with clients in a <lb/>language that is as simple as possible (OECD, 2005). <lb/>In addition to being offered through bespoke programmes, <lb/>financial education can be integrated into other schemes. This <lb/>is, in fact, the best way to deliver financial education because <lb/>training will have a practical end and will be delivered at a <lb/>time when it is most likely to have an impact. Some micro-<lb/>finance programmes (e.g. Bulgaria&apos;s JOBS Financial Leasing <lb/>– see Box 11), income-subsidy programmes (e.g. Germany&apos;s <lb/>Start-up Subsidy) and subsidised credit programmes (e.g. Italy&apos;s <lb/>Honour Loans) provide good practice examples, but still too <lb/>often financing schemes do not foresee a component that <lb/>strengthens the financial knowledge of participants. Expected <lb/>benefits from this policy change would include lower rejections <lb/>in loan applications and lower rates of loan default. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 11 &quot; Job Opportunities through Business Support &quot; (JOBS) Financial Leasing Project, Bulgaria <lb/>Target Group: Unbankable low-income people who already run a micro or small business or intend to start a new one. The <lb/>project mainly operates in rural areas (40% of the leases are granted to agricultural producers) that display high rates of <lb/>unemployment and high proportions of minority groups (e.g. Turkish and Roma minorities). <lb/>Objectives: To provide subsidised leasing for the purchase of equipment to entrepreneurs from marginalised groups, thus <lb/>favouring their social integration. <lb/>Intervention type: The provision of finance – leasing in this case – is combined with financial education and business <lb/>management training. The training component is compulsory and the leased equipment is only received after participants <lb/>have passed a test assessing their understanding of basic financial and management principles. Ownership of the leased <lb/>good is attained after full repayment of the lease. <lb/>Programme length: It varies depending on the value of the leased equipment. <lb/>Description: The JOBS Financial Leasing Project&apos;s offer has been comprehensive and flexible. It combines the supply of <lb/>leasing finance with business support services such as financial education and business management training. Future <lb/>entrepreneurs must complete 20 hours of training, after which they sit an examination where they have to answer correctly <lb/>80% of the questions. However, those who already manage a business can try to pass the test without going through the <lb/>full training course. <lb/>The JOBS Financial Leasing Project caters for both existing and future entrepreneurs. The latter are targeted through the <lb/>Start-with-Leasing programme. For new entrepreneurs the only condition to receive support is to have a viable business <lb/>idea that will result into the hiring of at least one additional person. The programme is also tailored to the special needs of <lb/>Roma entrepreneurs, who receive longer repayment terms and grace periods and are requested a smaller advance payment. <lb/>The programme is delivered by 42 business centres and 10 business incubators, which have been set up at local level by <lb/>local labour offices, municipalities and other public and private-sector organisations. Centres and incubators take the legal <lb/>status of not-for-profit organisations and are in charge of the purchase of the leased equipment and of the financial educa-<lb/>tion and business development courses. <lb/>Results: From 2000 to 2008, 1 985 companies were supported by the scheme through EUR 10.4 million in leasing finance, <lb/>34 660 people obtained stable employment, and nearly 53 500 benefitted from training courses. The programme has grown <lb/>in popularity throughout the 1990s, and business incubators and business centres have become able to generate revenues <lb/>by leasing equipment to participants. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: Financial education, together with business development training, should be a key component <lb/>of programmes that supply finance for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups; business support <lb/>services such as training and advice should be delivered both before and during the period of financial support; leasing can <lb/>be an important component of microfinance programmes, provided that adequate measures are taken to prevent frauds <lb/>(e.g. public registration of equipment) and intense marketing of clients is undertaken. <lb/>Source: http://goodpracticeroma.ppa.coe.int/en/pdf/110 <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Women, migrant, young and low-educated entrepreneurs expe-<lb/>rience difficult access to credit and credit conditions. Although <lb/>cases of open discrimination are possible, this is more often <lb/>the outgrowth of firm-specific and market-specific factors: e.g. <lb/>low entrepreneurial and financial literacy skills of the entre-<lb/>preneur and undercapitalisation or low growth prospects of <lb/>the business. The mere supply of finance is unlikely to solve <lb/>alone a condition of multifaceted disadvantage. Programmes <lb/>financing inclusive entrepreneurship should be aligned with <lb/>other initiatives supporting entrepreneurial skills and market <lb/>development skills. <lb/>Grants and subsidised credit have proven effective in the past <lb/>in helping the self-employment of hard-to-reach groups (e.g. <lb/>the unemployed and the youth), although they are an expensive <lb/>policy in a time of public budget constraints. Emerging financing <lb/>schemes can complement traditional policies. Loan guarantee <lb/>programmes have been applied in many EU countries (e.g. Italy, <lb/>France, Denmark, the Netherlands, etc.). However, the main <lb/>focus of credit guarantee schemes has been on traditional small <lb/>enterprises, while their ability to reach disadvantaged new <lb/>entrepreneurs needs be strengthened. This recommendation <lb/>also applies to microcredit. At the EU level, women and migrants <lb/>are underrepresented among the clients of MFIs compared to <lb/>the share they represent in the entrepreneurial population. <lb/>Targeted microcredit programmes are warranted to ensure that <lb/>these groups are not excluded from a financing mechanism <lb/>that is important for the goals of inclusive entrepreneurship. <lb/>New Internet-based sources of finance (e.g. crowdfunding and <lb/>peer-to-peer lending) hold the potential to foster inclusive <lb/>entrepreneurship mainly in light of the small sums they provide <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>and the emotional drive that motivate investors. Nonetheless, <lb/>EU and national legislations ruling these platforms will have <lb/>to be strengthened to prevent frauds and provide investors <lb/>with more transparent information on the companies seek-<lb/>ing finance. <lb/>Finally, supply-side interventions need to be coupled with others <lb/>that improve the skills of the entrepreneur. Financial educa-<lb/>tion will help disadvantaged entrepreneurs to achieve a better <lb/>understanding of the credit system and increase their chance <lb/>to have loan requests approved. <lb/>The following recommendations are put forward: <lb/>• Monitor the extent to which entrepreneurs from groups <lb/>disadvantaged in the labour market (e.g. youth, migrant, <lb/>low-educated) or underrepresented in the entrepre-<lb/>neurial population (e.g. women and seniors) experi-<lb/>ence more difficult access to finance than mainstream <lb/>male entrepreneurs.<lb/>• Ensure that government-supported loan guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes and microcredit schemes adequately reach socially<lb/>disadvantaged entrepreneurs and, if this is not the case, <lb/>take remedial action by either setting up special sections <lb/>in mainstream schemes, or by launching new targeted pro-<lb/>grammes aimed at disadvantaged entrepreneurs (women <lb/>and youth entrepreneurs). <lb/>• Expect to provide a strong subsidy component to loan guar-<lb/>antee and microcredit programmes that specifically target <lb/>entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups.<lb/>• Raise awareness among entrepreneurs about the potential of <lb/>Internet-based financing tools (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-<lb/>to-peer lending), but also introduce adequate legislation to <lb/>avoid misuse and protect investors.<lb/>• Encourage linkages between community-based tools, such <lb/>as self-financing groups, and more structured government <lb/>programmes aimed at strengthening general access to finance <lb/>for entrepreneurs.<lb/>• Combine supply-side policies with improved financial literacy <lb/>skills amongst disadvantaged entrepreneurs to enhance their <lb/>chances of obtaining finance in credit markets.<lb/></body>

			<body>GLOSSARY <lb/>Basel III – Set of new rules and regulations governing the banking sector introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 global economic <lb/>crisis and that will become fully operational by 2018. These rules mainly provide for higher capital and liquidity requirements, <lb/>with the aim of making banks more resilient to future economic crises. <lb/>Collateral assets – Assets required of borrowers by lenders to issue a loan. They usually include goods (real estate, <lb/>vehicles, etc.) that can be seized, totally or partly, by the lender in the event of loan default. <lb/>Crowdfunding – A collective transfer of relatively small resources through lending or equity investment into an entrepreneurial <lb/>project. This is usually done with the help of an Internet platform acting as a virtual meeting point between entrepreneurs <lb/>and investors. <lb/>Factoring – The sale of accounts receivable by an enterprise to a factoring company at a discounted value. It is used to cope <lb/>with cash-flow emergencies when entrepreneurs prefer receiving a discounted payment immediately rather than await the full <lb/>payment of receivables later. <lb/>Financial education – The process by which financial consumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products, <lb/>concepts and risks and, through information, instruction and/or objective advice develop the skills and confidence to become more <lb/>aware of financial risks and opportunities to make informed choices, to know where to go for help, and take other effective actions <lb/>to improve their financial well-being (OECD, 2005). <lb/>Islamic Finance – Financing activity in compliance with Sharia law that forbids the charge of interest rates by lenders on <lb/>borrowers. Lending is not ruled out, but lenders are treated as stakeholders. It has so far been more commonly used by large <lb/>investment funds than to support entrepreneurs. <lb/>Loan guarantee – Commitment by a third party to cover part of the losses related to a loan default. It can be provided by the <lb/>government and/or or by a private business association. It is backed up by a fund acting as collateral. <lb/>Leasing – Rental of work-related equipment against a monthly fee. The entrepreneur resorting to leasing may or may not become <lb/>owner of the equipment at the end of the leasing period, depending on the terms of the contract. <lb/>Microcredit – Small-sized loans to borrowers who find it difficult to obtain credit from traditional banks. It consists in small <lb/>sums generally at higher interest rates than those available at traditional banks to reflect the riskier profile of the borrower. In <lb/>the EU, the microcredit threshold is set at EUR 25 000. <lb/>Overdrafts – Lines of credit by which lending institutions allow borrowers to withdraw beyond their deposits. They have typically <lb/>a ceiling that reflects the perception of risk that the banks ascribe to borrowers. A very expensive source of external finance, it <lb/>is nonetheless common among entrepreneurs. <lb/>Self-financing groups – Community-based systems in which members make deposits and lend to each other. They are not dependent <lb/>on external support from philanthropic or financial institutions and lend only up to the limit of the resources they own. <lb/>Trade credit – Lenders are not financial institutions but company suppliers, who let buyers pay invoices within an agreed delay <lb/>period (usually between 30 and 90 days). Entrepreneurs can therefore use part of the revenues to pay for the supply. It is com-<lb/>mon in retail. <lb/>FURTHER READING <lb/>Molenaar K.
