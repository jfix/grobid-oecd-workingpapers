			<head>.............................................................. 33<lb/> OVERVIEW AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Access to financing is vital to promote entrepreneurship and SME development, and build a<lb/> competitive, innovative and sustainable tourism sector. Like all businesses, tourism SMEs have different<lb/> financing needs and face different challenges at each stage of the business lifecycle. A wide range of<lb/> private and public financing instruments are available to create, operate and expand the business, and<lb/> remain competitive. However, access to finance remains an issue in the sector.<lb/> This report examines mechanisms to improve access to finance for tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs<lb/> at each stage of the business lifecycle, with a particular emphasis on small and micro-enterprises. It<lb/> analyses the issues and barriers tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs face when accessing finance and reviews<lb/> the associated credit conditions. Financing mechanisms and strategies to support enterprise and tourism<lb/> development are identified, and country experiences and good practices highlighted. These may serve as<lb/> learning models which can be adapted to different situations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aligning finance demand and supply throughout the business lifecycle of tourism SMEs<lb/></head>

			<p>The ability of tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs to access the financing required at each stage of the<lb/> lifecycle, and the attached financing conditions, depends on the interaction of demand and supply factors.<lb/> Many of the challenges tourism SMEs face relate to the small scale of the business operation and are not<lb/> unique to tourism. These can be solved by sector-neutral SME programmes and measures to improve the<lb/> wider financing environment. However, tourism has a number of characteristics which in combination are<lb/> likely to have implications for the type of financing approaches needed and used in the sector (e.g.<lb/> production of service-based intangibles, participation in global markets, high number of lifestyle<lb/> entrepreneurs and family-run businesses, seasonal business cycle). Identifying whether specific policies<lb/> and programmes targeting tourism SMEs are required to address this is a fundamental policy question.<lb/></p>

			<p>The evidence gathered indicates that tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs face more stringent credit<lb/> conditions than the average SME, which in turn already face tighter conditions than firms of larger size.<lb/> This is not necessarily a market failure, but rather a rational response from the market derived from the<lb/> perception of tourism firms as more risky than other firms, and lack of collateral required to guarantee the<lb/> finance need. This is particularly a challenge for providers of intangible services, especially if the market<lb/> cannot adequately price the service provision.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report identifies certain market failures and circumstances in which government intervention in<lb/> the financing of tourism may be warranted.<lb/> This includes providing public supports at the start of the life cycle (concept, early state and start-up<lb/> phase), to enable innovative firms to appropriate the returns of the innovation and to foster<lb/> entrepreneurship. Country evidence indicates that the most common public financing instrument here is<lb/> grant support for innovative ideas, while subsidised loans are also used (e.g. France, Portugal, Slovenia).<lb/> Similar supports are more generally available for research and development in other OECD countries.<lb/> Incubators or accelerators often connect the public, private and academic sectors to create synergies and<lb/> facilitate the creation, diffusion and uptake of innovation. They also help to connect innovators with<lb/> private financing sources and public financing institutions offering loans at better conditions than those<lb/> found on the market.<lb/> Public intervention is less warranted for existing firms in the development phase (maturity,<lb/> standardisation), when the firm is already economically viable, at the risk of crowding out the private<lb/> sector. However, such interventions are observed in the case of tourism firms and are provided for reasons<lb/> other than financial viability. Countries have introduced measures to stimulate regional development,<lb/> support SME integration into value chains, promote inclusive entrepreneurship for women and under-<lb/>represented groups, encourage green business practices and support businesses to adapt to the digitalisation<lb/> of the tourism economy.<lb/> Public policies also seek to ameliorate the underlying conditions for businesses to survive and<lb/> prosper, including regulatory changes that favour the uptake of new instruments (e.g. crowdfunding in<lb/> New Zealand), ease the regulatory burden for tourism businesses (e.g. one-stop shop for tourism financing<lb/> in Austria), or offer finance products that are not available on the market (e.g. loans to tourism SMEs on<lb/> Greek islands).<lb/> Broadening the range of financing instruments available to tourism SME alone is unlikely in itself to<lb/> bring success. Tourism SMEs often have insufficient financial knowledge, awareness of finance options<lb/> and skills to effectively manage their financing needs. This has implications for the uptake of available<lb/> financing instruments by these businesses, and the associated financing conditions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy considerations<lb/></head>

			<p>The following policy considerations are identified to support the financing of tourism SMEs and<lb/> entrepreneurs:<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· Encourage greater uptake of sector-neutral SME financing options by tourism SMEs and<lb/> entrepreneurs, and support measures to improve the general business climate. Demand-side<lb/> issues</figure>

			<p>related to the small finance amounts required, insufficient collateral and a lack of financial<lb/> history, education and managerial skills are not unique to tourism SMEs. Policies targeting these<lb/> problems for the whole universe of SMEs will benefit tourism firms and entrepreneurs as well.<lb/> Policies to improve the underlying conditions will also benefit tourism SMEs, including<lb/> regulatory changes to promote the uptake of new instruments or ease the regulatory burden, or<lb/> incentives to encourage the private sector to offer finance products not available on the market.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· Ensure that tailored tourism initiatives, when provided, are well-targeted to address<lb/> specific tourism issues and complement (not duplicate) general SME supports.</figure>

			<p>Tourism<lb/> firms have at least three characteristics that may warrant specific policies: production of service-<lb/>based intangibles, participation of local firms in global value chains, and low barriers to entry.<lb/> Policy options include public credit registries or private credit bureaux to create a financial<lb/> history for tourism firms, and partial public guarantees as collateral substitutes for producers of<lb/> service-based intangibles. Honour-based loans such as those offered by Bpifrance to innovative<lb/> entrepreneurs can also help. Specific supports may be warranted for firms dealing with<lb/> international tourists or part of value chains. The issue of low-barriers to entry merits special<lb/> attention. Targeting supports to under-represented groups, including women, migrants, and ethnic<lb/> minorities, will help to promote more inclusive entrepreneurship and tourism growth.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· Target supports to innovative tourism SMEs, particularly in the early stages of the business<lb/> lifecycle. Public-sector intervention</figure>

			<p>in the finance of tourism-related activities is justified for<lb/> innovative entrepreneurs, where there is an identified market failure. This is the case where<lb/> innovators fail to innovate in the first place because the expected economic benefit is lower than<lb/> the cost. Public supports for financing innovative tourism entrepreneurs include grants and<lb/> subsidised loans. Incubators or accelerators can also foster entrepreneurship and facilitate the<lb/> creation, diffusion and uptake of innovation. Direct public intervention is less justified for firms<lb/> at the development stage of the lifecycle. Tailored supports for existing tourism SMEs in the<lb/> development stages should only be introduced where there is a clear financing or development<lb/> need. Interventions may be warranted in certain limited circumstances, such as to support local<lb/> and regional development and job creation, strengthen tourism value chains, targeting certain<lb/> population groupings, or encourage the uptake of new technologies and green business practices.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· Investigate the potential and promote the use of alternative financing instruments in tourism.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Alternative non-bank financing instruments such as crowdfunding hold potential for tourism SMEs<lb/> and entrepreneurs. These complementary mechanisms providing finance while having a local<lb/> development objective. Several crowdfunding initiatives targeting tourismâ€“related projects exist<lb/> (e.g. New Zealand, TravelStarter). The most extended use of crowdfunding is non-financial<lb/> crowdfunding, which is well-suited to tourism. This model is based on donations and rewards,<lb/> where the funder finances projects in exchange for a product (e.g. a hotel night, a free city tour).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· Strengthen the capacity of tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs to better access and use<lb/> financing instruments. Finance options should include non-financial supports to help tourism<lb/></figure>

			<p>SMEs maximise the benefit from available financing opportunities. This includes strengthening<lb/> financial planning and management skills, raising knowledge of available financing initiatives,<lb/> and creating tools to make it easier to access financing. The issue of capacity needs to be<lb/> addressed at the same time, if not before, the issue of finance, otherwise the financing problems<lb/> of the firm can be aggravated. Policy initiatives to encourage the financial sector to be more<lb/> proactive in providing financing to tourism SMEs could also be envisaged, including taking steps<lb/> to improve knowledge and understanding of the tourism sector.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· Improve data and build the evidence to accurately diagnose the demand and supply-side<lb/> barriers to financing for tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs, and inform the development of<lb/> appropriate policy responses.</figure>

			<p>Limited data is available on the financing conditions facing<lb/> tourism SMEs, and small and micro-enterprises in particular, and the appropriateness and uptake<lb/> of available financing instruments. Such data as is available tends to be for SMEs in general.<lb/></p>

			<head>PART I: PROMOTING SME AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FINANCING FOR TOURISM<lb/></head>

			<p>Entrepreneurship and SME development are essential to building a strong and sustainable tourism<lb/> sector. SMEs are the backbone of the tourism sector and many small and micro-enterprises offering<lb/> tourism services co-exist with larger companies. Tourism enterprises need adequate financing to create,<lb/> operate and expand the business, and remain competitive. The high number of small and micro-enterprises,<lb/> many of which are owner-operated, family-run, and female-owned, combined with the level of<lb/> fragmentation, lack of collateral, and the nature of tourism, has implications for the financing of enterprise<lb/> and tourism development.<lb/></p>

			<p>An effective financial system should serve the needs of all viable enterprises and enable them to<lb/> invest, grow and contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth (OECD, 2015b). Many of the challenges<lb/> tourism SMEs face when it comes to accessing adequate financing relate to the small scale of the business<lb/> operations. These are similar to the challenges faced by SMEs in other sectors, and can be solved by<lb/> sector-neutral SME programmes and wider policy measures to improve access to financing.<lb/> However, tourism also has a number of characteristics which in combination are likely to have<lb/> implications for the type of financing approaches needed and used in the sector. Identifying whether<lb/> specific policies and programmes targeting tourism SMEs are required to address these is thus a<lb/> fundamental policy question.<lb/></p>

			<p>In spite of the key role of SMEs in tourism and the importance of financing to the growth and<lb/> development of enterprises and the sector as a whole, information on the financing needs, barriers and<lb/> conditions faced by tourism SMEs, and the different financing mechanisms which can support tourism<lb/> entrepreneurship, is limited and, when available, often refers to the sub-sector of accommodation<lb/> businesses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financing profile of tourism SMEs â€“ the demand-side<lb/></head>

			<p>Tourism enterprises act at the local level, but operate in a global market place. This fact poses both<lb/> opportunities and challenges. Many small firms struggle to be part of wider value chains. Tourism is a<lb/> sector where the consumer comes to the place of the producer, offering the unique possibility each tourism<lb/> firm to be part of the global system. This is derived from the opportunity to export a good or service at the<lb/> point of sale, be a source of external currency, and act as the visible face of the country to the international<lb/> visitor. This characteristic makes tourism SMEs part of the global economy and provides a rationale for<lb/> public support.<lb/> However, changing consumer preferences and trends in the global competitive environment (e.g.<lb/> demand for unique, high quality tourism experiences), along with the macroeconomic context (e.g.<lb/> exchange rate fluctuations) and external events and developments, are impacting business performance and<lb/> demand for tourism services. Rising international competition is forcing enterprises to look at innovative<lb/> ways of improving the quality and market orientation of their products, their profitability and<lb/> competitiveness.<lb/> Technological developments and digitalisation are impacting business models and the wider tourism<lb/> economy. This creates the need to invest in new technologies to improve competitiveness (e.g. online<lb/> distribution platforms, ICT-innovation, digital global value chains). These trends and developments create<lb/> new challenges and have implications for the financial needs of the sector and the financial capacity of<lb/> tourism SMEs, including the financial management skills and capital needed to develop a competitive and<lb/> sustainable business offer.<lb/> Access to finance depends on how attractive tourism SMEs look to investors and financial<lb/> institutions. The capacity of tourism SMEs to plan and manage their financing needs and develop a robust<lb/> business proposal, and knowledge of available financing options, is an issue. Strategic business planning is<lb/> essential to put in place the structures to respond to the financing needs of the business and assure the<lb/> viability of the business in an increasingly complex tourism environment.<lb/> All businesses need access to sufficient financing to grow. Even where SMEs may not wish to invest,<lb/> expand and grow their business, enterprises still need financing to support their day-to-day operation and<lb/> to maintain their market position. This may be the case for lifestyle entrepreneurs and small, family-owned<lb/> businesses, for example, whose main purpose may be to secure a stable income stream rather than be at the<lb/> forefront of service innovation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The profile of tourism entrepreneurs has implications for the type of financing approaches needed and<lb/> used, because tourism is a sector with low barriers to entry and tourism offers a wide range of enterprise<lb/> creation and development opportunities. Tourism SMEs are also more likely to be managed by lifestyle<lb/> entrepreneurs, women, young people and people with a migrant background, or based on a co-operative<lb/> model than the average SME. Businesses operated by these under-represented groups face bigger<lb/> challenges in accessing external financing, and business proposals may not be well-founded or<lb/> commercially robust. Financing lifestyle entrepreneurs and other newcomers to the sector can pose<lb/> challenges, as their understanding of the sector may be limited and their financial management knowledge<lb/> and skills may vary.<lb/> Previous OECD (2015c) work has highlighted the need to improve financial literacy and management<lb/> skills in the sector. This is particularly an issue in small owner-operated or family-run businesses. There<lb/> remains the issue of the cost of such a public good provision. An ex-ante assessment is needed to verify<lb/> that the provision of financial education to tourism firms is welfare improving, compared to other<lb/> alternatives.<lb/> Tourism is also a highly fragmented sector, composed of different branches with differing finance<lb/> needs and skills (e.g. hotels, restaurants, tour operators, travel agencies). The aggregation of tourism SMEs<lb/> into a single group dilutes the individual characteristics and profiles of firms within the sector, and fails to<lb/> acknowledge the differing financing approaches best suited to their needs. This is also the case with SMEs<lb/> in general. For example, leasing and other asset-based financing is suitable for SMEs with mobile assets,<lb/> while technology-based SMEs focused on innovation and market disruption attract business angels in the<lb/> early stages.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tourism businesses involved in the production of service-based intangibles may find accessing<lb/> external financing particularly challenging, due to a lack of collateral and difficulties valuing the service<lb/> provided. The lack of collateral is also an issue for technology-based entrepreneurs, but the problem is<lb/> deepened if the market cannot adequately price service provision, which can frequently be the case in<lb/> tourism.<lb/></p>

			<p>SMEs in general rely on debt finance, but face practical difficulties when it comes to accessing<lb/> external financing, including the lack of appropriate financing mechanisms and collateral restrictions<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006</ref>). This is true also for tourism SMEs. When they do successfully access external financing,<lb/> SMEs tend to face higher costs (e.g. interest rates) and more severe credit conditions (e.g. higher collateral<lb/> requirements and shorter maturities), related to the riskier nature of the business. This, however, reinforces<lb/> the risk of financial distress and bankruptcy.<lb/> Some tourism activities are very dependent on capital to create and maintain a high quality,<lb/> competitive tourism infrastructure and product offering. Capital intensity is particularly an issue for hotels<lb/> and other accommodation establishments, where there is a recurring need for investment to update, refresh<lb/> and modernise the tourism offer. These businesses face challenges accessing finance for these working<lb/> capital needs, because available collateral might already be compromised securing other loans. Also, the<lb/> proposed renovations might not ensure a sufficiently higher stream of income revenues for the hotel.<lb/> Shortage of capital is a major obstacle to the development of the business proposal, affecting jobs and<lb/> skills development, market access, digital information and distribution and higher quality standards. This is<lb/> a challenge for tourism SMEs that have a weak capital base. Nevertheless, the case studies show that hotels<lb/> and other accommodation establishments are the sub-sector that faces a lower number of challenges in<lb/> accessing debt and collateral-based finance, compared to other tourism-related subsectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tourism is commonly perceived as relatively risky, compared with other sectors. The business cycle<lb/> and seasonal nature of tourism increases the risk profile of businesses in the sector. It creates cash flow and<lb/> other financing challenges linked with the short operating period in which to generate revenues, low<lb/> occupancy rates and under-utilised capacity. This fact impacts the balance sheet of tourism businesses, and<lb/> creates difficulties when it comes to presenting a comprehensive business and financial plan. Sustaining a<lb/> business through off-peak periods can be challenging and underscores the need to access capital at<lb/> reasonable rates and in a timely manner. Finance is more readily available to businesses where risks are<lb/> low and assets have recognised market values.<lb/> Collateral requirements impact the ability of tourism SMEs to obtain debt-financing. This is a major<lb/> obstacle for service providers with few fixed or tangible assets, such as travel agencies and tour operators,<lb/> but is also an issue for hotels and other accommodation establishments. Banks generally look at real-estate<lb/> based collateral when assessing financing applications, rather than cash flows and the profit generating<lb/> capability of the business from delivering tourism services. This feature can result in significant under<lb/> valuation of the business. The focus on real-estate based collateral is also a challenge if the property is<lb/> already pledged to secure a loan, due to the low equity ratios in the sector. Service-based tourism SMEs<lb/> face difficulties in assessing the market-value of their intangibles, limiting their potential use as collateral.<lb/></p>

			<p>The small scale of tourism businesses, many of which are micro-enterprises, also means that these<lb/> firms are in a weaker bargaining position vis-Ã -vis banks and other financial institutions when it comes to<lb/> negotiating financing conditions. It means that it may not be attractive or profitable for banks to cater to the<lb/> financing needs of tourism businesses, due to the small scale of the loans. If a market for small loans does<lb/> not exist, there might be a rationale for public intervention offering a product that is not provided by the<lb/> private sector, but charging the interest rates and fees that correspond to the implied risk. The idea is to<lb/> solve for the access to finance problem, not to provide subsidies.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarises the characteristics of tourism businesses which influence their ability to access<lb/> financing, some of which are shared with the broader SME sector).<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 1. Characteristics of tourism firms influencing ability to access finance<lb/> Type<lb/> Characteristic<lb/> Financial<lb/> Weak capital base<lb/> High risk<lb/> Lack of collateral<lb/> Small size â€“ highly fragmented<lb/> Human capital<lb/> Lack of skills, including financial education and management skills<lb/> Accessing finance to support tourism growth â€“ the supply side<lb/></table>

			<p>Access to financing is vital to promote entrepreneurship and SME development and build a<lb/> competitive and sustainable tourism sector. Financing is necessary at the early stages of an idea/product<lb/> development to encourage entrepreneurs to set up new businesses, and bring in innovation in the sector. It<lb/> is also necessary to support the survival and growth of existing tourism businesses.<lb/></p>

			<p>The finance needs of enterprises vary along the business lifecycle. Start-up companies face challenges<lb/> related to the lack of experience and established business record, and unproven business model. New<lb/> businesses may not be eligible or qualify for some bank financing instruments, or may face higher<lb/> financing costs or collateral requirements. Innovative SMEs experience difficulties accessing seed capital<lb/> and financing as they present a higher risk to banks. At the other end of the business lifecycle,<lb/> entrepreneurs encounter difficulties realising the value of a business in the event of sale, liquidation or<lb/> transfer.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the main finance instruments along the lifecycle of a typical firm, which can be<lb/> broadly composed of the following phases: early (from production concept, business start-up to actual start<lb/> of operations), expansion (including the stages of scaling up and standardisation of production), maturity,<lb/> and possibly, decline.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Finance needs along the life of a tourism firm<lb/> Source: Authors construction, adapted from several sources, including OECD (2012).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The capacity of tourism SMEs to innovate is affected by lack of finance. Innovative businesses and<lb/> start-ups face particular financing challenges, while business models in the sector are also evolving. SMEs<lb/> are often at the forefront in applying new technologies, developing new business models (OECD, 2015a)<lb/> and responding to market developments, and make important contributions to innovation, productivity and<lb/> value creation (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006</ref>).<lb/> The ability to innovate is critical to better participate in tourism value chains, which in turn may help<lb/> to create economies of scale, minimise operational costs and support economic growth. However, lack of<lb/> adequate and stable financial resources limits innovation in the sector, including investment in new<lb/> technologies, tools and software, and hampers firms from introducing the necessary innovation to ensure,<lb/> strengthen or upgrade their position in the chain (OECD, 2008a). SMEs in particular are often unable to<lb/> utilise the maximum potential of global value chains (OECD, 2008b).<lb/> A wide range of finance instruments are available to tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs among the<lb/> finance instruments available to all SMEs. The instruments can be classified by source of funds -public or<lb/> private -and by stage of the life of the firm -innovation or development phase (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Tourism firms<lb/> are observed to rely more on debt finance (e.g. standard bank loans, asset-based finance) than on equity<lb/> finance (e.g. equity stakes on the firm, venture capital).<lb/></p>

			<head>Financing innovation and new tourism entrepreneurs<lb/></head>

			<p>At the early stages of an innovation, idea or product development process, the firm is not yet<lb/> economically viable or profitable. This corresponds to the loss zone in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Apart from own capital<lb/> from the entrepreneur, this phase is usually financed with funds from friends and family who based on<lb/> private information decide whether or not to invest in the idea/project. This can include knowledge or<lb/> information on the skills or intrinsic characteristics of the entrepreneur, such as being hard working,<lb/> responsible, and other attributes that are not yet perceived by the market but are observed by potential<lb/> investors in the social network of the entrepreneur.<lb/> Depending on the characteristics of the idea or product innovation and the ecosystem on which it is<lb/> developed, business angels can provide finance at the early stage. There is also the potential for<lb/> crowdfunding, monetising the existing social capital (<ref type="biblio">Agrawal, Catalini, and Goldfarb, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Crowdfunding is a borrowing modality where several lenders finance a project, usually featured through<lb/> the internet. Public policies usually intervene at this stage through subsidies offering credit loans at better<lb/> terms than the market, with better rates and longer maturities. Such policies help the innovator to capture<lb/> the benefits of the innovation. OECD work on business research and innovation shows that the public<lb/> sector plays an essential role in the early stage of a firm, usually through financial incentives, including<lb/> grants, subsidies or tax incentives that allow the innovator to appropriate the value of the new idea, project<lb/> or process (OECD, 2011).<lb/> Public sector intervention is often most necessary at the start of the lifecycle of an innovative firm<lb/> (concept, early-state and start-up). Countries have introduced initiatives to promote innovation and<lb/> entrepreneurship in order to develop a high quality, sustainable tourism offer that meets visitor<lb/> expectations, generates domestic value added and supports economic and regional development. Public<lb/> intervention also seeks to enable the conditions to foster entrepreneurship, through incubators or<lb/> accelerators, which connect the public, private and academic sector, creating synergies that facilitate the<lb/> creation, diffusion, and uptake of innovation. These accelerators also connect innovators with the private<lb/> sector (business angles and venture capitalists) and with public banks that offer loans at better conditions<lb/> than those found on the market (subsidised interest rates, delayed payment of principal, honour loans<lb/> without collateral and longer terms).<lb/> Public support enables innovative firms to appropriate the returns of the innovation. With different<lb/> implementation characteristics, subsidies, including interest rate subsidies, grants, or tax incentives, are<lb/> allocated to targeted projects within tourism that bring innovation to the sector. The public support can be<lb/> allocated ex ante or ex post, if access to finance does not prevent the realisation of the project. Whenever<lb/> the tourism firm is viable, there is no reason for public intervention in the market, unless to correct for an<lb/> inefficiency. What is observed in this case is partial public support in the form of credit guarantees that<lb/> compensate for a lack of collateral on the part of the entrepreneur.<lb/> Non-financial support to new entrepreneurs comes in the form of easing the underlying conditions for<lb/> new businesses to thrive. Non-financial support means improving the regulatory environment for<lb/> businesses, favouring the creation of social capital through entrepreneurial networks, workshops, and<lb/> vetting on new ideas that signal to external founders on the validity of the new process or product.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financing the development of existing tourism firms<lb/></head>

			<p>During the development stages of the firm (scaling up, product or process standardisation) the firm is<lb/> already economically viable. The firm can access credit loans, crowdfunding opportunities, venture capital<lb/> firms, or private equity to finance day-to-day needs, renovation and expansion.<lb/> Small businesses largely rely on internal and informal sources of financing, such as personal loans,<lb/> overdraft facilities, credit card use, savings and working capital, when funding day-to-day operations.<lb/> Retained earnings are difficult to build up for SMEs as most earnings are immediately reinvested. The<lb/> OECD has mapped the external finance options available for SMEs, according to a risk/return profile. On<lb/> the lower end of the spectrum (low risk/low return) there is debt finance (credit loans) and asset-based<lb/> financing.<lb/> Short-term bank loans are well suited for financing marketing activities, new software and<lb/> technologies, or refreshing the product. Medium-and long-term bank loans are more appropriate for larger<lb/> investment projects, including renovating or developing new facilities. Overdraft facilities are an important<lb/> but expensive tool used by seasonal businesses to manage cash flow, particularly at the start of the season.<lb/> Personal guarantees can increase financial risk for individual business owners.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firms that rely on certain assets for their business operations (e.g. bicycles for city-tours, or kitchen<lb/> furniture for those firms in the food services) can borrow using the modality of asset-based finance. The<lb/> rationale is similar: the asset is used as collateral for the loan. However, asset-based finance is not suitable<lb/> for tourism firms producing service-based intangibles. Financing from sale of assets tends to be used by<lb/> medium and larger enterprises, where entrepreneurs own land/buildings not needed for day-to-day<lb/> operations, and may be of limited use in the tourism sector. Leasing is form of asset-based finance<lb/> frequently used for furniture, kitchen or similar equipment, vehicles and technology.<lb/> Value chain finance refers to the fact that some suppliers (e.g. the firm supplying fruits and vegetables<lb/> to a hotel, or service suppliers) can benefit from the financial history of larger firms in the value chain and<lb/> therefore access to finance instruments that help improve their competitiveness and the competitiveness of<lb/> the whole value chain that otherwise would be unavailable (mainly because of scale problems).<lb/> Non-debt financing from private capital markets is a further source of external financing, towards the<lb/> right-end of the risk/return spectrum. Venture, risk and mezzanine capital financing is suitable for business<lb/> start-ups and expansion, and innovative projects in the tourism sector benefit from equity-based<lb/> instruments. Venture capital is important for untested business models with no track record; it replaces or<lb/> complements traditional bank finance (OECD, 2013). Mezzanine finance is a generic term for finance<lb/> instruments composed of debt and equity (hybrid) with different degrees of risk/return. However, this type<lb/> of financing is reported to be less used by tourism SMEs, in part due to the lack of awareness of this<lb/> financing option, large minimum investment amounts involved and the potential absence of an institutional<lb/> framework to support this type of financing in tourism.<lb/> Direct public intervention is less justified in the development phase, at the risk of crowding out the<lb/> private sector, by offering better terms and conditions which may destroy incentives for the private sector<lb/> the enter the market. However, public intervention is observed in the case of tourism firms. The<lb/> intervention is justified on the rationale that there is a local or regional development dimension and that<lb/> support is needed because of the direct effects on the firm (e.g. increased competitiveness through the<lb/> uptake of ICT tools), the indirect benefits that the firm brings (e.g. job creation, inclusion), including<lb/> environmental (e.g. supporting green investments or renovations) or social benefits, beyond economic<lb/> viability. Public intervention is done through ensuring the underlying conditions for businesses to survive<lb/> and prosper, providing indirect financial instruments (e.g. credit guarantees) that solve for specific issues,<lb/> such as lack of collateral or lack of credit history, or direct instruments that target the specific objectives<lb/> (e.g. inclusive entrepreneurship or public good provision).<lb/></p>

			<head>Financing regional development and inclusive entrepreneurship<lb/></head>

			<p>The functions of public financing institutions and development banks include the efficient allocation<lb/> of credit and supply of products not covered by the market, to provide economic or financial additionality.<lb/> Financing regional development and under-represented groups fall under these latter categories.<lb/> Transaction costs are generally higher for tourism firms in isolated geographical regions, and for<lb/> businesses created and managed by women, migrants, and ethnic minorities, due to cultural reasons. These<lb/> sections of the population are more likely to enter the tourism business, compared to the overall spectrum<lb/> of SMEs.<lb/> However, public developments banks tend to provide credit for medium-long term projects and<lb/> sometimes neglect to lend to tourism firms headed by under-represented groups. When this is the case, it<lb/> has been observed that microfinance institutions step in. These institutions are usually private providers<lb/> organised as non-governmental organisations. They provide credit and other financial services to groups<lb/> that otherwise would not be able to access finance, or only at very unfavourable terms, because of a lack of<lb/> property rights, collateral or credit history, unobserved quality, and very small desired amounts to borrow.<lb/> Microfinance institutions use group-lending schemes (usually based on joint group liability) to resolve<lb/> the issue of adverse selection and moral hazard. That is, by requiring the group to be self-formed,<lb/> participants select other members with desirable characteristics â€“ hard working, with a known informal<lb/> repayment history -and exert control on the behaviour of the group. By transferring these activities to the<lb/> group itself, microfinance institutions can overcome at least part of the screening and monitoring costs, and<lb/> the group forms a sort of &quot; collateral of peer-pressure &quot; to repay.<lb/> The experience with microfinance has shown that it tends to be a transitional institution, which helps<lb/> members graduate to standard and formal credit institutions. Microfinance members tend to have low<lb/> productivity, and there is evidence to show these individuals would be better off as employees in a higher<lb/> productivity firm (RED, 2013). Moreover, these under-represented groups usually have other problems that<lb/> are not solved by credit provision. Microfinance is a powerful tool, but it needs to be complemented with<lb/> other poverty and development policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-financial dimensions of tourism SME financing<lb/></head>

			<p>The extent to which the financial sector understands and caters to the needs of tourism businesses is<lb/> an issue. Insufficient knowledge or understanding of the sector and the financing needs of tourism SMEs<lb/> on the part of lenders and investors is a challenge. Investors and lenders may lack the knowledge and<lb/> experience to accurately assess the risk and cost of financial instruments. The risk perception of tourism<lb/> SMEs may be higher as a result, particularly for more innovative or less conventional financing requests,<lb/> or in areas where tourism is less developed. This may lead to more stringent financing conditions or even<lb/> reluctance to finance day-to-day or investment activities, as reported by industry. It can also affect the time<lb/> it takes to assess and approve financing support.<lb/> Investors and lenders may lack the flexibility to adjust the terms and conditions to better meet the<lb/> needs of sector. Flexible products with variable repayment options, which permit tourism SMEs to repay<lb/> the loan capital plus interest during the season with an interest-only option during the off-season, for<lb/> example, would take account of the seasonal fluctuations and financing constraints faced by tourism<lb/> SMEs. Such an approach does not require dedicated financing products catering specifically to tourism<lb/> SMEs, but rather flexible products which can take account of the specific financing needs and cash flow<lb/> challenges encountered by businesses in the tourism sector.<lb/> Regional or local banks potentially have a better knowledge and understanding of tourism SME<lb/> financing needs, particularly in regions where tourism is important. As such, these banks may be better<lb/> placed to respond to the financing needs of tourism SMEs, as they may be more flexible in adapting to<lb/> these needs and more experienced in assessing the risk and viability of tourism business proposals.<lb/> However, regional banks also experience problems in assessing the viability of the proposals, given the<lb/> lack of experience of lender in the tourism sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>The bureaucracy involved in accessing funding can be a further obstacle. Inflexible bank processes<lb/> and complicated and time-consuming procedures for obtaining financial resources from banks are<lb/> particularly challenging for micro-enterprises, which lack the advantages of scale of larger businesses.<lb/> Small and family owned businesses find it difficult to fulfil bank lending criteria, and may be discouraged<lb/> from applying for bank credit. Administrative procedures and delays also impact the timeliness of credit<lb/> decisions.<lb/> Wider developments in the general financial environment in which tourism business operate also have<lb/> repercussions. The global financial and economic crisis affected the business environment in many OECD<lb/> countries. This has exacerbated the financial constraints typically experienced by SMEs, impacting<lb/> demand for the goods and services they provide, along with cash flow, liquidity and working capital and<lb/> the availability of credit. Equity financing was also severely affected by the crisis. Revisions to the<lb/> international regulatory framework for banks (Basel III) following the financial crisis have resulted in<lb/> more restrictive bank lending policies and practices. Equity capital requirements and tougher repayment<lb/> terms, for example, affect project feasibility and make it more difficult to obtain loans.<lb/> While financing conditions have generally improved in recent years, access finance remains tight for<lb/> SMEs and entrepreneurs in many countries, especially where economic growth is weak. SMEs are<lb/> generally more vulnerable to changing credit market conditions and face more difficulty obtaining external<lb/> funding than larger firms. On the up side, the current low interest rate environment in many countries is<lb/> attractive for those companies that do manage to obtain finance (</p>

Non-financial supply-side factors impacting access to finance for tourism firms<lb/> Non-financial dimensions (supply side)<lb/> Insufficient knowledge of the sector<lb/> Lack of flexibility to enable seasonal payment schedules in a standard product<lb/> Burden of bureaucracy (regulations and permits)<lb/> Macroeconomic context<lb/></table>

			<head>Implications and financing conditions for tourism businesses, and the sector as a whole<lb/></head>

			<p>Whether tourism SMEs face stricter loan conditions compared with other service-based SMEs or<lb/> SMEs in general is not clearly apparent. There is some evidence to suggest that tourism SMEs and<lb/> entrepreneurs do face less favourable loan conditions than the average SME, which in turn already face<lb/> more stringent conditions than larger firms.<lb/> In some countries, tourism SMEs reportedly experience greater difficult getting loan approval and<lb/> face higher interest rates and collateral requirements, shorter repayment periods, linked with the higher risk<lb/> perception and affecting business viability. In other countries, tourism SMEs are reported to encounter the<lb/> same rejection rates, collateral requirements, interest rate levels, repayment terms and administrative costs<lb/> as other SMEs. In yet other cases, tourism SMEs are particular targets of development public policies and<lb/> confront better finance needs, in terms of interest rates, loan maturity and collateral requirements than the<lb/> average SME. This is the case, for example, with the Austrian Tourism Development Bank initiative and<lb/> the Greek island support to tourism enterprises (Austria and Greece case studies).<lb/> Debt financing in the form of commercial bank loans and overdraft facilities is reported to be the main<lb/> source of external financing for tourism SMEs. However, the tourism industry often reports difficulties in<lb/> obtaining bank loan approval and securing sufficient debt financing. It can be particularly difficult for new<lb/> businesses and micro-enterprises to get debt financing approval for seed loans and small-sized loans. The<lb/> industry also reports difficulties in getting long term (10+ years) loan approval to meet long term financing<lb/> needs due to insufficient equity and collateral and the inherent volatility of tourism. The high cost of<lb/> financing is also an issue, as are repayment terms and schedules (such as the mismatch between seasonal<lb/> income and uniform monthly repayments). This inherent higher risk is internalised by the market, as shown<lb/> by the experience of the Austrian Bank for Tourism Development, which states that tourism SMEs are<lb/> charged on average 100 basis points higher than non-tourism companies.<lb/> In Switzerland, 35% of restaurants and hotels in Switzerland had a bank loan and/or credit facility in<lb/> place in 2012, the same level as the average for all companies. However, Switzerland has diagnosed that an<lb/> investment bottleneck is impacting competitiveness, with a backlog of maintenance and replacement<lb/> investments due to the existence of a financing gap and restrictive bank lending policies (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/> Funding for the hospitality industry in Switzerland helps to close this identified financing gap for<lb/> viable companies with a healthy earning position. A range of publicly-supported financing instruments are<lb/> available to tourism SMEs, including low interest loans and consulting services to hotels through the Swiss<lb/> Society for Hotel Credit, interest-free loans for tourism infrastructure projects (e.g. cable cars, hotels) and<lb/> non-refundable grants for non-construction projects (e.g. market research, co-operation) through the<lb/> National Regional Programme, and credit guarantees for easy-to-obtain operating loans from co-operatives<lb/> for the hospitality industry. Financial support is also offered by several cantons (Box 1).<lb/></p>

Closing the financing gap in the hospitality industry in Switzerland<lb/> In Switzerland, public financing instruments include the Swiss Society for Hotel Credit, which targets hospitality<lb/> SMEs, and New Regional Policy and guarantee co-operatives, which support SMEs in general.<lb/> The Swiss Society for Hotel Credit (SGH)</figure>

			<p>provides low interest loans to hotels and private lenders and offers<lb/> consulting services. The financial assistance the SGH provides to the hospitality sector is economically important.<lb/> During the period 2007-12, investments part-financed by the SGH (CHF 139 million) in Alpine regions accounted for<lb/> around 28% of total investment. In 2015, the SGH revised its lending policy, giving it significantly more flexibility in<lb/> terms of financial assistance options. The geographical scope of activities was widened to support hotels in more<lb/> regions. SGH&apos;s financial scope was also increased. The individual loan volume increased from CHF 2 million to<lb/> CHF 6 million, with larger loans possible in exceptional circumstances. Loans normally account for up to 40% of net<lb/> value, calculated based on the discounted cash flow method. The expansion of SGH&apos;s loan volume from 2016-19<lb/> will be financed with an additional loan from the Swiss Confederation, ensuring SGH activities beyond 2019 can<lb/> continue at an adequate level without requiring additional funds. Impulse loans for new investments were added to<lb/> the financing portfolio in 2015, supplementing existing low interest start-up loans. Impulse loans aim to increase<lb/> productivity and cost efficiency, expand the season, strengthen the regional value added chain and improve energy<lb/> sustainability. SGH also provides consulting services to improve access to finance through new investment<lb/> evaluations, feasibility studies and creation of innovative business concepts. It also provides advice on investment-<lb/>related grants, empowers companies through knowledge transfer and provides co-operation related support for<lb/> companies in the tourism and hospitality sector. The Swiss Hospitality Investment Forum is a key knowledge and<lb/> contact platform in this regard.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The New Regional Policy (NRP) provides interest free loans for tourist infrastructure projects (e.g. cable car<lb/> and hotel structures) and non-returnable grants for non-construction projects (e.g. market research). This financing<lb/> is particularly important for financing tourism infrastructure. Since 2012, 36% of all projects, 22% of grants and 80%<lb/> of loans pertain to tourism. An information document aims to improve co-ordination, optimise impact and increase<lb/> transparency of grants and financial assistance provided by SGH and NRP to the hospitality sector.<lb/> Guarantee co-operatives make operating loans easy to obtain in the hospitality industry by issuing credit limit<lb/> guarantees, thereby enabling SMEs to obtain loans which banks would otherwise refuse. The guarantee volume<lb/> issue by guarantee co-operatives amounted to CHF 218 million by end 2012, with 14% of SMEs with guarantees<lb/> operating in the hospitality industry.<lb/> 75 %<lb/> 60 %<lb/> Investment costs<lb/> (incl. building land)<lb/> Net value *<lb/> ( 65-75% of<lb/> investment costs)<lb/> Financing<lb/> Not profitable<lb/> Financing gap**<lb/> Bank financing<lb/> ( 60 % of the return on<lb/> plan assumptions)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Research in <ref type="biblio">Canada (2011, 2015</ref>) indicates that personal financing, credit from financial institutions<lb/> and leasing are the three main sources of financing used by entrepreneurs wishing to start a tourism<lb/> business, which were significantly more likely to use the latter two compared with other SMEs. Tourism<lb/> SMEs were also significantly more likely to use government credit or grants. Tourism SMEs are less likely<lb/> to both request and be approved for external financing, compared with non-tourism SMEs. The analysis<lb/> reveals that tourism SMEs typically received smaller amounts of debt financing and faced more<lb/> unfavourable non-pricing loan conditions, compared with other SMEs (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Financing profile of tourism SMEs in Canada<lb/></head>

			<p>SMEs constitute the backbone of tourism in Canada, accounting for 99.9% of businesses in the tourism<lb/> industries, or 9% of the estimated 1.2 million SME employers in Canada in 2013. Debt financing is the most common<lb/> type of financing sought by both tourism and other SMEs, accounting for 66% of the total amount of external<lb/> financing authorised to SMEs in 2011. However, both groups experience more difficulty obtaining this type of<lb/> financing than other types of financing that are less risky. On average, in 2011, tourism SMEs had a perfect approval<lb/> rating for lease financing, trade credit and government financing, whereas only 86.1% of debt financing requests were<lb/> approved â€“ these approval rates are similar to those experienced by SMEs in other industries.<lb/> Tourism SMEs (16.3%) are more likely compared with other SMEs (5.3%) to use government institutions as a<lb/> provider of finance. They were also more likely to be approved for financing (99.9%) than other SMEs (81.8%).<lb/> Obtaining financing can be particularly difficult for tourism SMEs because financial institutions may view them as<lb/> relatively risky compared with other SMEs. Thus, tourism SMEs may turn to government institutions, to obtain<lb/> external financing or access loan guarantees.</p>

			<figure>For Fiscal Year 2013-14, the Business Development Bank of Canada)<lb/> had 3 353 tourism-related clients for an outstanding financing commitment of CAD 2.6 billion, or approximately 13%<lb/> of its total loan and guarantee portfolio. For Fiscal Year 2012-13, financial institutions registered Canada Small<lb/> Business Financing Programme loans worth CAD 300.3 million (33% of the total value loans) to 1 546 small<lb/> businesses in accommodation and food services, the largest user of the programme.<lb/> When a business is perceived as being more risky, it is not unusual for a lender to provide less favourable loan<lb/> terms and conditions. Terms and conditions were tight following the economic recession and financial institutions<lb/> managed risk by extending less financing to SMEs in general. However, terms and conditions improved for tourism<lb/> SMEs in 2011. Fewer tourism SMEs (45.3%) were required to pledge collateral in 2011 compared with other SMEs<lb/> (67.3%). In addition, SMEs in both tourism and other industries were offered lower interest rates. However, tourism<lb/> SMEs requested less financing, on average, and received less than what they requested in 2011.Tourism SMEs had<lb/> a lower total financing authorisation-to-request ratio (85.0%) than other SMEs (94.8%) in 2011, suggesting tourism<lb/> SMEs had more difficulty obtaining debt financing than other SMEs.<lb/> Source: Industry Canada (2015) www.ic.gc.ca<lb/></figure>

			<p>Failure to access adequate financing to support tourism SMEs has implications at both enterprise and<lb/> sector level. The main reported consequence of these financing challenges is the negative impact on quality<lb/> and competitiveness of the tourism offer. Financing the investment needed to maintain and improve facilities,<lb/> adapt to new standards and demands and develop the product and infrastructure is a recurrent challenge for<lb/> tourism businesses. Financial instability also impacts the ability of tourism businesses, and the sector as a<lb/> whole, to attract skilled human resources to develop and provide high value tourism services.<lb/> Financing constraints impact on business survival rates, and have implications for the growth and<lb/> development of enterprises. The heavy reliance on internal funding, and difficulties accessing adequate<lb/> external financing in a timely and cost-effective manner limits the growth potential of many tourism<lb/> businesses. Failure to deal with the financing issues facing the sector will limit the capacity of tourism<lb/> SMEs to contribute to economic and tourism growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Indeed, as economic growth remains weak, many OECD countries have been developing strategies to<lb/> strengthen SMEs and promote entrepreneurship, including improving SME financing (Box 3). Recent<lb/> OECD work has highlighted the pressing need to broaden the range of financial instruments available,<lb/> support the uptake of alternative financing instruments and improve financing conditions for SMEs and<lb/> entrepreneurs, to foster new sources of growth and enable SMEs to continue to play their role in<lb/> investment, growth, innovation and employment (OECD, 2015a).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. G20 OECD high level principles on SME financing<lb/> The principles are:<lb/> 1. Identify SME financing needs and gaps and improve the evidence base.<lb/> 2. Strengthen SME access to traditional bank financing.<lb/> 3. Enable SMEs to access diverse non-traditional financing instruments and channels.<lb/> 4.

			<p>Governments have responded to the tight financing conditions that tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs<lb/> face with a variety of different instruments to boost access to finance. The previous section has shown that<lb/> these financing conditions are due to demand and supply factors. Policy options to tackle these demand and<lb/> supply side challenges include: government supported loans, guarantees and grants; tax incentives;<lb/> subsidies and financing through national or regional programmes; changes to the regulatory/legal<lb/> framework; programmes to consolidate the financial structure of firms and support the use of non-debt<lb/> financing approaches; and the development of tools to promote awareness of the different financing and<lb/> other supports available (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>These measures carry varying levels of costs for public budgets, from negative cost (e.g. negative<lb/> interest rates for bank deposits at the central bank) or cost neutral (e.g. bank targets for SME lending) to<lb/> significant funding costs (e.g. government direct lending and loan guarantees) (OECD, 2015b).<lb/> It should be acknowledged that even where no financing initiatives specifically targeting tourism<lb/> SMEs exist, tourism policies and programmes play an important role in creating the framework conditions<lb/> to support investment and financing in tourism. This includes ensuring the infrastructure necessary for<lb/> tourism development is in place. Investors and lenders need to be confident the service and transport<lb/> infrastructure will be sufficient to support investment. In many countries public authorities are also actively<lb/> involved in and provide financing for marketing and promoting destinations, in contrast to other sectors of<lb/> the economy. Tourism SMEs benefit from these, and other, indirect financial supports (e.g. market<lb/> research and studies), even where other financing supports are not targeted at tourism SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Policy options to support tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs<lb/></figure>

			<head>Supporting existing tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs through sector neutral programmes<lb/></head>

			<p>Sector-neutral SME programmes to improve access to financing for SMEs implicitly recognise that<lb/> the finance needs of existing tourism firms are no different from those of other SMEs, once their business<lb/> is economically viable. Therefore, tourism SMEs can benefit from direct and/or indirect public supports to<lb/> improve access to financing for all SMEs and entrepreneurs.<lb/> Survey responses from many countries indicate this to be the case. Sector neutral approaches in these<lb/> countries seek to resolve the problems encountered by tourism SMEs linked with the lack of collateral or<lb/> track record by providing public guarantees (Denmark, Hungary, Norway), mezzanine finance (Germany),<lb/> guarantee co-operatives (Switzerland) or microcredits (Russian Federation). Other indirect actions include<lb/> changes to the legal/regulatory framework and supervisory measures to improve the overall functioning of<lb/> the financial system and create the best possible conditions for doing business (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).<lb/> In Denmark, the Danish Growth Fund offers a range of flexible products and instruments, which are<lb/> available to all SMEs to select and use according to the needs of individual businesses, regardless of sector.<lb/> These include subordinated growth loans and guarantees, which are primarily targeted at small and/or new<lb/> businesses. The lack of a track record has been identified as the most important challenge for SMEs in<lb/> Denmark when it comes to accessing finance, and provides a rationale for these measures. Therefore, the<lb/> indirect finance instrument of choice is the use of public guarantees to partially alleviate the problem.<lb/> Providing complete guarantees would distort the incentives for the firm to perform in a prudential and<lb/> viable manner.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the Danish Growth Fund operates on market terms for the most part, these subsidised products<lb/> enable the fund to take on greater risk. These instruments are available to tourism SMEs -a loan from the<lb/> Danish Growth Fund has enabled a small rural inn which could not obtain bank financing to renovate and<lb/> expand the business, for example. The Fund also makes direct equity investments in companies with a<lb/></p>

			<p>In Norway, the government agency promoting innovation and development of enterprises and<lb/> industry is also responsible for promoting tourism development in the country. Innovation Norway,<lb/> provides debt and non-debt financing instruments which are open to all SMEs, including start-up grants,<lb/> development funds and commercialisation grants, low risk loans and guarantees and tax incentives.<lb/> Innovation Norway is the most important public contributor when it comes to tourism financing â€“ in the<lb/> first half of 2015, Innovation Norway provided NOK 262 million in funding to tourism, including<lb/> NOK 56 million in low risk loans and NOK 168 million in development funds and grants to agritourism<lb/> businesses. Only a relatively low number of start-up grants have been given to tourism businesses.<lb/> In Switzerland, guarantee co-operatives make operating loans easy to obtain by issuing credit limit<lb/> guarantees, thereby enabling all SMEs to obtain loans which banks would otherwise refuse. Guarantee co-<lb/>operatives are private institutions operating on commercial basis. Four guarantee co-operatives operate in<lb/> Switzerland, three of which are active at regional level, while a fourth operates at the national level and<lb/> concentrates on female entrepreneurs. Guarantee co-operatives receive a small amount of public support in<lb/> the order of CHF 3 million per year, and can cover up to 65% of project losses. The guarantee volume<lb/> issue by guarantee co-operatives amounted to CHF 218 million by end 2012, of which CHF 26 million<lb/> were for hotel and restaurants small firms (about 14% of the whole volume lent).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development has implemented a microcredit<lb/> programme to alleviate finance needs of small businesses. The loans are up to RUB 3 million and with a<lb/> maturity of maximum 36 months. Although a general SME programme, it specifically addresses SMEs<lb/> operating in crafts, folk artistic crafts, rural and ecological tourism, providing mentoring, expertise, and<lb/> promotion in congress and exhibition events.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Netherlands, a structural bottleneck in the market of SME finance exists and a number of<lb/> temporary measures are available for existing SMEs. These measures aim to stimulate the market to<lb/> develop by providing up to EUR 155 million over the period 2014-19 in the form of subordinated loans<lb/> and risk capital, as well as targeting financing to innovative start-ups, supporting SMEs credit information;<lb/> improving knowledge, expertise and managerial capacity of SMEs, and supporting SME inclusion in value<lb/> chains. This support is available to SMEs in all sectors, including tourism.<lb/></p>

			<table>Tourism SMEs in Hungary similarly have access to SME financing programmes, including the<lb/> Funding for Growth Scheme operated by the Central Bank of Hungary and the SME Credit Card<lb/> Programme operated by KAVOSZ, a joint corporation of the National Association of Entrepreneurs and<lb/> Employers and the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, but no specific schemes exist for the<lb/> tourism sector.<lb/></table>

			<p>The European Union also provides sector-neutral supports to improve access to financing for SMEs,<lb/> including direct funding through grants or indirect funding via financial intermediaries to help SMEs to<lb/> start-up, expand and transfer their business. Funding is available to support the tourism sector from diverse<lb/> thematic EU funding programmes. To help tourism business to identify appropriate available financing<lb/> possibilities, the EU Guide on Funding for the Tourism Sector gathers information on the various sources<lb/> of EU funding of interest for the European tourism industry and its different actors, from both private and<lb/> public sector. It focuses on practical questions around the type of tourism-related actions eligible for<lb/> funding, type and level of funding, who can apply and how to apply. It also points to concrete examples of<lb/> what has been funded under previous programmes, as a possible source of inspiration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Developing targeted initiatives to develop smarter, greener and more inclusive tourism SMEs<lb/></head>

			<p>Other countries have introduced targeted measures to help tourism SMEs meet their financing needs.<lb/> This has been the case where options available are judged not to fully cater to the needs of tourism SMEs,<lb/> or support the achievement of wider tourism development and economic policy goals, including targeting<lb/> certain population groupings. These measures have been introduced to, for example, stimulate regional<lb/> development, support SME integration into value chains and promote inclusive entrepreneurship. Other<lb/> measures aim to encourage green business practices, support the use of new technologies and help<lb/> businesses to cope with structural change. In other cases, the private sector has led initiatives to support<lb/> tourism businesses in responding to specific opportunities and challenges. These tailored tourism initiative<lb/> operate alongside general SME financing initiatives available to tourism SMEs. Public policies also seek to<lb/> ameliorate the underlying conditions, including regulatory changes that favour the uptake of new<lb/> instruments or ease the regulatory burden, or offer finance products not available on the market.<lb/> In some cases, targeted tourism initiatives have been introduced to general SME financing<lb/> programmes, led by national enterprise agencies.<lb/> In Slovenia, for example, the Programme of Financial Incentives for the Economy includes a<lb/> dedicated tourism sub-action with the goal of stimulating tourism businesses to achieve the strategic<lb/> objectives of Slovene tourism. Financial resources are targeted at co-financing marketing and promotion<lb/> activities and ensuring a competitive business environment through, for example, co-financing research<lb/> and development and providing pre-finance for participation in European projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>These measures have sometimes been introduced to support regional development, help SMEs<lb/> integrate into wider value chains and achieve wider development objectives, as part of general financing<lb/> programmes.<lb/> In Greece, for example, the Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development&apos;s Entrepreneurship<lb/> Fund is the main financial engineering instrument to support SMEs. Two of the Fund&apos;s programmes<lb/> provide low cost working capital and investment loans and loan guarantees, and are available to SMEs in<lb/> general. A third programme, Island Tourism Entrepreneurship, provides low cost loans up to EUR 30 000<lb/> to small and micro tourism enterprises on Greek islands. This programme is exclusively available to<lb/> tourism businesses, which need working and investment capital to target new markets and modernise the<lb/> Greek tourism offering. The tourism sector has a low rate of participation in total bank financing, and data<lb/> from the Bank of Greece indicates that production capacity in the tourism industry is deteriorating, as new<lb/> investments in fixed tourism assets are lower than the depreciation of existing assets.<lb/></p>

			<p>In creating this loan product, the Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development had to take<lb/> into account the difficult financial condition and capital controls facing the Greek banking system. The<lb/> banks play an important role in processing applications and disbursing the loans, but lack the capital to co-<lb/>finance the Island Tourism Entrepreneurship programme. Instead, each approved island SME co-invests<lb/> 30% of the total business proposal cost. The Fund recognises the importance of the tourism value chain in<lb/> local island economies and has plans to launch further measures (loan, guarantee and micro-credit funds)<lb/> to promote growth and sustainability in the tourism sector (Greece case study).<lb/> In other countries, publicly funded financial institutions and developments banks have been tasked<lb/> with supporting tourism businesses as part of their wider activities.<lb/> In Mexico, the rural development bank loans at competitive rates to tourism firms to strengthen the<lb/> value chain, where lack of expertise is a particular challenge for these rural firms. Moreover, the small<lb/> loans offered by National Financial Institute for Agriculture, Rural, Forestry and Fisheries Development to<lb/> support regional development are based on cash-flow analysis, not on guarantees or physical collateral.<lb/></p>

			<figure>From 2009 to 2014, the bank granted USD 26.7 million in credits to the development of rural tourism in<lb/> Mexico. In 2013-14, 71% of the total disbursements have been directed to this sector. Direct lending<lb/> accounts for 65% of the resources, with the rest channelled through financial intermediaries. The strategy<lb/> has shown high repayment rates and an average loan of USD 40 565. These results signal that the target<lb/> populations receive loans that are in accordance to their financial capacity and that loans are used to<lb/> finance short-term operational needs. Likewise, Bpifrance provides honour loans to new entrepreneurs in<lb/> France (France case study).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Croatia, the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development has three targeted loan<lb/> programmes to support the tourism industry and help businesses prepare for the upcoming season and cater<lb/> to the international visitor market. Tourism businesses can also benefit from measures to promote<lb/> investment, credit guarantees, grant schemes and co-financing consultancy services offered by the Croatian<lb/> Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments. The Ministry of Tourism also provides grants to SMEs to<lb/> improve boost competitiveness of the tourism offer through the allocation of grants to small and rural<lb/> enterprises.<lb/> In Austria, a dedicated one-stop shop for all tourism financing-related issues exists. The Austrian<lb/> Tourism Development Bank (OEHT) is public-private partnership with a long history and experience in<lb/> the tourism sector. Programmes are based on direct and indirect financing and risk sharing and include<lb/> initiatives to stimulate private financing participation. Depending on the instrument, entrepreneurs may be<lb/> required to make an equity contribution. The Bank&apos;s instruments can be combined with commercial<lb/> financing options which may not fully cater to the needs of tourism SMEs. Special programmes also target<lb/> the needs of tourism start-ups and boost business innovation. The OEHT has been effective in broadening<lb/> the range of financing instruments available to tourism businesses in Austria. However these remain<lb/> largely conservative and are mainly taken up by firms in the hotel and accommodation subsector (Austria<lb/> case study).<lb/> In New Zealand, public support to tourism firms is provided over two main tracks: one track supports<lb/> the provision of innovative products, process or goods, while the other targets family-owned enterprises to<lb/> support regional development. Supporting local development is a strategy that contributes to reducing<lb/> inequality and generates more inclusive growth. The Tourism Growth Partnership (TGP) is a government<lb/> initiative to help the tourism sector achieve greater commercial and wider returns from high value<lb/> international visitors. It provides strategic, targeted funding for internationally focused projects that align<lb/> with wider government tourism priorities, including increasing innovation and productivity in tourism. The<lb/> Partnership co-invests up to 50% of funding for approved projects. It has an annual budget of<lb/> NZD 8 million and has realised 21 projects totally NZD 10.9 million in investment to date.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are also examples of co-operative approaches improving access to finance for tourism<lb/> businesses, outside the formal structures of publicly funded financial institutions and developments banks.<lb/> In Switzerland, a co-operative approach to financing the construction of a private youth hostel in<lb/> conjunction with the refurbishment and operation of a public spa facility in the Alpine destination of Saas<lb/> Fee. Individually the business proposals were highly desirable, but not financially viable. By coming<lb/> together to find a common solution â€“ permitting the construction of the youth hostel on top of the existing<lb/> leisure centre premises, with a commitment from the hostel operator to operate the leisure centre at their<lb/> own risk -the public and private actors strengthened the viability of the business proposal and meant both<lb/> facilities benefits from economies of scale (Switzerland case study).<lb/> Some countries have also introduced programmes to promote and finance inclusive entrepreneurship.<lb/> In Canada, programmes are in place to finance tourism SMEs that are led by women, migrants and<lb/> ethnic groups, or other minorities. The programmes recognise that these groups face bigger challenges in<lb/> accessing external finance options, and see that entrepreneurship is an alternative to unemployment. Public<lb/> financial support offered by the Federal government in co-ordination with sub-national governments and<lb/> the private sector also aims to promote regional tourism development, including the integration of SMEs in<lb/> the tourism value chain (Box 4).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Financing tourism to support regional development in Canada<lb/></head>

			<p>In Canada, financial support for the tourism sector is provided in partnership with other levels of government,<lb/> with Aboriginal communities, and other private actors. In 2008-09, federal direct support for the tourism sector<lb/> amounted to CAD 530 million for product development and tourism infrastructure such as convention centres, and<lb/> CAD 113 million for tourism marketing. Furthermore, CAD 782 million was spent on artistic, cultural and sports-<lb/>related activities that have an indirect impact on tourism. The Business Development Bank of Canada has invested<lb/> CAD 1.97 billion in the tourism sector. Further support is provided from the direct control and operation of iconic<lb/> tourism attractions and programmes to market Canada as a destination (<ref type="biblio">Industry Canada, 2011</ref>). In particular for<lb/> SMEs, which amount to 98% of tourism firms, Canada offers strategic promotion activities, training, market<lb/> readiness, quality assurance and mentoring programmes in a co-ordinated fashion across the three levels of<lb/> government. The main uptakes from this experience are in the framework conditions for public participation and the<lb/> interaction with other key players, as well as in the role of public intervention in supporting demand-led<lb/> developments. Canada has set up a strategy that incorporates all levels of government and the private sector to<lb/> boost productivity in tourism, offering support from public banks for direct and indirect tourism-related activities, in<lb/> particular SMEs that could serve a good example of horizontal and vertical co-ordination.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: Canada (2013), Industry Canada (2011).<lb/> In Egypt, an initiative targeting the inclusion of women and young people in entrepreneurial activities<lb/> came from a non-governmental organisation. ENID/El Nidaa was established in 2012 to promote<lb/> economically viable and sustainable development, income generation and employment opportunities in<lb/> Upper Egypt. Based on the One Village, One Product model, the initiative supports the provision of<lb/> technical and vocational training, including for entrepreneurship and financial literacy skills, as well as<lb/> apprenticeships. Between 2012 and 2015, the initiative has supported 764 beneficiaries and 549 job<lb/> opportunities. Over half of the 20 participating villages in Qena, Egypt&apos;s second poorest governorate, are<lb/> producing handicrafts for the Egyptian and export market. The ambition is to replicate the approach<lb/> nationwide and address rural-urban disparities in poverty and economic opportunity.<lb/></figure>

			<p>There are also some specific issues that may justify public intervention to support or incentivise<lb/> existing and viable tourism SMEs, including those that could find finance in the market. This may be the<lb/> case for firms producing intangibles, integrating new digital technologies, or investing in green energies<lb/> for renovation projects to improve energy and water efficiency, emissions mitigation and solid waste<lb/> management, for example. These public interventions may be sector neutral, or tourism specific.<lb/> In Mexico, a pilot programme to reduce greenhouse emissions has been implemented in the states of<lb/> Quintana Roo, Campeche and YucatÃ¡n. The initiative promotes the use of solar heating of water in hotels<lb/> as an environmentally friendly approach. The pilot is scheduled to run until 2018 and if successful, the<lb/> intention is to expand the initiative Mexico-wide (Box 5).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 5. Pilot programme to promote use of green energies in hotels in Mexico<lb/> Since 2015, a pilot programme is being implemented in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula in Mexico to increase uptake of<lb/> green energy by hotels. The programme has been designed by the Federal Government, the Secretariat of Energy,<lb/> the National Commission for the Efficient Use of Energy and the United Nations Development Program, with the<lb/> purpose of decreasing the environmental footprint of the tourism sector by reducing greenhouse emissions. The<lb/> programme intends to extract successful lessons from this pilot initiative, to assess the viability of expanding it<lb/> across the whole Mexican territory. The pilot project was launched in the states of Quintana Roo, Campeche, and<lb/> YucatÃ¡n, providing financing support to small, medium and large hotels that are not part of hotel chains. This<lb/> includes technical advice, training and financing for the acquisition and installation of systems of solar heating of<lb/> water with a model based on the savings generated by the reduction in gas consumption.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The programme offers long-term loans (up to 5 years) at a fixed interest rate up to a maximum of<lb/> MXN 15 million. These loans are provided to support the replacement of existing water heating systems with green<lb/> energy (solar) systems. In addition, the programme offers public guarantees from the public development bank<lb/> responsible for promoting financing to exporting companies, Bancomext. These guarantees support commercial<lb/> loans from Banco Santander. Interest-rate subsidies are also provided by the Trust Fund for energy transition and<lb/> uptake of sustainable energy systems. At time of writing, the programme has installed 2.5 million square-metres of<lb/> solar heating systems, equivalent to 3 000 hotel rooms. The end of the pilot programme (and thus the assessment)<lb/> is scheduled for 2018.<lb/></p>

			<p>Austria, the &quot;klimaactiv mobil&quot; programme has provided EUR 80 million in subsidies to promote<lb/> environmentally friendly green mobility solutions, including fleet conversions to alternative vehicles. It has<lb/> a particular emphasis on e-mobility, mobility management, cycling and walking, as well as demand-<lb/>oriented public transport and car sharing systems. The programme supports businesses and local<lb/> authorities, as well as tourism and leisure organisations and associations, by providing up to 30% of the<lb/> investment costs of eco-friendly mobility projects, and makes important contributions to meeting the<lb/> environmental policy goals and legal obligations in Austria and the European Union. In particular, it offers<lb/> funding bonus to incentivise regional mobility projects led by tourism associations. This programme is part<lb/> of a wider sector-neutral programme to promote environmental sustainability.<lb/> In the Philippines, a capacity building project called Grassroots for Entrepreneurship in Eco-Tourism<lb/> (GREET) was introduced in 2008, with the aim of developing eco-tourism and creating jobs and income<lb/> opportunities for rural communities. The initiative grants funds of between PHP 50 000 and PHP 100 000<lb/> to projects developing sustainable tourism ideas. Applicants must be registered businesses operating at an<lb/> existing eco-tourism site and possess sufficient operational funds to sustain the project. In addition to<lb/> financing, successful applicants benefit from skills training and capacity-building measures. The Donsol<lb/> eco-tourism project is an example of an initiative that has been successfully championed by this<lb/> programme.<lb/></p>

			<p>A supra-national initiative led by the European Union, the SWITCH-Asia programme supports<lb/> sustainable tourism transformation in Asia, and highlights the role of governments in providing not only a<lb/> roadmap of eco-transformation of the industry, but also helping firms access to financing to implement<lb/> sustainability solutions (UNEP, 2015).<lb/> Elsewhere, tailored initiatives have also been introduced to support digitalisation and helping tourism<lb/> firms to cope with structural change. Research on the knowledge and capacity of tourism SMEs to use<lb/> information and communication technologies indicates that the main difficulty encountered by firms in<lb/> implementing digital technologies is related to lack of training (65% of responses), followed by the<lb/> involved costs and uncertain returns (54%). When considering whether to invest in new digital<lb/> technologies, lack of finance is cited as a main impediment (57%) (<ref type="biblio">Grant Thornton, 2015</ref>).<lb/> In Italy, fiscal incentives have been introduced to encourage existing tourism SMEs to upgrade the<lb/> digital infrastructure and systems in the business. An evaluation of the impact of this initiative is ongoing,<lb/> but initial indications are positive. It has been noted however that financial measures alone will be<lb/> insufficient to support tourism SMEs to adapt to the digital economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are also examples of the private sector taking steps to fill an observed gap in the market.<lb/> Unicredit commercial bank in Italy aims to help tourism companies to incorporate digital technologies in<lb/> their daily transactions, in order to analyse consumer behaviour and facilitate services (e.g. dealing with<lb/> no-shows, deposit management, check-in made by credit and debit cards). In particular, the bank has<lb/> invested in a start-up company involved in the banks&apos; accelerator programme, &quot; Travel Appeal &quot; , which<lb/> monitors the digital reputation of hotels. This is part of a wider initiative called UniCredit 4 Tourism,<lb/> which includes a commitment to deliver EUR 2 billion of new finance by 2018 through a range of products<lb/> including seasonal and medium-term loans backed by public collateral (&quot;Bond Italia 4 Tourism&quot;).<lb/> UniCredit reports the development of a variety of short, medium and long term financial products designed to<lb/> better meet the needs of tourism SME needs, for example allowing for repayment of both capital and interest<lb/> during high season and interest-only during low season (Box 6).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 6. Private sector initiative to expand the financial products for tourism SMEs in Italy<lb/></head>

			<p>Launched in mid-April 2015, the UniCredit 4 Tourism project aims to support the tourism SMEs in their growth<lb/> path by providing a wide range of financial and non-financial products and services, while improving UniCredit&apos;s<lb/> reputation in the tourism sector. The initiative recognises that the financing needs of tourism businesses may differ<lb/> from businesses in other sectors (e.g. seasonality), requiring banks and financial institutions to reshape their<lb/> products and offers in order to satisfy these different needs. The initiative sets a target of EUR 2 billion in loans and<lb/> 30 000 new customers between 2015-18, helping tourism companies to grow and to acquire technology and<lb/> management expertise. Approximately 75% of the lending target of EUR 2 billion is intended for firms with sales of<lb/> less than EUR 5 million, given the predominance of micro-enterprises in the sector. The main financial products<lb/> UniCredit is offering as part of the initiative are: long-term loans for up to 22 years, seasonal loans with principal<lb/> payment only in early stages and Bond Italia 4 Tourism which consists of medium-term loan backed by public<lb/> collateral from the Italian Fund for Small and Medium Enterprises. Additionally, the bank offers products dedicated to<lb/> the renewal of technical equipment, with the support of soft loans through the Bank&apos;s new project Subito Banca<lb/> Store, an online and offline marketplace dedicated to its customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Japan, many traditional accommodation providers report difficulty in accessing finance is a barrier<lb/> to modernising the business structure to better cater to international tourists. This includes updating and<lb/> renovating facilities, such as providing Wi-Fi, introducing foreign language signage and making websites<lb/> available in multiple languages for overseas visitors. Based on this diagnostic, the Regional Economic<lb/> Vitalisation Corporation has made finance and expertise available to local companies through public-<lb/>private funds in order to help tourism firms cope with structural change. The initiative aims to trigger the<lb/> inflow of private sector investment, create a stable and sustainable financing system, and maximise the<lb/> tourism potential of the area. This will require investment know-how and human resources to support<lb/> tourism-oriented urban planning and development.<lb/></p>

			<head>Promoting new financing approaches with greater participation by the private and civil sectors<lb/></head>

			<p>While bank financing will continue to be crucial for the SME sector, a more diversified set of SME<lb/> financing options is needed to strengthen capital structures and decrease the dependency on borrowing<lb/> (OECD, 2015a). Greater attention is now being focused on the development of non-bank financing<lb/> instruments such as asset-based finance, alternative debt, crowdfunding and hybrid instruments. While<lb/> equity and hybrid financing is only relevant for a small subset of larger SMEs, asset-based finance (e.g.<lb/> leasing, asset-based lending, factoring, purchase order finance, warehouse receipts) and alternative debt<lb/> mechanisms (e.g. crowdfunding, securitised debts, corporate or covered bonds) may hold potential for<lb/> tourism SMEs and entrepreneurs. Innovative and alternative financing methods remain underdeveloped,<lb/> due in part to bureaucratic and regulatory constraints, as well as a lack of knowledge and understanding.<lb/> This is the case for SMEs in general, not just tourism.<lb/> Peer-to-peer lending (also known as crowd-lending) and equity crowdfunding are innovative<lb/> financing approaches that provide businesses and individuals with a simple, low-cost way to raise capital<lb/> from public investors (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). These now internet-based models provide an alternative source of<lb/> financing for tourism businesses that do not readily have access to financing through traditional means.<lb/> Legislative changes are opening up opportunities for projects to raise funds from many investors, each<lb/> contributing small amounts of financing, while diminishing transaction costs as these investments are made<lb/> online and through bank transfers. Another advantage of these finance techniques is that they enable the<lb/> borrower to gather funds in a shorter time span than bank loans (<ref type="biblio">Robano, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Table 5. Understanding equity crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending<lb/> Instrument<lb/> Description<lb/> Equity<lb/> crowdfunding<lb/></figure>

			<p>Equity crowdfunding provides a means for investors from the &quot;crowd&quot; (or investing public) to invest<lb/> in a project or firm in exchange for shares. Firms sometimes offer &quot;perks&quot; or rewards (such as<lb/> company products or discounts) in exchange for investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firms stipulate the amount they wish to raise from investors. Once this funding is utilised, any<lb/> surplus (minus fees) becomes available to the firm for its use.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crowdfunding is usually facilitated via an online equity crowdfunding intermediary and is most<lb/> commonly used by newer firms at the earlier stages of their development.<lb/> Peer-to-peer<lb/> lending<lb/> Peer-to-peer lending is a form of debt crowdfunding. It matches people who want loans with people<lb/> who are potentially willing to fund those loans. The matching is completed via an intermediary â€“ a<lb/> peer-to-peer lending service, typically provided online.<lb/></p>

			<p>Borrowers list the details of their request (the amount sought, the intended use) on a peer-to-peer<lb/> lending website. Lenders browse the website to decide which loans to invest in.<lb/> Peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding have been around for more than 10 years. The use of<lb/> these instruments is well developed in China and the United Kingdom, for example, while Austria is<lb/> another country where the uptake of these initiatives has been strong, doubling the forecasted global rate of<lb/> growth in <ref type="biblio">2015 (OECD, 2016</ref>). In the United States, equity crowdfunding was limited to accredited<lb/> investors until 2015, but has since been open to non-accredited investors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although not yet much used in tourism, these models offer considerable potential as a source of<lb/> capital for tourism SMEs. Tourism service providers are well suited for this innovative finance technique,<lb/> which creates a network of investors and spreads the financial risk. These approaches also serving the<lb/> double purpose of providing finance and supporting local development: people invest in projects they care<lb/> about, to help local firms, or to create jobs. Equity crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending can have a<lb/> financial motive, where projects provide and expected rate of return, or a social motive where investors<lb/> donate money or fund projects in exchange for non-monetary rewards, such as free hotel nights or pre-<lb/>orders of products (<ref type="biblio">Robano, 2014</ref>).<lb/> In New Zealand, legislative changes implemented as part of broader reforms to New Zealand<lb/> securities law in 2014 included the introduction of peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding into the<lb/> country&apos;s financial system. While these forms of capital-raising are a relatively new feature of New<lb/> Zealand&apos;s capital markets, they have had a positive impact by deepening the markets and improving the<lb/> flow of growth capital to SMEs. Desk research shows that there are two operating crowdfunding platforms<lb/> that have several offers for tourism-related projects. While uptake by tourism SMEs has been limited so<lb/> far, this is expected to increase as time develops and these approaches become more well-known. For<lb/> example, a GPS-based tour guide app raised NZD 211 000 to fund the growth of its local sales force and<lb/> the expansion of its business into the Australian market (New Zealand case study).<lb/> Travelstarter is a global crowdfunding platform for tourism SMEs, which enables businesses to raise<lb/> money, increase marketing exposure and test new ideas. It can also be an important source of seed capital.<lb/> The TravelStarter platform has been used by projects in countries including Croatia, France, Portugal,<lb/> Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The start-up company that established the<lb/> platform received seed funding from the Slovenia Enterprise Fund, which provides grants for start-ups,<lb/> seed capital, venture capital, loan guarantees with interest rate subsidies and guarantees for bank loans for<lb/> technology-based SME innovation projects (Box 7).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7. TravelStarter crowdfunding platform for tourism businesses<lb/></head>

			<p>TravelStarter is a global crowdfunding platform that helps individuals and local businesses raise funds for their<lb/> tourism and travel related projects. Crowdfunding is an innovative way to source funds that can help kickstart projects<lb/> that may have difficulty securing financing. Traditional financing sources (e.g. loans, grants) can be complex to<lb/> procure, while the paperwork, legislative procedures and time required to receive other forms of funding creates a<lb/> bottleneck for many entrepreneurs. Crowdfunding allows an idea to be tested in the real world, as potential customers<lb/> are the first ones to back the venture and become an active part of it. SME&apos;s use crowdfunding to communicate with<lb/> potential customers and build momentum behind an idea, as people are invited to be a part of the project.<lb/></p>

			<p>TravelStarter offers two funding options for projects: a fixed funding option, where the entrepreneur only<lb/> receives the financing if the funding goal is reached, otherwise all funds are returned to the backers; and a flexible<lb/> funding option, where the entrepreneurs receives any funds are raised, but pay a higher fee (9% instead of 4%) if<lb/> they do not reach their funding goal. Travellers select a destination and search for a project to fund, and claim an in-<lb/>kind reward in return for funding a project (e.g. overnight stay in a guesthouse, bicycle rental). Examples of projects<lb/> financing through the TravelStarter crowdfunding platform:<lb/></p>

			<p>France: A platform connecting tourists with local guides, Guide Like You, used TravelStarter to finance the<lb/> platform&apos;s launch and get marketing exposure. The platform is now active in Paris, Toulouse, Amsterdam, London<lb/> and other cities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>United Kingdom: Safehouse Hostel in Cardiff raised over USD 10 000 to finance renovation work on a historic<lb/> city-centre building and generated free publicity; the hostel was booked full for several months after it opened.<lb/> United States: Pacific Tradewinds Hostel in San Francisco ran a successful marketing campaign to upgrade<lb/> and renovate its co-working space for travelling entrepreneurs, and promote the venue to locals and travellers alike.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the United Kingdom, a government-backed, private sector-led initiative, Responsible Finance,<lb/> offers alternative finance sources to individuals, businesses, and social enterprises that are unable to find<lb/> finance in the market, because of lack of credit history, trading track record, or collateral, for example. The<lb/> financed initiatives are conducted at the local level, and finance instruments are accompanied with<lb/> informal technical assistance, mentoring and support. The repayment schedule is tailored to the needs of<lb/> the borrowers. Tourism projects have benefited from this micro-financing scheme (Box 8).<lb/> The products offered by responsible finance providers target a segment of the population that is<lb/> unable or unwilling to access finance from traditional sources. However, while about 64% of finance<lb/> providers can cover their operating costs from their lending activities, the remaining 36% need public<lb/> support to close the gap in operating costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 8. Micro-finance and social enterprise funding for SMEs in the United Kingdom<lb/></head>

			<p>Responsible finance providers in the United Kingdom are professional social enterprises that re-invest profits<lb/> to help more people and businesses to access finance. Providers raise capital for lending from private and public<lb/> sources, including loans from commercial banks and social investors, grants from government, trusts and<lb/> foundations, and equity from stakeholders. In 2015, 51 responsible finance providers lent GBP 251 million and<lb/> provided financial literacy and technical assistance to 57 756 customers, including micro and small firm, social<lb/> enterprises, individuals and homeowners. Loans to the micro and SME segment in 2015 amounted to GBP 98<lb/> million and contributing to an. This contributed to increasing turnover by GBP 147 million, creating 9 584 new<lb/> businesses and 14 433 new jobs, and safeguarding 1 225 existing firms and 5 431 jobs. About 90 % of the<lb/> businesses have fewer than 9 employees. Furthermore, GBP 69 million was raised in new capital. The main<lb/> institutions involved are the Regional Growth Fund and the European Regional Development Fund (both public-<lb/>private investment models) along with the Start Up Loan scheme. Responsible finance providers generate income<lb/> through interest and fees from lending, portfolio management fees, and in some cases, revenue grants. However,<lb/> while about 64% of finance providers can cover their operating costs from their lending activities, the remaining 36%<lb/> need public support to close the gap in operating costs.<lb/> Two examples of tourism related projects in the accommodation sector financed through this initiative are<lb/> LoveLane vintage camping company (www.lovelanecaravans.co.uk) and Blackswan self-catering cottage<lb/> (www.blackswancottagepickering.co.uk). LoveLane Caravans secured the funding needed to increase production<lb/> and expand the campsite in the form of a loan from the local community development financing institution, which<lb/> also put the company in touch with a trust fund manager who help identify the core strategy of the business as part<lb/> of the application process. An added bonus of the funding was that it freed up working capital for a marketing<lb/> budget. The owner of the Blackswan Collage was able to transition from jobseeking allowance to entrepreneurship<lb/> with support from the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, and was allowed to pay small instalments during the first 6<lb/> months to ease initial burden. Non-financial support services including mentoring and support developing a<lb/> marketing strategy and strong business plan complemented the loan.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering innovation, entrepreneurship and the creation of new tourism firms<lb/></head>

			<p>The evidence on financing innovation, entrepreneurship, and the creation of new tourism firms from<lb/> the case studies and survey responses shows that the most common instrument used is grants for innovative<lb/> ideas (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Broader OECD work on the financing of business research and innovation shows that<lb/> grants and subsidised loans are widely used in OECD countries, and are complemented by indirect<lb/> instruments such as pursuing an enabling environment for the creation and development of new ideas (e.g.<lb/> business incubators and accelerators), where the innovators can be connected to finance providers (OECD,<lb/> 2011).<lb/> Moreover, public financial support for the creation of these incubators is present in the case studies<lb/> for France (private initiative, public and private funding), Portugal (public initiative, public funding) and<lb/> Slovenia (public, private, and academic initiative, and public funding). The case studies show that the<lb/> incubators benefited the public financial support for their creation, irrespective of the support that<lb/> incubators in turn provide to innovative entrepreneurs. For example, the creation of the Welcome City Lab<lb/> in Paris benefited from a EUR 80 000 grant from the City of Paris to develop the tourism incubator.<lb/> In Slovenia, the Bank of Tourism Potentials was established as a joint partnership project to<lb/> encourage innovation and creativity in Slovenian tourism, involving the Slovenian Tourist Board, the<lb/> Ministry of Economic Development and Technology and the University of Primorska. Since 2006, this<lb/> initiative provides a platform to exchange tourism-related ideas, resources and knowledge, and facilitate<lb/> co-operation and interaction. Financing and mentoring support foster the realisation of the most creative<lb/> and innovative ideas. An expert jury evaluates the ideas submitted to the web-platform, with grants<lb/> awarded to the most promising ideas. The creation of the tourism incubator (Snovalec) to realise the ideas<lb/> is the result of the co-ordinated action from the public sector, academia, and private actors (business angels<lb/> and entrepreneurs). Snovalec also benefits from public support from the Ministry of Development.<lb/> (Slovenia case study).<lb/></p>

			<p>In France, a capital development fund called France Tourism Investment, has been created for tourism<lb/> SMEs by the public investment bank Bpifrance. A proportion of these investments are earmarked to<lb/> financing innovation and e-tourism. This fund is open to third party contributors and fundraising of<lb/> between EUR 80 million and EUR 100 million is expected with a commitment of EUR 50 million from<lb/> Bpifrance. Other conventional Bpifrance financing and guarantee instruments available include: an<lb/> unsecured loan of between EUR 100 000 â€“ EUR 200 000 to members of the Best Western chain for a<lb/> period of 5 years, with a grace period of 2 years; an equity loan for restaurants of between EUR 40 000 â€“<lb/> EUR 600 000 over 6 years (with a 1-year grace period); and an equity loan for hotels of between<lb/> EUR 30 000 â€“ EUR 600 000 over 7 years (with a 2-year grace period).<lb/> In Portugal, the Action Plan Tourism 2020 seeks to promote entrepreneurship and mitigate barriers<lb/> SMEs face in accessing credit. This is part of a strategic economy-wide approach to promoting SMEs and<lb/> supporting business innovation and entrepreneurship. Portugal has in place credit and equity options to<lb/> finance working capital, hotel renovations, and tourism-related activities. The Portuguese Tourism Board<lb/> has developed a diversified set of measures targeted at tourism, including participating in the Lisbon<lb/> Challenge incubation programme. This initiative provides tourism-related tech start-ups with the<lb/> opportunity to meet mentors and investors and participate in workshops, pitch sessions and networking<lb/> events. The creation of Tourism Day as part of the Lisbon Challenge incubator and accelerator of<lb/> enterprises is a public initiative (Portugal case study).<lb/> Recognising the need to provide different solutions for different needs in the tourism business<lb/> lifecycle, other initiatives in Portugal include: financial engineering instruments based on risk capital,<lb/> signing protocols with several credit institutions to make it easier for tourism businesses to access funding<lb/> in a timely and cost-effective manner and an SME growth credit line facilitating access to credit for<lb/> businesses in the tourism sector through interest rate subsidies and mechanisms within the national<lb/> guarantee system, as well as supporting entrepreneurial activities through venture capital firms, real estate<lb/> investment and mutual guarantee funds. The Portuguese Tourism Board also organises awareness raising<lb/> and information sessions on range of instruments for SMEs and entrepreneurs<lb/> Indirect support is also provided by countries in easing the conditions for the private sector to bring in<lb/> finance and knowledge. This is the case in the Netherlands and Sweden, for example. In the Netherlands,<lb/> LI Leisure Investment is an initiative of two Dutch leisure companies that provide finance and expertise to<lb/> sustainable and innovative companies and start-ups. The initiative finances up to EUR 100 000 per project<lb/> in the Dutch leisure branch, and specifically excludes traditional forms of hotel and catering industries.<lb/> Likewise, in Sweden, the private sector Swedish Hospitality Industry Association, Vista, and the Hotel and<lb/> Restaurant Workers Union are co-financing an annual research and development fund of SEK 8 million to<lb/> strengthen research and innovation and the long-term development of the sector. Notably, while in the<lb/> Netherlands&apos; initiative the hotel and catering sectors are excluded, they are specifically targeted in<lb/> Sweden&apos;s approach.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 9. Financing and profitability key innovation obstacles for tourism SMEs in Sweden<lb/></head>

			<p>Tourism SMEs see innovation and the development of new products and services as more important than the<lb/> average Swedish SME. They also perceive a bigger need for investments in new equipment and building facilities<lb/> than the average Swedish SME. This is the case specifically for hotels and restaurants. However, the biggest<lb/> obstacles for innovation among the tourism SMEs is regarded to be funding and requirements of short term<lb/> profitability. Companies consider access to loans and credits and external owner capital to be less of an obstacle to<lb/> SME growth than labour availability, rules and regulations and competition from other companies. However, tourism<lb/> SMEs perceive that the challenges in finding funding and external venture capital are greater than the average<lb/> Swedish SME. Over half (53%) of the tourism SMEs see access to loans and credits as an obstacle, compared to<lb/> 42% of average enterprises. In particular, tourism companies that regard profitability as a major obstacle also see<lb/> access to loans and credits as a big challenge. Tourism SMEs are more likely to apply for public funding than other<lb/> companies. The relative amount of companies that get their application approved is about the same whether it is<lb/> enterprises in tourism or other sectors. Tourism SMEs with a mainly international market (which is 10% of the<lb/> tourism SMEs) see access of loans and credits as a much bigger obstacle than the enterprises that are only<lb/> nationally oriented.<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, in Sweden, a survey of SMEs indicates that the financing profile of tourism enterprises<lb/> constrains growth and innovation in the sector, limiting the capacity of tourism businesses to invest and<lb/> develop new products and services. The need for investment and development of new products and<lb/> services is greater among tourism than non-tourism SMEs, and is particularly strong among hotels and<lb/> restaurants. Sweden public banks charge a higher-than market interest rate to avoid crowding out the<lb/> private sector. There is also a crowdfunding platform for businesses and a microfinance institution (Box 9).<lb/> Other OECD evidence on financial policies supporting innovation for tourism firms include the use of<lb/> direct equity finance (e.g. Poland and the United Kingdom), tax incentives for investment in innovative<lb/> start-ups and SMEs (e.g. Turkey), ICT-infrastructure and digitalisation (e.g. Italy), or in research and<lb/> development (e.g. Canada, France and Portugal); and support to social innovation (e.g. Chile, United<lb/> Kingdom) (OECD, 2016).<lb/></p>

			<head>Building the financial capacity of tourism SMEs<lb/></head>

			<p>Providing finance instruments alone is unlikely in itself to bring success â€“ on the demand-side,<lb/> improving access to finance options will require some capacity building on the part of SMEs to<lb/> complement the improved finance offer, along with dissemination of the opportunities available, in order<lb/> to increase awareness and uptake. This issue of lack of skills on the part of entrepreneurs, including<lb/> insufficient financial knowledge and management skills and lack of awareness of financing options, needs<lb/> to be addressed at the same time, if not before, the issue of access to finance, otherwise the financing<lb/> problems of the firm can be aggravated.<lb/></p>

			<p>In many countries, the provision of financial instruments is complemented by training, mentoring<lb/> and/or advisory services, as well as tools to promote awareness and make it easier to access financing<lb/> supports and improving information on SME financing. In the majority of countries surveyed for this<lb/> report, the policies to ease financial access for SMEs and entrepreneurs target both the supply and the<lb/> demand side at the same time, offering not only credit loans, but also non-financial support to optimise the<lb/> chances of success in the loan repayment.<lb/> In Mexico, the Ministry of Tourism co-operates with public financing institutions and agencies to<lb/> include dedicated tourism programmes as part of their wider SME support programmes, which take<lb/> account of the tourism business cycle. The National Fund for Tourism Development, which facilitates<lb/> financing, also provides consulting services and technical assistance to support entrepreneurs to develop a<lb/> business plan and help tourism SMEs identify funding opportunities. If a project is deemed to be viable,<lb/> the Fund connects the firm with finance provides for credit loans, and in some cases offers public<lb/> guarantees (Box 10).<lb/> In Switzerland, the Swiss Society for Hotel Credit provides consulting services to improve access to<lb/> finance through new investment evaluations, feasibility studies and creation of new, innovative business<lb/> concepts. It provides advice on investment related grants, empowers individual companies through<lb/> knowledge transfer and provide co-operation related support for companies in the tourism and hospitality<lb/> sector. The Swiss Hospitality Investment Forum is a key knowledge and contact platform in this regard.<lb/> In Austria, the Austrian Tourism Development Bank similarly offers mentoring and advisory services.<lb/> In addition, it also has a blog which provides up-to-date information on performance and available funding<lb/> to improve the situation of tourism SMEs.<lb/> In New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment part-funds Business Mentors<lb/> New Zealand, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to supporting the success and growth of small<lb/> businesses through the knowledge and experience of volunteer mentors. Business Mentors New Zealand&apos;s<lb/> programmes are targeted at owners of SMEs currently trading and employing fewer than 25 employees,<lb/> and an accelerated programme for start-ups. This initiative is not tourism specific, but is available to<lb/> tourism SMEs.<lb/> In Ireland, the national tourism development agency, FÃ¡ilte Ireland, provides a number of business<lb/> tools to support tourism SMEs, including practical guides and easy-to-use templates to support business<lb/> planning, calculator tools to support funding requests and help to build financial literacy of entrepreneurs.<lb/> Calculator tools aim to support financial decision making in tourism businesses, helping to calculate<lb/> profitability of each department of a business, profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin), overhead<lb/> costs, pay costs and break-even point. Ireland has also developed an online tool to promote awareness of<lb/> the different financing and other supports available to SMEs, including tourism SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the National Development Plan 2012-18, the National Development Bank for Foreign Trade,<lb/> Bancomext, is tasked with facilitating access to financing in key sectors of the economy, including tourism. Together<lb/> with the National Entrepreneurship Institute, Bancomext offers a tailored programme for tourism SMEs which aims<lb/> to facilitate access to financing and increase the competitiveness of SMEs in the tourism value chain. The<lb/> programme operates through the National SME Guarantee Programme, which is a strategic instrument to increase<lb/> the volume of bank lending to SMEs. It offers loans of up to MXN 20 million (USD1.2 million) to SMEs, and up to<lb/> MXN 40 million (USD 2.4 million) to small and medium hotels. The interest rate is 1-3% lower than commercial bank<lb/> rates. Bancomext offers preferential loan guarantees of up to 75% to facilitate access to credit and improve interest<lb/> rates, and supports the financial intermediaries in the case of non-compliance.</p>

			<figure>Between 2013-15, the SME<lb/> Financing Programme for Tourism benefited over 3 000 tourism businesses which were unable to access credit from<lb/> the commercial banks, with a credit spill of USD 718 million. In 2015, MXN 300 million (USD 18.8 million) was<lb/> allocated to the National SME Guarantee Programme to facilitate access to financing for SMEs in the tourism value<lb/> chain. The objective is to generate a credit spill of MXN 6 000 million (USD 375 million), over 20 times the guarantee<lb/> amount. It is estimated that 25-30% of these resources will cover SMEs from the tourism sector. The volumes traded<lb/> show that Bancomext trades with firms of medium size, more than with micro or small firms. Bancomext also has a<lb/> pilot programme to promote the use of green energy in hotels (to heat water).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The National Fund for Tourism Development (FONATUR) provides consulting services and technical<lb/> assistance for tourism SMEs to help improve the viability of new investment projects, with a specific focus on job<lb/> creation and regional development. The goal is to support entrepreneurs to develop a business plan and help<lb/> tourism SMEs identify funding opportunities from financial institutions and/or government agencies. The consulting<lb/> services are based on the methodology used by FONATUR to develop new tourism projects, considering aspects<lb/> such as site assessment, tourism cluster, market analysis, technical architecture, operation, marketing and financial<lb/> analysis. The programme solves one of the major challenges faced by tourism SMEs: improvement of financing<lb/> options through a structured and solid business plan. By helping demonstrate that an entrepreneur&apos;s project is viable<lb/> and profitable and that the level of risk is within acceptable parameters, FONATUR encourages new investments<lb/> within the tourism sector. Projects deemed feasible by the programmes technical team tend to have access to better<lb/> financing options through development and private banks.<lb/></p>

			<head>PART II: TOURISM SME AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FINANCING CASE STUDIES<lb/></head>

			<p>This section presents selected case studies on financing approaches and good practices. The case<lb/> studies focus on promoting the uptake of new finance instruments, stimulating innovation and creating new<lb/> tourism entrepreneurs, and supporting tourism SME development. The cases highlight initiatives to<lb/> stimulate innovation and encourage entrepreneurship (France, Portugal, Slovenia), support the<lb/> development of existing tourism SMEs (Austria, Greece and Switzerland), and promote broader uptake of<lb/> new finance instruments (New Zealand). Each case study provides technical information to support the<lb/> policy discussion and may serve as a learning model.<lb/></p>

			<head>Austria: One-stop shop for tourism-related SME finance<lb/> Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>In Austria, tourism SME finance activities are co-ordinated through a one-stop window organised as a<lb/> public-private partnership (PPP), the Austrian Bank for Tourism Development (OEHT). Through the three<lb/> largest banks, the private sector provides the infrastructure and expertise in tourism finance activities and<lb/> channels the resources provided by the public sector towards viable projects. The targets of this policy are<lb/> all tourism and leisure firms registered with the Austrian Chamber of Commerce (more than 90 000<lb/> enterprises, or 17.2% of members), of which 99.5% are SMEs. The tourism and leisure sectors jointly<lb/> generate 13.5% of GDP and support one in every six jobs in the country, directly and indirectly.<lb/> OEHT was originally established in 1947 to act as an intermediary between the financiers of the<lb/> European Recovery Programme and the beneficiaries. Today, it is a one-stop shop for targeted tourism<lb/> programmes, offering a wide range of financial instruments including once-off grants, low interest and<lb/> subsidised loans, and government guarantees. OEHT aims to support government growth strategies, foster<lb/> quality improvements and boost business start-ups by channelling local, regional, federal, and European<lb/> resources towards economic development.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance instruments offered<lb/></head>

			<p>Tourism needs are financed through direct and indirect debt-instruments, including grants, low-<lb/>interest loans, subsidies and public guarantees. These are offered at better terms than those found on the<lb/> market, supporting the regional development rationale. The public intervention is based on the diagnostic<lb/> that tourism SMEs have a poor equity-base and long-term financing needs, and are classified as high-risk<lb/> by the private banks, resulting in high interest rate charges.<lb/> The Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy allocated EUR 19.2 million from the<lb/> national budget to OEHT in 2015, of which EUR 8.5 million (44%) was reserved for once-off grants. The<lb/> balance was used to subsidise interest rates, based on the observation that 3-star hotels face higher rates<lb/> than 4-and 5-star hotels (by on average 0.8% points).<lb/> Together with loans from the European Recovery Programme-fund and those refinanced by the<lb/> European Investment Bank, a total credit volume of EUR 221.3 million is available to support new and<lb/> existing tourism SMEs. On average, about 800 applications are funded annually. Hotel projects account for<lb/> 90% of the annual investment volume, key aspects of which include quality improvement, size<lb/> enhancement, and spa and wellness opportunities. Around 5% of investments are realised by restaurants<lb/> and other leisure businesses.<lb/> OEHT is able to directly finance investment projects from EUR 10 000 up to EUR 10 million. The<lb/> financial instruments allocated are loans from the European Recovery Programme-fund, loans subsidised<lb/> by the Austrian Government or once-off grants for less significant investments. Loans are usually repaid<lb/> based on twice-a-year rates, with a general maturity of between 10 and 15 years. In addition, government<lb/> guarantees can be applied to every loan granted by OEHT, as well as to any commercial loan up to a<lb/> maximum of EUR 4 million. Terms and conditions of the loans vary, interest rates are however rather low.<lb/> The annual provision charged for guarantees is 0.8 %. In more detail, the financial instruments are<lb/> allocated as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚· Investment projects under EUR 700 000: micro-credit from the European Recovery Programme-<lb/>fund up to EUR 500 000 or once-of grants, and governmental guarantees;<lb/> ï‚· Investment projects over EUR 700 000: three different types of loans available depending on<lb/> total investment sum and source of finance, financing up to 60 % of the total investment sum.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond financial support, OEHT also provides non-financial products: advice and mentoring at all<lb/> stages of tourism SMEs (start-up, development, expansion, restructuring). The benefit from having the<lb/> one-stop window for tourism related activities is the in-depth knowledge of the market, its potential,<lb/> opportunities and challenges.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>The main sources of funding for OEHT are the Austrian Government (loans, guarantees), the<lb/> European Recovery Programme-fund and the European Investment Bank. OEHT acts as trustee of the<lb/> European Recovery Programme-fund and is hence eligible to allocate loans and guarantees on behalf of<lb/> this fund. OEHT is further a partner of the European Investment Bank and administers the financial means<lb/> determined to support tourism businesses.<lb/> Within this public-private partnership, the public sector is responsible for the necessary political and<lb/> legal framework, to provide the private sector â€“ OEHT â€“ with the needed patronage and to allocate the<lb/> public funds. Jointly, the public and private sectors develop operational guidelines. The private sector<lb/> provides the practical information drawn from its day-to-day contact with the tourism market. The public<lb/> sector creates guidelines accounting for the industry-specific needs and focusing on the achievement of the<lb/> overall national goal. The private sector then is responsible for the day-to-day business. It evaluates the<lb/> projects&apos; adherence to the guidelines, makes sure these are followed, and verifies that the public funds are<lb/> only used to finance the subsidised project (earmarking of funds). The private sector must also ensure that<lb/> the subsidised projects are economically profitable. The key benefit of the partnership for the public sector<lb/> is there are no fixed costs. The private sector charges the public sector for every case processed, but bears<lb/> all other fixed costs (such as office rental, employees&apos; remuneration, or office expenses).<lb/> The OEHT plays a role in co-ordinating governmental and regional subsidies in tourism. It is in close<lb/> contact with the Government to ensure the subsidies provided achieve policy goals. It is also in close<lb/> contact with the different Austrian regions, so that all projects can access the available subsidies, but no<lb/> project is subsidised twice. The co-operation with Austria&apos;s political regions enables OEHT to act as one-<lb/>stop-shop, where clients apply for federal and regional subsidies, and reduces the administration effort and<lb/> costs as only one institute processes the application. Regional subsidies very often consist of subsidising<lb/> interest rates, so the ultimately offered product is a long-term, (nearly) interest-free loan for the client.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government guarantees allocated by OEHT on behalf of the Austrian Government are very often<lb/> a &quot; door-opener &quot; for tourism businesses: banks are given the requested securities to be able to finance the<lb/> tourism business. The Austrian Government bears the total risk for these government guarantees and the<lb/> OEHT is not held responsible in the event of legal proceedings/claims. Other means of securing loans<lb/> granted by OEHT on behalf of one of its partners are bank guarantees or mortgages, in which case OEHT<lb/> is bearing the risk.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key results<lb/></head>

			<p>This public-private partnership model results in no administration costs involved for the Austrian<lb/> Government beyond the fees charged for each case. The OEHT structure is entirely self-financing,<lb/> meaning that the actual costs involved are the costs of the subsidies, but no labour or administrative costs.<lb/> The rise in number of applications, especially for start-ups and guarantees, shows that the financial<lb/> instruments offered are positively received by the tourism industry in Austria. Applications to the<lb/> programme have average around 800 per year since 2012, and about 13% of these are from new firms<lb/> (</p>

			<table>Table 6).<lb/> Table 6. Number of approved applications to the Austrian Tourism Development Bank<lb/> 2012<lb/> 2013<lb/> 2014<lb/> 2015<lb/> 2016<lb/> Approved applications<lb/> 951<lb/> 780<lb/> 980<lb/> 515<lb/> 724<lb/> of which start-ups<lb/> 96<lb/> 85<lb/> 165<lb/> 83<lb/> 95<lb/> (in percentage)<lb/> 10%<lb/> 11%<lb/> 17%<lb/> 16%<lb/> 13%<lb/></table>

			<p>This model has proven to be highly successful in supporting tourism SMEs in Austria. The close<lb/> collaboration with the government means that overall growth strategies are supported, and the international<lb/> marketing campaigns creating a certain image of Austria as tourism destination and the reality tourists<lb/> experience align.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond the structural role played by this public-private partnership, OEHT also intervenes counter-<lb/>cyclically offering public guarantees to borrowing demands during economic downturns (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). A<lb/> restructuring support division within the partnership also offers financial support to companies in<lb/> economically challenging situations. In addition, OEHT is able to react with short-term guidelines to<lb/> specific needs of the tourism industry. For example, special assistance was provided for businesses<lb/> suffering from flooding in the region of the Danube in 2013. Current trends and tourism issues can be more<lb/> easily addressed, such as investments needed because of the climate change and resulting changes in the<lb/> seasonality of certain products, succession planning or business start-ups.<lb/></p>

			<p>Long-term loans are the main finance instrument used by OEHT â€“ in 2016 a total credit volume of<lb/> EUR 221.3 million was provided. The OEHT programme for financing tourism firms made<lb/> EUR 662.7 million available in 2016 to investment projects. Most of these were to existing tourism firms,<lb/> but OEHT is also reaching out to new start-ups tourism projects, which received EUR 17.6 million or 3%<lb/> of the total. Second in importance, public guarantees amounted to EUR 44.4 million in 2016, easing<lb/> financial uptake from the private sector. The OEHT finances no more than 60% of the project proposal;<lb/> this structure maintains the incentives for tourism firms to ensure the success of their project.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>The features of a one-stop shop for tourism SMEs is applied in several other OECD countries, as part<lb/> of a broader strategy of decreasing regulatory burdens on firms and simplifying administrative compliance.<lb/> While targeting the whole tourism SME sector, the information available concentrates only in the hotel and<lb/> accommodation uptake of credit loans.<lb/></p>

			<p>The OEHT targets both the innovation and development of tourism SMEs. The provision of subsidies<lb/> and grants to previously assessed firms with a viable project supports innovation. Subsidies provided by<lb/> OEHT have proven to be a strong motor of tourism investments. The key success factors of this public-<lb/>private partnership lie in the aggregated expertise and reliability of the institution. The clients benefit from<lb/> guidance and know-how, and the &quot; one-stop-shop &quot; for different kinds of tourism subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Through this public-private partnership solution to finance long-term tourism SME needs a set of<lb/> private banks brings in their knowledge and expertise to tourism finance, and evaluates potential projects<lb/> to be financed. Only viable projects are provided with long-term finance options using federal, state and<lb/> European funds. These projects are financed on longer terms than those offered by the market offers, and at<lb/> subsidised rates.<lb/> The Government is able to rely on a partner with the necessary know-how in both fields of operation<lb/> â€“ tourism and banking. Furthermore in the administration of government funds OEHT does not charge<lb/> extra fees, as it has a self-financing operational structure. Finally, by drawing on years of experience in<lb/> project evaluation, owners, partners and financiers of the OEHT can be confident that the funds are<lb/> allocated wisely and carefully.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main challenge for the OEHT and the Government is to constantly improve the offer, adhering to<lb/> market changes. Next to providing clients with stability and reliability by offering sustainable products<lb/> available on an ongoing basis, the flexibility to react to suddenly arising issues is of great importance. One<lb/> example for OEHT striving to adopt changes in the financial markets is the discussion of how to integrate<lb/> crowdfunding into the finance scheme that is currently in progress.<lb/> Still unresolved for Austria is the seasonality in tourism. Working capital and day-to-day needs have<lb/> problems in accessing finance. The main finance source for seasonal firms is overdrafts facilities. Leasing<lb/> is not widespread because of the high interest rates charged.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conditions for transferability<lb/></head>

			<p>A strong set of institutions is required to efficiently assign one-time grants to firms. The report<lb/> highlights the issue that it is one dimension of tourism firms (accommodation) that obtains access to long-<lb/>term loans, probably because of the capability to provide collateral. The OEHT programme has proven<lb/> successful as well in providing a countercyclical approach through indirect instruments (government<lb/> guarantees) in times of economic downturn.<lb/></p>

			<figure>FRANCE â€“ CREATING THE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS FOR TOURISM ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH WELCOME CITY LAB<lb/> Â© OECD â€“ FINANCING APPROACHES FOR TOURISM SMES AND ENTREPRENEURS 43<lb/> France: Creating the underlying conditions for tourism entrepreneurship with Welcome City Lab<lb/></figure>

			<head>Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>Welcome City Lab is a publicly-supported private incubator initiative aimed at fostering innovative<lb/> entrepreneurship in tourism-related activities. An incubator offers office space, training, mentoring, and<lb/> networking activities. Once a start-up project has been validated, the incubator connects the entrepreneur<lb/> with public and private finance providers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Launched in 2013, Welcome City Lab is a Paris-based SME employing four people. It offers<lb/> individual coaching and collective training workshops, along with a network of funders and mentor<lb/> entrepreneurs. The main features of Welcome City Lab approach are:<lb/> ï‚· Incubator for tourism firms â€“ support innovative start-ups in tourism-related activities.<lb/> ï‚· Training â€“ help start-ups become familiar with and gain an understanding of the tourism sector.<lb/> ï‚· Experimentation â€“ help start-ups to keep up with market demands.<lb/> ï‚· Economic intelligence â€“ identify trends in tourism innovation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Every year, a committee decide on the themes for the annual call for projects, under which potential<lb/> start-ups are to be chosen. The criteria to select projects focus on the capacity to undertake the innovation,<lb/> the potential for job creation, the contribution to growing the tourism offer in Paris, the human capital<lb/> skills of the team, and the viability of the business plan.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance instruments offered<lb/></head>

			<p>Welcome City Lab itself is not a finance provider, but after the incubator vets the feasibility of an<lb/> idea, public and private support in the form of debt and equity instruments are available (<ref type="table">Table 9</ref>).<lb/> The public support to innovators comes from Bpifrance and the City of Paris, which have two options<lb/> for funding start-up from registered incubators under the programme Investing for the Future (Programme<lb/></p>

				<formula>d&apos;investissements d&apos;avenir):<lb/></formula>

			<p>ï‚· Launch grants: the public bank grants up to 50% of the total cost in technical, juridical and<lb/> economic budget lines, to a maximum of EUR 30 000.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚· Development loans: the programme finances up to 50% through loans valued between<lb/> EUR 50 000 and EUR 100 000. The time needed to process the file is less than 3 months<lb/> from reception of the documents by Bpifrance, and 80% of the funds are available upon<lb/> signature, with the remaining 20% made available after inspection.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, Bpifrance offers guarantees to innovative start-ups for up to 70% of the loan, up to a<lb/> maximum of EUR 684 000. The Regional Development Agency (Paris Region Enterprises) is also a<lb/> funding partner for innovative projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond public fund providers, the incubator connects start-ups with their network of business angel<lb/> associations, individual venture capitalists and the private financial sector. While no detailed information<lb/> on the finance sources of start-ups is available, equity instruments are present. Finance sources vary<lb/> depending on the specific characteristics of the project and are composed of a mix of debt and equity<lb/> instruments, both public and private.<lb/> Once the project graduates from the incubator, it is up to each tourism firm to find and access the<lb/> available finance sources. The incubator does not follow-up on the financial details of each start-up.<lb/> Nevertheless, a key indicator of success is the rate of survival of start-ups after leaving the incubator. After<lb/> three years of existence, 90% of the firms which have graduated from the incubator are still on the market<lb/></p>

			<p>Welcome City Lab started in 2013.

In the beginning, the incubator sought mentoring and training with an independent network<lb/> of incubators, <ref type="biblio">Paris &amp; Co.<lb/></ref> This private initiative has received public support since the early stages. The City of Paris provided<lb/> initial support in the form of a grant of EUR 80 000 and the incubator continues to receive financial<lb/> support from the City of Paris in the order of EUR 80 000 per year, which covers about 8% of the total<lb/> budget. However, the main financial sources come from private funders, which provide 92% of the total<lb/> budget.<lb/> Public support is also provided in the form of credit loans to the sustainable projects that are vetted as<lb/> feasible by the incubator. The eligibility criteria to accept a start-up in the incubator is that the idea has to<lb/> be innovative, that is, the entrepreneur has to prove that the idea does not exist anywhere else.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key Results<lb/></head>

			<p>Since 2013, 415 tourism start-ups have been created (<ref type="table">Table 10</ref>). In the first year, the two main sectors<lb/> where start-ups concentrated were accommodation and at-home dinner parties. In 2014, the main trend was<lb/> the creation of online comparison sites of tourism offers. In 2015, 19% of start-ups were focused on<lb/> personalised tourism offers, such as theatre outings. Moreover, Welcome City Lab has created a database<lb/> with information from 1 300 tourism-related start-ups launched since 2007.<lb/></p>

It also organised more than 70 events, produced 53 collaborations between founding partners and<lb/> start-ups, and raised over EUR 12.5 million from investors.<lb/></table>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>The inclusion of a diversity of start-ups in the incubator is identified by the founder as a factor in the<lb/> success of the Welcome City Lab approach. This has helped to build synergies and complementarities, and<lb/> entrepreneurs can benefit from the different approaches that each one proposes. The diversity of sectors<lb/> that the start-ups concentrate on promotes an innovative ecosystem, and creates a virtuous circle.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another success factor is the interaction of the private sector with public actors (government) and<lb/> academia (Centre pour les Arts et les MÃ©tiers). The founders of Welcome City Lab come from all three<lb/> axes of this triple helix triangle, and contribute with their diverse approaches towards an innovative<lb/> ecosystem.<lb/></p>

			<p>The incubator found it challenging at the start to engage founders and partners in this venture, given<lb/> that it was an innovative project in the field of tourism, and potential supporters were reluctant to engage in<lb/> new and unexplored areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conditions for transferability<lb/></head>

			<p>The incubator is already working with several countries to replicate the experience and build an<lb/> ecosystem integrated to the local characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<head>Greece: Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development support for tourism<lb/> Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>The Island Tourism Entrepreneurship Action was launched in June 2013 to facilitate island tourism<lb/> businesses&apos; financing by providing loans for investment objectives and/or business development, with the<lb/> extra benefit of attractive borrowing terms. It is financed by the Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and<lb/> Development&apos;s (ETEAN) main Financial Engineering Instrument, the Entrepreneurship Fund, which<lb/> provided total initial funds of EUR 80 million.<lb/> The Island Tourism Entrepreneurship Action aims to support micro and small companies of the island<lb/> regions, by covering identified liquidity gaps. It was introduced with the goal of upgrading the country&apos;s<lb/> tourism product, and in particular to: upgrade service quality of tourism enterprises operating in island<lb/> areas; improve the competitiveness of tourism enterprises in Greek islands; improve the business<lb/> responsiveness during the tourist season; and ensure sustainability and growth prospects for tourism in the<lb/> Greek islands.<lb/> Tourism is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in Greece, gaining increased importance and<lb/> contributed to the rapid growth of economic and demographic indicators. The Greek island regions account<lb/> the bulk of beds/overnights in the country (about 60%) and have an absolute advantage over other areas,<lb/> due to their physical and cultural resources. The islands have managed to be relatively highly competitive<lb/> even in times of economic crisis.<lb/> However in a dynamic world market, the Greek islands&apos; tourism sector should be in a position to<lb/> maintain and increase its attractiveness not just for the well-known island destinations, but beyond. Greece<lb/> has unique geographic and geological features with more than 6 000 islands, islets and rocks, of which 117<lb/> islands are inhabited and 53 have a population of more than 1 000 inhabitants. Apart from a few well-<lb/>known islands, many other islands receive low tourist flows, often during just a couple of months of the<lb/> year.<lb/> Increasing the attractiveness of these islands is important to extend the length of the season and<lb/> directly influence the level of economic and social development. It also influences the welfare of local<lb/> islanders. Stay or migrate depends largely on the existence of jobs that meet the needs and expectations of<lb/> the local population. It can make it possible to maintain other crucial functions such as health centres,<lb/> schools, cultural events, maritime transport services, and spatial planning, which contribute to quality of<lb/> life of both for the tourists and the islanders. The sustainable development of these areas in an integrated<lb/> social and economic environment should therefore not be viewed superficial. It is important to ensure the<lb/> maintenance of tourism revenue, but also the quality of the tourist destination, within an increasingly<lb/> competitive environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance instruments offered<lb/></head>

			<p>The Island Tourism Entrepreneurship initiative provides long term loans for investment and/or<lb/> business development to support and strengthen the attractiveness of the island tourism product (</p>

			<table>Table 1<lb/> and Box 11).<lb/></table>

			<p>In creating this new loan product, ETEAN had to take into consideration the difficult financial<lb/> condition of the Greek banking system. This situation made it extremely difficult for banks to co-invest<lb/> capital together with ETEAN in order to form and finance the activity of the financial engineering<lb/> instrument. To achieve the necessary leverage, the innovation of Island Tourism Entrepreneurship was that<lb/> the necessary co-investment takes place between ETEAN and each approved island SME, at a ratio of<lb/> 70:30 of the total business proposal costs. Banks are not excluded from the programme, but play a different<lb/> but extremely significant role. Through their extensive network, the applications are received, checked and<lb/> then forwarded by the banks to ETEAN to be analysed and approved/rejected. The co-operating banks are<lb/> also responsible for the disbursements of the loans and for monitoring the progress of each disbursed loan<lb/> up until its full repayment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this way, ETEAN overcame a systemic problem which was a serious obstacle for the success of the<lb/> use of the financial engineering instrument, as the poor condition of the banking system together with the<lb/> obligation of co-investment meant that Greek businesses could not get access to finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>The Island Tourism Entrepreneurship programme is funded by the main financial engineering<lb/> instrument of ETEAN, the Entrepreneurship Fund. Existing and newly established micro and small<lb/> enterprises (EU Definition EC 361/2006) are eligible to apply for the loan product, provided they satisfy<lb/> certain criteria. Enterprises must be located within the boundaries of Greek territory and based on Greek<lb/> islands to be eligible for working capital loans, or based anywhere in Greece provided the requested<lb/> expenditure/investment will take place on a Greek island to be eligible for investment loans. Enterprises<lb/> must also have insurance and tax clearance at the date of the loan disbursement and an eligible activity<lb/> code according to the programme guidelines. SMEs excluded by the Regulation (EC 1998/2006) are not<lb/> eligible. This mainly excludes businesses in the primary sector of the economy.<lb/> Expenditure for the following purposes are eligible: construction, configuration, renovation,<lb/> restoration of buildings, facilities and the surrounding area; machinery and equipment; expertise rights;<lb/> software; certification of quality assurance systems; promotion; and operating costs (e.g. rental, payroll<lb/> expenses, third party fees, costs of raw materials, stock and merchandise).<lb/> Eligible expenditure means only the purchase of new equipment is covered. The loan is disbursed by<lb/> the bank directly in the suppliers&apos; accounts, payroll accounts, provision of services etc. The eligibility of<lb/> expenses on invoices and equivalent accounting documents issuing from operating expenditure<lb/> documentation. VAT related expenditure is considered non-eligible.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key results<lb/></head>

			<p>As of October 2016, 1 785 SME loan applications have been approved by ETEAN, which correspond<lb/> to a total of more than EUR 38.5 million. These funds together with the private sector&apos;s co-investment<lb/> mean that more than EUR 55 million was channelled into the islands&apos; economies under this action. About<lb/> 25% of the approved SMEs are start-ups, which shows that the programme had a significant impact as<lb/> approximately 440 new tourism businesses were created by using the programme&apos;s funds. At the same<lb/> time, in a period of financial depression and crisis, more than 1 340 already existing island tourism<lb/> businesses used the programme in order to maintain and strengthen their position (</p>

			<table>Table 12).<lb/> Table 12.

			<p>The programme&apos;s impact on the islands&apos; economy becomes more evident if compared with the main<lb/> ETEAN loan programme which is also funded by the Entrepreneurship Fund. The Business Restarting<lb/> Programme started 3 months earlier than the Island Tourism Entrepreneurship programme and as of 10<lb/></p>

			<p>October 2016 had produced 5 448 approved applications (<ref type="table">Table 13</ref>). This is a general entrepreneurship<lb/> programme and is not directed only towards one sector of the economy. Another significant difference is<lb/> that eligible SMEs are micro, small and medium businesses based all over Greece and not just in one<lb/> specific area, as is the case with Island Tourism Entrepreneurship, which is directed only to micro and<lb/> small SMEs on islands. Considering that the islands&apos; account for about 14% of the total population of<lb/> Greece, this gives another indication of the success of the programme. Finally, the significance of the<lb/> Island Tourism Entrepreneurship for the small, underprivileged and remote islands of Greece, whose<lb/> importance is not just economic and geographical but also political and geostrategic, should be underlined.<lb/> According to ETEAN data, 172 approved loans came from islands with a population less than 3 000<lb/> people, but, in reality most of those islands have populations of less than 200-300 permanent residents.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>The programme&apos;s progress to date has been positive. Critical to this success has been the following:<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· ETEAN&apos;s decision to co-invest with each approved business, instead of the banks.<lb/> ï‚· Flexible application process through the use of banks&apos; networks throughout the Greek islands.<lb/> ï‚· Elimination of bureaucracy mainly through the simplicity of the application form.<lb/> ï‚· Fast approval/rejection process performed by ETEAN.<lb/> ï‚· Low interest rate charged by ETEAN (2.8%) which in the case of small islands becomes 0%.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The programme is due to end on 31 January 2017, extended (3 times) from the original end date of 31<lb/> December 2015. ETEAN is already planning for a new substitute programme. Lessons learnt and critical<lb/> success factors from the existing programme are being taken under consideration as the new programme<lb/> must be characterised by precise effectiveness. Another important factor of influence however is the<lb/> anticipated ending of the financial crisis in Greece. Should the banking sector recover and be in a position<lb/> to provide capital to island SMEs, then ETEAN will have a strong partner and more funding will be<lb/> available through loans to the island SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The intention of ETEAN for the new programme is to allow SMEs from all sectors of the economy to<lb/> be eligible for application. Greek islands are relatively small in size and population and their economy is<lb/> based overwhelmingly on tourism, which means that in practice all island SMEs contribute to the total<lb/> tourist product. In the existing programme only SMEs with strictly tourism activity are eligible, thus a<lb/> hotel for example was eligible but not its food supplier or its waste-collecting contractor. In practice<lb/> however both the food supplier and the waste company&apos;s customers are tourism businesses. ETEAN has<lb/> concluded that as the overwhelming majority of the islands economies are based on tourism, activities both<lb/> directly and indirectly related tourism should have access to the new programme. In this way all sectors of<lb/> the islands&apos; economy will be supported equally and on the same terms, as every entrepreneur contribute to<lb/> the final tourism product. Another issue which will change is the maximum limit of the loan amount,<lb/> which will be finalised after a more in depth analysis of the target SMEs, but it will probably double to<lb/> reach EUR 60 000, covering in this way a much larger variety of SME needs.<lb/> Greece states lack of finance as main constraint, not specific products for tourism SMEs, and<lb/> European funds for innovative firms. Bridging innovation, clusters and start-ups with the national tourism<lb/> market is the main focus of discussions nowadays.<lb/></p>

Moreover, for businesses on islands with a population of less than 3 100 people,<lb/> loans are interest free, whereas businesses on larger islands are charged a fixed interest rate of 2.8%.<lb/> Management fees for all loans are covered by ETEAN SA. Co-investment ensures commitment from the<lb/> part of the entrepreneurs, while banking system provides non-financial support.<lb/> Seasonality in the repayment instalments, where in low-season periods only the interests are due and<lb/> in high-season periods both interest and principal are repaid, helps small firms with irregular cash flows,<lb/> low management and financial skills, and diminishes the use of overdrafts facilities to pay for day-to-day<lb/> activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>New Zealand: Legislative changes to support peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding<lb/> Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2014, New Zealand implemented legislative changes as part of broader reforms to New Zealand<lb/> securities law. The changes included the introduction of peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding to<lb/> the country&apos;s capital market (Box 12). These innovative and relatively new forms of financing approaches<lb/> provide businesses (including tourism businesses) and individuals with a simple, low-cost way to raise<lb/> capital from investors.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rationale for these legislative changes is to broaden the range of financial instruments to support<lb/> SMEs, under the implicit assumption that lack of finance is mainly a supply-side problem (lack of<lb/> availability of funds). Small and medium-sized enterprises play a vital role in driving New Zealand&apos;s<lb/> economic growth. They make up approximately 99% of all businesses in the country (equating to 559 300<lb/> businesses) and employ approximately 70% of the workforce. The majority of tourism businesses are<lb/> SMEs. Ensuring that these SMEs have access to capital is important for the tourism industry, and the<lb/> overall growth of the economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 12. Typical features of equity crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending in New Zealand<lb/> Equity crowdfunding:<lb/></head>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> Registered businesses can raise up to NZD 2 million per year.<lb/> ï‚·<lb/> No investment caps or limits for investors. This is designed to enable investment from larger investors,<lb/> such as angel investors or institutions, and has played a key part in the success of crowdfunding offers.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> No restrictions or eligibility criteria for the size or type of businesses that can raise funds. This has enabled<lb/> a wide range of firms to raise capital using the schemes.<lb/> ï‚·<lb/> Disclosure to consumers is streamlined, reducing the compliance costs for firms looking to raise capital.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> Crowdfunding platforms must include a prescribed statement warning investors of the risks on their<lb/> website.<lb/></p>

			<head>Peer-to-peer lending:<lb/></head>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> Individuals and registered businesses can borrow up to NZD 2 million per year.<lb/> ï‚·<lb/> No investment caps or limits for investors.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> Peer-to-peer lending platforms must have processes in place to ensure that borrowers are creditworthy,<lb/> and policies and systems to deal with disputes. Platforms are also required to have contingency plans to<lb/> deal with large scale defaults or the collapse of the platform itself.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> Platforms can determine many of the features of the lending service they provide, including whether loans<lb/> are secured or unsecured, how fees are structured, and what repayment periods are offered.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> Some platforms also offer additional features such as payment protection insurance. Interest rates are<lb/> often set by negotiation through matching by the borrower and investor, or by the platform based on the<lb/> perceived credit risk of the borrower.<lb/></p>

			<p>ï‚·<lb/> This flexibility has enabled a range of lending models to develop across the four licensed peer-to-peer<lb/> lenders. The average interest rates charged by these lenders ranges from 8.7% to 17.7% per annum.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>Peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding have been around for more than 10 years. The use of<lb/> these instruments is well developed in China and the United Kingdom, for example. In New Zealand, the<lb/> development of these financing approaches was restricted for a long time by disclosure requirements that<lb/> made small-scale public financing uneconomical in the country. The implementation of the Financial<lb/> Markets Conduct Act 2013 provided the legislative framework required to introduce peer-to-peer lending<lb/> and crowdfunding into New Zealand&apos;s capital markets. A key objective of the Act was to provide New<lb/> Zealand SMEs with easier and less costly ways to access capital.<lb/> Equity crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending now supplement traditional sources of financing<lb/> approaches in New Zealand, such as investments from family or friends and banking services, and existing<lb/> sources of growth capital, such as angel and venture capital investments. Peer-to-peer lending and<lb/> crowdfunding are considered risky but they are also useful in that they make it easier for retail companies<lb/> and financial institutions to invest in developing SMEs.<lb/> The Act was implemented and reform of New Zealand&apos;s capital markets took place in 2014. Market<lb/> conditions were significantly improved with the introduction of licensing requirements for equity<lb/> crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending firms, which were overseen by New Zealand&apos;s capital markets<lb/> regulator, the Financial Markets Authority. Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding services are now<lb/> provided by privately-run firms (&apos;platforms&apos;) licensed by the regulator. Platforms are a mediation service<lb/> operating online to facilitate the matching of capital between investors and borrowers. They ensure that<lb/> those accessing the schemes comply with New Zealand law and the rules stipulated in the websites. As at<lb/> February 2016, there were four licensed peer-to-peer lenders and eight licensed crowdfunding platforms<lb/> operating in New Zealand.<lb/> The Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 was carefully designed to provide flexibility for platforms,<lb/> investors and borrowers. Both regimes were designed to be available to a wide range of investors and firms<lb/> or individuals looking to raise capital. While certain requirements have been put in place to minimise risks<lb/> for investors, peer-to-peer or crowdfunding providers still have significant operating freedom.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key results<lb/></head>

			<p>While these forms of capital raising are a relatively new feature of New Zealand&apos;s capital markets,<lb/> they have had a positive impact by deepening capital markets and improving the flow of growth capital to<lb/> New Zealand SMEs (<ref type="table">Table 14</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Equity crowdfunding<lb/></head>

			<p>As at February 2016, 44 offers have been completed on New Zealand&apos;s eight licensed equity<lb/> crowdfunding platforms. The supply of crowdfunding opportunities has been met by strong demand from<lb/> retail and institutional investors. Of the 44 opportunities, 29 were successful in being funded, or fully<lb/> funded, and were able to keep and use the capital raised. These 29 successful opportunities raised nearly<lb/> NZD 18.8 million in crowd-sourced capital. The median amount of capital raised through equity<lb/> crowdfunding is NZD 470 000. This capital has been applied to a range of uses including funding research<lb/> and development, employing more staff, or securing patents.<lb/> A wide range of newer businesses have raised money using New Zealand&apos;s crowdfunding regimes,<lb/> including small food and beverage firms, high-tech start-ups, investment funds and a motion picture.<lb/></p>

			<p>In particular, one tourism firm has successfully used equity crowdfunding to raise capital. Founded in<lb/> 2008, TRNZ Digital Travel Guides offers a GPS-based tour guide audio app. The firm is a leader in the<lb/> field and sought capital through crowdfunding with the purpose of expanding the local sales force,<lb/> updating the website and making it available in multiple languages, and preparing the business for<lb/> expansion into the Australian market. The company exceeded its minimum funding target and raised<lb/> NZD 211 000 to fund this growth project.<lb/></p>

			<p>The website Pledgme (www.pledgeme.co.nz) features another equity campaign (H2Explore Ltd) that<lb/> was unsuccessful in raising the desired NZD 300 000, reaching only NZD 12 000 by the required time. The<lb/> campaign had sought to raise the outstanding financing needed to establish and launch a water transport<lb/> service for cyclists on New Zealand&apos;s Alps 2 Ocean Cycle Trail. The project had already secured a bank<lb/> loan for 65% of the set up costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Peer-to-peer lending:<lb/></head>

			<p>The success of peer-to-peer lending is harder to quantify given that lending and borrowing<lb/> transactions are not disclosed publicly, as is the case with equity crowdfunding. New Zealand&apos;s first<lb/> licensed peer-to-peer lender, Harmoney (www.harmoney.co.nz), has lent around NZD 190 million to<lb/> 13 000 borrowers since it launched in September 2014. Around 75% of this lending has been funded by<lb/> institutional investors, including major banks.<lb/> Peer-to-peer lending has been used for a wide range of reasons: most commonly debt consolidation or<lb/> home improvement by individual borrowers. It is becoming more popular with SMEs â€“ two licensed<lb/> platforms now explicitly target lending to SMEs.<lb/> The Pledgeme crowdfunding platform also offers peer-to-peer funding opportunities and features four<lb/> successfully funded tourism-related projects, targeting funds from NZD 2 500 to NZD 3 000, with a total<lb/> of seven ongoing tourism-related projects seeking funds at time of writing.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>While these new forms of capital are yet to be formally evaluated, the evidence suggests that both<lb/> peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding improve the availability of capital to SMEs, including<lb/> tourism businesses. Stakeholders have generally been supportive of the introduction of these sources of<lb/> capital, particularly the flexibility of the current regimes. For equity crowdfunding, an emerging challenge<lb/> is the lack of a secondary market for the buying and selling of shares in crowdfunded firms. A secondary<lb/> market would improve the liquidity of these investments, and enable investors to easily sell their shares if<lb/> needed. However, one crowdfunding platform, Equitise (www.equitise.com), announced its intention to<lb/></p>

			<head>Portugal: Incubation programme to foster entrepreneurship and innovation in tourism<lb/> Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite some progress, SMEs in Portugal continue to face structural challenges which are negatively<lb/> impacting economic recovery. Demand-side conditions affecting financing for tourism and other SMEs<lb/> include a lack of internal funds to conduct innovation projects, difficulties in obtaining external funding,<lb/> and a deficit in the supply of seed capital. A lack of skills and human resources, organisational<lb/> competencies and business knowledge also hinder the identification of innovative opportunities by<lb/> Portuguese SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tourism businesses are also frequently perceived as high-risk by the banking system and other<lb/> funders, while the appetite for genuine innovation and creation of new products is also reported to be weak.<lb/> Building a culture of entrepreneurship based on knowledge and innovation is thus a major focus of policy<lb/> in Portugal. This includes easing the path for innovative entrepreneurs to access external funds and<lb/> supporting the investment in entrepreneurial talent.<lb/> Within this framework, the Portuguese Tourism Board (Turismo de Portugal) has established several<lb/> partnerships and initiatives focused on entrepreneurship and innovation, to facilitate direct interactions<lb/> between start-ups and potential investors. One of those initiatives is the Lisbon Challenge, which is an<lb/> incubation or horizontal acceleration programme that offers participants a package of supports designed to<lb/> help internationalise, including workshops and mentoring sessions. The programme targets international<lb/> tech start-ups in prototype or product phase from all sectors, including tourism. Inspired by the<lb/> MassChallenge programme from Boston, the Lisbon Challenge aims to offer consistent methods and<lb/> resources for start-up acceleration. It was named the 4th most dynamic European accelerator by Fundacity,<lb/> which connects entrepreneurs and investors around the world.<lb/> Participants in the Lisbon Challenge compete for the chance to meet with 200 international mentors<lb/> and investors, as well as participate in workshops, pitch sessions and networking events. The programme<lb/> concludes with a Demo Day/Investors Day, where the best start-ups get the chance to pitch and demo to a<lb/> crowd of investors, partners and other start-ups. Following this, selected teams get a chance to go on a<lb/> roadshow to London and San Francisco. The overall goal of the Lisbon Challenge is to make Portugal an<lb/> entrepreneurial hub and a world-class environment in which to develop entrepreneurial skills and create<lb/> high quality business start-ups. It takes place in Lisbon, which was named European Entrepreneurial<lb/> Region in 2015 and is considered to be the 5 th most upcoming tech hub worldwide by Entrepreneur<lb/> magazine.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, Tourism Day is a sector-specific initiative held in the context of Lisbon Challenge. This<lb/> event is dedicated to the tourism industry and focuses on tech based start-ups with tourism-related activity,<lb/> where top players come together to discuss the tech trends in tourism. The goal of Tourism Day is to<lb/> support the renewal of the business framework and generate opportunities for the development of<lb/> innovative businesses in the tourism sector, in order to encourage the creation of companies with high<lb/> added value and global growth potential. It also aims to support new practices of innovation among actors<lb/> so as to differentiate the tourism offer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance instruments offered<lb/></head>

			<p>The Lisbon Challenge and Tourism Day initiative is primarily designed to stimulate and promote a<lb/> national spirit and culture of entrepreneurship and innovation within the tourism sector. Through the<lb/> creation of an appropriate environment for high quality entrepreneurial ventures, it encourages innovation<lb/> in the tourism sector, promotes Portugal as a location for international start-ups, and increases access to<lb/> finance, enabling start-ups to exploit financing opportunities. Entrepreneurs are empowered by a<lb/> combination of methodologies, tools, network and a mind-shifting experience.<lb/> The Portuguese public sector offers complementary finance services to those start-ups that have been<lb/> deemed as successful and potentially viable by the incubator. The finance options include equity and debt<lb/> financing at preferential conditions (<ref type="table">Table 15</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Portugal Ventures is a venture capital institution, focusing its investments in innovative, scientific and<lb/> technology-based companies as well as in companies from the more traditional Portuguese tourism and<lb/> industrial sectors, with significant competitive advantages and export oriented to global markets. Portugal<lb/> Ventures works alongside entrepreneurs, enabling high-growth Portuguese companies to achieve global<lb/> status. Several start-ups that participated in Lisbon Challenge were financed through Portugal Ventures call<lb/> for entrepreneurship. Between 2014-15, around EUR 5 million was invested in tourism start-ups, most of<lb/> which were identified through the Lisbon Challenge and other local acceleration programmes<lb/> (Guestcentric, iClio/JiTT, Skaphandrus, Fairway, GuestU, Invine, Mygon, BGuest, StoryTrail, Indie<lb/> Campers, StoryO).<lb/> Under the Portugal 2020 strategic framework, incentive schemes financed by EU Structural Funds<lb/> support SME projects in all economic activities, particularly promoting business innovation at the<lb/> company level and entrepreneurship. These public instruments illustrate the crucial role SMEs and<lb/> entrepreneurs play in the economy, and reflect public policies that recognise the importance of direct<lb/> incentives in order to encourage corporate investment that enables the incorporation of competitiveness<lb/> factors in SME business models.<lb/> Through the Bank Protocols Regime, banks meet the specialised needs of tourism SMEs, providing<lb/> financial services tailored to their needs. By working as partners of the Portuguese Tourism Board, banks<lb/> can reduce risks and costs, and provide financial support to economically and financially viable tourism<lb/> projects. This approach introduced an alternative model of financing and has been succeeding in pushing<lb/> banks to deliver financing to tourism SMEs. Different credit lines provide different solutions for different<lb/> needs, supporting entrepreneurship, qualification of the tourism offer and the financial consolidation of the<lb/> companies.<lb/> Tourism SMEs can also access the SME Growth 2015 credit line, which facilitates access to credit for<lb/> businesses in the tourism sector through interest rates subsidies and guarantee mechanisms within the<lb/> national guarantee system. This credit line offers long-term maturities and preferential conditions through<lb/> partially subsidised interest rates and risk-sharing public guarantees.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>The Lisbon Challenge and Tourism Day programme results from a partnership between the<lb/> Portuguese Tourism Board, which is the central public authority responsible for the promotion,<lb/> enhancement and sustainability of tourism activities, and Beta-i, which it is a non-profit organisation<lb/> created in 2010 whose mission is to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. It does this through four<lb/> axes: create and foster a culture and network of entrepreneurship and innovation through events and<lb/> programmes; accelerate start-ups with global ambition and facilitate access to investment; create spaces,<lb/> services and products focused on the entrepreneur; and promote innovation and entrepreneurship within<lb/> large organisations. Beta-i is considered the biggest start-up promoter in Portugal by the European<lb/> Enterprise Promotion Awards.<lb/> The goal of the partnership is to support a network of entrepreneurs and investors, and create a culture<lb/> of entrepreneurship and innovation in the Lisbon ecosystem by attracting entrepreneurs and key players<lb/> from around the world to interact and participate in the local community and to gather experience and<lb/> advice.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The Lisbon Challenges featured two editions in 2015:<lb/> ï‚· Spring edition: Lisbon Challenge from March to June, with Tourism Day in May,<lb/> ï‚· Autumn Edition: Lisbon Challenge from September to December, with Tourism Day in<lb/> November.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Key results<lb/></head>

			<figure>From a total investment of EUR 1 million, the Portuguese Tourism Board contributed EUR 80 000.<lb/> The programme has received 570 applications, 74% of which were from international start-ups from 57<lb/> different countries. A total of 42 start-ups have participated in 48 workshops and 1 145 mentoring sessions;<lb/> 59.5% of these start-ups were international, from 14 countries.<lb/> Tourism start-ups represent between 30-40% of all start-ups participating in the Lisbon Challenge. In<lb/> the Spring 2014 edition, 10 of the 29 participating start-ups were tourism start-ups. The overall winner was<lb/> a tourism start-up, Mougli, while 3 tourism start-ups placed in the Top 10. In the Autumn 2014 edition, 10<lb/> of the 22 participating start-ups were tourism start-ups; again, 3 tourism start-ups placed in the Top 10. In<lb/> the Spring 2015 edition, 9 tourism start-ups from a total of 22 participated, while in Autumn 2015, 8<lb/> tourism start-ups were involved, from a total of 20 start-ups (Table 16).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>Building on the success of this horizontal acceleration programme, a tourism vertical Discoveries<lb/> programme was launched in 2015 by the Portuguese Tourism Board, FÃ¡brica de Start-ups, a non-profit<lb/> organisation focused on the promotion of entrepreneurship, and NOS, a large communication and<lb/> entertainment group. The 2015 edition had 122 applications and 17 start-ups were selected to participate.<lb/> The main objective is to connect tourism start-ups in the programme with institutional investors and<lb/> venture capitalists. The creation of a network of investors and international events is currently envisaged.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conditions for transferability<lb/></head>

			<p>The Lisbon Challenge and Tourism Day is an initiative focusing on those innovative projects in the<lb/> technology domain of the tourism sector. Lisbon is a city with a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem; the<lb/> transfer to other cities not as focused on fostering innovative entrepreneurial projects will not foresee the<lb/> same success.<lb/> This idea is different from the France incubator programme, which focuses on innovation along a<lb/> diverse stream of tourism activities (including tech products but also innovation in services).<lb/></p>

			<head>Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>Fostering innovation in the tourism sector has a long history in Slovenia. Public awards for creative<lb/> tourism achievements have been in place since 2004. The idea evolved to the creation of a database for the<lb/> sharing of innovative tourism ideas in 2009, building synergies between the government, industry and<lb/> academia (so-called triple helix) to support knowledge sharing and diffusion of new ideas.<lb/></p>

			<p>Innovation has always been an important part of tourism. Tourism enterprises constantly seek new<lb/> ideas, solutions, products and services, to enrich the experience of their guests. The Slovenian Tourism<lb/> Board, together with its partners, recognised and emphasised the importance of innovation in tourism<lb/> sector in four progressive steps:<lb/></p>

			<figure>ï‚· 2004: Sejalec (&quot;Sower&quot;) award for creative and innovative tourism achievements.<lb/> ï‚· 2006: Creation of a database for the exchange of tourism related ideas, energies and knowledge,<lb/> the Bank of Tourism Potentials in Slovenia.<lb/> ï‚· 2009: Snovalec (&quot;Creator&quot;) financial support for best creative and innovative tourism ideas.<lb/> ï‚· 2012: T-Lab Snovalec mentoring scheme .<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Snovalec and T-lab Snovalec mechanisms represent one of many layers of a unique and evolving<lb/> environment that is supporting tourism innovation in Slovenia. The two national mechanisms foster the<lb/> successful realisation and promotion of most promising tourism ideas and integrate the inputs and outputs<lb/> from these mechanisms into the wider national research, development and marketing scheme.<lb/> The Bank of Tourism Potentials in Slovenia was established to further stimulate the successful<lb/> implementation of new tourism ideas and strengthen the brand of the initial Sejalec call. It is a joint<lb/> partnership between the Slovenian Tourist Board, the Ministry of Economic Development and<lb/> Technology, and the Faculty of Tourism Studies at the University of Primorska. The initiative promotes the<lb/> exchange of ideas, means for their realisation, and related knowledge through several channels and<lb/> activities.<lb/> Snovalec was launched in 2009 to spur creativity and innovation in tourism by funding inventions that<lb/> will eventually grow into tourism innovations, which could (when realised) apply also for the Sejalec call.<lb/> The initiative received financial support from the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology in<lb/> the form of a grant for EUR 40 000, to be distributed among the best ideas.<lb/> Experience gathered during the first three years showed that financing was not the only support<lb/> needed by the most frequent beneficiaries of the call: SMEs, young entrepreneurs and future entrepreneurs.<lb/> Other, sometimes more useful, types of incentive were mentoring, sharing of experience, networking and<lb/> (inter)national promotion of the finalists and winners. In 2012 an opportunity arose in the frame of the EU<lb/> funded project T-lab -Laboratory of Tourism Potentials -made it possible to test a modified version of the<lb/> Snovalec call, T-lab Snovalec. Rather than providing direct financial support, T-lab Snovalec provided the<lb/> best ideas with knowledge and experience sharing between senior mentors (entrepreneurs, academics,<lb/> experts) and the selected mentees.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial instruments offered<lb/></head>

			<p>The Snovalec financial instrument consists of grants to each successful tourism project (<ref type="table">Table 17</ref>).<lb/> These are awarded ex-post tourism innovation, once the idea has been developed.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 17.

			<p>Applications for Snovalec are not limited in terms of firm size, gender, age or type of activity, but are<lb/> limited in terms of location of the product -the invention needs to be implemented in or for Slovenia&apos;s<lb/> tourism sector. Based on the grant available and the winning proposition, a decision is made on actual<lb/> number and amount of awards. On average, 3-4 contracts are signed for amounts of between EUR 5 000-<lb/>EUR 10 000. Winners only receive money once they have successfully implemented the idea. In order to<lb/> assess this, evidence needs to be presented to prove that the final product/service reflects the idea that was<lb/> presented and awarded, and the contractual funds were actually spent.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2012 and 2013 the Snovalec call was not published due to lack of funds. However, it was<lb/> substituted by the T-lab Snovalec which was mainly financed through an EU project T-lab -Laboratory of<lb/> Tourism Potentials (EU funding, http://www.ita-slo.eu/eng/). T-lab was a Slovenia to Italy good practice<lb/> transfer of the acknowledged BTPS project, one of the four major evolution steps in the Slovenia&apos;s history<lb/> of the promotion of tourism innovation. EU funds were not spent directly to financially support the winners<lb/> but indirectly, to provide the winners with professional support, networking and advice. The goal was to<lb/> implement the collaborative business development research, plans and reports, resulting in the thorough<lb/> marketing and/or business plans. The mentoring processes and outputs were assessed by T-lab Snovalec<lb/> project co-ordinators, and funds were paid to the mentors after the successful completion. Mentees did not<lb/> receive any direct financial support.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>Snovalec is a joint call of two public bodies, the Tourism and Internationalisation Directorate at the<lb/> Ministry of Economic Development and Technology and the Slovenian Tourist Board. It is co-ordinated<lb/> and implemented by the New Tourism Institute (Novi Turizem Institute), a private institute specialised in<lb/> tourism innovation that has been a long-term partner and external service provider in this field.<lb/></p>

			<p>The annual Snovalec call for tourism innovative proposals is devised as a multi-step selection<lb/> procedure. The call is usually published in February/March each year, with the winners announced in May<lb/> and funds paid in November after ideas have been implemented. Applicants are invited to submit their<lb/> ideas online through the Bank of Tourism Potentials webpage. The quality of ideas is then assessed by an<lb/> expert jury, based on several innovation and sustainability criteria. Finalists are invited to present the idea<lb/> to the jury in person, and the best ideas receive a contract. However, the contract is not a guarantee that a<lb/> grant would actually be paid out; this is contingent on the product being implemented and in line with the<lb/> idea proposed in the application. The amount of the money received by the winners depends on the<lb/> outcome of an evaluation of the final project.<lb/> The T-lab Snovalec call was published in 2012 and 2013 in the frame of the EU co-founded T-lab<lb/> project. It was implemented by two public bodies, the Public Agency for Entrepreneurship,<lb/> Internationalisation, Foreign Investments and Technology, SPIRIT Slovenia, and the Faculty of Tourism<lb/> Studies at the University of Primorska. It was devised a bit differently and consisted of two calls; one<lb/> looking for mentors with experience in tourism, another looking for mentees with the best tourism ideas. A<lb/> match-making event was organised where mentors and mentees met in order to assess each other&apos;s<lb/> competences and allow optimal mentor-mentee pairs to be formed later in the process. Mentors also voted<lb/> for the best ideas. Proposers of the best ideas did not receive any financial support but mentoring, advice,<lb/> and advanced networking opportunities. The goal was to jointly develop and test proper idea realisation<lb/> steps. To ensure the co-operation among mentors and mentees went well, detailed on-going monitoring of<lb/> the working process and outputs was organised.<lb/> The main and only source of funding of Snovalec call is public, from the Tourism and<lb/> Internationalisation Directorate of the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology in co-operation<lb/> with the Slovenian Tourist Board. The total grant amount has varied from EUR 40 000 annually from<lb/> 2009-11 to EUR 15 000 annually from 2014-16.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key results<lb/></head>

			<p>Snovalec annual costs currently amount to approximately EUR 20 000 per year. This consists of:<lb/> direct costs of EUR 15 000 gross in the three years to 2016 (EUR 40 000 in years 2009-11); and indirect<lb/> costs, including the cost of co-ordination (EUR 3 500 per year), expert jury (EUR 1 000 per year), and<lb/> promotion and marketing material (EUR 1 000 per year). The five Snovalec calls to date have received 271<lb/> applications in total. Of these, 18 were selected for financing (average of 3-4 per year) and 15 successfully<lb/> received funds (meaning that 3 did not fulfil the expert jury&apos;s expectations). In total, EUR 108 000 was<lb/> paid as a grants, supported by MEDT and STB funds (<ref type="table">Table 18</ref>).<lb/> T-lab Snovalec annual cost amounted to EUR 20 000 per year. This consisted of mentors fees<lb/> (EUR 10 000) and monitoring and co-ordination fees (EUR 10 000 per year). During two T-lab Snovalec<lb/> calls, 82 applications were received, 16 of which were supported in the mentoring scheme. All were<lb/> successfully implemented, meaning all funds were drawn down.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>As the data shows, fewer than 7% of Snovalec applicants receive funding, while around 20% of T-lab<lb/> Snovalec applicants were successful. One can claim that target beneficiaries&apos; demand exceeds supply.<lb/> However, not all proposed ideas were ready to enter the implementation phase. Approximately half of<lb/> applications would need additional workshops and external knowledge to refine the proposal and develop<lb/> implementation plans for the ideas, before being eligible.<lb/> A study by the Slovenia Tourist Board (<ref type="biblio">November 2015</ref>) found that the Snovalec call was perceived<lb/> as the most important measure supporting tourism innovation promotion in Slovenia (followed by Sejalec<lb/> call and the Bank of Tourism Potentials crowdsourcing challenges). The main challenge to the<lb/> development of new tourism products was the financing of research and development and new products<lb/> marketing activities, followed by networking issues and efficient identification/understanding of relevant<lb/> customer segments.<lb/> Nevertheless, the Slovenian experience shows that pure financing is just a part of a bigger equation<lb/> for addressing the needs of interdisciplinary and interconnected set of tourism players. Tourism providers<lb/> (SMEs and others) play many different roles, and demonstrate different knowledge levels and needs. Based<lb/> on the Snovalec experience, different tourism development supporting services are required for different<lb/> types of tourism SMEs and their needs. Most, if not all, of these supports will have to include the<lb/> financing. However, to have the desired and wholesome realisation and business effect, these to be<lb/> performed hand in hand with (inter)national promotion, collaboration and learning related supporting<lb/> activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Switzerland: Public-private financing partnership for hostel and public spa facility in Saas Fee<lb/> Description and rationale<lb/></head>

			<p>In many tourism destinations, land is scarce and when available, expensive. An initiative in<lb/> Switzerland provides an example of a successful partnership between the public and private sector to<lb/> overcome the issue of land costs with an innovative solution based on accumulating synergies. The public<lb/> spa facility located in the alpine resort village of Saas Fee was in need of renovation, but the project was<lb/> not economically viable. At the same time, a private organisation was looking for an affordable option to<lb/> build a youth hostel, which was also economically unviable on its own.<lb/> A joint solution was thus envisaged: to build the private youth hostel, WellnessHostel4000, on the<lb/> roof of the existing public spa facility, Aqua Allalin. This reduced the investment costs for the youth<lb/> hostel, which did not need to pay for the land. Operational costs were also reduced through the sharing of<lb/> facilities and employees, further closing the financial gap for both institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The joint construction of the hostel and the refurbishment and operation of the public swimming pool<lb/> enabled both parties to successfully lower investment costs and create operational synergies through a<lb/> public-private partnership. The addition of a hostel significantly improved staffing in the leisure facility at<lb/> minimum cost. It was also possible to improve service quality levels while keeping costs low, for example<lb/> through opening times for reception, hospitality provided by youth hostel, and range of leisure activities<lb/> available.<lb/> Public sport and leisure facilities rarely cover their own costs, and the idea of combining a youth<lb/> hostel with leisure facilities is not new in itself. The innovation implemented in Saas Fee was to jointly<lb/> develop a public-private partnership to optimise land use and reduce investment and operational costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financing instrument<lb/></head>

			<p>The joint construction of the hostel and wellness spa was financed with individual bank loans, own<lb/> funds and a public contribution of CHF 2.5 million. The hostel loan amounted to CHF 3.5 million; the spa<lb/> facility loan amounted to CHF 4.5 million (<ref type="biblio">Table 19</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 19. Financing the public-private hostel and spa facility in Saas Fee Switzerland<lb/> Financing source<lb/> Value<lb/> WellnessHostel4000<lb/> Own funds and contribution from the Swiss Foundation for Social Tourism<lb/> CHF 3.6 million<lb/> Loans from the Swiss Society for Hotel Credit<lb/> CHF 2.0 million<lb/> Investment aid loan from the Canton of Wallis / New Regional Policy<lb/> CHF 1.0 million<lb/> Bank loans<lb/> CHF 3.5 million<lb/> Total<lb/> CHF 10.1 million<lb/> Aqua Allalin<lb/> Own funds and contributions Citizens&apos; Commune<lb/> CHF 0.8 million<lb/> Investment aid loan from the Canton of Wallis / New Regional Policy<lb/> CHF 1.5 million<lb/> Bank loans<lb/> CHF 4.5 million<lb/> Total<lb/> CHF 6.8 million<lb/></table>

			<p>Public financial support was essential, as commercial banks declined to take increased risks by issuing<lb/> large loans to either the private or public investor and the joint high interest rates would have been<lb/> economically unviable.<lb/></p>

			<p>The biggest savings were made in terms of personnel costs due to the combined use and operation of<lb/> the reception (working hours) and kitchen, and performance of cleaning, maintenance and administration<lb/> activities. The exact resulting financial synergies were not determined as this was of only minor<lb/> importance. The deciding factor was the conviction that both parties would automatically achieve optimum<lb/> performance through the ideal combination of the tasks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>To make the joint project financially viable, the spa facility and the youth hostel had to harmonise and<lb/> jointly re-design the individual development plans. The joint proposal was put to public voting for<lb/> validation, as the Citizen&apos;s Commune is the owner of the public spa facility. Once approved, a joint public-<lb/>private construction commission was set up to develop and implement both construction projects. The<lb/> private founding body has the right to construct (Baurechtsnehmer) on the land, and is the builder of the<lb/> new hostel and tenant of Aqua Allalin. It is responsible for operating the private wellness hostel and the<lb/> public spa facility. The Citizen&apos;s Commune issued the building permit for the new hostel and is the builder<lb/> of the spa facility, which it leases to the private partner.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of logistics, co-ordination was achieved through a superordinated meeting structure, which<lb/> dealt with different topics in each meeting including communication, financing and operational issue.</p>

			<figure>Both<lb/> partners had equal rights and representation in all committees. To provide mutual guarantees, simple<lb/> phase-related contractual agreements were concluded from the beginning of the project. These included the<lb/> letter of interest, building rights and lease agreements, and operating commission regulations. The project<lb/> planning process started in June 2009. Construction work commenced in April 2013. The premises were<lb/> put into operation in September 2014, after a 17-month construction period.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The specific project structure made it possible to offer a low-budget hostel and wellness facilities<lb/> under one roof. Saas Fee is good practice model of public sports and leisure facilities for other tourist<lb/> destinations. Many (Alpine) destinations face difficulties when it comes to operating public facilities<lb/> efficiently and professionally, as municipal authorities tend not to be well suited or best placed to provide<lb/> tourism services. However, outsourcing to private companies often fails because of legal and financial<lb/> issues, fundamental differences between the two partners, or simply fear that public money will flow into<lb/> the private sector. The example shows that it can be worth overcoming the difficulties of a private-public<lb/> partnership and thus tap potential that would otherwise be out of reach for all involved.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key results<lb/></head>

			<p>The WellnessHostel4000 and Aqua Allalin project offered strong economic potential. The two sub-<lb/>projects greatly strengthen the competitive position of the destination. The Saas valley received urgently<lb/> required modern and indispensable indoor facilities, especially as in bad weather. The alpine destination<lb/> has a limited offer in this respect.<lb/> Saas Fee also had no youth hostel up to this point and the new low-budget facilities increase the<lb/> destination&apos;s competitive position as it can now close this gap in its hospitality portfolio. The combination<lb/> of both facilities has created the world&apos;s first wellness hostel, further improving the location&apos;s profile and<lb/> acting as its new flagship offer. The two new additions to Saas Fee&apos;s facilities significantly increase the<lb/> location&apos;s market potential. The initiative also created by the two construction projects and additional long-<lb/>term jobs should also be taken into consideration.<lb/></p>

There have also been 120 000 visits per year to the Aqua Allalin. An estimated 32<lb/> new jobs have been created (Table 20).<lb/> In financial terms, the construction costs amounted to CHF 16.9 million. The youth hostel has<lb/> recorded an annual operating income of CHF 2.4 million, while the spa facility has recorded a<lb/> CHF 1.1 million operating income per year. Youth hostel guests and employees have created<lb/> CHF 5.8 million added value per year (excluding internal youth hostel income) from: guests&apos; spending in<lb/> the region (CHF 4.9 million), visitor tax revenues (CHF 80 000), maintenance (CHF 110 000), regional<lb/> purchases (CHF 132 000) and estimated spending of the 12 employees in the region (CHF 525 000).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Lessons learnt<lb/></head>

			<p>The success of the project is based on the accumulation of synergies. The two projects require only<lb/> one parcel of land, which is scarce in many touristic locations. Savings were achieved when constructing<lb/> the foundation, by installing the joint building services and in particularly by saving on floor space,<lb/> through the joint use of facilities including the reception, catering and service areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extremely focused, pragmatic design of the public-private partnership created a considerably<lb/> amount of efficiency. The project structure can be regarded as successful. The absolute equality of both<lb/> partners during the entire project development was probably the key to success. Both partners<lb/> acknowledged that each party must endeavour to create its own ideal conditions. This, in turn, restored the<lb/> public&apos;s trust that the public money was not going to be used to fund a private company and that a private<lb/> company was not being used for implementing an unsupportable project idea whose failed profits would<lb/> have to be subsidised with public money.<lb/> The project has won several awards, underscoring the importance of this innovative idea. These<lb/> include the Milestone 2014 &quot;Outstanding project&quot; category, Watt d&apos;Or 2015 &quot;Buildings and space&quot;<lb/> category and Prix Lignum 2015, Region Mitte.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conditions for transferability<lb/></head>

			<p>The project can be transferable to other regions dealing with the same underlying challenge: lack of<lb/> land for developing tourism projects. By creating synergies and reducing initial investment (once-off) and<lb/> operational costs (continuous), the two projects became financially viable. Further gains were achieved in<lb/> terms of increasing the tourism potential of the area.<lb/> This project is based on a strong commitment from the two parties and relies on strong levels of<lb/> interpersonal and public trust. As a precondition to assess the transferability, the same social capital (public<lb/> trust) that exists in Saas Fee needs to exist in the potential transferable regions. In economic terms, the<lb/> motto of &quot; people respond to incentives &quot; applies, being aware that there are economic reasons for one of the<lb/> parts to unilaterally alter the terms of the agreement, once the other party has shown commitment, unless<lb/> there exist enforceable constraints. The transferability of this funding opportunity thus depends on whether<lb/> the same social capital exists in other regions.<lb/></p>
