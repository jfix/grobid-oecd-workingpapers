			<p>Membership of the European Union has contributed to the economic prosperity of the United Kingdom.<lb/> Uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum has already started to weaken growth in the United<lb/> Kingdom. A UK exit (Brexit) would be a major negative shock to the UK economy, with economic fallout in<lb/> the rest of the OECD, particularly other European countries. In some respects, Brexit would be akin to a<lb/> tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK<lb/> remained in the EU. The shock would be transmitted through several channels that would change<lb/> depending on the time horizon. In the near term, the UK economy would be hit by tighter financial<lb/> conditions and weaker confidence and, after formal exit from the European Union, higher trade barriers<lb/> and an early impact of restrictions on labour mobility. By 2020, GDP would be over 3% smaller than<lb/> otherwise (with continued EU membership), equivalent to a cost per household of GBP 2200 (in today&apos;s<lb/> prices). In the longer term, structural impacts would take hold through the channels of capital, immigration<lb/> and lower technical progress. In particular, labour productivity would be held back by a drop in foreign<lb/> direct investment and a smaller pool of skills. The extent of foregone GDP would increase over time. By<lb/> 2030, in a central scenario GDP would be over 5% lower than otherwise – with the cost of Brexit<lb/> equivalent to GBP 3200 per household (in today&apos;s prices). The effects would be larger in a more<lb/> pessimistic scenario and remain negative even in the optimistic scenario. Brexit would also hold back GDP<lb/> in other European economies, particularly in the near term resulting from heightened uncertainty would<lb/> create about the future of Europe. In contrast, continued UK membership in the European Union and<lb/> further reforms of the Single Market would enhance living standards on both sides of the Channel.<lb/> JEL classification codes: C54, E24, E44, H12<lb/> Keywords: Brexit, European Union, uncertainty, risk premia, confidence, trade, FDI, skills, immigration, deregulation.<lb/></p>

			<table>conséquences économiques du BREXIT : les coûts d&apos;une décision<lb/> L&apos;adhésion à l&apos;Union européenne a contribué à la prospérité économique du Royaume-Uni.<lb/> Les incertitudes entourant l&apos;issue du referendum ont déjà commencé à affaiblir la croissance britannique.<lb/> Une sortie du Royaume-Uni de l&apos;UE (Brexit) conduirait à un choc négatif majeur pour l&apos;économie du pays<lb/> et aurait des incidences pour tous les membres de l&apos;OCDE, en particulier en Europe. Dans une certaine<lb/> mesure, le Brexit équivaudrait à un impôt sur le PIB, imposant un coût durable et croissant sur l&apos;économie,<lb/> qui ne serait pas encouru si Royaume-Uni restait dans l&apos;UE. Ce choc serait transmis par le jeu successif<lb/> de différents canaux. Sur le court terme, l&apos;économie britannique serait affectée par le durcissement des<lb/> conditions financières et l&apos;affaiblissement de la confiance puis, après sa sortie officielle de l&apos;Union<lb/> européenne, par le relèvement des obstacles aux échanges et les conséquences précoces des limitations<lb/> à la mobilité de la main-d&apos;oeuvre. À l&apos;horizon 2020, le PIB serait plus faible de 3 % qu&apos;autrement (en cas de<lb/> maintien dans l&apos;UE), équivalent à un coût moyen de 2250 GBP par foyer (en prix actuels). Sur le plus long<lb/> terme, les effets structurels s&apos;affirmeraient par le biais de trois canaux : les capitaux, l&apos;immigration et un<lb/> progrès technique moindre. En particulier, la productivité du travail serait pénalisée par une baisse de<lb/> l&apos;investissement étranger direct et par l&apos;accès à un volume de compétences plus limité. Le manque<lb/> à gagner en termes de PIB se creuserait avec le temps. En 2030, selon le scénario de référence, le PIB<lb/> serait inférieur de plus 5 % qu&apos;autrement – et le montant de l&apos;« impôt Brexit » atteindrait alors 3200 GBP<lb/> par ménage (en prix actuels). Les conséquences seraient encore plus marquées dans le scénario le plus<lb/> défavorable, et resteraient négatives y compris dans le scénario favorable. Une sortie du Royaume-Uni de<lb/> l&apos;UE entraverait également le PIB dans d&apos;autres économies européennes, notamment sur le court terme,<lb/> en raison des incertitudes politiques sur l&apos;avenir de l&apos;Europe. À l&apos;inverse, un maintien du Royaume-Uni<lb/> dans l&apos;Union européenne et la poursuite des réformes du marché unique amélioreraient les niveaux de vie<lb/> des deux côtés de la Manche.<lb/> Classification JEL : C54, E24, E44, H12<lb/> Mots-clés : Brexit, Union européenne, incertitude, primes de risque, confiance, commerce, IDE, compétences,<lb/> immigration, dérégulation.<lb/> OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016<lb/> The Economic Consequences of Brexit: A Taxing Decision<lb/></table>

			<head>Executive summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Since becoming a member of the European Union (EU) in 1973, GDP per capita in the United<lb/> Kingdom (UK) has doubled, outpacing other affluent non-EU English-speaking countries. The referendum<lb/> on EU membership of 23 June 2016 could lead to a UK exit (Brexit), which would have persistent adverse<lb/> consequences on economic activity in the UK, and would result in negative near-term spillovers elsewhere,<lb/> particularly in the rest of the EU.<lb/> Opinion polls suggest that the outcome of the referendum is particularly uncertain. Financial markets<lb/> have increasingly begun to price in the risk of Brexit. Economic uncertainty has also risen and started to<lb/> hurt confidence and business investment, weakening UK growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Were Brexit to happen, the shock would be transmitted through several channels, the intensity of<lb/> which would depend on policy developments and the time horizon considered. In some respects, Brexit<lb/> would be akin to a tax, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>Near term:</head>

			<p>Brexit is assumed to be followed rapidly by negotiations to withdraw from the EU,<lb/> suggesting the possibility of a formal exit in late-2018. This would be followed by new trade negotiations<lb/> with the EU over 2019-23 and possibly by measures to reduce immigration. The following channels would<lb/> operate:<lb/> • Heightened economic uncertainty would reduce confidence, holding back spending decisions, and<lb/> tighten financial conditions by lifting risk premia, thus increasing the cost of finance and reducing<lb/> its availability.<lb/> • A danger is that large capital outflows, or a break in inflows, might threaten the financing of the<lb/> record-high current account deficit of 7% of GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>• After leaving the EU, the UK would lose unrestricted access to the Single Market, and preferential<lb/> access to 53 non-EU markets. UK trade would then initially be governed by World Trade<lb/> Organisation rules, leading to higher tariffs for goods and to other barriers in accessing the Single<lb/> Market, notably for financial services. Bilateral UK-EU trade would contract.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Concluding a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, similar to the one between the EU and Canada,<lb/> would provide a partial offset for UK trade by 2023. Yet, the costs of accessing the Single Market<lb/> would still be higher than they are now after that time.<lb/> • The UK would also continue to face additional barriers on third-country markets to which<lb/> preferential access was lost as a result of EU exit. Negotiating new trade treaties would take time.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Immigration accounts for one-half of UK GDP growth since 2005, with more than 2 million jobs<lb/> created. Curbs to the free movement of labour from the EU and, more importantly, a weaker UK<lb/> economy after exit, would gradually reduce the incentives for economic migration to the UK and<lb/> would be a cost to the economy.<lb/></p>

			<table>• Brexit would generate a financial shock beyond the UK, magnified by the appreciation of other<lb/> currencies against sterling.<lb/> • By 2020, these effects could shave off over 3 percentage points of UK GDP, with costs equivalent<lb/> to GBP 2200 per household. The GDP loss in the reduced EU would be around 1 percentage<lb/> point.<lb/> Longer term: Brexit would continue to generate substantial structural changes in the economy,<lb/> reflecting the new relationship with the EU and new policies over 2024-30. The following channels would<lb/> materialise:<lb/></table>

			<p>• Access to the Single Market is important for foreign direct investment (FDI). Brexit would cut FDI<lb/> inflows, notably from the EU, resulting in lower UK business investment and a decline in the capital<lb/> stock over time. This, in turn, would negatively weigh on trade, innovation and reduce managerial<lb/> quality.<lb/> • Trade and investment are important drivers of long-term GDP growth. Brexit would result in lower<lb/> openness and innovation, weakening technical progress and productivity in the UK.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Long-term GDP growth would be further reduced through a smaller pool of skills, stemming from<lb/> lower immigration and reduced FDI, reducing managerial quality.<lb/> • The UK labour and product markets are amongst the most flexible in the OECD, which suggests<lb/> that EU regulations are not an important barrier. Nonetheless, it would be possible to pursue<lb/> further regulatory liberalisation, although this would be challenging since regulations are<lb/> comparatively low and the gains would be limited.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Fiscal savings from stopping net transfers to the EU budget are likely to be 0.3-0.4% of GDP per<lb/> year, which is a relatively small amount. Lower GDP growth would weigh on the fiscal position<lb/> significantly, limiting the scope to use the net EU budget savings to relax fiscal policy.<lb/> • By 2030, in a central scenario, UK GDP would be over 5% smaller than if the UK had remained a<lb/> member of the EU. The costs would then be equivalent to GBP 3200 per household (in today&apos;s<lb/> prices). In a more pessimistic scenario these would be even higher, at GBP 5000 per household.<lb/> In the longer term, the impact on the remaining EU countries would be small given the relatively<lb/> low UK share in global trade and the scope for other policies to offset the shock.<lb/> • In addition to the decline in output, the cumulative effects of the different shocks from Brexit also<lb/> reduce the real stock of net assets the UK has available to provide future returns and meet future<lb/> commitments. UK net worth is over 4% below baseline (in today&apos;s prices) by 2030 in the central<lb/> scenario.<lb/></p>

			<p>Alternatively, remaining in the EU, coupled with further reforms of the Single Market, could boost<lb/> trade and foreign direct investment in all EU members, including the UK. The effects would be even larger<lb/> if the EU were to successfully conclude new free trade and investment agreements with the rest of the<lb/> world.<lb/></p>

In January 2013</table>

			<p>, the Prime Minister promised that the UK government would<lb/> negotiate more favourable arrangements for continued membership of the EU, and subsequently hold a<lb/> referendum as to whether the UK should remain in the EU or leave. This commitment was confirmed after<lb/> the Conservative party won a parliamentary majority at the general election in May 2015. The new<lb/> settlement for the UK in the EU was concluded at the European Council meeting of 18-19 February 2016,<lb/> and the referendum was set for 23 June 2016. The agreement covers four areas: economic governance,<lb/> competiveness, sovereignty, and social benefits and free movement of people (Box 1). It includes new opt-<lb/>outs from further integration, and by acknowledging the special status of the UK, it confirms the existing<lb/> differentiated integration of Europe.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 1. Four areas of the new settlement for the United Kingdom in the European Union<lb/> 1) Economic governance: safeguarding the rights and competences of non-euro area countries. Non</figure>

			<p>-euro<lb/> area countries cannot create obstacles to a further deepening of the euro area, but discrimination between countries<lb/> participating in the euro area and those that are not is prohibited, and any difference of treatment must be based &quot; on<lb/> objective reasons &quot; . Legal acts linked to the functioning of the euro area are to respect the internal market, not<lb/> discriminate in trade between member states, and respect the competences, rights and obligations of non-euro area<lb/> countries. Non-euro area countries (and those not participating in the banking union) will not contribute to emergency<lb/> and crisis measures to safeguard the financial stability of the euro. Supervision, regulation and resolution of financial<lb/> institutions and markets of non-euro area countries are a matter of their own authorities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>2) Competitiveness: strengthening the Single Market and taking concrete steps towards better<lb/> regulation. This implies lowering administrative burdens, especially on small and medium sized enterprises, repealing<lb/> unnecessary legislation, and pursuing an ambitious policy on trade. Progress on reaching these objectives will be<lb/> assessed regularly.<lb/> 3) Sovereignty: recognising that the UK is not committed to further political integration into the EU.<lb/> Moreover, if national Parliaments representing a qualified majority of 55% object to a draft legislative act (so-called &quot; red<lb/> card &quot; ), then consideration of such an act should be discontinued (unless the draft is amended to accommodate the<lb/> concerns). The respect of the principle of subsidiarity (which implies that decisions should be taken as closely as<lb/> possible to the citizen) is reinforced.<lb/> 4) Social benefits and free movement of people: responding to exceptional inflows of workers from other<lb/> EU countries. Measures include</figure>

			<p>the creation of a safeguard mechanism (so-called &quot; emergency brake &quot; ), which can be<lb/> invoked when migrant inflows undermine the sustainability of the social security system, create serious and persistent<lb/> difficulties in the job market, or put excessive pressures on public services. In particular, access to in-work benefits<lb/> would be limited for new workers for a total period of up to four years from the start of employment (in a graduated<lb/> way). The duration of the application of this safeguard mechanism is seven years. Other measures to contain<lb/> immigration include the indexation of child benefits to the standard of living in the country where the child resides and<lb/> steps to prevent sham marriages.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Membership in the EU has contributed to the economic prosperity of the UK. Since 1973</figure>

			<p>, when<lb/> the UK joined the EU, UK GDP per capita doubled, increasing more than in other non-EU English speaking<lb/> countries over the same period, including in the United States (US) (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Domestic policies partly<lb/> explain this strong performance, but geographic proximity and unrestricted access to the largest market in<lb/> the world are undeniably important factors as well. For smaller countries with competitive markets the<lb/> benefits could be even larger. For example, Ireland, which also joined the European Union in 1973, had a<lb/> near quadrupling of its GDP per capita.<lb/></p>

			<figure>A multipolar world implies that the UK is economically stronger as an EU member, and in turn<lb/> contributes to the EU strength. Several economic indicators suggest</figure>

			<p>that the global influence and<lb/> bargaining power of the UK are greater when combined with those of other European economies (<ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 2</ref>). The EU has the largest proportion of world GDP and trade, closely followed by the US and China.<lb/> However, after the withdrawal of the UK, the EU share would be smaller than those of the US and China<lb/> for GDP, and behind the US for trade. The UK&apos;s proportion of world GDP is broadly comparable to that of<lb/> Canada and Australia combined, whereas trade is similar to their average. The EU&apos;s shares of global<lb/> population and territory are small, and the UK represents less than 1% of each.<lb/></p>

			<p>in negotiations with the UK. CDS spreads<lb/> remain low relative to the financial crisis period, but their increase since mid-October is significant and<lb/> higher than for peers (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, Panel A). CDS spreads have also edged up in the euro area. For the UK,<lb/> the rise reflects investors&apos; fears rather than a genuine risk of sovereign default following Brexit, given the<lb/> Bank of England&apos;s ability to act as a lender of last resort. Equity prices in the UK and the euro area have<lb/> rebounded less than in the US, but remain resilient as many listed companies are global (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, Panel<lb/> B). Some of the recent weakness in sterling (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, Panel A) could also be attributed to Brexit fears, as<lb/> it appears more depreciated than interest rate differentials and global risk sentiment might suggest. The<lb/> cost of three-month currency options spiked three months before the referendum, on March 23, and<lb/> remains high, implying that investors expect further depreciation in case the referendum would result in<lb/> Brexit (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, Panel B).

			<figure>The EU remains the main trade partner of the UK and the financial sector benefits from direct<lb/> access to the Single Market, which has strengthened the comparative advantage of the City.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Exports to EU countries account for about 12% of UK GDP and about 45% of total UK exports, and for<lb/> imports the EU is even a more important partner (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, Panel A). Some 3 million jobs are linked to<lb/> exports destined for the EU. The UK has a deficit in goods trade vis-à-vis the EU, but a surplus in services<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, Panel B), in particular in financial services. Financial services accounted for 7% of UK output<lb/> and 4% of employment in 2015. Exports of financial services amount to slightly more than 2.5% of GDP for<lb/> the UK, against about 0.5% of GDP in EU peers (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, Panel A). The EU is the destination of some<lb/> 40% of UK financial exports, down from around 50% in 2000. However, the UK financial industry remains<lb/> dependent on the EU market, as the absolute size of UK exports has risen. Indeed, UK overall exports of<lb/> financial services took off in the 2000s (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, Panel B), although statistical changes reduce data<lb/> comparability over time. The EU absorbs around 45% of Swiss exports of financial services, despite the<lb/> absence of passporting rights for its banks (see below), but Switzerland negotiated a favourable<lb/> agreement when it was planning to join the EU in the early 1990s.<lb/></p>

			<p>would ensure free movement of goods, capital, services and people, but the UK<lb/> would have only limited influence on regulation and it would still need to pay contributions to the EU budget<lb/> (its net contribution would probably be halved). This type of partnership has been for smaller countries<lb/> (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The UK could seek a more &quot; symmetric &quot; agreement to reflect its size,<lb/> but Brexit would undermine its bargaining position and other EU countries could be less prone to<lb/> compromise to preserve the unity of the Union. Also, an EEA-type arrangement implies free movement of<lb/> people while the UK after exit would likely seek to have tighter controls in this area (Box 1). Further<lb/> restrictions could possibly be introduced right after formal withdrawal from the EU in late 2018. An<lb/> alternative would be to seek only European Free Trade Association (EFTA) membership, akin to<lb/> Switzerland, but in this case the UK would lose the banking passport which gives access to the EU to its<lb/> banks, it would need to negotiate trade agreements with individual EU countries, and it would still be<lb/> required to abide by EU standards and product regulations. Membership of the EU Customs Union and<lb/> arranging a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU would both reduce access to the Single Market, but<lb/> the UK would still need to comply with a wide range of EU regulations. A &quot; full &quot; Brexit would be consistent<lb/> with independence from EU rules, but access to the Single Market is reduced most when trade is based on<lb/> the MFN regime of the WTO.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Trade between the UK and the EU would become more costly. Administrative costs related to<lb/> customs controls would rise for any of the arrangements with the EU. Compliance costs related to rules of<lb/> origin obligations and conformity assessments would also increase, leading to trade diversion outside the<lb/> EU over time. However, other than for the MFN approach, goods trade would remain relatively barrier free.<lb/> Under MFN rules, maximum-tariffs are applicable on more than 95% of the value of good exports, with an<lb/> average tariff of around 3%, but cars (10%) and tobacco (more than 70%) would face substantially higher<lb/> tariffs. Services are usually exempt from import tariffs, but laws and regulations can (and do) restrict<lb/> access via non-tariff barriers, and the UK would face greater difficulties in exporting financial services to<lb/> Europe.<lb/> Trade agreements with non-EU countries might be less advantageous and take a long time to<lb/> conclude. With formal withdrawal from the EU, the current 36 FTAs of the EU covering 53 non-EU<lb/> countries would no longer be applicable for</figure>

			<p>the UK. New FTAs might be less advantageous than with the<lb/> EU, with the bargaining position of the UK weaker than that of the EU as a whole (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The UK<lb/> would be able to set lower tariffs on some import products, most notably food, which would reduce prices,<lb/> but making this move unilaterally would undermine its negotiating position. The time needed to negotiate<lb/> recent FTAs was at least 3 years (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The overall process could probably take longer than<lb/> negotiations with the EU due to the large number of countries involved, with negative implications on trade,<lb/> and could require additional resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>The aftermath of a vote for leaving the EU would result in considerable<lb/> additional volatility in financial markets and an extended period of uncertainty about future policy<lb/> developments. Moreover, negotiations over UK withdrawal from the EU would need to take place over<lb/> 2016-18, followed by trade negotiations with the EU in 2019-2023, which is likely to contribute to enhanced<lb/> uncertainty for an extended period. Past experience indicates that greater uncertainty, whether reflected in<lb/> the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the UK or greater stock market volatility, would be associated<lb/> with higher corporate bond spreads (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). Uncertainty would also depress asset prices, reduce the<lb/> availability of bank credit and increase its cost for the private sector. A hit to confidence could also lead<lb/> households and businesses to postpone their spending decisions temporarily. These shocks would affect<lb/> the UK and would be transmitted to other countries, mainly in Europe. As the euro area crisis and the<lb/> global financial crisis have shown, adverse financial shocks in one country can quickly spread to others.<lb/></p>

			<head>A substantial shock to trade would start to feed-through from 2019<lb/></head>

			<figure>Even as the initial shock to financial conditions slowly starts to ease, trade would be hit in<lb/> 2019 when the UK is assumed to exit formally from the EU. Departure from</figure>

			<p>the EU would be a source<lb/> of considerable further disruption in the next few years, in itself keeping uncertainty relatively elevated.<lb/> Given the complexity of the task, it is highly unlikely that the current trading arrangements that the UK has<lb/> with the EU, and the countries with which the EU has separate agreements, would have been successfully<lb/> replaced by the end of 2018. Hence, trade with the EU and other countries would initially revert to a WTO<lb/> MFN-basis (Box 2). This would raise the tariff and non-tariff barriers facing UK exporters. In addition, the<lb/> ending of the EU-wide passporting rights of UK-based financial services companies would be a<lb/> considerable extra obstacle. Subsequently, a new FTA with the EU, which is assumed to occur by 2023,<lb/> would reduce the barriers facing UK exporters, but not eliminate them entirely. The reduction in trade<lb/> would not only have a direct negative impact on economic activity, but also hold back the overall economic<lb/> dynamism of the UK economy. Shocks originating in the UK are calibrated (Box 3) and simulated with the<lb/> National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 2. Quantification of trade effects when the United Kingdom formally exits the European Union<lb/> The impact of trade shocks was analysed with the OECD&apos;s METRO model (OECD 2015), assuming two<lb/> distinct stages:<lb/> • When the UK loses preferential access to the EU market, it faces the EU&apos;s Most Favoured Nation<lb/> (MFN) tariffs. The UK, in turn, imposes MFN rates on its imports (assumed to be equal to the EU&apos;s current<lb/> bound MFN rates). Similarly, the UK faces MFN treatment in all other export markets and in turn imposes<lb/> import tariffs. MFN tariffs are approximated using bound rates of the World Trade Organization. This<lb/> underestimates the true amount of border barriers where there are existing import quotas and complex<lb/> mixed tariffs. Trade costs in financial services between the UK and the EU are allowed to increase by 20%,<lb/> which is a conservative assumption as some studies suggest that exports of financial services to the EU<lb/> could fall by half following the loss of passporting rights for banks (Capital Economics, 2016).<lb/> • Subsequently, when the UK negotiates a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU, it goes back to<lb/> the current zero-tariff regime for trade with the EU, but continues to trade with other countries under<lb/> MFN rules as before.</figure>

			<p>Since the UK is no longer capable of influencing EU standards and regulations<lb/> regulatory regimes are likely to diverge over time. This leads to new trade costs on goods, as the UK is<lb/> assumed to achieve only one-half of the cost savings from the common market when concluding the FTA<lb/> with the EU (estimates based on OECD (2011)). The UK would also face rules of origin obligations in a new<lb/> EU-UK FTA. Those are approximated as an increase of export costs equal to 10% of the tariff reductions<lb/> achieved when entering the FTA (following <ref type="biblio">Petri and Plummer, 2016</ref>). In addition, trade costs in financial<lb/> services between the UK and the EU are assumed to drop from 20% to 10%, leaving them higher than prior<lb/> to EU exit. No other barriers on services are modelled. This is very likely to lead to an underestimation of the<lb/> ultimate slowdown in services trade. FTAs between the UK and other countries are not treated as finalised<lb/> as priority is given to an FTA with the EU.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Real exports would initially drop by 8% if the UK were to lose its preferential access to the EU market and<lb/> its FTA&apos;s with third countries (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). The EU-UK MFN would decrease all trade between EU and UK, but MFN<lb/> restrictions vis-à-vis other countries then change the effect. This is because restrictions imposed by other countries are<lb/> partly larger than those imposed by the EU. If subsequently a new FTA between the UK and the EU27 were negotiated<lb/> that would re-install previous free market access, and some of that loss would be recuperated, but UK exports would<lb/> still see an overall decline of some 6.5% relative to the current situation.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Trade would be lower for all main categories of goods, hampering the functioning of value chains.</figure>

			<p>The<lb/> trade reduction in intermediate inputs has a particularly negative effect, as semi-finished products and components<lb/> typically cross borders to be further processed and combined with domestic produce before being exported for the next<lb/> stage and eventually reaching the final consumer. Not only would UK producers supply less intermediates to the EU,<lb/> the reverse is also true: imports of intermediates from the EU into value chains in the UK would fall by more than 9% in<lb/> the UK MFN scenario, and this would only partially be offset in the event of a new FTA between the UK and the EU 27.<lb/> EU-UK value chains would thus become less tightly knit and production costs would increase. The result of less than<lb/> full recuperation of EU markets is partly due to the assumption of slightly diverging regulatory regimes. Hence, new<lb/> trade costs related to non-tariff measures and rules of origin would have to be incurred by UK exporters.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Table 3. Decomposition of the near-term trade shock<lb/> Source: OECD calculations.<lb/> Even when an FTA with the EU is in place, trade would be significantly lower in several sectors. Detailed<lb/> sector-level analysis reveals that food and agriculture (-7%), chemicals (-9%), metals (-11%) and transport equipment<lb/> (-12%</figure>

			<p>) would see the largest negative impacts on production. Services, which together account for more than 80% of<lb/> employment in the UK, would witness a contraction of between -2% (business services) and -6% (financial services).<lb/> Part of that drop is due to a complementarity between services and manufacturing: services are necessary to enable<lb/> manufacturing and trade in goods, and when production shrinks, so does services activity. The scenarios are likely to<lb/> underestimate the importance of potential new barriers to services trade, as only barriers to financial services are<lb/> incorporated in the analysis.<lb/></p>

Calibration of the near-term effects of Brexit<lb/> Financial market shocks are assumed to be of a magnitude similar to those observed during the acute<lb/> phase of the euro area crisis in 2011-12, but much smaller than during the financial crisis in 2008-09. An<lb/> equation linking corporate bond spreads, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUI) and stock market volatility is<lb/> estimated for the UK since 2010. From April 2016, the bond spread is generated by adding a two standard deviation<lb/> shock to the EPUI and a two standard deviation shock to stock market volatility, relative to a baseline where stock<lb/> market volatility and policy uncertainty are set to their average values in 2014-15. As a result, the corporate bond<lb/> spread is 100 basis points above the baseline in the latter half of 2016 and 150 basis points above the baseline in<lb/> 2017. Broadly reflecting the calibrated shock above, the investment and equity risk premia are raised by 50 basis<lb/> points in the first half of 2016, 150 basis points over 2016H2-2017 and 100 basis points in 2018. Also, the wedge<lb/> between bank borrowing and lending rates for the household and corporate sectors is raised by 100 basis points over<lb/> 2016H2-2017. Finally, the term premium on government long-term bonds is raised, initially by 20 basis points in the<lb/> first half of 2016 and then by 50 basis points over in the rest of the simulation period. After 2018, these financial shocks<lb/> are allowed to fade gradually, although not completely, since formal exit from the EU would itself be an additional<lb/> source of uncertainty and additional risk. UK investment and equity risk premia are assumed to still be 70 basis points<lb/> higher than otherwise by 2023, although the shock to credit conditions is allowed to fade earlier by 2021.<lb/> MFN</figure>

			<figure>The exit vote can also be expected to hit confidence, leading UK households to undertake additional<lb/> precautionary saving. Higher saving would add to the negative impact on consumption from the decline in activity<lb/> and lower asset prices. To take this effect into account, a shock is applied raising the ex-ante saving rate by a little<lb/> over 1 percentage point in the latter half of 2016.<lb/> The aftermath of a vote to leave would also be likely to raise sterling risk premia, leading to an additional<lb/> sharp exchange rate depreciation. The impact of this depreciation is likely to be more limited than</figure>

			<p>in the past, but at<lb/> the margin it would be likely to reduce the overall impact of the other forces acting on the UK economy, whilst adding<lb/> to challenges in other economies, especially in Europe. A 10% depreciation of sterling against the US dollar was<lb/> assumed to occur in mid-2016, with all other bilateral exchange rates held unchanged. The depreciation was assumed<lb/> to be persistent, but to gradually fade over the simulation period. On average, the sterling effective exchange rate is<lb/> around 6% below baseline in 2017 and 4% below baseline from 2018 onwards, implying an appreciation of euro<lb/> relative to sterling and a permanent decline in the nominal effective sterling exchange rate.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The UK decision to exit could add to centrifugal forces in other parts of Europe and reinforce uncertainty<lb/> about the future of the Union and the Single Market. The resulting uncertainty could lead to more difficult financial<lb/> conditions in other European countries. To illustrate the possible magnitude of such factors, investment and equity risk<lb/> premia and the spread between household borrowing and deposit rates were widened in all European Economic Area<lb/> (EEA) countries. The shocks applied were between one-quarter and one-third of those in the UK, with risk premia<lb/> rising by 50 basis points at their peak and the interest rate spread by 25 basis points. No shocks were applied directly<lb/> to either term premia or to the household saving rate. The risk premia shock was held at 25 basis points over 2019-23.<lb/> For trade, a two-stage approach was adopted. The trade effects of the UK leaving the EU were obtained by<lb/> the OECD&apos;s METRO model (Box 2) and were fed into the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) macro<lb/> model for the world economy.<lb/> The reduction in UK trade openness would also start to have costs for the overall economic dynamism of<lb/> the UK economy, reducing competition and the inflow of new ideas and products. OECD estimates by Egert and<lb/> Gal (2016) imply that a four percentage points decline in trade openness reduces total factor productivity by 0.8% after<lb/> five years (and by 1.2% after 10 years). In the NiGEM near-term scenario the impact on productivity of the sharp fall in<lb/> trade (Box 2) was modelled as a decline in labour-augmenting technical progress building up to 1.6% by 2023.<lb/> Withdrawal from the EU could also provide scope for the imposition of tighter controls on inward<lb/> migration. This would reinforce the endogenous effects on economic migration coming from a weaker UK economy<lb/> and labour market. Net inward migration is assumed to decline by 84 000 per year over 2019-2023, with around 75%<lb/> of this reflected in the labour force.<lb/> All other model assumptions were the same as without a Brexit. The NiGEM model was run in backward-<lb/></figure>

			<p>looking mode, reflecting a judgment that in a period characterised by considerable uncertainty, businesses and<lb/> households would be unlikely to behave as if the future was known with certainty. All shocks were assumed to persist<lb/> at their 2023 levels thereafter for the purposes of model solution, but this assumption has no effect on the initial impact<lb/> of the shocks up to 2023. Monetary policy was left exogenous (although the depreciation of sterling changes monetary<lb/> conditions), and the budget targeting rule was left unchanged, implying that the UK government reacts to the various<lb/> shocks by attempting to maintain its announced budget path. The consequences of relaxing these assumptions are<lb/> discussed in the main text.<lb/> Source: Egert, B. and P. <ref type="biblio">Gal (2016)</ref>, &quot; The quantification of structural reforms: A new Framework &quot; , OECD Economics Department<lb/> Working Papers, forthcoming.<lb/></p>

			<head>Brexit</head>

			<figure>would generate a large negative shock to the UK economy, which would spillover to<lb/> other European countries. Assuming fixed interest rates at the zero lower bound, UK GDP growth would<lb/> be reduced by 0.5 percentage point in both 2017 and 2018. The onset of the trade shock in 2019 adds to<lb/> these costs considerably, with GDP growth reduced by 1.5 percentage points that year. These shocks<lb/> would be larger still without the depreciation of sterling included in the scenario, although the impact of<lb/> such a change may be weaker now than in the past. By 2020, real GDP would be more than 3% below the<lb/> level it would otherwise have been in the absence of Brexit (Figure 11), equivalent to a cost of GBP 2200<lb/> per household. By 2023, even as the risk premia shocks fade, and the economy begins to adjust to the<lb/> large trade shock, helped by a long-lasting depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, real GDP<lb/> would still remain around 2.5% lower than otherwise.<lb/> OECD ECONOMIC POLICY PAPERS, NO. 16 © OECD 2016<lb/> Figure 11. Near-term effects of Brexit on real GDP in the United Kingdom and the European Union<lb/> Difference from baseline, per cent<lb/> 12http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933351079<lb/> Source: OECD calculations.<lb/> The real exchange rate decline reflects the adjustment required to help restore external<lb/> balance in a situation in which exports are reduced. However, the UK terms of trade deteriorate<lb/> sharply, with export prices declining, as exporters try to improve global market share, and import prices<lb/> pushed up sharply by the depreciation of sterling. Lower exports and investment and the real exchange<lb/> rate decline hit import volumes substantially, with a decline of over 9% by 2020. At its peak in 2020, the UK<lb/> unemployment rate would be around 1.5 percentage point above baseline. Business investment would be<lb/> especially hard hit, declining by over 10% by 2020. Equity prices would also be strongly affected, initially<lb/> declining by around 15%.<lb/> The negative shocks would raise the UK budget deficit substantially. The deficit would increase<lb/> by around 0.9 percentage point of GDP on average per annum over 2019-21 (</figure>

			<p>in the absence of a fixed<lb/> budget target), more than offsetting the possible net fiscal savings from the ending of EU membership in<lb/> these years. This decline reflects the impact of lower activity on tax revenues and the costs of higher<lb/> unemployment. The UK could temporarily receive some additional revenue from tariffs on exit, by imposing<lb/> multilateral MFN rates on all trading partners, but these are likely to be limited, at around 0.3% of GDP,<lb/> and decline considerably once the UK concludes a new FTA with the EU by 2023. Thus there appears little<lb/> scope to use the EU budget savings to relax fiscal policy substantially for an extended period, unless there<lb/> is a decision to adjust other taxes and spending, or to raise the size of the overall budget deficit.<lb/></p>

			<figure>With shocks of between one-quarter and one-third of those in the UK, the GDP of the reduced<lb/> EU would be little affected in 2016, but would fall by close to 1% by 2020 (Figure 11, Panel B). Even<lb/> as the impact of higher risk premia in these economies starts to fade, the sharp decline in UK import<lb/> demand remains a sizeable drag for some economies. A larger sterling depreciation against domestic<lb/> currencies would magnify the negative impact on other European economies, as would any deeper<lb/> confidence shocks in those economies. On the other hand, a euro depreciation could help to offset some<lb/> of the negative impact, but at the expense of magnifying the negative effects on output in the UK.<lb/> Centrifugal forces within countries and within the reduced EU are not quantified fully, but<lb/> would be a major downside risk. Following the UK decision to exit, there could be doubts about the<lb/> future of the Single Market, and more broadly, of the EU. The UK itself would also face the possibility of a<lb/> break up, with political leaders in Scotland having indicated that they would seek a new referendum on<lb/> Scottish independence. Such developments would tighten financial conditions further. An actual break up,<lb/> either of the EU or the UK, would lead to considerably greater financial turbulence and a much larger<lb/> decline in investment and output.<lb/> -3.5<lb/> -3.0<lb/> -2.5<lb/> -2.0<lb/> -1.5<lb/> -1.0<lb/> -0.5<lb/> 0.0<lb/> -3.5<lb/> -3.0<lb/> -2.5<lb/> -2.0<lb/> -1.5<lb/> -1.0<lb/> -0.5<lb/> 0.0<lb/> 2018<lb/> 2020<lb/> 2023<lb/> United Kingdom<lb/> European Union excluding the UK<lb/> The large current account deficit, which exposes the UK to a sudden stop, and debt<lb/> refinancing issues are additional risks in the event of Brexit. The current account deficit was around<lb/> 5.5% of GDP in the second half of 2015 (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, Panel A), and reached an unprecedented level of 7%<lb/> of GDP in last quarter. It was financed significantly less by direct investment in the second half of the year<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, Panel B), creating important risks if there were to be sudden and large capital outflows.<lb/> Moreover, refinancing of government debt could also come under greater stress than assumed in the near<lb/> term scenario. Public debt is close to 90% of GDP (Maastricht definition), about a quarter of it is held by<lb/> foreigners, and the average maturity of public debt is long (slightly above 15 years). In January 2016, the<lb/> auction of five-year UK government debt nearly failed, and there is a risk that foreign investors could shun<lb/> UK government debt following a referendum outcome in favour of Brexit. The banking system could also<lb/> be subject to capital flight, and although it is has stronger capital and liquidity buffers than before the crisis,<lb/> the Bank of England has announced that it will offer additional liquidity support for banks just before and<lb/> after the referendum. If these risks were to materialise, they would aggravate the loss in GDP.<lb/></p>

Concerns stem from poor wage growth, which is a reflection largely of weak productivity<lb/> developments (<ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>, Panel B). Immigration is also increasing housing demand, creating upward<lb/> pressure on house prices, which reduces affordability for first-time buyers. However, the UK faces a long-<lb/>standing problem of weak housing supply, which would require bolder domestic policies to relax land<lb/> planning regulations. The UK Prime Minister has set the target of reducing net migration to below 100 000<lb/> per year assuming that the UK remains in the EU. Although not directly linked to negotiations with the EU<lb/> following Brexit, tighter controls in the UK could lead to a reduction of net migration from EU and non-EU<lb/> countries to below this level. This factor would be reinforced by the impact of a weaker economy and a loss<lb/> of inward investment. Labour market conditions and income levels in the UK relative to those in other<lb/> European countries would be hit by exit, reducing the incentives for economic migration to the UK. A<lb/> decline in inward investment would also lower new inflows of foreign managers and other skilled<lb/> professionals.<lb/></p>

			<head>A loss of skills would reduce technical progress<lb/></head>

			<p>Lower immigration and weaker FDI could reduce the pool of skills. Measures to control<lb/> immigration, based on the introduction of points systems as in Australia and Canada, help to increase skill<lb/> levels of new immigrants. However, should immigration controls be high, the effect of higher quality would<lb/> likely be offset by the effect of lower quantities, resulting in an overall reduction of the pool of skills which<lb/> could efficiently be combined in the production process. In turn, this could increase skill mismatches. Also,<lb/> another channel through which skills would be negatively affected is poorer FDI, resulting in weaker<lb/> transfer of best-practice knowledge from abroad, including managerial expertise, weakening overall<lb/> managerial quality over time. OECD research suggests (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>) that this would have a negative impact<lb/> on productivity, albeit modest.<lb/></p>

			<head>Further deregulation could have some positive effects<lb/></head>

			<figure>Deregulation could benefit businesses, but the scope seems limited. For example, the UK has<lb/> the second-lowest value of the OECD Product Market Regulation indicator and holds the 6<lb/> th position in the<lb/> World Bank&apos;s Doing Business ranking. Regulation of network industries has been the least restrictive<lb/> among OECD countries</figure>

			<p>, although the pace of regulatory reform has slowed down in recent years, possibly<lb/> reflecting the increasing difficulty of enacting further reforms when they are already at low levels (<ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 19</ref>, Panel A). However, in some sectors, notably post and road, the gap with the best performers remains<lb/> sizeable (<ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>, Panel B). Overall, EU membership has not been an obstacle for implementing liberal<lb/> market policies, since regulations are low relative to those in other EU member states, and, given that the<lb/> best performers in some areas are other EU countries, the UK is not even using all the available regulatory<lb/> space. Reducing regulation in these areas thus requires overcoming strong domestic barriers, which would<lb/> be challenging. Despite labour market regulation being among the least restrictive in the OECD, many UK<lb/> firms find EU labour market regulation too tight, in particular the Temporary Agency Workers Directive and<lb/> the Working Time Directive. However, there is no guarantee that the political constellation after Brexit<lb/> would ensure more business friendly legislation in substitution of abolished EU laws.<lb/></p>

Calibration of the longer-term effects of Brexit<lb/> In the longer term, a central scenario is considered as well as an optimistic and pessimistic scenario.<lb/></figure>

			<p>These draw on OECD research to quantify the impact of non-EU membership on trade openness and the inward FDI<lb/> stock, different assumptions about the degree to which the UK reduces anti-competitive product market regulations in<lb/> network industries, and the impact of changes in managerial quality. Different assumptions about the possible impact<lb/> exit might have on net migration into the UK are also considered. As the results depend on how these different factors<lb/> interact and their overall size, a range of outcomes from different specifications is used in the scenarios below.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<p>In the longer term, trade openness is estimated to decline by between 10 to 20%, based on the range of<lb/> empirical estimates presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>			<figure>in Fournier et al. (2015).<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The longer term inward FDI stock is estimated to decline by between 10 to 45%, based the range of<lb/> empirical estimates presented in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> in <ref type="biblio">Fournier (2015)</ref>. This decline in FDI would also contribute<lb/> indirectly to weaker trade performance.<lb/> • Given the important role that high-productivity foreign-owned firms have in the UK business sector, the<lb/> declines in inward FDI were assumed to transfer directly to the amount of R&amp;D undertaken in the UK by<lb/> foreign multinationals. To the extent that agglomeration economies from the UK research base matter, it is<lb/> possible that this could overstate the likely longer term effect from EU exit, even if export-oriented foreign-<lb/>owned firms (including those in financial services) gradually withdrew from the UK.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>The decline in inward investment was also judged to be likely to result in an overall reduction in<lb/> management quality in the United Kingdom, based on Bloom et al. (2014). The impact of particular changes<lb/> in managerial quality on skill mismatches, and hence productivity, was based on McGowan and Andrews<lb/> (2015).<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Annual net migration into the UK is assumed to decline by between 56 000 per annum to 116 000 per<lb/> annum, depending on the stringency of future controls and the extent to which the weaker economy deters<lb/> economic migration to the UK. In the central scenario, net migration into the UK is assumed to be 84 000<lb/> lower per year. Implicitly, it is assumed that net migration from non-EU countries would fall compared to<lb/> 2015 levels, so that employers do not respond to tighter controls on EU migration by seeking to attract more<lb/> people from outside the EU.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>The decline in immigration also reduces labour force growth. It is assumed that 75% of the foregone<lb/> migrants would have been in the labour force, consistent with evidence of the participation of recent EU<lb/> immigration inflows.<lb/> • Outside the EU, the UK might seek to improve the business climate by undertaking additional regulatory<lb/> reforms to stimulate additional competition in network industries. The best possibility considered is that the<lb/> UK continues to undertake reforms over the next 10 years at the same pace as during 2009-13, i.e. 0.2<lb/> points per five-year period. In the pessimistic scenario, it is assumed that no further reforms in network<lb/> industries are undertaken.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The impact of forces acting in the different longer term scenarios is set out in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. For simulation purposes, it<lb/> was assumed that the full longer term effects on productivity of these changes emerge by 2026, a decade after the<lb/> vote to exit. The annual decline in net immigration was assumed to persist from 2019 onwards, giving a total<lb/> population decline of 1.3 million by 2030 in the &quot; pessimistic &quot; scenario.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In the central scenario, UK GDP is more than 5% below the baseline by 2030 (Figure 20, Panel<lb/> A). This is equivalent to an annual reduction in UK GDP growth of 0.3 percentage points per annum over<lb/> 2016 to 2030. Around three-fifths</figure>

			<p>of this shock is accounted for by the lower level of productivity (including<lb/> its indirect effect via a lower capital stock). In turn, most of this stems from the decline in trade openness.<lb/> Stronger regulatory reforms and a smaller decline in trade and inward FDI weaken the longer term output<lb/> effect in the optimistic scenario, but GDP is still below baseline, by around 2.7% as of 2030. A failure to<lb/> undertake regulatory reforms, together with strong declines in inward migration, trade openness and<lb/> innovation would result in much more negative outcomes, with GDP over 7.5% below baseline by 2030.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 20.

Nonetheless, in the central scenario, the GDP decline is<lb/> equivalent to a cost per household of GBP 3200 by 2030 relative to the baseline (Figure 20, Panel B). In<lb/> the pessimistic scenario, the equivalent cost per household is nearly GBP 5000 in 2030 relative to the<lb/> baseline.<lb/> In addition to the decline in output (relative to baseline), the cumulative effects of the different<lb/> shocks from Brexit also reduce the real stock of net assets the UK has available to provide future<lb/> returns and meet future commitments. UK real net worth, given by the deflated sum of domestic<lb/> tangible assets and the sterling value of net financial assets held by UK residents outside the UK, is over<lb/> 4% below baseline by 2030 in the central scenario (<ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>). In per capita terms, this is equivalent to a<lb/> decline of over GBP 4300 per person. Almost all of this stems from the longer-term decline in the business<lb/> sector capital stock as a result of the negative shocks from Brexit, with only a small offset provided by an<lb/> improved external position. In the pessimistic scenario, UK net worth (in 2015 prices) is just under 5.5%<lb/> below baseline.<lb/></p>

			<p>Reforms that reduce barriers to competition would enhance trade and FDI for all EU members, including the UK.<lb/> A lower bound of the possible gains can be obtained by looking only at reforms recommended by the OECD for the EU<lb/> and embedded in the PMR indicator (OECD, 2016), and assuming that their implementation would be accompanied by<lb/> a reduction of PMR heterogeneity. According to <ref type="biblio">Fournier et al. (2015) and Fournier (2015)</ref>, a scenario of a reformed<lb/> EU could boost UK trade by 3% and the UK inward FDI stock by 2%. In particular, trade between the EU and the UK<lb/> would increase by 4.5% and FDI between the UK and the EU by 3%. The benefits for trade and FDI in the whole EU<lb/> would be roughly similar. The higher trade and FDI would raise GDP in both the UK and the EU (OECD, 2016). These<lb/> effects could be larger if the EU also reaches new free trade and investment agreements with the rest of the world (e.g.<lb/> the on-going EU-US negotiation on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership).<lb/></p>
