            <figDesc>B). Low relative returns to labour limit the inclusiveness of labour<lb/> markets by discouraging participation and delivering excessive benefits to capital holders.<lb/> A minimum wage was introduced in 2013, applying to both Malaysian national and migrant<lb/> workers. In 2009, around 34% of private sector workers earned less than MYR 700 (USD 175) per month,<lb/> below the MYR 800 (USD 200) national poverty line income. The introduction of the minimum wage<lb/> was estimated to have increased the wages of roughly 3.2 million private sector workers, or approximately<lb/> 30% of the total workforce, though a systematic assessment of beneficiaries has not been carried out<lb/> post implementation (UNDP, 2013; BNM 2013). The decline in relative poverty between 2012 and 2014<lb/> may reflect a positive impact of the minimum wage (Figure 2.B). Rates are determined every two-<lb/>three years by a consultative council comprising government, employer association and union<lb/> representatives. As of 1 July 2016, the monthly rate was raised to MYR 1 000 (USD 250) for Peninsular<lb/> Malaysia and MYR 920 (USD 240) for the states of Sabah and Sarawak. The minimum for Peninsular<lb/> Malaysia stood at 57% of the median wage in 2014.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> </figDesc>

Nonetheless, some difficult tax reforms have been implemented to reduce the rate of<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 22<lb/> revenue decline, including the introduction of the GST in April 2015 as well as an increase in the top<lb/> marginal income tax rate from 25% to 28%. Intensifying popular concerns with rising cost-of-living<lb/> pressures have more recently reversed the momentum for tax reform, prompting an expansion of the number<lb/> of exempt or zero-rated GST items and a series of new income and corporate tax deductions.</figDesc>

The high proportion of home ownership, while in some ways supportive of<lb/> inclusive growth, suggests incentives to invest (including low tax rates) are skewing household investment<lb/> towards property. Even minor increases in taxes on capital income and gains from property could raise<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 24<lb/> significant revenue given the size of the potential base, while at the same time improving the progressivity<lb/> of the tax system. Property taxes are also underutilised, with ongoing taxes based on the value of the<lb/> property another possible means to achieve similar objectives. Additionally, with constitutional<lb/> responsibility for property taxes with state governments, reform in this area could support fiscal<lb/> decentralisation.</figDesc>
