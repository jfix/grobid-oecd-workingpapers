			<head>............................................... 60<lb/> Executive Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>There is still uncertainty surrounding the use of tradable greenhouse gas (GHG) units in a post-2012<lb/> international climate change policy framework, despite progress made at the 16 th Conference of the Parties<lb/> (COP 16) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Cancún. In particular, it is<lb/> not clear whether the current approach under the Kyoto Protocol of allocating centrally-administered<lb/> emissions allowances for Annex I countries will continue and be built upon, or whether a future system<lb/> will be based on emission reduction pledges by countries and therefore less centralised. This paper<lb/> examines environmental and institutional implications of the use of tradable GHG units under different<lb/> international accounting scenarios, and explores elements of common ground between scenarios.<lb/></p>

			<p>While a mix of policy instruments is normally needed to address GHG emissions across an economy,<lb/> market-based mechanisms offer some advantages over more traditional regulatory approaches in obtaining<lb/> environmental objectives. These include their ability to attain a mitigation goal at a lower total cost and to<lb/> create on-going incentives for innovation. Market-based instruments usually rely on recognised tradable<lb/> units that can command value in a marketplace. To ensure the environmental and financial integrity of<lb/> such instruments, units must be defined through robust and transparent GHG accounting frameworks.<lb/> Without this, the environmental and economic benefits of using international market mechanisms to<lb/> enhance climate change mitigation could be diminished.<lb/> International accounting for emissions and traded units under the Kyoto Protocol currently relies upon a<lb/> number of harmonised technical tools operating at national and international levels. Accounting is based on<lb/> quantified emissions allowance units (Assigned Amount Units, AAUs) for Annex I Parties with Kyoto<lb/> Protocol emissions commitments. These units are held in national Kyoto registries hosted by each Party.<lb/> Registries are linked to one another via the International Transaction Log (ITL), a database that verifies the<lb/> validity of each transaction as well as recording the movements of all GHG units. The Kyoto Protocol<lb/> accounting system is also designed to link with national unit registry systems for domestic emissions<lb/> trading schemes such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Although a number of<lb/> GHG unit types already exist – including allowances from regional trading schemes and voluntary offset<lb/> units – international GHG accounting remains tightly woven around the Kyoto framework.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two main factors are likely to render the post-2012 framework more complex than the existing accounting<lb/> system. Firstly, until 2012 Annex I Parties with Kyoto Protocol commitments are the only countries to be<lb/> held accountable to their emissions inventories and use of GHG units. The introduction of national<lb/> mitigation pledges by some non-Annex I countries, even though voluntary in nature, may complicate how<lb/> tradable units are accounted for; for example, emissions reductions could be &apos;double counted&apos; as part of<lb/> two countries&apos; pledges. Secondly, the creation of new unit types in parallel with units from the existing<lb/> Kyoto Protocol mechanisms may require different tracking and accounting processes to be implemented.<lb/> New units could be based on common guiding principles and minimum requirements.<lb/></p>

			<p>The introduction of non-Annex I mitigation pledges creates three broad groups of countries based on their<lb/> targets or pledges:<lb/>  Annex I countries with economy-wide targets: absolute economy-wide reduction or limitation<lb/> targets, which may or may not be translated into quantified amounts for allocation of<lb/> international allowance units;<lb/>  Non-Annex I countries with quantified mitigation goals: usually calculated as a national or<lb/> sectoral goal for reduction in intensity relative to a base-year, or as a deviation from a pre-<lb/>established business-as-usual emissions trajectory;<lb/>  Non-Annex I countries with pledged actions: could involve actions with direct measurable GHG<lb/> impacts or more general policy changes with environmental benefits, without any overarching<lb/> quantified mitigation goal.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mitigation goals put forward by non-Annex I countries could result in double counting of emissions<lb/> reductions achieved through offset mechanisms hosted in those countries after 2012. Depending on the<lb/> particular conditions applied to non-Annex I mitigation goals, host countries may count reductions from<lb/> CDM or other offset projects as support for the achievement of their domestic mitigation goal, even if<lb/> these offsets are subsequently used by Annex I countries in meeting their own reduction targets. This can<lb/> be interpreted as double counting of the emissions reduction.<lb/></p>

			<p>The nature of emissions-intensity pledges made by developing countries means that the final<lb/> environmental result is often dependent on economic performance and so is uncertain; the double counting<lb/> or not of project-based emissions credits in developing countries would be another element of uncertainty<lb/> in an already uncertain calculation. How this issue is resolved and how the overall level of global<lb/> mitigation is determined is a matter of political negotiation and is not the focus of this paper. If the<lb/> international GHG accounting framework can be designed to allow for accurate tracking of multiple GHG<lb/> unit types and participation from a wide range of countries, then it could form the basis for a robust system<lb/> allowing international co-operation and cost-effective reduction of global emissions, within which national<lb/> pledges can be implemented.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another type of double counting could also occur, whereby a single emissions reduction is credited by two<lb/> different offset mechanisms. This could be avoided through ensuring rigorous standards for all<lb/> mechanisms that become eligible for helping to meet national mitigation commitments, and by employing<lb/> an international tracking system for unit transactions.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a range of options for international GHG accounting, from a top-down, centralised model<lb/> based on the Kyoto Protocol to a fragmented, bottom-up approach with minimal international co-<lb/>ordination. It also shows a series of building blocks for the accounting system, such as accounting rules,<lb/> the role of the UNFCCC and offset governance. The extremes of this range are unlikely to be feasible<lb/> outcomes of international negotiations. Two more central scenarios are therefore considered in detail – one<lb/> based on a second commitment period (CP) of the Kyoto Protocol without participation of all Annex I<lb/> countries and one based on country-led objectives (&apos;Pledge and review&apos; in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Elements from each<lb/> of these approaches could also be combined in a &apos;middle ground&apos; scenario.<lb/></p>

			<head>Scenario: Kyoto Protocol for some Annex I countries<lb/></head>

			<p>This scenario, with some Annex I Parties continuing to participate in a second commitment period of the<lb/> Kyoto Protocol, could involve the following characteristics:<lb/>  The ITL would remain under control of the UNFCCC. Participating Annex I countries would<lb/> maintain registries to UN specifications which are connected to the ITL. Non-participating<lb/> Annex I countries, as well as some non-Annex I countries, may choose to establish domestic<lb/> registries to handle domestic or bilateral units, and these registries may be connected to the ITL.<lb/>  International allowance units would be allocated to participating Annex I countries according to<lb/> an assigned amount calculated from a reduction relative to a base year. These could be traded<lb/> between registries (via the ITL) and national mechanisms could be introduced and backed-up by<lb/> international allowances, as with the existing EU ETS 1 . Establishing a link with any domestic<lb/> trading systems and offset mechanisms in non-participating Annex I countries could be<lb/> challenging under this model, as the ITL is currently designed to handle only Kyoto-linked units<lb/> passing between registries in Kyoto Annex B countries. To change this would require a provision<lb/> to recognise non-Kyoto units based on common agreed criteria.<lb/>  All Parties would continue to report information under the UNFCCC as laid out in the Cancún<lb/> Agreements. Non-Annex I countries with national or sectoral mitigation goals would submit any<lb/> 9<lb/> such goal according to their preferred calculation method, and report inventory and offset<lb/> information to the UNFCCC at an appropriate level of detail. This information would form the<lb/> basis for demonstrating progress towards implementing their goal.<lb/>  The UNFCCC would continue to act as the main regulator and issuer of the Clean Development<lb/> Mechanism (CDM), with the UNFCCC Secretariat continuing to host the CDM Registry into<lb/> which Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from CDM projects are issued.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under this scenario, new market mechanisms could be developed under the auspices of the UN, with<lb/> issuance of credits for actions that exceed agreed baselines in participating programmes, sectors, etc. in<lb/> developing countries. Baselines could incorporate different levels of ambition relative to business as usual.<lb/></p>

			<p>Credits could be issued into a central unit registry, with transactions still tracked by the ITL 2 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Annex I countries not participating in the Kyoto Protocol system would demonstrate progress towards<lb/> mitigation objectives through their inventory reporting, in addition to information on use of units from UN-<lb/>10<lb/> based mechanisms and other types of mechanisms. Should these countries choose to develop new unit<lb/> types, for example bilateral offset schemes based on common guiding principles and minimum standards,<lb/> these would need to be tracked to ensure international visibility. As the ITL currently only handles Kyoto<lb/> Protocol units, a substantial redesign of the ITL may be required to ensure accurate accounting under this<lb/> scenario.<lb/></p>

			<head>Scenario: &apos;Pledge-and-review&apos;<lb/></head>

			<p>At the other end of the range of potentially feasible options for GHG accounting, a country-led system<lb/> without any Kyoto-style allowance units would be based on country pledges defined with a level of<lb/> international co-ordination. National mitigation objectives could still be met through market mechanisms<lb/> in parallel with UN-based mechanisms. This model could be characterised by the following features:<lb/>  In the absence of Kyoto allowance units, reporting requirements would remain for Annex I and<lb/> non-Annex I national communications, national inventory reports and biennial reports, according<lb/> to the framework described in the COP 16 decisions. Countries would still be requested to submit<lb/> reports to the UNFCCC with varying levels of detail depending on national capabilities. Annex I<lb/> countries would be required to demonstrate which reduction units have been used to meet the<lb/> national emissions commitment.<lb/>  Under this model, the ITL would cease to operate and the UNFCCC would no longer be<lb/> responsible for the issuance and tracking of GHG units used by countries to meet mitigation<lb/> targets or goals. With the exception of CERs issued through a continuation of the CDM process,<lb/> all tradable units would be issued under agreements between selling and buying governments. A<lb/> registry or tracking system would be needed to disclose unit transactions, in order to secure<lb/> international transparency of the implementation of national mitigation pledges using multiple<lb/> unit types. Therefore an independent transaction tracking system might be necessary.<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparing scenarios<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares pros and cons of an accounting system with or without universal common allowance<lb/> units; a more comprehensive assessment is given in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> in section 5.3. To ensure environmental<lb/> integrity without a common allowance unit, some international co-ordination and transparency of<lb/> accounting would be required. Without this co-ordination the benefits of using international tradable<lb/> emissions units – both allowance units from national/sub-national trading schemes and offset credits – may<lb/> be lost because of the need to ensure a level of equivalence and shared understanding of what those units<lb/> represent. However, a more devolved system provides increased flexibility for countries to develop<lb/> baselines and objectives that fit with their national circumstances, potentially making it easier for countries<lb/> to increase participation and mitigation ambition over time.<lb/></p>

			<p>An increase of GHG unit types after 2012 is likely under any scenario and evidence for this already exists.<lb/> For example, some Annex I countries have started exploring offset schemes based on bilateral agreements<lb/> which may qualify for use in sub-national cap-and-trade schemes in the US and Canada or to help with<lb/> meeting national objectives. Legislation describing the EU ETS after 2012 allows for the potential use of<lb/> credits generated from projects or other emission reducing activities implemented through direct<lb/> agreements concluded with non-EU countries. The EU post-2012 legislation also provides an option to<lb/> develop offsets within the EU but from sectors outside the EU ETS. In other countries, domestic policy<lb/> mechanisms may generate unit types that contribute to GHG mitigation, but which are not measured in<lb/> terms of GHG reduction; these may be linked to carbon markets in the future.<lb/></p>

			<head>The &apos;middle ground&apos; option<lb/></head>

			<p>A &apos;middle ground&apos; option combining elements of both of the scenarios presented above is also possible.<lb/> Whilst this middle ground would not employ a single centrally-allocated international allowance unit,<lb/> some common accounting rules would be agreed to ensure shared understanding of the content and scope<lb/> of pledges in order to provide a stable platform for international use of offset units; experience from the<lb/> Kyoto Protocol could serve this purpose. For example, the Protocol already allows some flexibility for<lb/> activities that countries can choose to include in the baseline under specific conditions. The use of such<lb/> opt-in clauses could help to encourage increased participation of a wider group of countries under a middle<lb/> ground scenario, whilst maintaining a level of international co-ordination of accounting rules. The<lb/> UNFCCC would continue to play an important role in international GHG unit accounting, albeit markedly<lb/> different from its current role.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to continuing to issue CERs from CDM projects, the UNFCCC institutions could play a further<lb/> role in providing common guiding principles or minimum standards that Parties would adopt for country-<lb/>led offset mechanisms. In such a role, the UNFCCC would be acting as a standard-or guideline-setting<lb/> body rather than the sole authority on certification and approval. Under this scenario, important questions<lb/> to address would include what, if any, common guiding principles or minimum standards for defining<lb/> offsets are needed, how they can be agreed outside the framework of common allowance units and what<lb/> elements such common guiding principles or minimum standards should cover.<lb/></p>

			<p>A robust accounting system would need a reliable means to track the movement of GHG units between<lb/> national accounts. The ITL could be modified to continue to serve this purpose outside of a Kyoto Protocol<lb/> commitment period. In this case the ITL would continue to operate as a UN-managed log to track<lb/> transactions, without maintaining its current additional verification role whereby it refuses any transaction<lb/> that infringes Kyoto rules. The ITL would need to be adapted to handle an increased number of unit types<lb/> and connections to new unit registries in countries that do not currently host Kyoto unit registries (both<lb/> Annex I and non Annex I). Such new unit types could involve domestic units from sub-national schemes –<lb/> both allowances and offsets – that, although issued under the authority of a national government, could be<lb/> tracked by the ITL.<lb/></p>

			<head>Learning from other experience<lb/></head>

			<p>There is already experience with existing complex international accounting processes outside of the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol framework, including regulation of transactions in financial markets and the development of a<lb/> heterogeneous market for voluntary carbon offsets. Such accounting processes may provide constructive<lb/> lessons for the post-2012 accounting framework; some are explored in the paper. Financial markets have<lb/> developed systems for regulating transactions, including data standards for international communication of<lb/> transactions and requirements for international transparency on transaction details. The existing market in<lb/> voluntary emissions reduction credits (VERs) involves handling multiple unit types on a network of linked<lb/> registries and has undergone gradual rationalisation to make this accounting more efficient.<lb/> This paper puts forward elements of a framework for unit accounting in an international policy framework<lb/> that uses learning from past experience whilst embracing further use of market mechanisms over time.<lb/> Further research will continue to explore elements of a plausible international unit accounting system.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 1: Unit accounting issues in systems with or without common allowance<lb/> System based on common allowance unit System with no common allowance unit<lb/> Pros<lb/>  Clear definition of commitments, process for<lb/> demonstrating progress for participating Annex I<lb/> countries.<lb/>  Existing UN institutions and processes<lb/> would form a solid basis for development of<lb/> mechanisms, including tracking of units used by<lb/> countries to help them meet mitigation pledges.<lb/>  Enables comparisons between participating<lb/> countries, including offsets and allowance units<lb/> from domestic schemes, supporting the<lb/> environmental integrity of different units and the<lb/> whole system.<lb/>  Allowance units from domestic or regional<lb/> trading schemes could be backed up by<lb/> international allowance units, as the EU ETS has<lb/> been until 1 January 2012. This could simplify<lb/> integration of new unit types and links to<lb/> national policy mechanisms.<lb/>  Allowance system suited to a small number<lb/> of centrally-organised offset mechanisms, such<lb/> as used under the KP, providing good assurance<lb/> of environmental integrity.<lb/></table>

			<p><lb/> Allows countries increased flexibility to<lb/> develop baselines and objectives that fit with<lb/> national development goals both for Annex I and<lb/> non-Annex I countries, and the risk of banking<lb/> excess allowance units into a future period is<lb/> avoided in a system without allowance units.<lb/>  The flexibility of a pledge-based system<lb/> means that countries can develop policy tools<lb/> involving emissions units – such as domestic<lb/> trading schemes – to achieve pledges that suit<lb/> each country&apos;s situation. To benefit from<lb/> international trading of these units by linking<lb/> schemes, some level of international transparency<lb/> and comparison would be required.<lb/>  While the existence of various unit types and<lb/> offset mechanisms may put an additional burden<lb/> on investors and developers, it would generate<lb/> additional investment opportunities in areas which<lb/> the existing systems do not cover. The flexibility<lb/> to develop country-specific mechanisms could<lb/> increase innovation in mitigation projects and<lb/> learning between different systems, without<lb/> constraint of UN-regulated procedures.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cons<lb/></head>

			<p> Allowance-based system limits flexibility for<lb/> country-specific requirements and so some<lb/> countries may be disinclined to participate;<lb/> alternative procedures would still be needed to<lb/> account for commitments made by non-<lb/>participating countries.<lb/></p>

			<p> Joining an allowance system may prove to<lb/> be a barrier preventing developing countries<lb/> from taking increased mitigation responsibility.<lb/> Currently, the Kyoto Protocol does not account<lb/> for aggregated actions in developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<p> Countries not participating in the allowance<lb/> system may introduce new country-organised<lb/> bilateral mechanisms which could be difficult to<lb/> integrate without substantial redesign of tracking<lb/> system.<lb/>  Without some degree of harmonisation and a<lb/> transparent system for tracking units, international<lb/> comparison of commitments or demonstration of<lb/> progress could be difficult, including the 2013-15<lb/> review of action stipulated by the Cancún<lb/> Agreements. In the absence of a common<lb/> allowance unit, accounting rules for defining<lb/> pledges and demonstrating achievement towards<lb/> them may become increasingly important to avoid<lb/> a reduction in transparency and a risk of lowered<lb/> environmental integrity.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore systems for tracking emissions units in a post-2012<lb/> international climate change policy framework, focusing on technical issues and how political<lb/> decisions may have bearing upon them. The paper focuses on the quantification and accounting of<lb/> transferable or tradable GHG units, rather than the measurement and reporting of emissions<lb/> themselves. It presents scenarios to explore what systems might be put in place or modified for GHG<lb/> unit accounting under possible future international climate frameworks. It considers options for a<lb/> system similar to the Kyoto Protocol and for a more decentralised system, as well as elements that<lb/> combine both models. The analysis covers accounting of units outside the Kyoto framework and the<lb/> potential role of voluntary carbon market offsets, new market mechanisms, forestry and other<lb/> accounting rules. It also considers the implications of these scenarios for international emissions<lb/> trading.<lb/> Up until 2012, the international infrastructure for emissions accounting is relatively straightforward:<lb/> Annex I Parties with Kyoto Protocol commitments (Annex B countries) are required to translate<lb/> limitation or reduction commitments into an absolute quantity of allowed annual emissions, whereas<lb/> other Parties are not. After 2012, a wider range of countries have pledged national or sectoral<lb/> emissions goals under the Copenhagen Accord and the decisions adopted at COP 16 in Cancún.<lb/> Faced with uncertainty over the form of the future international framework, some countries are<lb/> already proposing new types of GHG unit to use as offset mechanisms. Others are proposing domestic<lb/> climate change policies such as cap-and-trade systems, which may also introduce new unit types. This<lb/> increase in types of tradable emissions units as domestic emissions trading and offsetting schemes are<lb/> established may complicate international GHG accounting, particularly if the accounting standards for<lb/> these units diverge from standardised UNFCCC approaches.<lb/> Greenhouse gas accounting is inherently complicated because of the need to monitor, report on and<lb/> even trade rights to an intangible invisible substance which in most cases has no intrinsic value other<lb/> than that imposed by policy choices. Transparency and accountability of GHG units is one aspect of<lb/> ensuring that global mitigation goals are quantified and achieved. Others include clarity on the<lb/> interpretation of national emissions abatement pledges, procedures for accounting rules for setting<lb/> baselines and goals, as well as economic projections for intensity metrics. These all add important<lb/> elements of uncertainty but are not the focus of this paper.<lb/> GHG unit accounting is nevertheless important to the UNFCCC negotiation process because accurate<lb/> accounting of unit flows is critical for tracking progress towards quantitative emissions pledges in a<lb/> transparent and commensurate manner. Other key issues include how projects originating in the<lb/> Kyoto flexible mechanisms are accounted for after 2012, and what role the UNFCCC may have in<lb/> developing rules for, or administering, the GHG unit accounting system.<lb/> Clarity in how these issues will be managed is important to ensure that any future agreement on<lb/> international mitigation has environmental credibility, and that the aggregate emissions pledges are<lb/> sufficient to also achieve the international goal of maintaining global temperature rise to within 2˚C. It<lb/> is also important for minimising the cost of emissions reductions, by choosing arrangements that<lb/> support international trading.<lb/> This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews current international emissions accounting rules<lb/> and describes existing GHG unit types. Section 3 outlines the range of possible scenarios for GHG<lb/> accounting post-2012, and looks at two particular scenarios in more detail. Section 4 then considers<lb/> how tradable offset units might develop and implications of this on the international GHG accounting<lb/> framework. Section 5 returns to the two post-2012 scenarios proposed to examine how GHG unit<lb/> transactions and flows might operate. Section 6 looks at how elements of these two scenarios might be<lb/> combined into a &apos;middle ground&apos; option, including aspects of international governance. Section 7<lb/> draws conclusions.<lb/> 14<lb/></p>

			<head>2. The existing international emissions accounting and units<lb/> framework<lb/> 2.1 Reporting on emissions and tradable units<lb/></head>

			<p>Up until 2012, there have been three main channels through which countries have reported to the<lb/> international community on the accounting of GHG emissions and the tradable units created to<lb/> account for emissions and reductions:<lb/>  National communications (NCs) under the UNFCCC: all countries have a responsibility to<lb/> prepare NCs, with more stringent requirements for developed countries included in Annex I<lb/> to the Convention;<lb/>  Annual GHG inventories and national inventory reports (NIRs) detailing GHG emissions<lb/> (for Annex I countries only);<lb/>  Kyoto Protocol (KP) annual reporting of supplementary information: countries included in<lb/> Annex B to the Protocol report annually on the use of units created by the Protocol and its<lb/> flexibility mechanisms, to demonstrate their progress towards compliance with emissions<lb/> limitation or reduction commitments adopted under the Protocol.<lb/> To date, NCs and NIRs focus on reporting emissions sources and do not include information on the<lb/> holding and transfer of tradable units. The decisions taken at COP 16 in Cancún request all Parties to<lb/> submit biennial updates of NCs. The form of these reports is not yet clear, though developed countries<lb/> are expected to include information on unit transfers, and possible formats have been proposed (<ref type="biblio">Ellis<lb/> et al, 2011</ref>). Up to 2012, the only international reporting of tradable GHG units is through Annex B<lb/> Parties reporting on progress towards their Kyoto Protocol commitments, as described in the annex to<lb/> this paper.<lb/> This section introduces the key GHG unit types already in existence and then focuses on the<lb/> international systems developed to account for and allow transfer of Kyoto Protocol GHG units.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Existing variety in GHG units pre-2012<lb/></head>

			<p>The international framework already comprises various types of GHG accounting units. These can be<lb/> divided into those that can be used for compliance purposes under the Kyoto Protocol, and those<lb/> outside of the Kyoto framework. Units can be further distinguished into allowances (permits) for cap-<lb/>and-trade schemes and offsets (credits). Finally, non-Kyoto units can be divided into units specific to<lb/> regional or national trading schemes, and those that operate internationally.<lb/></p>

This table is not<lb/> exhaustive.<lb/> Table 2: Examples of existing unit types pre-2012<lb/> Allowances<lb/> Credits<lb/> Kyoto<lb/> (International)<lb/> AAU,<lb/> Assigned<lb/> Amount Unit<lb/> International allowance<lb/> unit for Kyoto compliance<lb/> and international emissions<lb/> trading<lb/> CER,<lb/> Certified<lb/> Emissions<lb/> Reduction 3<lb/> Offset unit for Kyoto<lb/> compliance, generated<lb/> through Clean<lb/> Development Mechanism<lb/> projects in non-Annex I<lb/> countries<lb/> ERU,<lb/> Emissions<lb/> Reduction<lb/> Unit<lb/> Offset unit for Kyoto<lb/> compliance, generated<lb/> through Joint<lb/> Implementation projects<lb/> in Kyoto Annex B<lb/> countries<lb/> Non-Kyoto<lb/> Regional/<lb/> National<lb/> EUA,<lb/> European<lb/> Union<lb/> Allowance 4<lb/> Allowance unit for<lb/> European Emissions<lb/> Trading System<lb/> CRT,<lb/> Climate<lb/> Registry<lb/> Tonne<lb/> US offset unit developed<lb/> under Climate Action<lb/> Registry standards<lb/> NZU,<lb/> New Zealand<lb/> Unit 5<lb/> Allowance unit for New<lb/> Zealand Emissions Trading<lb/> System<lb/> CFI,<lb/> Carbon<lb/> Financial<lb/> Instrument<lb/> Offsets used specifically<lb/> for the Chicago Climate<lb/> Exchange voluntary cap-<lb/>and-trade scheme,<lb/> disbanded in 2010<lb/> RGGI<lb/> Allowances<lb/> Allowances for the<lb/> mandatory power sector<lb/> trading system in US north-<lb/>eastern states (Regional<lb/> Greenhouse Gas Initiative)<lb/> RGGI<lb/> Offsets<lb/> Offset for use in RGGI<lb/> scheme, usually<lb/> generated from projects<lb/> in RGGI states<lb/> (international offsets<lb/> permitted only if<lb/> allowance price passes<lb/> certain threshold)<lb/> Non-Kyoto<lb/> International<lb/> None<lb/> No fully international<lb/> allowance system exists<lb/> outside of the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol<lb/> VCU,<lb/> Voluntary<lb/> Carbon<lb/> Unit<lb/> Offset generated using<lb/> Voluntary Carbon<lb/> Standard methodologies<lb/> (from offset projects in<lb/> NAI countries) and<lb/> issued into private sector<lb/> registries<lb/> Gold<lb/> Standard<lb/> VER<lb/> Offset generated from<lb/> projects using Gold<lb/> Standard methodologies<lb/> and issued into Gold<lb/> Standard specific registry<lb/> &apos;Compliance&apos; versus &apos;voluntary&apos; units<lb/></table>

			<p>GHG units can also be categorised as either &apos;compliance&apos; or &apos;voluntary&apos; units, depending on whether<lb/> they can be used to meet a legally-binding obligation. Kyoto units are compliance units because they<lb/> can be used by countries to meet obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. Some allowance units from<lb/> regional trading systems are also compliance units, because they can be used to meet legal obligations<lb/> placed on capped entities by national or regional governments.<lb/></p>

			<head>3<lb/></head>

			<p>Variants of CERs known as long-term and temporary CERs (lCER and tCER) are issued for<lb/> afforestation/reforestation CDM projects (see annex for details)<lb/> 16<lb/></p>

			<p>In countries with Kyoto Protocol obligations, domestic or regional trading systems are usually used as<lb/> tools to meet national Kyoto commitments. Units traded within the domestic system do not affect the<lb/> country&apos;s national Kyoto compliance position because they are embedded into national Kyoto<lb/> Protocol GHG accounting. The EU ETS is an example of this; it also permits the use of Kyoto<lb/> Protocol offset units (CERs and ERUs) as compliance instruments within the scheme. CERs and<lb/> ERUs used in this way are in turn retired by national governments as part of the Kyoto compliance<lb/> procedure (see annex for details).<lb/> Some unit types are at present purely &apos;voluntary&apos; because they cannot currently be used for<lb/> compliance in any legally-binding GHG limitation scheme. There are a large number of such<lb/> standards operating, most of which issue unique unit types. All have different project certification<lb/> procedures and issuance procedures which have been reviewed elsewhere (<ref type="biblio">Kollmuss et al, 2010;<lb/> IETA, 2010a</ref>). The two largest international standards are the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) and<lb/> the Gold Standard (GS). The GS can also be used in conjunction with the CDM to generate GS-CERs,<lb/> but in effect this is a CER with a small price premium and need not be considered as an independent<lb/> unit.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of voluntary offsets aimed for use in specific countries, the main examples are in North<lb/> America. Until 2010, the Chicago Climate Exchange operated an offset system for its members, based<lb/> on the CFI unit (Carbon Financial Instrument). The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) now operates a<lb/> national voluntary offset system based on units called Climate Reserve Tonnes (CRT). CAR works<lb/> alongside the California Registry, and now the national Climate Registry, which provide protocols for<lb/> GHG reporting and databases for comparing performance data.<lb/> The notion of &apos;compliance&apos; is dependent on what is eligible for compliance in a particular jurisdiction<lb/> at a particular time. A unit that is &apos;compliance grade&apos; in one system may be used as a voluntary credit<lb/> to meet a company&apos;s self-imposed abatement goals in another jurisdiction. Over time, national or<lb/> regional legally-binding schemes may unilaterally change the rules of which units they accept for<lb/> compliance; an example is the recent EU decision to no longer accept certain types of CERs (EC,<lb/> 2011). The distinction between voluntary and compliance units is therefore complex and temporally<lb/> dynamic.<lb/></p>

			<p>For international GHG accounting up to 2012, the Kyoto Protocol only allows Kyoto units to be used<lb/> for international compliance. Voluntary offsets do not currently have a significant effect on Kyoto<lb/> accounting; nuances of this are discussed in Box 1.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1: Impacts of voluntary offset retirement on international GHG accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>With some exceptions, voluntary retirement of offsets to date can be split into three categories:<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Voluntary offsets created and consumed within the same annex B country</head>

			<p>will normally have<lb/> no impact on international GHG accounting. This is because the units are being transferred from one<lb/> entity to another within the national inventory. Complications may occur where the offset is allowed<lb/> for an emissions source or gas that is not covered under Kyoto. In this case, a real emissions reduction<lb/> is made that is &apos;invisible&apos; to the Kyoto inventory, because it is out of scope. The purchasing entity will<lb/> not make an equivalent reduction of its contribution to Kyoto gases, because it has purchased the<lb/> offset. Since voluntary offsets cannot be counted towards the accounting units that a country uses to<lb/> comply under Kyoto, this situation should not compromise international GHG accounting. Its effect<lb/> would be to make the country&apos;s compliance policy less effective, and make the challenge for that<lb/> country to meet its Kyoto target more difficult.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Voluntary</head>

			<figure>retirement of offsets created outside an annex B country but consumed within one<lb/> will also not affect Kyoto accounting. If</figure>

			<p>the offsets are VERs they cannot be used in place of AAUs to<lb/> aid a Party&apos;s compliance under Kyoto. The effect may be, however, to weaken the Annex B country&apos;s<lb/> prospects of achieving its Kyoto target, because if entities are content to purchase offsets to account<lb/> for their in-house emissions for reputational or other reasons, they may be less inclined to respond to<lb/> Government incentives put in place to reduce domestic emissions in order to achieve the Kyoto target.<lb/> A subset of this type of offset occurs where an entity in an Annex B country decides to buy Kyoto<lb/> compliant offsets such as CERs to meet its own voluntary corporate offset requirement (outside of any<lb/> Kyoto-linked scheme such as the EU ETS). In this case, the CERs are NOT transferred to the national<lb/> holding account of the country so they are NOT used for Kyoto compliance. To date this has been a<lb/> small market (<ref type="biblio">Ecosystem Marketplace, 2010</ref>). In future, this could in theory increase competition and<lb/> therefore price of CERs, which could in turn make meeting national commitments more expensive as<lb/> a whole. The increased cost of offsets would tend towards more domestic abatement in Annex I<lb/> countries and fewer offsets used for national commitments. This could make achieving national goals<lb/> more expensive, exacerbated by the tendency to inaction of a company that has voluntarily purchased<lb/> offsets. A similar competition effect may occur if non-Annex I countries were to purchase CERs to<lb/> meet their own mitigation pledges.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Voluntary offsets generated and consumed outside of Annex B countries</head>

			<p>clearly do not affect<lb/> the Kyoto accounting system as it currently stands. However, were some non-Annex B countries to be<lb/> brought into or linked to a UNFCCC allowance system in due course, there would be implications of<lb/> such offsets on international unit accounting.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Kyoto Protocol units accounting system<lb/></head>

			<p>The Kyoto Protocol introduced quantified emissions units for Annex I Parties for two main reasons:<lb/> (i) to ensure accurate tracking of emissions levels and therefore a clear means to demonstrate<lb/> compliance with commitments and (ii) to allow countries to meet mitigation targets more cost-<lb/>effectively through trading of units. To this end the Protocol introduced three flexibility mechanisms 6 .<lb/> Without this units-based system, compliance with national mitigation targets could have been<lb/> demonstrated through ex-post publication of National Inventory Reports 7 . Trading of units is<lb/> therefore an integral part of the Kyoto system, including AAUs and the project-based credits (CERs<lb/> and ERUs). The decisions adopted at Cancún contain references to a potential second commitment<lb/> period of the Kyoto Protocol as well as to new market mechanisms. Any future international<lb/> emissions limitation mechanism is therefore likely to maintain these provisions for trading and will<lb/> require quantifiable, verifiable, traceable emissions units.<lb/> This section gives a brief overview of the processes in place to handle Kyoto Protocol units; further<lb/> details of the system are described in the annex.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.1 Institutions and structure<lb/></head>

			<p>Figure 2 outlines the current Kyoto unit exchange system. At the heart of the system is the<lb/> International Transaction Log (ITL), a database that both pre-approves and logs all transactions of<lb/> Kyoto-compliant units. This includes initial issuance (creation) and trading of AAUs, issuance and<lb/> trading of CERs, conversion and trading of ERUs and retirement of all unit types for compliance.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Units themselves are held in National Kyoto Registries, databases hosted by each Annex B Kyoto<lb/> Party but conforming to standard specifications. These registries are linked to one another via the ITL.<lb/> Non-Annex I Parties do not have Kyoto registries. The UNFCCC hosts the CDM Registry, also linked<lb/> to the ITL, into which CERs are issued on behalf of successful CDM projects in non-Annex I<lb/> countries. JI projects are different in that ERUs are converted from AAUs in the host country. JI<lb/> projects can either be track 1, whereby the host country itself approves the project and converts AAUs<lb/> to ERUs, or track 2, where the UN approves each project and authorises conversion to ERUs.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The system is designed to be able to interact with sub-national unit registry systems for domestic<lb/> emissions trading schemes. The only active example of this is the EU&apos;s Community Independent<lb/> Transaction Log (CITL), which serves to link the EU ETS to the Kyoto system (this is shown in<lb/> <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> as a &apos;Domestic ETS Registry&apos;). Currently, each European Allowance (EUA) has been<lb/> converted from an AAU, so in fact both the CITL and ITL track all EUA movements. The EU<lb/> Registry system is set to change substantially from 1 January 2012 and EUAs will no longer be<lb/> directly coupled to AAUs; this is in part to facilitate the inclusion in the EU ETS of international<lb/> aviation emissions which are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol. This is described in detail in the<lb/> annex to this paper. Box 2 below also provides more information on registries and transaction logs.<lb/></p>

In specific cases a Kyoto base year other than 1990 is used for certain Parties and for certain gases.<lb/> 4. Transactions of non-Kyoto units (eg VERs) are not tracked by the ITL and are not shown for simplicity.<lb/> Box 2: What&apos;s in a name? Registries and transaction logs<lb/> The Oxford English Dictionary defines a registry as a place where registers or records are kept; an<lb/> official list or register. Under the UNFCCC, there are two main uses of the term registry: existing<lb/> GHG unit registries and the forthcoming registry for listing Nationally Appropriate Mitigation<lb/> Actions (NAMAs).<lb/> Unit registries: Under the Kyoto Protocol, the term registry usually refers to a database used to list<lb/> quantities of GHG units held by governments or entities. Each registry contains distinct accounts to<lb/> hold quantities of units, similar to bank accounts. One entity can hold multiple accounts in the same<lb/> registry. National registries are hosted by Annex I governments, whilst the CDM registry is hosted by<lb/> the UNFCCC.<lb/> Under regional emissions trading schemes such as the EU ETS, unit registries serve a similar purpose<lb/> for listing GHG units belonging to different entities. Currently EU ETS units are held in dedicated<lb/> accounts within national Kyoto registries, but after 2011 the ETS registries will exist separately.<lb/> Voluntary offset systems also operate registry systems with a similar account-based structure. These<lb/> are usually hosted by independent registry companies.<lb/> NAMA registry: The COP 16 decisions outline a registry for NAMAs. As currently described, this<lb/> would be very different to the existing Kyoto unit registries. It would not hold GHG units, but would<lb/> act as a service to facilitate matching funding with recipients. The COP 16 decision invites Parties to<lb/> submit information and the UNFCCC Secretariat to regularly update the registry, but modalities and<lb/> procedures have not yet been defined.<lb/></table>

			<figure>The international transaction log (ITL) is an electronic system administered by the UNFCCC and<lb/> hosted by independent contractors. The ITL acts as an electronic gateway for all transactions under<lb/> the Kyoto system, first approving and then recording details of each transaction between registries.<lb/> The Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which will become the EU Transaction Log<lb/> (EUTL) in 2012, serves a similar function for the EU ETS.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.3.2 Allocation of AAUs<lb/></head>

			<p>National allocation of AAUs for Annex B Parties is based on the National Inventory Reports for the<lb/> specified base year. Countries multiply base year emissions by their reduction target in order to set a<lb/> fixed quantity of AAUs for the Commitment Period, which are then issued into the national registry<lb/> accounts. This transaction is logged by the ITL, which acts to both record and approve the transaction.<lb/> This is a simplification of the reality, which also involves issuance of Removal Units (RMUs) for<lb/> land-use based sequestration of emissions according to complex accounting rules. RMUs exist to<lb/> account for forestry and land-use activities that sequester emissions in Annex B countries and<lb/> therefore act to lower net national GHG emissions; see annex for details.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.3 Trading of AAUs and credits<lb/></head>

			<p>Transactions for units pertaining to each of the flexibility mechanisms can only occur if they are<lb/> logged and approved by the ITL. If countries wish to exchange AAUs or ERUs from JI projects<lb/> (which are effectively equivalent to AAUs), the relevant national registries will initiate the transaction<lb/> but it cannot be completed until the ITL verifies the transaction and allows it to proceed. The same is<lb/> true for transactions of CERs either between Parties or from the CDM Registry to a Party&apos;s registry.<lb/> In this way the ITL is a safeguard against fraudulent exchange of official Kyoto units.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.4 Compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>Annex B Parties submit annual standard reporting forms (known as Standardised Electronic Format<lb/> tables, SEF) which depict their holdings of all Kyoto unit types as well as transactions occurring<lb/> during the year. In theory this could be at least partially validated using the transaction logs of the<lb/> ITL. At the end of the true up period after the commitment period, Parties submit and retire a quantity<lb/> of units equal to the total of their verified emissions for the years of the commitment period, by<lb/> transferring units to retirement accounts. This can also be done during the commitment period, and of<lb/> course each movement is approved and logged by the ITL. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows an example of how units<lb/> may be submitted for the entire commitment period.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Strengths and weaknesses of the Kyoto framework<lb/></head>

			<p>In summary, the Kyoto Protocol framework described above provides a number of attributes for GHG<lb/> unit accounting:<lb/>  A means for countries to demonstrate progress against mitigation commitments;<lb/>  A transparent way to translate an overall environmental objective into country<lb/> commitments;<lb/>  Common accounting rules for calculating and comparing commitments and for using<lb/> flexible market mechanisms;<lb/>  A standard accounting unit allowing countries to trade over-or under-achievement of<lb/> pledges directly, through international emissions trading;<lb/>  Equivalence of offset units through the existing flexibility mechanisms.<lb/> However, the existing framework is rigid in the way that it defines commitments by Annex B Parties<lb/> and this has prompted a number of countries to look for more flexible ways of approaching<lb/> commitments in future periods. Furthermore, the flexibility mechanisms are tightly defined and<lb/> require specific procedures that have contributed to their limited effectiveness at addressing<lb/> mitigation in sectors such as transport and household emissions (<ref type="biblio">Ellis and Kamel, 2007</ref>).<lb/> The following sections consider how a revised Kyoto system may compare to other frameworks to<lb/> deliver these positive attributes for unit accounting, whilst also seeking to provide greater flexibility<lb/> for achieving country objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Scenarios for a post-2012 accounting framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Irrespective of whether the Kyoto Protocol enters a second commitment period, the post-2012<lb/> framework is likely to be more complex than the existing system due to two key factors. Firstly, the<lb/> introduction of national mitigation goals and pledges from some non-Annex I countries may<lb/> complicate the international accounting of GHG units. Secondly, there is likely to be an increase of<lb/> GHG unit types being created and traded internationally. In addition, some existing domestic and<lb/> 8<lb/></p>

			<p>This is a simplification and does not address complexity in the calculation of land-use emissions<lb/> 22<lb/> regional emissions policy tools have already begun to stretch the boundaries of the Kyoto accounting<lb/> system; for example, the EU ETS will include international aviation emissions from 2012, which are<lb/> not accounted for under Kyoto.<lb/> This section puts forward an illustrative framework for grouping countries based on pledge type. It<lb/> goes on to suggest a range of scenarios for the basic structure of international GHG accounting after<lb/> 2012 and presents two options in more detail. The two scenarios have two fundamental differences:<lb/> firstly, whether or not Annex I countries agree to continue to participate in a compliance regime based<lb/> on international tradable emissions allowance units; secondly, whether or not the UNFCCC continues<lb/> to manage a centralised tracking and approval gateway for exchange of GHG units. These two models<lb/> represent scenarios of centralised and decentralised options for managing GHG units after 2012. The<lb/> final outcome may be a &apos;middle ground&apos; situation that involves elements of both models, and<lb/> possibilities for this are discussed in section 6.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Three groups of country mitigation pledges or commitments<lb/></head>

			<p>Many countries put forward inscriptions to the Copenhagen Accord containing mitigation goals or<lb/> pledged actions, which were formalised after COP16 in Cancún in UNFCCC &apos;INF&apos; documents<lb/> (UNFCCC 2011a, UNFCCC 2011b). Most Annex I Parties put forward quantified economy-wide<lb/> absolute emission reduction targets. Goals put forward by non-Annex I Parties are very diverse in<lb/> nature. Some countries have stated goals to reduce emissions intensity over all or part of the economy<lb/> (e.g. China, India). Other countries have listed goals to limit emissions to a quantified deviation from<lb/> expected business-as-usual emissions growth (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia). Many countries have stated<lb/> discrete voluntary actions that may or may not have a direct effect on emissions abatement. Costa<lb/> Rica and the Maldives have put forward a goal to become &apos;carbon neutral&apos; by a certain date. A<lb/> number of analyses have looked at the implications of pledges made by non-Annex I countries<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Dellink et al, 2010; Project Catalyst, 2010; Casella et al, 2010</ref>).<lb/> This paper therefore considers three different groups of countries based on their national mitigation<lb/> commitments, goals or pledged actions. This is not intended to replace the current Annex I / non<lb/> Annex I distinction, but is proposed for illustrative purposes to aid analysis.<lb/>  Annex I countries: absolute economy-wide reduction or limitation targets, which may or may<lb/> not be translated into quantified amounts for allocation of international allowance units;<lb/>  &apos;Group A&apos; Non-Annex I: Parties with quantified mitigation goals, either economy-wide or for<lb/> stated sectors: could be calculated as a goal for reduction in intensity relative to a base-year,<lb/> as deviation from a pre-established business-as-usual trajectory or as an intention to become<lb/> &apos;carbon neutral&apos;;<lb/>  &apos;Group B&apos; Non-Annex I: Parties with discrete pledged actions: could involve actions with<lb/> direct measureable GHG impacts (either autonomous or through international finance, or<lb/> directly financed through carbon credits) or more general policy changes with environmental<lb/> benefits including emissions.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the scenarios put forward in this paper, procedures for measurement, reporting and verification<lb/> (MRV) of emissions, both domestically and internationally, follow the framework laid out in the<lb/> decision adopted at COP 16 in Cancún. Annex I Parties currently deliver regular national<lb/> communications and annual national inventory reports, and this system is assumed to continue. In<lb/> addition, the COP 16 decisions stipulate that all Parties should prepare biennial reports, that<lb/> international assessment and review (IAR) will be conducted of emissions and removals related to<lb/> emission reduction targets for developed countries, and that international consultations and analysis<lb/> (ICA) will be conducted of biennial reports from developing countries.<lb/> 23<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 The range of possibilities for unit accounting post-2012<lb/></head>

			<p>Under this model of three country groups, the requirements for international accounting of GHG units<lb/> can be broken down into a number of building blocks as follows:<lb/>  The system used for monitoring and demonstrating achievement of Annex I commitments;<lb/></p>

			<p> The system used to track international movement of GHG units used for meeting<lb/> commitments;<lb/>  The flexibility mechanisms used to generate GHG credits internationally;<lb/>  The accounting system used for non-Annex I countries in &apos;group A&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>From these building blocks, a range of models for GHG unit accounting are possible, ranging from<lb/> highly centralised top-down models, to country-led, fully bottom-up approaches (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Given the<lb/> current state of UNFCCC negotiations the options at either extreme of the spectrum are not<lb/> considered to be likely outcomes. Two scenarios for a post-2012 unit accounting framework are<lb/> therefore explored, at the edges of what is likely to be the feasible range of the spectrum. One<lb/> scenario is a continuation of the Kyoto Protocol for some Annex I countries, with international<lb/> allowance units and continuation of the ITL; this is described in section 3.2.1. The second scenario<lb/> has no common allowance units for Annex I countries and achievement of objectives is demonstrated<lb/> in a &apos;pledge and review&apos; system, described in section 3.2.2. The details of how GHG unit flows<lb/> would occur are considered in Section 5 of the paper.

			<p>Decreasing centralisation of accounting framework<lb/> 24<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1 An allowance-based world – Kyoto Protocol for some Annex I<lb/></head>

			<p>This model assumes a continuation of the Kyoto Protocol into a new commitment period, but with<lb/> some Annex I Parties choosing to not participate in the allowance system. These countries would<lb/> nevertheless remain in Annex I, and options for how they might connect to the unit system are<lb/> discussed in section 5.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the main structural elements of this scenario; a more detailed discussion of this<lb/> accounting framework, including the types of units and their movements units is included in section 5<lb/> (the only unit movement shown in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref> is that of allowance units, as they are central to the model).<lb/></p>

			<p>Under this scenario, Annex I countries would continue to provide national communications and<lb/> national inventory reports under the UNFCCC, as well as biennial reports as described in the COP 16<lb/> decisions. In addition, Annex I countries participating in the Kyoto system would be required to<lb/> submit annual reports on their holdings and transactions of GHG units, similar to the existing Kyoto<lb/> Protocol reporting requirements (see annex). Annex I countries not participating in the allowance<lb/> system would have responsibility for demonstrating progress towards meeting their national objective<lb/> through their inventory reporting, with supplementary information on holdings and net transfers of<lb/> units. Developing countries would continue to provide NCs and, according to capabilities, biennial<lb/> reports including information on progress on implementation of stated mitigation goals.<lb/> The ITL would remain under control of the UNFCCC. Annex I Parties would maintain registries to<lb/> UN specifications, connected to the ITL. Annex I countries participating in the allowance system<lb/> would continue to issue allowances into their registry based on an assigned amount calculated from a<lb/> reduction relative to a base year. The assigned amount would be reviewed by international reviewers.<lb/> Allowances could then be traded between registries (via the ITL), and sub-national mechanisms can<lb/> be introduced and could potentially be backed-up by international allowances.<lb/> Developing countries in &apos;group A&apos; would submit any national goal according to their preferred<lb/> calculation method. They would present inventory and unit information to the UNFCCC at an<lb/> appropriate level of detail, and this would form the basis for demonstrating progress towards<lb/> implementation of mitigation goals. In some cases, distinct sectors will be excluded from the<lb/> international mitigation goal 9 , and these are depicted as a triangle in this diagram.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under this scenario, UNFCCC institutions would continue to act as the main regulator and issuer of<lb/> offset credits, under CDM and new mechanisms, as well as being the central point of reference for<lb/> other national creditable actions, for example under a Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and<lb/> Degradation (REDD) or REDD+ 10 programme. However, some countries may nevertheless initiate<lb/> bilateral offset agreements in addition to the UNFCCC, and options for how this could be integrated<lb/> are discussed further in section 5.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2 A country-led world: &apos;pledge and review&apos;<lb/></head>

			<p>This model involves no common allowance units for Annex I countries. Although some countries may<lb/> continue to operate regional trading schemes with allowance units, these would not be common to all<lb/> Annex I Parties. The basic structure of such a system is shown in <ref type="figure">figure 6</ref>; the model contains<lb/> elements of commonality between Parties and so is not the fully fragmented scenario at the far right of<lb/> <ref type="figure">figure 4</ref>. Section 5 describes the system in more detail, including the types of units and their flows.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under this scenario, commitments from Annex I countries would be based on pledges inscribed under<lb/> UNFCCC, and Annex I Parties would be requested to demonstrate progress towards and achievement<lb/> of their pledges through reporting of actions. Requirements for Annex I and non-Annex I Party<lb/> 9<lb/></p>

			<p>For example, India&apos;s mitigation goals inscribed under the Copenhagen Accord specifically exclude<lb/> emissions from agriculture from the overall intensity reduction goal<lb/> 10 REDD+ projects also involve measures for conservation, sustainable management of forests and<lb/> enhancement of forest carbon stocks. REDD(+) is used in this paper as shorthand for &quot; REDD or REDD+ &quot;<lb/> reporting to the UNFCCC would also remain broadly as described in the Cancún decisions, although<lb/> extra provision for reporting of unit movements would be required (<ref type="biblio">Ellis et al, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Without common allowance units, UNFCCC institutions would take a less central role in<lb/> administering GHG units. Under this scenario the ITL would cease to operate and the UNFCCC is no<lb/> longer responsible for the recording and overall control of GHG units. However, a GHG unit offset<lb/> and trading system can only reliably operate if all unit transfers are traceable in some capacity.<lb/> Therefore an independent tracking system might be necessary; this is depicted as the black frame,<lb/> outside of the UNFCCC. This would be a means of recording transaction details, but is not a registry<lb/> where units would be held; nor is it a gateway for approval of all transactions in the way that the ITL<lb/> currently operates. Elements of how this could function are discussed in section 5.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Accounting for tradable offset and credit units after 2012<lb/></head>

			<p>Under both scenarios put forward above, it is likely that crediting mechanisms – existing or new –<lb/> will continue to provide a cost effective means for Annex I countries to supplement domestic<lb/> mitigation with purchase of international units, as well as providing developing countries with a<lb/> revenue source and access to low emission technology. International credit or offset units could<lb/> provide a link between countries with the different types of pledge described above, even in the<lb/> absence of a common international allowance unit. This section explores what form these mechanisms<lb/> might take and what international units they might generate.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Evidence for increasing divergence of credit types<lb/></head>

			<p>The existing international climate change policy framework contains examples of bilateral or<lb/> unilateral domestic credit types already in operation, in pending legislation or at the planning stage.<lb/> Some of these are presented here as examples of how unit types might develop after 2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bilateral units for offsets set up between specific countries<lb/></head>

			<p>As there is still uncertainty around the post-2012 accounting framework for offsets, some countries<lb/> have indicated that they may pursue bilaterally-agreed offset mechanisms to help in meeting national<lb/> mitigation pledges. Such bilateral offset mechanisms would most likely operate in parallel with the<lb/> Kyoto mechanisms. To date, Japan has been most explicit about their intentions to develop bilateral<lb/> offset projects, with both the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry<lb/> actively pursuing feasibility studies for potential projects in a number of countries 11 . The revised EU<lb/> ETS Directive allows for the use of credits generated from projects or other emission reducing<lb/> activities implemented through direct agreements concluded with third countries (Article 11(a)5 of<lb/> Directive 2009/29/EC). However, depending on the extent of restrictions on certain categories of<lb/> offsets in the third phase of the EU ETS and whether the EU agrees to move to a 30% reduction<lb/> target, demand for such bilateral agreements from EU installations may be limited.<lb/> Establishing bilateral offset mechanisms could be motivated by inter alia:</p>

			<p>(i) the need to put in place<lb/> alternative mechanisms in case existing mechanisms are discontinued (and associated first-mover<lb/> advantages of doing so early); (ii) lower transaction costs of generating and trading offsets (as<lb/> bilateral offset mechanisms would not necessarily follow the same processes as UNFCCC<lb/> mechanisms); (iii) the possibility of developing offsets from sectors or project types currently not<lb/> eligible under existing mechanisms, e.g. nuclear power and (iv) the need for increased supply of offset<lb/> credits to meet ambitious mitigation commitments.<lb/> 27<lb/></p>

			<head>US sub-national offsets for regional cap and trade schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>While US federal legislation on cap and trade is currently on hold, regional initiatives continue. The<lb/> Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the north-eastern states has been operating since 2009<lb/> and is currently the only functioning GHG trading scheme in the US. It allows for international offsets<lb/> only once a &apos;trigger price&apos; of $10/ton has been reached; this has not yet occurred. The Western<lb/> Climate Initiative (WCI) covers potential trading schemes in a number of US states and Canadian<lb/> provinces. By far the largest is in California, where the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006<lb/> (AB32) describes a cap and trade scheme. This overcame legislative challenges in 2011 and is due to<lb/> start in 2012 12 . Should it go ahead, this scheme would allow for using non-UNFCCC-certified<lb/> international offsets to supplement US domestic offsets. Other sub-national or state-level policies that<lb/> allow for offsets include the Oregon CO 2 law (with a possibility for international offsets) and the<lb/> Alberta GHG Reduction Programme (with offsets from within the province only).<lb/> The AB32 in California has established protocols to allow for the use of offsets from REDD, and<lb/> bilateral cooperation with states in other countries has been initiated for that purpose. It is also<lb/> possible that new regional or federal emissions trading systems in the US could include greenhouse<lb/> gases not included in the existing Kyoto basket of gases. This may include black carbon aerosols, and<lb/> inclusion of such gases may complicate overall pledge accounting. The implications of offsets<lb/> designed specifically for sub-national compliance schemes operating outside of an international units<lb/> system are discussed in section 4.4.<lb/></p>

			<figure>EU Domestic offsets (under Art.24a of the EU ETS directive)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The EU ETS allows for putting in place a Community offset mechanism that may result in the<lb/> generation of allowances for EU ETS compliance or credits for compliance under the Effort Sharing<lb/> Decision (decision No 406/2009/EC). This has not yet become operational in the EU ETS as it<lb/> requires development of harmonised EU-wide rules. Article 24a of the ETS Directive states that<lb/> measures for issuing allowances or credits in respect of projects administered by Member States that<lb/> reduce greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the Community scheme may be adopted (EU, 2009).<lb/> If these units are developed and used in the same country, in order to maximise mitigation in the non-<lb/>traded sectors, then they are unlikely to have any bearing on international unit accounting because<lb/> both the offset provider and buyer fall under the same emissions inventory scope. However, if in a<lb/> bottom-up world these domestic offsets are developed and are tradable between EU countries or with<lb/> other schemes in non-European countries, then this could have an important effect on comparison and<lb/> effectiveness of national pledges. In this case the monitoring of transactions outside of the UN<lb/> becomes increasingly critical.<lb/></p>

			<head>Unit types based on metrics other than GHG<lb/></head>

			<p>There are an increasing number of policy mechanisms around the world that contribute to climate<lb/> change mitigation but are not measured directly in terms of GHG reduction or avoidance. Some of<lb/> these mechanisms create tradable units in other metrics, and it is possible that countries may in future<lb/> want to link these to international GHG unit mechanisms. Examples of units currently under<lb/> development that could fall into this category are the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme in<lb/> India, which will trade certificates in energy efficiency, and renewable energy obligation certificates<lb/> in a number of countries. The Tokyo cap and trade scheme, in particular, allows renewable energy<lb/> certificates to be used as offsets in a GHG trading scheme (<ref type="biblio">Tokyo Municipal Government, 2010</ref>).<lb/> The key inter-related issues in each case will be conversion factors and environmental integrity. For<lb/> conversion, an algorithm must be developed and, to allow the mechanism to link, be agreed<lb/> internationally. In the case of renewable energy, CDM procedures for calculating the emissions factor<lb/> for an electricity grid could be used and then updated dynamically. In Tokyo, a standard conversion<lb/> 28<lb/> factor for quantifying GHG reductions from renewable energy has been published (personal<lb/> communication with Yuko Nishida, Tokyo Metropolitan Government; publication in Japanese only).<lb/> For energy efficiency the case is more complex, because the efficiency certificates are likely to be<lb/> fungible across all energy use types, with no link to any particular GHG emitting sources 13 (contrary<lb/> to renewable electricity, which is linked to conventional power generation). A decision would have to<lb/> be made to use either the average GHG intensity of energy across the entire economy, or across the<lb/> industrial sectors covered by PAT. In either case, the decision would be rather arbitrary and may<lb/> cause concern for the environmental integrity of any scheme that it may link to.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Offsets for meeting national commitments after 2012<lb/></head>

			<p>Potential offset types to be used for meeting national commitments under the two scenarios described<lb/> in section 3 vary according to their governance structure, the type of unit and the implication for GHG<lb/> accounting in &apos;group A&apos; developing countries. Some of these unit types already exist, such as the<lb/> Kyoto Protocol project mechanisms. Others are new concepts without direct precedents, such as<lb/> sectoral crediting mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<p>These offset credits could range from continued UN regulation of CDM credits as in the pre-2012<lb/> system, to decentralised options with countries bilaterally agreeing and regulating offset and crediting<lb/> systems. For the former, the CDM could continue even in the absence of a Kyoto Protocol<lb/> commitment period. Such a credit system operated by the UN has the advantage of building on<lb/> experience gained with the flexible mechanisms to date, and maintaining an already-established and<lb/> valued emissions &apos;currency&apos;. Pursuing an international standard such as CDM would help to avoid the<lb/> build-up of a large dominance in the market by a standard pertaining to one particular country, and<lb/> could help to stabilise GHG markets by smoothing the linking of domestic trading schemes.<lb/> CDM is predominantly a project-based mechanism with each project requiring individual approval by<lb/> the UN-elected Executive Board 14 . Although important efficiency improvements have been made in<lb/> this process, including introducing elements of standardisation, some practitioners suggest that<lb/> significant and challenging reform is still required (IETA, 2010b). This regulatory structure may<lb/> prevent expansion of CDM to become the major international credit mechanism after 2012. New<lb/> market mechanisms with a regulatory structure more directed towards large-scale mitigation, with the<lb/> possibility to include host country mitigation efforts through the use of ambitious crediting baselines,<lb/> may become the prevalent credit mechanism after 2012. An example could be sector-wide crediting<lb/> approaches in specific industry sectors, which could still function under UN authority (<ref type="biblio">Baron et al,<lb/> 2009</ref>).<lb/> A fully fragmented system would involve each country or region establishing its own system and<lb/> rules for receiving credits or offsets from other countries. Each &quot; demand centre &quot; would need to find<lb/> agreement on procedures and protocols with each &quot; supply centre &quot; . This multiplication of systems<lb/> would likely raise transaction costs and limit economies of scale in the offset market. There may of<lb/> course be a hybrid situation whereby the CDM continues to operate in certain sectors and countries,<lb/> whilst other offset or credit standards develop alongside it.<lb/></p>

			<head>30<lb/> 4.3 Emissions accounting in developing countries<lb/></head>

			<p>As described in section 3, a number of non-Annex I countries have stated mitigation goals in a variety<lb/> of different ways. These pledges are understood to be put forward autonomously without intention for<lb/> them to be quantified and compared internationally. Accounting rules do not currently exist for such<lb/> comparison of non Annex I emissions, and no non-Annex I country has proposed its inclusion in a<lb/> common allowance system after 2012. Furthermore, many such mitigation actions are defined as<lb/> being dependent on provision of support and resources from developed countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>This does not mean that a common allowance unit system is incompatible with developing country<lb/> pledges, as described in the Kyoto Protocol model put forward above. However, the voluntary and<lb/> non-binding nature of the non-Annex I pledges means that there is potential for misunderstanding and<lb/> possible double counting of emissions reductions achieved through offset mechanisms hosted in those<lb/> countries, if they are subsequently used to help meet developed country objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3.1 Double counting of reductions from offset mechanisms<lb/></head>

			<p>There are two ways that offset mechanisms could lead to double counting. The first is if a single<lb/> emissions reduction action is credited by two or more different offset or other mechanisms. This can<lb/> be avoided through ensuring rigorous standards for all mechanisms that could be used to help meet a<lb/> national objective, and by employing an international tracking system for unit transactions. The<lb/> second way is if an emissions reduction is counted towards the emissions pledges of both host and<lb/> buyer countries. This latter issue is the focus of this section and has also been analysed in other recent<lb/> studies (<ref type="biblio">Levin et al, 2010; Erickson and Lazarus, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Up until 2012, national accounting of GHG units is only mandatory for Annex I countries and this<lb/> means that CDM projects can be assessed for the key criteria of baseline and additionality on a<lb/> project-by-project basis, without need to reference the impact of the project on wider sectoral and<lb/> national emissions in the developing country hosting the project. The emergence of emissions<lb/> limitation pledges by some developing countries, and their subsequent formalisation at COP16, means<lb/> that this project-by-project isolation may no longer be appropriate because of a risk of double<lb/> counting of emissions reductions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The possibility of double counting arises because of different interpretations of two main factors: (i)<lb/> how non-Annex I emissions mitigation pledges are to be accounted for internationally and (ii) the<lb/> conditionality of these pledges on international finance and other support. Communications delivered<lb/> to the UNFCCC and published after COP16 reveal that most developing countries see these pledges<lb/> as goals based on economic output that are dependent on financial and technological support from<lb/> developed countries (UNFCCC, 2011). The eventual achievement of the goal is usually seen as non-<lb/>binding internationally. Therefore, countries may see incoming financial flows for emissions<lb/> reduction activities, such as those used to purchase CERs from CDM projects, as helping them to<lb/> meet this goal regardless of the subsequent use of the emissions reductions credits pertaining to those<lb/> projects to meet Annex I reduction targets. Annex I countries, however, may see non-Annex I<lb/> commitments to be more similar in nature to their own future commitments, whether or not there is<lb/> renewal of the Kyoto Protocol&apos;s commitment period.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I country commitments are binding and, crucially, each tonne of<lb/> GHG emitted must be accounted for with an AAU or other unit. By this logic, if an emissions<lb/> reduction credit from a non-Annex I country is used to help meet an Annex I target, then that credit<lb/> should not be available for the non-Annex I host country to count towards its abatement. The same<lb/> can be argued for a system without a common allowance unit for developed countries; even under<lb/> such a system developed countries may still have an international obligation to demonstrate both that<lb/> their emissions reduction target has been met and what proportion of international credits were used to<lb/> achieve it. On the other hand, a developing country may argue that their pledge is based on<lb/> macroeconomic outputs and achievement of the overall emissions goal is not dependent on any<lb/> mechanisms used to achieve it. This would mean that any emissions reductions that occur in the<lb/> country would count towards achievement of the developing country&apos;s pledge, no matter if the<lb/> &apos;rights&apos; to the unit attached to the action have been sold as an offset.<lb/></p>

			<head>Relevance of finance to double counting of offset emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>There are many forms of public and private sector financial flows originating in developed countries<lb/> and aimed at stimulating climate change mitigation in developing countries (<ref type="biblio">Corfee-Morlot et al,<lb/> 2009</ref>). Only part of this financial support is likely to come from carbon market mechanisms, of which<lb/> a small subset is direct purchase of offsets 15 (<ref type="biblio">AGF, 2010</ref>).<lb/> This carbon offset revenue is used to purchase GHG units that are relevant to international GHG<lb/> accounting, and for this reason it can be considered distinct from other financial support and<lb/> investment. Blurring the distinction between these sources of finance is partly what leads to the<lb/> disagreements about alleged double counting of CERs. If revenue received from CER purchase is<lb/> considered part of committed Annex I country financial support on which &apos;group A&apos; developing<lb/> country pledges are conditional, there would not be an argument for double counting of the emissions<lb/> reductions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The complexity of this distinction is highlighted by the financing of projects and readiness<lb/> programmes in land-use and forestry, and in particular REDD and REDD+, especially in the absence<lb/> of an international allowance unit. Some initiatives underway are clearly intended to entail only<lb/> climate finance without exchange of GHG units – such as the US commitment to &quot; fast-start &quot; finance<lb/> for REDD+ schemes 16 (<ref type="biblio">USAID, 2010</ref>). Other initiatives under early stages of planning may involve<lb/> financing by developed country governments of REDD+ programmes in developing countries, with<lb/> the resulting avoided emissions expected to be considered as part of the donor country&apos;s mitigation<lb/> effort. Whilst this is not an offset mechanism in the conventional sense of the word, this type of<lb/> aggregate offsetting, without any distinct transfer of units, may cause considerable challenges for<lb/> international GHG accounting in the absence of an international GHG allowance unit system.<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue of distinguishing offset markets from climate financing is further highlighted in policy<lb/> statements made by Indonesia in relation to its mitigation pledge of a 26% reduction from business as<lb/> usual emissions through unilateral action, rising to 41% with international financial support 17 .<lb/> REDD(+) initiatives are expected to contribute significantly to this mitigation effort, but the pledge is<lb/> clear that this support does not include financing through carbon credit sales, thereby retaining the<lb/> distinction between financing and offset crediting. Other mitigation pledges are not clear about this<lb/> distinction.<lb/></p>

			<head>Options to address double counting of emissions reductions<lb/></head>

			<p>International double counting of offsets towards both host and buyer country pledges would mean that<lb/> global mitigation would be less than that implied by adding up national pledges at face value.<lb/> Quantitative modelling suggests that this effect could be significant (<ref type="biblio">Erickson and Lazarus, 2011</ref>).<lb/> However, the nature of emissions intensity pledges made by developing countries means that the final<lb/> environmental result is dependent on economic performance and is anyway uncertain; the double<lb/> counting or not of project-based emissions credits in developing countries is another element of<lb/> uncertainty in an already uncertain calculation. How this issue is resolved and how overall mitigation<lb/> is determined is a matter of political negotiation and is not the focus of this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>32<lb/></head>

			<p>If developing countries are clear about whether their stated pledge includes emissions reductions<lb/> achieved through international offset mechanisms, then emissions accounting can still be carried out.<lb/> Countries could also specify which particular offset mechanisms are assumed to be included in the<lb/> pledge, operating in certain economic sectors. That the resulting environmental outcome will likely be<lb/> less satisfactory is a serious matter and one that should be debated publicly, but it is one for political<lb/> negotiation rather than technical unit accounting. Furthermore, as Box 3 below highlights, the<lb/> magnitude of this effect arising from double counting of ongoing CDM credits issued after 2012 is<lb/> also dependent on clarification of developing country pledges; double counting from new mechanisms<lb/> is more uncertain.<lb/> Furthermore, the impact of double counting of CDM or other credits would also be dependent on<lb/> demand for the units. Demand for credits comprises not only the volumetric requirement implied by<lb/> the ambition of Annex I pledges and therefore of their underlying policy mechanisms such as the EU<lb/> ETS, but also of the type of credit that may be permitted for use within such schemes. In a Kyoto<lb/> world, all credits produced under the official mechanisms can be used to meet national compliance<lb/> targets, even if underlying compliance regimes like the EU ETS are restrictive. Under a less<lb/> centralised framework, Annex I countries could in theory specify in advance which credit types will<lb/> be sufficient to meet their pledge. Should some countries unilaterally decide to exclude offsets that<lb/> could be deemed to suffer from double counting in this way, demand for such credits may be<lb/> weakened to the point that developing countries have incentive to no longer apply for offset credits in<lb/> implicated sectors.<lb/></p>

			<table>Box 3: Potential double counting of CDM emissions reductions: the case of China<lb/> China&apos;s inscription to the Copenhagen Accord states that: &quot; China will endeavour to lower its carbon<lb/> dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45% by 2020 compared to the 2005 level, increase the share<lb/> of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 15% by 2020 and increase forest<lb/> coverage by 40 million hectares and forest stock volume by 1.3 billion cubic meters by 2020 from the<lb/> 2005 levels. &quot;<lb/> This wording implies that the mitigation goal is for CO 2 only (rather than all GHGs or the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol gases), although this has not been confirmed by the Chinese government. The intensity<lb/> metric, calculated relative to economy-wide GDP, is based on a single year, 2005. Since 2005 China<lb/> has had a domestic goal to reduce energy intensity by 20-25% by 2010, described in the 2005-2010<lb/> &apos;11th Five Year Plan&apos;. It is not yet clear how the new emissions intensity goal will add to this existing<lb/> energy intensity initiative combined with the non-fossil fuel and forestry goals mentioned above<lb/> (Project Catalyst 2010).<lb/> The scope of the pledge could have implications on CDM projects in China. If the goal is clarified as<lb/> being only based on CO 2 , this will have a bearing on the possibility of CDM double counting. 33% of<lb/> expected CERs up to 2020 from China are from predominantly non-CO 2 sources (of projects already<lb/> in the CDM pipeline, including HFCs, N 2 O, coal mine methane and landfill gas) (UNEP Risoe 2011).<lb/> These projects therefore would not be subject to double counting should the pledge cover only CO 2<lb/> (ignoring any other concerns over environmental integrity). Of the remaining CDM projects,<lb/> renewable energy projects cover c.47% of CERs expected to 2020. These have already faced<lb/> additionality challenges over tariff setting, particularly for wind and hydro projects. China&apos;s parallel<lb/> renewable energy target may add to this concern. The final 20% of CERs are expected from<lb/> predominantly (about 90% of remainder) fossil fuel switch and power generation using industrial<lb/> waste energy.<lb/></table>

			<p>As well as the possible double counting of emissions reductions, the nature of China&apos;s pledge<lb/> highlights a second issue for CDM: complications on assessing additionality when the project is<lb/> assessed in context of a package of national goals, particularly energy efficiency goals and renewable<lb/> energy targets. However, the energy efficiency goal has been in place since 2005 and, perhaps<lb/> because it is measured in energy intensity terms rather than carbon, has not caused any significant<lb/> conflict with CDM to date. Furthermore the 12 th Five Year Plan, adopted in March 2011, suggests that<lb/> cap-and-trade schemes may be initiated in some provinces, which may also have an impact on the<lb/> viability of CDM projects in covered sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>This example highlights many uncertainties, including uncertainty in the ambition of national pledges<lb/> relative to business-as-usual, and uncertainty in the interpretation of additionality for CDM in the<lb/> context of national pledges. Whilst GHG unit accounting is a technical issue addressed in this paper,<lb/> the interpretation and assessment of ambition within pledges is mostly a political issue<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3.2<lb/> CDM host country decisions on offset production and domestic use<lb/></head>

			<p>If developing countries with mitigation goals – those in &apos;group A&apos; in the above classification –<lb/> consider over time that their pledges are politically binding in their own countries, it is conceivable<lb/> that such countries may decide to purchase credits – either CERs or otherwise – from developing<lb/> countries in &apos;group B&apos;. The aim would be to help the &apos;group A&apos; countries achieve their stated pledges<lb/> if domestic abatement has been less than anticipated. This raises several issues:<lb/>  It would require &apos;group A&apos; developing countries to set up unit registries capable of receiving<lb/> the offsets concerned, or for registries to be established in other countries on their behalf;<lb/>  It would further highlight the double counting issue described above, in that countries could<lb/> be both generating and using the same type of offset;<lb/> 34<lb/>  The multi-directional flow of offsets complicates the global picture, where flows to date<lb/> have been mostly unidirectional from non-Annex I to Annex I countries 18 . If credits used<lb/> originate exclusively from &apos;group B&apos; countries then there would be not be an issue with<lb/> global GHG accounting, because countries in &apos;group B&apos; do not have any quantified<lb/> emissions goal. However the situation is more complex if credits are exchanged between<lb/> two &apos;group A&apos; countries. For example, if a country that is confident of exceeding its pledge<lb/> agrees to sell offsets to a second &apos;group A&apos; country concerned with a likely failure to meet<lb/> its goal. This could be challenging for maintaining international integrity of unit accounting.<lb/> To ensure that transactions are as transparent as possible, it would be desirable that any such<lb/> unit movements are recorded under an international system.<lb/></p>

			<p>These elements of uncertainty and political negotiation highlight further that whatever system is<lb/> adopted, it must include a reliable means to track the movement of GHG units between national<lb/> accounts. Within a Kyoto framework this can occur within national Kyoto registries tracked by the<lb/> ITL, but outside the Kyoto infrastructure and in the absence of the ITL this would be a key challenge<lb/> of maintaining a credible emissions accounting system, as described in section 5. The possibility of<lb/> the ITL servicing this purpose under a non-Kyoto system is discussed in section 6.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4 Impact of sub-national trading scheme offsets on global unit accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>Whether or not international obligations are managed by a system of common allowance units,<lb/> domestic emissions trading schemes are likely to be implemented in some regions covering some<lb/> economic sectors. Regardless of the form of the wider international unit accounting framework after<lb/> 2012, such sub-national trading schemes will be relevant to global accounting in two separate ways:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) the impact on national pledges from allowance units from sub-national schemes and (ii) offset units<lb/> created specifically for use in those trading schemes, domestic or international.<lb/></p>

			<p>Emissions trading is designed to direct mitigation to occur where it is most cost effective and<lb/> international linking of domestic or regional trading schemes will further enhance the economic<lb/> efficiency of this policy response (Ellis and Tirpak 2006). The standardisation of unit accounting and<lb/> offset protocols is expected to be a critical component in allowing schemes to link 19 (<ref type="biblio">Hood 2010</ref>). For<lb/> example, regions that have set strict standards would be unlikely to allow these to be undermined by<lb/> importing less stringent units from other schemes. Greater co-ordination of international standards<lb/> would therefore not only simplify the accounting of emissions, it could lower costs by allowing<lb/> trading schemes to link more easily.<lb/></p>

			<p>Offset units developed for sub-national schemes may become eligible for helping developed countries<lb/> to achieve their national mitigation targets, as indicated in section 4.1. A useful example to consider is<lb/> the forthcoming cap and trade scheme to be developed in California under the AB32 regulation.<lb/> REDD and other sector-based offset credits in foreign jurisdictions may be eligible for compliance by<lb/> entities within the scheme. In November 2010, an agreement was announced between the Governor of<lb/> California and Governors of two sub-national states in Brazil and Mexico (Point Carbon, 2010) to<lb/> supply REDD-based offsets to the Californian emissions trading scheme. REDD credits generated<lb/> and used in this way could therefore have an impact on both the interpretation of the host country<lb/> national mitigation pledges and on demonstrating achievement of the US abatement target, assuming<lb/> that it is not part of any future international allowance unit system.<lb/></p>

			<p>The host country governments will decide whether the credits sold from the provincial agreements<lb/> will be deducted from the national mitigation achievements or not, and that is a political issue. On the<lb/> technical side, it is important for overall global accounting that such credit sales should be recorded<lb/> and traceable in an international tracking system. For the US, these credits will have been purchased<lb/> by capped entities in the Californian scheme and submitted to the state regulator for compliance under<lb/> that scheme. Whatever position the US may take in a future international agreement, the developing<lb/> MRV regime is likely to increase pressure on all countries to demonstrate their achievement with their<lb/> targets or pledges. Even if outside of an international allowance trading regime, this requirement for<lb/> transparency will likely require some level of visibility on the credit units used.<lb/></p>

			<p>Further research will investigate how allowances and offsets from sub-national schemes can be<lb/> reliably integrated into international GHG accounting after 2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Integrating unit accounting into post-2012 scenarios<lb/></head>

			<p>The above analysis of divergent unit types highlights that whatever international emissions accounting<lb/> infrastructure prevails, maintaining the ability to track movements of emissions units after 2012 is key<lb/> to maintaining the environmental integrity of the system. This section builds on the scenarios<lb/> presented in section 3 to suggest structural options for how unit movements could be tracked both<lb/> with a common allowance system and in a pledge-and-review world. An initial exploration of the<lb/> middle ground between these two scenarios is presented in Section 6.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1 Unit accounting in a continued Kyoto Protocol system<lb/></head>

			<figure>Figure 7 builds on figure 5 to demonstrate how unit transactions might occur in a post-2012 world<lb/> based on common international allowances for some Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The basic structure for this model was described in section 3.2.1. In terms of unit transactions, the<lb/> key feature is the continuation of the ITL as a UN-controlled gateway, through which all UN-related<lb/> unit transactions must pass. Under this model, Annex I countries would only issue international<lb/> allowance units under UN supervision through the ITL, as is the case with Kyoto. Also, the<lb/> continuation of the ITL means that the CDM and JI mechanisms can effectively continue as they are,<lb/> although they might benefit from reforms to scale up and broaden the mechanisms, including<lb/> increased standardisation and use of programmatic frameworks. However, in <ref type="figure">figure 7</ref>, two types of<lb/> CDM project are shown in the example &apos;group A&apos; country: one from sectors included inside the<lb/> national pledge, one from a sector outside of the pledge. In time, CDM may only be pursued in the<lb/> latter type of sector, because of concerns over double counting of reductions. The ITL could also be<lb/> used for a new UN-controlled mechanism to issue credits for action beyond business-as-usual in<lb/> certain key sectors in &apos;group A&apos; countries (<ref type="biblio">Baron et al 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The UNFCCC will also operate a registry for nationally-approved mitigation actions (NAMAs) as<lb/> specified in the COP 16 decisions. The NAMA registry is not intended to be a unit registry. However,<lb/> the database could also in time develop to handle units – or be linked to the existing CDM unit<lb/> registry – should a system for issuing credits for emissions reductions from NAMAs be agreed, for<lb/> example credits from REDD(+) actions. Whether these projects would be subject to full UN approval,<lb/> with credits issued from a CDM-style central registry linked to the ITL, would be subject to<lb/> negotiation; ignoring political sensitivities, this model may provide a robust means of international<lb/> unit accounting of REDD projects.<lb/> Annex I countries would maintain registries to UN specifications, similar to existing registries in<lb/> Kyoto Parties. Under this post-2012 model, Annex I countries not participating in the common<lb/> allowance units system could also operate a UN-specified registry into which UN-managed units can<lb/> be purchased and stored for retirement 20 ; this would allow the UN-based offset mechanisms to be<lb/> more international and to have more liquidity, thereby encouraging economies of scale and greater<lb/> levels of mitigation. This registry could be used to make use of CDM and/or new REDD or other<lb/> credits to help achieve the national target, depending on the domestic policy choices of the country<lb/> involved. All UN registries would have live link-ups to the ITL for all Kyoto unit transactions, as in<lb/> the current system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under this scenario non-Annex I countries are not required to maintain UN unit registries, as is<lb/> currently the case. Some &apos;group A&apos; countries may choose to establish domestic registries to handle<lb/> 37<lb/> domestic offsets developed and used within the country to stimulate mitigation in new sectors. These<lb/> would probably not be tracked by the ITL. All other UN-managed units generated in &apos;group A&apos;<lb/> countries, including both CDM and potential future sectoral credits, would be issued into registries<lb/> hosted by the UN rather than the host country, as with current CDM. In time, domestic registries in<lb/> &apos;group A&apos; countries could be modified to serve to retire international offset units, for example from<lb/> &apos;group B&apos; countries, should those governments decide to use offsets to meet mitigation goals.<lb/> As described in section 4, Annex I countries not participating in the common allowance unit system<lb/> may choose to develop new specific unit types to help achieve their objectives. To ensure integrity of<lb/> the overall system these would need to be accounted for internationally even under this model. An<lb/> example might be provincial-level REDD credits as described in section 4.4, or independent national-<lb/>level bilateral offset schemes developed regardless of the continuing UNFCCC unit system; these are<lb/> shown by the dashed arrow in <ref type="figure">figure 7</ref>. It may be impossible to link these to a UN-controlled ITL, and<lb/> as a result there would be an onus on governments of the countries involved to ensure that non-UN<lb/> unit registries are developed that are transparent and can show aggregate unit use on a national level.<lb/> One solution may be for these countries to operate in effect two registries, or one registry with two<lb/> functions. This would complicate and possibly weaken the transparency of the overall system under<lb/> this model.<lb/></p>

			<p>The only other units not being tracked and verified by the ITL under this model would be voluntary<lb/> credits purchased by private entities outside of the international system (these are not shown for<lb/> clarity). Box 1 in section 2 shows that under a central allowance system, such voluntary credits do not<lb/> affect global GHG accounting.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Unit accounting in a pledge-and-review world<lb/></head>

			<figure>Figure 8 builds on figure 6 to show how unit transactions may be followed in a pledge and review<lb/> system without a common international allowance unit. The complexity inherent in maintaining<lb/> robust unit accounting in this scenario is one of the reasons why the middle ground option described<lb/> in section 6 may be a more likely outcome.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Unit types<lb/></head>

			<p>The basic structure of this scenario was described in section 3.2.2. The lack of a common international<lb/> allowance unit would result in a much less prominent role for the UNFCCC in unit issuance and<lb/> control. CDM may continue to operate in &apos;group B&apos; countries and in certain sectors in &apos;group A&apos;<lb/> countries, and this would operate through the existing process with the CDM Registry still operating.<lb/> All other offsets would be bilateral and issued under the authority of agreements between selling and<lb/> buying country governments, and these may or may not follow established international standards.<lb/> The UNFCCC could still play a critical role in defining minimum offset standards or common<lb/> principles, but acting as a guideline-or standard-setting body rather than a certification and approval<lb/> body. This is shown in <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref> and discussed further in section 6.<lb/></p>

			<p>Note: The diagram shows a schematic of a black frame with units movements passing through it, but in reality<lb/> the movements would pass directly between registries with a notification sent to the tracking system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Registries<lb/></head>

			<p>Annex I countries would maintain unit registries which may or may not be based on common UN<lb/> specifications (as their existing Kyoto registries are) to aid communication. &apos;Group A&apos; (non-Annex I)<lb/> countries could develop domestic registries from which to issue bilateral offsets or sector credits.<lb/> Without such a registry in the host &apos;group A&apos; country, unit movements would only be recorded as<lb/> issuances in the buyer country registry and may make accurate emissions accounting difficult. Given<lb/> that these countries have quantified mitigation goals, it may be considered important for registries to<lb/> be developed for these mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Group B&apos; countries (also non-Annex I) would not be expected to develop national registries. <ref type="figure">Figure 8<lb/></ref> also shows an example whereby offsets may be generated in &apos;group B&apos; countries outside of the CDM<lb/> to pre-existing offset standards, such as existing voluntary standards. If Annex I countries agree to use<lb/> the credits from such projects to meet their target, an independent private-sector registry – such as<lb/> those currently used in the voluntary offset market – could be used as the intermediary to issue and<lb/> transfer the units, in place of a national registry.<lb/></p>

			<p>One further example is illustrated by a question mark in the figure, whereby a bilateral agreement is<lb/> arranged between an Annex I and a &apos;group B&apos; country for an emissions reduction activity that will not<lb/> issue any precise units. For example, this could be a REDD+ project financed by an Annex I country,<lb/> with a certain quantity of emissions reductions measured, which would be used towards the Annex I<lb/> country pledge, without any units being created or passing through any registry. This is likely to<lb/> weaken overall transparency and may damage international trust in the integrity of the system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transaction tracking system<lb/></head>

			<p>Under this scenario an independent transaction unit tracking system may need to be developed.<lb/> Countries would need to agree, perhaps through UNFCCC COP decision, that any unit transaction<lb/> involving creation or international transfer of a unit that will be used to help meet a national pledge<lb/> should be recorded internationally. This could be through connection to a single central tracking<lb/> system, or through definition of a standard data format for registries with obligations to make data<lb/> available internationally; some potential examples from the financial sector are considered in section<lb/> 6 below.<lb/></p>

			<p>Transactions would not be pre-approved in the way that the ITL currently operates and for this reason<lb/> the tracking system is shown to be independent and operating outside of the UN. It is conceivable that<lb/> the ITL could continue to operate under a non-Kyoto scenario to fulfil only this tracking function, and<lb/> this is examined in section 6. However it is clear that, regardless of how the tracking system is<lb/> managed or operated, the governance concept is very different from the existing ITL with its role as a<lb/> gateway and approver (albeit automatically) of transactions. For the tracking to be done<lb/> independently, when countries demonstrate achievement of their stated pledges during and at the end<lb/> of a pledge period, a system could be developed for countries to submit a transaction report<lb/> comparing emissions data from the National Inventory Report with units held for retirement in each<lb/> country&apos;s specific registry; data can be checked against reports from the tracking system if necessary.<lb/> This model would be more flexible to individual requirements of Annex I countries so would<lb/> probably not suffer from the &quot; two-speed &quot; nature of a partial Kyoto Protocol system with some<lb/> countries not participating. However, it may pose a greater risk of fraudulent market behaviour due to<lb/> the decentralised nature of the accounting framework and tracking system.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3 Ensuring a functional unit accounting system<lb/></head>

			<p>Section 2.4 considered what functions are required of a reliable unit accounting system, including<lb/> those provided by the existing system, and those which are currently lacking or do not function well.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> compares a system based on a single common allowance unit to a system without such a unit,<lb/> for a range of desirable attributes of a functional accounting system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both types of system have advantages and disadvantages, and may be more or less attractive to<lb/> different countries. The most likely outcome may combine elements of both of these types of system,<lb/> and this is explored in section 6.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 4: Comparison with or without common allowances units<lb/> System based on common allowance unit<lb/> System with no common allowance unit<lb/> Defining<lb/> national<lb/> pledges or<lb/> commitments<lb/> Kyoto Protocol rules would be used to<lb/> assign<lb/> international<lb/> allowance<lb/> units<lb/> corresponding to participating Annex I<lb/> countries&apos; quantified emission reduction<lb/> targets. This system provides a clear<lb/> definition of commitments, but does not<lb/> allow much flexibility for country-specific<lb/> requirements 21 . Pledges from other countries<lb/> would be accounted for separately.<lb/></table>

			<p>A more decentralised system allows<lb/> countries increased flexibility to develop<lb/> baselines and objectives that fit with national<lb/> development goals, both for Annex I and<lb/> non-Annex I countries. However, without<lb/> some degree of harmonisation international<lb/> comparison could be difficult.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Demonstrating<lb/> progress<lb/> towards<lb/> mitigation<lb/> objectives<lb/> Annex I participating countries would<lb/> demonstrate progress through use of<lb/> international allowance units. Units created<lb/> in domestic or regional trading schemes in<lb/> these countries can be &apos;backed up&apos; by<lb/> international units (as per EU ETS). As other<lb/> countries (non-participating Annex I and<lb/> non-Annex I) would not be allocated<lb/> international allowances, a partial Kyoto<lb/> system does not in itself provide means to<lb/> demonstrate universal progress towards<lb/> implementation of pledges.<lb/> For Annex I, emissions data from National<lb/> Inventory Reports need to be combined with<lb/> domestic or offset units held in each<lb/> country&apos;s specific registry. This process<lb/> could become part of International<lb/> Assessment and Review (IAR), as initiated<lb/> in the Cancún Agreements. Clear<lb/> information<lb/> on<lb/> progress<lb/> towards<lb/> implementation of non-Annex I goals may<lb/> need a transparent system for tracking unit<lb/> movements.<lb/> Recognition of<lb/> increased<lb/> mitigation<lb/> action from<lb/> developing<lb/> countries<lb/></figure>

			<p>Currently, the Kyoto Protocol only allocates<lb/> allowances to countries with binding targets.<lb/> This system does not allow for a quantified<lb/> recognition of the actions of developing<lb/> countries. This would be overcome if<lb/> common allowance units were used by both<lb/> developed and developing countries, but this<lb/> is not likely to be acceptable in the time-<lb/>frame of a possible 2 nd commitment period<lb/> of the Kyoto Protocol.<lb/> A system without a common allowance<lb/> system may make it easier for developing<lb/> countries to increase their contribution to<lb/> global mitigation over time, without the step<lb/> change of joining an allowance scheme. The<lb/> lack of a strong distinction between<lb/> countries with allowance unit and those<lb/> without, may make it feasible for a larger<lb/> number of countries to adopt mitigation<lb/> objectives with similar terms.<lb/></p>

			<head>Role of the<lb/> UNFCCC and<lb/> international<lb/> institutional<lb/> requirements<lb/></head>

			<p>The UNFCCC could continue in its pre-2012<lb/> role plus operating both the NAMA registry<lb/> and a unit registry to administer units from<lb/> new UN-operated crediting mechanisms.<lb/> Existing UN institutions and processes<lb/> would form a solid basis for development,<lb/> including potentially to track new units used<lb/> by countries to help them meet mitigation<lb/> pledges.<lb/> A diminished role for UNFCCC in<lb/> regulating and issuing units, but Secretariat<lb/> may still play key role in defining minimum<lb/> standards for offsets for adoption by Parties.<lb/> Although UNFCCC may no longer control<lb/> the ITL in its current form, there may be a<lb/> role for the UNFCCC to continue<lb/> administering an independent tracking<lb/> system, as a means of recording transactions<lb/> (but not as a registry for holding units).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Transparency<lb/> of unit<lb/> accounting<lb/> A common allowance unit enables<lb/> comparisons<lb/> between<lb/> participating<lb/> countries, including offsets and allowance<lb/> units from domestic schemes. A common<lb/> international allowance unit would help to<lb/> prevent the differentiation of standards,<lb/> which could lead to different GHG units<lb/> holding widely different monetary value.<lb/> Such discrepancy in financial value of units<lb/> which are all intended to represent one tonne<lb/> of CO 2 -equivalent may raise questions about<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the absence of a common allowance unit,<lb/> accounting rules for defining pledges and<lb/> demonstrating achievement towards them<lb/> may become increasingly important to avoid<lb/> a reduction in transparency and a risk of<lb/> lowered environmental integrity. To<lb/> maintain comparability of divergent unit<lb/> types, robust tracking and reporting of unit<lb/> transactions is essential. The risk of banking<lb/> excess allowance units into a future period<lb/> could weaken environmental ambition and<lb/> 21 Note that negotiation of Kyoto Protocol accounting rules for LULUCF emissions allowed for some<lb/> flexibility based on country circumstances<lb/> 41<lb/> the environmental integrity of different<lb/> unit 22 . However, the allowance system itself<lb/> does not guarantee a high level of<lb/> transparency as this is dependent on<lb/> accounting rules for defining baselines and<lb/> targets/pledges.<lb/> this risk is avoided in a system without<lb/> allowance units.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ability to track<lb/> unit<lb/> transactions<lb/></head>

			<p>Allows all movements of international<lb/> allowance units, credit or offset units to be<lb/> approved and recorded by the ITL;<lb/> participating Annex I performance against<lb/> targets can be shown by submitting<lb/> allowances and credits for retirement in one<lb/> place. Use of the ITL as a single tracking<lb/> device may also reduce the risk of fraud in<lb/> international unit transactions. For countries<lb/> not participating in the international<lb/> allowance system, tracking of credit or<lb/> offset unit transactions would still be<lb/> required.<lb/> To ensure the integrity of a system with<lb/> multiple unit types created and regulated by<lb/> specific countries and not backed up by or<lb/> linked to international units, international<lb/> disclosure and recording of transactions<lb/> would be required. However, there are<lb/> examples from financial markets of systems<lb/> that make international transactions possible<lb/> and traceable without any central ITL-type<lb/> gateway. The SWIFT network for interbank<lb/> financial movements is one such example.<lb/> Furthermore, the ITL could still be<lb/> employed as a tracking device, without its<lb/> transaction approval function.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Integration of<lb/> national policy<lb/> mechanisms<lb/> and new unit<lb/> types<lb/></figure>

			<p>Under this model, allowance units from<lb/> domestic or regional trading schemes could<lb/> be backed up by international allowance<lb/> units, in the way that EU ETS units are<lb/> currently linked to AAUs. This would<lb/> simplify integration of new unit types and a<lb/> direct link to national policy mechanisms.<lb/> Units not based on CO 2 which may be<lb/> introduced through developing country<lb/> policies – such as energy efficiency or<lb/> renewable energy credits – could be<lb/> integrated to the allowance system via<lb/> agreement of conversion factors.<lb/> The flexibility of a pledge-based system<lb/> means that countries can develop policy<lb/> tools involving emissions units – such as<lb/> domestic trading scheme – to achieve<lb/> pledges that suit each country&apos;s situation,<lb/> without having to ensure that domestic<lb/> allowances are backed up by international<lb/> allowance units. Nevertheless, to benefit<lb/> from international trading of these units by<lb/> linking schemes, some level of international<lb/> transparency and comparison would be<lb/> required.<lb/></p>

			<head>Use of offset<lb/> and credit<lb/> mechanisms<lb/></head>

			<p>An allowance unit system is suited to a small<lb/> number of centrally-organised offset<lb/> mechanisms, such as used under the KP. A<lb/> continued KP or partial KP would therefore<lb/> be most suited to continuation of existing<lb/> mechanisms plus new UN-organised<lb/> crediting systems. Experience with the<lb/> Kyoto mechanisms to date has shown that,<lb/> although providing good assurance of<lb/> environmental integrity, the scope of<lb/> mitigation has been restrained by complex<lb/> procedures. For countries not participating in<lb/> the allowance system, new country-<lb/>organised<lb/> bilateral<lb/> or<lb/> multilateral<lb/> mechanisms could be feasible under this<lb/> model with some level of UN oversight or<lb/> guidance to ensure minimum standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>The effectiveness of offsets in a pledge and<lb/> review system will depend on the level of<lb/> standardisation between offsets and the<lb/> ability to effectively track transactions. A<lb/> fully decentralised system would involve<lb/> each country or region establishing its own<lb/> rules for receiving offsets from other<lb/> countries. The flexibility to develop country<lb/> specific<lb/> mechanisms<lb/> could<lb/> increase<lb/> innovation in mitigation projects and<lb/> learning between different systems. While<lb/> existence of various unit mechanisms may<lb/> put an additional burden on investors and<lb/> developers, it would generate additional<lb/> investment opportunity in areas which the<lb/> existing systems do not cover. In addition,<lb/> the CDM could continue to operate, with<lb/> other mechanisms operating alongside it.<lb/></p>

			<head>42<lb/> 6. Exploring the &apos;middle ground&apos; option<lb/></head>

			<p>International negotiations are not yet conclusive on the framework for emissions accounting after<lb/> 2012. The future system is however likely to combine elements of the two models put forward in<lb/> Section 5. This section examines some elements that may form the basis of an accounting system that<lb/> falls in the middle ground between these two models.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1 The nature of the &apos;middle ground&apos;<lb/></head>

			<figure>Figure 4 in section 3 highlighted the range of potential options for the accounting framework,<lb/> indicating that the two models elaborated in Section 5 are towards the edges of the range of what is<lb/> likely to be feasible. Figure 9 below expands this figure to include more detail on how each building<lb/> block could vary across the spectrum.<lb/> Figure 9 : Attributes of the middle ground option<lb/></figure>

			<p>&apos;Pledge-and-<lb/>review&apos;<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1.1 Demonstrating progress towards objectives<lb/></head>

			<p>International demonstration of progress towards mitigation objectives depends on shared<lb/> understanding of the content and ambition of pledges, and for this reason the &apos;pledge-and-review&apos;<lb/> model proposed above already assumed that objectives are agreed based on a degree of common<lb/> accounting rules. This is a complex area and there is significant scope for rules to be standardised to<lb/> varying degrees for different sectors and gases (<ref type="biblio">Levin et al, 2010</ref>). Comparison and agreement of<lb/> country pledges is a political issue and is not the focus of this paper; it is discussed here only for its<lb/> relevance to unit accounting.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Most Annex I countries have submitted quantified emissions reduction targets for 2020 as a<lb/> percentage reduction from a certain base year. To convert this into an absolute quantity of emissions<lb/> for a certain year is not a simple process. There has been extensive debate over the complications of<lb/> comparing stated national mitigation pledges for the 2012-2020 period (Levin and Bradley, 2010;<lb/> Project Catalyst, 2010).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The concept of assigned amounts in the Kyoto Protocol provides a means to rationalise the percentage<lb/> reduction pledges made by Parties, in addition to providing the basis of a tradable GHG allowance<lb/> unit. This rationalisation hides many complications in the calculation of base year emissions.<lb/> Accounting rules are particularly complex in the area of land use, land use change and forestry<lb/> (LULUCF), and this highlights the very political nature of defining an emissions allowance total<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Baker et al, 2010</ref>). In addition to being described in terms of percentage reductions from base years,<lb/> most targets submitted by Annex I countries for the post-2012 era do not specify the LULUCF<lb/> accounting rules that are to be used.<lb/></p>

			<p>The middle ground option described here would not involve a Kyoto-style common allowance unit.<lb/> The resultant need for comparable reporting of absolute percentage emissions reductions goals may<lb/> mean that procedure for accounting rules could be borrowed from the Kyoto Protocol. For example,<lb/> the Kyoto Protocol already allows some flexibility for activities that countries can choose to include<lb/> in the baseline under specific conditions 23 . The use of such opt-in clauses could help to encourage<lb/> increased participation of a wider group of countries under a middle ground scenario, whilst<lb/> maintaining a level of international co-ordination of accounting rules. The current work of the Ad-<lb/>hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-<lb/>KP) on clarifying LULUCF rules for a possible second commitment period could therefore be useful<lb/> for that purpose, even in the absence of a new commitment period.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1.2 Role of UNFCCC bodies in GHG unit management after 2012<lb/></head>

			<p>Under this middle ground option, the UNFCCC and its Secretariat could be mandated by the Parties to<lb/> play an important yet markedly different role from the existing system. The UNFCCC Secretariat<lb/> currently fulfils a number of functions relevant to GHG unit management, including:<lb/>  Receiver of national inventory reports and national communications and co-ordination of<lb/></p>

			<figure>Expert Review Teams (ERTs)<lb/>  Approver of subsequent issuance through the ITL of AAUs for Kyoto Protocol countries<lb/>  Administrator of the ITL<lb/>  Administrator of the CDM, including overseeing issuance of CERs (via the CDM Executive<lb/> Board mandated by the Kyoto Parties under the CMP)<lb/>  Approving countries to issue Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) for Track 2 JI projects<lb/> through the work of the JI Supervisory Committee.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the hybrid model discussed here, the UNFCCC bodies could still have a vital role to play in a<lb/> number of these aspects. This could include: a continued role in co-ordination of reviews of Annex I<lb/> national communications and international consultations and analysis (ICA) of non-Annex I biennial<lb/> reports (including Biennial Reports (BR)); a continuation of some aspects of the ITL; and a level of<lb/> oversight in new, less centralised market mechanisms. These elements are summarised in <ref type="figure">figure 10</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>For co-ordinating national reporting, the role of the UNFCCC Secretariat in co-ordinating this<lb/> reporting and organising review teams where appropriate is likely to remain broadly the same in light<lb/> of the Cancún Agreements. The UNFCCC role in governing market mechanisms and tracking<lb/> transactions is discussed in sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 respectively.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1.3 Governance of international market mechanisms<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to continuing its role as the key CDM regulator (for those sectors in which CDM would<lb/> continue to operate), the UNFCCC could be instructed by the COP to maintain a level of oversight of<lb/> new mechanisms, even if the units generated by these mechanisms are not regulated and issued by the<lb/> UNFCCC. For example, the Secretariat could be mandated by the COP to develop international offset<lb/> protocols, or minimum standards to act as a resource that countries are encouraged to use when<lb/> introducing bilateral agreements on offsets. This could either build on CDM documents or involve<lb/> working with individual countries to meet specific requirements in those countries. Either way, it is a<lb/> very different role to the regulatory responsibility of the CDM Executive Board, with sole authority<lb/> for issuance of credits.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bilateral or multilateral offset mechanisms not directly regulated by the UN – whether established due<lb/> to a lack of internationally-agreed mechanisms or in parallel with UN-operated mechanisms – may<lb/> lead to an increased number of unit types, as discussed in section 4. To facilitate international<lb/> exchange of these units and their use to meet national or sub-national mitigation goals, a robust<lb/> assessment protocol could be developed for international recognition of offset units. The financial<lb/> value that is generated by the unit could then vary based on the buyer confidence of how closely that<lb/> particular unit adheres to the international standard. This would raise a number of issues that are<lb/> political as well as technical, for example concerning the ambition of the crediting baseline used for<lb/> particular sectors or countries. However, such a system may allow countries to benefit from the<lb/> flexibility of exploring new, nationally relevant market mechanisms, whilst maintaining a level of<lb/> international environmental integrity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Private sector actors play a critical role in the current CDM market, both as project developers,<lb/> brokers and purchasers. With the desire to scale-up financial flows for developing country mitigation,<lb/> including from the private sector, the impact of unit diversification on investor confidence should be<lb/> considered. Agreed international offset standards would create significant advantages for investors<lb/> over a fully fragmented approach, including:<lb/>  A larger, more liquid international market to purchase the units;<lb/>  Much greater simplicity for investors due to standardised rules, lowering barriers to entry for<lb/> potential project investors;<lb/>  Potentially greater political certainty around crediting duration.<lb/> While it could be argued that private sector financial institutions would thrive in a world of<lb/> fragmented trading systems, as they would be well placed to provide the arbitrage services needed to<lb/> connect and compare various systems, market commentators indicate that such advantages would be<lb/> outweighed by the high barriers to entry posed by a proliferation of schemes. A stable, simple,<lb/> common international framework for offsets would be desirable to significantly accelerate private<lb/> sector investment 24 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The UNFCCC may therefore be well-placed to take on a guidance-setting role for offset standards. It<lb/> is useful here to draw on the analogy of the existing JI system. Although countries which have met the<lb/> requirements to operate Track 1 JI have no need to follow UN-administrated procedures, many of<lb/> those countries have voluntarily used a close parallel to the UN-managed Track 2 process 25 . This is<lb/> presumably because if comprehensive, relevant and legal documentation and procedures already exist,<lb/> there is little point in each country committing its own resources to recreate such a system. There is a<lb/> difference between being mandated to use a certain procedure in order to receive credits, such as with<lb/> the development and issuance of CDM projects, and having the option of developing a unilateral<lb/> sovereign procedure, but nevertheless choosing to use a centralised system. In the post-2012 climate<lb/> negotiations, this seemingly subtle distinction could be important for finding politically-acceptable<lb/> ways to maintain offset standards.<lb/> For the UNFCCC to play this role, important issues to clarify include what, if any, minimum<lb/> standards for defining offsets are needed, how they can be agreed outside the framework of<lb/> international allowance units and also what elements such standards should cover. For the first<lb/> question, the extent to which the experience gained with CDM methodologies and standards would be<lb/> recognised could play an important part. In terms of what elements would be included, key proposals<lb/> would be methods for setting a baseline and the monitoring, reporting and verification procedures.<lb/> These are all elements that are linked to the environmental credibility of offsets and credits, and are<lb/> aspects that would be scrutinised by the international community when assessing new offset and<lb/> crediting mechanisms being put forward. Again CDM experience may be valuable.<lb/> Possible new market mechanisms such as sectoral crediting mechanisms or NAMA crediting involve<lb/> agreeing on the environmental ambition of the baseline. This would pose additional challenges in<lb/> terms of minimum requirements for international recognition of such credits as the baseline level<lb/> would be not only a technical question but also a political one subject to negotiations. Bilateral REDD<lb/> or REDD+ offsets, should they be developed, may require special attention given the potential scale<lb/> of such offsets and that there is limited experience due to the current ineligibility of REDD in CDM.<lb/> REDD offsets also involve particular challenges in terms of monitoring of leakage and permanence of<lb/> forests which point to a need for a special focus on the standards and tracking of such offsets and<lb/> maintenance of environmental safeguards. The UNFCCC and associated bodies could continue to<lb/> play a role in developing such aspects of international standards for bilateral mechanisms. For<lb/> example, the Cancún decisions lay out expected safeguards for REDD projects and further request the<lb/> Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological advice (SBSTA) to develop modalities for MRV of<lb/> REDD+ activities (UNFCCC, 2010a).<lb/> Another option for developing and maintaining international offset standards would be to have the<lb/> UNFCCC keep an international database of offsets generated based on international standards agreed<lb/> elsewhere. Other organisations like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) could be<lb/> responsible for developing and reaching agreement on international standards; the Alberta emissions<lb/> trading scheme in Canada uses ISO measurement standards for offsets. However, this could be limited<lb/> to only certain aspects of offset standards; concepts such as baseline setting and additionality may be<lb/> difficult to define under ISO. Furthermore, there may be financial challenges due to ISO charging<lb/> arrangements which may be seen as disadvantageous for allowing equal access to project<lb/> mechanisms.<lb/> In relating these possible roles to the international negotiations, it may be useful to look at the<lb/> differences in how international emissions trading and CDM were included in the Kyoto Protocol and<lb/> later developed. The text included in the Kyoto Protocol on both emissions trading (Article 17) and<lb/> CDM (Article 12) was rather basic. For CDM, however, a much more detailed framework, including<lb/> on MRV, was later established internationally through the Marrakesh Accords. In the case of<lb/> international emissions trading, on the other hand, guiding rules were developed directly by EU<lb/> countries in the process of transferring AAUs in the form of EUAs to industrial entities for intra-EU<lb/> trading. These two different approaches could both be applicable in trying to outline the post-2012<lb/> framework for offset and crediting mechanisms. Should international agreement on comprehensive<lb/> rules and modalities for new market mechanisms or the continuation of existing ones prove difficult,<lb/> an elementary agreement on guiding principles for developing international standards and defining<lb/> institutions responsible could be an important first step (<ref type="biblio">Aasrud et al, 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1.4 Tracking international unit transactions<lb/></head>

			<p>In the pledge-and-review world proposed above, the ITL would be replaced by an independent<lb/> tracking system based on reporting from linked registries. As part of a middle ground option, the ITL<lb/> could be developed to continue to serve this function outside of a Kyoto Protocol commitment period.<lb/> In this situation the existing pre-approval validation role of the ITL would no longer be needed.<lb/> However the transaction recording function could continue to operate under the auspices of the<lb/> UNFCCC.<lb/></p>

			<p>The functionality of the ITL may need to be broadened in this case to handle an increased number of<lb/> unit types and connections to new unit registries in countries that do not currently host Kyoto unit<lb/> registries (both Annex I and non Annex I). As well as continuing to track transactions of existing UN-<lb/>managed offsets such as CERs, new unit types could involve domestic units from sub-national<lb/> schemes – both allowances and offsets – that, although generated, issued and regulated under the<lb/> authority of a national government, could be tracked by the ITL.<lb/> A schematic of these options is shown in figure 12.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2 Potential lessons from outside of the Kyoto system<lb/> 6.2.1 Tracking transactions in international financial markets<lb/></head>

			<p>The tracking of GHG units in a non-Kyoto system could bear some resemblance to the regulation of<lb/> international financial markets. In financial markets, there is no UNFCCC equivalent, no central ITL-<lb/>type central gateway to verify and approve all international transactions. Nevertheless, some<lb/> mechanisms and processes have been put in place to assure that international transactions are both<lb/> possible – through common software and reporting formats – and traceable.<lb/> A specific example is the reporting of financial transactions as imposed by the Markets in Financial<lb/> Instruments Directive (MiFID) in the European Union (directive 2004/39/CE). MiFID has widespread<lb/> implications for the behaviour of firms operating in member states, but of interest here is the<lb/> requirement that competent authorities enforce mandatory reporting of financial transactions in a<lb/> common format. Furthermore, MiFID requires the competent authorities to exchange information<lb/> with their counterparts in different member states, in order to improve traceability and transparency of<lb/> transactions across the EU. This communication is facilitated by the Transaction Reporting Exchange<lb/> Mechanism (TREM) of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), which provides a<lb/> standard specification for communication and means that each national supervisory authority can<lb/> access to data on all transactions carried out in their domestic market by foreign market participants.<lb/> A different example is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT)<lb/> network for interbank financial movements. SWIFT provides a secure messaging service and a<lb/> common language for the transmission of financial information. It does not handle or transfer funds,<lb/> but provides the platform for common communication. Although it does not regularly store or log the<lb/> data it transmits, the model demonstrates the feasibility of voluntary international communication<lb/> standards that, though voluntary, become highly prevalent due to the utility that they provide for<lb/> international communication.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2.2 Lessons from aggregation in the voluntary carbon market<lb/></head>

			<p>The voluntary carbon market provides a useful model for how transactions of disparate units in a<lb/> fragmented policy structure could be gradually standardised and monitored in a non-Kyoto world. As<lb/> described in section 2.2, the term &apos;voluntary carbon market&apos; comprises a large number of different<lb/> voluntary carbon offset standards, different certification, issuance and registry systems and a large<lb/> number of diverse organisation types amongst buyers, all operating without centralised UN or<lb/> government-level oversight or control (<ref type="biblio">Guigon, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Nevertheless, the voluntary market is notable in several ways. Firstly it has developed into a<lb/> substantial international market; in 2008 market volume was estimated at 126.6 MtCO 2 e, though this<lb/> has since declined for a number of reasons (<ref type="biblio">Ecosystem Marketplace, 2010</ref>). This market volume<lb/> demonstrates confidence of market participants in the delivery of products through reliable registry<lb/> systems. The voluntary market is also notable for the wide range of standards and therefore varying<lb/> quality of offsets, and a corresponding wide range of prices per tonne. More than half of the volume is<lb/> conducted &apos;over the counter&apos; which implies that delivery of credits and technical operation by<lb/> registries and intermediaries is reliable.<lb/></p>

			<p>The large number of standards and their inherent complexity has led to progressive market<lb/> aggregation by which some private sector registry operators now offer aggregated registries that can<lb/> &apos;list&apos; more than one VER type and therefore offer buyers a one-stop-shop for supply of different<lb/> carbon standards. Some voluntary carbon standards have outsourced the full credit cycle to registry<lb/> companies, whereas others have retained in-house control over the issuance registry, but still allow<lb/> the units to be listed and sold through the aggregated registry. This model for accounting for multiple<lb/> unit types within a functional registry held independently of governments or the UNFCCC could<lb/> provide a useful example for dealing with multiple units in a less centralised system.<lb/> However, the voluntary market also highlights some of the dangers of a complex unit system with no<lb/> central tracking system and no standard compliance requirement. There is no guarantee of<lb/> transparency and information on market volumes and prices is gathered through voluntary interviews<lb/> with market participants (<ref type="biblio">Ecosystem Marketplace, 2010</ref>); although the EU ETS also has no<lb/> mandatory price disclosure, the standardised nature of EUAs as legal compliance units leads to a<lb/> uniform price. The large price differences in the voluntary market suggest widely differing levels of<lb/> offset quality and environmental integrity, though it could be argued that this price discovery is itself<lb/> a degree of visibility of offset quality. There is no means in such a diverse market to fully track how<lb/> many units have been created and where they have been consumed. Whilst this is not required for a<lb/> market servicing voluntary participants, it would not suffice for a system used for meeting legal<lb/> mitigation objectives. This lack of transparency further highlights the need for comprehensive<lb/> tracking in international GHG accounting.<lb/></p>

			<head>7. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>Market mechanisms are likely to continue to play a role in international climate policy in the future,<lb/> helping countries to meet climate change mitigation objectives through cost effective international co-<lb/>operation. Internationally-recognisable tradable units will therefore be required and this paper<lb/> explores the implications of different post-2012 frameworks on GHG accounting and transfer of units<lb/> between systems and countries. International emissions trading over as wide a geographic and<lb/> sectoral range as possible would ensure the pursuit of cost-effective means to achieve necessary<lb/> emissions abatement after 2012. Further, in order to promote environmental integrity, systems for<lb/> tracking and accounting for exchange of GHG units must be as robust and transparent as possible.<lb/></p>

			<p>Any post-2012 GHG accounting framework is likely to be more complex than the existing system, as<lb/> there will be a larger number of GHG unit &quot; currencies &quot; in circulation. This framework will need to<lb/> accommodate the quantified mitigation goals that have been proposed and adopted by some non-<lb/>Annex I countries and be able to interact with new GHG unit types that may be introduced both under<lb/> the UN and directly between Parties, such as bilaterally-agreed offset projects. The country grouping<lb/> proposed in this paper maintains the distinction between Annex I and non-Annex I countries, on the<lb/> assumption that only Annex I countries may accept internationally binding national emissions<lb/> reduction targets. Non-Annex I countries are split into two groups, distinguished as those with<lb/> quantified mitigation goals, and those without.<lb/> A range of options for international regulatory oversight and GHG unit accounting after 2012 is<lb/> possible, ranging from a continued Kyoto Protocol system to a completely decentralised approach<lb/> with little international coordination. However, these extremes are unlikely to be viable and the<lb/> completely decentralised approach in particular is undesirable because it would bring into question<lb/> comparison of mitigation efforts and raise questions about the environmental and economic integrity<lb/> of carbon markets themselves. To allow for tracking of emissions reductions with high integrity, the<lb/> system needs to:<lb/>  Be politically acceptable for all Parties;<lb/></p>

			<p> Allow for an effective and timely transition from the current system;<lb/></p>

			<p> Allow countries to clearly and easily demonstrate achievement of goals and targets;<lb/>  Allow Parties to develop their own domestic or regional emissions reduction instruments that<lb/> could be backed up by or interact with the international system;<lb/>  Allow for multiple unit types to be regulated, issued and tracked in a way that is transparent<lb/> and retains clear environmental integrity;<lb/>  Be flexible to accommodate specific needs of individual Parties and to be able to account for<lb/> future mitigation goals of non-Annex I countries should that become appropriate;<lb/></p>

			<figure>The paper elaborates two options for GHG accounting -a partial Kyoto Protocol system and a<lb/> country-led pledge-and-review system with common accounting rules – and concludes that the<lb/> most likely viable option may be the &apos;middle ground&apos; containing elements of both of these<lb/> models (summarised in figure 13).<lb/> Figure 13: Summary of post-2012 accounting options<lb/> Decreasing centralisation of accounting framework<lb/> Kyoto<lb/> Protocol 2 nd<lb/> CP (all<lb/> Annex I)<lb/> Fully<lb/> fragmented<lb/> Kyoto<lb/> Protocol 2 nd<lb/> CP (some<lb/> Annex I)<lb/> Middle<lb/> ground<lb/> Top down<lb/> Bottom up<lb/> &apos;Pledge-and-<lb/>review&apos;<lb/> A scenario involving a Kyoto Protocol commitment period for a limited number of Annex I<lb/> Parties would provide for a smooth transition from the current system because it would be a simple<lb/> extension of the Protocol&apos;s commitment period.</figure>

			<p>The existing processes for allocation of allowance<lb/> units could be continued and the ITL could continue to operate to keep track of all international unit<lb/> transactions relevant to international accounting for both existing and new UN-managed market<lb/> mechanisms. The UN would maintain control over existing offset mechanisms and could be mandated<lb/> to develop new mechanisms such as sector crediting with ambitious baselines in certain sectors in key<lb/> Non-Annex I countries. Maintaining the UN as sole regulator of these mechanisms could allow for a<lb/> strong guarantee of environmental integrity and, therefore, clearer indication of mitigation<lb/> achievements.<lb/> However, such a system is relatively rigid and inflexible to country requirements, meaning that some<lb/> Annex I countries would be likely to not participate in the allowance unit system. Assuming such<lb/> countries retain responsibility to report on progress towards implementation of goals, the process of<lb/> demonstrating achievement of pledges may become split, with a confusing mixture of some countries<lb/> using a Kyoto-style reporting of units holdings, whereas non-participating countries would not.<lb/> Furthermore, a system based on allowance units may prove to be inflexible to recognising mitigation<lb/> commitments from non-Annex I countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>A</head>

			<table>scenario based on pledge-and-review without a common allowance unit would allow countries<lb/> more flexibility to develop their own strategies for meeting their pledges, specific to individual needs.<lb/> The bilateral nature of developing offset standards potentially allows for more innovation and<lb/> dynamism in the use of mechanisms to stimulate increased emissions reduction activity. This model<lb/> would be more flexible to individual requirements of Annex I countries so would probably not suffer<lb/> from the heterogeneous nature of a Kyoto system where some Annex I Parties choose not to<lb/> participate.<lb/></table>

			<p>Under this model, countries would be responsible for implementing and operating offset and crediting<lb/> systems on a bilateral basis. Annex I countries would need to demonstrate achievement of pledges<lb/> through inventory reporting with supplementary information on unit holdings, which would require a<lb/> high level of transparency of unit transactions even in the absence of a centrally-administered UN<lb/> transaction log. The environmental integrity of this system would be dependent on both a shared<lb/> understanding of the scope and content of national pledges, and the tracking system for identifying the<lb/> nature and volume of emissions unit transactions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>A &apos;middle ground&apos; option, containing elements of both of these models, may prove to be the<lb/> likely outcome for a reliable system for GHG accounting. Some suggested building blocks for this<lb/> model are that:<lb/></figure>

			<p> Common accounting rules would be agreed to ensure common understanding of the content<lb/> and scope of pledges, in order to provide a stable platform for international use of offset units.<lb/> Experience from the Kyoto Protocol, for example in LULUCF accounting, could inform this<lb/> process and allow flexibility to encourage participation of a wider group of countries;<lb/>  No single common international allowance unit would be used, but that allowance units from<lb/> domestic or regional trading schemes may be tracked internationally in some cases;<lb/>  That the UNFCCC Secretariat would be mandated by the Parties to play an important role in<lb/> international GHG unit accounting, albeit markedly different from its current role. This could<lb/> involve defining offset standards or principles for countries to adopt when defining bilateral<lb/> offset agreements<lb/>  That the ITL may continue to operate as a UN-managed system to track transactions, without<lb/> continuing its Kyoto Protocol role as a verifier of all unit transactions;<lb/>  That CDM would continue to operate, but may not be pursued in certain sectors in some<lb/> countries depending on the conditions of mitigation goals put forward by non-Annex I<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Under this &apos;middle ground&apos; system, the UNFCCC institutions could retain important oversight<lb/> functions.</figure>

			<p>The CDM approval and issuance process would likely continue, albeit restricted to certain<lb/> sectors and countries. The UNFCCC could also develop an important function as a standard-setting<lb/> body for international offset standards that countries would be encouraged to adopt for their own<lb/> offset mechanisms. In this way countries could choose whether to use the standard, but experience<lb/> with Joint Implementation has shown that if UN procedures are available, it may be in countries&apos;<lb/> interest to use them rather than develop their own system from scratch. For the UNFCCC to play this<lb/> role would maintain the possibility of returning to an allowance-based system in the future.<lb/></p>

			<p>In such a system, the eligibility of which offset units can be used to meet mitigation objectives in<lb/> developed countries, as well as whether they can also count towards meeting the host developing<lb/> country&apos;s emissions goals (including CDM) are essentially matters for political negotiation and<lb/> interpretation. However, the ability to track all movements of units is crucial, to ensure that no single<lb/> emission reduction is credited under more than one offset standard, that no double counting of<lb/> emissions reductions between countries and to maintain transparency over the generation and use of<lb/> offsets. The quality or environmental standard of the units themselves is linked inherently to the<lb/> scope, content and ambition of country pledges, and is not the concern of this paper. The quality of<lb/> 51<lb/> units may vary over time through negotiation, but the ability to track transactions is crucial from the<lb/> outset.<lb/> Recent developments in the voluntary carbon market, in particular registry aggregation to allow<lb/> multiple unit types to be listed and traded through the same registry, might provide useful elements of<lb/> how increasingly complex unit systems could maintain traceability without UN control. Examples<lb/> from the financial sector of transaction tracking and data sharing could provide useful precedence.<lb/> However, safeguards must be put in place to ensure that such a system is not less transparent than the<lb/> automatic tracking and pre-approval of transactions through the ITL under Kyoto.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, this paper highlights a number of unit accounting issues relevant to the ongoing<lb/> UNFCCC negotiations. The paper considers elements of what would constitute a functional unit<lb/> accounting framework, and further work will explore some of these issues in more detail.<lb/></p>

			<head>ANNEX: Background on GHG accounting in the UNFCCC, Kyoto<lb/> Protocol, EU ETS and others<lb/> Accounting for national emissions under the UNFCCC<lb/></head>

			<p>All UNFCCC Parties are required to submit national communications to the UNFCCC; the frequency<lb/> and content of the reports varies significantly between Annex I and Non-Annex I Parties. A detailed<lb/> analysis of the current and potential future reporting framework has been carried out in <ref type="biblio">Ellis, et al<lb/> (2010)</ref>. In brief, Annex I Parties currently submit national communications every 3-5 years and<lb/> annual national inventory reports of anthropogenic emissions. For non-Annex I Parties there is no<lb/> specified submission timetable after the initial national communication and they are not currently<lb/> required to provide national inventory reports or projections of future emissions, although some have<lb/> included elements of both topics in their most recent national communications.<lb/> The Cancún Agreements introduced biennial reports for all countries (which, for developing<lb/> countries, are to include national inventory reports) and specified that non-Annex I Parties should<lb/> submit national communications every four years (subject to the provision of finance and with<lb/> additional flexibility for least developed countries and small island developing states).<lb/></p>

			<head>Kyoto Protocol accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>Annex I national inventory reports also provide the backbone for establishing compliance of Annex I<lb/> countries under their Kyoto Protocol commitments, combined with information provided on use of<lb/> emissions units under the flexibility mechanisms, as described below.<lb/> Parties with a commitment under Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol can submit a single inventory report<lb/> to serve for both the Convention and the Protocol. Furthermore, Annex B Parties are required to<lb/> demonstrate that they have national systems in place for reliable reporting of emissions estimation, as<lb/> well as processes for improving estimations where necessary (under Article 5 of the KP).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Much of the detail for the accounting for and transfer of units under the Kyoto Protocol is contained<lb/> in decisions adopted at CMP 1 in Montreal in 2005 (UNFCCC 2005).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In addition to the national inventory report and information on emissions units, the Kyoto Protocol<lb/> specifies that Annex B Parties shall submit supplementary information detailing how they are striving<lb/> to meet their commitments in a way that minimises adverse social, environmental and economic<lb/> impacts, including impacts on developing countries. Annex B Parties shall also provide information<lb/> on how each Party&apos;s use of the flexibility mechanisms is supplemental to domestic action and on how<lb/> their policies and measures implemented, including in collaboration with other Parties, to achieve<lb/> Kyoto Protocol obligations. Parties must also demonstrate steps they have taken to implement any<lb/> decisions or recommendations on bunker fuel emissions management adopted by IMO or ICAO,<lb/> should any be relevant; to date, only emissions from domestic aviation are included in the inventory.<lb/> All other aviation and maritime emissions are not currently counted towards national emissions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Issuance of Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) and Removal Units (RMUs)<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the Kyoto Protocol, the National Inventory Report is used to calculate the annual level of<lb/> emissions for which a Party must submit allowance units and offset credits at the end of a<lb/> Commitment Period. This Assigned Amount is based on the Party&apos;s emissions commitment under<lb/> Kyoto and their pre-established emissions inventory from a base year (usually 1990), multiplied by<lb/> the number of years in the Commitment Period (five for the first period).<lb/> Once a Party&apos;s assigned amount has been reviewed by an expert review team, the Party may issue an<lb/> equivalent quantity of</p>

			<table>AAUs into its national registry (registries are described below). The AAU is<lb/> the core currency of the Kyoto Protocol and allows for the exchange of emissions units via the Kyoto<lb/> Flexibility Mechanisms. Each AAU is given a serial number comprising CP number, Party identifier,<lb/> The Party may also issue RMUs into its national registry to account for net removals of anthropogenic<lb/> emissions sequestered by changes in forestry and land-use since 1990. The rules for this are complex<lb/> and stem from paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the KP, which describe how Parties may decide to<lb/> account for direct human-induced land-use change in both forestry (paragraph 3) and other land-use<lb/> (paragraph 4). Each Party decides in advance whether to issue RMUs annually during the<lb/> commitment period or once at the start of the period. RMUs also have a serial number which also<lb/> includes a reference to the type of activity to which the RMU relates. RMUs issued cannot total more<lb/> than 1% of annual base year emissions (for the first CP).<lb/> Transfer of units under the Flexibility Mechanisms<lb/> The Kyoto Protocol allows for exchange of emissions units between Parties under three flexibility<lb/> mechanisms:<lb/> -International Emissions Trading (IET), comprising direct exchange of AAUs between national<lb/> registries;<lb/> -Joint Implementation (JI), exchange of Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) arising from<lb/> specific project-based emissions reductions within a Kyoto Annex B country; ERUs are<lb/> converted from existing AAUs so do not lead to any increase in allowance units within the<lb/> international system;<lb/> -Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), import of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)<lb/> from specific project-based actions in Kyoto Parties that are not in Annex I; CERs are created<lb/> in addition to existing AAUs so represent an increase of allowance units in the international<lb/> system.<lb/> To be eligible to transfer units under the mechanisms, Parties must fulfil certain requirements (as<lb/> listed in Decision 11/CMP1). Each Party must ensure that it:-<lb/>-is a Party to the KP;<lb/> -has calculated and recorded an Assigned Amount;<lb/> -has in place national systems for emissions estimation, according to Art 5 paragraph 1 of KP;<lb/> -has a national registry as described below;<lb/> -has submitted its most recent required inventory, with quality assessment carried out on those<lb/> gases and sectors specified in Annex A of the KP; and<lb/> -submits all necessary additional information on assigned amounts required to calculate<lb/> additions and subtractions from the assigned amount (Article 3, mostly concerning LULUCF<lb/> emissions).<lb/> Transfers between national registries are under the responsibility of both Parties (13/CMP1). If a Party<lb/> authorises other legal entities to transfer or acquire units, such as occurs under the European<lb/> Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) then the Party still remains responsible for fulfilling its KP<lb/> obligations.<lb/></table>

			<p>Each Party with an emissions commitment must at all times retain a commitment period reserve of<lb/> emissions units, set at 90% of its Assigned Amount as or five times its most recent inventory total,<lb/> whichever is lower – i.e. if its emissions have dropped below 90% of its original Assigned Amount<lb/> total then it must have AAUs or other units equivalent to at least the recent emissions level.<lb/></p>

An expired lCER must be replaced<lb/> by another Kyoto unit. Project developers can choose lCERs or<lb/> tCERs as a means to reduce risk of non-permanence of forestry<lb/> projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Functioning of Kyoto registries and the International Transaction Log<lb/></head>

			<p>Each Party must establish a standardised electronic database known as a registry to ensure the<lb/> accurate accounting of the issuance, holding, transfer, acquisition, cancellation and retirement of<lb/> ERUs, CERs, AAUs and RMUs and the carry-over of ERUs, CERs and AAUs. Each Party designates<lb/> an organisation to administrate its registry and registries can be consolidated, provided that each<lb/> national account is distinct.<lb/> Each registry must hold a number of mandatory accounts:<lb/> -Holding accounts for the Party and for all entities authorised to hold units on its behalf;<lb/> -At least three cancellation accounts, one for actions concerning LULUCF, one for<lb/> inconsistencies and one for any other cancellations;<lb/> -A retirement account for compliance at the end of the Commitment Period.<lb/></p>

			<p>Registries are connected to each other via the International Transaction Log, hosted by the UNFCCC<lb/> Secretariat. The ITL acts to validate that transactions have not infringed Kyoto Protocol accounting<lb/> rules, as well as recording all transactions.<lb/> Transfers are initiated by Parties, or in the case of CDM issuance by the EB, who instruct their<lb/> registries to move units from one account to another either in the same registry or that of another<lb/> 55<lb/></p>

			<p>Party. For a transfer to another registry, the registry initiating the transfer creates a unique transaction<lb/> that identifies the transaction as well as the initiating Party and the CP for which the transfer will be<lb/> relevant to. A record of this is sent to the ITL which forwards it to the receiving registry. The ITL is<lb/> crucial to the exchange of units between registries and is operated with support from the UNFCCC<lb/> Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities. The ITL performs an automatic check on the validity of the<lb/> units, the eligibility of the registries and whether CERs from LULUCF are within the prescribed<lb/> limits.<lb/></p>

			<p>If no discrepancy is found, the two registries must notify the ITL and each other of the completion of<lb/> the transaction. The ITL makes this information publicly available.<lb/></p>

			<head>Compilation and accounting at the end of a Commitment Period<lb/></head>

			<p>At the end of the CP, Parties must transfer the correct quantity of mixed units to the retirement<lb/> account, and may carry-over any remaining units to the following commitment period up to certain<lb/> limits as follows: ERUs (up to 2.5% of assigned amount, provided they are not converted from<lb/> RMUs), CERs (up to 2.5%), AAUs (unlimited), but no RMUs may be carried over. Cancellations<lb/> must be made for alterations to LULUCF emissions subject to the outcome of a formal review<lb/> process. Voluntary cancellations can also be made by the Party or its authorised entities using the<lb/> cancellation accounts, but these cannot be used for retirement.<lb/> Once the additional time for fulfilling commitments is passed (the true-up period), the Secretariat will<lb/> launch a database to compile the emissions and the units held by Annex B Parties in order to assess<lb/> their compliance with the Kyoto Protocol obligations. This will be used to compare the total of AAUs,<lb/> ERUs, CERs and RMUs (issued by the Party itself) to the Party&apos;s reported GHG emissions from<lb/> relevant sources in Annex A.<lb/> Parties will then declare the number of units that it wishes to retire, and the number to carry-over,<lb/> according to the quantities held in its registry holding account. The database shall record which<lb/> Parties are eligible to use RMUs, CERs and ERUs and will establish the limits for each type of unit in<lb/> the database. The Secretariat will separately record the total annual emissions for each Party for each<lb/> year of the Commitment Period, taking into account amendments arising from the national inventory<lb/> review process.<lb/></p>

			<p>The database will also include annual totals for transactions completed by each Party, including<lb/> acquisitions, issuances, cancellations and retirements. The Secretariat compiles this information into<lb/> annual reports during the CP and also into a final report at the end of the additional period for<lb/> fulfilling commitments.<lb/></p>

			<head>Party reporting of emissions units<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to their requirements for emissions reporting through the Inventory Reports, Annex B<lb/> Parties must also report their use of emissions units annually using an electronic reporting format<lb/> known as the Standard Electronic Format (SEF) tables. The tables include all types of units held in the<lb/> Party&apos;s registry accounts, including information on tCERs and lCERs prior to their expiry and<lb/> required replacement. The tables are also used to record conversions of AAUs into ERUs for JI<lb/> projects (indicating ERUs as &apos;additions&apos; and AAUs as &apos;subtractions&apos;). The tables also require<lb/> significant detail on LULUCF and issuance of RMUs.<lb/></p>

			<head>The EU ETS and interface with the Kyoto Protocol system<lb/></head>

			<p>The EU ETS, as the flagship policy for EU Kyoto Parties to meet their international obligations, is<lb/> integrally linked to the international Kyoto accounting framework. Although it is a mandatory cap-<lb/>and-trade scheme using its own allowance unit as a trading currency, each European Allowance Unit<lb/></p>

			<table>(EUA) is currently directly converted from a Member State&apos;s stock of AAUs (until 2012). Therefore<lb/> trade of EUAs around Europe is in fact equivalent to trade of AAUs between private entities holding<lb/> registry accounts in European Party Kyoto Protocol registries, and each of these transactions is<lb/> verified by the ITL in the normal way. The Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which<lb/> was set up to handle EU ETS trades before the Kyoto first Commitment Period began (and in fact due<lb/> to delays in the launch of the ITL, continued to be the principal trading hub until late 2008) is still<lb/> operational and acts as a back-up system to the ITL, double-checking EU-specific transactions. The<lb/> European registry system was described in detail in the &apos;Registries Regulation&apos; agreed in 2004 and<lb/> modified in 2008 and 2010 (European Commission, 2010). The EU registry system is set to change<lb/> substantially on 1 January 2012, as described below.<lb/> Up to 2012, Parties participating in the EU ETS use their Kyoto Protocol registry for accounting for<lb/> EUA units. The Registries Regulation instructs each Member State, having had its National<lb/> Allocation Plan approved by the Commission and entered into the CITL, to convert the equivalent<lb/> number of AAUs in the Party holding account into EUAs by adding an identifier to the serial number<lb/> of the AAU. These EUAs are then transferred by the national administrator into operator holding<lb/> accounts held in the national registry for all relevant installations. EUAs can then be traded between<lb/> operators, with any transfer between accounts verified and recorded by both the CITL and (since<lb/> October 2008) the ITL.<lb/> Operators can of course comply with annual EU ETS obligations by surrendering either EUAs<lb/> equivalent to their verified emissions, or a mixture of EUAs and CERs/ERUs with the latter<lb/> constituting no more than a maximum proportion of emissions as stipulated by each Member State.<lb/> To demonstrate compliance, operators request the administrator of the national registry of where the<lb/> installation is located to transfer a specified number of allowances from the operator&apos;s holding<lb/> account to the Party holding account in the same registry. For CERs/ERUs, the operator can request<lb/> that a specified number of credits be transferred to the Party retirement account directly. Prior to<lb/> 2010, CERs could be transferred to the Party holding account in the registry. However, after it<lb/> emerged in March 2010 that some EU Member States were reselling such CERs to non-European<lb/> buyers</table>

			<p>, and that these &apos;used&apos; CERs were being sold back into the EU-ETS via brokers, the<lb/> Commission made amendments to the Registries Regulation to prevent this occurring. It is now<lb/> stipulated that when a CER is transferred from the commercial operator to the Member State, it must<lb/> pass directly into the retirement account in the Party registry, therefore being only eligible for use as<lb/> part of the national Party&apos;s Kyoto compliance strategy and not for re-export out of Europe.<lb/></p>

As only emissions from domestic aviation<lb/> emissions are covered by Kyoto commitments, the majority of allowances for aircraft operators&apos;<lb/> emissions in Europe cannot be linked to national Kyoto Protocol AAUs in the way that EUAs have<lb/> been to date. This means that EUAs issued to aircraft operators (known as Chapter II allowances after<lb/> their position in the revised ETS directive) must be kept distinct from regular EUAs for stationary<lb/> installations (Chapter III allowances). Whilst aviation operators can use both types of EUA for<lb/> compliance, regular stationary operators can ONLY use Type III allowances.<lb/></table>

			<p>To accommodate this change, EUAs will now be held in a central Union registry with accounts<lb/> nominated for each relevant Party and for each operator, individual and verifier active in the scheme.<lb/> Member States will continue to operate their own Kyoto Protocol registries to account for AAUs and<lb/> other Kyoto units, and the Union will also have its own KP registry for handling Kyoto units.<lb/> National Allocation Plans will now be held centrally by the EU Transaction Log (EUTL), the new<lb/> name for the CITL. Once the NAPs are finalised, Member States will be obliged to place a number of<lb/> AAUs equivalent to their total EU ETS allocation into a designated &quot; ETS AAU Deposit Account &quot;<lb/> held in the Member State KP registry. They will then issue the same quantity of EUAs into their<lb/> National Allowance Holding Account in the Union registry. In this way, although EUAs are no longer<lb/> directly converted from AAUs as they are before 2012, they are still in effect backed-up by the AAUs<lb/> placed into the deposit account. Once in the National Allowance Holding Account, the Member State<lb/> can then transfer allowances to installations via their operator holding accounts also in the Union<lb/> registry; these can also be delivered by auction for certain sectors from 2013. The aviation sector will<lb/> have its allocation plan held centrally in the Union account for the entire European sector. Once<lb/> finalised, each Member State will be responsible for issuing specific Chapter II allowances into<lb/> holding accounts for aircraft operators held in the Union registry. Operators and other entities are then<lb/> free to trade both types of allowances, as well as to purchase CERs via the CDM registry, with all<lb/> transactions being recorded in both the EUTL and the ITL.<lb/></p>

			<p>The need to keep aviation allowances distinct means that the compliance process is much more<lb/> complex than the existing system. For stationary operators, allowances are surrendered by requesting<lb/> that EUAs be transferred from the operator holding account into the Union Allowance Deletion<lb/> account, both within the Union registry. At the same time, if the operator wishes to use CERs or<lb/> ERUs for compliance then these are transferred from the operator holding account in the Union<lb/> registry to the Party&apos;s holding account in the Member State&apos;s own KP registry. For operators within<lb/> countries that have not made Kyoto Protocol commitments and therefore do not have KP registries –<lb/> currently Malta and Cyprus – the CERs or ERUs are instead transferred from the operator holding<lb/> account to the Union cancellation account in the Union&apos;s KP Registry (which is distinct from the main<lb/> Union registry for allowance trading). If aviation operators wish to use CERs or ERUs for<lb/> compliance, these units are transferred not to the KP registry of the Party, but instead to the Aviation<lb/> Set-Aside account in the Union registry.<lb/></p>

			<p>The fact that EUAs are no longer created directly by converting AAUs means that safeguards must be<lb/> put in place to ensure that the number of units in each Member State&apos;s AAU deposit account matches<lb/> the number of EUAs held by operators under its jurisdiction. This will be done by a clearing system<lb/> whereby on 1 June each year, after EU ETS operators have surrendered necessary allowances for the<lb/> year, any country that has operators still with EUAs in their accounts, should transfer the equivalent<lb/> number of AAUs from the Member State AAU deposit account into a central Union clearing account<lb/> in the Union registry. These allowances will then be transferred to the AAU Deposit Accounts of<lb/> countries whose operators have surrendered more allowances than were issued to them at the start of<lb/> the year.<lb/> Furthermore, if aviation operators have in part used Chapter III EUAs to meet their compliance<lb/> obligations, each Member State must transfer the equivalent number of AAUs from its holding<lb/> account into the Aviation Set-Aside account. This is to maintain the integrity of the system given that<lb/> most aviation emissions are not covered by Kyoto. The Set-Aside account is then used to transfer<lb/> AAUs BACK to member states to account for domestic aircraft operation emissions because these are<lb/> covered by the Kyoto Protocol. If there is a shortfall of AAUs in the set-aside account, CERs will<lb/> also be used for this purpose, and if there is still a shortfall then the overall quantity returned to<lb/> Member States will be reduced.<lb/> The complexity of this process highlights the difficulty of<lb/> maintaining a close link between a sub-national trading scheme and an international UN allowance<lb/> unit when the sectoral scope of the two is not the same.<lb/> 59<lb/></p>

			<head>Role of Project-based Mechanisms in GHG accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>Although superficially similar, the two Kyoto Protocol project mechanisms, CDM and JI, present very<lb/> different implications for GHG accounting.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both mechanisms require individual projects to calculate their impact on emissions levels against a<lb/> baseline that represents the emissions situation that would have occurred in the absence of the project.<lb/> Project proponents must also demonstrate that the project would not or could not have occurred<lb/> without revenue from the carbon credits earned.<lb/> Thereafter, the accounting procedures differ greatly. Each CDM project is overseen by a UN-<lb/>appointed Executive Board that approves the registration of the project. Once an approved project is<lb/> constructed and operating it can apply ex-post for issuance of CERs equal to its emissions reductions.<lb/> Should the CDM EB approve the application, the CERs are issued in a special CDM registry<lb/> &apos;pending&apos; account, prior to being transferred to the holding account of the project participant, who<lb/> will have a registry account hosted within one of the national Party registries. In this way the CDM<lb/> EB creates units that are supplemental to AAUs already in circulation, so its role is not unlike that of a<lb/> central bank creating money.<lb/> JI projects can either be managed entirely by the host country government (track 1), should the<lb/> government have UN approval to do so, or be overseen by another UN panel, the Joint<lb/> Implementation Supervisory Committee (JISC), track 2. The JISC functions in a similar fashion to the<lb/> EB, with the crucial difference that it does not itself issue carbon credits – it simply authorises host<lb/> country governments to do so. Once this authorisation is given (or, in Track 1, when the host country<lb/> is satisfied that the emissions reductions have been verified), the host country converts existing AAUs<lb/> 61<lb/> into ERUs according to the procedure described above. There is therefore no net increase in the<lb/> number of emissions allowance units circulating in the international system.<lb/></p>

			<p>These differences are particularly marked from the point of view of the host country. For JI, by<lb/> issuing ERUs to a project a host country is effectively reducing its available stock of AAUs, therefore<lb/> even though the project has acted to reduce host country emissions, the Party is no closer to meeting<lb/> its Kyoto commitment. Nevertheless, the emissions reduction will be reflected in the next National<lb/> Inventory Report. In CDM, the issuance of credits has no impact at all on the host country&apos;s emissions<lb/> accounting profile; non-Annex I countries are not required to compile a detailed national inventory<lb/> report. CDM therefore relies on its &apos;additionality&apos; test to ensure that global emissions have not in<lb/> effect increased due to the issuance of CERs that are supplemental to existing AAUs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-Kyoto Units<lb/></head>

			<p>As described in the main text there are a number of carbon credit and allowance units issued by<lb/> independent bodies that are outside the UNFCCC system. These include:<lb/> -voluntary verified emissions reductions (VERs) sold internationally and used generally for<lb/> voluntary offsetting of emissions by private sector bodies;<lb/> -voluntary or mandatory sub-national cap and trade schemes in countries that are not, or were<lb/> not until recently, Annex B Parties in the Kyoto Protocol.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are a number of certification standards for verifying and assuring the quality of VERs. The two<lb/> most important internationally are the Gold Standard and the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS), and<lb/> both have operational registry systems. The Gold Standard Registry is operated by the data company<lb/> APX and, although it is primarily designed to track the life cycle of individual Gold Standard VERs, it<lb/> also contains information on CERs that have been certified by the UN CDM EB but which also bear<lb/> the Gold Standard kite mark for quality. The VCS registry system is split between independent<lb/> operating companies, all connected to a central VCS project database, which allows for buyers to<lb/> choose which company to open an account with. Both Gold Standard VERs and Voluntary Carbon<lb/> Units (VCUs) are similar in format to CERs, in that they represent an emissions reduction of 1 tonne<lb/> of CO 2 equivalent with assurance that this reduction would not have occurred in the absence of the<lb/> project. In this way the project databases and registries are analogous to the CDM Registry and Party<lb/> Kyoto Protocol registries used under the UNFCCC.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the US, the Climate Action Registry, American Carbon Registry and CCX dominate the market.<lb/> CCX is no longer operating as an active market, but previously its basic unit was a Carbon Financial<lb/> Instrument (CFI), equivalent to 100tCO 2 , and contracts for CFIs could contain both allowances and<lb/> offsets. Participation in the scheme was voluntary but legally binding for those involved. Allowances<lb/> were allocated for free via a &apos;grandfathering&apos; procedure and an agreed emissions reduction trajectory.<lb/> Offsets were determined according to CCX-specific rules and could comprise both US and<lb/> international projects, though most have been US-based projects. The CCX ran its own registry to<lb/> oversee all trading of CFIs, and this was integrated with an electronic trading platform to allow<lb/> participants to trade in both allowances and offsets. All allowances and offsets are serialised to ensure<lb/> that units cannot be used twice or double-counted.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although non-Kyoto units do not affect current Kyoto Protocol accounting, such schemes could<lb/> become have a bearing on post-2012 international accounting in two ways, as discussed in the main<lb/> text. Tradable units from sub-national schemes may become an important tool for countries to meet<lb/> post-2012 mitigation objectives, and the voluntary market system may provide useful lessons for a<lb/> less centralised market after 2012.<lb/> 62<lb/></p>
