By bringing businesses into the formal economy, governments are able to provide more strategic and 
targeted policies for businesses and consumers. The objective of this working paper is to look at the 
importance of business registration for governments, businesses and citizens. It explores the this issue 
through a series of case studies that support good practices in customer orientation and joined-up 
government. Each of the different case studies fall under a pillar that aims to support countries in the 
development of their business registration systems. 
The paper also aims to provide policy directions for countries in Southeast Asia when developing 
modern business registration systems and provides some background for the development of ASEAN's 
regional business registration principles. JEL classification: D01, D21, D22, D73, H1, H32, L2, M13, N85, N80 Key Words: Business registration, business entry, Micro, Small and Medium Size Enterprises, one-

continue to start up and operate under sub-optimal conditions in economies around the world. Barriers 
associated with registration, 'Entry barriers', are one of the early constraints that aspiring entrepreneurs 
encounter while attempting to access the formal economy. Why would a business register? Registering a business provides it with formal protection of rights and removes the threat of penalties. 
It should make it easier to trade and grow, for instance by improving access to credit (banks will rarely 
lend to informal businesses) or government support. Business registration, oftentimes in the form of incorporation, gives the business the characteristics of 
a legal entity. It limits the liability of shareholders and reduces the transactions costs of organizing 
commercial activity by giving the business a legal persona, providing assurance that contracts are 
enforceable. The articles of association and any associated memorandum achieve this and establish limited 
liability for company agents or entrepreneurs who engage in contracts on behalf of the company or 
enterprise. These articles are filed in the registry and shield those acting on behalf of the company or 
enterprise from personal liability. Box 1. Registration reduces risk In modern trade, transactions can be complex, involving dozens of steps and suppliers. The more complex and 
the longer the time frame over which it occurs, the greater the risk. Registration can reduce that risk. For example, an importer of agricultural products in one country wishes to place an order with an exporter in 
another country, far away. Registration lets the importer find out that the company they are dealing with is in good 
standing and that the counterpart in the company with which they are dealing has the legal authority to commit to an 
export contract. Each firm compares its perceived costs of being formal—including the burden of initial registration 
and ongoing costs (e.g., tax payments, licensing, labour law)—with its perceived benefits of being formal 
(e.g., access to larger contracts, banks, courts and government contracts, potential growth in productivity 1 , 
reduced risk of fines and penalties). Businesses with larger efficient scales rationally register as they grow 
large enough to benefit from the formal institutions. The majority of microenterprises in most developing 
countries remain informal, despite more than a decade of reforms 2 aimed at making it easier and cheaper 
for them to formalize, because of the lack of intention or interest to grow. What, therefore, are the elements 
of business registration that can help motivate businesses to grow and why should this be important for 
governments? 1 The Demand for, and Consequences of Formalisation among informal Firms in Sri Lanka, Mel, McKenzie , Woodruff March 2012 AIZ DP

2 Entry Regulation and the Formalization of Microenterprises in Developing Countries Miriam Bruhn, David McKenzie World Bank Res Obs 
(2014) 29 (2): 186-201 and Informality revisited, World Development Volume 32, Issue 7, July 2004 8 Why governments want businesses to register? Government wants new businesses to be created for many reasons. The effect of new business 
formation is to increase economic growth 3 by fostering firm productivity 4 , increasing jobs 5 in the new and 
incumbent businesses, and raising profitability by reducing the transaction costs of doing business. The 
competition created lowers prices and drives innovation and technology adoption, creating a better range of 
products for consumers. Registration enables businesses to link into regional and global supply chains, 
with advantages of larger markets, access to finance and technology, and exposure to good business 
practice and skills. Good registration is also an important step in the broader promotion of an accountable, transparent, 
efficient, and predictable regulatory business operating environment, often implemented by different 
licensing and inspection authorities and tax and custom administrations. Informal employment is positively correlated with poverty and low-level of development. 60-80% of 
micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries are informal (IFC 2014). They are 
typically three-person enterprises or smaller (McKenzie and Bruhn 2013). For instance, 90% of informal 
firms in Sri Lanka are sole trader enterprises (De Mel et. al. 2013). In the 43 developing and transition 
economies for which ILO data is available on the share of the workforce in informal sector enterprises, the 
main job of a third (31%) of the non-agricultural workforce is in an informal sector enterprise 6 . In 
Cambodia in 2013, under half of agro-enterprises had any degree of formality 7 . Bringing businesses into the formal economy is an entry point for fair taxation, protection of 
employees, other business licensing and investor protection (e.g. disqualification of insolvent directors, 
share registration). Expanding the tax base allows government to pursue these and other policy objectives. 
Registration also provides valuable data for policy development. Conversely, excessively cumbersome regulation for start-ups is associated with higher levels of 
corruption and informality 8 . There is also some evidence that FDI crowds out domestic investment in 
countries with entry regulation cost above a certain level 9 . Making the business exit process more cost-
effective can also facilitate a more efficient allocation of capital and labour in different sectors. Job losses 
due to failing firms should be outweighed by jobs created.  Lower barriers to start-up are associated with a smaller informal sector.  Lower costs of entry encourage entrepreneurship, enhance firm productivity and reduce 
corruption. 
 Simple start-up translates into greater employment opportunities 3 Investigating the anatomy of the employment effect of new business formation

4 Informality has a negative impact on productivity, accounting for nearly 50 percent of the overall productivity gap between countries, such as 
Portugal, Turkey, and the United States (Farrell 2004). Using WBES, La Porta and Shleifer (2008) find that formal firms have 
substantially higher productivity levels than informal firms 
5 Ayyagari et. al. (2013) have demonstrated zero growth of employment of informal businesses over its life-cycle vis-à-vis a two-to four-fold 
increase of employment in the formal sector in India

9 Munemo, J. Rev World Econ (2014) 150: 745. doi:10.1007/s10290 -014-0189-2 9 Reforms to increase registration Starting up a business has usually involved 3 phases of interaction with regulatory requirements:  pre-registration – e.g. name check, prepare company statutes, deposit capital  registration – procedures at the registry and announcement  post-registration – e.g. acquiring company books and seal, registration with tax and labour 
authorities, other permits/licenses and related inspections Klapper and Love (2010) 10 find that a more than 40% reduction in procedures and 50% in costs and 
time are needed to have a significantly increase registrations. Other studies show that these can increase 
registration by up to 20%. Countries with weaker business environments require relatively larger reforms 
in order increase registration. Multiple reforms make more impact. It is beneficial to make entry regulation 
simple but it will not increase formal registration if tax rates or other regulations are onerous. 11 Box 2. . Increasing registration by entry regulation reform in Portugal In 2005 Portugal created its 'On the Spot Firm' programme (Empresa na Hora). These were One Stop Shops 
implementing simplified incorporation procedures (standard, pre-approved articles, pre-defined names and eliminated 
registration of company books and public deeds) with significantly reduced administrative fees. The time taken to register was reduced from several months to as little as 1 hour and the cost from EUR2000 to 
under EUR400. Offices were opened across the country. At registration, the business received a corporate taxpayer 
number, social security number, commercial registration and a declaration of business situation. In the short run, there were increased registration of small business -(0-5 employees) by 17% and 7 new jobs 
were created per 100,000 inhabitants. However, because of the reduction in costs, among the additional firms that 
entered were more 'marginal' businesses and were operated by entrepreneurs with limited experience and are using 
lower types of technologies, which were then less likely to survive in the long run. If barriers are reduced, then more marginal firms will register and an increased rate of failure should 
be expected. Churn can be a measure of effective reallocation of resources in the economy. Increased enforcement of rules can also drive up registration as the perceived costs of informality rise. 
In Sri Lanka 12 in 2008, less than 0.5% of unregistered micro firms reported paying a fine, penalty or bribe 
in the last year because of their unregistered status. Fewer than 10% reported interaction with officials at 
all in the past year. In experiment, a small incentive dramatically increased registration rates. The most 
common concerns were about becoming liable for tax and labour regulations, about which the owners 
knew very little. For most, registration made no impact on their profitability (they were below the tax 
threshold) or use of bank accounts or loans, participation in government programs or receipt of government 
contracts. Although there is a fiscal benefit from the registration of larger informal firms, it is unclear whether 
there is a public rationale for attempting to formalize subsistence enterprises. 10 Klapper, Leora, and Inessa Love. 2010.  " The Impact of Business Environment Reforms on New Firm Registration. "  World Bank Policy

No.6442 10 What is a business register? A registry is where the laws governing the formation of companies or enterprises, the creation and 
enforcement of contracts and the formalization of collecting and storing of essential information on which 
economic activity is based intersect. The register may also include non-incorporated businesses, such as 
sole traders/proprietorships, partnerships or other legal forms. A registry typically contains answers to questions such as, 'Who makes the decisions in a company or 
enterprise and benefits from them?' i.e. who are the shareholders, the directors and the beneficial owners, 
'Who has the legal authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the company or enterprise?', and 'At what 
address should legal notices be served?' Specific national requirements vary considerably, reflecting the local legal and administrative context 
(e.g. local/ national responsibilities), how far compliance is expected or approval required in advance. 11 I. GOOD PRACTICE IN CUSTOMER ORIENTATION Customer orientation is an approach in which objectives are defined around satisfying the customers, 
registering businesses, while achieving the policy objective of high registration compliance to enable 
sustainable economic growth. It means arranging processes around the needs of new businesses rather than the ease of existing 
agency structures. Institutions, laws and procedures may all need to be changed to make the new processes 
effective and efficient. Agencies will need to work with businesses and organisations skilled in business 
support to understand what a business needs, when it needs it, and provide it in the way that is simplest and 
cheapest for the business. As a new business needs to interact with many areas of government policy – company law, taxation, 
labour law and employee protection to name but a few, this means that many public laws and functions are 
relevant. This goes far beyond the Ministry responsible for commerce and requires close interaction with 
relevant ministries and stakeholders. It is undeniably difficult and risky to change everything at once. As a 
result, most countries make improvements on a step-by-step basis. Business should be able to expect:  a reduction or elimination of capital deposit requirements  a review of historical requirements  a goal-based approach to company or enterprise formation and termination, with simple standard 
models  to eliminate duplication of information obligations  easy access to clear, accurate information about what is required  a simple and practical process to follow  transparent service standards (speed, timeliness, feedback and redress)  incentives aligned to promote compliance The legal requirements for business registration come from company law. However, business 
registration is not the only requirement before a company can legally operate. There are other registrations, 
permits and licences required. Everything that the public sector requires before a business can legally 
operate should be considered as part of the 'start-up' process. An effective and efficient process requires well designed laws and regulations, effective co-ordination 
among national and regional agencies – with coherent policy objectives legal backing, clearly defined 12 responsibilities, adequate and well-trained registration, permit/licensing and enforcement resources and 
effective consultation. A dynamic approach should be adapted to improving systems over time, with reforms carried out in a 
logical order and effectively evaluated. Pillar 1: Minimise formal requirements Reduce or eliminate capital requirements Minimum capital requirements significantly slow entrepreneurship. 13 Such requirements also fail to 
serve their intended purpose of protecting consumers and creditors from hastily established and potentially 
insolvent firms 14 . In recent years many governments have stopped requiring new businesses to deposit 
minimum capital in banks or with notaries before they can begin operations. As access to finance is 
probably the largest barrier to MSME growth 15 , capital deposit requirements should be a priority. Box 3. International elimination of minimum capital deposit requirements The Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) has encouraged member states to 
reduce their minimum capital requirements. Seven member states have already passed national legislation to this 
effect in 2014/15, and were followed by six more in 2015/16. In 2016, the government of Indonesia passed Government Regulation No. 7 of 2016, which abolished the 
formerly imposed minimum capital requirement for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) previously amounting 
to 31% income per capita. Review historical requirements When reviewing requirements, requirements that were obvious in the past can be reconsidered. For 
instance, in an increasingly digital age, is a carved Company Seal really a necessity? Historically, common 
seals were the standard means by which a company would execute documents and they had to be affixed to 
deeds. In a world of electronically verified signatures, what role should they now play? Does anyone check 
a seal now? Box 4. Who uses a company seal? Australia: The Company Law Review Act 1988 abolished the requirement for a company to have a seal, and the 
need for documents to be executed under seal. Hong Kong, China: The use of a common seal, or company seal, was made optional in starting a business 
under the new Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622). A company can now execute a document either by signature or 
using a common seal, at their discretion. Cambodia: A seal is still required although the Law on Commercial Enterprises, Article 115 states, 'An 
instrument or agreement executed on behalf of a company by a director, an officer or an agent of the company is not 
invalid merely because a corporate seal is not affixed thereto. (Note: many legal and financial transactions in 
Cambodia use a combination of signature with photocopy of ID card or thumbprint) 13 vanStel, Storey and Thurik (2007); Blanch-flower, Oswald and Stutzer (2001); Klapper and Love (2011); Dreher and Gassebner (2011) 
14 Why are minimum capital requirements a concern for entrepreneurs? Doing Business Annual Report 2014 
15 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises around the world: How many are there and what affects the count? Kushnir, Mirmulstein, Ramalho, 
World Bank/IFC 2010 13 Some countries still have a separate and relatively expensive step to check and reserve the proposed 
company name. If the business register is open online, could the entrepreneur choose whether to check it or 
get legal or other business service support to assure the name is within the rules? If a company or 
enterprise can be registered immediately, what is the need for a name reservation period? Box 5. Checking the name of a new business in the UK The entrepreneur checks the name by themselves against the legal restrictions and the Companies House and 
Trademark Registers. They may have to change the name if someone complains and Companies House agrees it's 
'too like' a name registered before yours. Fewer than 10 cases per year are taken to the Company Names Tribunal. A goal-based approach to company formation and termination, with simple standard models but 
flexibility allowed if wanted The needs of small company start-ups and big companies are different and the risks they pose can be 
different too. The demands at registration should be the minimum needed to meet the relevant economic, 
social and environmental requirements. The corporate registry typically contains answers to questions such 
as, 'Who makes the decisions in a company and benefits from them?' i.e. who are the shareholders and the 
directors, 'Who has the legal authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the company?', and 'At what 
address should legal notices be served?' Especially for small companies, the use of this information should 
be reviewed and the benefits of more extensive information assessed against the costs. An entrepreneur 
may just want a simple clear requirement: 'Just tell me what to do'. Model company statutes are able to 
provide this. However, larger, more complex businesses value options for flexibility. Box 6. UK Company Law reform: 'Think Small First'-Some of the proposals for small businesses Legislation should provide a self-contained statement of the law for the small and private companies. More 
detailed provisions can be added for larger and public companies.  Simplify the law for private companies generally, by simplifying the model constitution, simplifying capital maintenance rules, removing the requirement to have a company secretary  Simplify the law further for  " owner-managed "  companies (owners and directors are the same people)  Simpler forms of report and accounts Exemption from audit for smallest companies. (Note: Latest review, after further modifications to the law, is that 
up to 90% of eligible companies take advantage of this exemption, broadly in line with the RIA and it is a valuable 
reduction in burden for small companies. The take-up of audit exemptions is generally lower for companies that 
reported having shareholders, lenders and/or external investors, suggesting that these companies may undergo audits 
to satisfy and provide confidence to these external parties.) Source: Modern Company Law, a Consultation Document from the Company Law Review Steering Group, March 2000 While the registration rationale is similar in all cases, in practice, the amount of information that they 
contain and what is publicly available differs substantially between countries. Besides the basic 
information -shareholders, directors, officers, and legal address, the law may also require the registry to 
hold and make public the articles of association, financial accounts, and the capital structure, including the 
types, numbers and rights of outstanding shares. 14 Box 7. Croatia – Simpler company form A 2012 law allowed a new, simpler form of Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Croatia, which also required a 
minimum capital of under $2 (cf $3,571 before). In the first 12 months, 8 407 simple LLCs were established and only 5 
488 of the old form were private LLCs. The Simple LLC cannot have more than three members/shareholders and can only have one member on its 
management. The simple company registration process is more user-friendly, via a prescribed form that needs to be 
filled by a Public Notary, stating only the intention to form a company, the list of members, the list of persons 
authorised to manage the company's business and acceptance of a member of the nomination to manage the 
company. The form is signed by all members and lodged electronically with the business court registry. Some jurisdictions, such as the UK, have allowed flexible entities. An objects clause was originally to 
do with the state's granting of a concession for private individual to 'operate a trade' and anything 
contracted outside those objects was considered null and void. Under Companies Act 2006, Article 31: (1) 
unless a company's articles specifically restrict the objects of the company, its objects are unrestricted. 
This allows innovative business models to develop and companies to take advantage of opportunities. 
These could range from the transformation of a manufacturing business into a service delivery business, a 
restaurant developing its own farming or vocational training to a physical school turning into online 
educational institutions. As technology enables faster change, this becomes more appropriate. It does make 
it hard to use business registers to signpost other relevant licensing or permitting requirements but this is 
rarely done anyway. It puts the onus back on the entrepreneur to check the regulations s/he is required to 
follow. It is worth noting that companies still have to be classified by SIC code for statistical purposes. Nonetheless, law in this area will continue to develop. For instance, due to concerns about illicit 
domestic and cross-border money laundering and tax evasion, discussions from the June 2013 G8 summit 
agreement ensured that companies should obtain and hold adequate, accurate, and up-to-date information 
on their beneficial owners. There has been subsequent G20 and EU action and this information is starting 
to be held in national registers. Clear rules and procedures for the closure of a business are also vital for market efficiency and 
confidence of investors and consumers. Attention to this area of law has tended to come after 
simplification of start-up arrangements and the variation in any chosen measure tends to be wider. The 
most significant issues are the cost – and how much of the value is lost in inefficient bankruptcy 
procedures, time taken and then the priority of claims and extent of court involvement. In many countries, 
the need to engage with the judicial system is a significant disincentive in seeking to recover money 
through insolvency proceedings but the ability to resolve commercial disputes, of whatever kind, is very 
important for a supportive business environment. Table 1. 1 Comparison of ASEAN member state performance on insolvency measures Brunei

5 15 Pillar 2: Elimination of multiple checks and validation in the process To eliminate duplication of information obligations Some countries put more emphasis on public officials ensuring that the information is accurate, while 
others put the onus on the applicant, and manage complaints if they arise. It is important that the cost and 
benefit to entrepreneurs, agencies, other businesses and the public are assessed; for example, name checks 
and notarization. A notary public is an official witness to the free and willing signing of one or more 
documents by one or more people whose identity the notary has verified. However, it plays a more limited 
role in protecting the proponents by ensuring the legal form or articles are suitable. Systems which require 
notarisation still often also require identity documents to be submitted for checking at registration. This 
often shows that requiring information to be notarized can be an expensive process for small companies 
and with limited benefits gained in the process. Nonetheless, as company law is clarified and documents 
are standardised, the need for legal advice for simple company formation is reduced. Box 8. Comparison of Company Memorandum and Articles of Association standardisation and notarisation The Articles of Association (or incorporation) along with the memorandum of association (if required) are the 
constitutional documents of a company. They set out the company's operating rules -the responsibilities of the 
directors, the kind of business to be undertaken, and the means by which the shareholders exert control over the board 
of directors. The Articles make the company a legal entity (legal personality). National rules vary:  
United Kingdom: At registration, companies are offered a standard ('model') template for the Memorandum 
and Articles of Association. If these are used, the company can be registered online directly.  
Myanmar: Applicant is given standard Memorandum and Articles when they reserve a company name. 
These will have to be certified (stamped) for a fee.  
Singapore: Companies limited by guarantee and unlimited companies must register articles of association, 
while for companies limited by shares, registration of articles is optional. If no articles are registered, 
then Table A in the Fourth Schedule of the Companies Act will be applicable by default as the articles of the 
company. In practice, companies tend to register their own customized versions of Table A.  
Indonesia: An applicant must arrange for a notary to obtain the standard form of the company deed and 
notarize company documents  
Philippines: Articles of incorporation and treasurer's affidavit must be notarized. Nonetheless, it is equally important to ensure that the data inserted in the company register are 
verified and that, if automated, do not get corrupted. Simplification processes must therefore go in parallel 
with the efficient co-ordination and integration of data across the different agencies. Administrative 
simplification can contribute to reducing informality, but must also be supported by strong investment. It is equally important to understand what is required from a business and to tailor-fit this in the 
business registration system, For example, a more integrated system would ensure that businesses are able 
to obtain authorization at once and minimise the need to provide information multiple times. Easy access to clear, accurate information about what is required How far should a potential business owner have to go to find out what they need to do to start up? The 
information should be widely available and accurate. The internet is littered with sites with out-of-date 
requirements that were not changed when the law was reformed. This is even more often true for the 16 translations. How far are national languages and local institutions respected? This is the first stage of 
making the regulatory process transparent. Involve businesses and experts in giving support to businesses 
in preparing the material in a way that works best for new businesses. A simple and practical process to follow Regulatory and administrative procedures should be streamlined and transparent. There should be the 
fewest sensible number of procedures required within a time frame e.g. only one at any time. Agencies 
should work with representative groups to design the processes and make sure that feedback is asked for, 
welcomed, and is used to make improvements. Best practice is to use impact assessment – with even 
simple cost-benefit assessment – to assess the value of changes. The aim should be to minimise aggregate 
regulatory burden in order to stimulate economic efficiency, while achieving intended benefits of the 
regulation. Consider both types of cost: (1) actual cost of complying with the rules, such as hiring a notary 
and (2) the administrative cost of dealing with the process, such as the time spent going to the agency 
office or making five copies of the documents. Involving stakeholders in the process, and learning more 
about their experiences, will help make these cost-benefit estimates more realistic. It is also a good idea to check if the requirements are practical. For example, it would necessary to 
ensure that certain requirements do not create a situation where a bank cannot open an account for a 
business which is not in the registered but the law also requires evidence of a bank deposit before a 
business could be registered. Pillar 3: Commit to time frames Transparent service standards (speed, timeliness, feedback and redress) A way of driving improvement is to set measures for the standard of the service that can be expected, 
and then to set targets and publish performance. Speed is important for businesses. Agencies should set targets for maximum response and processing 
times. If time limits are defined, then a decision is needed regarding what happens when the limit is 
reached. A few jurisdictions have a 'Silence is Consent' rule: if the deadline is passed without certification 
or explicit objection, the business is automatically considered registered. This approach was pioneered in 
Italy and currently enforced in Armenia, Georgia and Morocco 16 . An alternative is 'Silence is Negation' 
where the business can immediately appeal as it is assumed that the application has been rejected. Table 2.1. Singapore – ACRA Service Standards (extract) Business Registration Department Registration of new business

Agencies should also offer clear appeals process. It is best practice for the appeal to be considered by someone other than the 
original official. Box 9. Examples of administrative appeals processes WASHINGTON STATE Reconsideration is used when you identify a mistake of law or fact made in the determination that could change 
the result of your decision. This process is available for mainstream cases only. When does a petition for reconsideration have to be made? The written petition for reconsideration must be postmarked or delivered by the due date shown on the decision 
(plus any extensions granted prior to the due date). What happens if a petition for reconsideration is not filed on time? When the petition for reconsideration is not filed on time, the decision becomes final. If you do not pay the 
assessment by the due date, additional interest and penalties will accrue. Can I request an extension for filing a petition for reconsideration? Yes. An extension may be granted on the same grounds as other petitions. What should I include in a petition for reconsideration? A petition for reconsideration must identify specific mistakes in law or fact that requires reconsideration. If you fail 
to specify mistakes of law or fact, your petition for reconsideration may be summarily dismissed without a hearing. You must include any new documents and explanations with your petition for reconsideration. If your petition for 
reconsideration is accepted, it will be assigned to the original TRO so that any errors in fact or law can be corrected 
and new arguments and information addressed. Will there be a reconsideration hearing? Most petitions for reconsideration can be decided without a hearing. The TRO may decide to hold a 
reconsideration hearing in some cases. How will I be informed of the reconsideration decision? The TRO will issue a written reconsideration decision and send it by regular US mail to you and your authorized 
representative. AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS REGISTER If you are not satisfied with a decision that has been made on behalf of the Registrar of the Australian Business 
Register, please call our information line first so we can try to resolve the issue. If you are still not satisfied you have 
the right to lodge an objection. You have 60 days from the date you received the decision to lodge an objection. When we receive an objection, we review the facts and evidence you provide and come to a decision. We may 
contact you or your representative to discuss your objection or request further information. We will let you know if your 
objection will take longer than usual to decide (for example, because it raises complex matters). Both these organisations have further appeals processes to the courts. Pillar 4: Inform businesses of their rights Incentives aligned to promote compliance Despite the potential benefits, most businesses see registration, at best, as a necessary evil -something 
they have to do before they can get on with their real activities. So as well as making it as simple as 
possible, government should make sure that the incentives to comply are aligned as well. 19 Examples of relevant action could include additional start-up advice being offered alongside 
registration or to newly registered businesses or tax breaks for small registered businesses. Enforcement 
should be well targeted and supportive of compliance: registering a business must not be an opportunity for 
rent-seeking behaviour by officials. If a level playing field is particularly important, such as of food outlets 
for public health, then there should be compliance checks for all businesses operating in that field. Box 10. Business registration compliance and enforcement thinking: Some examples from Malaysia  
Links to support and advice. At incorporation, the business is automatically registered with specified 
authorities and with the SME Corp. This is a network of 'one-stop centres' for business advisory services, 
relevant information on Government funds and incentives for SMEs, including tax incentives, and also 
provides a channel for feedback on SME issues.  
Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM). SSM is a strong proponent of the philosophy of  " enforcement by 
education " . With the 'Balanced Enforcement' approach, SSM believes that education complements the 
effectiveness of enforcement initiatives in ensuring voluntary compliance. The Companies Commission of 
Malaysia Training Academy (COMTRAC) was established in 2007 to educate stakeholders and strengthen 
public awareness about the need, importance, and benefits of complying with corporate legal provisions. 
Since implementing this approach, the compliance rate has improved from 40% in the early 2000s to 93% in 
2016.  
Tax compliance. The approach includes an education and outreach programme (including one-stop service 
counters at tax offices), verification (surveillance, public information gathering, cooperation with other 
government agencies for data matching between asset acquisitions e.g. through stamp duty on property, 
motor vehicle registrations and insurance) and tax payer database), and enforcement Source: SME Corp and SSM websites, https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2013/asiatax/pdfs/malaysia1.pdf Singapore uses the power of IT to generate and send reminders for Annual General Meetings and 
annual returns to the businesses at its registered office address and to all officers of the business at their 
residential address. If the deadline for filing the return is passed, the system will again generate reminders 
to the business and its officers giving them a grace period to rectify the default. Once the grace period has 
passed and the AR has not been filed, the records will be transmitted to the State Courts. II. GOOD PRACTICE IN JOINED-UP GOVERNMENT Pillar 5: Have a credible system for reviewing regulations In the past when societal problems were less complex and information flowed more slowly, 
governments could deal with matters in a 'top-down', hierarchical arrangement. However, with IT services 
offering the possibility for more personalised and connected services, this approach no longer works so 
well. Even an apparently simple issue, such as registering a company, is not usefully contained within 
ministerial or agency boundaries. A business should not have to supply the same information to more than 
one government body. 20 One term to capture this type of development is 'joined-up government'. The New Labour 
Government in Britain, in 1997, coined the term to mean enhancing coordination and integration within the 
public sector. It was not only about removing organisational boundaries but also the need to align targets, 
incentives (such as joint funding, pooled budgets and linking remuneration to joined-up targets), structures, 
and cultures of authority in order to fit tasks that cross organisational boundaries. Experience shows that this breaking of silos is the most difficult change management agenda of all. It 
is common to create new structures and processes to oversee and account for the delivery of outcomes. 
Such arrangements are usually needed both at the political level (such as cabinet sub-committees or 
horizontal ministerial portfolios) and within the administrative system (such as cross-departmental working 
groups or inter-agency task forces). In some cases, local or bottom-up cooperation is more innovative and 
successful and has lessons to offer for any joined-up government initiative. Greater use of e-technology is 
often part of the solution but it is far from the only approach that is needed. Governments should:  make effective use of one-stop shops  ask for information only once  consider a unique business identifier  make appropriate use of ICT  provide appropriate protection for data  implement simple and transparent fees and payment systems  take the opportunity to reform business licensing too Key features of the British initiative included new structures such as cross-departmental policy and 
delivery units and the allocation of cross-cutting portfolios to ministers. In New Zealand, standardised 
governance arrangements for public service agencies were introduced. In Australia, a number of one-stop-
shops were created at both federal and state level to provide easier citizen access to services. In Singapore, 
successive e-government action plans provided the basis of greater service integration and accessibility. 
Cross-agency project teams are now commonly used to tackle inter-agency matters and, through its use of 
standards-based infrastructure, application services and supporting processes and procedures, Singapore 
has emerged as one of the world leaders in e-services. Many countries often work within silos within and across institutions that are responsible for business 
registration. This therefore makes it challenging to bring together like-minded institutions to adopt 
meaningful changes in business registration practices. Performance management and incentive systems can 
play a role in influencing institutional behaviour to shift from silo and vertical administration to horizontal 
governance to further promote good business registration practices. However, there are also many examples of failures in joined-up government initiatives, particularly in 
the area of e-government and the use of IT to integrate services. Based on international experience, a 
number of common critical success factors towards achieving joined-up government can be identified. 
These include: (1) the identification of clear objectives and political commitment; (2) the existence of 
viable structures (particularly at lower levels of government); and (3) the allocation of an appropriate 
budget and the alignment of that budget with joined-up goals and clear accountability lines. For public 21 servants used to working in discrete parts of the public sector, engaging in substantive joined-up 
government work requires emphasis on particular values including collaboration, integration, innovation, 
risk-taking and flexibility. Make effective use of one-stop shops The one-stop-shop concept is the arrangement of functions together for the convenience of the 
customer, in the way a mall or supermarket/hypermarket does for a shopper. The one-stop shop can be 
physical or online, provide only information or also used for transactional processes. At best, a business 
can be set up in a single visit and with a single (affordable) payment. In reality there is a continuum of varieties of one-stop shop, from a single door with information 
board into separate agency functions to a single desk dealing with all functions, a single visit or single 
interaction online platform, and single payment points. In the past, in many civil law countries, notaries coordinated company start-up procedures, effectively 
compensating for the failure of various government offices to work together. For the entrepreneur, the 
notary was the one-stop shop. Some bodies, which have become known as 'one more stop shops' are there 
simply to co-ordinate the activities of other agencies on behalf of the entrepreneur – they are additional 
administrative step but at least it's a single, hopefully friendly face to deal with. Several countries, including Colombia, Portugal, and Estonia, have concluded that, for 
straightforward incorporations, a notary is not necessary. In Belgium, Italy, and Spain notaries have 
become key intermediaries for electronic filing. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, company 
incorporation agents have for many years been active as  " one-stop shop "  intermediaries and are finding a 
new role in connection with electronic filing, but there is no obligation to use their services. The first inter-agency coordination is usually between business registration and basic business tax 
registration. Both agencies can often see the links and the potential for simplification. The next most 
common registrations are for labour requirements but these are much more rarely included. European 
experience is that it can be very difficult for other agencies to see how they benefit from the one-stop shop 
and the lead agency has often had little or no contact with them before, making communication harder still. 
The Albanian National Registration Centre is one of the few examples where investors can complete all the 
procedures for business registration, registration for health insurance, social insurance and labour 
directorate registration, with a single application. But they must then register separately at the Municipality 
Bureau of Internal Revenue. Benin established a One-stop shop, Guichet Unique de Formalisation des 
Entreprises (GUFE), as a single access point to post-registration requirements -tax declaration, application 
for import and export licences, tradesman card, registration with ministry of trade and affiliation with 
Social Security Office. Only later did the commercial registry join, for approval of incorporation 
documents. Box 11. Singapore – OneStopShop@ACRA, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority A new business registers with ACRA and is then given the option to register for one of the following services: Domain Name Reservation Open Bank Account Register for Goods and Services Tax Activate Customs Account 22 Subscribe to free e-newsletter Sign up for GeBiz Alerts All the above services are managed by other agencies. If the applicant signs up for any of them, the details are 
sent by ACRA to the relevant agency. Few governments have tried to combine regulatory requirements and other MSME business support 
activity in their one-stop shops. Australia has adopted a single portal approach -business.gov.au -for all 
government information, transactions and services. It is marketed as a whole-of-government service 
providing essential information on planning, starting, running and selling or closing a business, as well as 
access to business compliance requirements. The Philippines Negosyo centres are another rare example, 
aiming to provide business registration assistance, business advisory services, and business information 
and advocacy. How well do one-stop shops deal with local registration and other regulatory requirements? Box 12. Finding out about local requirements for a business In the USA, Business licenses and permit are found at every level of government (federal, state, region, county, 
city). administrations seem largely to have made use of on-line portals to help businesses establish the nature and 
scope of required permits and other requirements. The U.S. Small Business Administration provides a  " Business 
Licenses and Permits tool "  which helps business identify the licenses and permits that they require and provides links 
to web pages, application forms and instructions. The tool also includes links to portals for each of the fifty states. In Australia, the Business License & Information Service (ABLIS) provides location-specific information on 
required state licenses and permits. Most businesses require some form of local -municipal/regional/provincial -registration but 
decentralization, deconcentration and devolution have often created cultural and technical barriers to 
making these links. The largest attempts to achieve this are the European Points of Single Contact which will be discussed 
later. Provide information once only A business should not have to supply the same information to more than one government body. As 
well as being a waste of time, it makes data entry errors far more likely and failure to update information in 
all systems almost inevitable. Enabling a single data provision requires cooperation between agencies, at 
the least making them share data. Further developments range from consolidating registrations into a single 
application to interconnecting databases or registries. In 2016, it was reported that over 80% of corporate registries share info with other public agencies 
and over 50% take information from other agencies, for instance, sharing registration with tax authority or 
checking IDs. For example, from 1 May 2015, India reduced the number of forms required to incorporate and start a 
business to just one, INC-29. Until then, it had required a minimum of 8 forms with much duplication of 
the information, including one each for a digital signature certificate, approval of the company name, 
registration of the memorandum and articles of the company, approval of the registered office and a 
separate form for every director. 23 Since 2005, Norway has required all public registers and public administrations to use the data in the 
Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities instead of asking businesses again for the data. Box 13. How far is information shared between the business registry and tax authority in ASEAN countries? Brunei Darussalam – The Registry of Companies notifies the Collector of Income Tax of the company's registration 
and basic details. The company collects a letter from the registry to take to the tax office. Cambodia and Indonesia – The company must register for tax separately. Lao PDR – The company gets a letter for the tax office when registered at Enterprise Registration Office. Philippines – The company is issued a Taxpayer Identification Number at registration but must still register in person 
with Bureau of Internal Revenue Malaysia – The company must register separately for income tax and PAYE. This is done online after receiving the 
MyCOID number. To register for GST the company needs to submit further details with to Royal Malaysian customs. Myanmar – companies are obliged to register for commercial tax with the tax authorities one month before the start of 
their business and inform the tax authorities within 10 days of starting a business. Each month the Company 
Registration Office also sends a list of newly registered to the relevant townships for cross-checking. Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam – Information for tax officials are automatically registered at business registration. Source: World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2016 
Note: Because of national variation between time and thresholds, VAT registration is often a separate activity Pillar 6: Move towards a unique business identifier The next developments are the use of a unique ID for individual and legal entity, then linking all 
information to that entity. There is a basic data integrity improvement from using a unique ID but the full 
efficiency benefits for an economy depend on all trading entities being in the same system. For instance in 
New Zealand, 19 percent of actively trading businesses in New Zealand are sole traders, 15 percent are 
trusts, and 12 percent are partnerships. A further four percent of entities that are not businesses in the 
traditional sense undertake business activity, such as government agencies and the not-for-profit sector. 
The full benefits (network effects) of the NZBN to the wider economy depend on all of these having an 
NZBN. Box 14. New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) NZBN is a universal identifier which will enable businesses to easily update, share key information and interact 
with each other and the public sector. NZBN has been introduced to streamline all essential business information, and 
over time will become the only number businesses will need to use to interact with a range of other businesses and 
government agencies. Both registered and unincorporated businesses may have an NZBN. Government agencies will progressively recognise businesses by their NZBN. Linking information between these 
agencies and businesses will also lead to improved data quality and reduced rework. Concerns raised during 
consultation focused on maximising the benefits of the NZBN, while protecting the privacy of individuals in business, 
such as sole traders. The success of the NZBN depends on rapid uptake of the number by businesses and state sector agencies. This 
is needed to build momentum for infrastructure development and private investment in commercial opportunities. 
Otherwise it becomes another number, rather than the intended replacement for the many current identifiers. Source: Cabinet Circular CO (16) 3 to all Departments, Ministerial Direction to Crown Entities issued under Section 107 of the 24 Crown Entities Act 2004, NZBN regulatory impact statement, May 2014 Pillar 7: Make effective use of ICT There is ever-increasing use of computer systems for managing corporate registration systems, for 
back office data storage, for giving information, to allow documents to be sent and finally to enable online 
registration. Streamlining registries and databases offers faster processing and helps to meet growing 
demands for company information within government for reduction of duplication and regulatory 
oversight. It improves data integrity by reducing reduce the number of times information has to be given. It 
can improve access for firms operating at a distance from registrar's offices and application forms can even 
be pre-filled with information already held on other government systems. But all too often, even sites that work are not user-friendly. Operators and applicants need to be able 
to find simple information about what they have to do, save their application part-way through, have access 
to help to complete any forms or attach or retrieve documents and so on. Even navigating around the 
system has to be carefully thought through e.g. the Bulgarian Point of Single Contact has an A-Z search 
facility, but licensing is under 'A' for 'Application for …' rather than the activity that the licence covers. Box 15. E-enabling changes in corporate registries in 2015 Albania introduced electronic signature for the first time. Arizona, USA implemented online LLC formation. Brazil (Alagoas Maceio) introduced a digital registry for sole traders. Colombia implemented e-filing for incorporation and changes. Denmark implemented a brand new digital registration solution that increases quality of registration. It enables 
automatic checks and facilitates users to do additional types of registrations online. Gibraltar introduced electronic consultation, electronic archive and electronic filing on essential documents. Hong Kong launched a full-scale electronic filing service, covering all specified forms. The registration process can be 
completed in less than 24 hours for specified forms that are submitted electronically and processed automatically. In Ireland, since June 2015, registration of charges (mortgages-security interests) can only be completed 
electronically. Macedonia (The Former Yugoslav Republic) introduced electronic filing of changes. Norway extended the scope of the types of applications that are processed electronically and automatically by the 
business register. Automated procedures include several types of notifications to the register, such as change of 
business address, email address, mailing address, auditor, CEO and a few more. In addition to this, they have 
introduced a full electronic to enable the whole process, from incorporation to registration of the limited liability 
company, to be done electronically. Israel launched a web system for electronic filing of applications for registration of companies and changes to 
company information. Mongolia updated their law governing the web-based entity registration. Qatar recently launched an e-service portal. Spain introduced new legal provisions making e-filing of accounts mandatory and governing electronic 
documents for the registration of sole traders with limited liability. Source: The International Business Registers Report 2016 (ASORLAC, CRF, ECRF AND IACA) 25 Business registries are generally leading the way in these e-enabled registry solutions, with the 
pressure and support from large companies to help them deliver improvements. But, as every organisation 
knows, getting IT systems to work sounds easier than it is in reality. Although data is limited, survey and 
poll results about e-government initiatives in developing/transitional countries show that 35% are total 
failures, 50% are partial failures and only 15% are successful 17 . Even in highly developed economies, IT 
projects rightfully have poor reputations. Box 16. Austria – implementation of web portal for business registration In Austria, www.usp.gv.at is estimated to have reduced companies' costs by €100 -€300 million. The site's 
success since launch has been seen in significant user growth. The portal has, at the same time, been a medium for administrative reform, in particular improvement of 
processes and the elimination of multiple notifications. Further benefits have been better data quality, and reduced maintenance and set-up costs for new e-Gov 
applications, with savings of up to €20 million expected by 2016. Use of www.usp.gv.at : 2010

47% The success of the Austrian site is seen as a function of its speed and relevance, which resulted from:  Involving senior politicians and administrators from the very start to ensure project support;  Putting in place an appropriate legal framework to support the e-Gov project;  Recognising that organisational and legal aspects can be more challenging than technical 
problems – and planning accordingly;  Co-operating with a wide range of business-related partners to ensure a high quality of 
information; and  Ensuring collaboration across government (federal and regional), and recognising this takes time. As well as the need to simplify the process and authorisations before bringing specifying an online 
process, the computer and e-infrastructure has to be reliable, sufficient trained and competent staff 
available and the applicants need support. In developing economies, where rural systems may still, or until 
recently have been, paper based, these changes are significant. There is also a more fundamental question, 
particularly in developing economies, about access to online systems. While mobile penetration is growing 
dramatically, this doesn't necessarily mean that even tech-savvy entrepreneurs have computer screen 
access. Can the portals be truly responsive (mobile-friendly) and is the support available compatible with 
using the same device to fill in the form? 17 eGovernment for Development Information Exchange, coordinated by the University of Manchester's Institute for Development Policy and 
Management 26 Provide appropriate protection of data Particularly when systems are being brought online, issues of data protection and the risks of identity 
theft have to be considered. Most registry applications require at least a username and password and the 
option of automatic notification, if registration details are changed. Within the EU, 17 Member States have 
stronger electronic identification (eID) systems but cross-border recognition remains to be seen. Box 17. eID implementation for businesses in Denmark NemID consists of a user ID, password, and a keycard with  " keys "  (time codes). When an employee logs on, they 
must enter their user ID and password and the code from the keycard. This indicates they are authorized to contact 
public authorities, access secure portals and data and sign documents on behalf of the business. A business may request up to 3 free NemID signatures for its employees. Enable online applications In addition, a problem with all these automated processes is the verification of signatures. We 
discussed earlier some of the issues with notarisation of signatures on company documents. The use of 
electronic communication presents further challenges. The acceptance of records of approval reduces 
markedly along the spectrum from pen and paper, through photograph, fax and scan to digital and e-
signatures. In ASEAN alone, the full spectrum of forms is used. In Cambodia, many legal documents are still 
signed by thumbprint which is perceived as more secure than a written signature and is often accompanied 
by photocopy of the individual's ID card. Scans of original documents are not widely accepted although it 
is probably legally enforceable. However, in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, a digital signature is 
accepted while Singapore has recently adopted the use of e-signature. In a similar way that requiring bank transfer for fee payment would increase the number of businesses 
with a bank account or perhaps create a barrier to registration, the acceptance and use of the next form of 
signature approval along the spectrum could incentivise its recognition in general commerce. Box 18. 'e-signature' systems Electronic signature An electronic signature is, like its paper equivalent, a legal concept adopted by a person with the intent to sign a 
record. An electronic signature can be broken down into these components:  A method of signing  Data authentication  User authentication  Capture of intent Digital Signature A digital signature refers only to the encryption / decryption technology on which an electronic signature solution 
is built. Digital signature encryption secures the data associated with a signed document and helps verify the 
authenticity of a signed record. Used alone, it cannot capture a person's intent to sign a document or be legally bound 27 to an agreement or contract. Implement simple and transparent fees and payment systems Best practice is for all types of public sector registration and permit/license requirements to be 
available at a flat fee, set simply to cover processing and any related costs, such as mandatory publication 
of information. Some countries have chosen, for a time, to incentivise business registration by making it 
free. This helps reduce the costs of entry but is not sustainable. Roughly 50% of corporate registries 
globally are fully funded by fees collected while the rest receive government support or funding. Box 19. Companies House – example fees and payments (1) Company registration  Online (using standard articles): £12, payable by debit, credit card, or PayPal.  By post: £40, payable by cheque.  Same day registration: £100. Get application at Companies House by 3pm. Note: All Companies House fees are set by regulation, fees shown are as of February 2016. Requiring fee payment through a bank can encourage the commercial use of banking and reduce the 
opportunity for informal payments. However, across many countries, a significant proportion of the 
population is unbanked, including entrepreneurs. This means that it is probably too early to mandate 
payment by bank transfer. The local context must be taken into account when checking whether sufficient 
branches are available to make this practical, or whether, for instance, MFI should become involved. Governments are starting to consider single payment points for individual and business interaction 
with government. Drivers range from convenience and efficiency to transparency and reducing the 
opportunity for corruption. Box 20. Canberra, Australia: Framework for the payment of ACT Government bills The objective is to accelerate business engagement with the digital economy, help businesses access new 
customers and markets and to continue to remove red tape. It will provide: a) Consistency in service offering – progressively standardising the suite of payment services and bill 
presentation across government, while taking into account the limitations of the current systems and the needs of 
specific business or regulatory processes b) Facilitate a staged approach to electronic notification and presentment of bills to the community c) Implement strategies to further promote electronic payment to government. The key principles for the policy are: a) Cost effective for government – direct transactional costs (bank fees, payment infrastructure etc) must be as 
cost effective as possible given the transaction value and volume 28 b) Process efficient – downstream processing costs (impact on other parts of government etc) must be as 
efficient as possible c) Customer convenience – simple and cost effective options for the customer d) Digital first – new services must be designed with a digital payment solution foremost allowing customer choice 
of digital service e) Adaptable – payment methods that are flexible, ensure fit for purpose while able to adapt to emerging payment 
trends and facilities. Source: ACT Government Bill Payment Policy 2015 Box 21. GOV.UK Pay The objective is a uniform payments platform to allow government bodies to improve the way they reconcile 
payments across multiple payment methods, such as debit cards, credit cards and digital wallets. The UK government knows that a cross-government platform cannot be developed in isolation. It needs 
collaboration, business process analysis, and lots of user research. The discussions have already taken place with 
many colleagues across government to find out how they currently take payments and how that could be improved. 
That research is being intensified and is focussing on taking credit and debit card payments for some online 
transactions of the first partners: Companies House, Environment Agency, Home Office and Ministry of Justice. An important way in which corporate registration enables the economy is by reducing the risk of 
business-business transactions by allowing the contracting partners to know that each other are legal and 
currently active and solvent. This information is a type of public good (the value and availability is not 
reduced by use) and is usually provided free. It should be highly accessible. More detailed data is often 
legally accessible but charged for. Other permits and licences are also often displayed at the business 
premises but less often accessible online. Box 22. Companies House – example fees and payments (2) Information services  Online search of all public data held on companies – free of charge e.g. basic company information and status, nature of business, date of last and next accounts, full transaction filing, mortgage charge data and 
disqualified directors details  Search company information using WebCHeck – basic information free, £1 per document image  Companies House Direct subscription service – access to all 130million documents held, going back 20 years. Subscription £4 per month and £1 per document image  Historical company records, document packages, company reports and appointments and detailed mortgage information. Can be sorted by company or individual. Note: All Companies House fees are set by regulation, fees shown are as of February 2016. 29 Pillar 8: Take the opportunity for business licensing reform This can be a significant regulatory reform project in its own right and is often more politically 
sensitive than other business registration reform, because the costs and benefits are more distributed. It 
must be undertaken within the national contexts of de-concentration and de-centralisation. For many 
countries, even the first step of collating current requirements will be difficult in itself. Small business 
representative organisations should be involved as well as business support intermediaries. 30 III. FEATURES OF A MODERN NATIONAL BUSINESS REGISTRATION SYSTEM Starting or formalising a business should appear to the business, so far as possible, as a single step. It 
is the public sector's responsibility to make the connections to different agencies work behind the scenes. Company law should offer simple legal forms for businesses with standard or model templates, capital 
deposit requirements reduced or eliminated, and the need for the use of intermediaries, such as notaries, 
removed. There must be clear decisions on whether micro-enterprises, sole traders and other non-
incorporated businesses should be included in the register: a single register may be simpler to maintain. It 
is best practice for registration to be an administrative not judicial process. The process should be simple for the applicant. Best practice is to manage this through accessible one-
stop shops, including virtual presence, with clear inter-agency commitments, funding and performance 
targets. These services could be provided by a government agency or could also be sub-contracted out. 
They should provide clear information on all registration and common licensing/permitting requirements. 
Any need for rare and highly specialised assessment e.g. major hazard installations and sources of non-
standard support, such as sector-specific grants, should be signposted. The interface should be developed 
and improved in collaboration with business representative groups and using the skills of those who 
regularly provide support to start-ups. There should be no duplication of information requests and a single application form should be used 
where possible, with requirements only separated if there is a clear reason to do so, e.g. if VAT registration 
is not required until after many months of trading. An online process should be available but, recognising local contexts, probably a paper and face-to-
face option too available reasonable locally, with support on request in all cases so that forms can be 
completed correctly first time. ASEAN has a young demographic, some with high IT skills, alongside a 
sometimes less literate older generation and incomplete infrastructure including electrification. For 
example, while there is high mobile penetration, computer access is more limited. Only 40% of the 
population have internet access 18 . There should be transparent service standards, mechanisms for feedback and redress and a minimum 
flat fee – set to cover only processing costs and transferrable electronically. Government should move towards a unique business identifier for all interaction with public agencies, 
national and local, and consider the development of a single payment point to government. Many of these elements, such as accepting online communication, shared data access and single 
application forms, will require legislation. Enforcement should be designed to support business growth while achieving compliance. The public 
sector must consider who should have access to which parts of the information, for each agency, and how 
to maintain data protection while allowing suitable transparency and search. For instance, for the business 
registry, government will want to enable domestic companies to join global value chains. Allowing easy 
access to trustworthy registry information enables due diligence processes by larger players in the supply 
chain, reducing the risk for them of contracting with local companies. 18 www.techinasia.com/talk/digital-southeast-asia-q4-2015 31 Challenges and policy recommendations for ASEAN ASEAN is committed to streamlining business permit and registration, to enable less costly and faster 
business formation. The Strategic Action Plan for SME Development 2016-2025 includes the 
establishment of one-stop shops, benchmarking for registration and obtaining construction permits and 
registering property and improving the capacity of policy makers to design, simplify and implement such 
systems. POLICY RECOMMENDATION 1: Simplify legal company forms and requirements, such as capital 
deposit There are opportunities for simplification in company forms and requirements in some ASEAN 
countries. This is a regulatory simplification process. There is good practice to follow, with impact assessment 
and cost-benefit calculation advice available. Both compliance costs and administrative costs should be 
considered, although the one-stop shop steps below will add to the administrative burden reduction. The 
priorities should be: 1.1 Minimise remaining capital deposit requirements 1.2 Offer a simple limited liability company form, with model company documents and minimum 
necessary requirements for registration. Revisit the rationale and benefits and costs of notarisation. 1.3 Reconsider the need for other elements such as the company seal or certified invoices. 32 Table 3.1 Legal requirements for starting a domestic business in ASEAN member states Brunei-

business. The average time needed, over 30 days, is skewed by outliers but there is room for improvement 
across the board. Bring together a team, with effective representatives from the agencies involved and very preferably 
the private sector, especially small businesses. Evaluate how well agency-business interaction is working. 2.1 Map the processes. Start by finding out what is really happening now. Detailed mapping of 
procedures invariably yields surprises and opportunities for improvement. 2.2 Simplify individual procedures and reassess whether they can be completed in parallel. Is it 
necessary to ask for certain checks before the next step can be taken e.g. authorisation to print invoices 
and receipts by specified printer then bring them back for stamping?. Use simple RIA, at least calculating 
the administrative burden cost compared with any evidence of real benefit. How will data be keep up to 
date? 2.3 Set a common approach to fees across different procedures. Are fees going to be flat rate and 
set to recover costs? How will this be measured? Will offices handle cash? Government may want to 
encourage banking but this will be a barrier for some. According to KPMG, in 2016, only 27% of Southeast Asia's population have a bank account. In Cambodia, for instance, this number is 5% 19 . 2.4 Establish a single business register for all types of enterprises. If possible, countries should 
look into the possibility of establishing a single business register for all business enterprises, which can be 
carried out in the process when adopting a one-stop shop approach (see policy recommendation 3). Once 
properly set and managed, this basic infrastructure has the potential to produce positive spill-over effects 
in statistical data collection, information for credit bureaus, legal documentation, etc. POLICY RECOMMENDATION 3: Build on the one-stop shop approach Build on the existing the one-stop shop approach – do not create another body 20 . The national one-
stop shops of the ASEAN Strategic Action Plan for SME Development are realistic and yet will be a 
major challenge for all member states to achieve across all locations. The barriers include infrastructure – 
such as electrification, civil service capacity and co-operation between ministries and local 
governments/authorities. ASEAN should consider surveying MSMEs about the barriers they face, or 
working with the World Bank Entrepreneurship/Enterprise Surveys, for instance, to explore more detail 
across the region. Note that successful improvements elsewhere have been developed and implemented 
step by step. Again, a team is essential, with effective representatives from the agencies involved and preferably 
the private sector, especially small businesses. Evaluate how well existing one-stop shops are doing. 3.1 Decide which processes to include first. Most ASEAN countries have started by integrating 
elements of tax registration into the business registry process. The next sizeable elements are labour 
requirements e.g. social security. Can there be a single form? Can the business have common number for 
the registrations – this could be a first step towards a unique business identifier? 19 KPMG 2016, reference: https://www.techinasia.com/talk/438m-unbanked-southeast-asia-fintech 
20 How many stops in a one-stop shop. A review of recent developments in Business Registration. IFC 2010 35 3.2 Simplify fees and payment. Can there be a single payment and can one office collect fees on 
behalf of all agencies? Does the One Stop Shop keep any of the fees? 3.3 Where should the shops be and how will they be staffed? What is the appropriate 
provincial/regional spread? Will offices be under national or sub-national control? 3.4 How does the business get information about what they need to do? At the One Stop Shop, 
online or from other lcoations? 3.5 Can the business deal with just one person. Can they get help with filling in the form(s)? 3.6 Set service standards. Set targets and establish monitoring needs. Make sure that it is possible 
for businesses to give feedback and that there is a procedure for this to be meaningfully dealt with. 3.7 Specify any computer system. Who will enter the data? Can the information be shared 
electronically with other organisations; consider data security and future interconnection needs. 3.8 Will there be an online filing option? This is the move from online information to transaction. 
Will the online option include payment and transmission of certificates? ASEAN has multi-speed 
economies within and between its member states. POLICY RECOMMENDATION 4: Consider other business permit / licensing requirements. GOV/RPC/SEA(2017)3 36 Table 3.3 Current one stop shops and combination of registration for business start-up in ASEAN member states Brunei-

to improve market efficiency. Regulatory heterogeneity or administrative barriers should not prevent 
companies from establishing themselves in the territory of other Member States. Cross-border trade has 
traditionally been the first area of cooperation. Regional free trade areas and customs unions have preceded 
economic integration and states have developed mechanisms for working together by creating systems to 
support these. An internal market is enabled by a degree of regulatory cooperation, based on the establishment of 
common regulatory goals and principles, taking into account the current policies and regulations in place, 
and the challenges faced by the different countries. The experience is that managing structures to resolve 
issues of harmonisation and create common approaches is not easy. The kind of issues that need to be addressed for regional business registration include key issues of 
company law such as company formation requirements and procedures, corporate governance, capital 
maintenance, mergers and acquisitions, accounting and audit, and market regulation 21 . After 10 years, EU 
member states are still struggling to implement achieve this. It requires excellent interconnection between 
national and local systems. Even at a less complex level, for example, few EU corporate registries have 
information or search functions in other languages, only about 50% will accept foreign language 
Memoranda and Articles, etc. even with certified translation and many have difficulties recognising foreign 
mobile numbers and bank account details. Box 23. A decade for the EU to make an interconnected regional business registry 2009: Directive 2009/01 – required certified copies of filings to be available electronically 2012: amended Directive 2012/17 – required Business Registries Interconnection System (BRIS) to be established. 2015: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/884 -technical specifications and procedures 2016: call for funding in 2016 for back-office but not national Access Points (18 month project) 2019: BRIS should be running, at least the back office For a competitive internal market, information must also flow freely. Useful business registration 
information includes business existence, insolvency, ownership, disqualification of directors. At the larger 
end of the commercial spectrum, cross-border takeovers, mergers and restructuring need to be recognised. 
It is also valuable to know when a business is just a branch from another jurisdiction – a subsidiary, not a 
separate legal entity. It is very common, across countries, to register these and most regimes give them a 
number. However, very few have yet managed to link this to their home registry number, which would 
help to keep the information up to date if the parent status changes. ASEAN is considering the benefits of 21 Source: Mustilli and Pelkmans 2013a, 2013b. 39 harmonization of information requirements for the establishment of companies and the creation of an 
official company register accessible by all Member States 22 . As covered earlier, business registration goes far beyond the initial corporate registration. To start 
operating in most jurisdictions, businesses require a host of other permissions, from requirements to do 
with employing people to sector-specific protections for issues such as health and safety or professional 
licenses to operate. The EU Services Directive mandated that Member States must make easily accessible through the 
 " Points of Single Contact "  for an individual or business in another member state to find out about the rules, 
regulations and formalities that apply to service activities and to complete the administrative procedures 
online. The PSCs are like a virtual one-stop shop, with national counters. In addition, it also requires 
creating a network among regulatory and supervisory authorities. Progress of the EU Points of Single Contact Source: Performance of the Points of Single Contact. Final report for DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs 2015 This was far more than an IT project to e-link national services. Establishing a regional system 
replicates all the difficulties of creating an integrated national one -financial, political, legal, technical 
inter-operability and basic communication and co-ordination challenges -with the addition of sovereignty, 
language and cultural barriers. Clear institutional arrangements are needed, such as a steering committee 
with technical working groups to discuss harmonisation of relevant policy and data exchange. In addition, 
many member states did not have one-stop shops at the outset or not with anything like this scope. After a 
decade, fewer than 40% of the requirements are yet in place. In the EU, the process of establishing the PSCs has gone alongside and in some cases driven 
permitting and licensing reforms. The stages are similar, although there are different stakeholders and more 
powerful incumbents to manage. The potential benefits are often huge but the scale of the task is also large, 
with numerous competent authorities and enforcement agencies to work with. 22 ASEAN Services Integration Report 2016 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% License for food distribution License to provide accomodation Licencse for plumbing, heating or… License to serve alcohol Approval of hygiene/sanitary… Approval safety compliance Registration on a sector-specific register Social security registration Application for VAT number Application for Tax ID/number Business registration Points of Single Contact (EU28+) Detailed requirements and contact details included in PSC 40 Challenges and policy recommendations for ASEAN One quarter of trade in ASEAN in 2015 was between member states 23 . Intra-ASEAN M&A activities 
continued to rise in 2016, suggesting an increase in intraregional corporate activities and regional 
expansion of investment by ASEAN companies. In most ASEAN Member States, intra-ASEAN 
investment is a major source of FDI. It should be noted that regulatory barriers can be used as a way to protect weaker economies. For 
instance, when creating the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), the ASEAN-6 committed to eliminate most 
tariff lines by 1 January 2010. Newer members, namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Viet Nam, were 
given longer to implement their commitments, generally 1 January 2015 with some more sensitive items 
planned for 1 January 2018. This was to give less developed states time to strengthen their domestic 
economies before full exposure to competition. However, there is some evidence than foreign FDI crowds 
out domestic firm creation and the prevailing view is that countries lose more than they gain. Registration of companies is a target area in the ASEAN e-Government Strategic Plan 2020. To 
achieve this, ASEAN is considering the benefits of harmonization of information requirements for the 
establishment of companies and the creation of an official company register accessible by all Member 
States. ASEAN already has experience of managing the institutional arrangements needed to facilitate 
regulatory co-operation and single points of regional information access, through mechanisms to increase 
the efficiency and competitiveness of inter-regional trade. It is clear that the different member states' 
current capacity to negotiate and implement such arrangements varies widely and prioritisation and 
sequencing is important. POLICY RECOMMENDATION 5: Define objectives and targets for business registration in ASEAN 5.1 Supporting development of national systems of business registration. A first step for a positive 
regional business environment should be to support the improvement of national systems. ASEAN 
members could set targets, recognising the current context in each ASEAN member state. Targets could 
include the minimum time taken to register a business (as in the Ease of Doing Business report), cost and 
the number of return visits needed to the One Stop Shop. ASEAN could consider extending this exercise to 
cover aspects of local registration and licensing. This could be achieved, for instance, by assessing the full 
start-up process for key example types of business, such as a restaurant or small manufacturing facility. 5.2 Encouraging intra-ASEAN investment. If encouraging ASEAN citizens and enterprises to 
invest in other member states by setting up businesses is a significant objective, then there should be one-
stop shop targets about cross-border accessibility and language and associated legal decisions about 
acceptability of certified translations, foreign bank accounts etc. This requires regulatory co-operation. 
This would progress alongside work on cross-border tariffs and taxation. 5.3 Regional data sharing. This needs clarity of objectives, such as supporting economic 
development, reducing fraud and money laundering or reducing risks for business. It would require a 
degree of regulatory co-ordination, about thresholds of registration, information gathered and legislation to 
make it accessible. Institutional arrangements such as technical working groups would be needed to review 
requirements and propose actions. 5.4 Agree on standard entries for business registers. Given the varying pace of development across 
the ASEAN countries, one way to build convergence towards a harmonised or unified business register is 23 http://asean.org/?static_post=external-trade-statistics-3 41 to consider and agree on standard entries for business registers e.g. the information that would need to be 
included in forms. This would further encourage regional data sharing that is consistent and can be 
comparable across ASEAN countries. 5.5 Build a common platform for company or enterprise names. In parallel to improving national 
databases to ease name-checking process for companies and enterprises, further progress toward data 
sharing can be achieved through the creation of a common platform for company or enterprise names. 5.6 Integrated network for business start-ups. This could be a longer-term objective but the 
European experience is that achieving national one-stop shops including all national and local registration, 
permit and licensing requirements is extremely difficult to achieve. Making these accessible to cross-
border users has received even less attention even across the EU. Even the relatively self-contained, 
technologically enabled and business-like world of business registration finds this difficult and in the 
ASEAN context, some member states do not yet have the capacity or infrastructure to put a national 
system in place. POLICY RECOMMENDATION 6: Share skills across ASEAN 6.1 Sharing IT system development skills for government. While national requirements and 
challenges are different, technical skills in implementing IT projects are transferable and member states 
could support each other in implementing and integrating systems. Regional technical and inter-operability 
standards could be developed for new systems, setting the groundwork for further integration in due 
course.
