and productivity and eventually involve country reviews to identify policies that help to improve both, 
job quality and productivity. The activity will build on two earlier work streams of the OECD, the Job Quality 
Framework and the Mental Health and Work review. The authors would like to thank Luke Haywood and

Mark Pearson for general comments. The authors are responsible for any remaining shortcomings. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 4 ABSTRACT Many countries invest considerable resources into promoting employment and the creation of jobs. At 
the same time, policies and institutions still pay relatively little attention to the quality of jobs although job 
quality has been found to be a major driver of employee wellbeing and may be an important factor for work 
productivity. Eventually, job quality might also influence labour supply choices and lead to higher 
employment. Providing robust evidence for the relationship between job quality and worker productivity 
could make a strong case for labour market policies directed at the improvement of job quality. This paper 
reviews existing evidence on the relationship between the quality of the work environment and individual 
at-work productivity, defined as reduced productivity while at work, and assesses the effect of health on 
this relationship. After screening 2 319 studies from various fields and disciplines, including economics and medicine, 
48 studies are reviewed. Strong evidence is found for a negative relationship between job stress or job strain 
and individual at-work productivity and for a positive relationship between job rewards and productivity. 
Moderate evidence is found for a negative relationship between work-family conflict and at-work 
productivity and for a positive relationship between fairness at work and social support from co-workers 
and productivity. Health influences the relationship between the quality of the work environment and 
productivity. Specifically, the relationship is stronger for people in good health. Job quality needs a more prominent place in labour market policy. More attention needs to be paid to 
workers' perceptions of the quality of their work environment and how policies and practices at both the 
level of the worker and the work environment may influence this. Furthermore, as health-related factors 
significantly influence the relationship between job quality and productivity, multidisciplinary approaches 
are needed to support at-work productivity. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 5 RÉSUMÉ De nombreux pays investissent des ressources considérables dans la promotion de l'emploi et la 
création d'emplois. Les politiques et les institutions continuent en même temps à accorder relativement peu 
d'attention à la qualité des emplois, bien que celle-ci soit un facteur majeur du bien-être des employés et 
peut-être un facteur important pour la productivité du travail. La qualité de l'emploi pourrait finalement 
influencer également les choix d'offre de main-d'oeuvre et conduire à un emploi supérieur. Fournir des 
preuves solides sur la relation entre la qualité de l'emploi et la productivité des travailleurs pourrait 
constituer un argument de taille dans les politiques du marché du travail visant à améliorer la qualité de 
l'emploi. Cet article examine les résultats existants sur la relation entre la qualité de l'environnement 
professionnel et la productivité individuelle au travail, définie comme une productivité réduite et évalue 
l'effet de la santé sur cette relation. Après avoir examiné 2 319 études dans divers domaines et disciplines, y compris l'économie et la 
médecine, 48 d'entre elles ont été reconsidérées. Des preuves solides ont ainsi pu mettre en évidence une 
relation négative entre stress ou tension au travail et productivité individuelle au travail, ainsi qu'une 
relation positive entre récompenses professionnelles et productivité. Un résultat modéré est mis en évidence 
dans le cas d'une relation négative entre conflit familiale et productivité au travail et dans le cas d'une 
relation positive entre équité au travail et soutien social des collègues et productivité. La santé influence la 
relation entre la qualité de l'environnement de professionnel et la productivité. Plus précisément, la relation 
est plus forte pour les personnes en bonne santé. La qualité de l'emploi nécessite une place plus importante dans les politiques du marché du travail. 
Il est nécessaire d'accorder plus d'attention à la perception qu'ont les travailleurs de la qualité de leur 
environnement professionnel et à la manière dont les politiques et pratiques, tant au niveau du travailleur 
que de son environnement, peuvent influencer cette situation. De plus, du fait que les facteurs liés à la santé 
influent de manière significative la relation entre qualité de l'emploi et productivité, des approches 
multidisciplinaires sont nécessaires pour soutenir la productivité au travail.

which lead to the development of the OECD Job Quality Framework and ii) the work on Mental Health and 
Work which culminated in the release of the Recommendation of the OECD Council on Integrated Mental 
Health, Skills and Work Policy. The OECD Job Quality Framework has underlined the importance of giving more prominence in 
policy and practice to the quality of the jobs created in a country to promote job-rich economic 
growth (Cazes, Hijzen and Saint-Martin, 2015). While countries are more focused on promoting the 
quantity of jobs and labour force participation, the quality of a job has been found to be a major driver of 
employee wellbeing and may be an important factor for sustainable work participation and work 
productivity (Catalina-Romero et al., 2015; Milner, Butterworth, Bentley, Kavanagh 
and LaMontagne, 2015; Stansfeld and Candy, 2006). Following this, the OECD Job Quality Framework has provided a yardstick for assessing job quality, 
which allows comparisons over time and across countries and socio-demographic groups. In the 
Framework, job quality is assessed along three dimensions: earnings quality, labour market security and 
quality of the work environment. There is ample evidence that these dimensions contribute to employee 
wellbeing (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2013; Green, 2011; Salvatori, 2010). While employee wellbeing is an end in its own right, the OECD Job Quality Framework emphasises 
the importance of assessing the impact of job quality on work productivity to provide further justification 
for incorporating job quality in policy recommendations on labour market performance. Whereas the 
dimensions of earnings quality and labour market security are quantitative in nature and can be more easily 
related to work productivity and compared across contexts, the dimension of the quality of the work 
environment captures many qualitative aspects of employment that are less easily translated in terms of 
work productivity and less comparable. The first goal of this paper is to review existing evidence on the relationship between the quality of 
the work environment and work productivity. While productivity is a multidimensional construct and can 
be operationalized in different ways – e.g. through annual working hours or output per hour worked or the 
number of sick-leave days –, we chose to specifically focus on at-work productivity loss which refers to a 
worker's reduced productivity, or performance, while at work. Through the OECD Mental Health and Work review (OECD, 2012; OECD, 2015) it has become 
evident that participating in work and being productive at work is far more challenging for people with 
health problems compared to their peers without health problems, and even more so for people with mental 
health problems. For example, 70% of people with mild-to-moderate mental health problems report to have 
experienced reduced at-work productivity or performance compared to 30% of their peers without mental 
health problems (OECD, 2012). An important question arising is whether and in what way the relationship 
between the quality of the work environment and individual at-work productivity is influenced by health. 
The relationship may differ depending on the workers' health status or, workers' health could explain the 
relationship between the quality of the work environment and at-work productivity (in other words, a poor 
work environment may lead to reduced health which in turn may reduce the worker's productivity). 
A second goal of this paper is to assess the existing evidence on the effect of health on the relationship 
between the quality of the work environment and at-work productivity. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 9 DEFINITIONS The quality of the work environment, individual at-work productivity and also health can be measured 
and construed in a number of ways. It is not assumed that the particular definitions used in this paper are 
superior to alternative definitions, but it is important to be aware of the choice made to ensure clarity about 
the focus of this paper, and its findings. At-work productivity In the field of Work and Health, at-work productivity is often seen as one particular aspect of overall 
work productivity, in addition to absenteeism and work disability. Often, the focus is on assessing at-work 
productivity loss due to health problems. Examples of definitions of at-work productivity loss used in the 
literature include 'the inability to adequately perform one's work due to health problems,' 'having gone to 
work while hindered by health problems,' or 'perceiving difficulties in meeting work demands given one's 
(physical or mental) health.' In this strand of literature, at-work productivity is usually assessed from the 
perspective of the individual worker. Different from that, the organisational psychology, human resource and business literature more 
frequently interpret at-work productivity as performance at work, with no specific connection to people's 
health status. Performance could be interpreted as an assessment of overall performance (or productivity), 
but often it is also further divided into, for example, in-role performance, extra-role performance, task 
performance, and others. While assessments by the individual worker are most common, in this field, 
supervisor ratings or team performance ratings are also used. For this paper, the decision was made to define at-work productivity as either: 1. 
An assessment of the percentage of time or number of days one has (or has not) been productive 
or functioning well while at work, which could include a specific connection to health 
(i.e. problems with reduced productivity/functioning due to health problems); or 2. 
An overall assessment of one's performance or productivity while at work. This particular choice has two major limitations, or implications. First, the focus in this paper is on a 
subjective assessment by the individual worker which may be quite remote from the  " economic concept "  of 
productivity because workers have no ways of observing firm's value added. Secondly, absenteeism is not 
included in this definition, i.e. the study only looks at performance or productivity of workers while at 
work. In other words, the paper is looking at productivity per hour of work whereas, by narrowing the 
analysis in this way, it omits any possible effects that a bad quality of the work environment might have on 
lowering productivity per worker for a given level of hourly productivity (by increasing sick leave and 
other absences from work). This effect could potentially be as large as the one considered in the paper. Quality of the work environment Two dominant theories on the quality of the work environment are the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) 
and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) models (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007; Siegrist, 1996). The ERI 
model postulates reciprocity between effort, consisting of extrinsic job demands and intrinsic motivation to 
meet these demands, and rewards, consisting of salary, esteem, security and career opportunities. It is 
hypothesised that an imbalance between effort and rewards results in reduced worker wellbeing. The JD-R 
model theorises an interaction between job demands and job resources, where job demands refer to physical, 
psychological, social or organisational aspects that request effort or skills and job resources refer to physical, 
psychological, social or organisational aspects that help in achieving goals, reduce job demands and/or 
stimulate personal growth (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007). According to the JD-R model, job demands can DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 10 lead to reduced wellbeing and job resources to improved motivation. Adequate job resources may buffer the 
negative relationship between job demands and wellbeing. This implies that (additional) job demands are 
more problematic for workers if they do not have the job resources to cope with these demands. Similarly, 
(additional) job demands may reduce the positive relationship between job resources and motivation. The 
effort and reward concepts are also included in the JD-R model (as being part of demands and resources, 
respectively), but the specific trade-off hypothesis is not postulated in the JD-R model. Many empirical studies have tried to validate the JD-R and ERI models, and there is evidence showing 
that the mechanisms described in these models are indeed related to worker wellbeing and motivation (e.g. 
burn-out and organisational commitment). Additionally, there is evidence for a relationship with 
absenteeism (Arnold B. Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Catalina-Romero et al., 2015; Milner et al., 2015). 
However, less is known about studies that have looked at the balance of job demands and job resources and 
at-work productivity. Lagerveld et al. (2010) reviewed studies on the association between work factors and 
work functioning (which they defined as the productivity or performance of employees at work) and found 
only one factor to be associated, namely the type of occupation. However, this finding was based on only 
one study which was also cross-sectional in design. A more recent review by Miraglia and Johns (2016) 
combined correlations found in different studies between work factors and presenteeism (defined as 
 " attending work when ill " ). This meta-analysis of correlations identified multiple work factors as strongly 
correlated to presenteeism, including: role demands, workload, understaffing, working hours and physical 
demands. However, the review only focused on presenteeism as an outcome, while at-work productivity 
can be assessed in various other ways (for instance, an assessment of work performance or work 
functioning). An overview of study results on the relationship between the quality of the work environment 
and at-work productivity (as assessed in different ways) would add to the current literature. In the OECD Job Quality Framework, quality of the work environment is defined largely along the 
lines of the JD-R model. The OECD job strain index takes several components and dimensions of the 
quality of the work environment into account, to identify the extent to which job demands exceed 
job resources. There is no consensus on a minimal set of ingredients to measure the quality of the work 
environment and, therefore, a minimal set of questions to be included in surveys that aim to examine 
the quality of the work environment. The forthcoming OECD Guidelines on Measuring Quality of 
the Working Environment will address conceptualisation and measurement issues. In this paper, quality of the work environment is defined in the broader JD-R way of physical, 
psychological, social or organisational job demands and job resources. This includes psychosocial work 
factors such as psychological job demands, autonomy/job control, social support or job rewards, as well as 
more contextual work factors like organisational size, type of contract or job type. Notably, the paper is 
based on what factors and dimensions the studies reviewed have considered. Moreover, the terms quality of 
the work environment and work factors (which are seen as an operationalization of the quality of the work 
environment) are used interchangeably. Health Since 1948, the World Health Organisation defines health as  " a state of complete physical, mental and 
social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity " . This definition has been criticised in 
the past decades, especially for using the word 'complete' with respect to wellbeing. Probably, the 
requirement of complete health would render the majority of the population unhealthy. Recently, Huber and 
colleagues redefined health to a more dynamic concept of 'the ability to adapt and to self-manage, in the 
face of social, mental and physical challenges in life' (Huber et al., 2011). With this concept of health, 
people with physical, mental or social challenges who are able and enabled to cope well with these 
challenges are regarded as healthy. This positive and dynamic concept of health is still underused in 
research, where health is often assessed through the absence or presence of physical and/or mental health DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 11 problems, symptoms or disabilities. As this paper reviews the existing research literature, it defines health 
in line with the common approach i.e. the presence or absence of physical and/or mental health problems, 
symptoms or disabilities. METHODS Literature search Scientific articles were searched in the following medical, psychological and economic literature 
databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, Business Source Elite and Web of Science. The search strategy consisted of 
search terms related to at-work productivity loss (e.g. presenteeism, job performance, work functioning) 
combined with terms related to work factors (e.g. work conditions, work stressors, psychosocial factors). 
No search terms on health were included as the primary goal was to identify research on the relationship 
between quality of the work environment and at-work productivity, regardless of the effect of health on this 
relationship. Including search terms related to health would restrict the number of studies that would be 
identified. Also, no restrictions were used on study type or year of publication, and the search included 
articles up until April 2016. The search string for each database can be found in the appendix. Additional 
articles were searched through scanning the reference list of included studies. Inclusion of studies One author (IA) screened all titles and abstracts of articles that were found through the literature 
search. In case of uncertainty of including or excluding an article the full text was retrieved, and if that 
would not solve the uncertainty discussion took place with a second author (CP or FA). Inclusion criteria 
for studies were: (1) empirical, quantitative data were presented on the relationship between work factors 
and at-work productivity; (2) at-work productivity was quantitatively assessed at the individual level by 
requesting (a) the percentage of time/number of days a worker has (not) been productive/functioning well at 
work or (b) a worker's overall rating of his/her own performance/productivity/functioning at work; (3) the 
included work factors had to represent the psychosocial quality of the work environment and could be 
either (a) objective characteristics (e.g. contract hours, manual/non-manual work) or (b) psychosocial 
characteristics (e.g. job demands, resources, workplace bullying); (4) the article should be written in 
English, Dutch or German; and (5) the study should take place in a real-life workplace setting, e.g. not in a 
simulated/laboratory setting. Articles using measures of work ability or specific aspects of job performance 
(e.g. in-role, extra-role, task or contextual performance) were excluded, as these do not provide an 
indication of the amount of time a worker is (not) functioning/being productive at work or an overall 
performance score. Furthermore, reviews were excluded, but their reference lists were checked for 
potentially relevant studies. Data extraction One author (IA) extracted data from the included studies on study type (cross-sectional, longitudinal), 
study year, country, study goal, population type, population size, response rate, exposure variables 
included, covariates controlled for, outcome variable, statistical method and study outcome (i.e. significant 
relationships between work factors and at-work productivity in final models). Data synthesis In order to ensure a degree of homogeneity, additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
formulated. Studies were only included if the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity 
was investigated through multivariable analyses including more than one work factor and at least two 
confounders, age and gender. Furthermore, the cut-off for significance in the multivariable model had to be 
set at P<.05. In case results were only presented for subgroups (e.g. age groups, occupational type) and DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 12 different outcomes were found across the subgroups, the study was excluded. Similarly, studies were 
excluded when multiple, different instruments for assessing at-work productivity were used, or when only 
scores on subscales of an instrument were reported. Finally, when different work factors were grouped 
together to present a single factor, the study was also excluded. Effect coefficients (e.g. betas, risk ratios, odds ratios) of the relationship between work factors and at-
work productivity were extracted from the final multivariable models (i.e. including all work factors and 
confounders analysed in the study). No meta-analyses were performed because of the high degree of 
heterogeneity between studies (e.g. different measures used for assessing work factors and at-work 
productivity). Instead, the findings were summarised by (a) the number of times similar work factors were 
assessed in different studies; (b) the number of times a statistically significant relationship with at-work 
productivity was found at α<.05; and (c) the direction of the relationship that was found. Comparable work 
factors had to be assessed in at least three studies to be included in the quantitative synthesis. Moderate 
evidence for a work factor was defined as 50-74% of the studies finding a significant effect in the same 
direction, and strong evidence was defined as at least 75% of the studies finding a significant effect in the 
same direction. In these definitions of moderate and strong evidence, no difference was made between 
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. However, results from longitudinal studies are described separately 
in this paper for work factors for which strong or moderate evidence was found, and in case a longitudinal 
study had found a significant relationship even though there was no strong or moderate evidence based on 
the combination of studies. This was done as only longitudinal studies are able to provide insight into the 
direction of relationships. The second goal of the paper is to summarise the effect of health on the relationship between work 
factors and at-work productivity. Therefore, data were abstracted from studies that looked at health in one 
of three ways: (a) as mediator of the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity; (b) as 
confounder of the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity; or (c) as moderator of the 
relationship between work factors and at-work productivity. For the studies looking at mediation, 
information was abstracted on the significant mediation paths that were found between work factors, health 
and at-work productivity. For studies on confounding, the effect coefficients were compared of (a) the 
relationship between a work factor and at-work productivity controlling for all other included work factors 
and confounders except health; and (b) the relationship between a work factor and at-work productivity 
controlling for all other included work factors and confounders including health. In case no information was 
available on the separate confounding effect of health, authors were contacted to request this additional 
information. For studies on moderation, information was abstracted on the difference in the relationship 
between work factors and at-work productivity for people in good and bad health. RESULTS Results of the search Figure 1 presents a flow diagram of included and excluded studies. The initial search in the databases 
resulted in 3 140 references and 21 studies were identified through reference checking of included studies. 
After removing duplicate references, 2 319 references remained. Based on title and abstract screening, 
2 249 studies were excluded, mostly because studies did not assess at-work productivity following the 
inclusion criterion described above. Full-text reading of the 70 remaining studies resulted in a further 
exclusion of 22 articles. Reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure 1. Thus, finally, 48 studies were 
included in this paper. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 13 Characteristics of included studies The main characteristics of the studies included in the analysis are summarised in Table 1. The 
majority of the studies (79%) were published between 2010 and 2016 and conducted in various countries; 
e.g. the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Korea and several European countries. The number of participants 
included in a study varied greatly, with the smallest study containing only 68 participants and the largest 
study as many as 78 587 participants. Overall, 62% of the studies had more than 1 000 participants. In the 
majority of studies, participants were recruited through one or several companies. Three studies used a 
European survey and 13 studies recruited participants through national surveys or selected a nationally 
representative sample. In eight studies, participants with a specific health problem were recruited; in three 
studies this related to mental health problems and in five studies to physical health problems. Table 1 also provides information on several methodological aspects of the included studies. Most 
studies (77%) had a cross-sectional as opposed to a longitudinal design, which implies that drawing 
conclusions on the direction of the relationship (i.e. the causality) between work factors and individual 
at-work productivity remains difficult. Furthermore, 66% of the studies included four important 
confounders, i.e. age, gender, health (either physical or mental) and educational level/skill level. Of the 31 
studies (66% of all included studies) that reported the response rate, 35% had a response rate below 50%. 
Finally, the large majority of the studies (85%) had sufficient power for the analyses that were conducted. Instruments to assess at-work productivity varied across studies. About half of the studies used one 
self-report question on the number of days (mostly within a timeframe of 12 months) one had been at work 
despite health problems, which is often referred to as  " presenteeism " . Six studies assessed the percentage of 
time people experienced difficulties with executing their work tasks due to health problems measured 
through either the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire or the Work Limitations Questionnaire. There 
were nine studies that assessed self-rated performance or productivity at work. Opposed to all other studies, 
in these nine studies, no specific reference was made to the effect of health on at-work productivity. Table 2 
provides an overview of the different instruments to assess at-work productivity that were used, and 
whether instruments specifically referred to health-related at-work productivity. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 14 Figure 1.

demands given one's physical health or emotional problems. The total score ranges between 0-100 
with higher scores indicating better work functioning. Yes Boonen 2015 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire assessing the extent to which health 
affected productivity at work on a scale of 0-10. 
Yes Bubonya 2016 Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) assessing whether, as a result of any emotional problems, one has 
experienced any of the following:  " cutting down the amount of time spent on your work or other 
activities " ;  " accomplished less than you would like " ; and  " didn't do work or other activities as carefully 
as usual " .  " Yes "  to any of the questions is recorded as presenteeism. Yes One question on the number of days one has gone to work despite illness/injury/health problems. E.g.:  " Over the past 12 months did you work when you were sick? "   " Has it happened over the previous 12 months that you have gone to work despite feeling that you 
really should have taken sick leave because of your state of health? "  
 " During the past 12 months, have you gone to work despite feeling that you should have taken sick 
leave? "  Cocker 2011

No de Vries 2015; Kennedy 2014 Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) assessing the impact of health problems on at-work 
performance and productivity. An overall productivity score is calculated, which expresses the 
percentage loss in productivity associated with health problems. Yes McTernan 2013 Presenteeism was assessed using a question from the HPQ: what is one's overall job performance on 
a scale from 0 (worst performance anyone could have) to 10 (performance of a top worker). First, 
performance loss was calculated by deducting this performance score from the maximum score (10). 
Then, by deducting the mean performance loss scores of participants who reported no depression from 
the participants who reported depression, a percentage increase in scores of performance loss that 
was related to depression was derived as an indicator of presenteeism. Yes Merril 2012 Twelve selected questions from the HPQ and WPAI. The stem of the question read, ''During the past 
four weeks (28 days), how often have you been at work but had trouble concentrating or doing your 
best because of…'' The 12 extensions to the question were (1) your health or physical condition, (2) 
your responsibilities taking care of someone else, (3) lack of resources (people, material, or 
information), (4) issues with coworkers, (5) having too much to do and not enough time, (6) issues with 
supervisor(s), (7) lack of sufficient training, (8) personal problems or worries, (9) depression or anxiety, 
(10) regulatory or legal requirements, (11) technology issues, or (12) financial stress/concerns. An 
overall 100-point presenteeism index score is calculated. Yes Five presenteeism questions as follows: In the past 4 weeks how much time did your stress levels, 
physical or emotional health make it difficult for you to do the following: (1) Work your required number 
of hours; (2) Use your equipment properly (e.g., keyboard, mouse, tools, or machinery); (3) 
Concentrate on your work; (4) Work effectively with others; (5) Work to the best of your ability. 
A summary presenteeism score is calculated on a scale of 0% (no impairment) to 100% (completely 
impaired). Health and Labour Questionnaire Short Form (SF-HLQ), scoring the number of days one has been 
working while hindered by health problems and how efficient one has been working on these days on a 
score from 0-1. Work performance was computed by the formula: # days hindered x (1-efficiency) x # work hours per day / # work hours per week , in which higher rates 
indicate more impairment. Alavinia 2009; Geuskens 2008; van den 
Berg 2011 Quantity question of the Quantity and Quality Instrument assessing how much work one has actually 
performed during regular hours on the most recent regular workday relative to a normal workday on 
scale from 0 (nothing) to 10 (normal quantity). No Wang 2010 6-item Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS-6) assessing one's ability to concentrate and accomplish

Yes DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 17 Relationship between quality of the work environment and at-work productivity Table 3 summarises the relationships that were identified in the included studies between work factors 
and at-work productivity. Strong evidence 1 was found for a negative relationship between job stress and job 
strain and at-work productivity and for a positive relationship between job rewards and productivity. 
Moderate evidence 2 was found for a negative relationship between work-family conflict and at-work 
productivity and for a positive relationship between fairness at work and social support from co-workers 
and productivity. Table 3 shows for each work factor the number of studies that had a longitudinal design and whether 
these studies found a significant relationship between the work factor and individual at-work productivity: 
 For job strain, the only longitudinal study included in the analysis (study 16) showed that 
presenteeism in 2004 was not explained by job strain in 2002. 
 The only longitudinal study on fairness at work (study 40) found a significant effect with at-work 
productivity; participants scoring high on fairness (assessed as procedural justice) in 2009 and 
2010 had significantly higher job performance scores in 2010 compared to participants scoring 
low on fairness at both points in time. , 
 Two out of four longitudinal studies looking at 'social support from co-workers' found a 
significant relationship with at-work productivity. Low support from colleagues predicted reduced 
work performance at 6 and 12 months follow-up (study 23); and co-worker support in 2008 was 
positively related to job performance in 2009 (study 38). 
 For psychological job demands, only one out of five longitudinal studies included in the analysis 
found a significant relationship with productivity; according to this study (study 30), job demands 
at baseline increased the odds of presenteeism one year later and a change in job demands (from 
baseline to 1-year follow-up) led to increased odds for presenteeism over time (from 1-year to 2-
year follow-up). However, this study did not control for at-work productivity at baseline (the four 
studies that did not find an effect did control for this). 
 Similarly, of the six longitudinal studies that looked at the relationship between job control and at-
work productivity, four found no significant relationship between baseline job control and at-work 
productivity at 2, 3, 6 or 12-month follow-up (study 1, study 3, study 23 and study 28). Again, 
study 30 found a relationship (job control at baseline decreased the odds of presenteeism one year 
later and a change in job control decreased the odds of presenteeism over time) and this finding 
was confirmed by another study, which found that baseline job control predicted job performance 
one year later (study 38). For several work factors, different studies found results in the opposite direction. For example, for job 
rewards four studies found a positive association with productivity and one study a negative association. 
There might be obvious explanations for such seemingly conflicting findings. Positive work factors such as 
job rewards, job control and good leadership may on the one hand contribute to employee wellbeing and as 
such have a positive effect on productivity. On the other hand, a negative effect may be expected if people 
experience health or other problems that interfere with their productivity, but try to keep going out of 
loyalty for the good work conditions they experience. 1 Strong evidence was defined as ≥75% of the studies (that assessed the respective work factor) finding a significant 
effect in the same direction. 2 Moderate evidence was defined as 50-74% of the studies (that assessed the respective work factor) finding a 
significant effect in the same direction. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 18 Table 3. Summary of statistically significant relationships between work factors 
and at-work productivity loss a a) The table only includes results from studies in which multivariable regression analyses were performed (with controls). 
b) Only work factors that have been assessed in at least three different studies are reported. The ordering of the factors is based on

people to work harder to increase their chances of remaining in the organisation. Furthermore, in Table 3 
studies are combined that assess at-work productivity in different ways. About half of the studies assess at-
work productivity loss by requesting whether people had been at work while they should have stayed at 
home because of health problems. High physical job demands may make it impossible to do one's work and 
thus decrease the chances of turning up at work while experiencing health problems (i.e. this was classified 
as a positive relationship with at-work productivity). On the other hand, in studies where self-assessed 
performance was used as measure of at-work productivity, it would be more likely that physical demands 
would lead to a lower assessment of performance (i.e. this was classified as a negative relationship with at-
work productivity).This is exactly what was found in the studies that included physical demands (and found 
an effect) and thus explains the different direction of effects found for this work factor. For a few work factors, no or only limited evidence was found for the relationship with at-work 
productivity. This was especially for general job support and supervisor social support. This might seem 
surprising given that research has shown that the supervisor-worker relationship can impact workers' 
wellbeing (Nielsen and Daniels, 2016; O'Donnell, Berkman and Subramanian, 2012). Potentially, social 
support measures do not capture the most relevant aspects of the supervisor-worker relationship for 
productivity. For example, assessing whether a supervisor is overall 'concerned', 'helpful' or 'encouraging' 
(as examples of items typically used to measure the supervisor-worker relationship) might be too general to 
find a significant relationship with at-work productivity; it could be more informative to look in more detail at, 
for example, whether a supervisor can be approached to discuss potential productivity problems without the 
fear of being stigmatised and whether a supervisor is willing to change work conditions. The latter aspects are 
rarely included in supervisor support scales. Effect of health on the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity There are three different ways in which the effect of health on the relationship between work factors 
and at-work productivity are assessed (see Table 4):  First, five studies analysed whether the relationship between work factors and productivity was 
explained by health, i.e. whether work factors are related to a decrease or increase in health which 
in turn decreases or increases at-work productivity (also referred to as a mediation effect).For 
example, low job control may deteriorate a worker's health, and that effect on health may, in turn, 
reduce at-work productivity.  Second, eight studies provided information on whether the relationship between work factors and 
productivity weakened or disappeared when controlling for the effect of health (i.e. taking health 
as a confounder into account in the analysis). For example, a relationship between job strain and 
at-work productivity might be (partly) due to the fact that people with job strain have poorer 
health or that people with poor health experience higher job strain. While this seems similar to the 
above mentioned mediation analyses, there is one important difference. With mediation analysis a 
specific path is evaluated (in the six studies included it was the path: work factors influence health 
and health influences productivity), while with confounding it is not investigated in what way 
health 'interferes' in the relationship, but only whether it does. In five studies, results on the 
confounding effect of health were already included while in three cases the study authors 
provided additional information to the authors of the present paper on results after controlling for 
health (study number 19, 24 and 26). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 20  Third, there were two studies that investigated whether the effect of work factors on productivity 
was different for people in good or bad health, often referred to as moderation analysis (in some 
disciplines the terms interaction or effect-modification are more common). Specifically, studies 
analysed the relationship between work factors and individual productivity separately for people 
with bad and with good health. This allows identifying whether poor outcomes on work factors 
are disadvantageous with regards to productivity to both people in bad and people in good health 
or only to one of these groups. Table 4. 
Assessment of health in studies on mediation, confounding and moderation Results of the mediation, confounding and moderation analyses are presented in Table 5. Due to the 
limited number of studies, it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions for each individual work factor. For 
most work factors, only one study was available. However, for job rewards, work-family imbalance and 
workload two studies evaluated the mediation effect of health and both found an effect in the same 
direction: poor work conditions are related to poorer health which in turn is related to decreased 
productivity while at work, while good work conditions are related to good health which in turn leads to 
increased productivity. Only for job strain and workplace bullying, a longitudinal study was found that 
showed a significant mediation effect by health (study 34). This study found that baseline job strain and 
workplace bullying were related to reduced job performance at one-year follow-up through increased 
depression symptoms (from baseline to one-year follow-up): i.e. job strain and bullying resulted in 
increased depression symptoms which in turn resulted in reduced job performance. Study

relationship with productivity became stronger (e.g. effort, firm size, supervisory role, non-standard work 
time, working hours) or lost significance completely (e.g. conflict and lack of recognition, cooperation with 
colleagues, job strain, job support, workload). Table 5.

e) This also includes collaboration with supervisor. The two studies that assessed the moderating effect of health on the relationship between work factors 
and at-work productivity show consistent results. For all work factors included in the two studies, the effect 
of the work factor on productivity (be it positive or negative) was stronger for people in good health. Thus, 
for example, increased job control was associated with a reduced risk of productivity loss, but this mattered 
especially (study 33) or only (study 8) for people in good health. Taking the latter finding into account, it could be expected that studies focusing on study populations 
with specific health problems are less likely to find a relationship between work factors and at-work 
productivity which in turn could have implications for the overall findings presented in this paper. Of the 43 
studies that provided the evidence for Table 3 eight studies included a study population with health 
problems (see also Table 1). Three of the eight studies found no relationship between any of the included 
work factors and productivity (study 11, study 14 and study 31). The other five studies found an effect for 
only one or two out of the six to twelve work factors included. DISCUSSION This paper investigated the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity loss and the 
effect of health on this relationship by reviewing research that has been conducted on this topic. Three 
findings stand out: 1. 
There is a great diversity in the operationalization of at-work productivity loss; 2. 
For several work factors there is emergent evidence of a strongly or moderately positive 
relationship with productivity; and 3. 
Health is a relevant factor to take into account when looking at the relationship between work 
factors and productivity. Work factors No. of studies that

varying operationalisations. 'At-work productivity' was defined as either (a) the amount of time a worker 
was productive or able to function/perform well at work, or (b) the worker's rating of his/her own 
performance/productivity/functioning at work. Among the 48 included studies, there were 14 different ways 
in which at-work productivity (loss) was operationalized. This raises the question whether consensus is 
needed on defining and assessing this outcome, especially when the aim is to design policies and identify 
practices that influence worker productivity. The majority of productivity instruments used in the studies tried to identify reduced at-work 
productivity due to health problems specifically. Most frequently used was a single-item question on the 
number of days one had gone to work despite health problems. Conceptually, there are two problems with 
this single-item question when trying to capture at-work productivity. First, it implies that working while 
experiencing health problems will result in productivity loss, or in other words that ill-health equals 
inability to work. However, not all people experiencing health problems are unable to function or be 
productive at work. As such, an item on working despite health problems could result in an overestimation 
of productivity loss as going to work while experiencing health problems does not necessarily reduce 
productivity. Second, the item implies that when one experiences ill-health, one should not go to work. In 
several studies the item even included statements such as 'while you should have stayed at home'. This 
goes against scientific evidence that work is generally good for health (Dooley, Fielding and Levi, 1996; 
Thomas, Benzeval and Stansfeld, 2005), and that it can be an important factor in a person's recovery 
(OECD, 2012). Furthermore, many people with health problems emphasise that participating in work is 
important to them (Saunders and Nedelec, 2014). Instead of asking people how many days they were at 
work despite of health problems, an operationalization such as the one used in study 43 by Plaisier et al. 
(2012), would be preferable. Here it was asked how many working days a respondent experienced 
hindrance by health problems, followed by an assessment of the person's efficiency on these days. 
Similarly, questionnaires like the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire and Work Limitations 
Questionnaire result in an overall score representing the percentage of time one was not able to function 
well at work specifically due to health problems (according to the respondent). Such multiple-item 
questionnaires provide more detailed information on specific tasks for which people experienced work 
functioning problems and can provide more direction for interventions by occupational health providers or 
employment counsellors. About one-third of the studies used a single-item instrument inquiring a worker's overall performance 
or productivity at work, mostly on a scale from 0 to 10, regardless of health problems. These instruments 
provide a straightforward assessment of one's self-perceived performance or productivity at work but no 
information on what the specific productivity problems are and where interventions could focus on. The use of different operationalisations and instruments to assess at-work productivity may influence the 
relationships one finds between work factors and at-work productivity. In this regard, a study by Johns (2011) 
which included different instruments to assess at-work productivity loss – a single item on presenteeism days 
but also the multiple-item Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and the Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS) 
– has provided interesting insights. While relationships between the work factors and the different outcome 
measures were in the same direction, differences were found in their strength and statistical significance; for 
instance, 'pay equity' was significantly associated with the single item on presenteeism days but not with the 
WLQ and SPS, while 'family and work conflict' was significantly related to the WLQ and SPS but not to the 
presenteeism item. Based on this one paper, however, it is difficult to provide strong explanations for these 
different results, highlighting the need for more research to look into this. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 24 To conclude, when choosing an instrument to assess at-work productivity, it is important to take into 
account what the goal of the analysis is. For example, when assessing how productive people are at work, a 
single question about the number of days someone went to work despite health problems is not useful as it 
does not provide information on whether the person was productive. Including an assessment of whether 
one was also hindered by health problems and an estimation of the amount of hindrance would be essential. 
When the goal is to measure how to influence productivity, multiple-item measures identifying which types 
of work tasks are most problematic would be more informative. Consensus about the use of one particular 
instrument is not essential, but using the same instrument when having a similar goal would improve 
comparability across settings. Quality of the work environment influences at-work productivity A first conclusion that can be drawn from the largely cross-sectional studies reviewed in this paper is that 
several work factors have shown to be related to productivity. There was strong evidence for a relationship 
with job stress, job rewards and job strain and moderate evidence for a relationship with work-family conflict, 
fairness at work and social support from co-workers. The limited number of longitudinal studies and the 
differing results of these studies (i.e. some did and others did not find a longitudinal relationship between a 
work factor and at-work productivity) did not allow clear conclusions on the causal pathways. As such, 
separate look at these longitudinal studies did not change the overall conclusion that there is evidence that 
several work factors are related to at-work productivity. Second, not for all work factors that have been 
theoretically linked with worker productivity, following the dominant Job Demands Resources (JD-R) and 
Effort Reward Imbalance (ERI) models, supportive evidence was found. For example, there was no clear 
evidence for a unique relationship between job demands or job control (an important job resource in the JD-R 
model) and at-work productivity, while this is being hypothesized in JD-R theory (Bakker and Demerouti, 
2016). However, in line with JD-R theory, job strain, i.e. the combination of high job demands and low job 
resources, did show a significant relationship with at-work productivity in several cross-sectional studies. 
Another finding is that for general job support and supervisor support, most studies did not find any 
relationship. This is surprising as qualitative studies (e.g. interviews with workers) have shown that the 
supervisor-worker relationship is important for workers' functioning at work, especially for people with health 
problems (Hjarsbech, Nielsen, Andersen, Rugulies and Christensen, 2015; Andersen, Nielsen and Brinkmann 
2012). The question arises whether other ways to assess this relationship are needed. While more longitudinal research is needed to confirm a causal pathway between the work factors 
reported in this paper and at-work productivity, an important implication for policy and practice is that 
more attention is needed for the quality of work and the inherent interplay between the individual and its 
work context. At this moment, country policies and worker support practices do not take this into account. 
First, in many OECD countries, workplace policies primarily focus on physical unsafe and unhealthy work 
conditions. The identification of psychosocial workplace risks from the perspective of the individual worker 
(e.g. fairness of organisational policies and job stain) is rarely included in workplace legislation and where 
it is, it generally plays a limited role in practice (OECD, 2015). However, this paper has shown that these 
factors matter for productivity. Furthermore, there is a body of evidence showing the importance of such 
factors for workers' health (Bakker and Demerouti, 2016) (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014). Second, while 
workplace policies are directed at the (physical) works environment, the available interventions for 
improving worker wellbeing and productivity are often (narrowly) focused on the individual worker, for 
example by trying to improve resilience, stress management or coping skills (Ebert et al., 2016; Jamieson 
and Tuckey, 2016). Here, the interaction between the worker and its work environment is missing as well. 
More attention is needed for how workers perceive the quality of their work environment and how policies 
and practices at both the level of the worker and the work environment may positively influence this. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 25 When drawing conclusions on the relationship between the quality of the work environment and 
productivity based on this paper, several limitations need to be taken into account. First, as mentioned, only 
11 studies had a longitudinal design, which inhibits conclusions on a causal relationship between work 
factors and at-work productivity. Also, the direction of causation sometimes remains unclear. For some 
work factors a reversed causal pathway could be hypothesised. For example, one could imagine that 
increased productivity may lead to increased job rewards just as well as increased job rewards could lead to 
increased productivity. Furthermore, the designs of the longitudinal studies that were included had some 
limitations. For example, most of these studies had quite a short follow-up period of one year. Also, 
baseline assessments of at-work productivity were not always included, but this is essential to investigate 
causal pathways between work factors and productivity. In a similar vein, work factors were often only 
assessed at baseline, while these factors should be repeatedly measured as the experience of quality of the 
work environment may fluctuate over time. Second, studies used different instruments to assess productivity and the various work factors, include 
different study populations and use different covariates in their analyses. This heterogeneity in studies 
reduces comparability and may explain why for some work factors different studies found opposite results. 
As discussed above, the study by Johns (2011) showed that relationships between work factors and at-work 
productivity varied for different measures of at-work productivity. Other studies found that the relationship 
between work factors and at-work productivity varies for different subgroups of participants, such as 
workers differing in tenure or type of occupation, or for different countries (Claes, 2011; Jourdain and 
Vézina, 2014; Jacobs et al. 2007). However, there were too few studies to derive meaningful conclusions 
when splitting results further for, e.g., similar at-work productivity measures. This is why for this paper it 
was chosen to combine the results of all studies and to evaluate whether some broad conclusions on the 
relevance of the quality of the work environment for at-work productivity could be drawn. Third, several 
work factors were investigated in only a few studies, including those for which strong evidence was found. 
It is important to have these work factors included in future research, to evaluate whether their relevance for 
at-work productivity also shows in other settings. Work policies need to include a health perspective All 14 studies that investigated the impact of health on the relationship between the quality of the work 
environment and productivity showed that health indeed matters. Policies must reflect that finding: policies 
aimed at improving the quality of the work environment so to improve worker productivity must also take 
workers' health into account. Especially interesting are the comparable findings of the two studies looking at the moderating effect 
of health on the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity. These studies show that the 
relationship between positive work factors (e.g. job control) or negative work factors (e.g. job stress) and 
productivity is strongest for people in good health. This is an important finding because it suggests that the 
quality of the work environment matters for reasons that go beyond its negative effects on workers' health. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 26 For some work factors, the relationship with productivity even ceases to exist for people in bad health. 
The lack of a relationship between the quality of the work environment and productivity for people in bad 
health has important implications for research and policy. If the relationship between work factors and 
productivity is solely investigated within study populations dealing with health problems, chances of finding 
significant associations may be smaller. Of the five studies included in this paper with study populations with 
health problems, three studies found no effect for any of the work factors. This could one lead to conclude that 
the quality of the work environment does not matter for productivity. But this would be incorrect, as studies in 
this paper for general populations show a connection between several work factors and productivity. 
Furthermore, research has shown that many people with health problems have difficulty in remaining 
productive at work (Aronsson, Gustafsson and Dallner, 2000; OECD, 2012). Thus, good work conditions 
alone seem insufficient for workers with health problems to ensure a productive working life. However, many of the studies included in this paper show that health-related factors (e.g. chronic diseases, 
general health, or mental distress) were also significantly related to at-work productivity, thereby confirming the 
need for multidisciplinary approaches to support worker productivity. In line with this, work by the OECD on 
Mental Health and Work has shown that workplace policies for people with mental health problems should not 
only focus on improving the psychosocial quality of work, but also have a focus on keeping people in work and 
helping them return to work quickly when they are ill. For both of these aims, integrated health and work support 
is critical (OECD, 2015). Neither can underlying health issues remain unaddressed, nor can health professionals 
ignore the underlying workplace issues. An adequate policy response should also include tackling stigma at the 
workplace associated with health problems to ensure that people feel comfortable discussing potential support 
measures that could help them remain productive at work. Conclusion To improve our understanding of the relationship between the quality of the work environment and at-
work productivity and to be able to use the findings to support people (with and without health problems) to 
remain productive at work, several developments in research and policy are indicated. First, more longitudinal 
studies that overcome the limitations addressed above are needed to improve the evidence base and to clarify 
the causal relationship between various factors of the quality of the work environment, health and 
productivity. Second, when studying productivity, researchers or policy makers need to be clear about what 
they want to measure, e.g. overall productivity or performance or health-related productivity loss. If the goal is 
to intervene on reduced productivity, a measurement instrument is needed that can indicate in which areas 
productivity problems are experienced and picks up change over time. Thirdly, this paper provides direction 
for the work factors that could be explored further in terms of their effect on productivity and interventions 
addressing these factors that would improve productivity. Fourthly, attention should be paid to the interaction 
between the individual and the workplace environment, especially for people with health problems who 
appear to benefit less from a good quality work environment than people without health problems. For those
