The release of the report To Err Is Human by the US Institute of Medicine in 2000 brought 
patient safety issues to the fore by presenting the magnitude and impact of patient safety problems in the 
US health system in clear detail. Since then a number of other countries have released similar reports with 
disturbingly similar messages for their health systems. This has put the need for improved patient safety 
monitoring and accountability under the spotlight. National administrations are now responding to the 
rising interest in patient safety and quality with efforts to improve measurement and reporting systems in 
these areas of health care performance. 2. 
To respond to country needs for internationally comparable information on indicators and data 
systems for quality, the OECD initiated the OECD Health Care Quality Indicator (HCQI) Project in 2001. 
The long-term objective of the HCQI Project is to develop a set of indicators that can be used to raise 
questions for further investigation concerning the quality of health care across countries. In March 2006 
the OECD published an initial report with data that was collected between 2003 and 2005 on an initial set 
of quality indicators (Mattke S et al, 2006). The results of this initial report from the HCQI Project showed 
clearly that there were only a limited number of indicators available for international comparisons for 
which there was consensus on the importance and soundness of the indicators and the availability and 
comparability of the data. Consequently, the OECD embarked on a new phase of work through the HCQI 
Project to work collaboratively with countries on improving data systems in five priority areas, including 
patient safety. A second round of data collection conducted in 2006 to support this work confirmed that 
there is a paucity of available national data to meaningfully track patient safety. 3. 
In part because of the lack of data and in part because of the very high level of interest across 
member countries, the OECD formed an Expert Group on Patient Safety, which met for the first time 
during June 2006 in Dublin, Ireland (OECD, 2007). The meeting was hosted by the Irish Department of 
Health and Children and was the first multi-country conference organised by the OECD on patient safety 
data systems. The conference attempted to address three issues: a) getting patient safety data systems on 
the agenda; b) developing a concrete work plan for improving patient safety data systems and international 
comparability of patient safety data; and c) addressing how countries should approach linking data to 
action to improve patient safety. 4. 
From the presentations made at the conference, it became apparent that the most readily available 
set of data systems for tracking patient safety are hospital administrative data systems. It is noted that 
efforts have been made in a growing number of OECD countries to adapt indicators developed in the US 
which can be derived from hospital administrative data. However, it was recognized that important issues 
still needed to be resolved before these indicators could be widely applied across OECD countries, 
including the construction of translations between different national approaches to data coding and the 
testing of indicators in the context of different country data systems. DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 8 5. 
The conference concluded with a commitment to increase the potential of cross national 
comparisons of patient safety through two key work initiatives focussing on: @BULLET Adaptation of hospital administrative data systems for facilitating cross-national comparative 
information of Patient Safety Indicators (PSI), and @BULLET Reviewing adverse event reporting systems. 6. 
As part of the overall effort under the first of these initiatives, this manual seeks to facilitate cross 
national comparisons of indicators for patient safety through the provision of detailed practical advice on 
calculating each indicator selected from a recommended set of Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) 2 utilising 
national hospital administrative databases. 7. 
The set of indicators selected for further analysis and specification is summarised in Table 1. Table 1: Selected Patient Safety Indicators Area 
Indicator name Hospital-acquired infections 
Infection due to medical care 
Decubitus ulcer Operative and post-operative 
complications Complications of anaesthesia 
Postoperative hip fracture 
Postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) 
Postoperative sepsis 
Technical difficulty with procedure 
Postoperative respiratory failure 
Iatrogenic pneumothorax Sentinel events 
Transfusion reaction 
Foreign body left in during procedure Obstetrics Birth trauma -injury to neonate 
Obstetric trauma – vaginal delivery with instrument 
Obstetric trauma – vaginal delivery without instrument 
Obstetric trauma -caesarean section 8. 
These indicators are a set of indicators providing information on potential in-hospital 
complications and adverse events following surgeries, procedures, and childbirth. They were developed 
after a comprehensive literature review, analysis of ICD-9-CM codes, clinician panel review, 
implementation of risk adjustment, and empirical analyses. 9. 
Methods to calculate the values of these indicators from hospital administrative data systems 
have until now been carried out only on local and national levels. In this manual, several steps are outlined 
to validate a methodology that could be applied internationally for data comparability. The first is a data-2 
The OECD HCQI Project convened a panel of experts on indicators for patient safety in 2004. Using a 
structured interview process the panel came forward with a recommendation that 21 indicators be further 
considered. See Millar J et al (2004). DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 9 based research effort that focuses on examining specific data elements and coding issues that currently 
impede international comparability of patient safety indicators based on hospital administrative data. Next, 
an experimental calculation of indicators is to be performed by a group of volunteering countries. 10. 
This manual was originally designed to support the calculation of patient safety indicators in a 
group of countries volunteering to participate in the validation of the methodology. However it is 
anticipated that the material presented will also be of interest to a wider audience, including researchers 
and experts interested in the technical background and construction of the Patient Safety Indicators and 
other countries looking to develop internationally comparable health care quality indicators. 11. 
The manual provides: @BULLET Generic coding and calculation instructions related to national hospital administrative databases, @BULLET Cross walk from ICD 9 to ICD 10 codes for each indicator, @BULLET Detailed definitions for calculation of indicators, @BULLET Flow charts for visualising the calculation process, and @BULLET Quick-step overview of essential tasks for data preparation. 12. 
It is anticipated that further revisions to the methodology presented in this manual will be made 
based on the collective experiences of those using the manual over time. DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 10 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES Introduction 13. 
The methodology for facilitating internationally comparable Patient Safety Indicators set out in 
this manual involves two key elements: @BULLET Cross-walk between the key disease classifications 
@BULLET Specified process of calculation 14. 
The Patient Safety Indicators dealt with in this manual are specified according to certain 
diagnosis and, in some instances, procedure codes. There are currently different medical classifications in 
use for coding diagnosis; the ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases) classification which is no 
longer updated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is the precursor of the present ICD-10 
classification. OECD member countries use ICD-9 (e.g. Spain, USA) as well as ICD-10 (e.g. Australia, 
Canada, Germany). For that reason this manual contains both versions of the coding system. 15. 
Usually countries do not use the original version of a classification published by the WHO but 
modify it according to their needs. Country modifications are still consistent with the WHO version, 
keeping the structure of the classification tree. In some chapters of the ICD classification the country 
versions are more extensive than the WHO version while in others they are not. This manual does not 
cover all the different country versions of the ICD. 16. 
The technical specifications of diagnosis in this manual are based on the ICD-10-WHO, 2006 and 
on the ICD-9-CM 3 . Therefore countries seeking to utilise this manual must ensure that before applying the 
definitions the defined codes for inclusion or exclusion criteria are currently in use. Otherwise the 
definitions at hand must be extended to include the subgroups added in the country modifications. 17. 
For example, Table 2 shows that one three-digit WHO code for decubitus ulcer corresponds to 8 
four-digit codes in Canada, 5 four-digit codes in Australia and 50 five-digit German codes. To calculate the 
numerator for the indicator decubitus ulcer, all country specific subgroups of the listed WHO code L89 
must be taken into account. 3. 
Definitions in ICD-9-CM are adopted from AHRQ (2003). DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 11 Table 2: Examples of Country Versions ICD-10

There are several criteria which are not consistent between countries that may influence the 
calculated rates of the indicators. These are: @BULLET Coding rules − Definition of principal diagnosis 
− Definition of secondary diagnosis 
@BULLET Use of diagnosis type indicators (e.g. marking of secondary diagnosis as  " present at admission " ) @BULLET Use of DRG for hospital reimbursement @BULLET Certain administrative case information − Admission type (elective, from long-term care, transferred from acute care) 
− Admission weight of neonates. 19. 
A questionnaire was distributed with this manual to collect more information on the coding 
specifications within each country participating in the initial experimental calculations of the indicators 
(Annex 3). Participating countries were asked to fill out the questionnaire and return it to the OECD 
Secretariat. The information on country specific coding specifications strongly facilitated the interpretation 
of the results by the OECD Secretariat. DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 12 Cross Walking from ICD-9 to ICD-10 20. 
The quantitative relationship between ICD-9 and ICD-10 is not 1:1. The ICD-10 is much more 
extensive than the ICD-9 and structures in the classification trees vary between the two. In a preliminary 
German project (Drösler et al, 2007), mapping of diagnoses and procedures was performed for each 
definition of the patient safety indicators (AHRQ 2004). Diagnosis mapping was performed using cross 
walking tables (DIMDI, 2007) between ICD-9-WHO V6.0 and ICD-10-German Modification 2004 in two 
steps, with updates of the indicator definitions appended to the translated version. 21. 
ICD-10 codes were manually revised after a preliminary crosswalk. Mapped ICD-10 codes with 
an unclear relationship to the original ICD-9-WHO code were compared to the ICD-9-CM, which is the 
origin of the indicator definitions. ICD-10 codes with correspondents in ICD-9-CM were rejected when the 
matching ICD-9-CM code had not been specified in the definition of the indicator. Transferred ICD-10 
codes were accepted when the medical concept matched the intention of the indicator definition. For 
example, the ICD-10 code T88.4  " Failed or difficult intubation "  was included to the numerator 
specification of indicator  " Complications of Anaesthesia "  because it was a mapped result to the 
corresponding ICD-9-CM-code E87.63  " Endotracheal tube wrongly placed during anaesthetic procedure " . 22. 
Due to the different country versions of the diagnosis classification, for an international project 
such as the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators Project it is necessary to find a common  " classification 
language " . Thus the country specific ICD-10 translations of the indicator definitions have been 
transformed to the ICD-10-WHO 2006 (WHO, 2006) to serve as the basis for the crosswalk. The ICD-10 
codes listed in this manual underwent an international harmonisation process initiated by the International 
Methodology Consortium for Coded Health Information (IMECCHI) research collaboration (Quan H et al, 
2008). Process of Calculation 23. 
The numerators pertain to subsets of the denominators. Calculate the denominator quantity first. 
Then apply the numerator definition to the selected denominator data. Exclusions of Principal Diagnosis 24. 
Verify the documentation rules for the principal diagnosis (main diagnosis, discharge diagnosis) 
in use for each country is required to decide how the exclusions of the principal diagnosis should be 
performed. Definitions of Principal Diagnosis (PDx) 4 A. The condition established after evaluation to be chiefly responsible for causing the 
hospitalisation. B. The diagnosis that is finally established to be the main reason for the hospital stay; that is 
demanding the most resources/medical effort over the course of the patients stay. 25. 
The original AHRQ patient safety manual is based on definition A (Department of Health and 
Human Services, 2005). For that reason most indicator definitions contain an exclusion rule if the 
principal diagnosis of the case is equal to a numerator defining ICD code. For these cases it is unlikely that 
the indicator-defining condition had been acquired during the hospital stay but was pre-existing. 4. 
Adapted from CIHI (2004). DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 13 26. 
In this manual it is assumed that countries using definition B for assignment of principal 
diagnosis are able to identify the case-related admission diagnosis (ADx) in their data sets. In this case 
patients with admission diagnosis corresponding to the numerator definition of the indicator should be 
excluded (see left-sided flow chart  " PDx algorithm "  on p.14). Furthermore it shall be avoided that 
countries using definition B for assignment of principal diagnosis miss numerator cases by assigning 
specific complications as principal diagnosis. If a diagnosis type indicator is in use data can be properly 
rearranged (see right-sided flow chart at Figure 1: PDx Algorithm). Secondary diagnosis 27. 
Patient safety indicators are largely constructed from secondary diagnoses. The calculation of the 
numerator builds on secondary diagnosis for most of the indicators. The indicator definitions refer to 
conditions aroused post admission. To make sure that all participating countries use the same definition of 
secondary diagnosis it is presented here: Definition of Secondary Diagnosis (SDx) 8 28. 
Comorbid conditions are those conditions for which the patient received treatment and consumed 
hospital resources in addition to those conditions considered to be the principal, main or discharge 
diagnosis. 34. 
Pre-admission conditions without any necessary treatment during the hospital stay do not meet 
the definition. Pre-admission comorbidities with in-hospital treatment meet the definition of the secondary 
diagnosis. Countries using diagnosis type indicators have the possibility to distinguish between pre-and 
post-admission comorbidities. If they perform additional exclusions of numerator cases their calculated 
rates might be lower than in countries where additional criteria for secondary diagnosis documentation are 
not in use. Use of codes for external causes of morbidity and mortality ( " E-codes " ) 35. 
Several indicators (e.g. Complications of Anaesthesia) build on diagnoses codes from Chapter 
XX (20) of the ICD-10 or the corresponding supplement of the ICD-9 respectively. The WHO designates 
those codes for additional documentation of external causes of morbidity. The availability of these codes in 
country modifications of the ICD may vary. Furthermore their use is optional in some countries. 
Depending on the extent of available e-codes in country modifications indicator rates may vary between 
countries. Exclusions of MDC 36. 
In countries using DRG for hospital reimbursement each case is assigned to a MDC (Major 
Diagnostic Category) by the grouper software. The MDC assignment relies exclusively on the principal 
diagnosis of the case (definition A above).The calculation of several indicators (Table 3) requires the 
exclusion of certain MDCs to ensure that whole populations with high risk for a condition are not counted. 
For example, MDC 9 (diseases of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and breast) is excluded from the calculation of 
indicator Decubitus Ulcer. Lists of ICD-10-WHO codes referring to certain MDCs are provided in the 
Annex 2 -Code List M 5 for countries using ICD-10 without DRG reimbursement or if the MDC 
assignment of data is impossible. 5. 
Code lists and neonate identification are adapted from (InEK, 2006 and Commonwealth of Australia, 
1998). DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 14 37. 
There are different methods to identify Neonates (MDC 15). If the admission weight of the 
neonate and the information on age in days is available in the dataset the algorithm below should be used 
for exclusion. Otherwise a code list will be provided in the Annex. Algorithm for neonate identification (MDC 15) 10 1 day <age<28 days or 27 days<age<365 days and 0 grams < weight < 2500 grams Table 3: Indicators with MDC exclusion Procedure Codes 38. 
The calculations of eight of the indicators require procedure codes. Those indicators are 
 " Postoperative Iatrogenic Pneumothorax " ,  " Postoperative Hip Fracture "   " Postoperative Respiratory 
Failure "   " Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) " ,  " Obstetric Trauma 
– Vaginal Delivery with / without instrument "  and  " Obstetric Trauma -Caesarean Section " . There is no 
common international medical procedure classification and each country participating in the experimental 
calculation of the indicators uses a different catalogue for procedure coding. In the project at hand it was 
not possible to provide a procedure code lists for each participating country. The procedure codes from the 
US ICD-9-CM are listed in this manual because they are part of the original indicator definitions provided 
by AHRQ. Furthermore, the procedure list provided in this manual shall support countries in adopting 
corresponding procedures from their classifications in order to perform a precise PSI calculation. 39. 
Five indicators refer to denominator cases with operative treatment only. Those are: @BULLET Complications of Anaesthesia 
@BULLET Postoperative Hip Fracture 
@BULLET Postoperative Respiratory Failure 
@BULLET Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) 
@BULLET Postoperative Sepsis MDC

Postoperative sepsis 
Decubitus ulcer 
Postoperative hip fracture

Postoperative respiratory failure DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 15 40. 
For selection of these cases a comparison between the coded procedures and a list of all operating 
room procedures available in a country's procedure classification is necessary. For the reasons explained 
above it is not possible to generate lists of operating room procedures for each country. The following 
interventional procedures are regarded as operative procedures: Pacemaker Implants, PTCA 6 or endoscopic 
vessel repair. D&C 7 is regarded as an operating room procedure where as a perineal laceration repair 
during a regular vaginal delivery is not. Flow Charts 41. 
For each indicator a flow chart is provided to facilitate the understanding of the indicator 
definition and the calculation process. For the construction of the flowcharts, definition A of the principal 
diagnosis ( " condition to be chiefly responsible " ) had been assumed. Countries using definition B 
( " condition demanding the most resources " ) for assignment of principal diagnosis are advised to rearrange 
their data in order to gain comparable results. A proposal for rearrangement is given in the flowchart at 
Figure 1: PDx Algorithm. General Note 42. 
Data quality is always a concern in health indicator analysis that can also substantially affect 
patient safety indicators. In addition to the proposed definitions, a comprehensive review of coding 
practices, distribution of key data elements and country specific coding standards is strongly recommended 
for data analysis of these PSIs. Given the nature of the PSIs, small sample size may lead to less precise 
estimates and requires special attention when reporting these indicators. All of these factors can affect 
comparability of the PSIs, and need to be addressed when making such comparisons. Remarks on Calculation of National Rates (Population Rates) and Mean Provider Rates 43. 
The questionnaire that was distributed with this manual to each country participating in the initial 
experimental calculations of the indicators (Annex 3) requested two different presentations of a country's 
results: @BULLET National rates (population rates) were requested to be reported in section VI of the 
questionnaire. The national rate / population rate for each indicator is the ratio between events 
(numerator) and population (denominator). The national rates (population rates) are weighted as it 
is pretended that all the cases included in the calculation lie in one hospital. @BULLET Mean provider rates were requested to be reported in section VII of the questionnaire. The 
calculation of a mean provider rate requires the possibility of data analysis on an institutional level. 
The mean provider rate of an indicator is the sum of the individual hospital rates for this indicator 
divided by the number of hospitals where this indicator was applied. Notes: @BULLET If for certain indicators, there were institutions without denominator populations (e.g. hospitals 
without an obstetric department) these were to be excluded from the calculation of the mean 
provider rate of that indicator. 
@BULLET Indicators with rates of zero (institutions where no numerator defining event occurred within a 
given denominator population) were to be included in the calculation of the mean provider rate. 
@BULLET Cases treated in psychiatric institutions were to be excluded from the calculation. 6. 
Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, an intervention in cardiology. 7. 
Dilation and Curettage, a gynaecological or obstetric treatment. DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 16 Quick Step Overview of Essential Tasks for Data Preparation The following outlines the key steps in preparing data for the calculation of the Patient Safety Indicators: 1. Convert listed ICD codes to your country's version of ICD 2. Look up in your ICD classification if there are codes available for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response syndrome). If these codes are available add them to the numerator inclusion list of the indicator Postoperative Sepsis 3. Look up in your ICD classification if there are codes available for Iatrogenic Pneumothorax. If these codes are available add them to the numerator inclusion list of the indicator Iatrogenic Pneumothorax 4. Look up the procedure codes in use in your country procedure classification for the following procedures: a.  " Interruption of Vena Cava "  Add a) to the denominator calculation of indicator Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism 
(PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). 
b.  " Obstetric Trauma "  
Add b) to the numerator calculation of all Obstetric Trauma indicators. 
c.  " Caesarean Delivery "  
Use c) to select the denominator population of indicator Obstetric Trauma –Caesarean 
Section Deliveries. 
d.  " Instrument-Assisted Delivery procedure codes "  
Use d) to select the denominator population of indicator Obstetric Trauma -Vaginal 
Delivery with Instrument 
e.  " Hip fracture repair "  
Cases with e) are excluded from the denominator population of indicator Postoperative 
Hip Fracture if the hip fracture repair occurs before or on the same day as the first 
operating room procedure. 
f.  " Endotracheal (re-)intubation 
Cases with f) are in the numerator population of indicator Postoperative Respiratory 
Failure if the reintubation occurs after the main OR procedure 
g.  " Diaphragmatic surgery repair, thoracic and cardiac surgery, lung or pleural biopsy "  (page. 
22, Annex 1 -Code List P) 
Add g) to the denominator exclusion of indicator Iatrogenic Pneumothorax 5. Check the definition of principal diagnosis (PDx) applied in your country 6. If the PDx definition is  " the condition to be chiefly responsible "  proceed to step 7. If the PDx definition is  " the condition demanding the most resources " , rearrange the data as shown in the flowchart at Figure 1: PDx Algorithm. 7. Flag cases with OR (operating room) procedures designated as  " surgical " . A comprehensive list of OR procedures must be provided by your country. 8. Apply calculation algorithm to each case as shown in the indicator-related flowcharts. DELSA/ELSA/WD/HTP(2008)1 17 List of Minimal Case-related Data-fields used for Indicator Calculation
