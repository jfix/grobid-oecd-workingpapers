			<body>Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>The Joint Working Party on Trade and Environment (JWPTE) agreed to develop a checklist on <lb/>environmental issues for negotiators of regional trade agreements (RTAs) as part of its Programme of <lb/>Work for 2007-8. The aim of the checklist is to provide guidance to countries wishing to include <lb/>environmental provisions in RTAs. <lb/>2. <lb/>The attached draft checklist includes issues that some countries have chosen to include in all or <lb/>some of the RTAs they have signed, and which other countries may find useful when considering their <lb/>own approaches to environmental issues in RTAs. It draws on countries&apos; experience of negotiating and <lb/>implementing environmental provisions of RTAs, as described in the book &quot; Environment and Regional <lb/>Trade Agreements &quot; (OECD, 2007), as well as more recent experiences. The boxes provide illustrative <lb/>examples drawn from some of the recent RTAs. They present partial excerpts from some agreements, and <lb/>are not intended to be comprehensive. Further information may be obtained via the links to the agreements <lb/>that are embedded in the text. <lb/>3. <lb/>The checklist is not prescriptive. It is intended to provide a reference to assist discussion of <lb/>environmental issues, when the inclusion of environmental provisions is considered appropriate, before, <lb/>during and after negotiation of trade agreements. Since the adoption of the North America Free Trade <lb/>Agreement (NAFTA) in the early 1990s, there have been major changes in the ways in which <lb/>environmental provisions have been integrated in regional trade agreements, both qualitatively and <lb/>quantitatively. The parties to NAFTA (Canada, Mexico and the US) have modified their approaches in <lb/>response to evolving needs, and other countries have developed their own approaches according to their <lb/>specific needs and interests. As the number and variety of RTAs continues to increase, the checklist should <lb/>be viewed as a &quot; living document &quot; that could be modified and updated as countries gain new experience. <lb/>4. <lb/>The checklist consists of the following four sections: 1) alternative approaches for incorporating <lb/>environmental provisions in RTAs; 2) environmental impact assessment of RTAs; 3) the contents of <lb/>environmental provisions; 4) institutional issues; and 5) overarching issues. <lb/></body>

			<body>Alternative approaches for incorporating environmental provisions in RTAs <lb/>5. <lb/>Provisions dealing with environmental issues can be incorporated in different ways into trade <lb/>agreements. Many countries include references to, or key statements on, environment in the preamble of <lb/>agreements. Some agreements have a few provisions and others a full chapter on environment; some have <lb/>a side agreement dealing with environmental issues; some have both. <lb/>Mandate to include environmental issues in trade agreements <lb/>• What is the Parties&apos; mandate to include environmental considerations in trade agreements?<lb/>• What are the key elements of that mandate?<lb/>• Which of these elements are legally binding?<lb/>• Which Ministries have responsibility for implementing the mandate?<lb/>Basic choices regarding environmental issues in RTAs <lb/>There are various ways in which environmental provisions can be included in RTAs: directly in <lb/>the agreement or in a side agreement or both. The provisions may or may not be legally binding. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Box 1. Mandates relating to environment in trade agreements <lb/>• The United States Trade Act of 2002 sets out overall trade negotiating objectives, which are inter alia, &quot; to <lb/>ensure that trade and environmental policies are mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve <lb/>the environment and enhance the international means of doing so, while optimizing the use of the world&apos;s <lb/>resources; and to seek provisions in trade agreements under which parties to those agreements strive to <lb/>ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor <lb/>laws as an encouragement for trade; &quot; . The Trade Act also sets out principal negotiating objectives related <lb/>specifically to environmental matters, &quot; to ensure that a party to a trade agreement with the United States <lb/>does not fail to effectively enforce its environmental or labor laws, through a sustained or recurring course <lb/>of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the United States and that party after entry into <lb/>force of a trade agreement between those countries; to strengthen trading partners&apos; capacity to protect the <lb/>environment through the promotion of sustainable development; to seek market access for US <lb/>environmental technologies, goods, and services; and to ensure that environmental, health, or safety <lb/>policies and practices policies and practices of the parties in trade agreements with the United States do <lb/>not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against US exports or serve as disguised barriers to trade &quot; ; <lb/>http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/or/81534.htm<lb/>• In New Zealand, a Cabinet-mandated directive instructs the government to integrate trade and <lb/>environment policies in all international negotiations. The 2001 &quot; Framework for Integrating Environmental <lb/>Standards and Trade Agreements &quot; guides and informs New Zealand&apos;s trade and environment <lb/>negotiations and provides overarching trade and environment policy principles to ensure that sustainable <lb/>development considerations are incorporated in all its international negotiations; <lb/>http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/WTO/0-environment-<lb/>framework.php.<lb/></note>

			<body>• Will environmental issues be dealt with in the body of the RTA, in a separate agreement, or in <lb/>both?<lb/>• Will trade and environment issues be negotiated together or separately?<lb/>• What type of commitments related to environment will the agreement contain: binding, non-<lb/>binding, a mixture of both?<lb/>• Will the environmental provisions be enforceable or subject to dispute resolution?<lb/>Box 2. Some basic choices concerning treatment of the environment in RTAs <lb/>Environment as part of the RTA <lb/>• The Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) Treaty includes a Chapter on &quot; Co-operation <lb/>in Environment and Natural Resources &quot; (Chapter VI); http://www.ecowas.int/.<lb/>• The Partnership Agreement between the ACP Group of States and the EC (Cotonou Agreement) deals with <lb/> &quot; Environment and Natural Resources &quot; in Chapter 32; <lb/>http://ec.europa.eu/development/ICenter/Pdf/agr01_en.pdf.<lb/>Environmental side agreements <lb/>• The Environment Co-operation Agreement among the Parties to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic <lb/>Partnership Agreement (Brunei Darussalam, the Republic of Chile, New Zealand, and the Republic of <lb/>Singapore) is a separate environmental side agreement, negotiated in parallel with the trade agreement; <lb/>http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/trade-agreement/transpacific/environment-agreement.pdf<lb/>• MERCOSUR members adopted a Framework Agreement on Environment in 2001, ten years after the adoption <lb/>of the main trade agreement; http://www.medioambiente.gov.ar/mercosur.<lb/>Environment in the RTA and in a separate agreement <lb/>• The North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as all RTAs subsequently negotiated by the US, <lb/>include detailed environmental provisions, and have, in addition, a side agreement or other separate <lb/>instruments dealing with environmental issues, such as the North American Agreement on Environmental Co-<lb/>operation (NAAEC); http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/nafta-alena/agree-en.asp. (NAFTA); <lb/>http://www.cec.org/pubs_info_resources/law_treat_agree/naaec/index.cfm?varlan=english (NAEEC).<lb/>• The US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (US-CAFTA-DR) includes a chapter on <lb/>the Environment (Chapter 17), and has an Environmental Co-operation Agreement (US-CAFTA-DR ECA <lb/>http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html (US-<lb/>CAFTA-DR); http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/or/42423.htm (US-CAFTA-DR ECA).<lb/>Box 3. Legally binding vs non-binding commitments on the environment <lb/>In most current RTAs, provisions on the environment are formulated in a non-binding manner (hortatory language, <lb/> &quot; strive for &quot; commitments, etc.) <lb/>•  The Arrangement on Environment signed in conjunction with the New Zealand-Thailand Closer Economic<lb/>Partnership Agreement indicates (in Section 4) that the Arrangement &quot; represents a political commitments <lb/>but does not legally bind either country. &quot; <lb/>http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/environment.html. <lb/>Some RTAs, including all recent RTAs by the United States, contain legally binding environmental provisions. <lb/>•  NAAEC provides for an obligation by the Parties to effectively enforce their environmental laws, and includes<lb/>a mechanism to ensure enforcement of this commitment (dispute settlement and public submissions <lb/>mechanisms) http:// www.cec.org/pubs_info_resources/law_treat_agree/naaec/index.cfm?varlan=english <lb/>(NAAEC). <lb/></body>

			<body>Environmental Impact Assessments of RTAs <lb/>6. <lb/>Environmental assessments of RTAs are used to identify and manage the environmental impacts <lb/>that may result from the agreement. Ex ante assessments often contribute to the preparation of the <lb/>agreement. Ex post assessments analyse the impacts of the agreement and may result in proposals to amend <lb/>the agreement. Some countries include participatory and consultative mechanisms into the assessment of <lb/>RTAs in order to strengthen the information base and to build support for the agreements. <lb/>• Is there a mandate to conduct an environmental assessment?<lb/>• Will the assessment be ex ante, ex post, or both?<lb/>• Will impacts be assessed only in the country doing the assessment or in all partner countries?<lb/>• To what extent will the transboundary effects of the agreement be considered?<lb/>• What methodology will be used for the assessment?<lb/>• Will responsibility for conducting the assessment be assigned to a government department or an <lb/>independent contractor?<lb/>• Who will be involved in the assessment (e.g., other agencies, experts, stakeholders, etc.), how <lb/>and at which stages?<lb/>• How will the assessment be financed, and what is the timeframe?<lb/>• Will the findings on likely environmental effects be fed into the negotiation mandate or the actual <lb/>negotiation of the agreement?<lb/></body>

			<body>Box 4. Mandates to carry out environmental assessments <lb/>• The EU carries out Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs) for the negotiation of major multilateral, regional <lb/>and bilateral trade agreements. This practice has not yet evolved into a strict legal obligation but is supported <lb/>by the Communication on Impact Assessment issued by the EU Commission in 2002, which has the legal <lb/>status of a policy guideline. It requires the Commission to execute environmental, economic and social impact <lb/>studies for different types of major regulatory initiatives; http://www.trade-<lb/>nfo.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2005/february/tradoc_121479.pdf.<lb/>• Canada derives its mandate to conduct Environmental Assessments (EAs) of trade agreements from the 1999 <lb/> &quot; Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals &quot; and the 2001 <lb/> &quot; Framework for Conducting Environmental Assessment of Trade Negotiations &quot; ; http://www.dfait-<lb/>maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/Environment-en.asp#annex1 (1999 Cabinet Directive); http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-<lb/>nac/Environment-en.asp#N_1_ (2001 Framework).<lb/>• In New Zealand, a Parliamentary Standing Order requires that a National Interest Analysis be conducted for all <lb/>treaties to which New Zealand may become a Party. The NIA includes an environmental component and is <lb/>supported by the 2001 &quot; Framework for Integrating Environmental Standards and Trade Agreements &quot; . <lb/>However, a NIA is required after the agreement is signed, so there is no opportunity to influence the <lb/>negotiating mandate or the negotiations. http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/636A8940-48FA-<lb/>4A93-B8E6-3DD0844BB68E/0/SO2003bm.pdf (Parliamentary Standing Order 383); <lb/>http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/WTO/0-environment-framework.php <lb/>(2001 Framework).<lb/>• In the United States, the framework for conducting Environmental Reviews (ERs) of trade agreements is <lb/>provided by Executive Order 13141 &quot; Environmental Review of Trade Agreements &quot; (1999) and the Guidelines <lb/>for Implementation of Executive Order 13141 (2000) http://www.nepa.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13141.html (1999 <lb/>Executive Order 13141); <lb/>http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Sectors/Environment/Guidelines_for_Environmental_Reviews/asset_upload <lb/>_file556_5734.pdf (2000 Guidelines).<lb/>Box 5. Geographical scope of assessments <lb/>• Environmental assessments of trade agreements by Canada and the United States focus on environmental <lb/>impacts in their respective countries. Transboundary effects are only considered to the extent that they have <lb/>direct impacts on the environment in the assessing country.<lb/>• The EU&apos;s Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs) explore not only environmental but also economic and <lb/>social impacts. They also focus on impacts in partner countries. Some assessments involve almost no analysis <lb/>of impacts in the EU but focus almost exclusively on environmental impacts in partner countries, such as the <lb/>ongoing EU-African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) SIA. <lb/>http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/issues/global/sia/studies_geo.htm#acp<lb/>Box 6. In-house vs. external assessments <lb/>• In Canada and the United States, environmental assessments are conducted by the government, and involve <lb/>government experts and negotiators. The US also seeks and incorporates, as appropriate, public comment on <lb/>its environmental reviews.<lb/>• The EU Commission awards contracts to carry out SIAs to independent external consultants following a public <lb/>tender procedure. A consultation committee within the Commission is set up to guide the consultants. Civil <lb/>society coordination with Member State experts and Members of the European Parliament is part of the SIA <lb/>process.<lb/></body>

This is set out in the &apos;Handbook for Trade SIAs&apos;. <lb/>http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/march/tradoc_127974.pdf<lb/>7. <lb/>Some countries jointly conduct feasibility studies to analyse their trade relations and to assess <lb/>whether or not to enter into a RTA. Such feasibility studies may be conducted prior to, or in conjunction <lb/>with, an ex ante environmental assessment. <lb/>• Will the feasibility study include environmental considerations, and, if so, how?<lb/>• Who will be involved in carrying out the feasibility study?<lb/>Box 8. Environmental considerations in the feasibility study of trade agreements <lb/>• In the New Zealand-China Trade and Economic Cooperation Framework, which provides for a Joint Feasibility <lb/>Study into a bilateral FTA negotiation, New Zealand and China committed to exploring opportunities to share <lb/>information and to cooperate on measures to promote environmental protection, sustainable development and <lb/>resource management, and the protection of biodiversity. It reaffirms objectives that the two countries have been <lb/>working on through existing mechanisms in areas such as agriculture, including wool, forestry, science and <lb/>technology, tourism, education, environmental protection and investment. http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-<lb/>Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/0--Trade-agreements/China/0-chapterone.php#trade<lb/>Contents of environmental provisions <lb/>8. <lb/>This section deals with the contents of environmental provisions that could be dealt with in RTAs <lb/>or in environmental side agreements. It includes; key statements on the environment; references to <lb/>environmental laws and standards; environmental cooperation; procedural guarantees, enforcement and <lb/>dispute settlement; and environmental exceptions and safeguard clauses. <lb/></body>

			<body>Key statements on environment <lb/>9. <lb/>Some RTAs include references to environment and sustainable development in their preambles. <lb/>• What kind of statements on the environment and/or sustainable development will be included in <lb/>the preamble of the agreement?<lb/>• What environmentally-related principles and approaches will be referred to in the agreement?<lb/>Box 9. Statements on environment and sustainable development in RTA preambles <lb/>• NAFTA:  &quot; The Government of Canada, the Government of the United Mexican States and the Government of the <lb/>United States of America, resolved to: […] UNDERTAKE each of the preceding in a manner consistent with <lb/>environmental protection and conservation; […] PROMOTE sustainable development; STRENGTHEN the <lb/>development and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations; […] &quot; http://www.nafta-sec-<lb/>alena.org/DefaultSite/index_e.aspx?DetailID=79.<lb/>• EC-Chile Association Agreement: The Contracting Parties (the European Community including its Member States <lb/>and the Republic of Chile) &quot; CONSIDERING the traditional links between the Parties and with particular reference <lb/>to: […] the need to promote economic and social progress for their peoples, taking into account the principle of <lb/>sustainable development and environmental protection requirements &quot; http://eur-<lb/>lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2002/l_352/l_35220021230en00031439.pdf.<lb/>• Japan-Brunei Economic Partnership Agreement: Parties are &quot; Recognizing that economic development, social <lb/>development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable <lb/>development and that the economic partnership can play an important role in promoting sustainable development &quot; <lb/>http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/brunei/epa0706/agreement.pdf<lb/>Environmental co-operation <lb/>10. <lb/>Countries have chosen different forms of co-operation. Some have agreed on broad co-operation <lb/>agreements, covering a large range of areas; others focus co-operation on specific issues of common <lb/>interest. Agreements between developed and developing countries often provide for capacity-building. <lb/>• What are the objectives of environmental co-operation between the Parties?<lb/>• How can areas of co-operation best be identified and dealt with?<lb/>• How will Parties implement co-operation arrangements under the agreement?<lb/>• How will Parties ensure that co-operation under the RTA complements ongoing co-operation <lb/>efforts (e.g., environmental capacity building under multilateral environmental agreements; co-<lb/>operation through development cooperation program.)?<lb/>• How will Parties review, assess and update co-operation efforts?<lb/></body>

			<body>Box 10. Environmental co-operation arrangements in RTAs <lb/>Broad co-operation arrangements <lb/>• Euro-Med Agreement (e.g. between the EU and Algeria, 2002), Preamble: the Contracting Parties are &quot; DESIROUS <lb/>of establishing cooperation sustained by regular dialogue on economic, scientific, technological, social, cultural, <lb/>audio-visual and environmental issues in order to achieve better mutual understanding &quot; <lb/>http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/euromed/med_ass_agreemnts.htm (EU-Med Agreements).<lb/>• The Environmental Cooperation Agreement of the US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement <lb/>(US-CAFTA-DR, 2005) establishes a framework for cooperation among the parties to protect, improve and <lb/>conserve the environment, including natural resources. It sets out the modalities and forms of cooperation by <lb/>stating that &quot; cooperation developed under the Agreement may occur through bilateral or regional capacity-building <lb/>activities, taking into account relevant environmental cooperation provisions of bilateral or regional free trade <lb/>agreements between the parties […] on the basis of technical and/or financial assistance programs […]. The <lb/>Agreement identifies the following priorities for environmental co-operation activities: a) strengthening each Party&apos;s <lb/>environmental management systems, including reinforcing institutional and legal frameworks and the capacity to <lb/>develop, implement, administer, and enforce environmental laws, regulations, standards, and policies; b) <lb/>developing and promoting incentives and other flexible and voluntary mechanisms in order to encourage <lb/>environmental protection, including the development of market-based initiatives and economic incentives for <lb/>environmental management; c) fostering partnerships to address current or emerging conservation and <lb/>management issues, including personnel training and capacity building […] <lb/>http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/or/42423.htm<lb/>• New Zealand-China FTA (2008) (Article 177): the Parties shall &quot; enhance their communication and cooperation on <lb/>labour and environment matters through both the Memorandum of Understanding on Labour Cooperation and the <lb/>Environment Cooperation Agreement between the Parties. &quot; http://chinafta.govt.nz/1-The-agreement/2-Text-of-the-<lb/>agreement/15-Chapt-14-Cooperation/index.php.<lb/>Co-operation in one specific area of special interest to the Parties <lb/>• Agreement between ASEAN Member States and Korea (2005) under which Parties commit to &quot; pursue […] on a <lb/>mutually agreed basis: cooperation in environmental technologies and policies, such as compressed natural gas <lb/>technology and policy […] &quot; (Article 11, Annex of the Framework Agreement) http://www.aseansec.org/18067.htm.<lb/>• Japan-Thailand agreement (2007) (Article 153): Parties have agreed to &quot; promote cooperation between the <lb/>governments of the Parties […] such as in the fields of &quot; agriculture, forestry and fisheries &quot; and &quot; science, technology, <lb/>energy and environment &quot; . http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/thailand/epa0704/agreement.pdf.<lb/>• Environment Cooperation Agreement between New Zealand and China (2008) (Article 2): &quot; Cooperative activities <lb/>may be in areas including but not limited to: environmental management, environmental remediation, nature <lb/>conservation, and technologies for environmental benefit.

			<body>• How will Parties ensure co-ordination between ministries on environmental issues following <lb/>adoption of the agreement?<lb/>Institutional arrangements for implementation <lb/>15. <lb/>The implementation of environmental provisions in trade agreements requires some institutional <lb/>arrangements. Under some agreements, Parties have set up joint institutions, whose mandate is provided <lb/>for in the agreement. Parties often also commit to meet regularly to discuss implementation, and designate <lb/>new or existing national institutions to oversee implementation at the domestic level. <lb/>• Which institutions are needed to oversee the environmental aspects of the RTA, both <lb/>domestically and among the Parties?<lb/>• Will an existing or a new institution be charged with overseeing implementation of the <lb/>environmental aspects of the agreement?<lb/>• What is the mandate of the institution charged with overseeing implementation of the agreement?<lb/>• What will be the reporting mechanisms of these institutions (e.g. reporting to trade and <lb/>environment ministries or a body charged with overall implementation of the agreement)?<lb/>Relationship with other international commitments <lb/>16. <lb/>Some RTAs strive for consistency with the trade and environment provisions in other <lb/>international agreements, i.e. multilateral environmental agreements. <lb/>• How will the relationship between the RTA and other international commitments (in particular, <lb/>multilateral and regional environmental agreements and trade obligations) be reflected in the <lb/>RTA?<lb/>• How will potential conflicts on environment and trade issues between international commitments <lb/>and the RTA be handled?<lb/>Box 16. Institutions to oversee the environmental elements of the RTA <lb/>Many RTAs, and in some cases their environmental side agreements, establish specific institutions, composed of <lb/>representatives of the Parties, to oversee the implementation of the environmental commitments in the agreement. <lb/>• The NAAEC provides for a Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to be set up (Article 8). <lb/>http://www.cec.org/pubs_info_resources/law_treat_agree/naaec/index.cfm?varlan=english<lb/>• The Environment Committee set up under the Arrangement on Environment between New Zealand and <lb/>Thailand is comprised of senior officials of the government agencies responsible for environmental matters. <lb/>Article 3 (paragraph 4 and paragraph 7). http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-<lb/>archive/0--Trade-agreements/Thailand/0-environment.php<lb/>Under some agreements, an existing institution is assigned responsibilities to deal with matters arising from the <lb/>agreement&apos;s provisions. <lb/>• Under the US-CAFTA-DR (Article 17.7), the existing Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration <lb/>(SIECA), has been assigned to deal with public submissions by citizens from all Parties, except US citizens, <lb/>who <lb/>may <lb/>bring <lb/>submissions <lb/>before <lb/>the <lb/>CEC <lb/>established <lb/>under <lb/>the <lb/>NAAEC. <lb/>http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html<lb/></body>

The relationship between provisions in the RTA and other international commitments <lb/>· NAFTA, in its Article 104 (Relation to Environmental and Conservation Agreements), provides: &quot; In the event of any <lb/>inconsistency between this Agreement and the specific trade obligations set out in: a) the Convention on <lb/>International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora […],b) the Montreal Protocol on Substances <lb/>that Deplete the Ozone Layer […],c) the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of <lb/>Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal […], or d) the agreements set out in Annex 104.1, such obligations shall <lb/>prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, provided that where a Party has a choice among equally effective and <lb/>reasonably available means of complying with such obligations, the Party chooses the alternative that is the least <lb/>inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement &quot; (paragraph 1) and that &quot; The Parties may agree in writing <lb/>to modify Annex 104.1 to include any amendment to an agreement referred to in paragraph 1, and any other <lb/>environmental or conservation agreement &quot; (paragraph 2); http://www.nafta-sec-<lb/>alena.org/DefaultSite/index_e.aspx?DetailID=79. <lb/>· The US-CAFTA-DR includes an article on the Relationship to Environmental Agreements (Article 17.12): &quot; The <lb/>Parties recognize that multilateral environmental agreements to which they are all party play an important role in <lb/>protecting the environment globally and domestically and that their respective implementation of these agreements <lb/>is critical to achieving the environmental objectives of these agreements. The Parties further recognize that this <lb/>Chapter and the ECA can contribute to realizing the goals of those agreements. Accordingly, the Parties shall <lb/>continue to seek means to enhance the mutual supportiveness of multilateral environmental agreements to which <lb/>they are all party and trade agreements to which they are all party &quot; (paragraph 1). &quot; The Parties may consult, as <lb/>appropriate, with respect to ongoing negotiations in the WTO regarding multilateral environmental agreements &quot; <lb/>(paragraph 2); http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-<lb/>DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html <lb/>· The Canada-Chile Agreement provides in its Article A-03 that &quot; [i]n the event of any inconsistency between this <lb/>Agreement and such other agreements, this Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, except as <lb/>otherwise provided in this Agreement &quot; (paragraph 2). It further provides that &quot; [i]n the event of any inconsistency <lb/>between this Agreement and the specific trade obligations set out in: (a) the Convention on International Trade in <lb/>Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora […]; (b) the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the <lb/>Ozone Layer; or (c) the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and <lb/>Their Disposal […], such obligations shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, provided that where a Party has <lb/>a choice among equally effective and reasonably available means of complying with such obligations, the Party <lb/>chooses the alternative that is the least inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement. &quot; http://www.dfait-<lb/>maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/cda-chile/menu-en.asp <lb/></body>

			<body>Overarching issues <lb/>17. <lb/>This section refers to overarching issues that need to be considered through all the phases related <lb/>to the negotiation and implementation of the RTA. <lb/>Budget <lb/>• Will the RTA address financing issues and, if so, how?<lb/>• Which aspects of the implementation of the RTAs require on-going funding?<lb/>• Which ministry or department will provide funding for environmental issues under the RTA?<lb/>• How will a recurring budget for environmental co-operation be secured?<lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Box 18. RTA provisions on funding <lb/>Some trade agreements or side agreements on the environment specifically address financial issues. <lb/>•  The Canada-Costa Rica Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (CCRAEC), for instance, provides that<lb/>funding for the co-operative activities agreed by the Parties will be determined on a case-by-case basis <lb/>(Article 8, paragraph 2); http://www.ec.gc.ca/international/costarica/env_coop_e.pdf. <lb/>•  Financing for capacity building activities set out by the Commission under the Environment Affairs Council of<lb/>the US-Chile agreement will be provided &quot; according to legislation and availability of resources in each Party &quot; ; <lb/>http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral/Chile_FTA/Final_Texts/Section_Index.html. <lb/>Many RTA efforts toward improved environmental management rely on funding from national development agencies <lb/>or ministry budgets. <lb/>· Co-operation and capacity building for the Euro-Med Agreements are financed and managed by the EU&apos;s <lb/>traditional aid delivery bodies. <lb/>· New Zelaand makes funding available for negotiations and some implementation activities through a cross-<lb/>departmental funding pool. Departments also have some funding available through baseline budgets for <lb/>implementation activities. <lb/>Some RTAs include references to funding for dispute settlement proceedings <lb/>· The Joint Committee, set up under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (Article 21.1), is among other issues, <lb/>responsible for establishing &quot; the amounts of remuneration and expenses to be paid to panellists &quot; (paragraph 2) <lb/>included in a dispute settlement panel. The Agreement further provides that &quot; [t]he remuneration of panellists, their <lb/>travel and lodging expenses, and all general expenses relating to proceedings of a panel established under <lb/>Article 21.7 shall be borne equally by the Parties &quot; (paragraph 3); <lb/>http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/final-text/index.html. <lb/>Public participation <lb/>18. <lb/>Many governments establish public participation and consultative processes in the negotiation <lb/>and implementation of RTAs. Some RTAs provide for public participation in dispute settlement <lb/>procedures. Consultative and participatory processes can enhance the quality of the design and <lb/>implementation of RTAs by facilitating the input of information and expertise. They can also help to build <lb/>public and political support for the agreements. <lb/></div>

			<body>• Are there any requirements for public participation or consultation with experts when developing <lb/>or implementing the RTA, or for dispute settlement?<lb/>• How will public or expert input be fed into the negotiation or implementation of the RTA?<lb/>• Are specific mechanisms in place for public participation or consultation with experts on <lb/>environmental issues during the negotiation or implementation of the RTA or for dispute <lb/>settlement?<lb/>Box 19. Public participation during the negotiation of environmental issues in RTAs <lb/>• <lb/> Canada uses a range of public consultation mechanisms, including internet consultations and workshops in <lb/>relation with trade agreements under negotiation, including on environmental impact assessments; <lb/>http://international.gc.ca/tna-nac/consult-en.asp#Cur.<lb/>• <lb/> The USTR and the EPA co-host the Trade and Environment Policy Advisory Committee (TEPAC) to seek <lb/>inputs from the high level group of representatives from the industry, environmental and consumer interest <lb/>groups, agriculture, services, and non-Federal governments. The committee is required by its charter to be <lb/> &quot; broadly representative of key sectors and groups of the economy, with an interest in trade and environment <lb/>policy issues. &quot; TEPAC meetings are announced through Federal Register notices and its reports are <lb/>published on the USTR website; http://www.ustr.gov.<lb/>• <lb/> New Zealand involves the public through internet consultations. e.g. on feasibility studies of a trade <lb/>agreement before starting the negotiations (for example, public consultation on the joint feasibility study on <lb/>an FTA with China; http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/0--Trade-<lb/>agreements/China/0-publicconsultationdoc.php.) and through information bulletins during the course of the <lb/>negotiations; (http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/Trade-Agreements/China/index.php).<lb/>• <lb/> The EU has a structured dialogue with civil society organisations (business associations, NGOs, trade <lb/>unions, agricultural associations, etc), where all trade matters are discussed, including ongoing negotiations <lb/>of RTAs. (Civil Society Dialogue website of the European Commission&apos;s Directorate-General for External <lb/>Trade: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/civilsoc/index.cfm ). In addition, consultations with civil society and the <lb/>public at large are held during the various stages of the drafting of Trade SIAs, so that civil society can <lb/>directly input into the preparation of these assessments. A workshop for civil society organisations of the <lb/>partner country/ies concerned is also organised. During the SIA process, a specific website is opened <lb/>for civil society as well as the public to send their written contributions on the SIAs.<lb/>Box 20. Mechanisms for public participation in RTAs <lb/>Some RTAs contain mechanisms for public participation in the negotiation and implementation of the agreement. <lb/>• <lb/> The Agreement on Environmental Co-operation between Canada and Costa Rica provides in its Article 11 <lb/>(Public Engagement) that &quot; [t]he Parties will develop mechanisms to inform the public of activities undertaken <lb/>pursuant to this Agreement, and will make efforts to create opportunities to engage the public, as <lb/>appropriate, in such activities &quot; ; http://www.ec.gc.ca/international/costarica/env_coop_e.pdf.<lb/>• <lb/> Under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (Article 19.3, paragraph 4): &quot; Each Party shall promote public <lb/>awareness of its environmental laws by ensuring that information is available to the public regarding its <lb/>environmental laws and enforcement and compliance procedures, including procedures for interested <lb/>persons to request the Party&apos;s competent authorities to investigate alleged violations of its environmental <lb/>laws. A Party may use a variety of means available for this purpose, such as publishing information and <lb/>notices in official bulletins and the mass media, publishing and distributing information manuals, undertaking <lb/>compliance assistance programs, conducting meetings, and making information available through the <lb/>Internet &quot; ; http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/final-text/index.html<lb/></body>

			<body>Some RTAs put in place public participation mechanisms in the context of dispute settlement. <lb/>• <lb/> Article 20.11 of the US-CAFTA-DR (Third Party Participation) provides that &quot; [a] Party that is not a disputing <lb/>Party, on delivery of a written notice to the disputing Parties, shall be entitled to attend all hearings, to make <lb/>written and oral submissions to the panel, and to receive written submissions of the disputing Parties in <lb/>accordance with the Model Rules of Procedure. Those submissions shall be reflected in the final report of <lb/>the <lb/>panel &quot; ; <lb/>http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html<lb/>• <lb/> The Australia-US RTA instructs the Parties to develop model rules of procedure that ensure &quot; that the panel <lb/>shall consider requests from nongovernmental persons or entities in the Parties&apos; territories to provide written <lb/>views regarding the dispute that may assist the panel in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the <lb/>Parties and provide the Parties an opportunity to respond to such written views &quot; (Article 21.8, paragraph <lb/>1.d); http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/final-text/index.html.<lb/>Performance review of environmental provisions in RTAs <lb/>19. <lb/>Reviewing the performance of environmental provisions in RTAs provides information on the <lb/>extent to which its objectives have been achieved, and provides a basis for considering possible <lb/>amendments to the RTA. <lb/>• Will the review cover all or selected parts of the environmental provisions of the RTA?<lb/>• What period should elapse before the first review?<lb/>• How frequently should the reviews be carried out?<lb/>• Who should carry out the review; who should pay for it and to whom should the findings be <lb/>reported?<lb/>• If Parties decide to carry out an ex-post environment assessment of RTAs, will the results of such <lb/>assessment as well as those of the assessment and review of cooperation efforts be fed into the <lb/>performance review of the environmental provisions in RTAs, and if so, how?<lb/>Box 21. Performance Review <lb/>• <lb/> The Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPSEPA) includes Article 4.5; &apos;After <lb/>three years, or as otherwise agreed, the Parties shall review the operation of this (Environment) <lb/>Agreement and report to the TPSEP Commission&apos;.<lb/>• <lb/> In 2004, an independent Ten-year Review and Assessment Committee (TRAC) was formed to <lb/>undertake an examination of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. TRAC <lb/>produced a report that reviewed the implementation of the NAAEC and provide an assessment of the <lb/>impacts of the various programs of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The report <lb/>included an examination of the institutional aspects of the CEC, the implementation of the specific <lb/>mechanisms of the NAAEC, and how the CEC has addressed the environmental impacts of NAFTA. <lb/>The report also provided recommendations to the Council on charting a path for the CEC over the next <lb/>decade. The review of the NAAEC is the only ex-post assessment so far.</body>
