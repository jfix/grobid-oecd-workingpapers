telecommunications, postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — in the national and multilateral contexts. 
The economic and social significance of these services means that they are high on the list of development 
priorities in many countries. Enhanced trade and investment in network infrastructure services can help 
achieve these development goals. Liberalisation, however, is no easy task and requires sound regulation 
and effective institutions to address market failures and ensure public policy objectives. If appropriately 
designed, bound liberalisation under the GATS can contribute to the advancement of national objectives by 
improving investor's confidence when countries decide to allow private sector participation in these 
services. The WTO services agreement can affect the regulatory conduct of governments in some areas of 
network infrastructure services, particularly when specific commitments are made. This is intensified by 
the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to be tested in 
practice. It is thus crucial to carefully examine its provisions and tailor-specific commitments to national 
policy objectives. Keywords: Network, infrastructure, public services, liberalisation, regulation, GATS. AKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study has been prepared by Massimo Geloso Grosso of the OECD Trade Directorate under the

exploring experience with competition in several services sectors previously provided solely by 
governments. In recent years, trade in network infrastructure services — including telecommunications, 
postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — has increased, following changes in their provision leading to 
stronger competition. In developing countries, in particular, liberalisation is seen as a way to increase 
investment and improve infrastructure performance. Due to lack of domestic capacity and finance, when 
developing country governments decide to open these services to competition, it usually includes a 
decision to accept foreign participation. Technological innovation has also expanded the scope for 
competition in sectors such as telecommunications and postal/courier and, to a lesser extent, energy. Even 
where competition in the market may not be feasible due to features of scale and natural monopoly 
associated with these services, competition for the market has been introduced through various contractual 
arrangements between the public and private sectors. These have emerged as alternatives to privatisation. While liberalisation can confer significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency, access and 
affordability of services, it must be appropriately designed and supported by a strong regulatory 
framework. Governments have at their disposal a variety of regulatory tools and approaches to address 
market failures and meet public policy objectives in the new environment. First, governments retain a major role in regulating tariffs in liberalised markets. The challenge is to 
set rates that strike a socially acceptable balance between the interests of investors and consumers, 
attracting needed capital while ensuring that prices are just and reasonable. Second, governments put in 
place policies to ensure access and affordability of services to poor or unserved populations. In some cases 
(e.g. telecommunications) liberalisation itself can increase access as competition lowers prices; in other 
cases, specific measures are necessary, such as network expansion obligations or subsidies targeted at poor 
consumers or at providers. Third, governments maintain responsibility for setting standards for the service, 
either specifying outcomes (e.g. service quality and reliability) or inputs (e.g. materials and design to be 
used by operators). Approaches to induce companies to meet standards range from mandatory service 
obligations to market-based instruments. Standards should be sufficiently flexible to enable operators to 
seek creative approaches to expand service provision, without compromising service quality. Furthermore, strong and genuinely independent regulatory agencies and competition authorities, with 
the capacity to put in place appropriate regulation and competition policy as well as ensure enforcement 
are critical. The essential tasks performed by these institutions require considerable expertise in appraising 
the structure and performance of markets. Development of regulatory capacity in developing countries is 
likely to require substantial technical and financial assistance. Transparency in regulatory decision-making 
and in activities between suppliers is also key to ensure accountability and the political acceptability of 
reform. Evidence suggests that consumers are prepared to accept higher prices where service quality is 
improved and the basis for the tariffs is transparent. Making information available to consumers can in turn 
assist in mobilising them to play a role in monitoring the performance of service suppliers and the 
enforcement of regulation. There is, of course, no universally appropriate model for reform. Every liberalisation programme must 
take account of each sector's economic attributes and technological conditions, as well as the country's TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 5 economic, social, geographical, institutional and political characteristics. Against this backdrop, Part I of 
the report presents concrete examples from both OECD and non-OECD countries of experiences by 
governments with various regulatory instruments to ensure public policy objectives. Part II of the study complements Part I by linking the discussion of the liberalisation of network 
infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main issues related to these 
services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in light of real 
liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these services. Enhanced GATS commitments in network infrastructure services can create momentum for further 
domestic reform, and can anchor these reforms within an international legal framework. GATS 
commitments can also provide a credible signal that the government is committed to sector reform and has 
taken the necessary legal and regulatory measures to allow for investment, including FDI. WTO 
commitments can thus contribute to improve the investment climate, helping to attract needed capital as 
well as technical and managerial expertise. Preparedness to make GATS commitments can additionally 
enhance leverage for commitments from trading partners both in services and in other areas of the WTO 
agenda. Notwithstanding these benefits, with the exception of telecommunication services, progress on 
committing network infrastructure services under the GATS has been limited. This partly reflects the fact 
that these services were mostly provided by public monopoly operators at the time of the Uruguay Round. 
Nevertheless, significant reforms to introduce competition have since been undertaken which have changed 
the market characteristics of these services in many countries. So there seems to be scope now to achieve 
more progress at the multilateral level and the Doha Round offers WTO Members an opportunity for 
anchoring recent policy reforms, giving them more permanency in a flexible and progressive manner. Yet 
so far only relatively few Members have tabled new or improved offers in these services and developing 
countries' participation remains limited. Part of the reason explaining this lack of progress relates to the main classification instruments used 
by WTO Members in making commitments in network infrastructure services. Clarifying and modernising 
the current GATS classifications is viewed by some countries as key to improve commitments in these 
services. Several proposals have thus been submitted by a number of WTO Members suggesting 
alternative or more specific definitions, some of which have already been adopted in the requests and 
offers of a few Members. While in light of divergent views it may be difficult in the short-term to agree on 
new classification instruments, WTO Members are not required to use any particular classification and the 
Members concerned are free to modify the classifications contained in their schedules of commitments (as 
long as consistency with previous commitments is maintained). By the same token, those Members that 
consider that the current GATS classifications remain a valid framework to schedule commitments in the 
relevant sectors can simply maintain them in their schedules. WTO Members have also been discussing 
ways to ensure that any commitments in these services are not undermined by lack of commitments in 
other (related) sectors. Perhaps more importantly, concerns have been raised about the potential effect of the GATS on the 
ability of governments to ensure adequate provision of network infrastructure services to the public. In 
practice, this refers to the possible impact of the Agreement on governments' ability to maintain their 
traditional public service responsibilities either through monopoly public utilities, exclusive rights to 
provide services or appropriately regulated competition. In light of the importance of these services for 
society and their highly regulated nature, governments have been cautious about agreeing to subject these 
sectors to binding commitments on competitive supply. The GATS, like other legally bound undertakings 
in the WTO (or other international treaties), can affect the regulatory conduct of governments. At the same 
time, the Agreement affords WTO Members considerable flexibility in this regard. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 6 In the absence of scheduled commitments, the GATS imposes only limited obligations, which do not 
limit governments' ability to retain control over network infrastructure services. When a country makes a 
commitment, other more significant obligations kick-in, especially concerning market access and national 
treatment. These may have more significant implications on autonomous policy making in these services, 
intensified by the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to 
be tested in practice. Scheduling commitments on network infrastructure services thus raises questions in 
relation to their nature. At the same time, the flexibility imbedded in the Agreement allows countries to 
schedule limitations to avoid these concerns and facilitate the assumption of commitments in these 
services. This is reflected in the Uruguay Round schedules of some WTO Members and explored in Part II 
of the study. Once commitments in a particular sector have been made, additional disciplines on regulatory 
measures apply, in particular those contained in Article VI. A closer look at these provisions reveals that 
they do not seem to impinge on governments' ability to regulate network infrastructure services. In 
addition, current discussions under the Article VI:4 mandate indicate that any new disciplines in this area 
will be broad enough to allow regulation for the protection of a wide range of public policy objectives. 
This is confirmed by the Accountancy Disciplines, the one area where negotiations have been concluded 
under the mandate. Another important example of GATS disciplines and the scope for autonomous policy 
making in network infrastructure services is the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications. The 
Reference Paper, which attains legal status only to the extent that WTO Members have incorporated it in 
their commitments, consists of a set of pro-competitive regulatory principles for basic telecommunication 
services akin to international best practice. The Reference Paper, in line with the Preamble of the GATS, 
recognises governments' right to regulate the sector to ensure public policy objectives. A case in point is 
universal service requirements; the Reference Paper explicitly confirms the right of Members to establish 
such measures. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 7 PART I: REGULATING FOR PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES I. 
Introduction 1. 
This part of the study investigates how regulatory objectives can be achieved in liberalised 
markets by exploring experience with competition in several services sectors previously provided solely by 
governments. The aim is not to advocate particular solutions, but to provide policy makers with 
information to feed into, and adapt to the specificities of, their own economic and political situations, if 
and when they decide to liberalise. 2. 
The study presents concrete examples from both OECD and non-OECD countries of how 
governments have used various regulatory instruments to achieve public policy objectives. The focus is on 
telecommunication, postal/courier, energy and environmental infrastructure services given their network 
characteristics. 3. 
The report also includes examples where experience was not positive, with the aim of providing 
some guidance on the pitfalls to be avoided if the benefits of liberalisation are to be realised and sustained. 
A number of cases provide examples of both negative and positive experiences, with initial, less successful 
reforms being adjusted in light of experience and new regulatory solutions adopted. These cases underline 
both the extent of experimentation undertaken in service sector reform in recent years and the need for 
regulatory approaches to be adapted to local circumstances. 4. 
Examples of regulation of domestic private participants, i.e. where there is no trade, are included 
where there is no apparent reason that the same regulatory measure could not be applied to a foreign 
entrant. Examples of regulatory mechanisms involving publicly-owned companies are incorporated as well 
when they are relevant for any type of operator (public or private). Reforms have at times been progressive 
with the former public monopoly still being the main (or only) service provider, while the new regulatory 
framework is designed. In these cases, the reforms have already been tailored to prepare for the 
introduction of competition. 5. 
The next section of this part of the study reviews opportunities and challenges of introducing 
competition in network infrastructure services. Section III then identifies a number of key regulatory 
objectives that governments seek to achieve in liberalised markets to address market failures and meet 
public policy objectives, and describes some of the regulatory approaches that can be used to achieve these 
objectives. The last section presents the country examples in the chosen sectors. II. 
Opening to competition 6. 
Historically, trade in network infrastructure services — including telecommunications, 
postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — has been limited because they were mainly provided by 
governments. Government provision was seen as necessary to ensure equitable access to these services and 
because of their natural monopoly characteristics. The scope for competition in several network 
infrastructure services has traditionally been limited given that the existing infrastructure — e.g. 
transmission media in telecommunications, electricity grid and water and sewage pipes — is often 
prohibitively expensive to duplicate. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 8 7. 
Nevertheless, in recent years trade in network infrastructure services has increased, following 
changes in the provision of these services leading to stronger presence of the private sector. In emerging 
economies and developing countries, in particular, the underlying driver of decisions to liberalise is to 
attract resources for the financing of investment and to improve infrastructure performance. Liberalisation 
of these services is seen as a way to increase investment and service coverage, foster competition where 
feasible and import technology and know-how. Due to lack of domestic capacity and finance, when 
developing country governments decide to liberalise, it usually includes a decision to accept foreign 
participation. 8. 
Competition in network utilities has also been facilitated by technological innovation. Changes in 
production and technological advances have had especially dramatic effects on the market structure of the 
telecommunication, energy and increasingly postal industries. In telecommunications, technological 
change has almost eliminated natural monopoly in interexchange markets (e.g. long-distance services). The 
rapid growth of cellular telephones, which increasingly substitute for wireline services, has played a big 
role in reducing the importance of scale and natural monopoly associated with conventional local loops 
(World Bank, 2004). Internet-based services are undergoing similar dramatic growth. 9. 
In recent years, what once was a relatively clear cut divide between the monopoly provision of 
postal services and competitive provision of courier services has become increasingly blurred. In a few 
cases, this has occurred through market reforms which have formally reduced or terminated the scope of 
monopoly rights, but for most countries this has been through the expansion of private sector operators into 
areas once the exclusive preserve of the public service postal providers. Equally, many postal 
administrations have moved beyond the confines of providing traditional postal services in reserved sectors 
into new areas in competition with the private sector. This process of increased competition has accelerated 
with new technological developments in postal services, with the range of possibilities opened up 
considerably through electronic mail and the Internet. 10. 
In the electricity industry reforms involved unbundling of its four main components — 
generation, transmission, distribution and retail — which led to different forms of competition (see Box 1). 
New technologies have also facilitated the introduction of competition in generation (although there is 
debate on whether the production of energy constitutes a service or a good). Low-cost, small-scale 
generation units allow electric power to be produced closer to end users, reducing reliance on transmission 
and distribution networks, which constitute services, and contributing to undermine their natural monopoly 
characteristics. Box 1. Options for restructuring electricity markets Electricity markets can be structured in four ways, reflecting varying competition and customer choice: @BULLET Monopoly — the traditional status quo, where a single entity generates all electricity and delivers it over a 
transmission network to distribution companies or costumers. @BULLET Single buyer — where a single agency buys electricity from competing generators, has a monopoly on 
transmission, and sells electricity to distributors and large power users without competition from other suppliers. @BULLET Wholesale competition — where multiple distributors buy electricity from competing generators, use the 
transmission network to deliver it to their service areas under open access arrangements, and maintain monopolies 
on sales in their service areas. @BULLET Retail competition — where customers have access to competing generators, directly or through a retailer of their 
choice, and transmission and distribution networks operate under open access arrangements. However, retail 
competition may not involve all customers but may be limited to industrial customers. Source: World Bank, 2004. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 9 11. 
But even when competition in the market may not be feasible — e.g. local networks of water 
pipes and sewers — it is possible to introduce competition for the market through monopoly franchises. 
Many countries have used innovative strategies to facilitate private participation in these services. 
Contractual arrangements between the private and public sectors, such as concessions, management 
contracts or build operate transfer contracts have emerged as alternatives to privatisation — where 
ownership is transferred through outright divesture. 1 A concession contract, for example, grants a private 
company, typically through competitive bidding, the exclusive right to provide a service for a specified 
period by using existing facilities and developing new ones. Thus, a concession agreement entails only a 
temporary transfer of the infrastructure assets (such as water pipes) to the private sector. At the end of the 
concession period the assets are transferred back to the public authority (World Bank, 2004). 12. 
These changes are having the effect of gradually bringing network infrastructure services into the 
realm of the market and exposing them to international trade. However, although the benefits of 
liberalisation can be very important both in terms of increased efficiency and of service access and 
affordability, past experience has shown that reforms must be appropriately designed and supported by a 
strong regulatory framework. 13. 
If a government decides to introduce competition in services previously provided solely by the 
public sector, it needs to shift from being the manager of these services to being their regulator. In light of 
the characteristics of these services, to achieve public policy objectives in the new environment, new 
regulatory tools and approaches are required, including with respect to pricing, universal access (both in 
terms of availability and affordability) and service standards. 14. 
Another important dimension is the establishment of strong and genuinely independent 
regulatory agencies and competition authorities, with the capacity to put in place appropriate regulation 
and ensure enforcement. When these exist, private participation can lead to improvements in attaining 
public policy objectives, because, for instance, government agencies may be reluctant to monitor and fine 
(other) government providers — a classic conflict of interests. Transparency about government choices 
(and reasons underlying them) and in activities between suppliers is also key, as is the introduction of 
instruments to enhance consumers' involvement in monitoring and evaluating the improvement of services 
and the achievement of public policy objectives. 15. 
Experience has shown that there is no universally appropriate model for reform. Every 
liberalisation programme must take account of each sector's features, including its economic attributes and 
technological conditions, as well as the country's economic, social, geographical, institutional and political 
characteristics (World Bank, 2004). Furthermore, the elaboration of adequate regulatory instruments and 
the establishment of institutions can be costly and may require sophisticated skills, and thus present 
challenges that are likely to be most acute in emerging economies and developing countries. Provision of 
technical assistance and capacity building to support liberalisation are thus particularly important for these 
countries. III. 
Regulatory goals and approaches Regulating tariffs 16. 
Unlike for telecommunication services where trade liberalisation, coupled with technological 
advances, has led to significant price decreases, private-sector involvement in water, sewage, electricity 
and postal services can lead to increases in existing fees for service supplied by the government. This is 1 There is debate among WTO Members on to what extent such contracts represent a form government procurement, 
see Part II. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 10 because often the price fixed under government monopoly does not even cover the cost of providing the 
service. User-fees are one of the most controversial aspects of liberalisation, especially in environmental 
network services and electricity. Network infrastructure services are capital-intensive services and 
wherever that capital investment comes from, somebody has to pay for it: if not users then taxpayers or aid 
donors. Providing water and sewage services  " free "  to end users, for example, ignores the huge costs of 
collecting, storing and distributing water, as well as treating waste water. Cost-reflective tariffs are needed 
to bring about the investment necessary to maintain, replace, modernise and expand the facilities and 
services. User fees for water, and for water-waste management, are also crucial to the promotion of 
conservation principles in user households and commercial enterprises (OECD, 2001). 17. 
A decision to liberalise these services does not of course mean the end of regulation in this 
fundamental regulatory sphere — governments retain a key role in regulating tariffs. The key challenge 
relates to setting rates that strike a socially acceptable balance between the interests of investors and 
consumers, attracting needed capital and ensuring that tariffs are just and reasonable, and contribute to 
universal service objectives. These goals are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Practical regulation may 
entail trade-offs among them and lead to different incentives for economic actors. The optimal choice of 
regulatory mechanisms depends on several factors related to the stage of national development, including 
the sector's investment requirements, the availability of technical expertise and the quality of accounting 
and auditing systems (see Box 2). Box 2. Mechanisms for regulating tariffs Two alternative mechanisms for tariff regulation are cost-plus and price caps. 
2 Under cost-plus regulation, the operator 
submits a bill for its operating expenses and capital costs (depreciation plus an after-tax return on its investment that 
equals or exceeds its cost of capital) and the regulator passes on these costs in the prices charged to consumers. One 
of the attractions of cost-plus regulation is that it is likely to attract investment to a regulated sector because investors 
know they will recover their operating and investment costs. However, cost-plus systems may create incentives to 
engage in accounting contrivances and to inflate costs to convince the regulator to approve higher prices. Equally, 
these systems may distort firms' incentives to minimise costs because firms are not rewarded for reducing them. Under price caps the regulator defines a set of prices that the operator will be allowed to charge. The utility is free to 
price at or below these ceilings, and thus has a strong incentive to pursue cost-reducing innovation, use the lowest-
cost technology and operate with no waste. At the same time, consumers are protected because prices do not vary 
with the firm's reported costs. However, a disadvantage of price caps is the risk of under capitalisation that may lead to 
quality concerns. In addition, it is hard to assess future developments in the utility's productivity and there is therefore a 
risk of excessive profits or losses. It is thus standard for a price cap mechanism to be reviewed, which may lead to 
price adjustments if the rate of return falls outside a given range. In practice, most schemes have tended to be hybrid schemes, with the aim of sharing benefits and burdens between 
the utility and its customers. For example, under some profit sharing mechanisms the firm is allowed to keep all profits 
as long as the rate of return (revenue) falls within a specified range, thereby retaining incentives to achieve cost 
efficiency. But if the rate of return falls outside this range, consumers receive a portion of the gains (or loss). Source: World Bank, 2004; and Reineke and Schmitz, 2000. 18. 
It is important to note that often poor consumers are simply left out of network services, 
including in the case of services being provided by a government monopoly. This typically results in the 
poor paying much more for these services than the better off. In the water supply sector, for example, the 
cost per litre of drinking water in Nairobi is 10 times more for customers of vendors than it is for those 
who are connected to a network. The ratios are similar in Latin America or even higher in the Caribbean 
region. Paradoxically, this gives some ground for optimism. The regrettable fact that the urban poor are 2 It should be noted that in some sectors, such as telecommunications, regulated prices are often asymmetrical as they 
only apply to incumbents or major suppliers. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 11 used to pay very high unit prices suggests that there are resources available in the current expenditure of 
poor consumers that could be channelled more efficiently (Simpson, forthcoming). Regulating to achieve universal access 19. 
In addition to introducing cost-reflective tariffs necessary to attract needed investment, 
governments should put in place policies that help to meet the needs of those parts of the population, often 
in poor periurban or geographically remote areas, who cannot afford to pay for network infrastructure 
services. Allowing entry — particularly in sectors or segments where product competition is feasible, e.g. 
telecommunication services — can itself increase services for the poor or unserved populations, as 
competition introduces a range of price and quality options making service possible in outlying regions and 
to populations at lower income levels. The introduction of competition in mobile telephones has 
significantly reduced the universal access problem for the urban poor in many developing countries and 
has also had a considerable impact on low-income users in rural areas (ITU, 2003). Similarly, the 
expansion of private sector operators into areas previously reserved to the public postal monopoly has 
considerably improved mail and parcel delivery in several countries. 20. 
In general, though, private companies must invest responsibly and therefore cannot alone be 
expected to meet the needs of the poor or unserved population. Private actors, if free to choose, would 
naturally seek profitable networks and most likely invest in utilities serving the cities and large urban areas. 
However, meeting unmet needs should be a priority for governments — indeed, attracting the needed 
resources is often the key motivation for introducing competition in the first place — so tools for inducing 
the private sector to invest in coverage in low-income areas should be an integral part of any reform 
programme. A common measure to extend access to service is to include network expansion obligations in 
contracts with private providers (Gleick et al., 2002). As for pricing, the incentives for investors and 
consumers have to be right, and contracts need to encourage flexible and innovative approaches to meet 
service targets. 21. 
Governments also have used various forms of subsidies and other support to protect poorer or 
unserved groups within society. With the introduction of competition, direct (non-tariff) subsidies to poor 
consumers have often replaced cross-subsidies. 3 Rather than providing blanket subsidies to hold tariffs 
down, a policy that generally benefits the middle classes who are connected to the network, governments 
have established mechanisms to direct the subsidies to poor neighbourhoods and unserved populations. 
Other mechanisms have been used to promote sustainable use of natural resources while fostering service 
access by the poor. In the water sector, these schemes consist in providing a basic minimum quantity of 
water free or at low cost, but imposing higher charges for greater consumption. A key challenge, however, 
is to target poor people accurately. Thus, these mechanisms require strong administrative capacity. 22. 
Direct subsidies can additionally be targeted at operators in order to create incentives to extend 
access into otherwise unprofitable areas. In telecommunication services, for example, so-called 
universality funds have been established to collect revenues from various sources, including government 
budgets, charges on international connecting services or levies on all telecommunication service operators. 
Universality funds are generally used to finance specific and targeted high cost areas or low income 
subscribers. They provide subsidies to create incentives for private sector telecommunication operators to 
serve areas that otherwise would be unprofitable (Intven and Tétrault, 2000). 3 Cross-subsidisation occurs when, for example, the utility charges high-income and low-cost customers prices above 
costs to finance services to low-income and high-cost consumers, who pay prices below costs. For example, in 
telecommunications the provider charges low rates for local calls and higher rates for domestic and international long-
distance calls. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 12 Regulating to meet service standards 23. 
Government responsibility extends beyond ensuring availability of service at an affordable price. 
Service standards in network infrastructure services have emerged as a major regulatory issue, not least 
because many functions of modern society critically depend on these services. Standards may specify 
outcomes, including with respect to service quality, service reliability and continuity, environmental effects 
and customer relations. In the water supply sector, quality standards are crucial to address long-term 
(chronic) health problems associated with high levels of pollutants. In the postal/courier sector, service 
quality in terms of on-time delivery of letters and parcels and reliability (ensuring that letters are indeed 
delivered) are very important. In electricity (as in water and telecommunications), continuity of service 
(avoiding blackouts and brownouts) is a main issue. The need to address environmental effects caused by 
market externalities, e.g. controlling energy and water resources, is also critical. Customer relations, e.g. 
flexibility in payment methods, is an important aspect for all network infrastructure services, and can 
contribute to meeting universal access objectives. Standards may also specify inputs, including with 
respect to materials and design to be used by operators, and procedures (e.g. documents required from the 
operator and users for service connection applications) (Komives, 1999). 24. 
Private operators may have few economic incentives to ensure appropriate service standards. 
Therefore, service standards need to be incorporated in the regulation of the utilities. There exist a number 
of approaches to induce companies to meet standards, ranging from mandatory service obligations to 
market-based instruments. Under mandatory service obligations, the regulator sets standards that the 
operators must meet or otherwise face fines or even the cancellation of the contract. These schemes entail 
broader social benefits by ensuring that consumers are protected through guaranteed standards of 
performance. 25. 
Market-based instruments, on the other hand, aim at providing incentives to companies to meet 
targets through improvements in efficiency. One case in point is the so called quality-incorporated 
benchmarking. For example, under price cap regulation, a company that delivers increased quality relative 
to its peers would be allowed to raise its price, while a corresponding price reduction would be imposed on 
under-performing companies. Moreover, these schemes aim to introduce the dynamic benefits of 
competition to quality provision. By using benchmarking, regulated firms effectively compete against each 
other to deliver at an optimal mix of cost and service quality. Thus, in addition to static gains maximisation 
(through improving the quality of service above a certain threshold), firms face an incentive to pursue 
long-term investments that reduce the cost of quality provision (Giannakis, Jamasb, and Pollitt, 2003). 26. 
Particularly in developing countries where large shares of the population do not have access to 
services, countries are introducing flexible regulation that provides the strongest incentives for the operator 
to seek creative approaches to meet service standards, while ensuring that important public policy 
objectives, e.g. water quality, are not compromised (World Bank, 2004). Effective regulatory agencies and competition authorities 27. 
The establishment of appropriate regulatory agencies and competition authorities designed to 
signal government's commitment to potential private investors and protect consumers from exploitation 
are essential to the reform process. In a natural monopoly situation, as is generally the case for water and 
sewage, private participation does not for the most part lead to a competitive market, but to the 
replacement of a public monopoly with a private one. Regulatory agencies and competition authorities thus 
need to ensure that the interests of consumers are defended against potential abuses from a private 
enterprise operating in a non-competitive environment. The crucial tasks performed by these institutions — 
e.g. setting tariffs and quality standards, as well as ensuring enforcement — require considerable expertise 
in appraising the structure and performance of markets. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 13 28. 
Another key issue relates to ensuring access to bottleneck facilities, e.g. the local loop in 
telecommunication services and the transmission grid in electricity. These facilities are essential in 
delivering final products and are often too costly to duplicate. Regulatory agencies and competition 
authorities have the difficult task of designing appropriate access rules, without which entry in these 
industries will not materialise. Access prices for interconnection need to be high enough to compensate for 
the use of the network, yet not so high as to preclude efficient operations by entrants. The goal of access 
policy should be that competition in final service markets is efficient and does not favour owners of 
bottleneck facilities or their rivals (World Bank, 2004). 29. 
Furthermore, particularly in sectors that feature competitive segments, such as 
telecommunication, energy and postal/courier services, regulatory agencies and competition authorities 
need to develop the capacity to identify abuses of market power and provide remedies that help to retain 
competition as the main governor of industry performance. This includes prohibiting anti-competitive 
behaviour, such as price fixing or tactics that hinder third-party access to essential facilities, as well as 
blocking or conditioning mergers and acquisitions deemed damaging to competition. 30. 
Performing all these tasks effectively also requires that regulatory agencies and competition 
authorities be largely independent from political influence. At the same time, it is important to ensure that 
regulators do not become corrupt or inefficient. Citizens and firms should be able to find out who makes 
regulatory decisions and what guides them, and to voice their concerns. In addition, affected parties should 
be able to obtain redress if a regulator acts arbitrarily or incompetently (World Bank, 2004). 31. 
Many transition economies and developing countries still lack adequate regulatory agencies and 
competition authorities, which can be costly and require sophisticated skills. Some have yet to implement 
the basic elements of competition law, let alone complex issues such as fair access rules. Development of 
regulatory capacity in these countries thus requires substantial technical and financial assistance. Transparency and users' involvement 32. 
There is evidence that even people with low incomes are willing to pay for network infrastructure 
services when the services are reliable and the cost of delivering them is reasonably transparent and 
understandable. Experience also suggests that people and businesses will pay more when they receive new 
or improved services. In the context of reform, this suggests that dissemination of detailed information 
about the improvement in services, and the capital investment needed to create these improvements, is 
essential for public acceptance of increases in overall prices. The new or improved services need to be 
clearly described and rate changes need to be phased in, together with strong education and information 
programmes describing the changes and their reasons. Phasing in price increases allows people and 
businesses to adjust to price changes if the schedule of change is communicated in advance and people 
believe that it will actually be implemented (Gleick et al., 2002). 33. 
Making information available to consumers can in turn assist in mobilising them to play a role in 
monitoring the performance of service suppliers and the enforcement of regulation. A number of 
instruments have been introduced to enhance consumers' participation in regulation. So-called citizen 
report cards have been used to survey the opinion of consumers in relation to service provision and their 
interaction with the relevant public agencies. Citizens can provide useful feedback on the quality, 
efficiency and adequacy of services and the problems they face in their interaction with service providers 
(Paul, 2004). Other measures include community-based monitoring and evaluation, designed either by the 
community groups themselves or by government agencies. 34. 
Ensuring availability of information is also key with respect to activities between suppliers. In the 
telecommunications sector, for example, transparency is important in relation to public licensing criteria, TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 14 universal service obligations, the allocation of scarce resources, interconnection rates, reference 
interconnection offers and interconnection agreements. IV. 
Examples of regulatory approaches and outcomes in liberalised markets Regulating tariffs Pricing of electricity distribution in the UK 35. 
The UK electricity sector has more than a decade of experience with incentive-based mechanisms 
governing its electricity utilities. In 1990, the former publicly-owned monopoly on electricity distribution 
was divided in 12 Regional Electric Companies (REC). The RECs held a local monopoly on distribution 
and were allowed to generate up to 15% of their power (and purchase the rest from generating companies). 
The RECs also collectively owned the National Grid, a company in charge of transmission. An Office of 
Electricity Regulation (OFFER) was in parallel established and one of its missions was to implement a 
price cap regulation based on the RPI-X formula. 4 36. 
The main cost categories used by the regulator to set the price cap are the operating expenditures 
(Opex), which cover the costs of network operation, and the capital expenditures (Capex), which refer to 
spending on long-term assets (e.g. lines and transformers). The incentive-based mechanism determines 
efficiency levels of Opex by benchmarking the utilities' operating costs (deducing some non-controllable 
costs such as transmission system charges and asset depreciation) with respect to a combination of factors 
comprising customer numbers, units of energy delivered and network length. Capex is regulated by using 
forecasts of expenditure for quality improvement for customers and other factors. Inefficient firms are 
required to reduce costs to meet set targets. These mechanisms contributed to a fall of operating costs in 
real terms by nearly 30% between 1990 and 2002, encouraged new investment in the network, and 
increased network reliability. 37. 
Nevertheless, for the first three years, tariffs for distribution operations were loosely capped in 
order to let companies generate capital to improve their facilities. The result was high profits for the RECs, 
which at the beginning achieved the fund raising objective for the improvement of the network. However, 
at a subsequent stage these profits, and the resulting high prices for consumers, became increasingly 
controversial, particularly in light of decreasing costs for operators. To address these concerns, OFFER 
required significant price reductions averaging at 14% for 1995/96 and 12% for 1996/97, and readjusted 
the price cap for the following years. Recent research also points to the rising concentration of the industry, 
which may raise competition policy concerns. Source: Giannakis, Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003; Kwoka, 1997; and Thomas, 2004. Selected aspects of the California electricity crisis 38. 
In June 2000, California's electricity prices experienced an unprecedented level of volatility and 
price increases, driven by the threat of supply shortages and a series of  " rolling black-outs "  that affected 
millions of users. The situation led to bankruptcy of one distribution utility as well as considerable political 
turmoil. Among the reasons commonly associated with the California electricity crisis, the particular 
process of restructuring the California electricity sector has been identified as being a key factor. This 
crisis underlines the need for the objectives and constraints of any reform effort to be clearly identified. 4 The RPI-X formula means that the price cap can increase each year by the Retail Price Index (RPI) minus a certain 
percentage X which reflects the productivity gains expected from the operators. The higher is X, the greater the 
incentive for utilities to reduce costs and be more efficient and the lower the price for consumers. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 15 39. 
For instance, any transition from a vertically integrated utility to an unbundled structure 
introduces price risks between generators and distributors that previously did not exist. High wholesale 
prices for generators gives profits that are matched by losses of distributors who have to buy at these high 
prices and sell at predetermined retail prices. The transition to an unbundled industry therefore needs 
contracts and hedging instruments to insure against possible unexpected events that can have dramatic 
effects on wholesale prices. In California, when approximately 20,000 MW of generation capacity were 
sold to five new entrants, commitments were not required from the generators to sell a large fraction of the 
expected annual output as a long-term contract to the three main utility distributors. 40. 
Further, tight demand with low spare capacity (and inelastic supply) may lead to volatile markets 
and high prices even if there is competition among generators. As demand tightens relative to supply in the 
face of inelastic and unresponsive demand 5 , large price rises have little effect on demand. At the same 
time, each generator has increasing market power. The relatively large price increase caused by any single 
company withdrawing a small amount of capacity is more than sufficient to compensate for the loss of 
profit on that volume of sales, making such withdrawals highly profitable. 41. 
The case also shows the importance of establishing strong regulatory agencies with broad powers 
to intervene, and which are not fragmented among jurisdictions. The responsibilities of these agencies 
would include resource planning, oversight of competitive generation markets, distribution and 
transmission prices, network access and service standards. Source: Wolak and Nordhaus 2001; Wolak, 2003; and Institute of International Education, 2002. Difficulties to establish sound regulation to electricity tariff-setting in Zimbabwe 42. 
In 1991, the Government of Zimbabwe introduced a reform programme of the electricity sector. 
This included a performance improvement programme (PIP) for the national state utility responsible for 
the bulk of electricity generation, transmission and distribution — the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply 
Authority (ZESA). It also initiated a legal and regulatory reform framework for the electricity sector in 
general. The Government and the Board of ZESA initiated the PIP with the appointment of a new Chief 
Executive in December 1992, placing the latter and all senior managers on a performance contract. 
Concurrently, Electricité de France (EDF) was engaged to work with the new management team to develop 
a programme to improve the performance of the organisation in the key areas of technical operations, 
customer service, financial performance and human resources management. Subsequently, several 
programmes were developed between 1993 and 2000 which set performance targets, including with respect 
to profitability to enhance investment, quality standards and customer satisfaction. 43. 
Profitability objectives were crucial to bring about much need investment and extend electricity 
access to rural areas. One of the key strategies to improve revenues was to seek Government approval for 
cost-reflective tariffs. However, a lack of policy commitment and often change of Ministers for Energy — 
e.g. between early 2000 and 2002 there were three Ministers for Energy — resulted in a failure to 
implement the legal and regulatory framework to underpin the reform. Indeed, the reluctance of the 
Government to establish sound regulation to progressively raise tariffs to cost-recovery levels meant that 
cash flow and profitability remained below targets. Tariffs were only adjusted in response to an actual 
financial crisis, which was reflected in the constant liquidity problems, which ZESA faced over the years. 
Financial deficits were funded through short-term borrowings. When tariff increases were granted, 
profitability recovered almost overnight but for the cash flows it took several months to recover because of 
the heavy short-term debts. With this ad hoc tariff setting approach, getting approvals for tariffs that reflect 5 If consumers face prices unrelated to wholesale prices, they will not reduce demand even if wholesale prices 
increase dramatically. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 16 prospective investment costs proved impossible. ZESA, therefore, failed to expand generation, negatively 
impacting the rural electrification expansion programme. Source: Mangwengwende, 2002. Tariff policy in the Chilean water and sewage sectors 44. 
Chile introduced a new tariff formula in its water and sewage sectors gradually from 1990 to 
1995, when it reformed its publicly-owned Santiago Metropolitan Sanitary Works Enterprise (Empresa 
Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias, or EMOS) by means of a regulatory framework mimicking the design 
of a concession with a private utility. EMOS was still a state-owned company but started to operate under 
private law (privatisation ultimately occurred in 1999) and under the supervision of an independent 
regulatory agency. 45. 
The tariff policy was designed both to signal to potential private investors that the government 
was committed to not expropriating their return-on-capital through under-pricing and to curtail the chance 
of monopoly rents. Tariffs are calculated every five years to cover the long run marginal cost 6 of a  " model "  
or benchmark company, and then readjusted to permit a  " reasonable "  return on assets (allowing at least a 
seven percent return on capital). The water tariff is also indexed to a price index. To reduce the risk of 
monopoly rents, the construction of the model company was a black box in order to make it harder for the 
company to manipulate the information. The tariff has thus incentive properties similar to a price cap. If 
EMOS can be more efficient than the model, it earns additional profits, giving the company an incentive to 
maximise its efficiency. At the end of the period, tariffs may be adjusted downward to force the company 
to share its gains with consumers. 46. 
The reforms led to significant gains to the government through taxes and dividends, while 
consumers benefited from almost 100% coverage of expanding demand, better water pressure and fewer 
interruptions of services. Consumers also had to pay higher prices, but the effects were ameliorated by 
direct subsidies (see below). Employees gained from wages closer to market wages. Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000. High tariffs in two water and sewage concessions in Argentina 7 47. 
In 1995 private participation was introduced in the water and sewage sector in the province of 
Tucuman, Argentina. A 30 year concession contract was awarded to a consortium composed of Compagnie 
Générale des Eaux and a local investor. Aggressive investment targets were set in the contract. These had a 
major impact on prices, which rose by up to 68%. In addition, this rise was spread across all consumers 
equally, with serious implications for affordability by low income households. These concerns had not 
been foreseen and were not addressed early on in the reform process. The new tariff became very 
unpopular and public disapproval turned to resentment after outbreaks of turbid water. A non-payment 
campaign was organised and an anti-privatisation local government was elected. The financial situation of 
the concessionaire further deteriorated and several attempts to renegotiate the contract failed. A social tariff 
was then proposed but public confidence had been lost and the case ended in international arbitration. 6 The marginal cost is the change in total costs per unit change in output. Long run marginal cost (LRMC) is 
estimated over the  " long run " , i.e. that time period over which all costs are variable. It therefore comprises changes in 
both capital and operating costs. 7 The effects of Argentina's financial crisis, while important, are beyond the scope of this study. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 17 48. 
In May 1993, a 30 year concession contract was awarded to a private company to operate the 
water and sewage services in Buenos Aires. Those consumers who were already connected to the system 
initially benefited from a significant drop in tariffs and an improvement in the quality and reliability of 
service. Expansion targets set by geographical area, with poor areas prioritised, resulted in large numbers 
of new households being connected. However, an unpopular decision to pass the cost of system expansion 
on to new consumers in the form of a hefty infrastructure charge was one of the issues that lead to public 
unrest and early contract renegotiation. This very high connection charge, unaffordable for the poor, was 
replaced by a bimonthly Universal Service and Environmental Improvement fee (SUMA), which was 
levied on all customers regardless of when they connected to the network. Connection charges were 
reduced to US$ 120 for water or sewage, repayable over five-years in interest-free instalments averaging 
US$ 4 per month. Despite the fact that the changes resulted in a decrease in average bills in poor areas of 
74%, from US$61 to US$16, even at this level the rates remained unaffordable for the poor. In addition, 
the renegotiation saw a reduction in some of the targets for expansion, again to the detriment of the poor 
who are the primary residents of the unserved areas. Source: Estache, Gomez-Lobo and Leipziger, 2000; Haselip, 2004; and Zerah, Graham-Harrison and Brocklehurst, 
2001. Regulating to achieve universal access Universal access through a competitive mobile phone market and umbrella people in Nigeria 49. 
Nigeria is Africa's most populated nation with some 124 million inhabitants in 2002. Until 
August 2001, Nigeria had one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world. In February 2001, the 
government awarded three 15-year mobile cellular GSM licences for USD 285 million and the rise in the 
number of mobile subscribers has been very significant. By December 2001, there were close to 400 000 
GSM subscribers. The mobile operators managed to provide access to almost as many telephone 
subscribers in four months than had been installed via fixed lines in 40 years since independence (there 
were some 540 000 fixed lines at the end of December 2001). Growth has been relentless, reaching two 
million subscribers by March 2003. Mobile coverage was initially limited to Lagos, the largest city, and 
has now spread to 219 out of 550 local government areas. 50. 
Although handsets and prepaid cards are expensive, service is being extended to those who 
cannot afford a mobile handset and prepaid card through  " umbrella people " . These are resellers of GSM 
wireless service — most of them young women who have settled into the business of selling phone calls, 
earning a high level of financial independence in the process. Almost every Nigerian street is now 
decorated with umbrellas marking the stands operated by makeshift GSM resellers — thus giving these 
entrepreneurs their nickname. Critics of GSM services in Nigeria have pointed to high tariffs and sub-
standard services rendered by operators. At the same time, it is generally accepted that GSM has assumed 
an important role in providing universal access in Nigeria, while also appearing to give low-income 
Nigerians an avenue for gainful entrepreneurship. Source: ITU, 2003. Extending Chilean public telecommunication service to rural areas through market-based mechanisms 51. 
Although the Chilean telecommunications sector was the first in Latin America to be privatised 
and opened to competition, a significant part of the population was still unserved in the mid-1990s. The 
government created a Telecommunications Development Fund in 1994 financed by the national budget to 
encourage private investment in areas with low income and low telephone density. A council selected 
projects eligible for subsidies and granted licenses to private operators through competitive bidding. The 
bidder requiring the lowest one-time subsidy was awarded the license. Rural localities needing public TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 18 telephones were grouped into projects according to geographical proximity and technical solutions likely to 
be cost-effective, and the winning bidder had to commit to provide at least one public telephone in each 
locality, available everyday and twenty-four hours a day. 52. 
The Fund was very successful. Between 1995 and 2000 it supported the provision of payphone 
service to more than 6,000 rural localities with about 2.2 million inhabitants, thereby reducing the 
proportion of Chile's population living in places without access to basic voice communication from 15% in 
1994 to 1% in 2002. In addition, some 25,000 individual rural telephone lines were provided. The 
subsidies awarded cost the government less than 0.3% of total telecommunications sector revenue during 
the funding period, making it one of the most cost-effective telecommunications support programme 
world-wide, and Fund administration cost about 3% of the subsidies granted. Source: Intven, Oliver and Sepúlveda, 2000; and Wellenius, 2001. Extending access to telecommunication services to rural Peru 53. 
As part of the reforms which led to the introduction of competition in its telecommunications 
sector in the 1990s, Peru has established a subsidy programme, known as the Telecommunications 
Investment Fund (FITEL), to finance investment in telecommunication services in rural areas. (A rural area 
is mainly defined as a territory enclosing rural settlements of less than 100 housing units together or more 
than 100 dispersed or scattered units.) The Supervisory Authority for Private Investment in 
Telecommunications (OSIPTEL), the regulatory body for the sector, administers the fund and selects 
projects to be implemented, while the Ministry for Transport and Communications is responsible for 
approving them. The fund's assets come from a levy of 1 per cent on the turnover of companies. 54. 
The first stage of the programme involved a pilot project for installation of public telephones in 
the Frontera Norte (north frontier) area. The main objective of this pilot project was to gather knowledge of 
possible drawbacks that might arise with the launch of larger scale projects. The company Gilat To Home 
Perú S.A. (GTH) won the tender to offer the service in the 213 populated centres selected for the project. 
The licensing and financing contracts for the project were signed at the end of 1998, which opened the way 
to the full network installation by end 1999, the agreed delivery date. By mid-2001, the operator was 
providing a normal service. The first assessment of the project revealed that it was a success with regard to 
the use of public funds for the development of rural telephony, bringing services to the local populations 
which had previously been either non-existent or of difficult access. Public investment or subsidy per 
inhabitant came to USD 11, covering a total population of 144 522 inhabitants on the basis of an average 
investment per populated centre of USD 8 609. Nevertheless, the first assessment also highlighted some 
problems for local people, including with respect to non-availability in villages of pre-paid cards or long 
periods without service after equipment failure. A subsequent inspection revealed improvements carried 
out by GTH in response to comments made in the first report. Source: ITU, 2001a. Achieving universal access through competition and a universal service fund in the Guatemalan 
telecommunications sector 55. 
Until 1996, telecommunication services in Guatemala were provided by the state-owned 
monopoly, GUATEL. By the mid-1990s, there was growing dissatisfaction with the performance of 
GUATEL. Not only was the company comparatively inefficient (around 60 mainlines per 1,000 
employees), but it was failing to satisfy mounting demand for telecommunication services. In 1996, 
Guatemala had one of the lowest teledensity ratios in Latin America with only 4.2 (fixed plus cellular) 
lines per 100 inhabitants. With only 350,000 fixed telephone lines in the country, unsatisfied demand was 
estimated at 1,000,000 lines. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 19 56. 
The Telecommunications Law of 1996 (Decreto 94-96) paved the way for one of the most radical 
market liberalisations witnessed in the region, removing all barriers to competition. The 1996 law also 
created a new regulatory agency, the Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones (SIT). The reform involved 
privatisation of GUATEL, which was transformed into a new company TELGUA, of which 95% stakes 
were sold to the private sector via auction awarded to TELMEX — the Mexican leading 
telecommunications company which was formerly owned by the state and privatised in 1990. There are 
now more than 250 companies involved in providing the full range of telecommunication services in 
Guatemala. These include a number of major international investors such as Bell South, Telefónica, 
TELMEX and Millicom International. Although the local telephony market continues to be dominated by 
TELGUA, with 95% of all fixed line subscribers, sixteen other companies have entered the market. 57. 
An important consequence of liberalisation has been the need to rebalance call charges, to 
remove the cross-subsidy that previously existed from long distance to local calls. As a result, local call 
charges increased from $0.51 per month (for the basic subscription including 200 free minutes; equivalent 
to $0.003 per minute), to $5.64 per month (equivalent to $0.028 per minute). Even this, though, falls below 
the estimated economic cost of around $0.030 to $0.033 per minute. Competition for long distance services 
has been more vigorous, with fourteen players, of which four major ones. The combination of tariff-
rebalancing and competition has led to dramatic reductions in long distance charges, from US$1.50 per 
minute to the United States in 1996, to around US$0.30 per minute in 1998. More recently, charges have 
fallen to around US$0.15 per minute as a result of the introduction of the possibility of tele-selection of the 
long distance operator. 58. 
Mobile telephony service was also introduced through the awarding of four licenses. Calls are 
charged at around $0.14 per minute, with some calling plans costing less than $10 per month. Aided by the 
rapid expansion of cellular telephony, the overall teledensity index for Guatemala has risen almost fivefold 
from 4.2 to 19.7 over the period 1997/01. Although about half of the new cellular subscriptions are second 
telephones for the richest 20% of the population, they are also playing an important role in rural areas 
where they have become as common as fixed line telephones and have begun to be used to provide 
informal public telephone services. 59. 
The proceeds of the spectrum auctions held for mobile telephony services (up to an annual 
ceiling of US$5 million) were allocated to a special fund (FONDETEL) designed to support the expansion 
of public telephones in rural areas. In line with best practice in a number of other Latin American 
countries, FONDETEL bid out the construction and operation of public telephones to the private operator 
requesting the minimum subsidy. Between 1998/99, FONDETEL disbursed US$7.5 million of subsidies 
for the installation of some 1,600 public telephones. Each US$1 of subsidy leveraged between US$2-4 of 
private investment, so that the total subsidy cost per town was US$4,400. The network of formal public 
telephones in rural areas has increased by 80% and, as result, 50% of rural households now have a public 
telephone in their community, and 80% of rural households live within 6 kilometres (or about half an hour) 
of a public telephone. However, unfortunately, the revenues from spectrum auctions have recently been 
exhausted and no additional funding source has been identified for FONDETEL. Source: Foster and Araujo, 2004. Universal access through cellular phones in rural areas of Bangladesh 60. 
Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated and poorest countries. The country has 
one of the least developed telecommunication systems, with a teledensity rate of 2-3 fixed phone lines per 
1,000 people in 2000. The Bangladesh Telegraph and Telecom Board (BTTB) was the state monopoly 
providing telephone services until the country embarked in reforms of the sector at the beginning of the TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 20 90s. The reform programme opened the market to competition and awarded new licenses to private 
companies, including operating in the cellular phone market in 1996. 61. 
A pilot project by GrameenPhone, a cellular operator with a national license that is building and 
operating a rural phone network, is enabling rural village woman to resell cellular phone services within 
their villages in order to extend access to telecommunications to rural areas at affordable prices. The 
project is carried out by the not-for profit company Grameen Telecom and supported by its parent 
company Grameen Bank, a successful for-profit micro credit bank which is widely established in 
Bangladesh. GrameenPhone is a joint venture of Grameen Telecom (35 %), Norway's telephone company 
Telenor (51 %) and other stakeholders. The programme began operating in March 1997 and by November 
1999 there were 950 village phones providing telephone access to more than 65,000 people. The micro 
credit bank provides village woman entrepreneurs with credit in form of a lease to buy digital GSM cell 
phones from Grameen Telecom. The women re-sell phone calls and provide services for incoming and 
outgoing calls in their stores, at home, in the local market or elsewhere. The income of the woman 
operators consists of the difference between charges paid by customers and the amount billed to the 
operators by Grameen Telecom. 62. 
Early findings suggest that the programme has had considerable development benefits. It has 
reduced the cost of communications relative to other services such as transportation. It has boosted 
producers' returns by enabling village pay phone users to compare rural prices with city market prices, 
increasing their bargaining power. It also facilitated the flow of income between oversees workers or 
workers in urban cities and their families in rural villages. Finally, the programme has enabled the village 
pay phone entrepreneurs, poor by most standards but among the better-off in their villages, to turn a profit. 
Still, Grameen Telecom's rural development programme lags behind the targets. Its initial target was 
40,000 village pay phones installed by 2002, an average of 8,000 a year. But by the end of January 2000 it 
had installed only about 1,700. Source: Lawson and Meyenn, 2000; and Richardson, Ramirez and Haq, 2000. Universal access in postal and courier services in Guatemala through competition and private sector 
participation 63. 
Guatemala maintained a state monopoly for postal services until 1997. These services were 
provided by the Directorate of Post and Telegraph Services (DGCT), which operated under the Ministry of 
Communications, Transportation, and Public Works. The sector was characterised by poor and unreliable 
service, highly subsidised tariffs, under-paid staff and financial looses of US $2 million per year. In 
addition, DGCT was not able to ensure service to the geographically remote areas. Nevertheless, service 
roll-out was partly achieved by private companies. Indeed, despite the legally protected monopoly, private 
firms had been operating in the postal and courier market informally since the 1970s. These companies, 
ranging from very small to large international firms, like DHL, engaged in a variety of activities, including 
in-city messenger, in-country delivery, international courier, and international remittance transport. Most 
of the companies in the in-country market were operating regionally and for national coverage they were 
subcontracting each other, especially for coverage in remote areas. The private service companies were 
more expensive than DGCT (although competition helped bringing down prices), yet they reached remote 
villages in the country. 64. 
The competition (and better performance) by private companies lead the Government to proceed 
with plans to modernise and introduce private-sector participation in the public operator. In 1997, a five 
year management contract was awarded to International Post Services (IPS), a subsidiary of Canada Post, 
to improve postal service and ensure an acceptable level of universal service for the entire country. The 
programme included a Government subsidy paid to the operator to keep tariffs down and ensure universal TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 21 service. The programme resulted in an increase of the number of access points and there were also 
significant improvements in service quality, including in terms of reductions in mail processing, transit and 
delivery times. The subsidy was still high, but lower than before the management contract. The resulting 
enhanced sector performance has provided an incentive for the Government to award a ten year concession 
contract for service provision to IPS. Source: De Rodriguez, 1998; and World Bank, 2003. Subsidies for power benefiting the non-poor in Guatemala 65. 
In 1996, Guatemala reformed its energy sector and unbundled the generation, transmission and 
distribution of electricity. The project included the privatisation of state-owned assets and regulated 
concessions for distribution companies. A social tariff was created to subsidise the consumption of 
electricity for poor households. In 2000, tariffs were capped at USD 0.08 per kWh for all customers 
consuming less than 300kWh per month. As 90% of domestic consumers were under this threshold, the 
cost of subsidies — USD 50 millions — was mostly transferred to commercial and industrial customers. 
However, only 40% of poor households have access to electricity in Guatemala. The consequence was that 
about 90% of the value of subsidies went to the non-poor. 66. 
An important issue in this cross-subsidisation programme is that the level of the threshold to 
benefit from the social tariff was too high (300kWh per month) — meaning that it was targeted to almost 
all consumers rather than only the poor. But the case also highlights the importance of the connection to 
the network which is often a more important obstacle to universal access than the cost of the service. 
Guatemalan families without a connection to the power grid have to pay significantly more for their 
electricity. For example, by relying on candles they pay the equivalent of USD 5.00 per kWh instead of 
USD 0.08. Source: Estache, Foster, and Wodon, 2001. Providing incentives to extend water services in Senegal 67. 
After different reform efforts had failed to improve water and sewage services in Senegal, the 
government decided in 1996 to introduce private participation in the sector. A state-owned holding 
company, SONES (Société Nationale des Eaux du Sénégal), was established to own the assets, carry out 
investments and regulate the water sector. SONES signed an  " enhanced "  affermage contract with the 
private company Sénégalaise des Eaux (SDE, a subsidiary of the French water company SAUR) to operate 
water utilities. Under a traditional affermage contract, the private company bills all consumers and collects 
the revenue at the tariff set by the government. The company then receives a fixed fee (covering costs and 
a regulated profit) for the total volume of water sold and remits the difference between the revenues 
collected and the fee to the government. This mechanism does not create any disincentives to serve poor 
households as the company receives the same remuneration for all kinds of consumers (that is the 
affermage fee is the same for each cubic meter of water sold). The contract between SONES and SDE is 
said to be an "enhanced" affermage contract in the sense that it incorporates some investment requirements 
as well as incentives in the fee formula to meet targets on leakage and bill collection. 68. 
A social connection programme was designed to expand service among low-income households. 
SDE receives an additional fee for each new connection in eligible poor households, through a fund 
financed by the government and donors. There is a profit included in this fee to give incentives to the 
company to install social connections. This programme was also consistent with the social tariff 
established as part of the affermage contract which, as seen earlier, is a contract that does not create 
disincentives to serve poor households. Additionally, the government financed with the help of donors and TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 22 NGOs the construction of  " standpoints "  (public water points) for low-income areas with no private 
connection. 69. 
Eight years later, this reform has resulted in significantly better services. There has been a 20% 
increase in the amount of water supplied, and the number of customers connected has increased by 35%. 
Exceeding its target requirements, SDE has installed a cumulative total of 89,000 new connections, among 
which 76% are social connections provided at low cost to poor households. According to the last 
Senegalese Household Survey (2001), drinking water is available (less than 15 minutes away) to more than 
70% of the households (almost 90% in Dakar). Source: PPIAF and WSP, 2001; and Brocklehurst and Janssens, 2004. Chilean household subsidy programme for water and sewage 70. 
In 1989 Chile created a system of subsidies for water and sewage, which took effect in 1990. 
Anyone who holds a social classification card (CAS), has a household water connection and is not more 
than three months late in paying their water bill is eligible for the subsidy. The CAS has been in effect 
since 1980 and establishes eligibility for a number of targeted subsidies in addition to water and sewage, 
including a flat-rate family allowance, minimum pensions, and housing assistance. Households applying 
for a CAS are visited by a municipal official who allocates points to the family based on the size and 
composition of the household, the occupation and education of the household head, the assets (car, 
refrigerator, land, etc.) and per capita income of the family, and the characteristics of the dwelling (e.g. 
location, number of rooms, exterior and interior materials used for construction, and whether it has a water 
or electrical connection). Households with less than a maximum number of points are then issued a CAS 
and those with lower points receive higher priority for getting subsidies. The yearly allotments for the 
water and sewage subsidy are based on bi-annual surveys of family income by region. The allotments are 
allocated so as to ensure that no family in the region pays more than five percent of its income for water 
and sewage. The subsidy is paid directly to the water supplier, who subtracts the appropriate amount from 
each household's water bill and collects the remainder of the bill directly from the customer. On average 
the subsidy covers 60% of the water bill of eligible households, although in regions with high tariffs, up to 
85% may be covered. 71. 
The number of Chilean households covered by the subsidy has gone from 5% of those eligible in 
1990 to 95% in 1996. The expansion in coverage was largely the result of a public education campaign by 
the water companies to convince eligible consumers to apply, although an easing of the conditions for 
eligibility also helped. Nevertheless, recent research also shows that some amount of the subsidy has 
leaked to higher income groups. In addition, the administrative costs of implementing the regime are high. 
In 2002, the Government decided to redistribute a substantial number of water subsidies based on an 
evaluation which showed that the subsidies were not reaching the target population precisely enough. 
Subsidies are normally given for a three year period; however the conditions of a household can change 
during that time and therefore lower the effectiveness of the programme. Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000; Estache, Gomez-Lobo and Leipziger, 2000; and Gomez-Lobo and Contreras,

Colombia adopted a programme of cross subsidies for poor households laid out in the Public 
Residential Services Law of 1994. The objective of the reform was to unify criteria for the application of 
cross-subsidies across utility industries and to guarantee consistent application of the scheme across the 
country. A geographic targeting system is used to classify locations into different levels of lower and 
higher socioeconomic groups to determine which customers are eligible to receive a subsidy from the tariff TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 23 structure. In each municipality dwellings with homogenous characteristics are classified into six 
socioeconomic categories. The criteria are set up by the National Planning Department – a government 
entity developing strategic plans for the country to promote development and economic growth which 
origins date back to 1936. Households of the first, the lowest category, receive a subsidy of up to 50% of 
the average service costs, those that belong to the second category receive up to 40%, and the ones 
belonging to the third are given a subsidy to up to 15%. The subsidies are funded through a cross subsidy, 
meaning that a surcharge has to be paid by customers of the highest household categories and by industrial 
and commercial customers. The surcharges cannot exceed 20% of the water and sewage bill, and if these 
are not sufficient to pay for the subsidies of the first three categories, the difference can be financed from 
general tax revenues (national and provincial budgets). 73. 
Almost 83% of households are classified in the first three categories, which makes the subsidy 
programme very costly and difficult to finance through the surcharges. Moreover, studies show that errors 
of inclusion are large, with subsidies often leaking to higher income segments of society. Source: Gomez-Lobo and Contreras, 2003. Regulating to meet service standards Ensuring quality of service in the Brazilian telecommunications sector 74. 
Quality of service is one of the pillars of the Brazilian telecommunication reform model, and a 
high priority for the Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel), Brazil's recently-created 
independent regulatory agency of the sector. The General Plan of Quality of Service Goals for Fixed 
Switched Telephone Service was issued by Resolution 30 of Anatel's Board of Directors on 29 June 1998 
shortly following Anatel's creation and before Telebrás, the monopoly telecommunications provider, was 
privatised. There are 36 quality of service indicators including goals for response to request for repairs, 
response to requests for change of address, response time by telephone, quality of service for public 
telephones, information regarding provider selection codes for the consumer, emission levels and network 
modernisation. Anatel can impose fines of up to R$ 40 million and has already fined a number of carriers 
for not reaching their quality of service indicators. Anatel became the first telecommunications agency in 
the world to receive an ISO-9001 certification, passing rigorous review concerning a series of requirements 
ranging from development of systemic procedures to internal quality audits. Source: ITU, 2001b. Ensuring service standards through a performance contract in the Tanzanian postal sector 75. 
Telecommunication and postal services were provided in Tanzania until 1994 by the same public 
operator, the Tanzanian Post and Telecommunication Corporation (TPTC). The postal sector was 
characterised by weak financial and operational performance, little commercial orientation and under-paid 
staff. Although a monopoly for letter and other basic services existed, it was not appropriately enforced, 
leading to growing unregulated competition from private providers of letter and parcel delivery services. In 
the early 1990s, a reform process was initiated which led to the separation of the telecommunications and 
postal public entities in 1994. The Tanzania Communications Act and the Tanzania Posts Corporation Act 
established the Tanzania Telecommunications Company and the Tanzania Postal Corporation (TPC). The 
reform also led to the creation of the Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC), an institution charged 
to regulate postal and telecommunication tariffs, monitor quality of service, oversee competition and 
safeguard network coverage and access. In 2003, the TCC merged with the Tanzania Broadcasting 
Commission, establishing the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). The reforms also 
led to the introduction of competition in the courier sector. Licences were granted to TPC and several 
courier companies to provide express services. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 24 76. 
A performance contract between the Government and TPC was signed in 1997 with the aim of 
measuring performance targets. The contract was set for three years and extended in 1999 for a further 
three years. It includes clear and measurable targets and procedures for monitoring performance with 
respect to quality of service, business growth, customer satisfaction, security, and profitability. The board 
of directors and TPC management have financial incentives to perform calculated as a percentage of 
salaries and also significant penalties for under-achievement. This includes the dismissal of the Postmaster 
General in a situation where targets are missed by more than 50%. Thus, the design of the contract 
provides an explicit incentive to reach the set targets. The contract is audited annually by independent 
consultants, including from foreign countries (New Zealand Post International Limited — now Transend 
Worldwide Limited — undertook the second audit). The first audit results indicated that the targets were 
met only in two areas, speed of service and security; however, the second audit results showed that targets 
were met in all parameters expect business growth. Source: Ianni and Lohmeyer, 2001; and Guislain, 2004; and UPU, 2004; and Walsh, 2001. Improving postal services standards through a management contract in Trinidad and Tobago 77. 
Until 1999, postal services in Trinidad and Tobago were provided by a division of the Ministry of 
Public Utilities. It was characterised by poor financial performance, low investment and decreasing mail 
volumes. The per capita mail volume stood at 12.6 pieces annually — low for an upper-middle-income 
developing country — and overall mail volumes dropped by 20 % between 1995 and 1999. The quality of 
service was poor with mail frequently taking seven to ten days to be delivered, and universal service 
reached only 50% of households. There was a great deal of unregulated competition for regular mail 
services, much based on  " self-delivery "  by utility companies. 78. 
In 1999, the government initiated a reform to modernise the postal industry. It introduced the 
Postal Act, which transformed the postal operator from a government department to a public postal entity, 
with commercial orientation — the Trinidad and Tobago Postal Corporation (TTPost). The TTPost was 
granted more management autonomy and commercial flexibility; a reserved area was maintained for letters 
with the understanding that over time this would be subject to gradual liberalisation. 79. 
The reform process started with a five-year management contract to improve efficiency, service 
quality, extend universal network coverage and gradually reduce government support. The contract was 
awarded through competitive bidding to New Zealand Post International Limited (now Transend 
Worldwide Limited), which is not a private sector company but has established experience in reform 
processes. Transend has the responsibility to manage TTPost in line with international best practice that 
would be measured by annual quality of service and revenue targets. It has a strong financial interest in 
seeing that the project succeeds, given that the contract entails a compensation package that includes a 
management fee for the day-to-day service provision and for the completion of special agreed upon 
projects. This compensation is enhanced with an incentive mechanism for exceeding certain performance 
targets, coupled with possible fee reduction if one or more of the performance targets are not achieved. The 
management operator will also share profits as TTPost's financial performance improves. The contract 
involves five performance indicators, namely customer satisfaction, expanded reach of universal delivery, 
standards for transit time, growth of revenue, and net income. The progress achieved is monitored and 
measured by independent third-party organisations. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 25 80. 
The postal service in Trinidad and Tobago has shown improvements such as the expansion of 
home delivery to rural, isolated, and economically disadvantaged areas, enhanced customer satisfaction, 
and improved reliability and security of mail delivery. The percentage of population having mail delivered 
at home increased from 53% in 1998 to about 85% in 2003. Very small communities that had no postal 
services before are being included in the delivery network. Source: Ianni and Lohmeyer, 2001; Guislain, 2004; UPU, 2003; and Walsh, 2001. Quality of service in the UK electricity distribution utilities 81. 
Since the reform of the electricity industry in 1990, the UK has adopted different approaches to 
the regulation of service quality. Until the late 90s, quality of supply in the UK was regulated through 
guaranteed standards of performance, which entitled consumers to compensation if the regulated firm 
breaches them, and overall standards, which refer to system-level performance. Overall standards were set 
for each distribution utility. In 1999, the regulator and the companies supported the introduction of an 
incentive-based regime for service quality regulation. Since the necessary foundation work had not been 
carried out, it was proposed that the incentive mechanisms should be developed as part of a work 
programme, known as the Information and Incentives Project (IIP). The IIP is divided in two parts. The 
first part defined output measures for service quality, set guidelines for improving the accuracy of their 
measurement, and constructed a framework for reporting and monitoring. The second part of the IIP 
focused on designing an incentive scheme for service quality regulation. This scheme, which is similar to a 
quality-incorporated benchmarking system, links the quality performance of the utilities to their allowed 
revenue. It consists of mechanisms that penalise companies for not meeting their quality of supply targets 
and reward companies that exceed them, including by guaranteeing less strict standards for the next control 
period. 82. 
The reform of the UK electricity industry led to a noticeable improvement of service quality. 
Between 1995 and 2000, both the number and duration of interruptions have decreased. The average time 
lost per connected customer due to planned outages has dropped from 16.3 minutes to 9.4 minutes. The 
duration of the fault-related interruptions has also declined, albeit to a lesser extent. Source: Giannakis, Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003. Improving access to electricity in rural Chile through alternative technologies 83. 
In 1994 Chile launched a subsidy programme to extend access to electricity in rural areas. Most 
of the projects have involved extension of the grid, a solution that usually means a lower cost per 
connected dwelling and a higher quality of service. But several projects have relied on alternative 
technologies, primarily one-house photovoltaic systems. These systems have been installed in isolated 
areas in the northern part of the country (for nearly 1,000 dwellings), which has some of the strongest solar 
radiation in the world. These non-conventional technologies generally provide electricity at a higher cost 
and poorer quality (lower voltage, fewer hours of service). But they have been an attractive alternative 
where extending the grid is too costly because of the distance from the existing grid or the high dispersion 
of dwellings, both of which have increased the marginal cost of rural electrification in Chile. In 1995 the 
average state subsidy per dwelling amounted to US$1,080; in 1999 it reached US$1,510. This outcome is 
nevertheless consistent with the programme's goal of maximising rural electricity coverage within budget 
constraints. At the same time, it allows a growing role for non-conventional technologies in rural 
electrification projects, as improvements in these technologies can reduce their costs and make them 
increasingly competitive with conventional solutions. Source: Jadresic, 2000. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 26 Expanding access to electricity in rural Kenya through alternative technologies 84. 
The 1997 Kenya Electric Power Act liberalised the power sector in the country and privatised the 
main power company, Kenya Power and Light — though the government still owns a controlling share. 
Kenya Power and Light now buys electricity from three new independent power producers, and more 
independent producers are preparing to enter the market. While Kenya Power and Light retains a 
monopoly on distribution, privatisation has forced the utility to carefully scrutinise programmes that are 
not cost-effective, including its rural areas. It has limited generation capacity, about 800 megawatts in 
1999, and has made urban and industrial customers a priority. During the same year, less than two percent 
of the rural population had access to grid electricity, and efforts of the utility to extend access failed, partly 
because of the sparse rural population. 85. 
As result, some rural households started to use photovoltaic systems to supply electricity 
provided by private companies. The process began in the early 80s when upper-middle class households, 
NGOs and donors of aid projects installed photovoltaic systems in off-grid areas. Since the 90s large 
numbers of rural households started to buy small photovoltaic panels and batteries. About 120,000 solar 
photovoltaic systems for household use were sold in Kenya and between 1992 and 1998 the market grew 
by more than 20% a year. Although early on the process was benefiting mostly upper-middle class 
households, technological innovation made it possible to supply smaller and cheaper products. 
Competition also contributed to lowering the retail price for a photovoltaic system from about US$100 in 
1990 to US$65 in 1998. Furthermore, the introduction of finance agencies has allowed lower-income 
households to buy photovoltaic systems on credit. 86. 
The introduction of photovoltaic systems through private entrepreneurs has shown to be 
successful in extending electricity access to the rural population. Since 1990, more than 2.5 megawatts of 
photovoltaic capacity have been sold in Kenya. The rural electrification programme of the utility connected 
fewer than 21,000 households between 1995 and 1999, while during the same period more than 80,000 
households bought solar systems. By 1999, 3 to 4 % of the rural population had acquired a photovoltaic 
system. Source: Hankins, 2000. Adapting service standards to permit extensions of low-cost water supply and sewage in El Alto 87. 
In 1997, the then recently-established independent Bolivian regulator (Superintendencia de 
Aguas) approved a Suez-led concession contract for Aguas del Illimani to provide water and sewage 
services in La Paz and El Alto. The contract contained explicit targets for connecting poor households but 
did not provide adequate financial incentives for the company to do so. Moreover, the government did not 
provide targeted subsidies to ease affordability. The concession contract stated that metered, in-house 
water and sewer connections were the only acceptable technology, which put service out of reach of poor 
households and essentially guaranteed that the company would fail to meet its ambitious target of universal 
water coverage within four years. Recognising this dilemma, the regulator and the company agreed to 
experiment with cheaper technology for providing connections. Most notably, the regulator approved the 
establishment of lower-cost condominial sewer and water connections. These systems provide in-house 
connections at lower cost by using smaller pipe diameters and burying pipes in shallow trenches in yards or 
under sidewalks. The technology was found to be acceptable to the unserved population, and has allowed 
affordable service to be extended in the poor neighbourhoods of El Alto and La Paz. In 2001 the 
condominial technology was recognised by the Bolivian Institute for Technical Norms and Standards. Source: PPIAF and WSP, 2001; and Komives, 1999. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 27 Adapting standards to expand access to water and sewage to the poor in Manila 88. 
Manila introduced private participation in its water and sewage network in 1997 under two 
separate concessions. The two concessionaires have been encouraged to use innovative technology and 
third-party provision by contracts which do not contain strict standards for what constitutes a connection, 
do not disallow third-party provision and allow the concessionaire to add households served through means 
other than conventional utility connections to the covered population for the calculation of compliance 
with coverage targets. 89. 
Responding to the need for alternatives for reaching the poor, one of the concessionaires has 
developed a system known as Bayan-Tubig (Water for the Community), for water delivery in densely-
populated, hard-to-reach slum areas. An underground water line carries water to the perimeter of a slum 
neighbourhood, and is then extended above ground, partially covered, attached to a wall, or lying on the 
surface. The line connects to a battery of meters from where each homeowner makes their own plastic 
connection, using small diameter pipes running from the main to households on the surface or along walls. 
Maintenance responsibility for the plastic pipes lies with the customers. Community-based organisations 
and NGOs play a role in intermediation and mapping of the network. 90. 
Estimates suggest that the Bayan-Tubig connections have reduced water connection costs for 
poor families by up to 25%. As even these reduced costs are sometimes a challenge, the concessionaire has 
also introduced interest-free repayment schemes over 6 to 24 month periods. Introduced in early 1999, the 
programme had provided water connections to 19,000 poor households by the end of that year, and as of 
2001 the figure had risen to over 50,000. The other concessionaire was equally unconventional in serving 
the poor, arranging to sell bulk water to a steel tank manufacturing company which then installed small 
networks to serve poor communities. Source: PPIAF, 2002. Information drawn from Rosenthal, 2002. Effective regulatory agencies and competition authorities Effective regulation for the interconnection of telecommunication networks in Morocco 91. 
Morocco's National Telecommunication Regulatory Agency (ANRT) has broad responsibilities 
regarding the technical regulation of interconnection in the country. 8 It is charged with approving the 
technical and tariff conditions offered by operators, and particularly by Maroc Télécom, the incumbent 
operator, also provider of mobile telephone and value-added services. ANRT also revises interconnection 
agreements where necessary and settles disputes in regard to interconnection if required to do so by one of 
the parties to the agreement (in conformity with the law). ANRT lets the parties negotiate interconnection 
charges freely, even though the interconnection agreement must include a number of technical, 
administrative and financial conditions. Where a given operator has more than 20% of the market, it is 
mandatory for it to offer a technical and tariff quotation, which must receive prior approval from ANRT 
(dominant operators must maintain separate accounts for their interconnection activities). 92. 
A number of disputes concerning interconnection and abuse of dominant position have already 
been referred to ANRT. A recent one involved Médi Télécom, the second licensed mobile operator, and 
Maroc Télécom. At the beginning of 2001, Maroc Télécom decided to offer a ten percent discount to all its 8 The concept of interconnection refers mainly to reciprocal services offered by operators of networks that are open to

anti-competitive. It alleged that the same discount should apply to all calls in either direction between fixed

Télécom, and decided that the application of discounts for Maroc Télécom customers only was 
discriminatory and constituted an abuse of Maroc Télécom's dominant position with respect to the fixed 
network. An initial injunction was therefore issued at the end of February 2001, in which ANRT reviewed 
the facts of the case and instructed Maroc Télécom to adhere strictly to the conditions set out in its terms of 
reference. Since Maroc Télécom did not respond within the allotted 30-day period for doing so, ANRT 
placed Maroc Télécom on notice, giving it 30 days to remedy the situation or otherwise face penalties up to 
permanent withdrawal of the license. Subsequently, Maroc Télécom complied with the regulator's 
decision. Source: ITU, 2001c. Peruvian Court for consumer dispute resolution in the telecommunications sector 93. 
The Peruvian Administrative Court for consumer dispute resolution (TRASU) was created in 
1995 by the regulator, OSIPTEL. TRASU decisions are made on behalf of OSIPTEL, but its decisions are 
taken independently from OSIPTEL's Board of Directors and administration. TRASU intervenes only once 
the consumer appeals the operator's response to a claim. Conciliation between the operator and the 
consumer may be possible during the process. TRASU is a six-member collegiate body, supported by a 
technical secretariat. OSIPTEL's Board of Directors appoints members to TRASU for an undefined term. 
Members are professionals of high standing who serve on a part-time basis. The technical secretariat is 
staffed with competent professionals that support the administrative court decisions. TRASU issues 
guidelines on how it analyses complaints, which are based on previous cases and signal to consumers and 
operators the likely outcome of future decisions. TRASU also rules on the proof needed to resolve claims, 
and which party bears the burden of proof. In case of complaints regarding fixed line local calls, TRASU is 
authorised to ask for the following as evidence: reports on faulty service; records of technical inspection; 
average and variable measured local service usage; itemised call reports; and call investigation 
information. 94. 
TRASU has the power to interpret and solve claims regarding all telecommunication services, 
which are related to infringements of consumer rights, including billing, installation, and quality of service. 
It can also impose fines if the operator fails to abide by its decisions. TRASU can also rule on procedural 
grounds, e.g. imposing a default judgment in favour of the consumer if the operator fails to meet a court-
imposed deadline to resolve the consumer's case. Although TRASU's decisions may be appealed to the 
courts, few are. Parties are not charged for TRASU´s services, unless there is a clear case of misuse of the 
claim procedure. About 48% of the 35,000 claims handled by TRASU during 1995-2001 were resolved in 
favour of consumers. An on-line consultation service available on the OSIPTEL Website enables users to 
track the status of their claim. Source: Apoyo Consultoria, 2002. Failure to ensure independence of the telecommunications regulator in Ghana 95. 
The performance of telecommunication services operators in Ghana, following the liberalisation 
of the sector in the 1990s, has been viewed by the government and the general public as unsatisfactory. 
One of the factors that led to this poor performance relates to the fact that the independence of the National 
Communication Authority (NCA), the sectoral regulatory body established in 1996, has not been 
appropriately safeguarded by the law. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 29 96. 
There are three main reasons for this. The first is that the President appoints all members of the 
NCA Board. Thus, the Board can be removed at any time by the President for  " stated reasons " , leaving the 
appointment of the Board open to possible political interference. Further, the formation of the Board was 
delayed — there was no Director-General and the Acting Director was changed three times in the first 
three years. The Board was finally named in 2000 just before the parliamentary elections, but after these 
elections, won by the opposition, a new Board was appointed. Second, the law subjects the NCA's 
functions to the directions of the Minister of Communications who, since 2000, also serves as the 
Chairman of the Board. For instance, according to the law,  " (the Minister) may give to the Authority such 
directions of a general character as appear to him to be required in the public interest relating to the 
discharge of the functions of the Authority " . Thus, the functions of the NCA could also be open to political 
interference. Third, the financial autonomy of the NCA has been seen as excessive. The law empowers it to 
generate funds by requiring payment of a fixed percentage of the total turnover of fixed and mobile phone 
operators. The NCA also collects a further one percent of operators' turnover for the Ghana Investment 
Fund for Telecommunications (GIFTEL) to promote rural telephony in particular and development of 
telecommunications in general. The use of these funds by the NCA has, however, not been specified in the 
law apart from the annual report that the Board must present to the President through the sectoral Minister. Source: Ahortor, 2003; and Haggarty, Shirley and Wallsten, 2002. Difficulties in establishing effective regulatory bodies in the Indian telecommunications sector 97. 
India started a gradual liberalisation of its telecommunications sector in 1985. The decision to 
open the wireless telephone market to private companies was taken in 1991 and was implemented in 1994. 
The government's licenses plan divided the Nation into four large metropolitan areas. Auctions were 
organised to select private companies, from which State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in charge of fixed lines 
were barred from participating. Licenses were awarded in the four cities in November 1994 and the 
companies began their operations in 1997. However, competition with incumbent SOEs was weakened 
when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allowed SOEs into wireless service in 1996 without 
paying the license fee (or the interconnection charges paid by the private companies). The DoT also 
decided to increase the interconnection charge, further weakening competition. 98. 
In 1997, a new independent regulator was established, the Telecommunications Regulatory 
Agency of India (TRAI). From its inception, TRAI sought to increase the level of competition among 
operators. It asserted its authority on interconnection prices and asked the government to renounce the 
increase in the interconnection charge. DoT sued TRAI and the High Court ruled that the regulator lacked 
the authority to ask for the rate change. A second conflict occurred over TRAI's attempt to introduce 
 " calling party pays "  for interconnections from fixed to wireless telephones (to discourage people from not 
answering their mobile phones and calling back from their fixed line), which TRAI again lost. The next 
battle was between DoT and wireless carriers who where unable to pay their license fees. From the 
government's point of view, this was the result of over-bidding and poor business decisions, whereas 
operators argued that the government's inadequate pricing rules prevented them from being commercially 
viable. Unpaid license fees soared and the DoT started to withdraw interconnection from operators unable 
to pay. By early 1999, the Indian telecommunications reform was under significant pressure, with a 
regulator without authority over prices and entry decisions, and many private entrants almost bankrupt and 
unable to compete with SOEs. 99. 
In March 1999, in an attempt to solve these problems, a new policy was adopted which gave 
TRAI the authority to regulate prices and to adjudicate disputes between SOEs and private entrants. 
Following further controversies, the reform was appealed and a new ruling of the High Court vacated the 
authority of TRAI over the DoT. In January 2000, the government adopted an ordnance that removed 
authority over telecommunications from the High Court and created a Telecommunications Dispute TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 30 Settlement Appellate Tribunal. New changes were agreed between TRAI and the government to level the 
playing field between SOEs and private wireless companies. The reform is now considered a success, 
leading to a rapid growth of reliable and affordable wireless services over the last years. Source: Noll and Wallsten, 2004. Difficulties to implement a regulatory framework for postal services in Argentina 100. 
Until 1993, postal services in Argentina were provided by the state owned postal operator 
ENCOTEL (Empresa Nacional de Correos y Telégrafos), which had a statutory monopoly on postal 
service provision. ENCOTEL was providing a universal service consisting of the collection and delivery of 
ordinary mail items up to 20 grams, the handling of standard telegrams up to 20 words and giro checks up 
to ARS1000 ($1). The state-owned operator was characterised by poor service, low productivity, limited 
management information and losses of over $150 millions per annum. The monopoly, though, already 
started to weaken in the 70s with the Postal Law allowing private companies to obtain  " permissions "  to 
service the market. By 1994, about 300 private sector companies were operating in the market with a share 
of 50%, though only 4 were of significant size. 101. 
In 1992, the Government of Argentina introduced a decree that established a new regulator for 
the sector, the National Post and Telegraph Commission (CNCT), clearly separating the regulatory and 
operating functions. At the same time, ENCOTEL started to operate under private law and became the 
National Post and Telegraph Company (ENCOTESA). One year later, in 1993, the postal monopoly was 
abolished and the market was officially opened to private participation. 102. 
In 1997 the Government decided to introduce private sector participation in ENCOTESA through 
a 30 year concession contract. The competitive tendering process was awarded to the Macri Group, a local 
consortium, with technical expertise provided by the British Post Office. ENCOTESA was to provide basic 
universal service set at pre-concession levels. Tariffs for these services were also fixed at pre-concession 
levels whereas ENCOTESA was free to set prices for the other services. The concession holder was further 
obliged to invest US $250 million over the first ten years to improve outlets and service provision. It was 
also required to pay a fee for the rights to the concession of USD 104 million per annum in two six-
monthly tranches. At the same time, an effective regulatory framework was not put in place in the case of 
the other private operators of postal services. No license was required for private companies to access the 
postal market, except for a subscription in the Public Register of the Suppliers of Postal Services and the 
payment of an annual sum of US $5000. In addition, there were no requisites for quality standards and 
private companies were also excluded from requirements of universal postal service. 103. 
The concession initially led to several improvements, including with respect to efficiency through 
inter alia automation of administrative functions and installation of telecommunication networks 
integrating the first 500 of the mail's 1,500 branches, thereby offering new services. Financial losses were 
increasingly reduced and reached USD 20 million in 1999. However, the lack of a sound regulatory 
framework to underpin liberalisation coupled with large financial demands on ENCOTESA (fee payments 
plus investment requirements) meant that this process came to a halt. While there has been no contraction 
of services in rural areas neither has there been any significant roll-out of new addresses or postal outlets in 
the country-side. Similarly, limited efforts were made to improve quality of service. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 31 104. 
In March 2001, new regulations were established to bring change from a completely free market 
to a market of licensed competition, including with respect to quality and universal service obligations. All 
the private operators are required to obtain ISO 9000 approval as a condition to retain their licenses and 
Article 48 provides for warnings, fines, and temporary or permanent withdrawal of operating rights for 
infringing the regulations. Source: Fontdevila and Jensen, 2003; and Walsh, 2001. Effective regulation to ensure competition in the postal services in Sweden 105. 
In 1993, the Swedish postal monopoly was abolished and the postal operator was transformed 
from a government agency to a limited liability company owned by the state, Sweden Post. Since then, 
there are no reserved areas maintained in the postal market and a regulatory authority was established, the 
National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS). PTS is an independent regulator monitoring the liberalised 
postal market, including with respect to pricing, quality of service, and competition in the sector. 
Additionally, during the same period, the Swedish Competition Authority was established charged to 
implement the general competition law in Sweden. The letter mail market is dominated by Sweden Post, 
with a market share of 93% in 2003. Its biggest competitor, CityMail, had a market share of 6.5% during 
the same year while the remaining 0.5% of the letter mail market is handled by 26 local postal operators. 106. 
Competition rules have been an effective instrument to deal with anti-competitive behaviour in 
the Swedish postal market. Since 1993, the Swedish Competition Authority has had more than a hundred 
cases concerning Sweden Post. In one case, Sweden Post had exclusive agreement conditions tying 
customers into buying from it all or the majority of their distribution needs. The Competition Authority 
considered these practices an abuse of Sweden Post's dominant position and the Stockholm City Court 
ordered Sweden Post to pay a fine of SEK 3.8 million for infringing the law. In another case, Sweden Post 
applied a zonal pricing scheme for bulk mail postal services. The pricing structure meant that a lower rate 
would be applied to distribution in 19 places/areas, which were then further subdivided into 3 zones. The 
lowest rate was in the area that covered the three largest urban regions — Stockholm, Göteborg and 
Malmö. The Authority considered that Sweden Post's pricing did not reflect the way individual customers 
purchased postal distribution services, and that they were designed to make it difficult for other companies 
to compete. The practice was thus considered an abuse of Sweden Post's dominant position and the 
company was ordered under penalty of a fine not to apply zonal pricing. In yet another case, Sweden Post 
applied a  " cream skimming'' clause. This meant that customers could anticipate a price increase if they 
purchased a part of their distributional needs from CityMail. The Competition Authority ruled that this was 
a violation of the law, particularly as this practice did not entail any provision of information to customers 
on the price consequences of not purchasing all their needs from Sweden Post. Source: Jonsson, 2004; King, 2001; PTS, 1999; and Svensson, 1998. An independent regulatory agency in the Chilean water supply sector 107. 
The Chilean reform of the water supply sector greatly strengthened monitoring, by replacing a 
hands-on government agency with an independent, arms-length regulator. Before reform, the Santiago 
Metropolitan Sanitary Works Enterprise (EMOS) was under the supervision of SENDOS (Servicio 
Nacional de Obras Sanitarias), an arm of the Ministry of Public Works. The reform created an independent 
regulatory agency, the Superintendency of Sanitary Services (SSS), designed to signal government's 
commitment to potential private investors and avoid consumer exploitation. 108. 
The organisational design of the SSS was detailed in a law that mandated a small, professional 
staff with above average civil service salaries. The SSS's maximum professional staff cannot exceed 45 
according to the law, while SENDOS had over 300 staff when it was dissolved in 1990. Although the staff TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 32 of both agencies were civil servants, the salaries for SSS professionals are similar to those of bank or stock 
market regulators, and hence higher than those which SENDOS could pay. All SSS professional staff have 
completed at least four years of higher education, which was not true in SENDOS, and most are engineers. 
Unlike SENDOS, the SSS has no management responsibilities. Its focus is on measuring cost and 
efficiency in the context of tariff adjustments and on assuring compliance with quality standards and 
investment plans. In addition, the new regulatory contract for EMOS signals government commitment to 
reform by including specific provisions related to enforcement against government reneging of the 
contract. Any water company can appeal a dispute over tariffs to the SSS within 30 days. If the SSS and 
the company fail to reach agreement, a panel of three arbitrators — one appointed by the company, one by 
the government and one jointly agreed — has 37 days to reach a decision that both sides must accept. 
Decisions can also be appealed to the courts. The fact that utilities can appeal the decision of the regulator 
increases the credibility of the contract. Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000. Transparency and users' involvement Citizen Report Cards in Bangalore 109. 
The Public Affairs Centre (PAC) in Bangalore, India, has done pioneering work on Citizen 
Report Cards over the past decade. The first report card on Bangalore's public agencies in 1994 covered 
municipal services, water supply, electricity, telecom and transport. Since then, PAC has brought out report 
cards on several other cities, rural services and also on social services such as health care. The findings of 
the first CRC on Bangalore were most striking. Almost all the public service providers received low ratings 
from the people. Agencies were rated and compared in terms of public satisfaction, corruption and 
responsiveness. The media publicity that the findings received, and the public discussions that followed, 
brought the issue of public services out in the open. Civil society groups began to organise themselves to 
voice their demands for better performance. Some of the public agencies responded to these demands and 
took steps to improve their services. The inter-agency comparisons and the associated public glare seem to 
have contributed to this outcome. When the second report card on Bangalore came out in 1999, these 
improvements were reflected in the somewhat better ratings that the agencies received. Still several 
agencies remained indifferent and corruption levels continued to be high. The third CRC on Bangalore, in 
2003, has shown a surprising turnaround in the city's services. It noted a remarkable rise in the citizen 
ratings of almost all the agencies. Not only did public satisfaction improve across the board, but problem 
incidence and corruption seem to have declined perceptibly in the routine transactions between the public 
and the agencies. It is clear that more decisive steps have been taken by the agencies to improve services 
between 1999 and 2003. Source: Paul, 2004; and Ravindra, 2004. Transparency in Peru's telecommunications regulator 110. 
OSIPTEL, Peru's regulatory body for the telecommunications sector, has established several 
mechanisms to generate a greater level of transparency in its daily activities and especially in its decision 
making. These include: @BULLET Advance publication of any standard of general application, with inputs received from operating 
companies and consumers analysed, evaluated and taken into account in the proposed measures. @BULLET Public hearings providing an exchange of views on specific topics, to create a direct relationship 
between OSIPTEL and operators, consumers and other interested parties. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 33 @BULLET Consultations to solve disputes between public telecommunication service operators or between 
an operating company and consumers via conciliation and agreement between the parties. @BULLET Establishment of independent, ad hoc collegiate bodies of multidisciplinary experts to resolve 
disputes. 111. 
Other activities aimed at adding transparency to OSIPTEL's regulatory decisions include the 
holding of seminars, the preparation of publications and allowing access to the general public to its 
Information and Documentation Services, which hold the technical studies underlying OSIPTEL's 
regulatory decisions, as well as the regulatory policies applied in other countries. 112. 
In 2002, following increasing demand from consumers for information, OSIPTEL began 
experimenting with a mobile unit called MoviAyuda which travels throughout Lima, the capital city, 
especially to high-complaint locations and areas with high pedestrian traffic. MoviAyuda brings the 
regulator to the consumer, facilitates access to information, and reduces consumer costs and efforts in 
obtaining relevant information. MoviAyuda also provides valuable feedback on the main problems 
between operators and their customers, enabling the regulator to identify issues requiring policy action. 
MoviAyuda doubled OSIPTEL's contacts with consumers in the initial two months of its launch — 
including calls to its call centre (FonoAyuda) and visits to the regulator's offices. OSIPTEL has 
furthermore set up temporary kiosks in highly-populated locations — such as business centres, public 
squares and universities — staffed by personnel that can provide information or take complaints. Source: ITU, 2001a; and Apoyo Consultoria, 2002. The Australian Consumer Consultative Forum 113. 
The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) — the telecommunications regulatory agency 
responsible for licensing, technical regulation and consumer protection — has a legislative obligation to 
provide information to consumers on telecommunication issues, with the goal of creating a community that 
is informed about the rights and options available to them in Australia's market. The Consumer 
Consultative Forum (CCF) was established in 1997 in accordance with the Australian Communications 
Authority Act 1997. The forum meets twice a year and provides the ACA with a formal mechanism for 
consulting consumer representatives on a wide range of telecommunication issues. Members of the CCF 
include organisations that represent consumer interests from a variety of perspectives, relevant government 
agencies and industry bodies. The terms of reference for the CCF are to: a) assist the ACA with consumer 
consultation on matters relating to its telecommunication functions; b) ensure that consumer interests are 
adequately considered in ACA's decision-making; and c) assist in informing the community about 
telecommunication service issues and matters relating to the industry. Issues put forward for consultation 
include access to services, quality of service, impact of new technologies on consumers, including those 
with special interests and needs, and comprehensive consumer impact statements. Source: Apoyo Consultoria, 2002. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 34 PART II: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES AND THE GATS I. 
Introduction 114. 
The aim of this part of the study is to complement Part I by linking the discussion of the 
liberalisation of network infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main 
issues related to these services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in 
light of real liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these 
services. 115. 
More precisely, this part of the study starts from the premise that to date, with the exception of 
telecommunication services, progress on bound liberalisation of network infrastructure services under the 
GATS has been limited. This notwithstanding the potential gains that can be derived by making GATS 
commitments in these services. It thus reviews some of the key concerns potentially influencing WTO 
Members' decisions not to enter commitments in these services and attempts to address them. 116. 
In particular, it reviews problems raised in relation to the main classification instruments used by 
WTO Members in making commitments in network infrastructure services and what options are available 
to countries in this regard. It then examines key GATS provisions that may be relevant for the provision of 
these services to the public. The discussion in Part I shows that there is a strong public service aspect to the 
provision of network infrastructure services and that they require an appropriate regulatory framework to 
ensure social objectives, such as availability, quality and affordability of service. The aim here is to address 
concerns raised in relation to the potential impact of the GATS on governments' control over the provision 
of these services and explore how its framework can accommodate and support the objectives of national 
polices. 117. 
Like other international treaties, GATS disciplines can put regulatory constraints on Member 
governments. Yet countries accept such disciplines because they deem them necessary to reaping the full 
benefits from international cooperation in a rules-based system. The underlying thread throughout this part 
of the study is that the GATS affords wide flexibility for Members to tailor obligations to their national 
policy objectives. 118. 
The next section reviews the benefits that may arise from enhanced GATS commitments in 
network infrastructure services. Section III then discusses the limited progress achieved so far on 
liberalising these services under the GATS. Section IV presents the main issues related to the classification 
of network infrastructure services in the context of the GATS. The remaining sections assess whether main 
GATS disciplines may lead to a loss of government ability to ensure adequate provision of these services 
to the public. II. 
Benefits of improved GATS commitments 119. 
It is important to recall the economic case that underpins bound liberalisation of network 
infrastructure services under the GATS. Enhanced GATS commitments in these services can create 
momentum for further domestic sector reform and much needed investment capital, and can anchor these 
reforms within an international legal framework. GATS commitments can also provide a credible signal TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 35 that the government is committed to sector reform and has taken the necessary legal and regulatory 
measures to allow for such investment (Bressie et al., 2004). 120. 
In particular, GATS commitments send a signal to WTO Member governments and, in turn, their 
investors, that there will be a rules-based, transparent, predictable and non-discriminatory regime in place. 
In addition, the dispute settlement system provides an avenue of recourse should a country's 
implementation of sector reforms fail to satisfy that country's GATS commitments. Investors who may 
have questioned the government's commitment to sector reform can rest assured that there is an 
international process for settling these disputes (through their governments) where a WTO Member has 
undertaken GATS commitments in that sector. Without such commitments, investors would have to rely 
solely on domestic legal remedies or international arbitration, if such recourse is available. WTO 
commitments can thus contribute to improve the investment climate and increase the likelihood of new 
investment in the sector. 121. 
This new investment can in turn provide capital, as well as technical and managerial expertise, to 
build and expand the networks and services. This can be particularly important for network infrastructure 
services which, as seen in Part I, require huge amounts of capital investment. 122. 
Another dimension of GATS commitments relates to the mercantilist nature of trade negotiations. 
While considerable unilateral liberalisation of trade in services has taken place, it has been uneven, 
especially in areas of export interest to developing countries. However, in trade negotiations, some 
leverage for obtaining commitments from trading partners can be generated if a Member signals a 
willingness to make GATS commitments in sectors or modes of export interest or in other parts of the 
WTO agenda. III. 
Uneven and limited progress to date 123. 
Notwithstanding these benefits, with the exception of telecommunication services, progress on 
committing these services under the GATS has been limited. The telecommunications sector is one of the 
most committed sectors overall. 105 WTO Members (counting EC Member States individually) have made 
specific commitments concerning some aspect of the telecommunications sector. In basic 
telecommunications, commitments have been made by 104 governments, 90 of whom committed during or 
since the negotiations on basic telecommunications that took place after the end of the Uruguay Round. 
Their suppliers account for well in excess of 90% of the world's total telecommunications revenues. In the 
area of value-added telecommunication services, 89 governments have made commitments. It should be 
recognised, however, that commitments may imply very different levels of access depending on the 
limitations scheduled. 124. 
Nevertheless, the situation is quite different in the case of the other sectors. Including the post-
Uruguay Round accession countries, few WTO Members have made commitments in postal services, 
although more Members have committed to courier services (10 and 49 respectively). About 17 
commitments were made on energy distribution, and 56 commitments (counting EC Member States 
individually) were made on waste water management services. No commitments have been made on water 
distribution services. 125. 
This varied situation is due to a combination of factors. First, introduction of competition in the 
telecommunications sector, which has been more widely embraced than in other infrastructure sectors, has 
lead to significant price decreases and improved service world-wide. The working group established during 
the Uruguay Round succeeded in producing a substantive sectoral Annex for the sector. The Annex on 
Telecommunications sets out guarantees of reasonable access to and use of basic telecommunication 
services provided by public operators. In addition, unlike the other sectors, telecommunication services TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 36 were negotiated by WTO Members as a separate negotiation dedicated to the sector following the Uruguay 
Round. The Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications (hereafter the  " Reference Paper " ) also 
emerged in the separate negotiations. The Reference Paper consists of a set of obligations for a pro-
competitive regulatory framework for basic telecommunications that become legally binding obligations 
when a Member adds these to its schedule of commitments. To date, 78 Members have committed to the 
Reference Paper in whole or with few, if any departures. 126. 
Conversely, as seen in Part I, the introduction of competition has been more gradual or difficult 
in the other sectors. Nevertheless, since the Uruguay Round significant reforms to introduce competition 
have been undertaken which have changed the market characteristics of these services in many countries. 
So there seems to be scope now to achieve more progress at the multilateral level and the Doha Round 
offers WTO Members an opportunity for anchoring recent policy reforms, giving them more permanency 
in a flexible and progressive manner. 127. 
Yet so far, with the possible exception of telecommunications, only relatively few Members have 
tabled new or improved offers in these services and developing countries' participation remains limited. To 
date, only a few Members have offered new commitments or improved upon or clarified existing 
commitments in the relevant network infrastructure services: telecommunications (36), postal services and 
courier services (15) energy services (14) and waste water treatment services (13). IV. 
Classification of network infrastructure services 128. 
Part of the reason explaining this lack of progress relates to classification issues. Two main 
instruments are used in the WTO for this purpose: the GATS Services Sectoral Classification List 
(commonly referred to as W/120) and the United Nations Provisional Central Product Classification 
(Provisional CPC). W/120 lists 12 services sectors, disaggregated in about 160 sub-sectors, indicating for 
each of them the corresponding Provisional CPC number. The GATS does not oblige Members to use any 
specific classification instruments, though once included in a schedule of commitments the corresponding 
classification becomes legally binding. 129. 
For the most part, the concerns seem to reflect the way in which network infrastructure services 
were provided at the time the classifications were developed. For instance, energy services are not 
classified as a separate section under W/120. The few GATS commitments on energy services are 
scheduled under pipeline transportation of fuels under transport services and as several entries such as 
technical testing and analysis, and services incidental to mining and energy distribution under other 
business services. This is largely due to the fact that energy markets were characterised at the time of the 
Uruguay Round by vertically-integrated, state-owned monopolies, operating mainly in national markets, 
especially in the case of electricity companies. Moreover, it had been a traditional practice in the energy 
sector not to draw clear lines of distinction between goods and services. This was inconsistent with the 
rationale of the Round, which was based on the clear and precise identification of trade-related services. 130. 
Similar issues also arise in the case of postal/courier and environmental services. The Provisional 
CPC classifies postal services as the relevant delivery services carried out exclusively by national postal 
administrations and courier services as essentially the same delivery services performed by private 
companies. In reality, public postal administrations and private companies compete not only in a number of 
services traditionally open, such as parcel and express delivery, but also in services once more commonly 
reserved to public postal administrations. Several countries are also of the view that W/120 and the 
Provisional CPC — which comprise sewage services, refuse-disposal services, sanitation and similar 
services and other services — are outdated and do not reflect commercial realities in environmental 
services as they focus mainly on waste management and pollution control. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 37 131. 
Furthermore, one important feature of the GATS classification (and of most classifications) is 
that services sectors are broken down into segments, which in reality are often bundled with other 
activities, such as transportation, engineering, construction and financial services. For example, one 
characteristic of postal and courier services is that they typically own their own fleets of trucks and even 
airplanes. They are thus also dependent on commitments in air and road transport services that are 
identified as sectors in their own right in W/120. Road transport may be a significant means of delivery for 
parcels and other items within geographic regions or contiguous countries, and air transport is the 
predominant means of delivery among distant locations. This can have important implications for the value 
of commitments when, for example, different levels of market access are extended to different activities 
that as a practical matter are inter-dependent or supplied in a bundled manner. Options available to WTO Members in current negotiations 132. 
These definitional issues are important because they define the extent to which specific 
commitments apply to a given market. WTO Members have thus been discussing ways to modernise the 
classifications under W/120 and ideas have been put forward to address the related concerns. While in light 
of divergent views it may be difficult in the short-term to agree on new classification instruments, as noted 
earlier, WTO Members are not required to use any particular classification and the Members concerned are 
free to modify the classifications contained in their schedules of commitments (as long as consistency with 
previous commitments is maintained). By the same token, those Members that consider that W/120 
remains a valid framework to schedule commitments in the relevant sectors can simply maintain it in their 
schedules. 133. 
For example, in the case of energy several proposals have been tabled by some WTO Members 
concerning the organisation of W/120, with the aim of creating a definition of the sector to facilitate the 
scheduling of commitments. Most of the negotiating proposals define the scope of the energy services 
sector as covering the whole chain of energy activities (from resource identification to transmission and 
distribution). They suggest new classifications or  " scheduling guides "  that can be used to make 
commitments under the existing classification structure (from recent discussions it seems that these WTO 
Members have abandoned the idea to introduce a new entry for energy in W/120). Some countries 
(Norway and the US) have then presented offers that include a separate energy-related section in the 
schedule. Meanwhile, other Members have made offers containing energy-related commitments under 
other related categories such as transport and business services. 134. 
For postal and courier services the main issue relates to the integration of courier services into 
postal services, given that the original premise for having separate classifications no longer applies. Most 
submissions thus propose removal of the distinction between postal and courier services. In environmental 
services, several Members have proposed revised classifications of the sector, they felt better reflect the 
commercial realities of the sector. Here again, while some Members have made offers which have de facto 
adopted a new classification for environmental services, other Members have simply retained W/120. The 
most ambitious of the proposals has been submitted by the EC and suggests the creation of seven sub-
sectors based on the environmental media (air, water, soil, waste, noise and so forth). 9 The EC submission 
includes a category for  " Services related to the collection, purification and distribution of water " , which is 
not classified in either W/120 or in the services part of the Provisional CPC, but which is technically often 
closely associated with environmental services as seen in Part I. 135. 
WTO Members have also been discussing ways to ensure that any commitments in network 
infrastructure services are not undermined by lack of commitments in other sectors. One potential solution 9 The EC classification proposal closely resembles a similar classification previously developed by the OECD and 
Eurostat (see OECD/Eurostat, 1999 for details). TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 38 could be the establishment of a list or guide similar to the one proposed by some Members for energy 
services. This list (in addition to the identification of  " core "  services) would comprise services which are 
not telecommunication, postal/courier or environmental per se, but which are related or important to their 
provision. These related services would be subject to a  " cluster "  or  " check-list " , which could be used as an 
aide-mémoire during the negotiations. The resulting candidates for commitments would then be scheduled 
in the relevant GATS sectors. V. 
The GATS and policy control 136. 
Perhaps more importantly, particularly in the case of environmental network and energy services, 
concerns have been raised about the potential effect of the GATS on the ability of governments to ensure 
adequate provision of these services to the public. In practice, this refers to the possible impact of the 
Agreement on governments' ability to maintain their traditional public service responsibilities either 
through monopoly public utilities, exclusive rights to provide services or appropriately regulated 
competition. These problems are intensified by the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and 
some of its provisions remain to be tested in practice. In light of the importance of these services for 
society and their highly regulated nature, governments have been cautious about agreeing to subject these 
sectors to binding commitments on competitive supply. The GATS, like other legally bound undertakings 
in the WTO (or other international treaties), can affect the regulatory conduct of governments. At the same 
time, the Agreement affords WTO Members considerable flexibility in this regard. 137. 
The GATS applies to any service in any sector, with two main exclusions, the most important of 
which in the context of network infrastructure services is the exclusion of services supplied in the exercise 
of governmental authority. 10 It defines trade in services by reference to four modes of supply. The 
traditional concept of trade in goods is imbedded in  " cross border supply "  (mode 1), which refers to the 
supply of a service from the territory of one Member into the territory another Member.  " Consumption 
abroad "  (mode 2) involves the supply of a service in the territory of one Member to a service consumer of 
another Member. Network infrastructure services are for the most part supplied through the establishment 
of a  " commercial presence "  (mode 3), possibly accompanied by the  " presence of a natural person(s) "  
(mode 4). 138. 
The Agreement explicitly recognises in its Preamble  " the right of Members to regulate the supply 
of services within their territory in order to meet national policy objectives " . Market access (Article XVI) 
and national treatment (Article XVII) need to be granted only in sectors which a Member lists in its 
schedule of specific commitments. Members have also significant flexibility in scheduling as they are free 
to choose and define the sectors, and select the modes of supply for which they are ready to undertake 
specific commitments. Commitments can additionally be qualified with various types of relevant 
limitations, thus allowing Members to tailor them to specific national policy objectives. 139. 
In the absence of specific commitments, the GATS imposes only limited obligations. The most 
important of these is the most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, a prohibition to discriminate among 
foreign providers supplying the same service. Each member had the opportunity to seek exemption from 
the MFN obligation at the date of entry into force of the Agreement (an opportunity also afforded to 
subsequent acceding countries). Even for committed services, many regulatory practices and objectives not 
relevant to listing within the schedule itself are currently subject to fairly minimal disciplines on domestic 
regulation (see below). 10 The other exclusion relates to measures affecting air traffic rights or services directly related to the exercise of 
traffic rights. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 39 140. 
Regulations may also breach obligations and commitments under the GATS and still be allowed 
under the provisions of Article XIV on exceptions. These provisions can be invoked to protect major 
public interests, including safety, human, plant or animal life or health, national security, public morals and 
public order. They can also be invoked to deal with the effects of a default in services contracts. The 
measures should not, however, be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or 
unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on 
trade in services. The carve-out for  " services in the exercise of governmental authority "  141. 
As noted, the GATS applies in principle to all services, except those provided in the exercise of 
governmental authority. GATS Article I.3 (b) states that, for the purpose of the GATS,  " services "  include 
 " any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority " . This 
exception is further defined in Article I.3 (c), which specifies that  " a service supplied in the exercise of 
governmental authority "  means  " any service, which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in 
competition with one or more service suppliers " . As such, supply of services by a monopoly (whether 
publicly or privately owned) is not alone sufficient to exempt such services from coverage, if they are sold 
to the public on a commercial basis. 142. 
In practice, since there is no single model of governmental provision of these services within 
WTO membership, as the concept varies according to different sectors or segments, national traditions and 
legal conditions, the coverage of the carve-out will vary depending on the country and service concerned. 
However, uncertainties remain about its exact scope (see Krawjeski, 2003; Cossy, 2005; and Adlung, 
2005). This definition does not provide for a clear determination of whether and under what circumstances 
network infrastructure services provided on a monopoly basis by public utilities of particular Members 
would fall outside the coverage of "services". 143. 
This uncertainty stems mainly form the lack of clear definitions or guidelines. For example, 
regarding services supplied on a non-commercial basis, while services provided for free would be likely to 
fulfil this condition, it is less clear whether the same could be said in the case of cost-recovery fees. Even 
equating commercial with profit-seeking would still leave some questions unanswered as to what concepts 
of profit would be relevant. Similar questions arise with respect to the precise meaning of  " nor in 
competition with one or more service suppliers " , coupled with the fact that some network infrastructure 
services, e.g. environmental network services, remain for the most part natural monopolies, meaning there 
may only be one supplier in a given market. Network infrastructure services and government procurement 144. 
Another important issue concerning the scope of the GATS relates to government procurement. 
Government procurement of services — defined as the  " procurement by governmental agencies of services 
purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the 
supply of services for commercial resale "  — is exempted from the MFN, market access and national 
treatment obligations (Article XIII:1). Since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, WTO Members have 
been negotiating the possibility to develop disciplines for procurement of services. For the time being, the 
only comprehensive WTO disciplines in this area are contained in the plurilateral Agreement on 
Government Procurement (GPA). 145. 
A key question that arises in the context of government procurement of services is to what extent 
contractual arrangements, such as concessions or build-operate-transfers (BOTs), fall under the Article XIII 
definition of government procurement. It is unclear under what circumstances and what types of 
arrangements would fall outside the scope of these three central GATS provisions. As seen in Part I, TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 40 concessionary arrangements play a major role in the supply of network infrastructure services. Recent 
discussions show that WTO Members have different views in this regard and that even the definition of 
different kinds of arrangements varies among countries. Some stress that the arrangements providing for a 
contractee to sell commercial services to the public, rather than to sell such services to the government for 
its own use, would not be covered by the definition of government procurement. However, this view is not 
commonly agreed. 146. 
Cossy (2005) has provided some initial insight into the complex question of contractual 
arrangements and government procurement of services. In the case of concession contracts, she argues that 
for the most part they could not be considered a form of government procurement. This is because they 
typically do not entail a purchase of service by the government and the service is not for the direct 
consumption of the government but is supplied to consumers. For other forms of contracts such as 
management contracts, the case for government procurement appears to be stronger, since the government 
more clearly purchases and consumes the service for its own use. The state of BOT contracts remains to be 
clarified, given that they combine elements of procurement (construction of a public facility) with 
concessional regimes (granting of an exclusive right to provide a service to the public). This situation is 
compounded by the fact that in practice contractual arrangements between a public authority and a private 
supplier may combine different elements. In a few cases, however, WTO Members have scheduled specific 
commitments on concessional arrangements, presumably as limitation on the conditions under which 
foreign suppliers may participate in the market for the services concerned. This would imply a view that 
such arrangements fall within the scope of existing disciplines. Implications of misinterpreting the scope of the GATS 147. 
These uncertainties have tended to cloud discussions on the impact of the GATS on network 
infrastructure services, possibly affecting WTO Members' decisions to schedule commitments in these 
services. However, as pointed out by Adlung (2005), a key question that results from uncertainties on the 
interpretation of the scope of GATS provisions, is the extent to which GATS obligations and commitments 
could lead to a loss of policy control over the provision of these services. As seen earlier, if commitments 
have not been made in a particular sector, only limited disciplines apply, the most important of which is the 
MFN principle (provided that countries have not included the sector in question in their lists of MFN 
exemptions). MFN treatment does not seem to impinge on governments' ability to retain regulatory 
controls over network infrastructure services, given that governments retain the right to exclude any 
foreign participation in the services concerned. 148. 
Even if a country has made a commitment, Members retain a wide degree of flexibility and 
latitude with respect to regulatory measures, although other more significant GATS obligations apply 
especially in relation to market access and national treatment. While commitments involve different levels 
of access depending on the limitations entered in the schedules, misinterpretation of GATS provisions may 
in such case have important implications. As a last resort, if a country were to introduce new monopoly 
rights in an area in which it had previously made commitments to competitive supply, it would be 
necessary to follow the procedures on modification and withdrawal of commitments contained in GATS 
Article XXI. This would entail the negotiation of commercial equivalent compensatory adjustments to the 
schedule of commitments. If trading partners are not satisfied that such adjustments are made, they can 
ultimately be authorised to take retaliatory measures of commercially equivalent effect. 149. 
Uncertainties could also arise with respect to national treatment commitments. It is unclear, for 
example, whether national treatment would apply to certain types of treatment or privileges extended to 
public facilities (e.g. postal administrations), in a manner that could require equal treatment of foreign 
services and service suppliers supplying similar services. Such questions can arise with respect to financial 
benefits such as subsidies or "bail outs", discriminatory pricing controls, or preferences extended to the TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 41 services or suppliers concerned. As seen in Part I, subsidies and other incentives are frequently used to 
meet universal access objectives in network infrastructure services. It is possible that where such 
commitments are made these incentives may need to be offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all 
suppliers (domestic and foreign) willing to contribute to universal service objectives. 150. 
Implications for commitments could also arise if in the future certain kinds of contractual 
arrangements between the public and private sectors were interpreted as falling outside the scope of 
government procurement. If relevant commitments are or were to be taken, a Member concerned would 
need to grant foreigners the right to bid for contracts in the relevant sector and treat their offer like that of 
other national suppliers. Although it is difficult to see how foreign providers would be less suited than their 
domestic counterparts to meet the relevant sector objectives or to bid for contracts to provide service, 
governments should be aware of unintended consequences. 151. 
Scheduling commitments on network infrastructure services thus raises a number of important 
questions. At the same time, not committing may come at a cost. As seen earlier, GATS commitments in 
these services could bring about gains in terms of increased investment via private sector participation and 
wider availability of services, and thus can make a positive contribution to the fulfilment of the universal 
service objectives laid out by many governments. Moreover, in competitive telecommunication 
environments, for example, the concept of "universal" service has been nearly entirely delinked from the 
notions of governmental or exclusive supply, such that competitive private sector market participants can 
be assigned to assume these requirements consistently with GATS obligations or commitments. Limitations on network infrastructure services commitments 152. 
Pending a clarification of GATS provisions by the WTO membership, one option to avoid some 
of these concerns and facilitate the assumption of GATS commitments may involve careful delineation of 
the activities listed as open to competition and considerable thought given to relevant limitations to be 
inscribed in network infrastructure services. As shown in Table 1 below, WTO Members have wide 
flexibility in this regard. It is possible to confine the scope of commitments to clearly defined and 
circumscribed segments or activities of a sector, for example excluding public monopolies or confining 
specific commitments to the private sector. 153. 
A great degree of flexibility with respect to scheduling can accommodate governments that so 
wish to gradually move from monopoly service provision to the introduction of competition and private 
sector participation. This includes the use of staged or phased-in commitments to end monopoly or 
exclusive rights provision of certain of these services at a future date. WTO Members made extensive use 
of phased-in commitments in the telecommunications sector during the Uruguay Round. 47 of the 105 
Members that have made commitments on telecommunication services made use of such phase-ins, giving 
them breathing room to institute the necessary legislative and regulatory frameworks for the introduction 
of competition. 154. 
At the same time, it is important to recognise that the GATS cannot solve the issue of universal 
access to network infrastructure services. It can only play a role in complementing policy decisions by 
enhancing investor's confidence when countries decide to introduce competition and allow private sector 
participation in these services. Domestic factors including the state and feature of the different sectors, and 
the country's economic, social and political characteristics remain central. There are plenty of examples of 
countries that have made full GATS commitments during the Uruguay Round which have had no impact 
on their network infrastructure services. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 42 Table 1. Examples of limitations in WTO Members' commitments* Member

Additional disciplines on regulatory measures 155. 
Once commitments in a particular sector have been made, in addition to the market access and 
national treatment obligations (subject to scheduled limitations), other disciplines apply. The most 
significant of such disciplines relate to regulatory measures and are contained in Article VI, in particular 
paragraphs 1 and 5. The question arises whether these disciplines can limit governments' ability to regulate 
network infrastructure services. 156. 
Article VI:1 requires Members to ensure that regulatory measures are  " administered in a 
reasonable, objective and impartial manner " . Article VI:5 aims at ensuring that licensing, qualification 
requirements and technical standards are inter alia  " based on objective and transparent criteria "  (examples 
given are competence and the ability to supply the service) and  " not more burdensome than necessary to 
ensure the quality of the service " . These criteria are based on Article VI.4, which provides for a negotiating 
mandate to develop strengthened disciplines on these measures. The application of Article VI:5 is subject 
to two limitations, that the measures in question nullify or impair specific commitments and could not 
reasonably have been expected when commitments were made. 157. 
As noted by Adlung (2005), it is difficult to see how the provisions of Article VI:1 may impinge 
on governments' right to regulate given that they only relate to the  " administration "  of the measures and 
not their substantive aspects. Article VI:5 may have a wider impact on regulatory capacity since as seen 
above does contain substantive obligations. In this context, concerns have been raised about the fact that 
the not more burdensome than necessary test of Article VI:4 is linked only to the quality of service (see 
also Trachtman, 2003). A narrow interpretation of the objective  " quality of service "  may leave out 
measures relating to other important objectives seen in Part I. In practice, however, the effects of Article 
VI:5 are likely to be limited given that its application is subject to the two limitations seen earlier. In 
addition, current discussions under the Article VI:4 mandate show that any disciplines in this area will be 
broad enough to accommodate a wide range of national objectives. In the Accountancy Disciplines 11 , the 
one area where negotiations have been concluded under the mandate, the narrower quality objective has 
been replaced with a broader set of objectives, including protection of consumers, the quality of service, 
professional competence and the integrity of the profession. 158. 
It is also important to recall that even if a Member breaches its obligations under Article VI.5 (or 
other GATS provisions such as the ones to be developed under the Article VI:4 mandate), its regulation 
might still be permitted under the provisions of Article XIV on exceptions. The Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications 159. 
Another important example of GATS disciplines and the scope for autonomous policy making in 
network infrastructure services is the Reference Paper. The document is a tool for negotiating additional 
commitments on basic telecommunication services under GATS Article XVIII (i.e. beyond those on 
market access and national treatment). Unlike the Annex on Telecommunications, the Reference Paper 
obtains legal status only to the extent that WTO Members have incorporated it in their schedules of 
commitments. 160. 
The Reference Paper supplements other GATS disciplines, particularly the Annex on 
Telecommunications and Article VIII of the GATS. Its objective is to ensure effective market access by 11 The Accountancy Disciplines were adopted in December 1998 and are due to be integrated into the GATS at the 
conclusion of the current negotiations. They are applicable only if a Member has made a commitment in the 
accountancy sector and their scope is confined to measures not falling under Articles XVI and XVII. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 44 means of additional commitments to put in place a set of pro-competitive regulatory principles akin to 
international best practice. As seen in Part I, ensuring the development of a genuinely competitive market 
can be important because the particular characteristics of telecommunication services (and of other 
network infrastructure services), make it unrealistic to change from monopoly to open, unregulated 
markets, and expect the full benefits to be realised and sustained. Rather, a regulatory environment that 
complements and supports the decision to permit competition is needed. 161. 
The Reference Paper, like the Annex on Telecommunications, represents a transfer of know-how 
from countries with significant years of experience with reform of their telecommunication service sector 
to other countries and has been used to promote policy reforms and FDI. It has also inspired considerable 
debate on whether its elements can be transferred to other network services, such as postal/courier and 
energy services. The argument is that, given the changing market structure and gradual opening of these 
sectors to competition, regulatory authorities are likely to face issues that are similar to those encountered 
in the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector. Attention, though, should be paid to the differences 
between telecommunications and the other sectors, including with respect to the stronger difficulties 
encountered in conducting liberalisation in the other sectors (as seen in Part I). 162. 
Specific competition-related disciplines in the Reference Paper include a requirement to prevent 
major suppliers from engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation and an obligation to establish an 
independent regulator. At the same time, the Reference Paper, in line with the Preamble of the GATS, 
recognises governments' right to regulate the sector to ensure public policy objectives. A case in point is 
universal service requirements; the Reference Paper explicitly confirms the right of Members to establish 
these measures. Similarly, it allows considerable scope for each country on how to implement 
liberalisation and regulatory reform. For example, the requirement for an independent regulator is without 
prejudice as to whether the regulator should be separate from the ministry that makes telecommunication 
policy or whether it should be a sector-specific regulator of telecommunication services or a regulator 
operating under the general competition laws. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 45 CONCLUSION 163. 
The economic and social significance of network infrastructure services means that they are high 
on the list of development priorities of many countries. Part II of the report suggests that, if appropriately 
designed, bound liberalisation under the GATS can contribute to the advancement of these development 
goals. By creating a more transparent and predictable legal framework, the GATS can contribute to 
improve the investment climate and help attract FDI in these sectors. This can in turn provide needed 
capital and technical and managerial expertise to build and expand the networks and services. 164. 
The WTO services agreement can place regulatory constraints on Member governments, 
particularly when specific commitments are made. This is intensified by the fact that the GATS is a 
relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to be tested in practice. At the same time, the 
Agreement allows considerable scope through its flexibility to accommodate national policies. It is 
therefore crucial to carefully examine its provisions and tailor specific commitments to national policy 
objectives. 165. 
The liberalisation of network infrastructure services is no easy task and requires the 
establishment of a strong regulatory framework. To achieve public policy objectives and ensure 
competition in the new environment, new regulatory instruments and approaches are required, which need 
to be adapted to the specificities of different sectors and countries. This is shown in the range of positive as 
well as problem-ridden examples provided in Part I of the study of national experience in liberalising 
network infrastructure services. Sound regulation and effective institutions are thus needed to ensure a 
positive and sustainable outcome from the current round of GATS negotiations. TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL 46 REFERENCES Adlung, R. (2005),  " Public Services and the GATS " , Economic Research and Statistics Division, WTO,
