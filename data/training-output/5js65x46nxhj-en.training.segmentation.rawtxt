NEW INVESTMENT PROJECTS by Anthony de Carvalho, Naoki Sekiguchi and Filipe Silva OECD, Paris ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Government and industry representatives participating in the OECD Steel Committee are 
increasingly concerned about excess capacity in the global steel industry. Excess capacity has led to 
deterioration in the financial situation of steelmakers and is raising questions about its impact on the 
longer-term economic viability and efficiency of the industry. As a result, the OECD Steel Committee 
plans to deepen its work on excess capacity in the next biennium. This paper combines two documents 
that were declassified by the Steel Committee in early 2015, one that summarises the main policy issues 
regarding excess capacity and one which focusses on monitoring new steel investment projects taking 
place around the world. The Secretariat would like to thank all delegations that have contributed 
actively to the Steel Committee's activities on excess capacity, particularly those that provided very 
useful comments and feedback on the two papers that were combined to form this Policy Paper. 
Nevertheless, any remaining errors or omissions are the responsibility of the Secretariat. PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Governments participating in the OECD Steel Committee consider excess capacity as being one of the 
main challenges facing the global steel sector today. Following the Ministerial Council Meeting on 
6-7 May 2014, where Ministers stressed the need to address the issue of excess capacity in some industries 
such as steel, the OECD Steel Committee has deepened its discussions on capacity, and will take this work 
further in the next few years. To increase visibility of the key issues, the Steel Committee declassified two 
papers linked to excess capacity in early 2015. Those two papers have been combined to form this Policy 
Paper on excess steelmaking capacity and the implications of new investment projects. More specifically, this paper examines the extent, causes, and impacts of excess capacity in the global 
steel industry, and provides detailed information on new investment projects that are taking place around 
the world in order to help governments and industry better understand the extent to which excess 
steelmaking capacity may evolve in the future. For readers interested in knowing further details about 
investment developments taking place in the global steel industry, an Annex is provided that presents 
tables with detailed information on the companies that are investing and the financial amounts involved, 
the technologies being invested in, the ownership status of the projects and their expected starting date, as 
well as some qualitative comments about the projects to provide context where needed. The results indicate that global steelmaking capacity will continue to expand, with regions that are 
currently net importers of steel products expected to record the largest capacity increases. Of particular 
importance for governments in this context will be to work towards removing market distorting policies such 
as subsidies that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of failing companies. The main 
findings of this paper are: @BULLET Excess capacity remains high. The global steel industry's capacity to produce steel has more 
than doubled since the early 2000s to support growing construction and manufacturing activity, 
as well as to help build infrastructure particularly in emerging economies. With investment 
projects continuing to increase in a number of economies, and while steel consumption growth is 
anticipated to remain moderate, the global imbalance between capacity and demand will continue 
to pose risks for the industry for the foreseeable future, unless more concerted efforts are made 
by industry and governments to address the challenge. Global nominal steelmaking capacity is 
projected to increase to 2.36 billion tonnes by 2017, up from 2.16 billion tonnes in 2013. 
Non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry, 
with their share of world capacity expected to increase to 71.4% by 2017. 
@BULLET Government interventions are contributing to global excess capacity. Specific concerns 
related to government steel policies include continued government subsidies (notably subsidies 
for the creation of new capacity or the maintenance of inefficient capacities) and continued 
approvals for new steel facilities. Governments have also noted that trade related measures, 
constraints on foreign investment, and the activities of government financial agencies are also 
contributing to global excess capacity and creating difficulties for the industry in addition to 
weak market conditions. PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 6 @BULLET Excess capacity is hurting the global steel industry. Excessive levels of steelmaking capacity 
have important implications for the steel industry, resulting in over-supply, low prices, weak 
profitability, bankruptcies and localised job losses. Given the global nature of the industry, excess 
capacity in one region can displace production in other regions, thus harming producers in those 
markets and creating risks for trade actions and government interventions to protect domestic 
industries. It can also lead to wasteful energy use and thus have negative environmental impacts. 
@BULLET What should be done? In competitive economies, it is the responsibility of the steel companies 
themselves to identify ways to adapt to changing market conditions. The role of governments 
should be to allow market mechanisms to work properly and avoid measures that artificially 
support steelmaking capacity. Of particular importance for governments will be to work towards 
removing market distorting policies such as subsidies that promote the emergence of new 
capacity or delay the closure of failing companies, eliminating trade and investment barriers that 
slow the restructuring that is needed for the industry, allowing market-based investment decisions 
in the steel sector, and ensuring that new plants are subject to standards that protect the 
environment and uphold worker safety. 1. Introduction Excess capacity is one of the main challenges facing the global steel sector today. The growing gap 
between global steelmaking capacity and demand has led to deterioration in the financial situation of 
steelmakers, and has raised concerns about the longer-term economic viability and efficiency of the 
industry. Although excess capacity in the global steel industry has increased significantly since the 
financial crisis, and despite slowing demand growth in global markets, there continues to be new 
investment projects in many parts of the world. On the one hand, while the opening and closure of steel plants is usually based on the commercial 
decisions of private companies, government interventions that support the building of new capacity or keep 
inefficient facilities in operation can exacerbate the problem of global excess capacity and harm the 
business conditions of efficient steel producers in all markets. On the other hand, policies that promote the 
efficient restructuring of the industry or provide assistance to workers who may be displaced by the closure 
of uneconomic mills can be useful tools to address the problem and promote greater stability in global steel 
markets. Following the Ministerial Council Meeting on 6-7 May 2014, where Ministers stressed the need to 
address the issue of excess capacity in some industries such as steel, the OECD Steel Committee has 
deepened its discussions on capacity, and will take this work further in the next few years. 1 In addition to 
monitoring capacity developments, the Committee plans on examining government policies and their 
effects on global excess capacity, with an aim to reach a common understanding about which policies: 
i) promote a better functioning of the market and more efficient global steel industry; and ii) contribute to 
excess steelmaking capacity by distorting trade and competition in domestic and global markets. This paper examines the extent, reasons and impacts of excess capacity in the global steel industry, as 
well as the implications of new investment projects that continue to take place at a rapid pace in many parts 
of the world. By focussing on new investment projects taking place in the global steel industry, this study 
intends to help governments and industry better understand the extent to which global steelmaking excess 
capacity may evolve in the future. The information on individual investment projects presented in the 
Annex of this paper is also provided via an online database available to the public at 
www.oecd.org/sti/steel. 2 This Policy Paper finds that global steelmaking capacity will continue to expand, with regions that are 
currently net importers of steel products expected to record the largest capacity increases. Global nominal PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 7 steelmaking capacity is projected to increase to 2.36 billion tonnes by 2017, up from 2.16 billion tonnes in 
2013. Non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry, with 
their share of world capacity expected to increase to 71.4% by 2017. Of particular importance for 
governments in this context will be to work towards removing market distorting policies such as subsidies 
that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of failing companies. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next two sections briefly summarise the 
extent and reasons for global excess capacity. The fourth section provides an overview of steel projects 
currently taking place around the world, but leaves details about the types of equipment and furnaces that 
companies are investing in for the tables in the Annex. The final two sections summarise some of the 
OECD's work on the impacts of excess capacity and what should be done to address the challenge. Again, 
readers interested in the details of investment projects by company and region are invited to refer to the 
Annex or to the above-mentioned online database. 2. What is the extent of global excess capacity? The global steel industry's capacity to produce steel has increased rapidly since the early 2000s, after 
two decades of little growth. Most of the growth in steelmaking capacity has occurred in non-OECD 
economies, to support growing construction and manufacturing activity, as well as to help build the 
infrastructure necessary for the economic development of these emerging economies. The world's nominal 
steelmaking capacity is estimated to have reached 2 241 million metric tonnes (mmt) in 2014, according to 
the OECD Secretariat, a level that is more than twice as high as the 1 060 mmt capacity level observed in 
2000. With investment projects continuing to take place in many parts of the world, nominal global 
steelmaking capacity is expected to climb by a further 120 mmt in the period to 2017, bringing total 
worldwide capacity to 2 361 mmt. At that point, non-OECD economies are expected to account for 
approximately 71.4% of the world's total capacity (Figure 1). Figure 1. Nominal crude steel capacity in OECD and Non-OECD economies Source: OECD Secretariat. Whether or not excess capacity arises is a function of whether demand has kept pace with this rapid 
growth in supply. Although the industry is emerging from a severe cyclical downturn that was triggered by 
the global economic and financial crisis of 2008-2009, demand recovery has been uneven and sluggish in 
many economies. In 2013, crude steel demand stood at 1 648 mmt, or about 516 mmt below nominal 
capacity, representing one of the highest gaps in the history of the global steel industry (Figure 2). With 
investment projects continuing to increase in a number of economies while steel consumption growth is 
anticipated to remain moderate, the global imbalance will continue to pose risks for the industry for the 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

challenge. However, it is important to note that measures of excess capacity cannot be imputed directly from the 
gap between nominal capacity and demand. Indeed, it is not economic for the steel industry to run at full 
capacity, even when pricing is attractive and companies appear to be maximising their output. During the 
peak of the pre-crisis price upturn in the first half of 2008, for example, monthly global capacity utilisation 
did not rise above 91%. 1 Seasonal factors as well as the need to occasionally close down operations to 
refurbish steel plants and add new facilities tend to reduce the effective capacity of steel mills. Figure 2. World crude steel capacity (nominal) and demand Notes: The Secretariat assumes demand growth of 2% in 2014 and 2015. These are the most recent rates of growth forecast by the 
World Steel Association for world apparent steel use (October 2014 Short Range Outlook). Sources: OECD for nominal capacity and the World Steel Association for demand. 3. What are the reasons for global excess capacity? The main factors that contribute to capacity imbalances in the steel industry include market downturns, 
but also a number of government interventions and other market-distorting practices. As noted above, for 
most steel mills, it is normal to have periods of under-utilised capacity. When demand and prices of steel 
fall, profit-maximising firms should reduce production and thus leave a certain amount of capacity idle. 
Profits will tend to be lower because the firms still have to finance their fixed assets, including their under-
utilised steelmaking furnaces and rolling facilities. If the situation persists over time, however, then firms 
operating under normal market conditions would try to minimise their fixed costs by scaling back on 
capacity, thus making excess capacity a short-run phenomenon. History has nevertheless demonstrated that 
the adjustment process can be long and arduous in the steel industry, with some regions experiencing 
extended periods of excess capacity. 1 .

Capacity (LHS) 
Demand (LHS) PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 9 On the one hand, this can be due to high exit barriers, namely the costs of closure that discourage 
rapid adjustments in capacity. For example, capacity closures entail high costs of dismantling the mills, 
potential clean-up and other environmental and labour-related costs. In the face of market uncertainty firms 
may choose to delay exit rather than incur such costs. Expectations about future market conditions may 
also be contributing to current excess capacity; for example, steelmakers in some countries are investing 
heavily today in new steel production facilities in anticipation of much higher demand several years from 
now. On the other hand, excess capacity that persists over time can also be indicative of government actions 
that hinder adjustments that would normally occur in competitive markets. Due to the importance and 
strategic nature of the steel industry to many national economies, a tendency during market downturns is to 
preserve the capacity of the industry, in order to alleviate unemployment and other social problems that 
would otherwise occur due to capacity closures. In addition, in some large net steel-importing regions, 
governments are also interested in moving towards greater  " self-sufficiency "  in steel production in order to 
reduce their dependency on imports. Research by the Secretariat shows that, despite current market conditions, a 
large number of new projects are taking place, which will increase global crude steelmaking capacity 
significantly in the coming years. In the current context, recent discussions at the OECD Steel Committee have suggested that in some 
regions excess capacity reflects temporary factors related to the business cycle while in other cases it 
reflects structural factors connected to government interventions. Specific concerns related to government 
steel policies include continued government subsidies (notably subsidies for the creation of new capacity 
or the maintenance of inefficient capacities) and continued approvals for new steel facilities. Governments 
have also noted that trade related measures, constraints on foreign investment, and the activities of 
government financial agencies are also contributing to global excess capacity and creating difficulties for 
the industry in addition to weak market conditions. And finally, policy measures which discourage 
"optimal" exit of the least productive plants may also contribute to excess capacity. 4. Future investment projects in the global steel industry 4.1. Brief summary of regional investment developments Since the start of the 21 st century, many blast furnaces have been built around the world, particularly 
in Asia (see Box 1). That region will continue to lead BF/BOF capacity expansions, supported by large-
scale integrated projects. As a consequence, the BF/BOF route is likely to remain the major technology for 
iron/steelmaking, despite the announcement of many mini-mill projects in recent years. However, this 
paper shows that regional differences are very large. Detailed information can be found in the tables in the 
Annex, while a summary of key developments by region is provided below: @BULLET There are no capacity additions being planned in the European Union. @BULLET In the region referred to as  " Other Europe " , 3 crude steelmaking capacity is forecast to increase 
to 64.4 million tonnes per year (tpy) by 2017. All of the increase in this region will occur in 
Turkey, where many EAF projects are taking place. In line with EAF capacity expansions, 
imports of scrap are expected to grow further in  " Other Europe " . Iron ore imports into the region 
are also expected to increase to some extent as some projects are intensive in iron ore/coking coal. @BULLET In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, steel mills are replacing out-dated 
OHFs with BOF and EAF furnaces. Numerous EAF projects have been planned, which may 
result in higher future scrap demand. Nevertheless, the BOF process is likely to remain the main PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 10 production process in the region. As a consequence of several investment projects, steelmaking 
capacity in the region is expected to reach 152.9 million tpy by 2017. @BULLET In the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region, the share of EAF in steel 
production is expected to rise due to many DRI-based mini-mill projects, supported by the shale 
gas boom and the relatively low natural gas prices associated with this development. DRI is 
expected to be an increasingly important feedstock for producers in the region. Steelmaking 
capacity in the region is projected to increase from 158.0 million tpy in 2013 to 163.5 million tpy 
in 2017. @BULLET In Latin America, BOF's share is likely to grow in the future owing to many greenfield slab-for-
export projects, even though some projects have been postponed. Also, some projects in the long 
products segment are under way. As a result of these investment projects, steelmaking capacity in 
the region is forecast to reach 77.4 million tpy by 2017. @BULLET Although Africa is still reliant on imports to meet demand, some DRI-based mini-mill projects 
are expected to raise the region's self-sufficiency (domestic production as a share of demand) 
gradually. Steel production via the EAF route is expected to remain the major steelmaking 
process. Steelmaking capacity in the region is forecast to increase from 33.2 million tpy in 2013 
to 40.2 million tpy by 2017. @BULLET In the Middle East, steelmaking is expected to be predominantly EAF-based, and the preferred 
feedstock would remain DRI (due to natural gas availability). Many DRI-based EAF projects 
have been announced recently in the region, and are expected to contribute to reducing import 
dependency. The region's production capacity is projected to increase to 69.5 million tpy by 2017. @BULLET In China, steel production via the BOF route is expected to continue to play a dominant role in 
steelmaking. However, EAF's share could gradually increase in the future, along with the 
increasing availability of scrap, thus affecting the balance between BOF and EAF technologies. 
Steelmaking capacity in the country is expected to reach 1.1 billion tpy by 2017. 4 @BULLET Although EAF is still the major steelmaking process in India, BOF's share may increase 
significantly, supported by new investment projects that are iron ore/coking coal-intensive. The 
country's crude steelmaking capacity was estimated to have reached more than 100 million tpy in 
2013, and is expected to continue to increase to a level of 132.7 million tpy by 2017. @BULLET In ASEAN-6, BOF's share in the region's crude steel production is expected to increase 
gradually due to many BF/BOF investment projects. Therefore, iron ore/coking coal are expected 
to become important raw materials for the region. Scrap imports have also been increasing due to 
several mini-mill projects. The region's total steelmaking capacity is expected to increase to 
58.8 million tpy by 2017. PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 11 Table 1. Change in steelmaking capacity (million tonnes) 2013

Asia will continue to lead the capacity expansion in terms of the BF/BOF process Since the start of the 21st century, Asia has experienced a steel mill construction boom, supported by 
investments in many large-sized blast furnaces (with inner volumes of more than 2000 m 
3 ). The figure below maps 
blast furnaces with inner volumes greater than 2000 m3 in Asia compared to the rest of the world. As a consequence, 
Asian pig iron production expanded rapidly over the decade, rising from 361.3 mmt in 2003 to 900.2 mmt in 2013 and 
accounting for 77.0% of global pig iron production in 2013. Compared with other regions, Asian integrated mills are 
typically more modern and have a larger capacity. The region is expected to continue to lead the capacity expansion in 
the integrated steelmaking route, not least since the figure below indicates a trend towards ever-larger plants in Asia, 
but not in ROW. Source: OECD calculations based on data from World Steel Dynamics, China Iron and Steel Association, the Japan Iron and Steel

the world. However, the BF/BOF route has gained some importance in recent years. 5 Platts (2014b) 
recently reported that the Turkish government plans to reduce the domestic industry's dependency on scrap 
by providing more incentives for domestic iron ore and ferro-alloy production. This could encourage a 
change in the structure of steel production in favour of BOF based integrated mills. The Turkish industry 
aims to reach 85 mmt of steelmaking capacity and 70 mmt of steel production by 2023 (ISPAT, 2013). 
Major projects taking place in Turkey include: @BULLET Kardemir (one of Turkey's three integrated steelmakers) has begun to fire up its new blast 
furnace No. 5 with an inner volume of 1 280 m 3 at its Karabuk works in the northern part of the 
country. As a result, and also due to converter upgrades, its crude steel capacity is expected to 
increase to 3.4 million tpy. Habas has just entered the flat product market in Turkey with a new 
hot strip mill (2.5 million tpy of capacity) and is now building an electric steelmaking complex 
with a capacity of 3 million tpy. 4.2.2. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) In the CIS region, numerous mini-mill projects have been planned, reflecting good prospects for the 
construction sector at least before the recent political unrest. However, the BF/BOF route is likely to 
remain the main process in the region. 6 Between 2003 and 2013, the share of crude steel production via the 
EAF route has risen from 13.5% to 24.4%, according to World Steel Association data. The growth in EAFs 
(notably in Russia) should have a significant impact on scrap demand. Scrap demand may surpass 
domestic collection due to new EAFs, though some integrated producers — equipped with both BOFs and 
EAFs — have an option to increase the use of pig iron in their EAFs in order to reduce their dependence on 
scrap (Platts, 2012). Some important developments include the following: Russian electric arc furnace steelmaking is expanding and the government expects the share of EAF 
production to reach 39% by 2020 (Platts, 2014c). 7 Between 2013 and 2014, some long product mini-mills 
were commissioned to meet steel demand from the growing construction sector in the country. Abinsk 
Electrometallurgical Plant and NLMK Kaluga commissioned their new EAF melting shops, both with a 
capacity greater than 1 million tpy. Furthermore, Severstal aimed to begin commercial-scale production at 
its 1 million tpy mini-mill in Balakovo (in central Russia's Saratov region) by the end of the second quarter 
of 2014. 4.2.3. North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) In NAFTA, some steelmakers are exploring opportunities for building DRI-based plants. Several DRI 
plant projects have been announced in recent years to take advantage of shale gas developments. DRI 
provides opportunities for mini-mill steelmakers to minimize the impact of typically more volatile steel 
scrap markets (AMM, 2013). Growing DRI production is also likely to affect demand for substitute 
materials such as pig iron and scrap. EAF's share of steel production in the NAFTA region is expected to 
rise due to both DRI and scrap-based EAF projects. The upstream (crude) projects that are underway in the 
region include: @BULLET Some DRI technology suppliers forecast DRI capacity in the United States could reach 
10 million tpy by 2020 (Platts, 2014d and 2014e). On 24 December 2013, Nucor commissioned 
its first DRI facility with a capacity of 2 million tpy in Louisiana. Moreover, the European PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 13 integrated steelmaker Voestalpine is investing USD 740 million to build a 2 million tpy DRI 
plant in Texas. Also, Big River Steel broke ground on its USD 1.3 billion EAF-based steel mill in 
Osceola, Arkansas on 24 September 2014. 
@BULLET In Mexico, some mini-mill projects are underway to meet growing demand from the construction 
sector. For example, Talleres y Aceros (Tyasa) has been testing its new EAF with a capacity of 
1.2 million tpy in Orizaba. In addition to this, Altos Hornos de México (Ahmsa)'s 1.5 million tpy 
EAF, (part of its USD 1.5 billion Fenix program) is expected to be commissioned in 2014. 
Gerdau Corsa's new EAF plant is expected to come on stream in 2015. 4.2.4. Latin America In Latin America, many greenfield slab-for-export projects have been announced by major mining 
groups. However, some projects have been postponed due to reasons such as the global economic 
slowdown, weak markets and logistical problems. Most of the capacity expansion projects in Latin 
America will occur in Brazil, where some new slab projects are currently in progress. Some projects in the 
region are starting in the long products segment to meet demand for construction steel. Major projects 
occurring in Brazil are provided below. @BULLET Future slab maker Companhia Siderúrgica do Pecém (CSP) is a joint venture between Brazilian 
mining group Vale (50%) and Korean steel producers Dongkuk Steel (30%) and POSCO (20%). 
The project is expected to begin producing 3 million tpy of slabs in December 2015. CSP's first 
export shipment is scheduled for March 2016 through the Port of Pecém, in north-eastern Ceará 
State. Apart from this project, another two slab projects — Acos Laminados do Para plant 
(ALPA) and Companhia Siderurgica Ubu (CSU) — have been planned in the country. 8 4.2.5. Africa Currently, Africa is aiming to lower its dependence on imports through various upstream projects. 
Although Egypt and South Africa have played a key role in supplying steel products in Africa, the region 
still has a low self-sufficiency rate. To increase its self-sufficiency and press forward with industrialisation, 
many upstream projects (mainly DRI based mini-mill plants) have been planned. These projects are 
concentrated in North Africa and have the objective of supplying steel for housing and infrastructure 
projects. The DRI-EAF route has been the preferred steelmaking technology in the region due to its lower 
capital expenditure requirements and because the region has a shortage of steel scrap. 9 Projects taking 
place in some of the major producing countries in Africa include: @BULLET Many DRI-EAF projects are underway in Egypt. However, the country is experiencing a shortage 
in natural gas allocation, which has delayed the launch of a number of steelworks. 10 Ezz Steel, the 
largest steel producer in Egypt and North Africa, is expected to commission its 1.8 million tpy 
DRI plant and a 850 000 tpy EAF by end-2014. Moreover, Beshay Steel, the second largest 
steelmaker in Egypt, is building a 1.76 million tpy DRI and 1.3 million tpy EAF. Egyptian Steel 
is building an EAF-based steelworks in Beni Suef and Sokhna that will each have a capacity of 
850 000 tpy of square billet. 
@BULLET Algeria is one of the fastest steel-consuming markets in Africa due to government plans to build 
infrastructure facilities (OECD, 2014). With domestic steelmakers not producing enough to meet 
growing demand for steel, the government announced in mid-2011 that it would invest 
considerable amounts over five years to boost domestic steel production (Oxford Business Group, 
2012). Most of the capacity additions will be implemented by state-owned companies. For 
example, the governments of Qatar and Algeria have decided to enter into a joint venture, the PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 14 Algerian Qatari Solb Company. Moreover, state-owned Sider and ArcelorMittal aim to boost 
capacity at their Annaba plant. 
@BULLET In South Africa, ArcelorMittal South Africa is a major producer, accounting for more than 70% 
of the country's steel production (Kumba Iron Ore, 2011). However, large scale steel plant 
projects have been announced in the country recently. China's state-owned Hebei Iron & Steel 
(Hegang) announced plans to build a 5 million tpy greenfield steelworks to be supplied by output 
from its iron ore mine in the country. 11 On 10 September 2014, Hegang signed a memorandum of 
understanding with China-Africa Development Fund and the South African government's 
Industrial Development Corp. for developing Hegang's steelworks project in South Africa. This 
steel plant will be China's largest steel mill outside the Chinese mainland (WSJ, 2014). 4.2.6. Middle East With oil-exporting countries within the Gulf Cooperation Council aiming to diversify their economies 
(IMF, 2014), steel demand from downstream industries is expected to expand in the region. Many projects 
have been announced recently in the Middle East, often with the objective to reduce import dependency. 12 
However, these developments have led to concerns that the industry's expansion might lead to over-supply 
issues in the region, particularly in the square billet market (Metal Expert, 2014a). Steelmaking is 
predominantly EAF-based, and the preferred feedstock is DRI, owing to plentiful (and thus relatively low 
priced) natural gas availability in the region. 13 DRI is generally expected to remain a major feedstock in 
EAF steelmaking, and the EAF process, in turn, is expected to continue to play a dominant role in 
steelmaking route in the region. Major projects taking place in the Middle East include: Iran aims to expand its steelmaking capacity to 55 million tpy by 2025 (Reuters, 2014). Most new 
plants will be based on the DRI-EAF route. The country has significant resources of iron ore deposits and 
low-cost natural gas, and these factors are affecting the choice of raw materials used to produce steel in 
Iran. Although eight new steelworks have been under construction by state-owned IMIDRO since 2006, 
and numerous projects have been announced, a number of projects were put on hold because of financing 
constraints caused by economic sanctions. 14 Currently, Middle East Mines Industries Development Holding 
Company (MIDHCO) is involved in three greenfield projects in the country: Butia Steel Company (BISCO), 
Sirjan Iranian Steel Company (SISCO) and Zarand Iron & Steel Company (ZISCO). In Oman, growing steel demand (driven by construction activity) is encouraging domestic producers 
to increase their capacities and is attracting new investors to the steel industry. Scrap consumption is 
expected to grow due to capacity expansion projects, while some companies plan to install DRI modules 
because domestic scrap collectors may not be able to supply enough material for several years (Metal 
Expert, 2014b). An example of capacity expansion projects can be found in Jindal Shadeed Iron and 
Steel's project, which involves a 2 million tpy EAF steelmaking complex, including a DRI module. Sun 
Metals and Moon Iron & Steel (MISCO) also plan to install EAF facilities. Saudi Arabia is currently experiencing fast-growing demand for electricity driven by population 
growth and industrial development (NOREF, 2013). Although a shortage in natural gas allocation and 
electricity generation capacity has delayed the launch of a number of steelworks in the country, many EAF 
projects are currently underway to balance billet imports. 15 For example, Saudi Iron & Steel Company, the 
largest integrated steelmaker in the Middle East, started trial runs at its sixth electric arc furnace of 
1 million tpy in February 2014. Also, Arkan Steel and Al Atoun Steel are building EAF-based plants. 4.2.7. China Currently, the Chinese government is making efforts to restructure the steel industry, increase its 
efficiency and remove some excess capacity (EY, 2014). In October 2013, China's State Council released PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 15 a Guideline (the Guideline to Resolve Serious Overcapacity), targeting the closure of 80 million tpy of 
steel capacity by the end of 2017 (OECD, 2014), in addition to addressing overcapacity problems in the 
cement, aluminium, plate glass and shipbuilding industries. Targets of the plan include reasonable capacity 
utilisation, improved industrial concentration and structure, higher development quality, efficient 
environmental protection, a normal level of profit margin and asset-liability ratio, and a long-term effective 
mechanism in self-regulating capacity. The Guideline to Resolve Serious Overcapacity includes supply-side management measures, notably 
the prohibition of new steel projects, the removal of existing illegal capacity, the enhancement of the entry 
threshold, and phasing out the backward capacity by raising prices of power and water. Financial support 
could be provided if difficulties linked to capacity shutdowns and unemployment arise. In addition, broad 
demand side measures as well as systematic management measures will also be used to address 
overcapacity. On the demand side, efforts will involve the construction sector's use of steel and improving 
the standards of steel. Systematic management includes encouraging mergers and acquisitions of 
enterprises to increase industrial concentration and reduce over-competition, among other efforts. Since July 2014, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has revealed lists 
of steelmakers that should remove obsolete capacities. 16 Also, provincial governments were requested to 
submit, by 30 June 2015, their targets for dismantling outdated and excess capacities in 2015 and during 
the 13 th five-year (2016-2020) economic development plan (MIIT, 2014). 17 Some important coastal steelworks have been put into operation over the last few years in China: 
Anshan Iron & Steel commissioned its 6.5 million tpy Bayuquan works in Liaoning Province in 2008, 
while Shougang Jingtang United Iron & Steel completed its 9.7 million tpy works in Hebei Province in 
2010. Many projects have been announced in resource-rich inland regions. For example, Xinjiang's rich 
raw material resources have attracted many steelmakers to invest in new capacities in the region. 18 
Although the BOF production process will remain the dominant production process in China in the years to 
come, the EAF share may increase gradually along with increasing availability of domestic scrap, but the 
process is likely to take some time (Japan Metal Bulletin, 2014). 19 Despite a slowdown in China's capacity 
growth rate compared to previous years, large steelworks that focus on the production of flat products are 
being built in the country, namely: Baosteel could commission the first of two 5 050 m 3 blast furnaces at its Zhanjiang steelworks 
(Guangdong Province) by the end of September in 2015. The entire steelworks is expected to be 
commissioned by June 2016. 20 On 26 September 2014, Wuhan Iron & Steel Group set up the 
Fangchenggang Steel Company Limited that would be responsible for the operations management of its 
steel project in Guangxi Province. The new integrated steelworks is designed to be able to produce 
9.2 million tpy of crude steel with two 5 200 m 3 blast furnaces. Shandong Iron and Steel Group plans to 
launch its 8.5 million tpy Rizhao steelworks in Shandong Province by the end of 2016, with two 5 100 m 3 
blast furnaces. @BULLET Other important projects are either underway or being planned. In China's Inner Mongolia, 
Baotou Iron & Steel plans to build two 4 000 m 3 blast furnaces at a new integrated flat steel 
works, which will have a crude steel capacity of 5 million tpy. Also, on 4 July 2014, a 
memorandum of understanding for a total investment of USD 3.3 billion was officially signed 
between Chongqing Iron & Steel (Chonggang) and POSCO. The two companies will cooperate 
to construct a plant using POSCO's FINEX technology. PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 16 4.2.8. India Based on forecasts for steel consumption, India's authorities expect that steelmaking capacity may 
have to increase to 300 million tpy by 2025-26 in order to meet future demand (Government of India, 
Ministry of Steel, 2013). In order to reach that level of capacity, the industry may need to invest around 
12 trillion rupees, according to some news sources, with investment being concentrated in the mineral-rich 
states of Odisha and Jharkhand (Platts, 2014i). New investment projects that are iron ore/coking coal 
intensive should have significant impacts on the balance between BOF and EAF production in the future. 
Despite the declining trend over the last 10 years, BOF's share in Indian production is expected to grow 
significantly as many BF/BOF projects have been announced or are currently being built in the country. 21 
Many important BF/BOF projects are taking place in India, amongst which: @BULLET Some upstream projects are underway by state-owned companies that have already launched their 
strategic plans. 22 National Mineral Development Corp (NMDC) has delayed commissioning of its 
3 million tpy integrated steel plant with a 4 506 m 3 blast furnace, currently under construction at 
Nagarnar in the eastern state of Chhattisgarh. Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) is also building 
two blast furnaces with inner volumes of 4 060 m 3 at IISCO Burnpur works and Bhilai works. 
Also, India's leading private company, Tata Steel, expects to commission the first phase of its 
3 million tpy integrated mill by March 2015, including a 4 300 m 3 blast furnace. 4.2.9. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Although the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has traditionally been a large net 
importer of steel, a steel mill construction boom has been taking place in the region, as well as in other 
East Asian economies that export to ASEAN. 23 Many steel projects should support the increase in 
ASEAN's self-sufficiency rate. However, these developments have led to concerns that the industry's 
expansion might lead to over-supply problems (OECD, 2013a). DRI and scrap have been the major 
feedstock for steel production in the region because production takes place primarily in EAF-based 
facilities. However, BOF's share in the region's production is expected to increase gradually, thus affecting 
the balance of steelmaking technologies and, ultimately, raw material demand. Below is a brief summary 
of the major projects taking place in ASEAN. @BULLET In Indonesia, investment in new steelmaking capacity is taking place in view of relatively 
favourable demand prospects. Examples of investment projects include PT Krakatau POSCO, 
which formally began operating its first blast furnace (the size of which is 3 950 m 3 ) on 
23 December 2013 in Cilegon. The plant has a capacity of 3 million tpy. This project is part of 
Indonesia's Master Plan to accelerate economic development (OECD, 2013b). PT Krakatau 
POSCO will make a decision on whether to proceed with the second stage expansion in 2015. 
Moreover, PT Gunung Raja Paksi is building a 2 500 m 3 blast furnace with a capacity of 
1.5 million tpy in West Java, along with a sinter plant and a coke battery. 
@BULLET In Viet Nam, strong steel demand growth has attracted many foreign investors and numerous 
projects have been planned. According to the government of Viet Nam, capacity is targeted to 
reach 40 million tpy of steel billets by 2025 (Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam, 2013). 
Currently, some BF-BOF projects are underway in the country. For example, Formosa Ha Tinh 
Steel Corp has already started construction, with the first phase of a 10.5 million tpy plant to be 
fully commissioned by end-May 2017. 24 In addition, state-owned Vietnam Steel Corporation 
(VSC) has commissioned its new steel plant. Also, POSCO Specialty Steel aims to officially 
inaugurate its 1 million tpy EAF in Ba Ria-Vung Tau province either in December 2014 or 
slightly thereafter. 25 PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 17 5. Concluding remarks Excessive levels of steelmaking capacity have important implications for the steel industry, often 
associated with over-supply, low prices, weak profitability, bankruptcies and localised job losses. 
Recent work conducted by the OECD has examined the financial health of the steel industry and 
established a link between excess capacity and profitability. It has shown that the financial performance 
of the industry is perhaps worse now than it was during the global steel crisis of the late 1990s, in large 
part due to the significant excess capacity that exists today. Given the global nature of the industry, excess capacity in one region can displace production in 
other regions, thus harming producers in those markets and creating risks for trade actions and 
government interventions to protect domestic industries. It can also lead to wasteful energy use and thus 
have negative environmental impacts. Increased trade frictions are already visible amongst trading partners today. Subsidies and 
government support measures that promote investment in steelmaking facilities or sustain companies in 
distress that would otherwise shut down are a major source of this trade friction. Subsidies that 
encourage steelmakers to keep production running at high levels, even under weak market conditions, 
have had significant effects on trade, with unfair trade practices such as dumping having resulted in 
injury to the industries of other economies. In competitive economies, it is the responsibility of the steel companies themselves to identify 
ways to adapt to changing market conditions. That is, businesses are best placed to decide on when to 
invest in new capacity or when to scale it back when market conditions change. The role of 
governments should be to allow market mechanisms to work properly and avoid measures that 
artificially support steelmaking capacity. A key priority, therefore, is to identify appropriate policy approaches to address excess capacity. In 
this context, of particular importance for governments will be to work towards removing market 
distorting policies such as subsidies that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of 
failing companies, eliminating trade and investment barriers that slow the restructuring that is needed 
for the industry, allowing market-based investment decisions in the steel sector, and ensuring that new 
plants are subject to standards that protect the environment and uphold worker safety. The OECD Steel Committee has continued to deepen its discussions on capacity, and plans to take 
this work further in its programme of work and budget for 2015-2016. For example, the Committee's 
programme of work calls for analyses of government policies and their implications for global excess 
capacity developments, as well as maintaining a database of ongoing investment projects, including the 
sources of finance for steel projects and any government support measures provided. At a later stage, the 
Committee may consider organising a high-level meeting to facilitate discussion on excess capacity 
issues at a higher political level. A key aim of this work will be to establish common perspectives on 
ways to avoid practices that create harmful trade and competitive distortions, and which can lead to a 
long-lasting positive impact on the effective functioning of the global steel market. PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 18 NOTES 1. 
An important item discussed at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM), which was held in 
May 2014 and chaired by Japan, was about resilient economies and societies. The MCM Chair's Summary 
made specific reference to steel:  " Ministers also discussed positive shifts in employment and production 
patterns, the future of manufacturing as well as entrepreneurship, including the role of young firms and 
SMEs, and stressed the need to address the issue of excess capacity in some global industries, such as steel, 
in relation to supporting measures. "  2.

This comprises Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, 
Switzerland, and Turkey. 4. 
Recent reports suggest that China's actual crude steelmaking capacity could be higher than estimated. A 
Platts (2014a) report notes that Chinese capacity reached 1.11 billion tpy in 2013 and will increase to 
1.14 billion tpy in 2014, according to China Iron and Steel Association. 5. 
For example, Isdemir blew-in its No. 4 blast furnace with an inner volume of 2 500 m 3 in 2011. In 2013, 
scrap imports decreased by 12.0% to 19.7 mmt compared with 2012, while iron ore imports were up by 3.5% 
to 8.1 mmt, according to data from the World Steel Association. 6. 
According to the World Steel Association data, the share of BOF in the CIS region has grown to 67.7% in 
2013, i.e. by 10 percentage points from its level 10 years earlier. 7. 
The Russian steel industry is aiming to replace all of its OHF facilities by 2015 (Russian Steel Consortium, 
2013). Ukraine expects to complete the replacement of its OHF technology by 2018 (SE UEX, 2014). 8. 
These projects do not seem however to be progressing as expected. 9. 
The BOF to EAF ratio in South Africa is high (59:41), according to the World Steel Association data. This 
reflects the important role of iron ore and coking coal in the country. 10. 
Egypt has decided to remove natural gas subsidies, and some observers expect the price of gas used by 
cement, iron and durable good factories to increase by 30-75% (Al-Monitor, 2014). This measure will 
affect those steelmakers operating DRI modules that use natural gas. Observers have noted that scrap 
imports could increase due to natural gas shortage (Platts, 2013a). 11. 
Hegang already owns iron-ore mining assets in South Africa, having participated in a consortium 
established to buy Rio Tinto's 57.7% interest in Palabora Mining Company (Creamer Media, 2014). 12. 
Observers have noted, however, that the fast growth in power consumption may curb future capacity 
growth (Markaz, 2013). 13. 
According to data from the World Steel Association, the region's share of crude steel production via the 
EAF route has risen significantly to 92.4% in 2013 (9.3 percentage points higher than 10 years earlier). PP ON STEEL EXCESS CAPACITY & INVESTMENT 19 14 . 
Although the Iranian government is making efforts to attract private investors. See Platts (2014f) for more 
on this. 15 . 
Saudi Arabia's government aims to boost power-generation capacity by more than 50% from less than 
60 gigawatts (GW) to approximately 91 GW by 2020 (ABB, 2014). 16 . 
In July 2014, MIIT announced the first list of steelmakers that should remove obsolete capacities in 2014, 
including iron and steel and a total of 25.45 million tpy of ironmaking capacities and 22.60 million tpy of 
steelmaking capacities should be removed by end-2014. Furthermore, MIIT released the second list on 
18 August 2014 and the third list on 25 August 2014. 17 . 
This information is available at: http://cys.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11295023/n11297848/16159494.html 18. 
Observers have noted that the central government's keenness to develop western China's economy caused 
a rush of new steel projects in Xinjiang, which may lead to oversupply (Platts, 2013b). 19. 
China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) expects EAF output will be 25-30% of the total crude steel 
production by 2025 (Platts, 2014g). 20. 
The Guangdong Provincial Development & Reform Commission decided to remove 4.5 million tpy of 
crude steel capacity in the province by 2017, in order to make room for the Zhanjiang steelworks (Platts, 
2014h). 21. 
India has faced several barriers to capacity expansions. For example, the acquisition of land, the granting of 
environmental and forest clearances, the availability of raw materials and the lack of infrastructure are 
major challenges (OECD, 2014). 22. 
SAIL aims to increase its steelmaking capacity to 50 million tpy by 2025. On the other hand, RINL plans 
to expand capacity of its Visakhapatnam steelworks to 12 million tpy by 2020. 23. 
For example, in East Asian economies, operations at large-scale blast furnaces were started in both Korea 
and Chinese Taipei in 2013. 24. 
The commissioning of the No. 1 blast furnace with an inner volume of 4 350 m 3 is expected to be delayed 
until November 2015 due to the protests which occurred in May 2014. When fully implemented by 2020, 
this steelworks will be the largest integrated steel plant in the ASEAN region (OECD, 2013a). 25

Unspecific steelmaking unit In the tables below the  " Ownership "  column shows a distinction between state-owned plants or 
projects (S) and those which are privately owned (P). The status of a company's ownership was taken from 
the information sources used to update these tables and does not necessarily correspond to definitions of 
state ownership used within the OECD. Investment costs given in this list show are the total investment for 
each project. The volume of blast furnaces refers to the inner volume. The information on individual 
investment projects presented in this Annex is also provided via an online database available to the public 
at www.oecd.org/sti/steel. NOTE CONCERNING THE DATA While this document has been declassified by the OECD Steel Committee, some of the data in the 
following tables may have become outdated during the course of data collection and may not accurately 
reflect actual investment developments in the global steel sector. In addition, some current and future 
investment projects that are taking place may have been overlooked and thus may not appear in the tables.
