			<head>KEY MESSAGES<lb/></head>

			<p>• It is estimated that 16 % of the working age population in the EU has some form of permanent or temporary disability,<lb/> and the number of people with some form of disability is likely to increase as the population ages.<lb/> • Disabilities vary widely in type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset. These characteristics influence individual<lb/> capacities and willingness to become entrepreneurs and to sustain such a status. Self-employment is appropriate for<lb/> many in this population because it can provide more flexibility than paid employment in terms of workload, work schedule<lb/> and work location, which can allow for better management of disability and lifestyle.<lb/> • Efforts are needed to increase awareness about the desirability and feasibility of entrepreneurship by people experiencing<lb/> disabilities, both among disabled and non-disabled populations.<lb/></p>

			<p>• There is some evidence that targeted entrepreneurship training and start-up support programmes can be effective for<lb/> disabled people, but they are expensive to deliver and the size of the target group will not always justify separate provision.<lb/> • There is strong potential to adapt existing training and start-up programmes to the needs of the disabled. Business advisors<lb/> should be ready to recommend self-employment as a career option to the disabled, longer support should be available<lb/> if necessary, adapted formats (such as Braille) should be used, and language should be adapted to the realities of the<lb/> clients. Partnerships between business support organisations and specialist disabled support organisations can also help.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The benefits trap problem should be addressed by ensuring that the welfare system does not cut benefits too quickly on<lb/> transition to entrepreneurship or discriminate unfairly against those disabled people who chose to become entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The use of assistive technologies and improvements in IT and Internet accessibility for disabled business users should be<lb/> encouraged. The use of assistive technologies for entrepreneurs (brain–computer interfaces, computer readers for blind<lb/> people, etc.) can be favoured through grants, loans and training in their use. The integration of technological interfaces<lb/> for disabled people in key accounting, taxation and other business management software can be encouraged. Better<lb/> interfaces for disabled people on Internet websites are also needed, starting with improvements in accessibility of online<lb/> government services, such as business registration and tax filing, and promotion of standards for the development of<lb/> private websites that are friendly to disabled people.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISABILITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION<lb/></head>

			<p>Disability impacts a large number of people – approximately<lb/> 16 % of the working age population in the EU is afflicted<lb/> with a long-standing health problem or disability (<ref type="biblio">European<lb/> Commission, 2007</ref>). And this number will grow as the popu-<lb/>lation ages in industrialised countries due to the associated<lb/> increased susceptibility to mental and physical disorders (<ref type="biblio">Lutz<lb/> et al., 2011; Pascarelli et al., 2001</ref>). Disabilities are extremely<lb/> diverse and are not a fixed characteristic of individuals. Many<lb/> disabilities are invisible to the eye yet popular stereotypes of<lb/> disabled people as permanent wheelchair users or as blind<lb/> from birth persist.<lb/></p>

			<p>Disability affects a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes,<lb/> including labour market participation. People with disabilities<lb/> face many barriers in the labour market and disability is con-<lb/>sistently found to have a negative effect on labour market<lb/> outcomes, including employment rates and earnings (<ref type="biblio">Jones,<lb/> 2008; Berthoud, 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011; Lechner<lb/> and Vazquez-Alvarez, 2011</ref>). Variations in disability (i.e. type,<lb/> severity, quantity) influence labour market participation rates,<lb/> types of occupation and earnings (<ref type="biblio">Jones, 2008, 2011; Berthoud,<lb/> 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011</ref>). Locomotor impairments<lb/> exert a substantial negative impact on employment prospects<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Berthoud, 2008</ref>) as does mental health challenges and learning<lb/> difficulties (<ref type="biblio">Berthoud, 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Employer discrimination is a strong influence on the supply of<lb/> jobs for disabled people (<ref type="biblio">Meager and Higgins, 2011</ref>), although<lb/> employer perceptions about individuals&apos; capacity to work may<lb/> diverge considerably from their actual capacity to work.<lb/></p>

			<p>The risk of poverty in the EU is significantly higher for disabled<lb/> people than for people without disabilities – 21.1 % of disabled<lb/> people face that risk, compared to 14.9 % of people without<lb/> disabilities (<ref type="biblio">Hauben et al., 2012</ref>). The main reason for this dis-<lb/>parity can be found in the low employment rates of disabled<lb/> people, which are a cause for and/or a consequence of their<lb/> social exclusion (<ref type="biblio">Greve, 2009; Hauben et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> The European Union has taken a strong position to support<lb/> the active participation of people with disabilities in society<lb/> and the economy. This is evident in the Europe 2020 Strategy<lb/> (http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm), which aims to<lb/> create smart, sustainable and inclusive growth to build a soci-<lb/>ety that includes everyone. In addition, the EU has developed<lb/> a disability strategy (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2010</ref>), which<lb/> outlines actions to address specific barriers to full participa-<lb/>tion in society for people with disabilities (see Box 1 for more<lb/> information).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1 European Disability Strategy 2010–20<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<table>EU and its Member States have been given a strong mandate to address the social and economic situation of people<lb/> with disabilities by several charters, treaties and conventions, including:<lb/> • The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf), which<lb/> states the need to respect and protect human dignity, ensure the integration of people with disabilities in the community<lb/> (Article 26) and prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability (Article 21);<lb/> • The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/<lb/> TXT), which requires the Union to fight discrimination based on disability when drafting and implementing policies and<lb/> adopting legislation (Articles 10 and 19); and<lb/> • The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/con-<lb/>ventionfull.shtml), which is a legally binding instrument that protects and safeguards human rights and fundamental<lb/> freedoms of persons with disabilities.<lb/></table>

			<p>Following this mandate, the EU developed this strategy to empower people with disabilities to enjoy full rights and benefits<lb/> from participating in society. The strategy focuses on eliminating barriers for people with disabilities in eight action areas:<lb/> Accessibility, Participation, Equality, Employment, Education and training, Social protection, Health, and External action<lb/> (i.e. actions outside of the EU). To reduce barriers in these areas, a four-pronged strategy has been developed to raise<lb/> awareness; provide financial resources to support and research programmes; improve data collection and monitoring; and<lb/> implement the UN-required governance mechanisms across the Commission and with Member States.<lb/></p>

			<p>Entrepreneurship is indirectly supported by this strategy through the reduction of barriers under the &apos;Participation&apos; and<lb/> &apos;Employment&apos; themes.<lb/></p>

			<head>DEFINING DISABILITY<lb/></head>

			<p>Definitions of disability are shaped by two contrasting concepts:<lb/> the medical model of disability and the social model of dis-<lb/>ability. In short, the medical model treats disability as a char-<lb/>acteristic of the person and restrictions in activity are explained<lb/> in terms of individuals&apos; bodily capabilities, with impairments<lb/> treated implicitly as a form of negative human capital. In con-<lb/>trast, the social model of disability, pioneered by <ref type="biblio">Oliver (1990)<lb/></ref> assumes that people with impairments are disabled by societal<lb/> attitudes, institutions and environmental barriers rather than<lb/> individual characteristics. This model distinguishes &apos;impair-<lb/>ment&apos; (i.e. a limitation of the mind and body) from &apos;disability&apos;<lb/> (i.e. social exclusion) (<ref type="biblio">Shakespeare, 2006</ref>). These distinctions are<lb/> important because they influence the definition of &apos;disabled&apos; in<lb/> different contexts, especially within the context of eligibility for<lb/> support in public support and active labour market programmes.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no single definition of disability. The World Health<lb/> Organisation (WHO) International Classification of Functioning,<lb/> Disability and Health (http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en<lb/> and http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/training/icfbeginners-<lb/>guide.pdf) defines &apos;disabilities&apos; as an umbrella term referring to<lb/> impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions:<lb/></p>

			<p>• An impairment is a problem in body function or structure,<lb/> including physical impairments (e.g. dysfunction of the mus-<lb/>culoskeletal, neurological, cardiac, circulatory and respiratory<lb/> body systems); mental illness or disorder (e.g. schizophrenia,<lb/> neuroses and psychotic conditions, anxiety and emotional<lb/> disorders, phobias, depression); cognitive impairments<lb/> (e.g. brain injuries, dementia); sensory impairments (e.g. sight<lb/> loss or blindness); and intellectual or developmental impair-<lb/>ments (e.g. below average general intellectual function).<lb/> • An activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an indi-<lb/>vidual in executing a task or action.<lb/> • A participation restriction is a problem experienced by an<lb/> individual in involvement in life situations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Impairments, limitations and restrictions vary in terms of<lb/> numerous characteristics, i.e. type, severity, stability, duration<lb/> and time of onset. They may be stable, constituting a per-<lb/>manent condition, be slowly degenerative or impose episodic,<lb/> fluctuating or recurring restrictions on activities (<ref type="biblio">Boyd, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Longitudinal survey panel data from the United Kingdom sug-<lb/>gests that the status of being &apos;disabled&apos; is, for most, a tempo-<lb/>rary one (<ref type="biblio">Burchardt, 2000</ref>). The long-term disabled constitute<lb/> a relatively small proportion of working age people who experi-<lb/>ence disability; 27 % of those who reported a disability in the<lb/> UK indicated that they were impacted by the disability for seven<lb/> consecutive years (the length of the study) (<ref type="biblio">Burchardt, 2000</ref>).<lb/> Individuals may suffer from multiple conditions or impairments.<lb/> The onset of impairments also varies between individuals.<lb/> Some are born with an impairment while others acquire them<lb/> during childhood or adult life as a consequence of accident, ill<lb/> health or ageing. Impairment might occur suddenly or entail<lb/> a gradual deterioration in health over time. Evidence from the<lb/> UK indicates that only 11 % of the disabled adult population<lb/> is born with their disability, 12 % acquire it in childhood, and<lb/> 75 % become disabled during their working life (<ref type="biblio">Burchardt,<lb/> 2003</ref>). This highlights that no two experiences of disability<lb/> are the same; nor are disabled people equally disadvantaged<lb/> in the labour market.<lb/> Disability is therefore a complex phenomenon involving inter-<lb/>action between a person&apos;s body and the society in which they<lb/> live. Diversity in impairment and disability should discourage<lb/> the use of a simple binary division between &apos;the disabled&apos; and<lb/> &apos;the non-disabled&apos; for two reasons. First, the two populations<lb/> are fluid rather than fixed. A significant proportion of people<lb/> are affected by disability at some point during their working<lb/> lives. Second, disabled people are a highly differentiated group,<lb/> varying not only in terms of impairment characteristics but<lb/> also in terms of other personal and household characteristics<lb/> (i.e. gender, ethnicity, age, education, family structure) and<lb/> socioeconomic circumstances that influence labour market<lb/> participation rates (e.g. educational attainment).<lb/></p>

			<head>SELF-EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE<lb/> WITH DISABILITIES<lb/></head>

			<p>Data on labour market activities of people with disabilities are<lb/> limited. Available data are quite dated and comparability across<lb/> Member States can be problematic due to the different defini-<lb/>tions of disability used in different labour force surveys (<ref type="biblio">Greve,<lb/> 2009</ref>). Nonetheless, the available data suggest that people<lb/> with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed or inactive<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Pagán, 2009; Greve, 2009</ref>; Applica/CESEP/European Centre,<lb/> 2007). Those who are working are often employed in low-<lb/>skilled, low-paying occupations (<ref type="biblio">Meager and Higgins, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living<lb/> Conditions (EU-SILC) suggest that across the EU, people with<lb/> disabilities are as likely as those without disabilities to be self-<lb/>employed. However, people with disabilities are more likely<lb/> to be inactive in the labour market. Between 22 % (Austria)<lb/> and 78 % (Poland) of the population with identified disabilities<lb/> are not active in the labour market (Applica/CESEP/European<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Centre, 2007</ref>). This variation can be explained by several fac-<lb/>tors, including the generosity of disability benefits and the<lb/> ease of accessing them, the extent to which people with dis-<lb/>abilities are included or excluded from society and education,<lb/> employer discrimination, demographic factors and the incidence<lb/> of severe disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is large variation in self-employment rates of people<lb/> with disabilities across Member States. The self-employment<lb/> rates of people with disabilities are relatively low in many<lb/> north-eastern EU countries and higher in southern EU countries<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). For example, the self-employment rates for peo-<lb/>ple with disabilities in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark,<lb/> Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia were<lb/> below the 5 % level in 2007, while the rates exceed the 15 %<lb/> level in Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal and Romania.<lb/> Caution is needed in interpreting these data because the differ-<lb/>ences in self-employment rates across countries are influenced<lb/> by a number of factors, including variation in the definition of<lb/> disability used in collecting the statistics.<lb/> However, these data are largely consistent with many studies<lb/> that measure self-employment rates across a small number of<lb/> countries and for specific disabilities (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Blanck et al., 2000;<lb/> Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Meager and Higgins, 2011</ref>). For<lb/> example, a study of 13 EU Member States using the European<lb/> Community Household Panel data for the period 1995–2001<lb/> found that self-employment rates among disabled people were<lb/> higher than among people without disabilities (<ref type="biblio">Pagán, 2009</ref>).<lb/> This study found that the self-employment rates for people<lb/> with a disability varied across countries and by gender. Men<lb/> with disabilities were 10.5 percentage points (p.p.) more likely<lb/> to be self-employed in Greece than those without disabili-<lb/>ties, 8.6 p.p. more likely in Portugal and 8.1 p.p. more likely in<lb/> Ireland. In Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands the rates<lb/> were the same for disabled and non-disabled men. The male<lb/> non-disabled self-employment rate was higher than the male<lb/> disabled self-employment rate (3.0 p.p. higher) only in Belgium.<lb/> For females, those with disabilities were 13.5 p.p. more likely<lb/> to be self-employed in Greece, 10.3 p.p. more likely in Portugal<lb/> and 8.2 p.p. more likely in Austria. There was no difference in<lb/> self-employment rates for women with and without disabilities<lb/> in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are also differences in self-employment activities based<lb/> on the type and severity of impairment or disability. For exam-<lb/>ple, self-employment rates were higher among people who<lb/> were severely limited in their daily activities than among those<lb/> reporting some or no limitation in daily activities (<ref type="biblio">Pagán, 2009;<lb/> Jones, 2011</ref>). There is some evidence from the UK to sug-<lb/>gest that men and women with musculoskeletal problems, and<lb/> women with mental health problems, are particularly likely to<lb/> be self-employed, while men with sensory impairments are<lb/> relatively unlikely to be self-employed (<ref type="biblio">Boylan and Burchardt,<lb/> 2002</ref>). Data from the UK also suggest that disabled entre-<lb/>preneurs are more likely to work alone, rather than employ<lb/> others. Nearly 80 % of the self-employed with disabilities have<lb/> no employees compared to 74 % of those without disabilities<lb/> and non-work-limited disabled men (<ref type="biblio">Jones and Latreille, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Moreover, people with disabilities are more likely to operate as<lb/> a home-based business (East Midlands Development Agency –<lb/> EMDA, 2009).<lb/></p>

			<head>THE BENEFITS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR PEOPLE<lb/> WITH DISABILITIES<lb/></head>

			<p>Another important advantage of self-employment for those with<lb/> disabilities is that it provides a better adjustment between disabil-<lb/>ity status and working life through more flexibility in work pacing,<lb/> hours worked and location of work (<ref type="biblio">Prescott-Clarke, 1990; Callahan<lb/> et al., 2002; Doyel, 2002; Pagán, 2009; Jones and Latreille, 2011;<lb/> Meager and Higgins, 2011</ref>). Thus, self-employment can provide a<lb/> sense of self-empowerment because entrepreneurship can provide<lb/> a person with the opportunity to take control of their disability<lb/> and labour market participation, and be socially and economically<lb/> active to the extent possible for their situation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inspiring entrepreneurs: Veronica Hedenmark, Sweden<lb/></head>

			<p>Veronica Hedenmark is an entrepreneur from Gothenburg, Sweden. She has founded three companies, VH Assistants,<lb/> VH Action and VH Kids, which all specialise in providing personal assistance for children, youth and adults with disabilities.<lb/> Veronica was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is a congenital bone disorder characterised by brittle bones. By the<lb/> time that she had turned 9 years old, she had already suffered 152 bone fractures. Despite her condition, Veronica had a<lb/> very social upbringing and enjoyed attending public school. However, upon graduating from high school, Veronica watched<lb/> all of her friends move away to attend university or to work in foreign countries as au pairs. She was left behind, unsure<lb/> of how to take the next step in her life. Veronica was left confused and insulted when the Social Insurance Office offered<lb/> her an early retirement pension, implying that she would never be able to work. Rather than accepting it, she became more<lb/> determined to remain an active participant in society. Her boyfriend helped her understand the difference between having<lb/> a disability and being disabled, and this changed her perspective and outlook on life. The immediate result was a desire to<lb/> start and build a company.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 1996 she founded VH Assistants to help and inspire others that had disabilities. With the success of this company, she<lb/> subsequently founded VH Action and VH Kids to expand the scale and scope of her work. Today the companies have more<lb/> than 600 employees across Sweden.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to running successful businesses, Veronica is a successful advocate for people with disabilities and is a sought-<lb/>after speaker. In 2008 she was appointed ambassadress of the Swedish Minister for Enterprise and was a finalist for the<lb/></p>

			<figure>Göranpriset Prize. She won the Compass Rose in 2009, the King&apos;s award for young leaders and was named by Business<lb/> World magazine as one of the 100 Most Powerful leaders under the age of 40.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Inspiring entrepreneurs: Alan Broadbent, Spain<lb/> THE CHALLENGES FACED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES<lb/> WHEN STARTING A BUSINESS<lb/> • The benefits trap – surveys indicate that there is often a fear<lb/> of losing the security of regular benefit income when other<lb/> income is generated (<ref type="biblio">Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Doyel,<lb/> 2002; EMDA, 2009</ref>). Awareness of eligibility for benefits is<lb/> incomplete among the population of people with disabilities<lb/> and contributes to perceptions of self-employment as &apos;risky&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Lack of relevant business knowledge and skills</head>

			<p>– people with<lb/> disabilities often lack specialist business management, legal<lb/> and financial skills and knowledge due to limited relevant<lb/> education and employment experience (<ref type="biblio">Enabled4Enterprise,<lb/> 2008</ref>).<lb/> • Access to start-up capital – people with disabilities often<lb/> experience difficulties financing new start-ups due to lim-<lb/>ited personal financial resources (savings, home ownership),<lb/> which, in turn, are partly due to poor education and the con-<lb/>centration of disabled employees in low-paid occupations;<lb/> poor credit rating after long-term benefit receipt; disinterest/<lb/> discrimination on the part of banks; lack of accessible infor-<lb/>mation on sources of grants and loans (<ref type="biblio">Boylan and Burchardt,<lb/> 2002; EMDA, 2009</ref>).<lb/> • Consumer discrimination – self-employment can be deterred<lb/> by customer discrimination, reducing the demand for goods<lb/> and services produced, as well as the rewards to self-employ-<lb/>ment (<ref type="biblio">Boylan and Burchardt, 2002</ref>; <ref type="biblio">Jones and Latreille,<lb/> 2011</ref>).<lb/> • Increased labour costs – some entrepreneurs with disabilities<lb/> need to hire assistants to help them undertake tasks that<lb/> many people without disabilities may be able to do on their<lb/> own (e.g. moving merchandise, inputting data into computer<lb/> software), which increases their labour costs and puts them<lb/> at a competitive disadvantage (<ref type="biblio">Roni, 2009</ref>).<lb/> • Lack of appropriate business support services – this barrier<lb/> has a number of dimensions due to the individual nature<lb/> that disabilities have (<ref type="biblio">Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Doyel,<lb/> 2002; Pavey, 2006; Enabled4Enterprise, 2008; EMDA, 2009</ref>).<lb/> First, business advisers are often reluctant to recommend<lb/> self-employment as a career option for disabled people and<lb/> sometimes actively attempt to dissuade them. Such views<lb/> might be a consequence of advisers&apos; inadequate or stereo-<lb/>typical understandings of the activity restrictions arising<lb/> from specific conditions and/or misperceptions of support<lb/> recipients&apos; capabilities as well as a genuine regard for the<lb/> risks disabled people face in starting and running businesses.<lb/></p>

			<p>Second, and crucially, training is not always tailored to indi-<lb/>vidual needs and therefore of limited value to particular<lb/> programme recipients. For some, support might need to be<lb/> provided over an extended period of time for recipients with<lb/> recurring conditions or particular stresses. There is a percep-<lb/>tion among some support recipients that funders face pres-<lb/>sures to move quickly onto the next case rather than provide<lb/> longer-term support to those assisted (a &apos;tick-box culture&apos;).<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, support services may not be available in particular<lb/> formats (e.g. Braille), which makes the support service inac-<lb/>cessible for certain segments of the population of people<lb/> with disabilities. This likely will also impact the awareness<lb/> level of available supports.<lb/> Fourth, premises where support is provided may not be<lb/> accessible for individuals with conditions and impairments<lb/> that impact their mobility. Moreover, this barrier can be<lb/> increased by challenges related to transport to and from<lb/> support centres for those with mobility challenges.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fifth, support programmes may use language that is off-<lb/>putting to people with disabilities. For example, entrepreneurs<lb/> who experience disability often have lower growth aspira-<lb/>tions and may not identify with terms such as &apos;entrepreneur&apos;<lb/> because they do not see themselves as exploiting an oppor-<lb/>tunity or being innovative.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sixth, the diversity of impairment and disability means that<lb/> some disabled entrepreneurs might not perceive themselves<lb/> as &apos;disabled&apos; and prefer to be supported under mainstream,<lb/> rather than disability-specific, services.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is evidence that particular groups of disabled people face<lb/> multiple sources of disadvantage in European labour markets<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Greve, 2009</ref>). Disability is more likely to affect vulnerable<lb/> subgroups within society, for example, the old and the poor<lb/> (World Health Organisation/World <ref type="biblio">Bank, 2011</ref>) and people who<lb/> experience disability may face multiple forms of social exclu-<lb/>sion and sources of labour market disadvantage (<ref type="biblio">Berthoud,<lb/> 2008</ref>). Women, older people and ethnic minority and migrant<lb/> people who experience a disability are likely to face greater<lb/> levels of labour market disadvantage. Disability-related barriers<lb/> to entrepreneurship might, therefore, be compounded by gen-<lb/>der, ethnicity and age barriers as well as deprived socioeco-<lb/>nomic contexts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inspiring entrepreneurs: Yiota Michaelidou, Cyprus<lb/></head>

			<p>Yiota Michaelidou is an entrepreneur in Limassol, Cyprus. She operates a baking and confectionery workshop called<lb/> Paradosiakes Dimiourgies that produces traditional Cypriot-baked goods.<lb/></p>

			<p>Yiota started her career as a kindergarten teacher but attended night classes in bakery and confectionery for pleasure.<lb/> Soon after starting her career, she had an opportunity to put more time into baking while she was at home raising her two<lb/> children. It was around this time that Yiota began showing symptoms of Stargardt&apos;s Disease, a form of macular retinopa-<lb/>thy, a progressive eye disease that affects central vision. In recent years it has drastically reduced her vision to the point<lb/> where she can only read large print or read with the use of a closed-circuit television. She also uses special magnification<lb/> software to operate her computer. However, this does not impact her mobility greatly, except in unfamiliar environments<lb/> with bright daylight.<lb/> Despite the onset of Startgardt&apos;s Disease, Yiota continued to pursue her love of baking and sought employment at a con-<lb/>fectionery shop. She was successful in finding employment opportunities but never stayed long because she felt mistreated<lb/> due to her disability. This gave her the idea of starting her own business.<lb/></p>

			<p>She had a workshop constructed in her parents&apos; house to meet health and safety requirements, as well as her vision needs.<lb/> For example, the stove and mixing bowl have large numbers and are contrasting colours. This new workshop started as a<lb/> trial business, serving two hotels, a kindergarten and a few individuals. At busy periods, Yiota&apos;s mother provided assistance,<lb/> along with other women that worked on an hourly basis.<lb/> Impressed with the start-up operation, a social worker suggested that Yiota attend business and computer training courses<lb/> to help her expand her business. Yiota underwent a needs assessment and participated in small business training for persons<lb/> with disabilities offered by the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. One of the first steps that she took in launching her<lb/> business was to apply for a grant so that she can invest in two industrial freezers, allowing her to store large quantities of<lb/> frozen products in order to serve more customers. Yiota continues to grow her business and is working on a cookbook with<lb/> traditional delicacies of Cyprus, for persons with vision impairment.<lb/></p>

			<head>FACILITATING ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY<lb/></head>

			<p>Technology can help people with disabilities maintain an active,<lb/> independent lifestyle and to participate fully in society (<ref type="biblio">Sans-<lb/>Bobi et al., 2012</ref>). Within this context, these technologies are<lb/> referred to as assistive technologies, which are products that<lb/> increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of peo-<lb/>ple with disabilities. These technologies are wide-ranging and<lb/> include, for example, artificial limbs, retina implants and spe-<lb/>cialised computer software. The history of assistive technol-<lb/>ogy dates back to the early 1890s when the first hearing aid<lb/> was patented (Miltimore, 1892). In 1936, the first artificial<lb/> speech synthesizer was developed by H. W. Dudley for Bell<lb/> Laboratories (<ref type="biblio">Green and Blair, 2011</ref>). Bell Laboratories also<lb/> developed the first speech recognition system in 1952. In 1975<lb/> Kurzweil Technology invented the first optical character recog-<lb/>nition (OCR) technology, which allows the translation of written<lb/> text into digital language (<ref type="biblio">Green and Blair, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Current research and development related to assistive technol-<lb/>ogies concentrates on, for example, gesture-based input devices<lb/> for interaction with information systems (<ref type="biblio">Vatavu et al., 2009;<lb/> Christiansen et al., 2011</ref>), cloud-based assistive technologies<lb/> (e.g. screen readers or screen magnifiers) that allow disabled<lb/> people location-independent access to computer systems (<ref type="biblio">Hill,<lb/> 2011; Caldwell, 2011</ref>) and brain–computer interfaces that<lb/> allow the operation of computer systems or the control of<lb/> artificial limbs with one&apos;s mind (<ref type="biblio">McCullagh et al., 2010; Wolpaw<lb/> and Wolpaw, 2012; Carmena, 2012</ref>). While the first two tech-<lb/>nologies already have been successfully commercialised the<lb/> latter is still to be explored extensively.<lb/></p>

			<p>Assistive technologies are evolving at a rapid pace. Although<lb/> they are not directly aimed at supporting entrepreneurship,<lb/> these technologies can help someone in business creation in<lb/> three broad ways. First, improving an individual&apos;s ability to par-<lb/>ticipate in society increases their self-esteem and confidence,<lb/> increasing the likelihood of starting a business (<ref type="biblio">Seelman, 2008</ref>).<lb/> Collecting and managing information is critical for full participa-<lb/>tion in today&apos;s society and various assistive technologies enable<lb/> people with different kinds of disabilities to have access to<lb/> computer systems. Blind people can use Braille keyboards or<lb/> touch screens to scan digital information. The latter requires the<lb/> application of screen reader software that is capable of reading<lb/> out loud all of the information displayed on the screen. People<lb/> with physical disabilities, who are not able to operate com-<lb/>puter systems by mouse and keyboard devices, can use wands<lb/> and sticks to simulate keyboard functionalities or trackballs to<lb/> simulate mouse functionalities. Sip-and-puff systems allow<lb/> users to communicate with computer systems by using air pres-<lb/>sure on a straw, tube or wand (<ref type="biblio">Microsoft Accessibility, 2013</ref>). A<lb/> promising technology, especially for physically disabled people,<lb/> is the execution of computer actions and commands by speech<lb/> or eye tracking. This allows a more convenient and efficient<lb/> way to scan and gather information for people with certain<lb/> disabilities. Research is continuously evolving these techniques<lb/> to provide more accurate solutions to end users (<ref type="biblio">Paek et al.,<lb/> 2007; Beelders and Blignaut, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Second, assistive technologies can help people with disabilities<lb/> interact with customers and develop relationships with sup-<lb/>pliers, business partners and financers. Communication can<lb/> occur through different channels and the most disseminated<lb/> channels are e-mail, telephone or voicemail, face-to-face con-<lb/>versation, fax and letter (<ref type="biblio">Guffey and Loewy, 2008</ref>). Depending<lb/> on one&apos;s disability, an individual will prefer one channel to the<lb/> other. For instance, a physically disabled entrepreneur using a<lb/> wheelchair may prefer e-mail or phone calls over face-to-face<lb/> conversations if they require the disabled entrepreneur to visit<lb/> the business partner in an unknown and possibly inaccessible<lb/> area or building.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, technologies can help entrepreneurs with disabilities to<lb/> manage and control their business processes. In addition to the<lb/> information and communication issues already discussed, the<lb/> achievement of business objectives needs continuous planning<lb/> and monitoring. Much work is still needed in this area because<lb/> many business process management applications or enterprise<lb/> resource planning systems are incompatible with many acces-<lb/>sible technologies (<ref type="biblio">Vaziri and De Oliveira, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In addition to assistive technologies, information technolo-<lb/>gies (IT) can facilitate entrepreneurship for people with a dis-<lb/>ability. IT-accessibility became an important topic in the late<lb/> 1990s, when the US government amended section 508 of<lb/> the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (<ref type="biblio">Thatcher et al., 2006; Kline,<lb/> 2011</ref>), which now requires all IT purchased by the US govern-<lb/>ment to comply with specific accessibility standards. This was<lb/> followed by similar action by other governments (<ref type="biblio">Kline, 2011</ref>).<lb/> For example, the German government passed an equality act<lb/> in 2002, which summons the public sector to provide only<lb/> accessible websites and software applications (</p>

			<table>German Federal<lb/> Ministry of Justice, 2007).<lb/> Recent efforts on IT-accessibility focus on the generation and<lb/> acknowledgement of common international standards like Web<lb/> Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG, 2008; Kline, 2011),<lb/> which is a major prerequisite for the operation of many assis-<lb/>tive technologies. Even though EU policies were able to embody<lb/> laws that compel and standards that support public institutions<lb/> to provide IT-accessibility (United Nations, 2008; The National<lb/> Archives, 1995; German Federal Ministry of Justice, 2007;<lb/> WCAG, 2008; Kline<ref type="biblio">, 2011; W3C, 2006</ref>), several studies on web<lb/> accessibility in the EU found that very few public sector web-<lb/>sites meet these international standards. For example, a study<lb/> conducted in 2009 tested the conformance level of 102 public<lb/> sector websites and found that none of them met the WCAG<lb/> standard (<ref type="biblio">Cullen et al., 2009</ref>). An earlier study conducted by<lb/> the Disability Rights Commission in 2004 investigated 1 000<lb/> private and public websites and found that 81 % of the inves-<lb/>tigated websites did not fulfil basic accessibility requirements<lb/> (Disability Rights <ref type="biblio">Commission, 2004</ref>). These results have a<lb/> major impact on the individual person, information society<lb/> and business organisational perspective for disabled people.<lb/> They illustrate that current IT-accessibility is insufficient and<lb/> thereby does not support the inclusion of people with disabilities<lb/> in online activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the prominence of the Internet in today&apos;s society and<lb/> business environment, improving the accessibility of IT remains<lb/> a priority for the industry and government. Computer software<lb/> and the Internet are also increasingly essential for small busi-<lb/>nesses to help entrepreneurs manage tasks such as commu-<lb/>nication, inventory management and accounting. Furthermore,<lb/> many interactions between small businesses and governments<lb/> are now online. For example, in many EU countries business<lb/> registration and the filing of taxes can be completed online.<lb/> Governments and business support agencies also provide a<lb/> wealth of business support services and information through<lb/> online portals.<lb/> POLICY SUPPORT FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR PEOPLE<lb/> WITH DISABILITIES<lb/> Entrepreneurship can play a role in supporting participation in<lb/> the labour market and society for people with disabilities. While<lb/> entrepreneurship is not for everyone and may not be feasible<lb/> for those with severe or multiple disabilities, it is a feasible<lb/> option for many people with disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The approach taken to support labour market participation for<lb/> people with disabilities in the EU tends to favour increasing<lb/> participation through employment rather than self-employment<lb/> or business creation. A common approach in the EU is to use<lb/> employment quotas that require public and private organisa-<lb/>tions to employ a certain number or proportion of people with<lb/> disabilities; however, a number of countries such as Denmark,<lb/> Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the<lb/> United Kingdom do not use this approach (<ref type="biblio">Greve, 2009</ref>).<lb/> Recognising the range of disabilities and impairments, there<lb/> are several examples of policy actions that support self-<lb/>employment and business creation for people with disabilities.<lb/> This includes the incorporation of self-employment in general<lb/> active labour market programmes (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Ridley et al., 2005</ref>) as<lb/> well as schemes that are dedicated to supporting people with<lb/> disabilities in business creation. The priority areas for policy<lb/> development are discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Increase awareness about<lb/> the feasibility of entrepreneurship<lb/> Goal<lb/></head>

			<p>Relatively high self-employment rates for people with disabili-<lb/>ties in the EU suggest that there is an interest in entrepreneur-<lb/>ship and self-employment among this population. However, this<lb/> number in real terms is quite small because of the large number<lb/> of inactive people. Many people with disabilities are held back<lb/> to due a lack of awareness, lack of emotional support from<lb/> family and friends, low self-confidence and discouragement<lb/> from business advisors. Promoting the feasibility of entrepre-<lb/>neurship for people with disabilities will increase awareness<lb/> of entrepreneurship as a potential labour market activity, not<lb/> only for people with disabilities but also for others who have an<lb/> important role in supporting them. The aim of awareness crea-<lb/>tion should be to increase knowledge of self-employment and<lb/> small business ownership as a career option and the potential<lb/> benefits that it can offer. But it is equally important to increase<lb/> awareness of the challenges and risks that need to be consid-<lb/>ered so that individuals can decide whether it is appropriate<lb/> activity given their circumstances.<lb/></p>

			<head>Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>Promotion of entrepreneurship activities for people with dis-<lb/>abilities should aim to reach three target groups: people with<lb/> disabilities; their role models and support networks such as<lb/> family and friends; and business advisors. One method of<lb/> increasing awareness of entrepreneurship among people with<lb/> disabilities is to raise the profile of entrepreneurship and self-<lb/>employment in labour market support programmes. Many<lb/> labour market programmes for people with disabilities focus<lb/> exclusively on job placement, often within the public sector,<lb/> and ignore, or even discourage self-employment (<ref type="biblio">Boylan and<lb/> Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, 2002; Pavey, 2006; Enabled4Enterprise,<lb/> 2008; EMDA, 2009</ref>). It is important to provide enterprise aware-<lb/>ness training for advisers whose responsibilities include sup-<lb/>porting disabled individuals. This should be disability-specific<lb/> training rather than simply generic diversity training. This type<lb/> of training should seek to educate advisers on the possibilities<lb/> self-employment might afford disabled people as a work option<lb/> and must also cover the challenges and risks. In addition, it<lb/> should seek to overcome adviser reluctance to recommend self-<lb/>employment as a viable option. Increasing adviser confidence<lb/> to provide support to disabled entrepreneurs might, indirectly,<lb/> increase the confidence of the target group of entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Policymakers can also promote business creation for peo-<lb/>ple with disabilities using role models with disabilities. It is<lb/> important to showcase these inspiring examples for potential<lb/> entrepreneurs with disabilities to demonstrate that business<lb/> creation and self-employment can be achievable. These role<lb/> models should also be included in broader promotional cam-<lb/>paigns related to entrepreneurship and self-employment to<lb/> show that self-employment is not an atypical activity for people<lb/> with disabilities. This is important not only to individuals with<lb/> disabilities but also for addressing negative stereotypes and<lb/> attitudes in society.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another approach to increasing awareness is to promote entre-<lb/>preneurship through high profile awards for entrepreneurs with<lb/> disabilities. This provides public recognition for success and in<lb/> some cases financial rewards are provided to support further<lb/> business development. Awards are also an effective method<lb/> of attracting media attention to showcase success stories,<lb/> increase awareness of the potential for entrepreneurship<lb/> among people with disabilities and inspire potential entrepre-<lb/>neurs. An example of award programme is the Stelios Award<lb/> for Disabled Entrepreneurs (United Kingdom) which are admin-<lb/>istered in partnership with Leonard Cheshire Disability charity<lb/> (http://www.stelios.com/entrepreneurship/award-for-disabled-<lb/>entrepreneurs-in-the-uk.html). The awards receive considerable<lb/> media attention and provide financial rewards to help entre-<lb/>preneurs grow their business. The European Commission is also<lb/> active in this area, operating the European Enterprise Promotion<lb/> Awards (see Box 2) and sponsoring the First European Award<lb/> for Social Entrepreneurship and Disability (http://www.csr-d.eu/<lb/> social-entrepreneurship-and-disability-award).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2 European Enterprise Promotion Awards<lb/></head>

			<table>Target group: The European Commission, DG Enterprise and Industry operates the European Enterprise Promotion Awards,<lb/> which provide awards to entrepreneurs in six categories and a Jury&apos;s Grand Prize for the entry that is deemed to be the<lb/> most creative and inspiring entrepreneurship initiative in Europe. One of the six categories is for &apos;responsible and inclusive<lb/> entrepreneurship&apos;, which recognises regional or local actions promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainable<lb/> business practices. This includes support for people with disabilities and the 2012 winner of this category was a project<lb/> called &apos;Disabled at Work&apos; that was operated by a group of 16 organisations from Turkey and the Netherlands. It provides<lb/> training and mentoring for people with disabilities that seek to enter the workforce, either as an employee or through self-<lb/>employment. The 2013 winner in the inclusive entrepreneurship category was &apos;Integration of Disabled People&apos; in the Slovak<lb/> Republic, which provides driving training for people with disabilities.<lb/> Intervention type: Awards and recognition programme across the EU.<lb/> Objectives: The objectives of the European Enterprise Promotion Awards are to identify and recognise successful activities<lb/> and initiatives undertaken to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship; showcase and share examples of best entrepre-<lb/>neurship policies and practices; create a greater awareness of the role entrepreneurs play in society; and to encourage and<lb/> inspire potential entrepreneurs.<lb/> Entry requirements: Entries are made to national juries that each represent a Member State. Eligible entities can be national<lb/> organisations, towns, cities, regions and communities as well as public–private partnerships between public authorities and<lb/> entrepreneurs, educational programmes and business organisations. International initiatives are eligible as long as they are<lb/> nominated jointly by all countries involved.<lb/> Description: The competition has two stages. Applicants must first compete at the national level, where each country selects<lb/> two entries to be nominated for the EU competition. From these entries, a shortlist of nominees is chosen by the European jury.<lb/> Nominees for 2013 were selected based on the following criteria: (i) originality and feasibility; (ii) the impact that they have<lb/> on the local economy; (iii) the improvement of local stakeholder relations; and (iv) the transferability of the project to other<lb/> regions in Europe. All nominees from the national and European competitions were invited to attend an awards ceremony.<lb/> To raise awareness about the European Enterprise Awards, the European Commission works in partnership with several<lb/> European umbrella organisations, including the Assembly of European Regions, Committee of the Regions, Eurocities, European<lb/> Association of Economic Development Agencies, Eurochambres and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-<lb/>Sized Enterprises. Each organisation promotes the awards and nominees through their networks and communication channels.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Results achieved: Since the awards started in 2006, nearly 2 400 projects have participated in national competitions for<lb/> a chance to compete in the European Enterprise Promotion Awards. More than 30 projects have won awards and been<lb/> showcased across the EU to inspire others and to spread good practices. Together, nominated projects have created more<lb/> than 10 000 new companies.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2. Develop entrepreneurship skills<lb/> Goal<lb/></head>

			<p>Many people with disabilities have difficulty accessing educa-<lb/>tion and the labour market and, consequently, many have little<lb/> work experience and very few have experience with entrepre-<lb/>neurship. As a result, few people with disabilities have had the<lb/> opportunity to develop the skill-set needed to successfully start<lb/> and run a business. Supporting the acquisition of entrepreneur-<lb/>ship skills can help overcome this lack of experience. The goal<lb/> of entrepreneurship training for people with a disability is no<lb/> different than it is for the mainstream population – to increase<lb/> awareness of the potential of entrepreneurship, to deliver the<lb/> skills that will increase the chances of successfully starting<lb/> and operating a business and to develop an entrepreneurial<lb/> mind-set.<lb/></p>

			<head>Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>Policymakers can take two approaches to facilitate the develop-<lb/>ment of entrepreneurial skill-sets for people with disabilities.<lb/> One approach is to provide more support to people with dis-<lb/>abilities in the education system. People with disabilities are<lb/> only half as likely to complete vocational training or higher<lb/> education as people without disabilities and one of the principal<lb/> barriers is the lack, or inaccessibility, of assistive technolo-<lb/>gies which are rehabilitative, adaptive and assistive devices<lb/> that enable disabled people to perform particular tasks (e.g.<lb/> enabling mobility, allowing the use of specific artefacts such<lb/> as furniture and computer keyboards, facilitating communica-<lb/>tions) (<ref type="biblio">Hanafin et al., 2007; Nochajski et al., 1999</ref>). Improving<lb/> the availability and accessibility of these technologies is a<lb/> first step to increasing educational attainment that will lead<lb/> to increased skill levels and other individual benefits such as<lb/> higher self-confidence. This can have a positive influence for<lb/> entrepreneurship activities as higher educational attainment<lb/> for people with disabilities leads to better labour market out-<lb/>comes, including self-employment (<ref type="biblio">Zwerling et al., 2002; Christ<lb/> and Stodden, 2005</ref>).<lb/> Policymakers can also examine the wide variety of existing<lb/> non-financial supports to ensure that they are accessible for<lb/> people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that the content<lb/> can be accessed in non-standard formats and that programmes<lb/> allow for some flexibility in their delivery.<lb/></p>

			<p>Alternatively, tailored programmes for entrepreneurship<lb/> training can be developed such as &apos;Ready to Start&apos; in the<lb/> United Kingdom (see Box 3). This approach can overcome<lb/> the challenge of developing training programmes that<lb/> address the heterogeneity of impairment characteristics<lb/> (type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset). This<lb/> type of intensive, tailored, one-to-one, or small group sup-<lb/>port provision, has demonstrated the most successful out-<lb/>comes (<ref type="biblio">Arnold and Ipsen, 2005; Enabled4Enterprise, 2009a,<lb/> b; EMDA, 2009; Dotson et al., 2013</ref>). Tailored approaches<lb/> need to assess individuals&apos; business potential, ensure the<lb/> feasibility of the business idea, address skill and knowledge<lb/> deficiencies with business education, training and technical<lb/> support, support the development of a realistic business plan<lb/> and support adjustments as the business is realised (<ref type="biblio">Arnold<lb/> and Ipsen, 2005</ref>). While effective, such tailored approaches<lb/> are highly resource intensive and can therefore be difficult<lb/> to launch. An effective approach to overcome this challenge<lb/> is for policymakers to work with specialised organisations<lb/> who are already active in supporting people with disabilities.<lb/> In addition to leveraging external knowledge and support,<lb/> this will improve outreach to the target clients and allows<lb/> policymakers to benefit from the credibility and experience<lb/> of existing organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3 Ready to Start, United Kingdom<lb/></head>

			<figure>Target group: Ready to Start supported people with any form of disability.<lb/> Intervention type: It supported business start-up with skills training and individual business advisory services, matched<lb/> with direct financial support.<lb/> Description: The project operated between 2006 and 2009 and aimed to support 600 participants start businesses. A team<lb/> of regional coordinators recruited clients</figure>

			<p>and developed relationships with partner organisations to gain their support and to<lb/> seek client referrals. Partner organisations provided mentoring and training, as well as one-to-one advice on non-business<lb/> matters including benefits, housing and self-management. Regional coordinators oversaw the support delivery to ensure that<lb/> clients received the full range of support services needed and organised face-to-face and virtual networking events. After<lb/> the project started, direct financial support was added in the form of a small development fund. It aimed to help participants<lb/> purchase equipment, insurance and marketing materials, computer refurbishment and assistive technologies and membership<lb/> of the Federation of Small Businesses or similar trade bodies to provide continuing support and networking opportunities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The project was organised and operated by the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity and much of the financial support was<lb/> provide by Barclays Bank. Additional funding and support was provided by the Prince&apos;s Trust and other partner organisa-<lb/>tions such as Action for Blind People and Business Link London were crucial in recruiting and referring clients. These two<lb/> organisations were responsible for recruiting 43 % of the clients. Other partner organisations were important partners for<lb/> delivering training and advisory services, including Destiny, Northern Pintetree Trust and Meganexus.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results achieved:</head>

			<p>The project recruited 1 382 potential entrepreneurs with disabilities and of these, 735 established new<lb/> businesses. Participant surveys indicate that 82 % of clients found the support to be useful, 75 % said they were satisfied with<lb/> programme management and delivery and 93 % stated they wanted it to continue. Participants reported that the develop-<lb/>ment fund was the most useful element of the support, followed by the mentoring offer. Project evaluations estimate that<lb/> the project saved the UK Treasury GBP 3.5 million (approximately EUR 4.3 million) in benefit payments.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons for other initiatives:</head>

			<p>The project was successful because it provided intensive support that was tailored to<lb/> individual needs. However, this required a large amount of financial and human resources. The charity was able to lever-<lb/>age a combination of public and private sector funds and strategically partner with complementary organisations to recruit<lb/> participants and deliver the services. The project serves as a good example of how complementary, non-competitive rela-<lb/>tionships across a network of partners can successfully reach clients and deliver a service to a very narrow target base<lb/> across a wide geographic area.<lb/> For more information, please refer to: http://www.leonardcheshire.org/what-we-do/past-projects#.U6fzmRBLoyY<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Support</head>

			<p>the development,<lb/> acquisition and use of assistive<lb/> technologies<lb/> Goal<lb/></p>

			<p>Assistive technology can be life changing for people with dis-<lb/>abilities. They are becoming more sophisticated, increasingly<lb/> portable, less expensive and easier to use, and as result, hold<lb/> greater potential for improving the inclusion of people with<lb/> disabilities in economic activities and in entrepreneurship<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Angelocci et al., 2008</ref>). Policymakers can play a significant role<lb/> in supporting the development of these technologies to ensure<lb/> continual improvement and support people with disabilities in<lb/> acquiring and using these technologies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>Existing European policy currently supports the development<lb/> of assistive technologies for a wide range of applications<lb/> such as, ambient living, accessible transport and accessible<lb/> computer-interaction. To further support technological devel-<lb/>opment in these areas, governments can take two actions.<lb/> First they can continue to support research in these areas<lb/> through research grants and R &amp; D incentives. In particu-<lb/>lar, more incentives could be provided to develop assistive<lb/> technologies that relate to business software and business<lb/> organisational tools.<lb/> Second, actions can be taken to improve standardisation<lb/> in the assistive technology market. Common standards<lb/> are needed to reduce complexity and incompatibility of<lb/> accessible technologies. The implementation of obligatory<lb/> standards has had a positive impact in the United States<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Stack et al., 2009</ref>) and as noted earlier, there is much<lb/> room for improvement in this regard in the EU. To address<lb/> this, the European Commission is supporting a number of<lb/> projects such as Cloud4all (see Box 4), which promotes the<lb/> development of assistive technologies related to informa-<lb/>tion technologies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4 Cloud4all<lb/></head>

			<p>Intervention type: Cloud4all is a project that aims to advance the development of assistive technologies to allow people<lb/> with disabilities to better use information technologies such as computers and the Internet.<lb/></p>

			<p>Objectives: People with disabilities often require assistive technologies to interact with computers and other information<lb/> technologies. One of the challenges faced by people with disabilities is that each time they use a new piece of equipment or<lb/> technology, the assistive technology must be downloaded, installed and configured prior to use. This can be a major barrier<lb/> for disabled people, for example when interacting with a public computer. Cloud4all provides solutions to store assistive<lb/> technologies and user profiles in a cloud for location-independent access (Cloud4all, 2013a).<lb/> Description: Cloud4all is an international project funded by the seventh framework programme (FP7) of the European Union<lb/> that advances the concept of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) by improving the ability for assistive technolo-<lb/>gies to work across platforms, technologies and applications (<ref type="biblio">Cloud4all, 2013</ref>). The GPII is a project of &apos;Raising the Floor&apos;, a<lb/> consortium of academic, industry and non-governmental organisations and individuals. The initiative applies a consortium as<lb/> legal form, composed of 27 members representing various types of public and private organisations from different European<lb/> countries. The project coordinator is Fundosa Technosite S.A. in Spain and it has the following objectives (<ref type="biblio">Cloud4all, 2013</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p>• Simple, instant accessibility for all;<lb/> • Access anywhere, from any device;<lb/></p>

			<p>• Better connect supply and demand; and<lb/> • Provide an affordable method that offers the diversity of needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Total costs of the project amount to approximately EUR 13.1 million, of which EUR 7.6 million are received from the European<lb/> Commission (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Results</head>

			<p>expected: Cloud4all will allow the development of usable and accessible interfaces for people that face challenges<lb/> using information technology products due to disability, literacy or age-related barriers. The development of Cloud4all will<lb/> also have significant impacts for suppliers of assistive technologies and accessible information and communication tech-<lb/>nologies by providing an accessible platform for their products and services (Cloud4all, 2013a).<lb/> In addition to supporting the development of these technolo-<lb/>gies, policymakers can also support the acquisition and use<lb/> of assistive technologies by entrepreneurs with disabilities.<lb/> This is often done by providing direct financial support, such<lb/> as a grant, that assists in the acquisition of special equip-<lb/>ment and technologies needed when starting a business. One<lb/> example of this approach can be found in Greece where the<lb/> European Social Fund supports a self-employment scheme<lb/> for the vulnerable unemployed, which provides grants to cover<lb/> business start-up costs for unemployed people from vulner-<lb/>able groups. Unemployed people with disabilities are also<lb/> eligible to receive additional grants to cover up to 90 % of<lb/> the cost of adapting their workplace to their disability. For<lb/> more information on this scheme, please refer to OECD/The<lb/> European Commission (2013).<lb/> This approach is also used in Austria. Labour market policy<lb/> related to disability in Austria focuses on vocational training<lb/> and job placement initiative. As part of these employment ini-<lb/>tiatives, the grants are provided by the Federal Social Welfare<lb/> Office to support people with disabilities in obtaining employ-<lb/>ment or entering self-employment (as well as offering incen-<lb/>tives to businesses to hire people with disabilities). The support<lb/> for self-employment includes an ongoing subsidy to address<lb/> disability-related performance constraints. This subsidy covers<lb/> the purchase of machinery, equipment or technologies that<lb/> address workplace (i.e. mobility-related), technical and ergo-<lb/>nomic challenges. It covers a minimum of half of the costs and<lb/> can be accessed on an ongoing basis.<lb/> Policy can also support training so that people with disabilities<lb/> know how to properly use assistive technologies and informa-<lb/>tion and communication technologies so that they can maxim-<lb/>ise participation in society and the labour market. One approach<lb/> is computer training offered by the Latvian Society for the<lb/> Blind (see Box 5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5 Latvian Society for the Blind<lb/></head>

			<p>Target group: The Latvian Society for the Blind provides training and rehabilitation support for those who are fully or<lb/> partially visually impaired.<lb/></p>

			<head>Intervention type: This organisation provides vocational and computer training.<lb/></head>

			<p>Objectives: The goals of the society are (i) to cooperate with the Latvian parliament, government, local institutions and<lb/> non-governmental organisations to promote issues and concerns for visually impaired people; (ii) to raise awareness among<lb/> the general public about the causes and consequences of blindness, promoting methods of overcoming challenges to<lb/> achieve success in education, professional career, social and private life; (iii) to provide occupational training, rehabilitation<lb/> and integration into the labour market; and (iv) to provide assistance in obtaining assistive devices such as white canes,<lb/> magnifiers, talking watches, and other technologies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Description: The Latvian Society for the Blind Rehabilitation Centre was established in 1993 and works in co-operation<lb/> with the Latvian state employment office to provide rehabilitation services for people with visual impairments. The services<lb/> include mobility training, Braille reading and writing, housekeeping, cooking and more. These are provided in two programmes<lb/> of either 50 or 400 hours, depending on the needs of the individual. This support includes occupational training to help<lb/> participants learn skills that can be used in employment to help them start their own business. There are currently two types<lb/> of training provided, wickerwork and massage. Starting in 1998, the Rehabilitation Centre started providing computer train-<lb/>ing. There are 10 places per course, of which four are reserved for people that are fully blind. The course helps participants<lb/> learn how to use synthesised speech tools, screen magnifiers and other technologies that allow them to use computers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Results achieved: To date, 61 visually impaired people have received training in wickerwork and 75 % work as self-employed<lb/> craftspeople. An additional 61 people were trained in massage and nearly all continue to work in this field.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4. Ensure access to appropriate<lb/> financial support<lb/> Goal<lb/></head>

			<p>Access to finance for business start-up is often cited as one<lb/> of the greatest barriers to business start-up and this chal-<lb/>lenge can be even greater for entrepreneurs with disabilities.<lb/> Many potential entrepreneurs with disabilities have little work<lb/> experience and as a result often have low levels of savings<lb/> and collateral. It can also be more difficult for them to obtain<lb/> external financing because they can have difficulty accessing<lb/> information on financing and sources of investment. At the<lb/> same time, they may have a greater need for external financing<lb/> because they may have higher costs during business start-up<lb/> due to a need to purchase technology or equipment related to<lb/> their disability or a need to hire additional help to do tasks that<lb/> many entrepreneurs can do themselves. Public policy should<lb/> aim to ensure that entrepreneurs with disabilities can access<lb/> financing for business creation. In most instances there will not<lb/> be a sufficient base of potential entrepreneurs with disabilities<lb/> to warrant the creation of a specialised micro-finance scheme<lb/> for entrepreneurs with disabilities. Instead, policymakers should<lb/> aim to open up access to mainstream financing schemes to<lb/> entrepreneurs with disabilities. In addition, policymakers should<lb/> also ensure that funding is available to help people with dis-<lb/>abilities acquire and learn to use specialised equipment that<lb/> will facilitate business creation and management.<lb/></p>

			<head>Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>A good place for policymakers to start when looking to improve<lb/> access to finance for potential entrepreneurs with disabilities<lb/> is to ensure that existing financial supports are accessible and<lb/> available to people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that<lb/> information on sources of financing is available in accessible<lb/> formats and the financing programmes do not discriminate<lb/> based on disability.<lb/> Second, policymakers can help bridge the gap between potential<lb/> entrepreneurs and investors by helping disabled entrepreneurs<lb/> become investment-ready and by facilitating access to inves-<lb/>tors with networking events, &apos;pitching events&apos; and business<lb/> competitions. The aim is to help entrepreneurs understand<lb/> how the financial industry operates and the requirements<lb/> for receiving investment. Policymakers can go even further<lb/> by bringing investors and entrepreneurs together in special<lb/> events. Face-to-face contact is important to build networks<lb/> and relationships, and entrepreneurs can use the opportunity<lb/> to &apos;sell&apos; their entrepreneurial project. An example of such an<lb/> approach is &apos;Enabled4Growth&apos; which was a small project in<lb/> London, United Kingdom, that aimed to support disabled entre-<lb/>preneurs in accessing finance to expand their business. While it<lb/> did not directly provide funding for the participants, it provided<lb/> training entrepreneurs on how to be investment-ready, to help<lb/> with funding applications and to host networking events where<lb/> entrepreneurs could meet investors.<lb/></p>

			<p>A third approach is to increase the availability of direct financ-<lb/>ing, either as small grants or repayable loans. There are a very<lb/> small number of policy schemes in the EU that provide targeted<lb/> financial support for entrepreneurs with disabilities but a lesson<lb/> to bear in mind when designing targeted financial support is<lb/> that financial support for business start-up is more effective<lb/> when delivered in parallel with skills training. An example of<lb/> this approach is &apos;Looking for another sense for entrepreneur-<lb/>ship&apos; in the Slovak Republic, which provides training and funding<lb/> through a business plan competition. See Box 6 for more details.<lb/> Financial support might also extend to the issue of benefits. In<lb/> particular, policymakers should ensure that those moving from<lb/> labour market inactivity, and a high reliance on various forms of<lb/> disability-related benefit, are not disadvantaged or discouraged<lb/> by a benefit system that either responds too quickly to cut ben-<lb/>efits before the transition to entrepreneurship has generated<lb/> any economic gain or by one that adapts too slowly where the<lb/> attempt at entrepreneurship proves unsuccessful. The benefit<lb/> system should be flexible enough to encourage individuals to<lb/> create new firms but also to support those unable to make<lb/> them work. This flexibility should be communicated effectively<lb/> to those at whom the system is targeted, so unjustified fears<lb/> are mitigated, reducing a key barrier to business start-up.<lb/></p>

			<p>Box 6 Looking for another sense (&apos;Hľadáme ďalší zmysel – PRE PODNIKANIE&apos;), Slovak Republic<lb/></p>

			<figure>Target group: &apos;Looking for another sense&apos; is a project for deaf entrepreneurs aged 18 to 55.<lb/> Intervention type: The project provides information, business consultancy and direct financial support.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Objectives: The project aims to help provide training and labour market support for deaf people in the Slovak Republic<lb/> because education opportunities and labour market support is limited to a small number of schools that offer specific train-<lb/>ing for a limited number of careers such as hairdressing, tailoring, carpentry or goldsmithing. Many skilled deaf people are<lb/> long-term unemployed and have difficulty accessing labour market information and appropriate training.<lb/></p>

			<p>Description: The project is organised and implemented by the Endowment Fund Telekom at the Pontis Foundation, which<lb/> is largely funded by private donors but it also receives some government support. It offers self-employment training and<lb/> access to established entrepreneurs through an online forum, as well as other services such as sign language translators<lb/> and training. In 2012, EUR 50 000 was allocated to support deaf entrepreneurs on the programme.<lb/> Every year, 20 deaf people who are interested in self-employment are selected by an independent committee for a free<lb/> week-long course on business start-up. The course consists of 45 teaching hours that include short lectures, discussions and<lb/> case studies of successful entrepreneurs. During this training, participants learn about basic business finance, marketing and<lb/> regulation. The course is offered for free; participants only pay for travel expenses incurred to reach the training session.<lb/> Following the course, participants are eligible to receive additional mentoring support at no cost. This includes support in the<lb/> development of a business plan and business advisory services during the first 12 months of business operation. Participants<lb/> are eligible to receive a grant of up to EUR 3 320 to support their business start-up by applying to an independent committee<lb/> and successfully defending their business plan. The project also provides networking opportunities for participants to meet<lb/> and develop partnerships with other entrepreneurs. Finally, the project also offers free advertising space on an online portal.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results achieved:</head>

			<p>Since the project started in 2008, more than 48 deaf entrepreneurs have successfully started their own<lb/> businesses, creating jobs for an 50 additional people with hearing impairments. Approximately half of these businesses<lb/> continue to operate. One of the most successful supported start-ups is Deaf Kebab, a kebab restaurant where customers<lb/> order using sign language. Deaf Kebab currently has four franchises and employees more than 10 employees with hearing<lb/> impairments. Other supported businesses operate in a wide variety of sectors, including parachute repairs. The online web<lb/> portal has also expanded to become a broader online business support resource for deaf entrepreneurs and now includes<lb/> pertinent business information and a business advisory forum.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons for other initiatives: The success</head>

			<p>of the project is due to an integrated support package that provides entrepre-<lb/>neurship training before start-up and builds on this initial skill-set after business start-up through targeted business advisory<lb/> services and networking support. In addition, a competitive mechanism is used to award financial support which acts as an<lb/> incentive for participants and awards funding where it is most likely to be used successfully. Another feature that comple-<lb/>ments the support for the entrepreneur is the support that the online portal provides in reaching the market. This support<lb/> is intensive and costly. One of the ongoing challenges that the project faces is the need to find financial donors to ensure<lb/> that the support is provided free-of-charge to clients.<lb/> For more information, please refer to: http://www.nepocujucipodnikatelia.sk/grantovy-program/o-programe<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Continue to improve Internet<lb/> and IT accessibility<lb/> Goal<lb/></head>

			<p>The Internet and mobile communication technologies have<lb/> become an integral part of society as they are now primary<lb/> methods of communication and accessing information. However<lb/> the benefits are not shared by all because many people with<lb/> disabilities have difficulty using many of these new technolo-<lb/>gies because they are often developed on different platforms<lb/> that are incompatible with assistive technologies. Policymakers<lb/> can do more to support the development and implementation<lb/> of accessibility standards that would improve access to these<lb/> technologies for people with disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>The EU has made a commitment towards improving Internet<lb/> and IT accessibility by signing the Convention on the Rights<lb/> of Persons with Disabilities (<ref type="biblio">United Nations, 2008</ref>). In addi-<lb/>tion, many EU countries passed laws and policies regarding<lb/> the accessibility of websites and software applications for the<lb/> public and private sector (W3C, 2006). However, evidence sug-<lb/>gests that there is still a long way to go towards achieving the<lb/> stated objectives in this regard.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first area of action for policymakers is to improve the<lb/> IT-accessibility of public websites. The European Union supports<lb/> Member States in these improving the accessibility of their web-<lb/>sites with projects such as the Digital Agenda for Europe, which<lb/> aims to achieve full accessibility of public sector websites by<lb/> 2015 (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2013</ref>). This is critical for people<lb/> with disabilities who are considering self-employment because<lb/> many public services are now online. For example, information on<lb/> business start-up and self-employment is disseminated through<lb/> websites along with links to other supports. Moreover, improving<lb/> the accessibility of public websites will help people with dis-<lb/>abilities comply with obligations such as business registration<lb/> and filing taxes. Improving the accessibility of public websites is<lb/> also a necessary step for governments to take before considering<lb/> measures to improve accessibility for the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important area for action is to harmonise the standards<lb/> and obligations in IT-accessibility across the EU. The Internet<lb/> holds great potential for entrepreneurs with disabilities because<lb/> it can help them overcome challenges related to communica-<lb/>tion and mobility. However, the vast majority of websites are<lb/> not in accessible formats and are not compatible with assistive<lb/> technologies. To make a significant impact in this area, large<lb/> international efforts are required. There are a small number of<lb/> projects such as Veritas (see Box 7) that attempt to bring public<lb/> and private stakeholders together to address these issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>Box 7 Virtual and augmented environments and realistic user interactions to achieve embedded<lb/> accessibility designs (Veritas), Germany<lb/> One of the significant challenges in the development of accessible technologies is the uncertainty of needs and requirements<lb/> by the end-users. In many cases major modifications occur after the product is developed, which adds a significant cost to<lb/> the process. The goal of Veritas project, which ran between 2010 to 2013, was to reduce the need for major modifications<lb/> after product development by identifying and comprehending user requirements more accurately and increasing the use of<lb/> standard technology platforms (<ref type="biblio">Veritas, 2013</ref>).<lb/> The initiative was a consortium, composed of 31 organisations from across the EU. The project is coordinated by Fraunhofer<lb/> Corporation in Germany. The total costs of this project were approximately EUR 11.7 million and it received EUR 8.0 million<lb/> from the European Commission&apos;s Community Research and Development Information Service (European Commission, 2013b).<lb/> Veritas bridged the gap between clients and technology producers by increasing access to information on the development<lb/> of information and communication technologies (ICT) and non-ICT products, concerning application areas such as: home,<lb/> workplace and entertainment. In addition, it aimed to better understand the requirements of these applications needed by<lb/> people with disabilities and ensure that developers and producers have this information (<ref type="biblio">Dangelmaier, 2010</ref>). For example,<lb/> the project developed several pilot applications that allow designers to better address the needs of various disabilities in<lb/> their products, including applications for automotive and motorcycle design, virtual simulators for home and office spaces<lb/> and simulators for healthcare products. In addition, Veritas advanced work in the entertainment field by developing multi-<lb/>modal interfacing tools that enable the conversion of the game content into information that is easily perceivable by users<lb/> with disabilities. Moreover, virtual reality technology was developed for games with therapeutic value for older people (i.e.<lb/> exercising cognitive and motor abilities) (<ref type="biblio">Dangelmaier, 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The project also aimed to provide a common platform for these technologies so that fewer modifications are needed once<lb/> the technologies are developed. This can also significantly enhance the dissemination of assistive technologies and new<lb/> services across the EU. People with disabilities will benefit from larger supplies of assistive technologies and innovative<lb/> services regarding their self-employment activities (<ref type="biblio">Dangelmaier, 2010</ref>).<lb/> For more information, please refer to: http://veritas-project.eu/about-2<lb/> CONCLUSIONS<lb/></p>

			<p>Approximately 16 % of the working age population in the EU is<lb/> impacted by disability and this proportion is likely to increase as<lb/> the population ages. Therefore, the issue of social and economic<lb/> participation of people with disabilities will become increasingly<lb/> important policy issue over the next decade and entrepreneurship<lb/> can be part of the solution for some members of this population.<lb/> People with disabilities are disproportionately inactive in the<lb/> labour market in all Member States (Applica/CESEP/European<lb/> Centre, 2007), but there is evidence to suggest that people<lb/> with disabilities that participate in the labour market are just<lb/> as likely as those without disabilities to be self-employed. Self-<lb/>employment can facilitate active social and economic participa-<lb/>tion and give control to the individual over their participation.<lb/> Entrepreneurship can allow flexibility in workload, work hours and<lb/> work location, providing more flexibility in coping with disability<lb/> than can be often found in paid employment.<lb/></p>

			<p>While business creation and self-employment are not suitable<lb/> for all people with disabilities, there are several ways in which<lb/> policymakers can improve their support for entrepreneurship<lb/> for people with disabilities. A first approach is to review current<lb/> business start-up support offerings to ensure that it is available<lb/> in accessible formats and to educate business advisors on the<lb/> potential and risks that business start-up and self-employment<lb/> have for people with disabilities. It is a realistic career option<lb/> for many and they should not be discouraged based on dis-<lb/>ability alone. An important element of improving information<lb/> on business start-up for people with disabilities is to increase<lb/> the amount of information available on the impact of business<lb/> creation and self-employment income on benefit payments<lb/> received by individuals. Many people with disabilities receive<lb/> different forms of public support including disability insurance<lb/> payments, housing allowances, minimum income supports,<lb/> etc. and it is important for their decision to start a business.<lb/></p>

			<p>A second area of action for governments is to support the devel-<lb/>opment and adoption of assistive technologies. Development of<lb/> these technologies is vitally important for much of this popu-<lb/>lation to more fully participate in daily life. Policymakers can<lb/> support these development efforts directly with funding and<lb/> tax incentives and offer financial incentives and support for<lb/> individuals to encourage the adoption of these technologies.<lb/> International cooperation is important in this field and gov-<lb/>ernments should seek partnerships with other governments,<lb/> international organisations and the business sector to ensure<lb/> common standards and platforms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, there is a limited evidence base that supports the<lb/> development of targeted training and support that is tai-<lb/>lored to the needs and challenges of entrepreneurs and<lb/> potential entrepreneurs with various disabilities. There are<lb/> three important considerations for this policy approach. First,<lb/> the size of the potential client group is nearly always very<lb/> small given the heterogeneity of impairment characteristics<lb/> (e.g. type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset).<lb/> Consequently, policy may need to support entrepreneurs with<lb/> diverse impairment characteristics in different ways and over<lb/> varying timescales. Intensive, tailored, one-to-one, or small<lb/> group support provision, likely produces the most success-<lb/>ful outcomes (<ref type="biblio">Arnold and Ipsen, 2005; Enabled4Enterprise,<lb/> 2009a, b; EMDA, 2009; Dotson et al., 2013</ref>) but such tailored<lb/> approaches are highly resource intensive. Partnerships with<lb/> specialist organisations are often essential to the success<lb/> of targeted approaches because they already have credible<lb/> relationships with the target clients and policymakers can<lb/> leverage existing resources to make tailored approaches<lb/> more cost-effective.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, governments should be doing more to ensure that all<lb/> public websites are accessible. With the Internet becoming<lb/> the primary way in which governments and citizens interact,<lb/> much more can be done to improve the accessibility of online<lb/> business services such as business registration, tax filing and<lb/> business information resources.</p>
