	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ<lb/> Income inequality in the European Union<lb/> Poor growth performance over the past decades in Europe has increased concerns for rising income<lb/> dispersion and social exclusion. European authorities have recently launched the Europe 2020 strategy<lb/> which aims to improve social inclusion in Europe on top of already existing European regional policies<lb/> aiming to reduce regional disparities through stimulating growth in areas where incomes are relatively low.<lb/> While it is most common to confine measures of inequality to national borders, the existence of such<lb/> union-wide objectives and policies motivates measuring income dispersion among all Europeans in this<lb/> paper. Towards the end of the 2000s the income distribution in Europe was more unequal than in the<lb/> average OECD country, albeit notably less so than in the United States. It is the within-country, not the<lb/> between-country dimension, which appears to be most important. Inequality in Europe has risen quite<lb/> substantially since the mid 1980s. While the EU enlargement process has contributed to this, it is not the<lb/> only explanation since inequality has also increased within a &quot; core &quot; of 8 European countries. Large income<lb/> gains among the 10% top earners appear to be a main driver behind this evolution.<lb/></div>
