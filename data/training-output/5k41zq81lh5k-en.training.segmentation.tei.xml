			<front>ABSTRACT/RESUMÉ <lb/>Transitions in and out of unemployment among young people in the Irish recession <lb/>Young people have been hit hard by unemployment during the Irish recession. While much research <lb/>has been undertaken to study the effects of the recession on overall labour market dynamics, little is known <lb/>about the specific effects on youth unemployment and the associated challenges. This paper attempts to fill <lb/>this gap by comparing the profile of transitions to work before the recession (2006) and as the economy <lb/>emerged from the recession (2011). The results indicate that the rate of transition of the youth from <lb/>unemployment to employment fell dramatically. The fall is not due to changes in the composition or the <lb/>characteristics of the unemployed group but to changes in the external environment, which implied that the <lb/>impact of certain individual characteristics changed over the course of the recession. In particular, for <lb/>youth, education and nationality have become more important for finding a job in Ireland. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2013 OECD Economic Survey of Ireland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/ireland) <lb/>JEL classification: J64, J61, J21, E24 <lb/>Keywords: youth unemployment; transitions; decomposition techniques; longitudinal data; Great recession; Ireland <lb/>************ <lb/>Les transitions de périodes de chômage et emploi parmi les jeunes dans la récession irlandaise <lb/>Les jeunes ont été durement frappés par le chômage pendant la récession irlandaise. Beaucoup de <lb/>recherches ont été menées pour étudier les effets de la récession sur la dynamique globale du marché du <lb/>travail, mais on sait peu de ses effets spécifiques sur le chômage des jeunes et les défis associés. Cet article <lb/>tente de combler cette lacune en comparant le profil des transitions vers le travail avant la récession (2006) <lb/>et au moment où l&apos;économie a émergé de la récession (2011). Les résultats indiquent que le taux de <lb/>transition des jeunes du chômage à l&apos;emploi a diminué de façon spectaculaire. La chute n&apos;est pas due à des <lb/>changements dans la composition ou les caractéristiques du groupe des chômeurs, mais à des changements <lb/>dans l&apos;environnement externe, ce qui implique que l&apos;impact de certaines caractéristiques individuelles a <lb/>changé au cours de la récession.

			<body>TRANSITIONS IN AND OUT OF <lb/>UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE IRISH RECESSION <lb/>By Elish Kelly, Seamus McGuinness, Philip O&apos;Connell, David Haugh and Alberto González Pandiella <lb/>1 <lb/>I. Introduction <lb/>The severity of the Great Recession on young people&apos;s labour market status has been well <lb/>documented, particularly in the most affected countries. Ireland was severely hit, as illustrated by the <lb/>contraction of Gross National Product (GNP) by almost 10% in 2009 (Duffy et al., 2011). The economy <lb/>temporarily resumed modest growth in 2010, before experiencing another contraction in 2011 <lb/>(Duffy et al., 2013). This collapse in economic activity resulted in the country&apos;s unemployment rate <lb/>increasing from 4.4% in 2006 to 14.7% in 2012 (Central Statistics Office, 2012a and 2013a), while the <lb/>youth unemployment rate increased from 8.7% in 2006 to 30.6 % in 2012 (Eurostat, 2013) <lb/>2 . Two <lb/>developments raise particular concerns in relation to young unemployed people: the growth in the numbers <lb/>with no formal education, which rose from 17.4% of unemployed people aged 15-24 in 2007 to 48.9% in <lb/>2011 (Eurostat, 2012) <lb/>3 ; and the percentage who are in long-term unemployment, which increased from <lb/>20.3% in 2007 to 45.8% in 2011 (OECD, 2013) 4 . Another worry is the rise in young people not in <lb/>employment, education or training (NEET), which has grown from 11.8 % in 2006 to 24% in 2011 <lb/>(Eurostat, 2013) 5 . <lb/>While policy-makers are aware of the unemployment rate of young people, little is known about this <lb/>group&apos;s profile or the extent to which it has changed since the beginning of the recession.

			<body>knowledge also exist in relation to their labour market transitions (i.e. movement from unemployment to <lb/>employment or inactivity, or remaining unemployed), both pre and post the great recession. Given this, and <lb/>particularly its importance in the design of effective activation measures to assist young unemployed <lb/>people, this paper addresses the following questions: <lb/>1. Has the profile of unemployed youths changed during the course of the recession? <lb/>2. What are the labour market transition patterns of young unemployed individuals&apos; pre and post the <lb/>boom? <lb/>3. To what extent do changes in the composition of the youth unemployment stock explain changes <lb/>in youth labour market transition rates over time? <lb/>4. To what extent do changes in the labour market value of various characteristics explain changes <lb/>in youth labour market transition rates over time? <lb/>The paper uses newly available longitudinal data from the Quarterly National Household Survey <lb/>(QNHS), Ireland&apos;s Labour Force Survey, to address these questions. The remainder of the paper is <lb/>structured as follows. Section II presents a brief overview of the Irish labour market. The literature on <lb/>young unemployed individuals is discussed in Section III, while the data and methodologies that are <lb/>employed in the paper are described in Section IV. Finally, the results from the analyses and the central <lb/>conclusions are presented in Sections V and VI. <lb/>II. The Labour Market for Young People in Ireland <lb/>The Great Recession led to a dramatic deterioration in the labour market. Total employment fell by <lb/>250 000 between the peak of Quarter 3 (Q3) 2007 and the end of 2009, a contraction of 11.5%. <lb/>Employment continued to fall, by another 100 000 from the end of 2009 to the beginning of 2012, <lb/>representing a cumulative decline in employment of 16% from the peak of the boom <lb/>(Central Statistics Office, 2013b). Subsequent employment growth has been extremely sluggish: total <lb/>employment increased by about 20 000, or 1.4% over the 12 months to the start of 2013. Unemployment <lb/>more than trebled, from 107 500 in Q3 2007 to over 328 000 in Q3 2012, and the unemployment rate <lb/>increased from 4.6% to more than 15% over that period. Since then, the unemployment rate has declined <lb/>somewhat, to 13.7% at the beginning of 2013, partly reflecting increasing part-time working, falling <lb/>participation and increased emigration. <lb/>The deterioration in the labour market for young people has been particularly severe. Total <lb/>employment among those aged less than 25 years collapsed in the recession, falling by over 50%, from <lb/>357 000 in Q3 2007 to 172 000 in Q3 2011. Following the well-documented burst of the Irish property <lb/>bubble, employment losses were concentrated in the construction and related sectors, but there were <lb/>notable declines across the whole private sector. Young people did not participate even in the modest <lb/>growth in overall employment in the most recent period, with the result that at the beginning of 2013 total <lb/>employment among those aged less than 25 years had fallen to 148 000, representing a cumulative decline <lb/>in employment of almost 60% since the peak of the boom. Given this contraction in young people&apos;s <lb/>employment, the employment rate shrank from just under 45% in 2007 to 27% in 2013 (Table 1). The <lb/>unemployment rate increased from 9% of the youth labour force in 2007 to almost 30% in Q3 2011, and <lb/>then, driven by a fall in participation, fell back to 26% in Q1 2013. It should be noted that notwithstanding <lb/>these high rates of unemployment, youth unemployment generally accounts for a relatively modest share <lb/>of total unemployment: in 2013, youth unemployment accounted for 18% of total unemployment. <lb/></body>

However, care should be taken in interpreting unemployment among <lb/>young people, given that young people may choose to remain in education rather than entering the labour <lb/>market when it is in recession. The importance of this in the Irish case can be seen by focusing on the <lb/>labour force participation rate, which has fallen steadily, from a high of 59% in 2007 to just 37% in 2013. <lb/>Conefrey (2011) examines the fall in participation among the younger age groups following the recession <lb/>in 2008 and finds that the majority of those who exited the labour force and remain in Ireland have <lb/>returned to education. Participation has also been affected by increasing outward migration, which has <lb/>been concentrated among the youngest cohorts (Conefrey, 2013). An alternative, and perhaps more <lb/>appropriate, measure of unemployment among young people is the unemployment ratio, which expresses <lb/>unemployment as a ratio of the total population cohort, rather than the number in the labour force, as is <lb/>used in the unemployment rate. The unemployment ratio increased sharply from 5% in 2007 to almost 13% <lb/>in 2011, and subsequently fell to just under 10% of the age cohort in 2013. <lb/>Table 2.

Thus, for example, the unemployment rate among males aged 15-19 years is over <lb/>46%, but this relates to the 16% of this age group that participates in the labour market, with the result that <lb/>the unemployment ratio for males aged 15-19 is just over 7% of the age group. Females have higher <lb/>employment rates and lower unemployment rates and ratios than males in the corresponding age groups <lb/>6 . <lb/>6. <lb/>In this more detailed discussion of the youth labour market we mainly focus on data relating to Q2 2011, the <lb/>start point for the panel data relating to the recession that is used in the analysis that follows. <lb/></body>

			<body>Just over 29 000 individuals in the 15-24 year age group had been unemployed for 12 months or more <lb/>in Q2 2011. This represented 40% of the total unemployed in this age group, a substantially lower <lb/>incidence of long-term unemployment than observed among older age groups – for example almost 60% of <lb/>the unemployed aged 25-44 were long term unemployed, as were 65% of those aged 45 years or older. The <lb/>lower incidence of long-term among young people relative to those among older cohorts may be due to <lb/>higher rates of labour force withdrawal following a period of unemployment. Among young people, labour <lb/>force withdrawal can entail returns to education as well as emigration, which is known to be higher among <lb/>younger people (Central Statistics Office, 2012b). The share of long-term in total unemployment is <lb/>generally higher among males, and this is also true for males aged 15-24. <lb/>Table 3.

Literature Review <lb/>There is a consensus emerging in the nascent literature on the effect of recessions on labour market <lb/>dynamics, that the great 2008-2009 recession has had particularly strong effects. Most of the studies focus <lb/>on the overall population as opposed to youths per se. An examination of US data up to 2009 revealed that <lb/>the unemployment to employment transition rate fell proportionately more in the great recession than in <lb/>previous recessions (Aaronson et al., 2012). <lb/>The transition rate in the great recession appears to have been affected by the exceptional weakness of <lb/>aggregate demand as well as changing composition of the unemployed (Valletta and Kuang, 2012). <lb/>Bachman et al., (2012) utilised a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to isolate the differences in US labour <lb/>market transition rates during the great recession into a part that is attributable to changes in the <lb/>composition of the underlying population, and a part that is due to changes in the returns to population <lb/>characteristics. They found composition effects change over the course of the recession, initially <lb/>contributing positively to a higher transition to employment, but gradually fading and turning negative over <lb/>the course of the contraction. According to Bachman et al., (2012), this is because at the beginning of the <lb/>recession the unemployment stock contained many more well-qualified and experienced individuals who <lb/>had been recently fired and who got re-employed quickly. However, as the recession continued the share of <lb/>less capable unemployed increased, which had a negative impact on the overall transition to employment. <lb/>Compositional changes also accounted partly for the sharp rise in duration of unemployment that <lb/>accompanied the great recession. One such factor in the United States over the past three decades is a <lb/>decline in the share in the labour force of youth, who tend to have shorter unemployment durations as they <lb/>frequently move in an out of the labour force (Valletta and Kuang, 2012). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)76 <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>By contrast policy change appears to have played less of a role. Farber et al., (2013) concluded that <lb/>the decline in the transition from unemployment to employment in the recent US recession was not due to <lb/>an extension in unemployment benefits. Instead, the small and statistically significant reduction in the <lb/>unemployment exit rate over the recent recession occurred primarily through a reduction in exits from the <lb/>labour force, rather than to a decrease in exits to employment. <lb/>Education plays a strong role in labour market status and transitions over the business cycle, although <lb/>this effect can vary across countries and the phase of the cycle. Prior to the crisis, the employment rate of <lb/>low-educated youths was higher in Spain than in Germany, France, United Kingdom and Netherlands, and <lb/>the opposite was found for youths with intermediate and higher levels of education (Dolado et al., 2013). <lb/>The probabilities of being unemployed and discouraged (i.e. not searching for work) increased the most <lb/>during the crisis for poorly educated individuals in South Africa (Verick, 2012). It also appears that <lb/>education had more influence on labour-market outcomes as the recent recession progressed. Analysis of <lb/>data for the United Kingdom shows that the substantial differences in the employment, unemployment and <lb/>inactivity rates, and transition probabilities, across different education levels were exacerbated by the <lb/>recession, particularly for lower education levels (Gomes, 2012). <lb/>In addition to education, employment history also plays a role in transitions, which varies across <lb/>countries. A greater history of temporary jobs decreased the probability of studying in Spain, while the <lb/>opposite was found for the Netherlands (Dolado et al., 2013). For woman, in addition to human capital <lb/>factors, such as education and previous work experience, young children also influence (negatively) their <lb/>mothers&apos; transition probabilities from non-employment to employment (Russell and O&apos;Connell, 2004). <lb/>There is also evidence at the overall labour force level that immigration status has a bearing on overall <lb/>labour market dynamics, including during the great recession. Total employment losses among non-Irish <lb/>nationals were four times higher than for Irish nationals (McGinnity et al., 2011). Veenman (2011) <lb/>documents that in the Netherlands native Dutch individuals leave unemployment the fastest, and among the <lb/>non-native individuals Turks exit unemployment most slowly. In contrast to these findings, immigrant <lb/>status had no statistically significant effect on the probability of working in Spain (Dolado et al., 2013). In <lb/>spite of this research, little is known about the role of immigration status for youths and how it may have <lb/>changed pre-and post the recent economic crisis. <lb/>Regarding youth, it is well known that young people tend to be particularly hard hit by recessions. <lb/>Several papers have looked at the impact of economic downturns on youth&apos;s labour market status, but most <lb/>of the work focuses on the effects of recessions on their unemployment levels rather than on their labour <lb/>market transitions. A review of the effects on unemployment by age cohort of previous financial crises in <lb/>Finland, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Turkey found that youths are worst effected; and the <lb/>unemployment gap with respect to adults remains even after the economy has begun to recover <lb/>(Verick, 2011). Indeed, financial crises have protracted effects on youth unemployment and may affect <lb/>youths five years after the onset of the crisis (Choudry et al., 2012). <lb/>Previous research on labour market transitions among young people using German and United <lb/>Kingdom data prior to the great recession found that recent unemployment history and education played an <lb/>important role in youth transitions (Isengard, 2003). However, as for the general population, an analysis of <lb/>nine European countries found that the impact of education on employment probabilities for youth differed <lb/>significant across countries (Russell and O&apos;Connell, 2001). <lb/>For Irish youth, work experience enhances the possibility of finding a job (O&apos;Connell and <lb/>McGinnity, 1997). Kelly et al., (2012), using Irish data, find that a recent history of long-term <lb/>unemployment, advanced age, number of children, relatively low levels of education, and <lb/></body>

			<body>literacy/numeracy problems all reduced young unemployed individuals&apos; probability of moving into <lb/>employment. <lb/>How the great recession may have altered the importance of various characteristics in determining <lb/>youths&apos; labour market outcomes remains relatively unexplored. This paper attempts to, inter alia, partially <lb/>fill this gap in the literature by examining how labour market transitions for unemployed youth in Ireland, <lb/>one of the hardest hit economies in the OECD during the global financial crisis, have changed pre-crisis <lb/>(2006) and as the economy emerged from the recent recession (2011). <lb/>IV. Data and Methodology <lb/>Analysing the impact of the recession on the situation of youths in the labour market can be enhanced <lb/>by the availability of longitudinal data, as such data enables researchers to analyse the movements of <lb/>individuals in and out of unemployment, employment and inactivity. A good understanding of these <lb/>movements, so-called labour market transitions, can be helpful in designing effective labour market <lb/>policies to assist unemployed youths to reintegrate back into the labour market. Longitudinal data allows <lb/>researchers to assess associations between various characteristics, such as age or educational attainment, <lb/>and transitions between different labour market states. By following individuals over time, longitudinal <lb/>data analysis also enables researchers to assess how labour market transitions, or the associations with <lb/>different characteristics, may change pre and post an economic crisis. <lb/>The data used in this paper come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) longitudinal <lb/>data file. The longitudinal component of the QNHS is a relatively new dataset that has been made available <lb/>by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which is Ireland&apos;s national statistical collection organisation. The <lb/>main objective of the QNHS is to provide quarterly labour force estimates on employment, unemployment, <lb/>etc. The survey is continuous and targets all private households in the State. The total sample for each <lb/>quarter is approximately 39 000, which is achieved by interviewing about 3 000 households per week. <lb/>Households are asked to take part in the survey for five consecutive quarters. In each quarter, one-fifth of <lb/>the households surveyed are replaced and the QNHS sample involves an overlap of 80% between <lb/>consecutive quarters and 20% between the same quarters in consecutive years. While participation in the <lb/>QNHS is voluntary, the response rate is quite high (approximately 85% in recent years). <lb/>7 <lb/>The benefit of using the QNHS longitudinal data is that it enabled us to follow the labour market <lb/>transitions of individuals for up to 5 consecutive quarters. In terms of the periods covered in our study, we <lb/>focused on comparing the youth unemployment situation both pre and post recession. We selected <lb/>Quarter 2 (Q2) 2006 as the starting point for our pre-recession analysis, which was during the height of the <lb/>boom in Ireland; and Q2 2011 as our start point for the analysis relating to the Recession. For the purposes <lb/>of the paper, we selected two balanced panels. Specifically, we focus on young individuals (defined as <lb/>aged 15 to 24) who were unemployed on entering the panel and who remained in the panel for the next two <lb/>consecutive quarters: we were unable to take advantage of the full panel information (i.e. use the five <lb/>quarters of data) due to the small number of young people who remained both unemployed and present in <lb/>the data for five continuous quarters during the boom period (e.g. 2006). Thus, we are focusing on the <lb/>transition patterns of young unemployed people between Q2 and Q4 in 2006 and 2011 respectively, <lb/>focusing particularly on their transitions from unemployment into employment. Given this, our <lb/>unemployed youth sample is 5 926 for 2006 and 13 933 for 2011 <lb/>8 . In order to accommodate our empirical <lb/>7. <lb/>Information provided by the CSO. <lb/>8. <lb/>We excluded those who transitioned into economic inactivity from the analysis, and also those individuals that <lb/>did not provide information on their education. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)76 <lb/></body>

			<body>strategy, we transform our balanced panel into a cross-sectional dataset based on the characteristics of <lb/>individuals observed in Q2 2006 and Q2 2011 respectively and incorporate their transition behaviours in <lb/>Q3 and Q4 for each of the observed years. Given that we only consider individuals who remain present in <lb/>Ireland over the observation periods, those who migrated to or from Ireland during the period covered by <lb/>each panel are excluded from the analysis. <lb/>In this paper, we begin by assessing the impact of various socio-economic and demographic factors <lb/>on an unemployed youth&apos;s likelihood of transitioning to employment. This analysis is undertaken by <lb/>estimating separate binary probit models for 2006 and 2011, where the dependent variable equals one if an <lb/>unemployed youth transitioned to employment during the observation period and zero otherwise. The <lb/>characteristics investigated are as follows: gender, age, nationality, educational attainment, geographic <lb/>location and previous unemployment duration 9 . <lb/>In addition to examining the impact of various socio-economic characteristics on an unemployed <lb/>youth&apos;s likelihood of transitioning to employment, we are also interested in investigating what has driven <lb/>the change in the unemployment-to-employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011. This analysis was <lb/>undertaken using decomposition techniques. With this approach, we split out the change in the <lb/>unemployment to employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011 into the proportion due to i) changes <lb/>in the composition of the youth unemployed population (e.g. if there are more unemployed youths with <lb/>higher levels of schooling), which is known as the &apos;Endowment Effect&apos;; ii) changes in the labour market <lb/>returns to possessing certain characteristics over time (e.g. changes in the marginal impact of <lb/>characteristics on the probability of a transition to employment in 2011 relative to 2006), which is known <lb/>as the &apos;Coefficient Effect&apos;; and iii) an unexplained effect, which is due to unobserved factors that are not <lb/>observed in the QNHS longitudinal data. Given that our dependent variable is a dichotomous 0/1 variable, <lb/>we estimated non-linear decomposition models: i) the Fairlie model, which produces an overall <lb/>endowment effect, ii) the Non-linear decompose model <lb/>10 , which gives overall endowment and coefficient <lb/>effects, and iii) the Oaxaca decomposition, which produces overall endowment and coefficient effects and <lb/>also a breakdown for each individual variable. <lb/>V. Results <lb/>Descriptives <lb/>Table 4 presents the profile of youths who were unemployed in Q2 2006 and 2011 according to their <lb/>subsequent labour market status, i.e. remained continuously unemployed between Q2 2006 (2011) and Q4 <lb/>2006 (2011) or transitioned into employment. <lb/>Focussing first on the characteristics of those that remained continuously unemployed, there was a <lb/>considerable drop in the proportion of such youths aged 15 to 19 between 2006 and 2011, falling from 46% <lb/>to 19%, while the proportion aged 20 to 24 increased. The fall in the younger age category may be due to <lb/>such individuals choosing to remain outside of the labour market in 2011 as a result of the recession, <lb/>remaining on in education instead. The proportion of continuously unemployed that was male increased <lb/>slightly in 2011, while there was a fall in the proportion that was Irish. In relation to educational <lb/>attainment, there was a substantial drop in the proportion that had a Junior Certificate or less qualification <lb/>9. <lb/>The QNHS contains information on a person&apos;s previous economic sector of employment; however, we were <lb/>not able to include this variable in our specifications as a significant proportion of young people did not <lb/>provide this information, and for those that did, there was not enough variation in the data to estimate our <lb/>models. <lb/>10. <lb/>nldecompose command in Stata. <lb/></body>

			<body>In relation to the characteristics of those that transitioned from unemployment to employment, there <lb/>was a fall in the proportion that was male between 2006 and 2011. The proportion that was Irish increased <lb/>also. In terms of educational attainment, there was a fall in the proportion that had a Junior Certificate or <lb/>Leave Certificate qualification, while there was a considerable increase in the percentage with a <lb/>Third-level Degree or Higher qualification over the period. With respect to previous unemployment <lb/>duration, there was a sizeable increase by 2011 in the proportion of individuals who made the transition <lb/>from unemployment to employment who had already experienced 13 months or more unemployment <lb/>duration at the start of the panel, while the percentages making a successful employment transition that had <lb/>experienced 1 to 3 months or 7 to 12 months of previous unemployment fell. This suggests that successful <lb/>employment transitions were more evenly distributed across unemployment durations in the later period, <lb/>which suggests that the long-term unemployed during the boom period were distinctive and/or particularly <lb/>disadvantaged in terms of labour market prospects. Finally, some changes in the shares entering <lb/>employment by geographical region were also apparent between 2006 and 2011. <lb/>Table 5 shows the transition rates for unemployed youths in both 2006 and 2011. In 2006, 38% of <lb/>unemployed youths transitioned into employment; however, only 17% made this labour market transition <lb/>in 2011. As one might expect, the proportion of youths that remained continuously unemployed increased <lb/>between 2006 and 2011, from 37% to 52%, and there was an increase in the numbers entering into <lb/>economic inactivity. Overall labour force participation rates among those aged 15-24 declined from 55% in <lb/>2006 to 42% in 2011. While the change in the magnitude and nature of transitions to inactivity before and <lb/>during the recession is an important issue for policy, the issue is not addressed in the current study as it is <lb/>likely that the dynamics of change are likely to be quite distinct relative to unemployment and employment <lb/>transitions and, as such, warrant a dedicated analysis. <lb/>Table 5. Unemployed Youths Labour Market Transition Rates: 2006 and 2011 (% of total sample) <lb/>Continuously Unemployed <lb/>Into Employment <lb/>Into Inactivity <lb/>2006 <lb/>37.4 <lb/>38.0 <lb/>24.6 <lb/>2011 <lb/>51.6 <lb/>17.4 <lb/>31.0 <lb/>Econometrics <lb/>The results from our probit models on the determinants of transitioning from unemployment to <lb/>employment in 2006 and 2011 are presented in Table 6. During both the boom and recessionary periods in <lb/>Ireland, we can see that unemployed males were significantly less likely than females to enter employment. <lb/>Interestingly, while during the Celtic Tiger era unemployed youths aged 20 to 24 were more likely to find a <lb/>job compared to those aged 15 to 19, the opposite result was the case during the recession in 2011. We also <lb/>see that the nationality result has changed with Irish nationals more likely to enter employment in 2011 <lb/>relative to 2006. Apart from Third-level Non-Degree holders, all educational qualifications raised the <lb/>likelihood of transitioning into employment during 2006 compared to those with a Junior Certificate <lb/>qualification or less. The finding that the third-level non-degree holders had a lower probability of <lb/>transitioning to employment in 2006 relative to youths with compulsory education or less is potentially <lb/>explained by two factors: (a) a very high level of demand for unskilled workers due to high demand within <lb/>construction and service industries; and (b) a poor alignment with subject provision in this area with the <lb/>needs of the labour market at that time. The largest educational coefficient during the earlier time period <lb/>was associated with having a Post-Leaving Cert (PLC) level qualification, which predominately related to <lb/>either a vocational education or apprenticeship training in the retail, catering/hospitality and construction <lb/>sectors. However, in 2011 there is no statistical difference in the impact of a Junior Certificate or less <lb/>qualification and a PLC level qualification on transitioning from unemployment into employment, with <lb/>both educational categories having a lower impact on employment transitions compared to the other <lb/></body>

			<body>educational groups. With respect to relative marginal effects, the magnitude of the Leaving Certificate <lb/>coefficient has fallen over time; whereas there has been a large increase in the Third-level Degree or <lb/>Higher coefficient. Unlike the 2006 situation where the impact was negative, possessing a Third-level <lb/>Non-Degree qualification increases the probability of a successful labour-market transition relative to the <lb/>base education category, driven presumably by a rapid fall in the relative demand for unskilled labour <lb/>relative to the earlier period. Some changes are also observed in relation to geographic location. Finally, in <lb/>relation to previous unemployment duration, all categories above 1-3 months are significantly less likely to <lb/>move from unemployment to employment during both the boom and recession periods; the size of the <lb/>effects for 7-12 months has increased over time while it has fallen for the other duration categories. <lb/></body>

			<body>Moving on to our decomposition analysis, the overall decomposition results from the three non-linear <lb/>models that we estimated are shown in Table 7. Reassuringly, each of the decomposition models produced <lb/>almost identical results. The &apos;Overall Difference&apos; result tells us that the transition rate from unemployment <lb/>to employment fell by 25 percentage points between 2006 and 2011. Of this, changes in the structure of the <lb/>youth unemployed population (i.e. the endowment effect) between 2006 and 2011 can only explain <lb/>2.5 percentage points of the fall in the transition rate, while changes in the returns to possessing the <lb/>characteristics that we have included in our model (i.e. the coefficient effect) explains a bigger proportion <lb/>of the fall in the transition rate. However, unobservable factors that we have not included in our <lb/>specification (e.g. labour market experience, socio-economic background, etc.), because such information <lb/>is not available in the QNHS longitudinal data, account for almost half of the fall in the transition rate. <lb/>Table 7. Overall Decomposition Results (changes in transition rates) <lb/>Fairlie <lb/>Nldecompose <lb/>Oaxaca <lb/>Overall Difference <lb/>-24.6 <lb/>-24.9 <lb/>-24.9 <lb/>Endowment Effect <lb/>-2.5 <lb/>-2.5 <lb/>-2.5 <lb/>Coefficient Effect <lb/>-25.6 <lb/>-25.6 <lb/>Interaction <lb/>3.2 <lb/>3.2 <lb/>Table 8 gives a breakdown of the individual coefficient results; specifically, it lists what the main <lb/>drivers are in explaining the change in the transition rate between 2006 and 2011, which we were able to <lb/>account for in our models. On the one hand, we can see from this table that relative to possessing a Junior <lb/>Certificate qualification, having either a Leaving Certificate or PLC level qualification had a depreciating <lb/>effect on the unemployment-to-employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011. Having previous <lb/>unemployment duration of 7 to 12 months, relative to those with previous unemployment duration of 1 to <lb/>3 months, also had a depreciating effect on the transition rate. On the other hand, possessing a third-level <lb/>qualification (Non-Degree or Degree or Higher) had an appreciating effecting on the unemployment to <lb/>employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011, as did being Irish, aged 15 to 19 and having a previous <lb/>unemployment duration of 13 months and above <lb/>12 . Overall, our results indicate that the relative fall in the <lb/>unemployment to employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011 is not due to changes in the <lb/>population structure of unemployed young people, but to changes in external factors that have had an <lb/>impact on possessing certain characteristics. These are likely to reflect the impact of the recession. <lb/>12. <lb/>An important policy change took place over the period whereby the entitlement to contributions related <lb/>assistance (Jobseekers benefit (JB)) was reduced from 15 to 12 months. However, given that individuals in the <lb/>15 to 19 age bracket who became unemployed in 2006 were unlikely to have made sufficient contributions to <lb/>entitle them to JSB for an extended period, we do not believe that the policy switch will have a strong impact <lb/>in explaining the observed result. <lb/></body>

			<body>VI. Conclusions <lb/>Using a unique longitudinal dataset, this paper examined the extent to which transitions to <lb/>employment among unemployed youths in Ireland changed over the great recession. The study found that <lb/>the rate of transition to employment for unemployed youths fell dramatically between 2006 and 2011. <lb/>Overall, the results showed that the fall in unemployed youth&apos;s transition rate was not due to changes in <lb/>composition, or the characteristics of the unemployed group but to changes in the external environment <lb/>that meant that the impact of certain characteristics changed over the course of the recession. For example, <lb/>it was found that the there was a rise in the marginal impact of education and Irish nationality on the <lb/>probability of a successful transition from unemployment to employment. This finding is consistent with <lb/>an emerging international pattern in which the importance of education to labour market outcomes has <lb/>increased in the course of the recession. There was also a change in the impact of age, with younger <lb/>workers having now better prospects than young adults. Youth possessing higher educational levels face <lb/>better prospects of moving into employment, and certain qualifications (for example PLC level <lb/>qualification), which enhanced employability in 2006, did no longer have a positive effect in 2011. <lb/>Previous unemployment spells continued to have a detrimental impact on the likelihood of moving into <lb/>employment for all unemployment durations. Those unemployed for 7-12 months faced more difficulties <lb/>in accessing employment after the recession. Periods of unemployment shorter than 6 months and longer <lb/>than 13 months continued to have a negative impact, although the impact was found to be smaller in 2011 <lb/>than in 2006. However, caution should be used in interpreting the smaller negative impact on the length of <lb/>unemployment. In particular, labour market conditions remained difficult in 2011, with aggregate <lb/>employment continuing to fall. In these circumstances, it is difficult for anyone (short or long-term <lb/>unemployed) to find a job, likely masking scarring effects. As the economy picks up and more jobs are <lb/>created, the scarring effect may become more obvious as there will be vacancies for the newly unemployed <lb/>to apply to and out-compete the long-term unemployed. <lb/></body>
