<lb/> 
            <table>Country<lb/> Medical school intake<lb/> Australia<lb/> Medical school intake is controlled by the Commonwealth Government through the funding of university places. In<lb/> 1973, the Report of the Committee on Medical Schools to the Australian Universities Commission recommended an<lb/> increase in medical school intake, including the establishment of two new medical schools to provide 1,560<lb/> graduates per year by 1991. In 1988, the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education noted a surplus of GPs in<lb/> urban areas. Since 1996, the Commonwealth Government has imposed a cap on medical school places to assist in<lb/> controlling the supply of the medical workforce. The cap applies to domestic medical students only. The number of<lb/> undergraduate medical school entrants has increased in the late 1990s (from 856 in 1995 to 1,334 in 1999). In 2005,<lb/> the Federal Government requested the Productivity Commission to undertake an enquiry which would address inter<lb/> alia the relation between workforce needs and medical school places.<lb/> Austria<lb/> The Government does not restrict the number of students admitted to medical school.<lb/> Belgium<lb/> In 1997, the Belgian Government fixed the number of physicians who would have access to accreditation for practice<lb/> at 700 in 2004, 650 in 2005 and 600 in 2006. These numbers break down to 60% Flemish-speaking and 40%<lb/> French-speaking students.<lb/> Canada<lb/> Following the introduction of hospital insurance in most provinces, the Hall Commission recommended an expansion<lb/> in the number of physicians by increasing medical school intake and opening four new medical schools in 1964.<lb/> These recommendations were progressively implemented and lead to a peak of 1,835 medical graduates in 1985.<lb/> The 1984 workforce study into physician manpower in Canada (1980-2000) and a subsequent study by Barer and<lb/> Stoddart in 1991 recommended a reduction in medical school intake in order to avoid a physician surplus.<lb/> Consequently, the number of medical graduates fell to 1,516 in 1999. Recommendations made in 1999 by the Task<lb/> Force on Physicians Supply are to increase medical school intake to 2,000 students per year.<lb/> France<lb/> France has employed a numerus clausus for admission in the second year of undergraduate medical school since<lb/> 1971. Due to concerns over a surplus of physicians, the numerus clausus has been reduced progressively since<lb/> 1980 to bottom out at 3,500 students in 1993. Since then, the numerus clausus has increased as a consequence of<lb/> a projected shortage of physicians in 2010-2015. The numerus clausus has been set at 4,100 students in 2001 and<lb/> 5,100 students in 2002.</table>
