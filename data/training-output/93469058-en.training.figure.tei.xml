            <figDesc>guarantees extended to bonds issued by commercial banks<lb/>  individual bond guarantees in countries where public institutions borrow from capital<lb/> markets.<lb/> The second group consists of contingent liabilities arising from projects realised under PPP<lb/> models. PPPs are long term contractual arrangements between the government and a private partner<lb/> whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the associated risks<lb/> (OECD, 2012). Here the coverage is the government liabilities in the PPPs, which are explicit and<lb/> contingent. In this context, PPP contingent liabilities include:<lb/>  financial guarantees in the form of credit and refinancing guarantees<lb/>  revenue guarantees<lb/>  exchange rate guarantees<lb/>  termination payment commitments<lb/>  debt assumption commitments<lb/>  sub-sovereign creditworthiness guarantees.<lb/> The third sub-group consists of government sponsored insurance programmes. Here, the<lb/> scope again is explicit commitments by central government, which are also contingent upon some<lb/> future events. Therefore, fully private insurance programmes are outside the scope of this study.<lb/> Government sponsored insurance programmes are:</figDesc>

            <figDesc>presents the increase in the level of contingent liabilities in the European context for the<lb/> period 2007-2014. The data illustrate that in both the Euro Area (EA19) and the EU as a whole<lb/> (EU28), there was significant increase in the stock of contingent liabilities in 2008 and 2009, before<lb/> the gradual decrease in 2010 and 2011. The peak in 2009 reflects the large exposures of the European<lb/> governments under the financial sector support programmes (in the form of guarantee schemes), and<lb/> the subsequent decrease is largely the result of decreased exposures in Germany, Ireland, the<lb/> Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Eurostat, 2015).</figDesc>

THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS<lb/> IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT<lb/> The first section of this part presents the summary results of the OECD survey to provide readers<lb/> with an overview of public debt managers&apos; involvement in contingent liability management across<lb/> countries. This part then analyses three categories of contingent liabilities; government credit<lb/> guarantees, contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and government sponsored insurance programmes,<lb/> and includes discussions on these policy areas from a PDM perspective.<lb/> 2.1. Summary of the OECD survey results<lb/> The OECD Bond Market and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a survey on the role of<lb/> public debt managers in contingent liability management in late 2013 among 34 OECD Countries and<lb/> 2 non-OECD Countries (Brazil and South Africa). The survey questions were sent through e-mails to<lb/> the authorities of DMOs and 31 OECD and 2 non-OECD countries responded to the survey.<lb/> According to the survey results, out of the 33 DMOs, 22 indicated that they have some role in the<lb/> management of contingent liabilities. Figure 4 illustrates this result as a percentage.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The effect of the global financial crisis on the role of DMOs<lb/> To summarise, the main findings of the OECD survey on the role of public debt managers in<lb/> contingent liability management are:<lb/>  Around two-thirds of the DMOs responding to the survey have some role in contingent<lb/> liability management.<lb/>  Government credit guarantees is the sub-category of contingent liabilities that the DMOs<lb/> most actively engage.</figDesc>
