			<head>LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF: A LITERATURE REVIEW<lb/> ABSTRACT<lb/></head>

			<p>With learning support staff an increasing part of the school workforce that is assuming more and more<lb/> teaching related responsibilities, attention has grown as to how their skills and practices can have the<lb/> greatest impact on students. &quot; Learning support staff &quot; are defined as those school staff whose main function<lb/> is to assist the work of teachers. This paper reviews country approaches to the roles and responsibilities of<lb/> learning support staff. It discusses the different mechanisms through which learning support staff can have<lb/> an impact on teachers&apos; work and student achievement and reviews the related empirical evidence. While<lb/> the available research provides mixed evidence on the impact of learning support staff on student<lb/> achievement, it suggests that learning support staff may improve teaching and learning as long as adequate<lb/> strategies for their training, deployment and use are implemented. There are several ways through which<lb/> learning support staff may have a positive impact on student attainment. Students receive more<lb/> individualised help and attention from either the support staff or the teacher; and the learning environment<lb/> can be made more flexible possibly leading to increased engagement and inclusion of children in<lb/> classroom activities. Also, teachers receive specialist support and assistance with their administrative and<lb/> planning tasks, granting them more time for their core responsibilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper reviews the research literature on the role and impact of school staff whose main function<lb/> is to assist the work of teachers (learning support staff). Teaching staff are the most important<lb/> within-school resource input influencing student learning outcomes, and constitute the greatest proportion<lb/> of education expenditure. Hence, improving the efficiency of schooling depends to a large degree on the<lb/> ability of the school system to effectively manage teaching resources. As part of school staff, learning<lb/> support staff can have an important role in improving teaching effectiveness by supporting teachers and<lb/> providing children with additional support.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the last two decades, there has been increasing attention by researchers and policymakers to<lb/> learning support staff and their potential contribution in driving up standards in schools. The perspective of<lb/> the paper is twofold: to analyse learning support staff as a resource in itself; and to analyse how learning<lb/> support staff affect teachers&apos; use of time and impact on student achievement. The paper describes<lb/> countries&apos; current approaches to the use of learning support staff, including the way their role and<lb/> responsibilities are defined.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, a definition of learning support staff is provided, and<lb/> their major roles and tasks are discussed. This also includes a discussion of the main trade-offs involved in<lb/> the use of the related school resources. Section 3 reviews the use of learning support staff across a number<lb/> of countries and analyses potential advantages and disadvantages of given approaches. Section 4 provides<lb/> an overview of the existing empirical evidence of the impact of learning support staff on student<lb/> achievement. Finally, in section 5, the main conclusions of the use of learning support staff are discussed.<lb/> EDU/WKP(2015)14<lb/></p>

			<head>2. LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<lb/> 2.1. Definition<lb/></head>

			<p>There are a variety of job titles associated with school staff whose main function is to assist the work<lb/> of teachers. These include &quot; learning support assistants &quot; , &quot; non-teaching assistants &quot; , &quot; classroom assistants &quot; ,<lb/> &quot; learning support staff &quot; , &quot; teaching assistants &quot; , &quot; teacher aides &quot; and &quot; classroom support staff &quot; . This reflects<lb/> the diversity of training, functions, working conditions, contracts and pay associated with this group of<lb/> professionals. In many countries, these professionals have experienced an increase in their responsibilities<lb/> and tasks, from helping teachers with routine and non-teaching tasks to engage in pedagogical activities<lb/> with students (<ref type="biblio">Groom, 2006</ref>).<lb/> This paper uses the term &quot; learning support staff &quot; (also referred to as simply &quot; support staff &quot; ), to<lb/> capture the real contribution that such staff make to both teaching and learning, providing support for<lb/> teachers and students, but also to the overall learning-related activities of schools. Support staff who help<lb/> the teacher in a range of teaching and non-teaching tasks and engage in the learning process through direct<lb/> interactions with students will therefore be considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>The scope of the paper does not include the use of staff who have the exclusive function of supporting<lb/> the inclusion of students with disabilities in mainstream education (e.g. teachers for students with special<lb/> education needs). However, to the extent that some learning support staff may have, among others, a role<lb/> in supporting students with disabilities, this paper may make some references to special education needs.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. The role and responsibilities of Learning Support Staff<lb/></head>

			<p>Ambiguity exists regarding which roles and responsibilities should be carried out by teachers, and<lb/> which by learning support staff. In their literature review, <ref type="biblio">Blatchford et al. (2002)</ref> identify numerous<lb/> studies that highlight difficulties in defining the boundaries between teaching and non-teaching roles.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Mortimore et al. (1992, cited in Blatchford et al., 2004</ref>) have also addressed this issue in relation to when it<lb/> is appropriate to consider support staff as &apos;substituting&apos; (i.e. developing routine tasks delegated to her/him)<lb/> or &apos;augmenting&apos; the teachers&apos; role (i.e. being involved in activities that enable the teacher to provide an<lb/> enhanced curriculum).<lb/> Recent studies identify an increasing blurring of these roles (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Cajkler and Tennant, 2009; Cremin<lb/> et al., 2005</ref>). Support staff are no longer undertaking only routine and administrative tasks that enable<lb/> teachers to focus on their teaching tasks, but have a multifaceted role that engages them in instructional<lb/> activities and allows them to support all the students they interact with, even if their role is to work with<lb/> mainly one child. Moreover, they support children&apos;s inclusion and act as a link and mediator between<lb/> different stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<p>The needs of the students are the school leader&apos;s main concern when allocating learning support staff,<lb/> and classrooms can be organised in different ways according to such needs. In many schools, support staff<lb/> are used to support children with learning difficulties in the same class, so that these students can stay<lb/> integrated in the class rather than being separated by levels of attainment. In other schools, learning<lb/> support staff may be used to allow the teacher to spend more time with children with greater needs.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Trade-offs involved in the use of learning support staff<lb/></head>

			<p>A frequently debated teacher policy issue is the trade-off between the average size of classes and the<lb/> average salary of teachers (assuming a given expenditure in salaries). Reduced class sizes potentially<lb/> improve in-class interaction and teachers&apos; working conditions, but require a larger number of teachers to<lb/> whom lower individual salaries may have to be offered. On the other hand, larger class sizes give room for<lb/> higher teacher salaries, potentially attracting better individuals to schools, but at the potential cost of<lb/> weakening the quality of classroom interaction. The use of learning support staff as a support for those<lb/> teaching larger class sizes adds complexity to this trade-off.<lb/></p>

			<p>Broadly speaking, further spending on schools can be used to either reduce student-teacher ratios (and<lb/> thereby employ more teachers and reduce average class size), or increase teachers&apos; average salaries, or<lb/> some combination of the two. An alternative strategy would be to focus additional spending on increasing<lb/> teachers&apos; average salaries and employing more support staff in schools. This would decrease student–adult<lb/> ratios in the classroom and thus form an alternative to reducing class sizes. This strategy would aim to both<lb/> make teaching more attractive and, through the greater use of support staff, enable teachers to focus more<lb/> on their specialist expertise. There could even be arguments for reconfiguring staffing in some schools so<lb/> that fewer teachers are employed, but they are paid substantially more and provided with much more<lb/> extensive support (OECD, 2005).<lb/> Different approaches to the use of learning support staff in the trade-off between the average size of<lb/> classes and the average salary of teachers may have different effects on educational outcomes. For<lb/> example, larger classes where teachers are paid more, have more preparation time and additional teaching<lb/> support, may be more effective than smaller classes where teachers are paid less and have no learning<lb/> support staff.<lb/> Furthermore, the use of learning support staff in this trade-off also relates to another variable: student<lb/> learning time. The amount of instruction in schools, but also the extent to which instruction time is<lb/> effectively used, determines the extent to which student learning objectives (or curriculum) can be covered.<lb/> Similar levels of curriculum coverage can be reached through different instruction time allocations. If the<lb/> use of learning support staff improves the effectiveness of instruction, policy makers can reduce the<lb/> quantity of instruction without jeopardising the curriculum coverage through an increase in the number of<lb/> learning support staff in schools. Likewise, a reduction in instruction time and increased learning support<lb/> staff may enable teachers to dedicate more time to planning, preparing instruction and assessing students.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. APPROACHES TO LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF IN OECD COUNTRIES<lb/> 3.1. Use of learning support staff across OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>In many countries, learning support staff have become a significant part of the education workforce.<lb/> In 2010, in the 12 OECD countries for which data are available, there were on average 7.3 teacher aides<lb/> and teaching/research assistants per 1000 students in primary, secondary and non-tertiary education<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.1), compared to an average of 74.5 teachers and academic staff per 1 000 students<lb/> (OECD, 2012). The United Kingdom and the United States have the highest average ratio of support staff,<lb/> with 15.5 teacher aides and teaching/research assistants per 1 000 students. These two countries have<lb/> experienced significant increases of learning support staff in recent years. The number of support staff in<lb/> schools more than doubled in the United Kingdom in ten years, from 134 000 in 1997 to 346 000 in 2009,<lb/> with teaching assistants representing 52% of this group (<ref type="biblio">DfE, 2011</ref>). In the United States, the number of<lb/> support staff increased at an average rate of 48% during the 1990s (<ref type="biblio">French, 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Evidence from Australia, Finland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, shows<lb/> that the growth in the use of support staff in these countries has been partly due to policies of inclusive<lb/> education (<ref type="biblio">Takala, 2007; Bourke, 2009; Burton and Goodman, 2011; Ward, 2011</ref>). In these countries, the<lb/> deployment of support staff has been seen as the best strategy to create supportive and inclusive learning<lb/> environments, to ensure that all students, no matter what their needs are, receive adequate support that is<lb/> adapted to their difficulties and individual paces.<lb/></p>

			<head>United Kingdom<lb/></head>

			<p>In the United Kingdom, there are a wide variety of support staff roles, responsibilities and job titles.<lb/> Learning support staff receive the title of &apos;teaching assistant&apos; (TA), which also includes the &apos;higher level<lb/> teaching assistant&apos; (HLTA) role. Excluding special education support staff, other support staff titles include<lb/> &apos;minority ethnic pupil support staff&apos; (also referred to as &apos;bilingual support staff&apos;), &apos;student support staff&apos;<lb/> (includes learning mentors, education welfare officer, career advisors) and &apos;technicians&apos; (includes resource<lb/> teachers, music specialists, art technicians).<lb/></p>

			<p>There are four grades of teaching assistant, from level one, for candidates without previous experience<lb/> as a TA, to HLTA. Once TAs are in post, they need to follow training and development (vocational<lb/> qualification, or equivalent) in order to progress up to HLTA. What is required of TAs at each level varies<lb/> between schools and local authorities, but as TAs progress up the scale their autonomy and responsibility<lb/> increase. Their tasks include getting the classroom ready for lessons, helping children who need extra<lb/> support to complete tasks, helping teachers to plan learning activities and complete records, supporting<lb/> teachers in managing class behaviour and supervising group activities, among others. Many schools<lb/> employ teaching assistants with particular specialisms, including literacy, numeracy, or bilingual TAs,<lb/> among others (UK <ref type="biblio">Government, 2012</ref>). Qualification and experience requirements to become a TA are<lb/> determined by the Local Education Authority (LEA) and the individual school taking into account the<lb/> characteristics of the TA position that is offered.<lb/></p>

			<p>Three requirements typically exist for candidates to be considered for a selection process: good<lb/> reading, writing and numeracy skills; to have taken, or be willing to take, the local authority-run induction<lb/> programme; and to have some experience of working with children of the relevant age. The induction<lb/> programmes for TAs, run by the LEA, are designed to inform them of the context in which they will be<lb/> working and the way they will be supporting teaching and learning. They seek to help TAs understand<lb/> their role and give them plenty of ideas about how to fulfil it effectively. Induction programmes include<lb/> training in areas such as literacy, mathematics, behaviour management, inclusion or ICT in teaching,<lb/> among others (UNISON, 2014). In terms of wages, full-time TAs&apos; earnings range from GBP 12 000<lb/> to over GBP 17 000 a year, and for full-time HLTAs range between GBP 16 000 and GBP 21 000 a year,<lb/> depending on the LEA and the responsibilities of individual jobs (UK Government, 2012).<lb/> Prior to 2010, the UK government identified inclusion into mainstream school as the key to educating<lb/> students with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and other educational needs. Consequently, a<lb/> number of policy changes were implemented to increase the rights for children with different attainment<lb/> levels to receive education in a mainstream school. The National Agreement for England and Wales on<lb/> &apos;Raising Standards and Tackling Workload&apos; was introduced in 2003, leading to an increase in the number<lb/> of learning support staff in England and Wales. The National Agreement addressed teachers&apos; workload<lb/> issues and established the basis to reform the training, qualifications and career opportunities for support<lb/> staff in England and Wales.<lb/> The Higher Level Teaching Assistants (HLTA) policy was introduced in 2007 to identify and<lb/> recognise support staff who meet the teaching assistant standards, with one aim being to provide smoother<lb/> progression for support staff wishing to become fully qualified teachers (OECD, 2014b). In order to get<lb/> EDU/WKP(2015)14<lb/> this status, learning support staff undergo a specific training and assessment programme. The HLTA&apos;s<lb/> roles consist of supporting teachers in class, acting as specialist assistants in specific subjects, supervising<lb/> other support staff and participating in lesson planning and learning material development (<ref type="biblio">DfE, 2011</ref>).<lb/> HLTAs usually undertake more complex tasks and tend to work more independently than TAs, for<lb/> example they can lead a lesson in the absence of the teacher. There are four steps to reach HLTA status:<lb/> (i) if TAs have the support of their head teacher and line manager to access the training programme, they<lb/> can apply for LEA funding; (ii) once accepted, TAs start a training programme, which involves developing<lb/> the skills, knowledge and experience to the level required by the HLTA professional standards, tailored to<lb/> the candidates&apos; specific needs; (iii) after the training, candidates receive preparation for assessment, to<lb/> ensure full comprehension of the HLTA professional standards and the assessment tasks; and (iv) an<lb/> assessor visits the candidates&apos; school to verify whether they have met the standards (UNISON, 2014).<lb/> As noted previously, the number of support staff in schools has significantly increased in the<lb/> United Kingdom in the last fifteen years. Of all support staff, around 50% work in primary schools (with<lb/> 70% being teaching assistants), and 30% in secondary schools. The student-teaching assistant ratio is 33.5<lb/> in primary schools, and 80.1 in secondary schools. The same trend can be observed in spending on learning<lb/> support staff, which has doubled within a decade. In the course of 2008/9, schools spent on average<lb/> GBP 4.1 billion on learning support staff, and the amount was higher in schools with higher proportions of<lb/> disadvantaged students (<ref type="biblio">DfE, 2011</ref>). As the number of TAs has increased, the role of these professionals<lb/> has experienced an important transformation, from that of classroom helpers assisting the teacher in<lb/> non-teaching tasks, to one directed to the whole teaching and learning process (<ref type="biblio">Groom, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3.2 shows the relative growth in England of the number of teachers, teaching assistants and<lb/> students between 2000 and 2013. As it can be observed, despite the slight decrease in the number of<lb/> students during this period, the number of teaching assistants tripled (from 79 000 to 240 000, of which<lb/> about 14 000 were HLTAs), compared to an increase of 14% in the number of teachers (from 405 000 to<lb/> 465 000) (<ref type="biblio">Statistics UK, 2013</ref>). Consequently, the overall student-teaching staff ratio has fallen<lb/> dramatically. The change in the school workforce has resulted in increased school spending on teaching<lb/> assistants, which represented a cost of GBP 2.2 billion in 2010, within a total spending in schools of<lb/> GPB 35 billion, and compared to the GBP 19 billion spent on teachers (<ref type="biblio">Audit Commission, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Since the introduction of the Classroom Assistants Initiative in 1998 in Scotland, classroom assistants<lb/> (as learning support staff are called in Scotland) have been highly valued by schools, teachers and parents.<lb/> The Classroom Assistant Initiative was launched by the Scottish Executive as a pilot programme in 1998<lb/> and aimed to raise standards of attainment in Scottish schools. Over 4 000 classroom assistants were put in<lb/> place with the aim to reduce student-teacher ratios. In 2013 there were about 5 000 classroom assistants in<lb/> schools, almost 4 000 of them working in primary schools, and the student-adult ratio decreased to 15 in<lb/> primary schools and 17 in secondary schools (<ref type="biblio">Scottish Government, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Wales has recently introduced the Improving Schools Plan (2012) and the Action Plan to Promote the<lb/> Role and Development of School Support Staff in <ref type="biblio">Wales (2013)</ref>, which advance the recognition of the<lb/> contribution of support staff in the Welsh school system and at the same time improve their preparation,<lb/> effectiveness and professional development (OECD, 2014b). The Action Plan seeks to: (i) introduce<lb/> minimum qualifications for support staff; (ii) provide professional development opportunities for support<lb/> staff; and (iii) include support staff in the performance management of schools. In Wales, support staff<lb/> make up 44% of school staff, and undertake roles within schools that vary depending on the school leader<lb/> and teachers, such as serving as a classroom assistant, teaching assistant, language assistant and<lb/> administrative staff (OECD, 2014b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Australia<lb/></head>

			<p>The use of support staff has been strengthened in Australian schools, especially that of support<lb/> personnel dedicated to students with learning difficulties or disabilities. In Australia, the states and<lb/> territories have the major responsibility for education, and there is no specific federal legislation that<lb/> mandates for the type of support that should be provided to students with special needs. Therefore, each<lb/> state and territory defines its own strategy regarding dedicated support for students with special needs. In<lb/> Australia, the latter include students with disabilities, learning difficulties, students who are gifted or<lb/> talented, as well as students who are socially disadvantaged or whose first language is not English<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Forlin, 2001, 2006</ref>).<lb/> In Australia, during the 1980s and 1990s, many special schools closed and the majority of students<lb/> with learning difficulties or learning disabilities were integrated into mainstream schools and received<lb/> additional support. A withdrawal model was the dominant approach during these years, and students with<lb/> learning difficulties or disabilities were withdrawn to a resource or remedial room for part of the school<lb/> day (<ref type="biblio">Forlin, 2001</ref>). However, in the 1990s, this model was seen to have limitations, and concerns rose over<lb/> the appropriateness of the type of intervention provided. As a result, progress was made towards a more<lb/></p>

			<p>inclusive approach based on a range of support options, where in addition to the withdrawing practice,<lb/> support teachers were required to collaborate with regular class teachers, and support was provided to<lb/> students with difficulties in the same class (<ref type="biblio">Carroll et al., 2003; Forlin, 2006</ref>).<lb/> In Australia, differentiated support is provided by different personnel depending on children&apos;s needs.<lb/> Support in schools can be categorised into two main approaches: (i) support that is provided for students<lb/> with specific disabilities (e.g. intellectual, physical, autistic spectrum disorder, vision, hearing or<lb/> speech/language); and (ii) support that is available for students who have learning difficulties. Regarding<lb/> the latter, the different roles that exist in Australian schools are: Aboriginal and islander education officers<lb/> (AIEO), who assist and support teachers and Aboriginal students and act as a liaison between communities<lb/> and schools; education assistants, who support the teaching and learning of students (either with or without<lb/> specific learning requirements) by helping teachers to deliver education programmes and by encouraging<lb/> supportive and inclusive learning environments in primary schools; and ethnic assistants, who support the<lb/> specific English language needs of bilingual students (Australian Government, 2013).<lb/> In Queensland, support teachers are employed in all government schools to assist students with<lb/> learning difficulties, which is an umbrella concept that includes those students whose access to the<lb/> curriculum is limited due to any problem in one or more areas of literacy, numeracy and learning how to<lb/> learn (<ref type="biblio">Education Queensland, 1997, 2013</ref>). These professionals receive the title of &apos;support teacher<lb/> (learning difficulties)&apos; (ST(LD)) and they are required to team-teach with the classroom teacher. ST(LD)s<lb/> undertake responsibilities such as: identifying the needs of students and collecting, monitoring and<lb/> reporting these data; coordinating support provision and writing educational plans for students with special<lb/> needs; assessing and teaching students with learning difficulties; and collaborative planning with<lb/> classroom teachers and other specialists (<ref type="biblio">Bourke, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Furthermore, in Queensland, a whole-school approach is designed to cater for the learning needs of all<lb/> students, including: those in need of learning support; those who have educational support needs arising<lb/> from a disability; those who are gifted and talented; and those learning English as a second or additional<lb/> language or dialect (EAL/D); or a combination of these. This approach to supporting student learning<lb/> directs support to different levels of need in response to student achievement data. There are three layers<lb/> that represent a continuum of support for student learning, based on needs identified through ongoing<lb/> monitoring and assessment data. These are: differentiation, focused teaching, and intensive teaching<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Education Queensland, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>New Zealand<lb/></head>

			<p>Between 1995 and 2000, the Ministry of Education of New Zealand developed the Special Education<lb/> 2000 initiative, with a focus on inclusiveness. As part of this initiative, the Resource Teacher: Learning and<lb/> Behaviour (RTLB) service was established in 1998/9, to provide a more consistent approach to catering for<lb/> students with additional learning and behavioural needs. The service was divided into clusters of schools<lb/> based on designated geographical areas to provide a shared service to the schools within given areas (New<lb/> Zealand <ref type="biblio">Government, 2009</ref>). As a result, 500 special education teachers were reformed into RTLBs, and<lb/> another 250 positions were created to ensure a ratio of one RTLB to 750 students. A postgraduate<lb/> professional development program was created to prepare RTLBs (<ref type="biblio">Thomson et al., 2003</ref>).<lb/> In 2004, an Education Review Office (ERO) report highlighted a need for more consistency in the<lb/> delivery of the RTLB service across New Zealand. This report found many positive examples of RTLB<lb/> practice, with 62.5% of the clusters able to provide evidence of the improvements the service had made to<lb/> student achievement. However, ERO expressed concern that 37.5% of the clusters could provide little or<lb/> no evidence the service had made a difference, and that only 20% of the clusters could provide evidence of<lb/> improvements in Māori student achievement. This report made some recommendations for improvement to<lb/> the service and an RTLB Project Team was formed to develop the Resource Teacher: Learning and<lb/> Behaviour (RTLB) Policy and Toolkit (2007). This document provided schools with guidelines for the<lb/> management and accountability of the RTLB (<ref type="biblio">New Zealand Government, 2009, 2012, 2014a</ref>).<lb/> In 2009, ERO reviewed the RTLB service again and found that over half of the clusters were not well<lb/> managed, with needs and priorities not identified or RTLBs not employed appropriately, not properly<lb/> supported or ineffectively monitored. In addition, ERO found some inconsistencies due to the large<lb/> number of clusters (approximately 200 by 2009). The ERO report recommended a review of the cluster<lb/> model to ensure a more effective delivery, management and allocation of resources (New Zealand<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Government, 2009</ref>). As a result, a new RTLB cluster system started at the beginning of 2012, and clusters<lb/> were restructured and reduced from 200 to 40. Each of these 40 clusters was attached to a lead school<lb/> responsible for the governance and operation of the RTLB service for that cluster, and for appointing the<lb/> cluster manager and practice leader. The cluster managers have overall responsibility for the daily<lb/> management and coordination of the service across the cluster, and practice leaders are RTLBs with<lb/> additional responsibilities for professional supervision, performance reviews, and leading teams that focus<lb/> on specialist areas. Each cluster is now required to conduct a needs analysis to inform the cluster&apos;s future<lb/> practice and decision-making. Moreover, the cluster manager is responsible for annual reviews and<lb/> professional development of RTLBs. This professional development should be based on identified needs,<lb/> planned, led by credible facilitators, responsive to the cluster strategic plan and funded at cluster level<lb/> (New Zealand Government, 2014b).<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2013, there were 900 RTLBs working with children experiencing learning or behaviour difficulties,<lb/> providing classroom teachers with special teaching strategies, introducing class or school-wide<lb/> programmes, or working directly with individual children or small groups of children. RTLBs work closely<lb/> with classroom teachers, the Ministry of Education, specialists and support staff, and are employed by and<lb/> based in schools. If a cluster of schools wants to establish an RTLB, the schools in the cluster must identify<lb/> which one will have the dedicated office/interview room, taking into account which one is the most<lb/> centrally located in the cluster, the largest and the one housing similar services. RTLBs work in primary,<lb/> intermediate, as well as secondary schools, and have a salary that can range from NZD 35 000 to<lb/> NZD 73 000 depending on the years of experience and qualifications (New Zealand Government, 2014b).<lb/> Some of the RTLB positions are dedicated to focus on the learning needs of Māori students. In these cases,<lb/> a Māori RTLB may work entirely with Māori immersion schools. Some are employed within a cluster and<lb/> others work across more than one cluster. Māori RTLBs&apos; allocation to clusters depends on the cluster<lb/> committee. This initiative recognises the high number of Māori students experiencing learning and<lb/> behaviour difficulties in regular schools (<ref type="biblio">New Zealand Government, 2012, 2014a, 2014b</ref>).<lb/> For a teacher to become an RTLB, she/he must be a trained teacher with the full New Zealand teacher<lb/> registration and a current practising certificate. They must also; have either attained (or be in process of<lb/> attaining) the Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Teaching (Learning and Behaviour), or attained this<lb/> qualification within the three years of starting work as an RTLB; have the academic prerequisites to enter<lb/> the mentioned Postgraduate Diploma; and have previous experience working with students with learning<lb/> and behaviour needs (New Zealand Government, 2014a).<lb/> All clusters are provided operational funding to run their cluster. This funding is calculated depending<lb/> on the cluster needs identified during the RTLB data gathering process, and is provided for: educational<lb/> support (e.g. assistance to students needing individual support); to release time for classroom teachers to<lb/> meet with RTLB; and for professional development for departments, syndicates or schools to enhance<lb/> skills in behaviour management or curriculum development (New Zealand <ref type="biblio">Government, 2014b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The Nordic Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) have developed a similar approach<lb/> for the use of learning support staff, based on the inclusion of diversity in comprehensive schools and the<lb/> right of all children, regardless of their needs, to individualised support. In Denmark, Finland and Norway,<lb/> support staff are not responsible for planning, undertaking or evaluating the actual teaching, and are used<lb/> as flexible, practical assistants for teachers, enabling them to focus on teaching. In these countries, learning<lb/> support staff also support children in a range of activities and tasks, and are used as a link in schools<lb/> between different stakeholders with the aim of improving personal relations between students, between<lb/> students and teachers, and between families and schools.<lb/> In Finland, the use of support staff (known as teaching assistants) has been increasing since the<lb/> introduction of this role in the 1980s. Previously, and since 1967, technical assistants were used in schools<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Takala, 2007</ref>). After the introduction of the Basic Education Act in 1998, every child has the right to<lb/> receive the support of qualified professionals in mainstream education schools. The support received by<lb/> comprehensive school students is classified into three approaches: general, intensified, and special support,<lb/> depending on the duration and extent of the support (Finnish National Board of <ref type="biblio">Education, 2010</ref>). Every<lb/> child is entitled to general support. If general support is not enough, intensified support is provided, and if<lb/> intensified support is not sufficient, special support is given. Intensified support is provided to students<lb/> with special learning needs, and includes remedial teaching, part-time special education (for children with<lb/> speech disorders, reading or writing difficulties, learning difficulties in mathematics or foreign<lb/> languages, etc.), school assistant or interpretation services. The number of students receiving intensified<lb/> support amounted to 35 000 in 2013 (6.5% of all comprehensive school students), a 95% increase from<lb/> 2011 (Official Statistics of Finland, 2013).<lb/> Teaching assistants can work with the same class, or with different teachers and different classes, and<lb/> their main goal is to help children during the learning process by teaching individual students, small groups<lb/> or the whole class in substitution of the teacher. Moreover, these professionals can monitor the progress of<lb/> more disadvantaged children and provide them with more individualised attention. Their tasks also include<lb/> assisting the teacher; managing children&apos;s behaviour; and planning and organising activities. Bilingual<lb/> assistants are also available for newly arrived immigrant students (<ref type="biblio">Andersen, 2010; Takala and Uusitalo-<lb/>Malmivaara, 2012</ref>). The education requirements for a Teaching Assistant position in</p>

			<figure>Finland consist of a<lb/> one-year Teaching Assistant vocational course.<lb/> In Denmark, learning support staff (also known as teaching assistants, TAs) have been introduced<lb/> recently, with influence from the Finnish approach. In 2009, the Danish Ministry of Education launched<lb/> &quot; The School Development Project &quot; . As a part of this project, between 2009 and 2012, approximately 125<lb/> Danish primary schools (in 30 municipalities) were involved in pilot programmes using TAs in<lb/> comprehensive schools (from pre-school up to Year 10) with the aim of improving students&apos; learning and<lb/> social outcomes. The evaluation of the programme (Rambøll, 2011) showed a positive impact of the use of<lb/> TAs in primary schools, especially for disadvantaged students (the conclusions of the report are explored<lb/> in section 4.1.). The nationwide use of TAs in Denmark has, however, since been discontinued. But<lb/> smaller, locally financed programmes continue in a number of municipalities.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Norway, learning support staff (known as assistants) are employed, among other things, to support<lb/> teachers with their instruction. According to the municipalities, an increase in student numbers and a desire<lb/> to give more individual attention to students are the main reasons for employing classroom assistants. In<lb/> 2013-2014, there were 8 200 assistants (in full-time equivalents <ref type="biblio">[FTE]</ref>) in primary and lower secondary<lb/> education, representing almost 13% of all FTE teachers and assistants. The number of assistants in<lb/> Norwegian schools has increased 25% since 2006/07 compared to a 6% increase in teacher numbers during<lb/> the same period. In pre-primary schools, the use of assistants is even more widespread and has been<lb/> increasing steadily. In 2012, there were 37 719 assistants working in kindergartens (a 7% increase since<lb/> 2008), while the number of teachers has decreased 4% during the same period (Norwegian Directorate for<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Education and Training, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Assistants in Norway don&apos;t usually possess formal teacher qualifications. A questionnaire (based on<lb/> responses from 96 school administrators and 174 assistants) about the assistants&apos; background and the tasks<lb/> they perform shows that the assistants&apos; highest completed education is usually upper secondary school, and<lb/> many have a qualification in &quot; health care, childhood and youth &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Rambøll, 2010</ref>). Data from Statistics<lb/> Norway show that almost 20% of assistants in primary and lower secondary education, and 23.4% of<lb/> assistants in pre-primary education, have a trade certificate in Child Care and Youth Work (Norwegian<lb/> Directorate for Education and <ref type="biblio">Training, 2013</ref>). The Rambøll survey shows that an assistant&apos;s main tasks<lb/> are to support teachers; assist students with practical, social, personal and educational support; and<lb/> occasionally take responsibility for instruction. According to the survey, 52% of assistants in primary and<lb/> lower secondary education stated that they help the teachers daily by supporting students with difficulties<lb/> in smaller groups, and 17% stated that they provide daily instruction in class without guidance from a<lb/> teacher.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Swedish education system, diversity is highlighted as an asset for teaching. According to the<lb/> Education Act, individualised extra support is provided to students at risk of not meeting attainment<lb/> standards. The National Curriculum for compulsory education establishes that this should be organised in a<lb/> way that individual solutions are possible for all students, so that students with difficulties of any type can<lb/> receive various forms of support (<ref type="biblio">Swedish Government, 2011; OECD, 2011b</ref>). Yet, there are no clear<lb/> guidelines on how the support should be designed. As a result, municipalities and schools have a great deal<lb/> of freedom to design their own approach for supporting students with difficulties (<ref type="biblio">Lindqvist, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Data on assistant numbers in Sweden is only available for pre-school education. However,<lb/> information exists regarding the number of students who received additional support. Around 40% of<lb/> students receive additional support at some point during their compulsory education (<ref type="biblio">Emanuelsson and<lb/> Persson, 2003; Giota and Lundborg, 2007</ref>). One of the various forms of support available, to assist with the<lb/> growing immigrant population in Swedish schools, is language support. In the last decade, the number of<lb/> children with a mother tongue other than Swedish in pre-school has more than doubled from 40 000 in<lb/> 2001 to 92 900 in 2011 (<ref type="biblio">Swedish Government, 2013</ref>). As a result, 20% of children in pre-school have a<lb/> mother tongue other than Swedish. These students can receive instruction in their mother tongue in schools<lb/> by a teacher or an assistant if they cannot sufficiently follow the teaching in Swedish (<ref type="biblio">Swedish<lb/> Government, 2011</ref>). In 2005, 14.5% of six-year-olds who attended the pre-school class had a first language<lb/> other than Swedish and, of these, 46.6% received a first language support (OECD, 2010).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Potential benefits of the use of learning support staff<lb/></head>

			<p>A range of studies show a positive perception from different stakeholders regarding the work of<lb/> learning support staff. Parents, teachers and principals tend to value support staff&apos;s contribution in terms of<lb/> teaching effectiveness, classroom management, students&apos; learning outcomes and children&apos;s inclusion.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1. Benefits to student learning<lb/></head>

			<p>Learning support staff&apos;s work can have a positive impact on student attainment through a range of<lb/> channels such as individual attention, behaviour management and children&apos;s inclusion. This section<lb/> presents an overview of the potential benefits learning support staff can bring to children&apos;s learning.<lb/></p>

			<head>EDU/WKP(2015)14<lb/> Improved learning experience<lb/></head>

			<p>Using learning support staff decreases student–adult ratios in the classroom and increases<lb/> individualised attention so that students receive more individual help and attention from either the support<lb/> staff or the teacher. This improves the learning experience for children, meaning that students&apos; learning<lb/> needs are more likely to be met, which is likely to lead to better achievement. This idea is supported by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Blatchford et al. (2002, 2004</ref>), who report positive teachers&apos; views about the contribution of support staff<lb/> to student achievement. Most teachers noted that support staff&apos;s work provides children with greater<lb/> opportunities for individualised attention, learning support and feedback. Learning support staff are skilled<lb/> professionals that spend a greater amount of one-to-one time with children, which enables them to adapt<lb/> their support and attention to children&apos;s real needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of support staff to enable smaller group sizes that are monitored by both the teacher and the<lb/> support staff allows children to be more engaged in classroom activities. In addition, groups can be<lb/> structured using different criteria, depending on the objective that is sought, i.e. students with learning or<lb/> behaviour difficulties can be grouped together in order to receive additional and specialised support from a<lb/> prepared professional, or can be separated and assigned to different groups with their peers, who can adopt<lb/> a teaching role with them, and contribute to their inclusion.<lb/></p>

			<head>Classroom environment and behaviour management<lb/></head>

			<p>Classroom climate is an important contributor to student achievement: the better the classroom<lb/> disciplinary climate, the more time spent on actual teaching and learning (<ref type="biblio">Mortimore et al., 1988; Muijs<lb/> and Reynolds, 1999</ref>). In addition, evidence shows that a positive classroom climate is associated with both<lb/> cognitive and motivational outcomes, including improved academic performance, motivation, engagement,<lb/> school satisfaction, self-esteem and fewer disruptive behaviours (<ref type="biblio">Baker, 1999; Patrick et al., 2011; Reyes<lb/> et al., 2012</ref>). The idea that a better classroom climate is associated with more time spent on teaching and<lb/> learning is supported by teachers&apos; perceptions as provided in the OECD Teaching and Learning<lb/> International Survey (TALIS) (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2009, 2014a</ref>), showing that classroom disciplinary climate 1 and<lb/> time spent on teaching and learning are positively related, with an average correlation of 0.5 among the<lb/> participating countries – ranging from 0.21 in Japan to 0.65 in Australia. In addition, TALIS separates the<lb/> variance for the index of classroom disciplinary climate in three components: teacher, school and country,<lb/> with the aim of understanding to what extent the variation in responses to this variable is accounted for at<lb/> each level. The variance accounted for at the school and at the country levels are minimal (7% and 8%<lb/> respectively), while the majority of the variance (84%) in classroom disciplinary climate responses lies<lb/> with the individual teacher (OECD, 2014a). In other words, the disciplinary climate depends mostly on the<lb/> practices put in place in the classroom itself, and to a lesser extent on the socialisation of the school or the<lb/> country within which a teacher resides. With this in mind, the work of learning support staff can contribute<lb/> to more productive, focused and relaxed environments, and more time on tasks due to assistance with<lb/> behaviour management and individual support. Cajkler and <ref type="biblio">Tennant (2009)</ref> support this idea and point to<lb/> the fact that a more active interaction between the students and the teacher or support staff helps children<lb/> to better understand the task, which reduces the scope for children to cause behavioural problems, given<lb/> that they are more motivated and engaged with it. By contributing to increased time on task, defined as the<lb/> percentage of time spent on teaching and learning, learning support staff&apos;s work in the classroom provides<lb/> all students with a greater opportunity to learn.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cover for teacher absences<lb/></head>

			<p>Schools lose significant productive time due to teacher absenteeism. An analysis made by the Audit<lb/> Commission for England (<ref type="biblio">Audit Commission, 2011</ref>) found that teachers in English primary and secondary<lb/> schools were absent on average for 5.7 days annually, with an estimated cost of GBP 500 million yearly. In<lb/> the United States, 5.3% of teachers are absent on a given day, which represents a total cost of<lb/> USD 4 billion annually due to substitute teachers and associated administrative expenses (<ref type="biblio">Miller, 2012</ref>). In<lb/> addition to this cost, the absence of a teacher has negative effects in terms of the quality and the continuity<lb/> of teaching, which may render difficult the coverage of the full curriculum and result in a poorer learning<lb/> experience for students. Research on teacher absenteeism (<ref type="biblio">Varlas, 2001; Miller et al., 2008; Clotfelter et<lb/> al., 2007</ref>) shows that it reduces instructional intensity and creates discontinuities and disruptions to the<lb/> learning process. Moreover, schools usually hire low qualified substitutes who lack knowledge of students&apos;<lb/> levels and rhythms, which overall results in reduced student achievement that is even more noticeable for<lb/> disadvantaged students. <ref type="biblio">Miller et al. (2008)</ref> estimate that each 10 days of teacher absences reduce students&apos;<lb/> mathematics achievement by 3.3% of a standard deviation: the equivalent to the difference between<lb/> &quot; having a novice teacher and an experienced one &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>In this context, learning support staff can provide classroom cover in the absence of the main class<lb/> teacher, and contribute to a saving for the school in terms of covering expenses of hiring a substitute<lb/> teacher. Learning support staff are trained and qualified professionals who have a good knowledge of<lb/> students&apos; levels and the procedures and routines of the classroom, which enables them to provide an<lb/> effective instruction whenever the teacher is absent, ensuring the full provision of content and continuity of<lb/> teaching.<lb/></p>

			<head>Children&apos;s inclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Learning support staff can contribute to children&apos;s inclusion and ensure that all children, regardless of<lb/> their situation (e.g. disability, language, family income, cultural background, gender or ethnic origin), can<lb/> participate and engage in the social and academic experience of schooling with equal opportunities<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Cajkler and Tennant, 2009; Ebersold, 2003; Thomas, 1997</ref>). According to <ref type="biblio">Cremin et al. (2005)</ref>, the use of<lb/> certain approaches to the deployment of these staff has appeared &quot; to systematise the allocation of teacher<lb/> and assistant time and attention to all children &quot; and to prevent children from experiencing both lack of<lb/> attention or oversaturation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries such as Australia, Finland and the United Kingdom use bilingual assistants (also referred to<lb/> as &quot; minority ethnic pupil support staff &quot; or &quot; ethnic assistants &quot; ) to support the specific language needs of<lb/> bilingual students and students whose first language is not the language of instruction, as a way of<lb/> including migrant students and those from ethnic minorities. In addition, these professionals can act as a<lb/> liaison between the school and migrant and ethnic minority communities, and enhance families&apos;<lb/> participation in school activities.<lb/> A good example of this is a project launched in 2012 in Prague called &quot; Foreigners as Teaching<lb/> Assistants &quot; (META, 2013) which aimed to support the employment of foreigner long-term residents in<lb/> Prague with former pedagogical education as &quot; Teaching Assistants for Migrant Pupils &quot; . The programme<lb/> involved requalification courses, including pedagogical and Czech language courses, the creation of<lb/> teaching assistant positions and the creation of a job club to provide individual employment counselling to<lb/> the participants. As a result of the project, 29 immigrants were re-qualified as teaching assistants and 22<lb/> were employed in primary schools.<lb/></p>

			<head>An alternative to grade repetition<lb/></head>

			<p>In some countries, grade repetition is typically used as a strategy to respond to individual low<lb/> performance. Data from PISA shows that across OECD countries, an average of 12% of 15-year-olds<lb/> reported that they had repeated a grade at least once. In Japan and Norway, virtually no 15-year-old student<lb/> had repeated a grade, while in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain over 30% reported to<lb/> have repeated at least one grade either in primary or secondary school (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.3).<lb/> Evidence shows that grade repetition is costly and ineffective in improving students&apos; performance: the<lb/> academic benefits are minimal and short-lasting, and there is an increased likelihood of not earning a<lb/> qualification or of only earning a lower secondary qualification. Requiring that students repeat grades<lb/> implies not only the direct expense of providing an additional year of education, but also an opportunity<lb/> cost for the individual and the society related to the delay of these students&apos; entry into the labour market.<lb/> The direct costs of grade repetition can amount to 10% or more of the annual national expenditure on<lb/> primary and secondary education in countries like Belgium and the Netherlands (see <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 3.3)<lb/> (Schleicher, 2014). In addition to this, grade repetition increases the likelihood of school failure and<lb/> dropout, and affects significantly more disadvantaged students, which widens the achievement gap and<lb/> increases inequalities (OECD, 2011a, 2013).<lb/> Figure 3.3 Use of grade repetition and direct costs across OECD countries (2012)<lb/></figure>

			<table>Source: OECD (2013), PISA 2012 Results: What Makes Schools Successful (Volume IV): Resources, Policies and Practices,<lb/> http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264201156-en.<lb/></table>

			<p>The use of learning support staff to provide additional and continuous support to struggling students<lb/> has been shown to be a valid alternative to grade repetition in helping those students match their peers&apos;<lb/> level of attainment. Supportive learning environments, consisting of monitoring learning progress and<lb/> detecting problems during the school year, can help students, especially those who are disadvantaged, to<lb/> improve their achievement, and prevent them from repeating a grade (<ref type="biblio">Schleicher, 2014</ref>). Evidence shows<lb/> that for children receiving additional support, their progress is more marked when they are supported on<lb/> specific aspects of learning in particular subjects (<ref type="biblio">Alborz et al., 2009</ref>). This supports the idea of<lb/> well-trained learning support staff pairing with teachers to support students, either individually or in<lb/> groups. Countries such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, apply automatic<lb/> progression across the whole period of compulsory schooling and, rather than requiring students to repeat a<lb/> grade, continuous support is offered to students with learning difficulties. Box 3.1 provides details on the<lb/> Finnish approach.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3.1 Individualised Support in Finland<lb/></head>

			<p>In Finland, in 1970, a policy of automatic student promotion combined with early intervention was adopted,<lb/> and individualised learning and differential instruction have become the basic principles. Learning environments are<lb/> tailored in a way that all students can achieve their potential, and they are neither tracked nor streamed by ability.<lb/> Every child in Finland has the right to individualised support by trained professionals as part of mainstream<lb/> schooling and all teachers are trained in diagnosing students with learning difficulties and in adapting their teaching<lb/> to their students&apos; varying learning needs and styles. As a result, grade repetition is almost inexistent – less than 2%<lb/> of students who leave compulsory education at the age of 16 have repeated a grade. In fact, grade repetition is<lb/> only an option after the nine-year comprehensive school, when students are allowed to opt for an additional year to<lb/> consolidate their knowledge or make up their minds about future steps.<lb/> In upper secondary school there is no grade repetition because modules are used instead of grades, and<lb/> students build their own learning schedules from a menu of courses offered at their school. Therefore, the<lb/> programme is flexible and the courses selected can be completed at a different pace, depending on students&apos;<lb/> abilities and personal situations. Rather than repeating an entire grade, a student may repeat only those courses<lb/> that he or she did not pass. As a result, only 4% of students drop out during general upper secondary school, half<lb/> of whom move to vocational educational institutions.<lb/> Evidence suggests that the success of Finnish PISA results is partly due to the relative better score of the<lb/> lowest scoring students. The excellent relative performance in PISA results of the low-performer Finnish students in<lb/> all domains could be seen to support the Finnish policy of supportive education. In other words, this suggests that<lb/> Finnish schools are better at including disadvantaged students in the learning process. In Finland, Learning<lb/> Support Staff (called teaching assistants) assist the teacher and support students and, when a teacher is absent,<lb/> can also do substitute teaching. In addition, teaching assistants in Finland can follow the students with more<lb/> difficulties during their years in school, which allow them to acquire an in depth knowledge of these children and to<lb/> support them adequately. Finally, the 2007-2012 government plan for education and research underlined the<lb/> importance of taking the presence of immigrant students in schools into account and introducing measures that<lb/> enable these students both to succeed in the national educational system and to receive lessons in their mother<lb/> tongue, e.g. the employment of immigrant staff schools to support immigrant students in their own language.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2. Benefits to teachers&apos; effectiveness<lb/></head>

			<p>Different studies show that teachers value the contribution learning support staff make to effective<lb/> teaching. Support staff complement the teaching process, and can also substitute for teachers in a set of<lb/> non-teaching and routine tasks. This section presents the potential benefit of support staff to teachers&apos; use<lb/> of time and teaching effectiveness.<lb/> EDU/WKP(2015)14<lb/></p>

			<head>Workload reduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Teachers are responsible for a range of tasks in addition to teaching, such as lesson preparation,<lb/> student assessment, in-service training and staff meetings, which are vital to ensure quality teaching.<lb/> According to TALIS, lower secondary teachers report spending the majority of their time teaching<lb/> (OECD, 2014a). As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.4, lower secondary teachers report spending on average 19<lb/> hours teaching per week (ranging from 15 hours in Norway to 27 hours in Chile). The other more common<lb/> activities of teachers are planning or preparing lessons (with 7 hours on average, ranging from 5 hours in<lb/> Finland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland to 10 hours in Croatia); and marking students&apos; work<lb/> (average of 5 hours). Other activities such as participation in school management, communication with<lb/> parents and extracurricular activities take an average of two hours or less per week each.<lb/></p>

			<p>Teachers&apos; working hours vary among countries, as well as the allocation of these hours between tasks.<lb/> In some countries, a large proportion of statutory working time is reported to be spent on teaching, and less<lb/> time is devoted to other tasks (for example in Chile, where teachers report spending 27 hours out of 29<lb/> teaching). In some other countries, teachers report spending a large amount of hours teaching but also<lb/> dedicate significant time to other tasks, which results in a comparatively larger amount of working hours<lb/> than their counterparts in other OECD countries (for example, the United States, where teachers report<lb/> spending 26.8 hours teaching while working 44.8 hours per week). Finally, in countries such as Japan or<lb/></p>

			<p>Singapore, teachers report spending substantially more time on other tasks related to their job (40.2 and<lb/> 38.0 hours per week, respectively) than they spend teaching (17.7 and 17.1 hours per week, respectively).<lb/> Learning support staff can be used in schools to reduce teachers&apos; workload, thus freeing time for<lb/> teachers to focus upon teaching tasks. By undertaking some routine duties and supporting teaching-related<lb/> tasks (e.g. prepare lessons and materials, monitor students&apos; progress, administrative tasks) as well as<lb/> teaching tasks (e.g. instruction to children in one-to-one, small-group or whole-class contexts), learning<lb/> support staff&apos;s work can enable teachers to concentrate on the tasks they are more skilled for or specialists<lb/> in, which contributes to a more effective use of human resources in schools, and to a reduction in the<lb/> amount of time dedicated to non-teaching tasks. In addition, teachers&apos; total working hours can be reduced<lb/> without affecting teaching effectiveness, preparation of lessons or students&apos; assessment.<lb/></p>

			<head>More effective use of time<lb/></head>

			<p>The presence of support staff can help teachers cope with disruptive student behaviour, which creates<lb/> a more productive atmosphere and allows the teacher to focus more on his or her teaching. The need for a<lb/> more effective use of time has been previously expressed by the OECD (2009) as a mechanism to ensure<lb/> that all students have an equivalent and maximum amount of learning opportunities.<lb/> TALIS 2013 results show that across countries with available data, in lower secondary education,<lb/> between 67% to almost 90% of time is spent on actual teaching and learning; between 5 and 12% of time is<lb/> spent on administrative tasks; and 9 to 20% of time is spent on keeping order in the classroom<lb/> (OECD, 2014a). <ref type="figure">Figure 3.5</ref> shows that country averages for time on task are below 80% in Abu Dhabi<lb/> (United Arab Emirates), Alberta (Canada), Australia, Brazil, Chile, Flanders (Belgium), France, Iceland,<lb/> Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, and the United<lb/> States. Teachers in these countries also spend more time than the TALIS country average (12.7%) on<lb/> maintaining order in class (the exception is Abu Dhabi, with a percentage of 12.6%). In Chile, France,<lb/> Iceland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore and Brazil, maintenance of order in class accounts<lb/> for more than 15% of lesson time, resulting in less time spent on teaching and learning. In these countries,<lb/> having two adults in the same class monitoring students&apos; behaviour could reduce time spent on<lb/> interruptions, which in turn would enable them (the teacher and the support staff) to be more effective in<lb/> their lesson delivery. Likewise, learning support staff can help teachers to cope with administrative tasks in<lb/> the classroom, which can account for a large proportion of time. Teachers in Brazil, Chile, Malaysia,<lb/> Mexico and Singapore spend on average more than 10% of lesson time on this kind of tasks, compared to<lb/> an average of 8% in TALIS participating countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important message from the TALIS 2013 data is that teachers do not feel fully prepared to<lb/> cope with some given teaching challenges. In the survey, teachers were asked to rate on a four-point scale,<lb/> ranging from &quot; low level of need &quot; to &quot; high level of need &quot; , their development needs for various aspects of<lb/> their work. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.6 it can be observed that across the 35 participating economies, 22.3% of teachers<lb/> rated their development need in &quot; Teaching students with special needs &quot; as high, 13.1% of teachers reported<lb/> a high level of need for &quot; Student behaviour and classroom management &quot; , and 12.7% rated as high their<lb/> level of need for &quot; Teaching in a multicultural or multilingual setting &quot; . In systems such as Australia,<lb/> England or Finland, where learning support staff deployment has been strengthened in recent years, fewer<lb/> teachers indicated having high levels of need in these areas.<lb/></p>

Approaches to the use of learning support staff in the classroom<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Cremin et al. (2005)</ref> developed and tested three models for deployment of support staff in British<lb/> schools, namely: (i) Room management, in which staff working in the classroom undertake different roles,<lb/> depending on the needs of the class and the number of staff available, including the Individual helper, who<lb/> works with an individual or a group on a teaching activity for 5-15 minutes, the Activity manager, who<lb/> concentrates on the rest of the class, normally separated in small groups of 4-8 students, and the Mover<lb/> (where applicable), who move equipment and deal with interruptions in order to free the other group from<lb/> distraction; (ii) Zoning, a model that allocates teachers&apos; and support staff&apos;s roles according to the<lb/> classroom &quot; geography &quot; and assigns groups of students to each professional; and (iii) Reflective teamwork,<lb/> in which teachers and support staff discuss in depth their collaboration as a team, and develop it<lb/> accordingly. The three models were assessed focusing on two kinds of outcomes: (i) student engagement;<lb/> and (ii) teachers&apos; and support staff&apos;s perceptions of their own effectiveness when using the models.<lb/> According to the authors, room management was reported to encourage independence in all the<lb/> children and benefited those with additional learning needs, who weren&apos;t seen as the only ones receiving<lb/> additional support. Moreover, greater communication and collaboration in the planning enabled teachers<lb/> and support staff to complement each other. Overall, this model appeared to have the most significant<lb/> effect on increasing student engagement. However, it implies a large amount of time devoted to<lb/> preparation, and it is not clear that this would be available under normal circumstances.<lb/> Secondly, zoning was considered to empower support staff who felt that the model enabled their<lb/> support to be more effective. Teachers also felt that zoning was a natural way to organise the classroom as<lb/></p>

			<p>it facilitated the monitoring of students&apos; work and behaviour. Moreover, the model was perceived to be<lb/> good for inclusion, as students with greater needs weren&apos;t separated into a different group. As a result,<lb/> students were more engaged, especially those with the lowest baseline engagement, and behaviour<lb/> improved. The use of these two models appeared to systematise the allocation of teacher and assistant time<lb/> and attention to all children, and to prevent them from receiving too little attention or from becoming<lb/> saturated with and dependent on support.<lb/> Finally, the reflective teamwork model, that forces support staff and teachers to give each other<lb/> quality communication time, resulted in an improvement in their effectiveness and relationship. The<lb/> authors concluded that a combination of the most effective elements of these three models could be used in<lb/> training teachers and support staff for a better use of teaching resources.<lb/> An alternative approach to these three models is co-teaching: a model that emphasises collaboration<lb/> and communication among all members of a team (usually a general teacher and a specialist/assistant) with<lb/> the purpose of jointly delivering instruction in a way that meets the needs of all students (<ref type="biblio">Dieker, 2001;<lb/> Friend, 2008</ref>). This approach has its roots in special education, but is now used in all subjects and<lb/> throughout all levels of general education. It involves the collaboration between a main teacher and an<lb/> assistant specialised in a particular field (e.g. mathematics, science, reading, language, cultural mediator).<lb/> It is, for example, being used to support students who have English as a Second Language (ESL) in<lb/> the United States, and in English for Foreign Learners (EFL) environments, and has been considered<lb/> beneficial in terms of motivation, students&apos; participation and cross cultural understanding (<ref type="biblio">Tajino, 2002;<lb/> Zehr, 2006; Haynes, 2007; Honigsfeld and Dove, 2008; Rahmanian and Haqshenas, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>A possible categorisation of co-teaching is as follows: (i) One teach, one assist, in which one teacher<lb/> leads instruction while the other circulates and assists individual students; (ii) Station teaching, in which<lb/> students are divided in three groups and rotate from station to station, being taught by the teachers at two<lb/> stations and working independently at the third; (iii) Parallel teaching, in which each teacher instructs the<lb/> same content to half the class group with one aim being to foster instructional differentiation and increase<lb/> student participation; (iv) Alternative teaching, in which one teacher works with a large group and the<lb/> other works with a small group for remediation, enrichment, or assessment, among others; (v) Team<lb/> teaching (or Teaming), in which both teachers share the responsibility of teaching to the whole class; and<lb/> (vi) One teach, one observe, in which one teacher leads instruction while the other gathers data on specific<lb/> students or the whole class (<ref type="biblio">Cook and Friend, 1995; Friend et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Other researchers have suggested different versions of co-teaching models which apply different<lb/> terminology to similar concepts. Haynes (2007) suggested six models of co-teaching between a general<lb/> education teacher and an ESL teacher. These models include (i) Teach and write, where one teacher<lb/> teaches while the other records the important points on a board; (ii) Station teaching (same as suggested<lb/> above); (iii) Parallel teaching; (iv) Alternative teaching; (v) Team teaching and (vi) Lead and support<lb/> (equivalent to One teach, one assist approach suggested above). Thus, variations can be introduced to this<lb/> approach, although co-planning, co-instructing and co-assessing are required for it to be considered co-<lb/>teaching.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A number of benefits of co-teaching have been suggested in the literature, including: an increased<lb/> understanding of all students&apos; needs, a more effective teaching and learning environment, a greater<lb/> exchange of knowledge and strategies between professionals, and decreased burnout for professionals<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Dieker, 2001; Dieker and Murawski, 2003</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Murphy et al. (2004)</ref> analysed the effects of co-teaching in<lb/> primary school science classes by science specialist student teachers and main primary teachers on<lb/> children&apos;s attitudes, and found positive effects on students&apos; enjoyment in science classes, as well as fewer<lb/> age or gender differences in their attitudes to science than children who had not participated in the project.<lb/> Other studies have tried to address the effectiveness of co-teaching on students&apos; achievement, though many<lb/> lack quantitative data. Murawski and Swanson (2001) conducted a meta-analysis of co-teaching research.<lb/> Out of 89 studies reviewed, they only identified 6 that provided sufficient quantitative information, all of<lb/> which were co-teaching experiments in the field of special education. While co-teaching was observed to<lb/> have positive effects, their analysis doesn&apos;t show a significant difference between co-teaching and regular<lb/> controlled classes. Some researchers state that this is because although co-teaching has big potential as a<lb/> strategy for improving students&apos; achievement, it is not easy to implement (<ref type="biblio">Friend 2008</ref>), and the right<lb/> model has to be used (<ref type="biblio">Abdallah, 2009</ref>). Many studies have tried to address the challenges facing the<lb/> successful implementation of co-teaching, including arranging instruction and planning time, introducing<lb/> creativity in instruction, building positive working relationships, clarifying roles, responsibilities and<lb/> philosophy of teaching, conducting evaluations, and ensuring administrative support (<ref type="biblio">Dieker, 2001;<lb/> Honigsfeld and Dove, 2008; Friend, 2008</ref>).<lb/> In a recent study, Takala and Uusitalo-Malmivaara (2012) followed the development of co-teaching in<lb/> four schools in Helsinki during the TUPA (bonus for results) project. The TUPA project offered funding<lb/> for training courses for comprehensive schools in Helsinki to promote co-teaching: rewarding schools if at<lb/> least 5% of their lessons in general education were co-teaching lessons in the school year 2010-2011. The<lb/> results showed low levels of co-teaching (two-five lessons per week), which didn&apos;t change during the<lb/> follow-up study one year later. This suggests that monetary incentives are not enough to encourage co-<lb/>teaching. Lack of planning was the main reason for not undertaking this approach, or not doing so more<lb/> often. In addition, confusion existed regarding roles, possibly due to the lack of training to co-teach.<lb/> However, co-teaching was viewed positively by the practitioners, who identified issues such as<lb/> professional development, sharing with other professionals, higher well-being, more time for students from<lb/> teachers, and better quality of teaching or improved inclusion of diversity.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4. Implementation aspects<lb/></head>

			<p>The extent to which the use of learning support staff in schools contributes to an improvement of<lb/> teaching and learning partly depends on the tasks and roles they undertake, as well as on the way they are<lb/> trained and deployed. This section presents implementation factors for the effective use of learning support<lb/> staff.<lb/></p>

			<head>Deployment within schools and classrooms<lb/></head>

			<p>The way learning support staff are deployed in schools can have a great impact on the effectiveness of<lb/> their work. In most cases, these professionals give in–class support to small groups of children who are low<lb/> performers or are having learning or behaviour difficulties. This leads to potential concerns as to the level<lb/> of preparation of support staff, i.e. if support staff are not adequately prepared, some students (those<lb/> working with support staff) may receive low quality attention and some others (those working with the<lb/> teacher) may receive high quality support. In some cases, though, teachers and learning support staff share<lb/> the responsibility of instruction, and allocate their roles according to students&apos; needs and their own areas of<lb/> expertise, for example, learning support staff can teach the whole class, while the teacher provides support<lb/> to students with learning difficulties. Thus, learning support staff deployment needs to ensure an effective<lb/> support for all students, whatever their needs are, in a range of different types of interaction (one-to-one,<lb/> small group or whole class attention).<lb/> Learning support staff usually work with various teachers, classes and groups, which can lead to<lb/> fragmented and inconsistent support, and may represent a challenge in terms of communication between<lb/> teachers and learning support staff. If learning support staff have to work with different teachers, less time<lb/> will be available for them to work as a team, and plan the class together, or engage in a reflection after the<lb/> session. Different studies (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Moyles and Suschitzky, 1997; Cremin et al., 2005; Alborz et al., 2009;<lb/> Webster et al., 2013</ref>) signal this as a big obstacle for support staff to provide effective attention and<lb/> teaching for students. Accordingly, the successful contribution of learning support staff in schools will<lb/> depend to a great extent on the quality of the partnership formed with teachers, and to ensure this, they<lb/> should have enough time allocated to work together before and after lessons.<lb/></p>

			<head>Training<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to provide support staff with the knowledge and preparation they need to face the different<lb/> challenges of their work, high quality specific training should be provided to them. Some studies<lb/> (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Blatchford et al., 2004; Cajkler and Tennant, 2009</ref>) consider training beneficial for learning support<lb/> staff&apos;s skills and job satisfaction, as well as in raising knowledge and confidence, which can be expected to<lb/> have a positive impact on the quality of support that students receive. In addition, they indicate that in<lb/> order to prepare future support staff appropriately, training should be integrated into classroom practice<lb/> (e.g. through induction programmes) and should be based in team working approaches from early stages<lb/> (e.g. via shared training and induction for teachers and support staff).<lb/> As previously mentioned, in the United Kingdom, there are no nationally specified requirements for<lb/> becoming a teaching assistant (TA), and each local authority and school outlines their own specific<lb/> requirements. However, local authorities offer the opportunity for training and development once teaching<lb/> assistants are in post. There are two levels at which TAs can be awarded the National Vocational<lb/> Qualification (NVQ) for teaching assistants: Level 2 is designed to be suitable for teaching assistants who<lb/> may be new to the profession, and Level 3 is designed to be suitable for experienced teaching assistants.<lb/> To achieve level 2, TAs need to show that they meet seven units of competence, four of which are<lb/> mandatory, namely: (i) help with classroom resources and records; (ii) help with the care and support of<lb/> students; (iii) provide support for learning activities; and iv) provide effective support for colleagues. The<lb/> remaining three can be chosen from a list of five options including: support literacy and numeracy<lb/> activities in the classroom; contribute to the management of student behaviour; and support the use of ICT<lb/> in the classroom. To achieve level 3, TAs must show that they meet ten units of competence, four of which<lb/> are mandatory, namely: (i) contribute to the management of student behaviour; (ii) establish and maintain<lb/> relationships with individual students and groups; (iii) support students during learning activities; and<lb/> (iv) review and develop one-self professional practice. The remaining six are chosen from nineteen further<lb/> options, including: observe and report on student performance; promote students&apos; social and emotional<lb/> development; and liaise effectively with parents (TES, 2013).<lb/> In Norway, teaching assistants do not need a diploma. However, almost 20% of TAs in primary and<lb/> lower secondary education and 23.4% of TAs in pre-primary education have a trade certificate in Child<lb/> Care and Youth Work. Child care and youth work consists of three main subject areas, including<lb/> (i) health-promoting work, which is concerned with the relationship between physical and mental health<lb/> and activities for children and adolescents; (ii) communication and interaction, which deals with the<lb/> development of children and adolescents&apos; self-esteem and confidence; and (iii) practice of vocation, which<lb/> is concerned with the different types of educational activities for children and adolescents. In addition, all<lb/> apprentices must be competent in basic skills, meaning that they have to be able to express themselves<lb/> orally and in writing; be able to read and understand specialist literature and plans; be able to calculate, use<lb/> numbers and counting in educational activities; and be able to use digital tools for documentation and<lb/> presentations and to instruct children in the use of these tools (Norwegian Directorate for Education and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Training, 2008</ref>).<lb/> The education of assistants in Finland currently consists of 40 study weeks, one study week being<lb/> equivalent to 40 hours of work. Different vocational institutes offer this education, which usually lasts one<lb/> year. Other qualifications, such as practical nursing, are also considered acceptable as sufficient<lb/> educational background for an assistant. The core aims in the study programmes of all institutions offering<lb/> this education are: (i) to gain knowledge about the work environment of the assistant, including relevant<lb/> laws and service systems in the society; (ii) to support human growth; (iii) to support functional ability;<lb/> iv) to guide learning. The education is linked to working life and students have a total of 12 weeks of<lb/> practice in the field, with the final examination being a skills test. This profession is regulated by the<lb/> National Board of Education (The Social and Health Institute in <ref type="biblio">Helsinki, 2006</ref>; Finnish National Board of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Education, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Roles and responsibilities<lb/></head>

			<p>It is typically the responsibility of the school management to ensure that the division of tasks and<lb/> functions between teachers and learning support staff is clear. A weak school management, unable to get<lb/> involved in clearly delineating staff&apos;s roles can lead to inconsistencies and variations in the way learning<lb/> support staff are used, as well as to task overlaps or mismatches. A clear definition of what are the<lb/> responsibilities of support staff and teachers in their work with students is key to improve teaching<lb/> effectiveness (<ref type="biblio">Webster et al., 2013</ref>). The inclusion of these professionals in the staff team would enable<lb/> them to participate in whole school decision-making, as well as clarifying teachers and learning support<lb/> staff&apos;s roles.<lb/></p>

			<head>Practices<lb/></head>

			<p>Learning support staff may not always have the desired positive effect if care is not taken with the<lb/> practices used. According to research (<ref type="biblio">Alborz et al., 2009; Blatchford et al., 2012; Webster et al., 2013</ref>), an<lb/> excessive use of practices such as withdrawing individual students from the class, working exclusively on<lb/> a one-to-one basis, or clustering the low-performing students in order to support their learning, may<lb/> actually create a barrier between those students that receive support and the rest of the class, and can have<lb/> a negative impact on their confidence and progress, as well as their ability to work independently.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to ensure the participation and engagement of all children in the class experience, learning<lb/> support staff should combine the support given to individual students with whole class work. Moreover,<lb/> these professionals should emphasise learning and understanding rather than task completion. With the<lb/> main objective being to promote students&apos; independence, learning support staff should avoid practices<lb/> consisting in providing answers and correcting mistakes, and instead give more time to students for<lb/> reflection and the enhancement of their participation in class.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF<lb/> 4.1. Learning support staff, student achievement and teachers&apos; work<lb/></head>

			<p>There is not a great deal of empirical evidence on the impact of learning support staff on student<lb/> learning. This section explores the results from available studies: ranging from those indicating that the use<lb/> of learning support staff can negatively affect children&apos;s progress, to those presenting evidence that these<lb/> professionals can improve student learning.<lb/> A large-scale study (<ref type="biblio">Gerber et al., 2001</ref>) examined data from Tennessee&apos;s Project STAR, a<lb/> longitudinal state-wide project in Tennessee (United States) designed to look at the effects of smaller class<lb/> sizes and the use of learning support staff from kindergarten to grade 3 of primary school. In Project<lb/> STAR, students entering kindergarten in autumn 1985, as well as teachers and teacher aides, 2 were<lb/> randomly assigned to one of three experimental interventions, namely: (i) a small class (13-17 students);<lb/> (ii) a regular class (22-26 students); and (iii) a regular class with a full-time teacher aide. Most students<lb/> remained in the same class throughout the four years, but teachers and teacher aides changed every year<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Gibbons and McNally, 2013</ref>, provide a good summary of the project). The full sample used by Gerber et<lb/> al. included more than 6 300 students in 79 schools across the state. Due to complexities with the sample<lb/> resulting from attrition problems (i.e. some students leaving the schools) and later accession to<lb/> experimental school programs (i.e. students moving to the treatment schools), which resulted in students<lb/> attending teacher aide classes (or small classes) for different lengths of time, the authors focused solely on<lb/> those students with particular patterns of participation (e.g. those who attended the same class throughout<lb/> the duration of the project) and used statistical controls to adjust for differential selectivity of students who<lb/> were more mobile. In addition, they controlled for gender, ethnicity, free meal eligibility and urbanity.<lb/> Overall, the results indicated that no significant differences in student achievement were found<lb/> between regular-size classes with or without teacher aides on any test in any grade. However, comparisons<lb/> between students in regular-size classes with teacher aides for between one and four years and those in<lb/> regular-size classes without teacher aides, or small classes, showed that students who had been in a<lb/> regular-size class with a teacher aide for 2 or 3 years scored higher in reading tests than their counterparts<lb/> in regular-size classes without support. On the other hand, students in regular-size classes with teacher<lb/> aides performed worse than those in small classes in all grades and on all tests. The authors suggested that<lb/> the lack of overall positive effects of teacher aides on student achievement could be solved through better<lb/> training and clearer roles for these staff, and stated that while the use of this kind of support may not have<lb/> an overall positive impact on learning, the deployment of these professionals to support specific students<lb/> might lead to higher achievement for those particular students, a question that their data did not allow to<lb/> investigate.<lb/> This question was later analysed by <ref type="biblio">Muijs and Reynolds (2003)</ref>, who studied the effect of using<lb/> trained learning support assistants to help students who were underachieving in mathematics, by using the<lb/> Numeracy Support Assistants (NSA) programme as a quasi-experimental design. The programme was<lb/> implemented as part of the Gatsby Mathematics Enhancement Programme Primary 3 project, and had the<lb/> primary objective to use more extensively trained learning support staff to support low achieving students<lb/> during and after mathematics lessons. It was conducted in 18 schools from two selected local education<lb/> authorities in the north east of England, starting in the summer term 2000. Students who were to be<lb/> targeted for support by the NSA were chosen by schools on the basis of test results and teacher judgement.<lb/> During the first phase of the project, NSAs were employed at key stage 1 (the first two years of primary<lb/> school in England, which comprises students between ages five and seven) to aid selected students during<lb/> mathematics lessons, by working with them both during the whole-class teaching segments and the<lb/> individual practice parts of lessons. NSAs had previously taken part in a variety of training activities as<lb/> part of the programme and were proposed roles such as: to observe and assess the group, providing<lb/> feedback for the teacher; to interact alongside the teacher; to take small groups in order to practise and<lb/> reinforce skills; to provide practical support; and to assess the children&apos;s progress. From the observation of<lb/> 208 lessons, NSAs were identified to: (i) support students by encouraging them, reinforcing or practising<lb/> skills and helping them with the content of the activity in the beginning of the class (in some cases this was<lb/> made in a separate class); (ii) help a group of low achievers during the main delivery part of the lesson to<lb/> understand the content provided, as well as to provide the teacher with practical support by preparing or<lb/> distributing materials; and (iii) to support one group during group activities, by showing them how to solve<lb/> problems, or questioning and encouraging the group, while the teacher would be moving to support the<lb/> other groups.<lb/> The authors used a quasi-experimental design to examine the extent to which the use of NSAs was<lb/> effective in improving the achievement of low achievers at key stage 1. Low achieving children who had<lb/> received support were compared to those who had not, based on their score on a standardised mathematics<lb/> test 4 and controlling for a range of characteristics such as gender, social disadvantage (using free meal<lb/> eligibility as a proxy), special educational needs status and ethnicity. At the end of the school year,<lb/> students were re-tested using the same mathematics test. In addition, measures of whether or not the<lb/> student had received support from the NSA and the exact amount of time she/he had spent supporting the<lb/> student 5 were also collected. Finally, a multilevel modelling 6 was used to analyse the impact of the support<lb/> received, and teacher and school effectiveness were controlled for.<lb/> The results of the study do not provide much support for the use of learning support staff to improve<lb/> the achievement of low-performing students. Overall, no effect of being supported by a numeracy support<lb/> assistant was found. Likewise, adding the amount of time spent with the NSA did not have any significant<lb/> effect on progress in mathematics. However, there were some shortcomings to the study, for example: in<lb/> the comparison group, both students from ethnic minorities and with English as a second language were<lb/> over-represented, and although training and support were provided to NSAs during the programmes, these<lb/> might had not addressed their needs adequately, and no information about training quality was provided.<lb/> Furthermore, using eligibility for free meals as a proxy to measure social disadvantage can be argued to be<lb/> insufficient in measuring students&apos; socioeconomic status. Therefore, the two groups could possibly differ<lb/> in terms of social backgrounds in ways that could not be captured by the existing measures.<lb/> achievers in mathematics, the programme attempted to provide both training and an enhanced role for<lb/> learning support staff.<lb/> 4 The test used was originally designed by the University of Leeds and contained an oral (&apos;mental maths&apos;) and a<lb/> written part. The written part consisted of open-ended questions, and students were required to show their<lb/> workings (which were marked).<lb/> 5 NSA were required to fill in a form after every maths lesson with the names of the students they had worked with,<lb/> what subjects had been covered and how long they had worked with them.<lb/> 6 Multilevel modelling is a technique used when the sample is clustered (in this case, in classrooms). It also allows to<lb/> look at how much of the differences in achievement between students can be explained by their individual<lb/> characteristics as opposed to classroom characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<p>The largest study of learning support staff so far conducted in the United Kingdom is the Deployment<lb/> and Impact of Support Staff (DISS) project (<ref type="biblio">Blatchford et al., 2012</ref>), which aimed to provide an accurate,<lb/> systematic and representative description of the types of support staff and their characteristics and<lb/> deployment in schools, and how these changed over time, and analysed the impact of support staff on<lb/> teachers, teaching and student learning, behaviour and academic progress (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.1). The project was<lb/> implemented between 2003 and 2009 and was divided into two strands: strand 1, which included three<lb/> biennial large scale national questionnaire surveys of schools, teachers and support staff; and strand 2,<lb/> which involved detailed analysis of the deployment and impact of support staff and qualitative analysis of<lb/> processes in schools connected to the deployment and impact of support staff. Given the large variety of<lb/> support staff roles in the United Kingdom (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.2), the DISS project developed a new classification<lb/> of support staff through the grouping of titles based on similarities in activities. Thus, a category was<lb/> created for TA equivalent titles, which includes Teaching Assistant, Higher Level Teaching Assistant,<lb/> Classroom Assistant, Learning Support Assistant (LSA), LSA for students with special educational needs<lb/> (SEN), Nursery nurse and Therapist. Nonetheless, Teaching Assistants make up nearly half of total school<lb/> support staff workforce (<ref type="biblio">DfE, 2010</ref>).<lb/> The study found that TAs spent over half of their working hours directly supporting and interacting<lb/> with students. TAs&apos; interactions with students were predominantly at group level in primary education and<lb/> at individual level in secondary education, while teachers were mainly dedicated to lead the whole class<lb/> and move around the classroom. In terms of TA practice, they found that TAs were more focused on<lb/> completing tasks (e.g. encouraging students to complete written tasks, supplying answers and correcting<lb/> errors), while teachers were more focused on learning and understanding (e.g. explaining concepts,<lb/> encouraging students to think and checking understanding).<lb/> To analyse the impact of TAs&apos; work on teachers, teaching and student learning, the DISS project used<lb/> a teacher survey (4 091 responses from individual teachers), and systematic observations of students across<lb/> 49 schools (more than 34 400 observations). To analyse the TA impact on student achievement, the main<lb/> student support survey was used, which measured the effects of TA support over a school year on students&apos;<lb/> Positive Approaches to Learning (PAL) (e.g. motivation, confidence) and academic progress. PAL<lb/> outcomes were based on teachers&apos; ratings on whether a student&apos;s PAL had improved, remained unchanged<lb/> or decreased. Academic progress outcomes were based on academic attainment at the start and at the end<lb/> of school year.<lb/> lack of time for teacher-TA communication is also part of the preparedness component and results in an<lb/> inadequate collaboration between teachers and TAs, with TAs often dedicating extra unpaid hours to plan<lb/> and reflect with teachers, or going into lessons unaware of the tasks that they will have to do. According to<lb/> the authors, &quot; TAs&apos; practice and the effects of the support they provide need to be seen in terms of the<lb/> decisions made about their deployment and preparedness, made by school leaders and teachers, which are<lb/> outside the control of TAs &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Webster et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast to the research above, recent studies have found that learning support staff can be effective<lb/> at improving attainment when used to support specific students in small groups or through structured<lb/> interventions. Two recent randomised controlled trials conducted in England by the Education Endowment<lb/> EDU/WKP(2015)14<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Foundation (EEF, 2014a, 2014b</ref>) found significant improvements in learning in literacy and numeracy due<lb/> to intervention programmes based on the use of learning support staff. The first trial was based on a<lb/> 10-week programme (Switch-on Reading) for Year 7 students struggling in literacy (first year of secondary<lb/> school). This randomised controlled experiment consisted of 20-minute one-to-one reading sessions with a<lb/> TA and involved 308 students across 19 schools from one local authority in England. The results indicate<lb/> that the programme made a noticeable positive impact, on average, between three and five additional<lb/> months&apos; progress. The study suggests that the intervention can be an effective strategy for struggling and<lb/> disadvantaged readers, with an estimated cost of GBP 627 per student. 7<lb/></p>

			<p>The second study evaluated Catch Up Numeracy, a programme of one-to-one maths support for<lb/> students aged 6 to 11 (Years 2-6 of primary school), consisting of two sessions per week with TAs. 8 The<lb/> randomised controlled experiment involved 324 students in 54 schools from England and Wales, and three<lb/> groups were compared: one which continued with normal lessons, one which participated in the<lb/> programme and another one in which one-to-one support, without Catch Up Numeracy, was provided. The<lb/> study suggests that both Catch Up Numeracy and one-to-one intervention were found to significantly<lb/> increase learning. The effect size suggests that, on average, students struggling with numeracy and<lb/> receiving one-to-one support would make four additional months of progress over the year compared to<lb/> students who did not receive any support. However, there was little evidence that the Catch Up Numeracy<lb/> approach (with an effect size of three months&apos; additional progress) provided additional gains above those<lb/> from one-to-one intervention.<lb/> Also, several randomised controlled trials conducted in Denmark indicate that learning support staff<lb/> made a positive impact on student learning. As mentioned in Section 3.1, during the period 2009-2012, as<lb/> part of the &quot; School Development &quot; project of the Ministry of Education, approximately 125 Danish schools,<lb/> from 38 different municipalities, were involved in 44 pilot programmes using learning support staff<lb/> (referred to as teaching assistants, TAs) – in comprehensive schools with the primary aim of improving the<lb/> academic achievement of low performers and disadvantaged students. The evaluation of the two-year<lb/> Danish trials (<ref type="biblio">Rambøll, 2011</ref>) was based on quantitative as well as qualitative data. Questionnaires were<lb/> distributed to school principals, teachers and TAs at the schools involved in the trials and time-series<lb/> studies with rating scales were carried out at the same schools to measure well-being as well as levels of<lb/> learning among the students. The Child Outcome Rating Scale 9 (CORS) was used to measure well-being<lb/> and learning among children. This measurement was combined with two derived instruments to form the<lb/> Learning Rating Scale 10 (LRS). The time-series studies were carried out in the form of a test at the schools<lb/> 7 Estimates are based on a school delivering the programme to 24 students and training four teaching assistants.<lb/> 8 It consists of two 15-minute sessions per week, delivered by TAs. The intervention separates numeracy into ten<lb/> elements, including counting verbally, counting objects, word problems and estimation. Students are<lb/> assessed on each component and instruction is targeted at those areas in which they require more need.<lb/> in the first year of the pilot programme, and three successive tests during the second year. Finally,<lb/> qualitative case studies with interviews and observations of TA practice were also conducted during the<lb/> two-year trial period in eight municipalities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The randomised experiments provided the participating schools with minimum requirements<lb/> regarding the recruitment and deployment of the teaching assistants. As a result, TAs used in schools<lb/> varied a great deal in their level of competencies (ranging from unskilled workers to trained social<lb/> educators and student teachers) and the way they were used. Regarding the TAs&apos; tasks, two main roles<lb/> were identified: (i) assist teachers in routine and practical tasks, thus enabling them to focus on teaching;<lb/> and (ii) improve interactions and relationships in school between students, students and teachers, and<lb/> families and schools (e.g. handling conflicts between students), in order to create the best possible<lb/> environment for learning.<lb/> The evaluation of the trials indicates a positive contribution of support staff to students&apos; well-being,<lb/> especially among the most disadvantaged students. The results suggest that disadvantaged students, who<lb/> tended to experience low levels of well-being in schools, were the ones who benefited the most from the<lb/> TAs&apos; work, with approximately 60% of the most disadvantaged students experiencing good levels of<lb/> well-being in the last measurement, compared to 1% in the first measurement. According to the evaluators,<lb/> this can be attributed to the fact that disadvantaged students were receiving the support they needed from<lb/> professionals that were working with them in different contexts and activities. On the other hand, and<lb/> probably due to some spill-over effects, in classrooms where well-being improved for disadvantaged<lb/> students, an improvement was registered in the learning environment for everyone in the classroom,<lb/> including the teacher. The TA&apos;s impact on students&apos; learning was not found to be strong, though.<lb/> Moreover, no evidence was found regarding the importance of the formal education of TAs. Practical<lb/> experience, personality and commitment seemed to be far more important. Finally, teachers&apos; responses to<lb/> the surveys suggested a positive impact of TAs&apos; work on teachers&apos; job satisfaction and overall teachers&apos;<lb/> work, primarily due to the fact that, thanks to the TAs&apos; support, they were able to focus more on teaching.<lb/> approximately USD 26 000 per class. In the teaching assistant approach, schools were required to deploy<lb/> teaching assistants for all Year 6 classes for at least 14.5 lessons of 45 minutes per week. Teaching<lb/> assistants were also required to attend preparation courses, and the schools received also the equivalent to<lb/> USD 26 600 per class. Finally, municipalities receiving the counsellor treatment were required to employ a<lb/> counsellor for a half-time position to work with all the Year 6 classes of the schools in the municipality,<lb/> attending each class for 2.5 hours per week, on average. The municipalities received the equivalent of<lb/> USD 3 700 per Grade 6 class. In addition, there was a requirement for participating schools and<lb/> municipalities to dedicate the additional staff to the following focus areas: Danish language, mathematics,<lb/> and students&apos; well-being and inclusion. However, it was left to schools and municipalities to decide how<lb/> these staff should be managed and deployed to best meet the purpose of the project.<lb/> For the analysis, an extensive data base was used, including results in annual national tests, surveys<lb/> (pre-and post-treatment) among practitioners (school principals, teachers and support staff) and<lb/> municipalities, implementation and monitoring questionnaires, case studies and existing data from<lb/> Statistics Denmark, which includes information regarding socio-economic status, training, years of<lb/> experience, etc. for all the students, parents and staff involved in the study, and therefore enables a link to<lb/> be made with the information gathered by the study.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data show that some of the additional staff were recruited from within the same school, but most<lb/> were hired from outside the school. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.3 shows that most of the teachers and counsellors had a<lb/> teaching degree (83% and 69%, respectively), and only 29% of teaching assistants had a degree in<lb/> education. Teaching assistants were a heterogeneous group, with 16% being university graduates, 9%<lb/> studying a teaching degree and 46% with other backgrounds including artisan, teaching assistant, social<lb/> worker or high school graduate. Nonetheless, most teaching assistants were either trained/experienced<lb/> educators or student teachers. As can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.3, counsellors were the most experienced staff,<lb/> with an average of 14 years of teaching experience prior to their then current job. They were followed by<lb/> teachers, with 6.5 years of experience on average. Finally, teaching assistants were the least experienced<lb/> staff, with only three years of teaching experience on average. 100% of counsellors had previous<lb/> experience as a teacher, while 86% of teachers and 46% of teaching assistants had teaching experience<lb/> prior to their then current job.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data indicate that in the co-teaching approach, the additional teacher was deployed to peer with<lb/> the main teacher, and primarily contributed by teaching the whole class or smaller groups. In some cases,<lb/> they worked with one or more students outside the class, and they also contributed to the classroom climate<lb/> by controlling students&apos; behaviour and helping to solve conflicts. Teaching assistants&apos; were used as a<lb/> support for teachers to cope with academically weaker students, or those with additional difficulties, and<lb/> their main task consisted in working with individual students or groups either inside or outside the main<lb/> class. They also undertook tasks such as classroom management and observation of students. To a lesser<lb/> extent, teaching assistants developed instructional tasks (e.g. instruction during teacher absence). Finally,<lb/> counsellors primarily developed an advising role in areas such as technical issues, interaction and<lb/> relationship aspects, and special education issues. The data show that most additional teachers and teaching<lb/> assistants participated in mathematics and/or Danish language lessons; with slightly more in Danish (three<lb/> hours per week, on average) than in maths (almost two hours). However, 17% of additional teachers and<lb/> 32% of teaching assistants reported that they had participated in neither mathematics nor Danish lessons.<lb/> This suggests that additional teachers were devoted to fewer subjects, while teaching assistants participated<lb/> in several subjects, depending on students&apos; needs. Finally, data from surveys and case studies indicate that<lb/> teachers were satisfied with the support received in all three approaches.<lb/> Overall, the results indicate that all three approaches (co-teaching, teaching assistants and counsellors)<lb/> had positive effects on student reading achievement, measured as their progression in annual national test<lb/> results in the Danish language. However, the three approaches affected student achievement in different<lb/> ways. The co-teaching approach and the teaching assistant approach had an average positive effect on<lb/> reading achievement of 6% and 10% of a standard deviation, respectively, yet the difference between the<lb/> two approaches was not significant. No significant effect of the counsellor on student reading achievement<lb/> was found. For mathematics achievement, no significant effect was found from any of the approaches.<lb/> When examining different groups of students, teaching assistants and additional teachers were found to<lb/> positively affect girls&apos; reading achievement, whereas only teaching assistants were found to have a positive<lb/> effect on boys&apos; reading achievement. Furthermore, the teaching assistant approach was found to have the<lb/> greatest positive impact on reading achievement among those children with less educated parents (both<lb/> parents with, at most, ten years of schooling 12 ). In this case, teaching assistants enhanced student<lb/> achievement by 23% of a standard deviation, thus offsetting about half of the achievement difference<lb/> observed between students whose parents have no more than ten years of schooling and those children of<lb/> parents with more than lower secondary education. This may be explained by the fact that teaching<lb/> assistants were mainly dedicated to supporting low-performing students. Finally, the use of support staff<lb/> had a positive impact on achievement in classes with students with special needs.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2. Expenditure on learning support staff and student achievement<lb/></head>

			<p>Recent research from England (<ref type="biblio">Brown and Harris, 2010</ref>) assessed the relationship between increases<lb/> in expenditure on learning support staff (teaching assistants, TAs) 13 and changes in student attainment.<lb/> Data were collected from 83 public secondary schools in <ref type="biblio">England</ref> 14 , including: school expenditure on staff<lb/> between 2005-2006 and 2008-2009; Full-time Equivalent 15 (FTE) numbers of staff and changes in them<lb/> 12 In Denmark, compulsory education lasts 10 years.<lb/> 13 Data was collected on teachers, teaching assistants, cover supervisors, librarians, technicians (e.g. ICT, Science,<lb/> Art, Music) and pastoral support staff (e.g. assistant house, behaviour support workers).<lb/> 14 It should be noted that the average attainment of the selected schools was substantially above the national average.<lb/> 15 Calculated as the total number of hours provided by staff divided by the standard number of hours required in a full<lb/> time contract (25 hours).<lb/> EDU/WKP(2015)14<lb/> between the same periods; and changes in student attainment 16 at Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16) over the same<lb/> period. No data were collected on the actual deployment of the staff.<lb/> Using regression analysis, the authors found a statistically significant relationship between increases<lb/> in expenditure on TAs between 2005 and 2008, and improved student attainment. For a 100% increase in<lb/> the expenditure on TAs, students attainment increased by 19%, explaining 3% of the variation between<lb/> schools (Rsq = .034). No significant relationship was found between increased expenditure on staff other<lb/> than TAs (including teachers) and improvements in student attainment. Moreover, the results indicated a<lb/> stronger and more reliable relationship between increases in the absolute number of TAs (FTE) between<lb/> 2005 and 2008, and student attainment, with an increase in attainment of 37% for a 100% increase in the<lb/> absolute number of TAs. Finally, the results showed a significant relationship between the total number of<lb/> TAs in the school in 2005 and in 2008 with improvements in attainment. In addition, the relationship was<lb/> stronger in 2008 than in 2005, which can be due to the increased density and proportion of TAs in schools,<lb/> and a more effective deployment of these staff. This suggests that the larger the number of TAs in a school,<lb/> the stronger the relationship with increased attainment. The authors also assessed the impact of higher level<lb/> teaching assistants (HLTAs) on attainment, comparing the number of registered HLTAs and the number<lb/> achieving HLTA status between 2005 and 2008 in each school, to increases in attainment over this period.<lb/> However, no significant relationship was found.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Overall, the authors suggest that increasing the absolute number of TAs in schools is more effective<lb/> than increasing the expenditure on any other staff. However, due to the lack of information on TAs&apos;<lb/> deployment, the mechanism through which TA numbers improve student attainment is unclear.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>In the last two decades, learning support staff have become an essential part of the education<lb/> workforce in many countries, and countries like the United Kingdom and the United States have almost<lb/> doubled the average ratio of support staff to achieve a ratio of 15.5 teacher aides and teaching/research<lb/> assistants per 1000 students.<lb/> The existing literature shows that teachers generally value the contribution that learning support staff<lb/> make to teaching and learning. Learning support staff have a complementary role in regard to the teaching<lb/> process, but also substitute teachers in a set of non-teaching and routine tasks, such as taking on routine<lb/> teaching-related tasks (e.g. lesson preparation) to reduce teachers&apos; workload and allow them to focus on<lb/> teaching. The literature also indicates that the work of these staff can reduce pressure on the teacher in<lb/> relation to classroom management by helping the teacher cope with student misbehaviour, thus creating a<lb/> more productive classroom atmosphere. Furthermore, learning support staff can pair with teachers during<lb/> class in a complementary way, potentially providing the most effective teaching in every different context.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several ways through which learning support staff can have a positive impact on student<lb/> attainment. With an additional professional in class, students receive more individual help and attention<lb/> from either the support staff or the teacher. Therefore, students&apos; learning needs are more likely to be met,<lb/> which is likely to lead to greater achievement. In addition, the use of learning support staff enables a more<lb/> flexible learning environment, and groups of different size and characteristics can be created to better<lb/> respond to students&apos; needs and grant increased engagement and inclusion of children in classroom<lb/> activities. The use of learning support staff in schools can also contribute to a greater inclusion of<lb/> immigrant students and parents. Furthermore, learning support staff can cover teachers in their absence,<lb/> taking responsibility for classroom instruction, and thus maintain a high intensity of instruction and avoid<lb/> interruptions. Finally, the use of learning support staff can be an effective strategy to reduce grade<lb/> repetition, which is a costly and ineffective approach to address learning difficulties.<lb/> Research provides mixed evidence of the effect of learning support staff on student learning. No<lb/> significant differences in student achievement were found by a large-scale study examining data from<lb/> Tennessee&apos;s Project STAR between classes with or without learning support staff. Similarly, an English<lb/> study analysing the effect of trained learning support staff to help students underachieving in mathematics<lb/> using a quasi-experimental design didn&apos;t provide support for the use of learning support staff to improve<lb/> the achievement of low-performing students. The Deployment and Impact of Support Staff (DISS) project,<lb/> conducted in the United Kingdom, which analysed the impact of learning support staff on teachers,<lb/> teaching and student learning, behaviour and academic progress, also found very little evidence that<lb/> learning support staff contribute to improving student approaches to learning, such as motivation,<lb/> confidence, independence or concentration, and also found that these staff could have a negative effect on<lb/> student academic progress.<lb/> However, there is also evidence that, depending on the approach, learning support staff&apos;s work can<lb/> have a positive impact on student learning. Their support is perceived by teachers to reduce stress and<lb/> workload and improve their job satisfaction. Teachers also report that learning support staff positively<lb/> contribute in terms of increased teaching and curriculum coverage, through providing specialist help and<lb/> reducing administrative tasks, and granting the teacher more time for planning classes. Also, recent<lb/> research suggests that when used to support specific students and/or through structured interventions,<lb/> learning support staff can be effective at improving student attainment. Approaches such as one-to-one<lb/> interventions directed towards struggling students in the United Kingdom have been shown to positively<lb/> affect student learning. Similarly, randomised controlled trials conducted in Denmark suggests that the use<lb/> of additional staff in classes, either in co-teaching settings or as support staff, benefits student learning and<lb/> well-being, especially for those students who have low levels of performance. Finally, a recent study from<lb/> the United Kingdom indicates that an increase in the absolute number of learning support staff in schools<lb/> improves student attainment, particularly among disadvantaged students, who tend to experience low<lb/> levels of well-being in schools and lower levels of attainment. Overall, these studies agree that learning<lb/> support staff can contribute to student learning and well-being through, among others, a better classroom<lb/> climate, individualised attention and increased overall teaching.<lb/> This literature review also noted the importance of implementation for the effective use of learning<lb/> support staff in schools. Learning support staff are often the professionals who support students with<lb/> difficulties and low levels of performance, and they are increasingly undertaking more and more<lb/> pedagogical responsibilities. In this context, training should provide these professionals with the adequate<lb/> skills and competences to be able to face these challenges effectively. In addition, the literature suggests<lb/> that this training should be based in team work approaches and integrated into classroom practice from an<lb/> early stage. If not managed effectively, the way learning support staff are used in schools can lead to<lb/> fragmented and inconsistent support. The school management should ensure a clear definition of<lb/> teachers/learning support staff&apos;s respective roles, and provide enough time for them to plan and prepare<lb/> classes and engage in reflection. The inclusion of learning support staff in the school&apos;s decision-making, as<lb/> well as in the delineation of teachers&apos; and learning support staff&apos;s roles, could be an effective strategy to<lb/> achieve this. In addition, learning support staff may not always have the desired positive effect if care is<lb/> not taken with the practices used, and their work can negatively affect their participation and engagement<lb/> in the class experience. Learning support should ensure the inclusion of all children in classroom practice,<lb/> combining a diversity of approaches and practices.<lb/></p>
