			<p>The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBoC) began to function exclusively as a central bank in 1984. Since<lb/> then, much progress has been made in improving the conduct of monetary policy. China&apos;s monetary policy<lb/> framework has gradually moved away from a planned administrative system resting on credit rationing to a<lb/> more market-based regime with money growth as the main intermediate target. As part of this transition,<lb/> interest rates have been liberalised, making them more responsive to market signals, and the tools of<lb/> monetary policy have been modernised. The banking sector has also undergone significant reform (see<lb/> Chapter 3 in <ref type="biblio">OECD, 2010</ref>) and the economy has become far more responsive to market-based policy<lb/> measures.<lb/> Officially, the objective of Chinese monetary policy is &quot; to maintain the stability of the value of the<lb/> currency and thereby promote economic growth &quot; . 2 It is not clear whether this refers to maintaining the<lb/> domestic purchasing power of the currency -i.e., the price level -or the exchange rate. In practice, the<lb/> State Council has also charged the PBoC with achieving price stability, employment growth, external<lb/> balance, and financial stability. 3 The PBoC is further responsible for promoting financial sector<lb/> liberalisation. The central bank is not independent and needs the permission of the State Council to change<lb/> policy settings.<lb/></p>

			<p>The 11 th Plan called for interest rate liberalisation and improvement in the transmission mechanism of<lb/> monetary policy. From this perspective, this paper evaluates China&apos;s monetary policy framework and<lb/> suggests ways in which it could be strengthened. It begins by reviewing the targets and instruments used<lb/> by the PBoC to influence money market conditions (Section 2). As outlined in Section 3, as a result of a<lb/> number of factors, including ongoing interest rate reform and a stronger banking sector, China&apos;s money<lb/> market is becoming more integrated with different market segments increasingly linked via arbitrage.

			<p>PBoC now has considerable control over short-term interest rates in the interbank market and increasing<lb/> leverage over longer-term rates through the term structure. Going forward, the monetary policy framework<lb/> needs to place less emphasis on quantity-based liquidity controls and more on interest rate changes. The<lb/> PBoC&apos;s benchmark commercial bank lending and deposit rates, which do not influence economic activity<lb/> and are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the conduct of monetary policy, ought to be progressively<lb/> phased out.<lb/> In Section 4, the paper goes on to review the effects of monetary policy on the real side of the<lb/> economy and presents evidence on the effects of interest rate changes on economic activity. In particular,<lb/> capital formation at the firm level is shown to be sensitive to changes in interest rates via the user cost of<lb/> capital. In addition, the results of estimating a Phillips curve for China, which are presented in Section 5,<lb/> show that changes in aggregate demand pressures influence inflation. This implies that the transmission<lb/> mechanism is effective in China and that monetary policy can enhance stability by playing a greater role as<lb/> a macroeconomic shock absorber. However, as discussed in Section 6, the current exchange rate regime<lb/> limits the policy options available to the PBoC and the effectiveness of monetary policy more generally<lb/> and prevents the value of the currency from moving to offset macro shocks. Finally, Section 7 argues the<lb/> case for allowing greater exchange rate flexibility and moving towards a flexible inflation objective as the<lb/> nominal anchor. This would permit monetary policy to make a greater contribution to macroeconomic<lb/> stability and reduce the costs and risks of sterilising foreign reserve inflows.<lb/></p>

			<head>The modus operandi of the PBoC<lb/></head>

			<p>China&apos;s monetary policy framework has evolved considerably since the mid-1980s. From 1984 until<lb/> 1997, the PBoC issued base money and implemented monetary policy under a system of central bank<lb/> lending and credit controls. The PBoC provided liquidity to state-owned banks, which then lent money to<lb/> state-owned enterprises (SOEs), often at negative real interest rates. Since the establishment of the<lb/> development banks in 1994, central bank lending has mainly been used to subsidise rural credit<lb/> cooperatives or rescue insolvent financial institutions and no longer as a means of influencing monetary<lb/> conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>More recently, money growth has replaced credit rationing as the main intermediate target of<lb/> monetary policy. The PBoC sets targets for the year-on-year growth rates of the money supply and bank<lb/> credit that are deemed to be consistent with its policy objectives. Over the course of the year, the PBoC<lb/> adjusts policy settings in line with developments in intermediate targets and other macroeconomic<lb/> variables. In practice, notwithstanding instability in the money multiplier and unpredictable liquidity<lb/> growth given the current exchange rate regime, the PBoC has been reasonably proficient at hitting its<lb/> money supply and bank credit targets (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In 2009, however, the full-year target for M2 growth was<lb/> reached by end-March as liquidity was dramatically increased in response to the global economic<lb/> recession. GDP growth targets have often been exceeded, particularly in recent years, whereas inflation<lb/> targets have been both over-and undershot.<lb/></p>

			<p>The PBoC has a number of instruments at its disposal to achieve its money supply and credit growth<lb/> targets. Open market operations (OMOs) and changes in the required reserves of the commercial banks<lb/> have become the predominant tools with which the PBoC influences base money and money market<lb/> conditions more generally. The PBoC conducts OMOs using repos and central bank bills. Periodic changes<lb/> in reserve requirements have also become an important tool, mainly used in recent years to sterilise foreign<lb/> reserve inflows.<lb/></p>

			<p>As well as using quantity-based tools to control liquidity, the PBoC controls a range of interest rates<lb/> in the economy to varying degrees. The PBoC sets benchmark interest rates for commercial bank lending<lb/> and deposits across a range of maturities. It also sets interest rates on refinancing credit extended to the<lb/> banking system, the rediscount rate, and rates paid on the required and excess reserves of the commercial<lb/> banks deposited at the central bank. The yields on PBoC bills, which are used in OMOs to sterilise foreign<lb/> currency inflows, are also under the influence of the central bank. In comparison to OMOs and required<lb/> reserves, policy interest rates play a secondary role in monetary policy implementation and the PBoC<lb/> changes them less frequently and typically by a smaller amount than central banks elsewhere<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Anderson, 2007</ref>).<lb/> As well as quantity-based and, to a lesser extent, price-based instruments, the PBoC still uses a form<lb/> of administrative guidance to influence bank lending. Since bank-specific credit ceilings were removed in<lb/> 1998, the PBoC has held monthly meetings with commercial banks to outline its concerns about credit<lb/> conditions across sectors. The practice has since become institutionalised with the PBoC publishing notices<lb/> aimed at curbing lending in particular sectors from time to time. The PBoC also regularly reports on its<lb/> &quot; window guidance &quot; in its Quarterly Monetary Policy Reports. Administrative guidance has been<lb/> instrumental in slowing credit growth during periods of rapid expansion, such as in the early 2000s, and<lb/> increasing it more recently in response to the global recession. According to <ref type="biblio">Geiger (2006)</ref>, window<lb/> guidance can be effective because the governor of the PBoC ranks above officials in charge of the<lb/> commercial banks in the Chinese political hierarchy.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial markets and interest rates<lb/></head>

			<p>The interbank market for bonds started operating in 1997 and has since developed quickly (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> As discussed in OECD (2010), the rapid growth in China&apos;s bond market has been facilitated by financial<lb/> sector liberalisation and the market infrastructure for borrowing and lending reserves among banks is now<lb/> well established. Although issued bonds have typically been short-term, bonds of longer maturities are<lb/> being increasingly offered and turnover and liquidity have grown rapidly.<lb/> For most of the past decade, relatively few government bonds have been issued and offerings by the<lb/> PBoC have dominated the market. Until 2004, the corporate paper market was undeveloped as a result of<lb/> restrictive regulations set by the National Development Reform Commission. Subsequently, the PBoC<lb/> opened a corporate commercial paper market and, from 2007, allowed medium-term corporate notes to be<lb/> traded in the same market. As a result, between end 2007 and end 2009, the outstanding stock of<lb/> commercial paper and bonds issued by the non-financial corporate sector and local governments more than<lb/> tripled. Net sales amounted to 4% of GDP in 2009. Local authorities and their corporate affiliates (used to<lb/> finance infrastructure projects) were particularly active, raising 1.2% of GDP in 2009. In the first three<lb/> quarters of 2010, borrowing by the non-financial sector and local governments eased back, but still<lb/> amounted to 2.6% of GDP, bringing the outstanding stock of debt to 9% of annual GDP. Despite this<lb/> recent progress, however, the outstanding stock of bonds is still relatively small both compared with other<lb/> countries and relative to the size of bank lending.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are a variety of different money markets in China. The market for uncollaterised loans, which<lb/> are traded between banks, is not large and around 90% of the short-term money market turnover takes<lb/> place in the repurchase market, using bonds as collateral. Within the repo market, loans are traded both on<lb/> the stock exchanges and between banks, with the latter market dominating. In the interbank repo market,<lb/> trading is dominated by the 7-day maturity, which accounts for nearly 80% of the total turnover. At longer<lb/> maturities, market depth is limited.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></figure>

			<p>Three types of interest rates are available in the short-term market:<lb/> i) the CHIBOR, which refers to a weighted average of actual transaction rates on the uncollateralised<lb/> interbank market;<lb/> ii) the SHIBOR, available since January 2007, which represents the daily average of the quotes of<lb/> 16 banks at 11.30 in the morning. This rate has the advantage of offering a price even when there are no<lb/> market transactions. Its disadvantage is that the banks are not obliged to trade at their quoted rates. The<lb/> objective of the SHIBOR was to generate a well-determined interest rate index that be used as the basis for<lb/> derivative products.<lb/> iii) In January 2008, an interest rate swap market was introduced using the SHIBOR as a base.<lb/> However, turnover in this market has remained very limited and by September 2010 transactions in the<lb/> interbank swap market were only 1.4% of the transactions in the cash and secured interbank bank market.<lb/> The flows in the interbank market are not the result of random fluctuations in the liquidity of a large<lb/> number of institutions but rather stem from the major four banks, accounting for over 70% of deposits,<lb/> having a structural surplus of deposits and consistently supplying money to the interbank market where it<lb/> is lent to other financial institutions. The relative importance of the different borrowers in the market varies<lb/> from year to year. The depth of the market is restricted by regulations limiting foreign banks to borrowing<lb/> only 1.5 times their capital in the interbank market.<lb/> Market interest rates, including interbank rates, bill discounting rates and bond yields are fully<lb/> liberalised and move flexibly to clear markets for borrowing and lending reserves. 4 However in the<lb/> corporate bill market, introduced in 2005 by the Central Bank, an association of underwriters the National<lb/> Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors -sets the minimum rate at which new issues can be<lb/> made. Sometimes this rate deviates from the rate in the secondary market, effectively closing the new<lb/> issues market.<lb/></p>

			<head>The influence of the PBoC on the interbank market<lb/></head>

			<p>In April 2003, the PBoC converted all existing repurchase agreements into Central Bank bills to<lb/> create a new instrument for intervening in money markets. Since then, a relatively deep and liquid market<lb/> has developed. The central bank uses PBoC bills of various maturities to conduct open market operations<lb/> (OMOs) aimed at achieving its liquidity targets. In 2004, the PBoC introduced a range of innovations to<lb/> improve the effectiveness of its OMOs, including the introduction of a one and three-year tenors. In<lb/> addition, the PBoC increased the frequency of its OMOs auctions, extended the length of the trading period<lb/> and linked the bill trading system with the payment system so that settlement can be done on a payment-<lb/>on-delivery basis. Consistent with the PBoC&apos;s reliance on quantity-based measures for implementing<lb/> monetary policy, bill auctions are usually conducted as fixed-quantity tenders with a variable interest rate,<lb/> although fixed-interest-rate auctions have been used as well from time to time. There is also an active repo<lb/> market that the PBoC can use to manage the supply of reserves, although in practice it has not used it<lb/> much.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> The Third Plenary Session</head>

			<table>of the 14 th Communist Party Central Committee set out the broad direction of<lb/> interest rate liberalisation in November 1993. In 2002, the 16 th National Congress reiterated the call for<lb/> interest rate reform with the aim of improving the efficiency with which financial resources are allocated.<lb/> In 2003, the Third Plenary Session of the 16 th Central Committee called for market-determined interest<lb/> rates steered by the PBoC consistent with economic objectives.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></table>

			<p>The PBoC has considerable leverage over short-term money market interest rates. By setting the<lb/> interest rate it pays on excess reserves, the PBoC effectively imposes a floor in the interbank market. In<lb/> principle, the PBoC&apos;s base or benchmark rate, at which it lends to banks and other financial institutions,<lb/> should impose a ceiling. In practice, however, the PBoC does not issue loans at this rate and there has been<lb/> no lending through the base lending window since 2001. As a result, money market rates occasionally<lb/> spike above the base lending rate when liquidity is short, notably when there have been large IPOs in the<lb/> stock market. Until the onset of the global financial crisis, the PBoC had progressively increased the spread<lb/> between the interest rate on excess reserves and base lending to encourage banks to trade amongst<lb/> themselves in the interbank market (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The market interest rates under the control of the PBoC have started to have a stronger influence on<lb/> rates in the interbank market. Both rolling correlations and regressions with time-varying coefficients<lb/> (Box 1) indicate that the pass-through of changes in three-month PBoC bill rates to interbank repo rates of<lb/> the same maturity has increased over recent years (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The strong influence of the PBoC bill rate on<lb/> the repo rate (both with three month maturities) is also confirmed by regression of the repo rate on the<lb/> PBoC bill rate and the lagged repo rate (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Although these correlations are not as strong as in OECD<lb/> countries, where central banks stand ready to lend or borrow at the policy interest rate, PBoC control over<lb/> interbank interest rates is becoming increasingly significant. However, the repo rate is much more volatile<lb/> than the PBoC bill rate, which may reflect the quantity oriented operating structure of monetary policy that<lb/> results in interest rate spikes in response to large IPOs (<ref type="biblio">Porter and Xu, 2009</ref>). There is some evidence, in<lb/> line with the rolling correlations, that the response of the repo rate to the PBC bill rate has become stronger<lb/> since 2005 but the variability of the repo rate remains much greater than that of the PBoC bill rate.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 1. Regressions with time-variant coefficients<lb/> Following <ref type="biblio">Cournède et al. (2008)</ref>, regressions with time-varying coefficients are used to look at how the<lb/> response of interest rates on one financial asset to interest rates on a different assets has evolved over time.<lb/> Specifically, the analysis underpinning the time-varying coefficients graphed in Figures 3(c, d) and 4 respectively<lb/> looks at the response of:<lb/> • Repo rates in the interbank market to PBoC bill rates at three and 12-month maturities.<lb/> • 10-year Treasury bond rates to movements in the three-mouth interbank repo rate.<lb/> For ease of exposition, the following description of this technique is based on the latter – i.e. the response<lb/> of long rates to short rates. The technique is exactly analogous for the former.

			<p>A significant reduction in the amount of excess reserves held by the banking sector is one important<lb/> reason why China&apos;s money market has become more sensitive to the actions of the PBoC and different<lb/> market segments have become more integrated. In early 2002, excess reserves accounted for almost 8% of<lb/> bank deposits, more than doubling the size of bank reserves deposited at the PBoC (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). By the start<lb/> of 2009, excess reserves had fallen to under 2.5%. Hence, smaller banks are now more likely to need to<lb/> borrow in the money market to cover their requirements at the central bank and are therefore more<lb/> sensitive to money market rates. For larger banks that supply funds to the market, the channel for<lb/> influencing inter-bank rates is different in that they can always elect not to roll over their lending to raise<lb/> reserves during time of relatively scarce liquidity.<lb/> Notwithstanding recent falls, excess reserves in the Chinese banking system are still high compared to<lb/> those found in other countries historically. For instance, in the decade prior to September 2007, excess<lb/> reserves in the United States were only 4% of the amount of required reserves, since excess reserves were<lb/> not remunerated. 5 There are a number of reasons for high reserve levels in China. In part, they arise in<lb/> response to the method used to calculate a bank&apos;s required reserves. Specifically, banks are penalised if<lb/> their reserves at the end of each business day fall below the required level, which is set equal to average<lb/> deposits at the end of the last ten day accounting period multiplied by the required reserve ratio. In Japan<lb/> and the euro area, banks are allowed to hold reserves below the required level on a given day provided the<lb/> monthly average level of reserves meets the target. In the United States the averaging period is two weeks.<lb/> Thus, the reserve requirement in China is not a period average requirement. Also, as discussed below, high<lb/> liquidity in the banking system is an inevitable consequence of the current exchange rate regime coupled<lb/> with generally large capital inflows. In addition, the relatively small size of China&apos;s bond market means<lb/> that banks have only limited options for investing their large deposit base. Finally, the interest rate paid by<lb/> the PBoC on excess reserves effectively lowers their opportunity cost.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Three years later, however, following massive open market operations and the fall in the demand for credit,<lb/> banks held total reserves that were 14 times greater than their required reserves. Moreover, since<lb/> September 2008 excess reserves have been remunerated.<lb/></p>

			<p>One important disadvantage of the PBoC&apos;s quantity-based approach is that day-to-day changes in<lb/> money supply and demand translate into high-frequency interest rate volatility. In part, this volatility<lb/> reflects the need for Chinese banks to meet required reserve targets on a daily basis. As a result, realised<lb/> interest rate volatility in the interbank market is typically higher in China than in countries with an<lb/> implementation framework based around an overnight policy interest rate and longer reserve assessment<lb/> periods (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Moving to a policy interest rate framework and a longer reserve reference period would<lb/> help reduce high-frequency interest rate volatility. This approach would also enable the system to handle<lb/> shocks better and allow changes in policy settings to be communicated to the public more effectively.<lb/></p>

			<head>The response of bank lending to money-market conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>While there is growing evidence that the PBoC influences market interest rates through open market<lb/> operations, the main communication channel for its interest rate policy is through changes in regulated<lb/> bank deposit and lending rates. The PBoC progressively widened the margin between benchmark lending<lb/> and deposit rates from zero at the beginning of the 1990s to 350 basis points at the beginning of this<lb/> century. This restored the profitability of the banking sector and ended the period during which banks were<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> seen as a channel for distributing savings, rather than entities that needed to earn a rate of return on their<lb/> own capital.<lb/> Since 2002, the PBoC has set the regulated lending rate in line with the repo rate, except in relatively<lb/> low growth periods (such as 2005 and 2009) when repo rates have fallen to low levels (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). In these<lb/> periods, the PBoC has not allowed the regulated lending rate or the deposit rate to fall in line with market<lb/> rates. In the 2006 and 2007 upturn the PBoC did increase savings rates more quickly than in the 2003<lb/> upswing. In the 2009 downturn, however, there was no change in the policy of holding regulated rates<lb/> above market rates. With the growth of the commercial paper market, such behaviour is becoming<lb/> increasingly difficult to manage. This was evident in the first half of 2009 when the issuance of<lb/> commercial paper surged as companies changed the origin of their borrowing towards the commercial<lb/> paper market where interest rates were lower than in the banking system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Until 2004, the interest rates set by the commercial banks were not permitted to deviate from the<lb/> benchmark rates by more than 10%. Since then, the bands of permissible interest rates around the<lb/> benchmark rates have been progressively widened and commercial bank lending rates are now only subject<lb/> to a floor, and deposit rates to a ceiling (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). 6 In theory, this has increased the extent to which<lb/> commercial banks are free to set interest rates. In practice, after an initial spike, the average margin over<lb/> the regulated rate has remained low and fell to only 60 basis points in the first half of 2009. In effect, the<lb/> degree of deregulation has been limited, with banks either reluctant to price loans according their degree of<lb/> risk, or, alternatively, failing to grant credit to higher–risk, smaller companies. In addition, the ceiling on<lb/> deposit rates also still appears to be binding, with effective deposit rates clustered around the benchmark<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Porter and Xu, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Money markets are one of the key links between a country&apos;s financial system and its real economy.<lb/> For that link to work, banks must be able to absorb and pass on changes in the cost of funds in the money<lb/> market to bank clients and vary rates in line with their credit-worthiness. This point is especially salient in<lb/> China. Notwithstanding the recent increase in the size of the corporate paper market, bank lending is still<lb/> by far the largest source of outside financing for investment. For example, Liu and Zhang (2007) report<lb/> that the banking sector intermediates about 75% of financial capital in China, implying that bank lending<lb/> rates, to a large extent, determine the marginal cost of capital for the entire economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>With commercial banks increasingly profit-oriented and relying more on the money market as a<lb/> source of funding and the central bank adjusting regulated rates more in line with market rates, the<lb/> relationship between the effective commercial bank lending rate and money market rates is strong. For<lb/> example, since 2004 when data on the effective rate charged on bank lending became available, the<lb/> correlation between the effective one-year bank lending rate and the three-month interbank repo rate has<lb/> been 0.77, significant at the 99% level of confidence. In a simple regression, the coefficient on the three<lb/> month interbank rate (averaged over a 12-month period) indicates an almost exact pass-through to effective<lb/> one year lending rates (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). 8 Thus, there is now a clear relationship between interest rates on<lb/> short-term PBoC bills, money market rates and both the effective and regulated bank lending rates. As<lb/> such, the interest rate on short-term bills has now become a key signalling rate for Chinese monetary<lb/> policy.<lb/> 8 .<lb/> It is not possible to compare the one year bank lending rate to the one year repo rate, as in many periods<lb/> there were no transactions in the one-year market.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important consideration for the effective transmission of monetary policy is the extent to<lb/> which interest rate changes at the short end of the yield curve influence the long end. Policymakers<lb/> typically influence short rates, but spending and consequently inflation are usually related to interest rates<lb/> at longer maturities. The stronger the relationship between short and long interest rates, the more leverage<lb/> the central bank has along the yield curve, thereby increasing the likelihood of real activity correlating with<lb/> changes in monetary policy. In OECD countries, this relationship has changed over the past few decades,<lb/> reflecting the relative importance of, inter alia, inflation expectations as a driver of bond yields (<ref type="biblio">Cournède<lb/> et al., 2008</ref>). In China, the impact of quarterly changes in 90-day interest rates on 10-year bond yields has<lb/> increased since 2005 and is currently broadly comparable to that in a number of OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 8</ref>). This methodology suggests that the pass-through coefficient of short-term rates on long-term rates had<lb/> risen to around 0.2 until the beginning of 2008 (similar to that found in major OECD countries). However,<lb/> this point estimate was not well defined and had a large standard error.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since 2008, the rolling coefficient analysis suggests that the relationship between short-term and long-<lb/>term rates has broken down. Longer-term yields are affected not just by current short-term interest rates but<lb/> also expectations about future short-term interest rates and hence the future movement of the economy and<lb/> inflation. As yet, there is insufficient information to use the slope of the yield curve in China as an<lb/> indicator of future economic growth in the same way it is often used in advanced economies (<ref type="biblio">Estrella,<lb/> 2005</ref>). However, a similar relationship does appear to be evolving in China, with the yield curve becoming<lb/> markedly steeper during the period of rapid monetary expansion in the spring of 2009 (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). By the<lb/> autumn of 2009, its gradient reached unprecedented levels, before starting to fall back as the stance of<lb/> monetary policy became more normal.<lb/></p>

			<head>The way forward for interest rate reform<lb/></head>

			<p>China&apos;s monetary policy implementation framework needs to evolve to keep pace with a rapidly-<lb/>changing economy or risks losing its effectiveness. Targeting money growth with quantity-based<lb/> instruments has been a natural evolution for Chinese monetary policy from the era of credit rationing. In<lb/> addition, the PBoC&apos;s substantial sterilisation operations, which, as discussed below, are necessary to<lb/> absorb large capital inflows under an inflexible exchange rate regime, also predispose the PBoC towards a<lb/> quantity-based approach to liquidity management. Although quantity-based frameworks have an important<lb/> role to play in countries with shallow and under-developed financial markets, interest rates are a key<lb/> macroeconomic price in more advanced economies and ensuring that they operate freely and transmit<lb/> changes in monetary policy is a crucial prerequisite for an efficient allocation of capital. Making more use<lb/> of policy interest rates would also reduce the PBoC&apos;s reliance on changes in required reserves as a means<lb/> of controlling liquidity, which have been found to hamper financial market development (IMF, 2004). In<lb/> addition, changes in required reserves and quantitative monetary tools in general risk becoming less<lb/> effective as other forms of financial intermediation outside the banking system become more important, as<lb/> has been recently happening in China.<lb/> Moving to a policy interest rate would also lessen the PBoC&apos;s reliance on &quot; window guidance &quot; to<lb/> commercial banks, which weakens competition and undermines the market determination of interest rates.<lb/> The impact of window guidance on bank behaviour is also unpredictable and asymmetric, with those banks<lb/> following the wishes of the PBoC in times of tightening suffering commercial disadvantage. In addition,<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> over the course of the global financial crisis, less reliance on window guidance and more reliance on policy<lb/> interest rates would have given the PBoC better information on the extent of its tightening in the first part<lb/> of 2008 and helped minimise the lending surge when lending quotas were abolished at the end of 2009.<lb/> Such surges in lending are not uncommon after periods during which credit growth has been constrained<lb/> by lending targets.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Another important difficulty with using quantity-based tools to implement monetary policy arises<lb/> because China&apos;s state-controlled companies still have preferential access to bank finance. As such, a<lb/> reduction in credit growth, for example, typically falls disproportionately on private-sector firms, which, as<lb/> a group, have been the most productive in China (see Chapter 4 in OECD, 2010). In contrast, an interest<lb/> rate hike in a price-based framework is more likely to induce firms to suspend investment projects for<lb/> which the expected stream of future profits is marginal or highly uncertain, without the need for bank<lb/> officials to make such judgements. Conversely, an interest rate cut will tend to stimulate investment<lb/> projects with the highest expected rates of return, whereas mandated increases in bank credit, which have<lb/> played a large role in the PBoC&apos;s response to the global recession, imply a greater risk of non-performing<lb/> loans impairing bank balance sheets in the future.<lb/></p>

			<p>As well as moving to a price-based implementation framework, interest rate reform in other areas of<lb/> China&apos;s financial markets also needs to proceed. To continue reducing excess reserves in the banking<lb/> system and improving the degree of central bank control over money market conditions, the interest rate on<lb/> excess reserves deposited at the central bank needs to be set significantly below the other central bank rates<lb/> so as to lower the risk of the money market ceasing to function. 9 On the other hand, the interest rate paid<lb/> on required reserves should be set more in line with market rates. As discussed below, this would lower the<lb/> share of foreign reserve sterilisation costs that is currently borne by the commercial banks.<lb/> Some aspects of China&apos;s current interest rate framework also hinder competition in the banking<lb/> sector. With commercial bank interest rates increasingly linked to money market conditions, the primary<lb/> purpose of the PBoC&apos;s lending rate floor and deposit rate ceiling has been to safeguard the profitability of<lb/> the predominantly state-owned banking sector. However, the weight given to protecting bank profit<lb/> margins appears to have fallen over time. By 2008, the net interest margin of Chinese banks had dropped<lb/> below those of banks in the United States and other Asian countries and it fell further in 2009, as lending<lb/> expanded rapidly (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Models of oligopolistic markets suggest that while deregulation of the borrowing and lending rates is<lb/> only likely to make a slight change to bank borrowing and lending rates, it would a make a much greater<lb/> difference to the distribution of deposits across banks, allowing smaller banks to grow significantly<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Feyzioglu et al., 2009</ref>). Deregulation should also encourage a greater pass-through of money market rates<lb/> to bank interest rates, though the results cited above suggest that the pass-through has already risen to a<lb/> level similar to that indicated by a model of a deregulated oligopolistic banking sector. As the money<lb/> market now provides banks with an interest rate benchmark, there is no longer a need for the PBoC to do<lb/> so. Accordingly, the benchmark lending and deposit rates ought to be progressively phased out. Concerns<lb/> about bank profitability should be addressed by fiscal and prudential policy, rather than interest rate<lb/> regulation.<lb/> As underlined in OECD (2010), corporate bond market regulation is also in need of further reform.<lb/> Restrictions in this market protect banks&apos; large corporate lending business. If this market were better<lb/> developed so that the issuing rates of corporate bonds were fully market-determined, competitive pressures<lb/> on banks would intensify. As a result, bank borrowing costs for firms would better reflect market<lb/> conditions, which, in turn, are affected by the PBoC. In essence, greater reliance on market prices in the<lb/> valuation of corporate assets would work to reinforce the balance sheet channel of monetary policy.<lb/> A key issue for China in moving to a price-based implementation framework is the resilience of the<lb/> banking sector to interest rates changes. As discussed in OECD (2010), reform in this area has moved a<lb/> long way over recent years and the banking sector is now in significantly better health than in the recent<lb/> past. Ultimately, in conjunction with the framework changes discussed below, moving to a policy interest<lb/> rate would facilitate the modernisation of the financial system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Declared non-performing loans had been successfully reduced to low levels by 2008 and have<lb/> remained at this low level, while being fully provisioned. The key to further improving the robustness of<lb/> the banking sector is to transform it into a well-supervised system that effectively allocates credit to its<lb/> most efficient use given prevailing market interest rates. Indeed, the response of the banking system to the<lb/> fiscal stimulus has illustrated that the process of credit allocation could still be improved. In response to<lb/> demand from local authorities and their development corporations, borrowing by local development<lb/> corporations rose by CNY 3 trillion in 2009, bringing the debt of these vehicles to CNY 7.3 trillion (nearly<lb/> 22% of GDP). The scale of their borrowing was reduced in the first half of 2010, with their bank and<lb/> capital market borrowing rising by 0.8% and 0.7% of GDP respectively. Overall, the borrowing of local<lb/> financing platforms amounted to almost one-fifth of total outstanding bank loans in June 2010. This was in<lb/> addition to their borrowing of CNY 0.7 trillion in capital markets in 2009 and 2010. According to the bank<lb/> regulator almost one quarter of the bank loans to development corporations have been to projects of<lb/> doubtful financial viability and hence pose the risk of becoming non-performing in future years.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the strains placed on China&apos;s financial system by the current exchange rate regime, further<lb/> interest rate reform needs to be carried out as part of a package that includes changes in currency market<lb/> arrangements, as outlined below.<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact of interest rate changes on the real economy<lb/></head>

			<p>The transmission of monetary policy to the real side of the economy requires that components of<lb/> aggregate demand be sensitive to changes in financial conditions. A great deal of research in this area has<lb/> focused on understanding the impact of interest rate changes on investment, which accounts for a<lb/> particularly large share of GDP and growth in China and is an important driver of business cycle<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> volatility. 10 In principle, firms adjust their capital stock so that its marginal productivity equals its user<lb/> cost. As interest rates increase, for example, firms scale back projects for which the expected return is<lb/> insufficient to cover the higher financing costs, and investment slows. In addition to this direct interest rate<lb/> channel, higher interest rates may also reduce firm cash-flow which, in the absence of perfect capital<lb/> markets, will reduce their spending (credit channel).<lb/></p>

			<head>Monetary policy transmission is difficult to see at the macro level<lb/></head>

			<p>The macro-based evidence of a significant negative relationship between interest rate changes and<lb/> capital formation in China is not particularly compelling. For example, <ref type="biblio">Geiger (2006)</ref> argues that changes<lb/> in interest rates have had a limited impact on aggregate macroeconomic variables and that the transmission<lb/> of monetary policy via the interest rate channel is distorted. In a VAR-based analysis, Laurens and Maino<lb/> (2007) also find that changes in short-term interest rates have had a minimal and statistically insignificant<lb/> impact on GDP. In another VAR study, Koivu (2008) reports that the transmission of interest rate changes<lb/> to the real economy is weak over the sample period 1998 to mid-2007. <ref type="biblio">Qin et al. (2005)</ref> paradoxically find<lb/> that a rise in interest rates leads to an increase in investment, with a lag of about one year.<lb/> In contrast, other authors have found evidence of a link between interest rates and macro aggregates.<lb/> For example, Girardin and Liu (2006), using a VAR model estimated on monthly data over 1997-2005,<lb/> find that short-term interest rates do have a significant impact on output and inflation, particularly in the<lb/> latter part of the sample period. <ref type="biblio">He et al. (2005)</ref> finds that business investment in China is responsive to<lb/> price signals in both the short and the long run.<lb/> It is difficult to estimate a stable IS equation for China, though some equations suggest that both<lb/> interest rates and the exchange rate have a statistically significant impact on the economy, even if the<lb/> absolute value of this impact is small. Specifically, the following equation is estimated on quarterly data<lb/> over the period 2000-07:<lb/></p>

			<p>where Y is real output, r the real benchmark PBoC lending rate, z a real effective exchange rate index for<lb/> the renminbi and ε an i.i.d. error term. The variable z is defined so that when the currency appreciates the<lb/> value of the index increases. It is initially estimated with the full complement of right-hand-side variables<lb/> and then without the insignificant lags. The results are reported in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Changes in the real interest rate<lb/> are estimated to have had a statistically significant impact on GDP growth during the estimation period that<lb/> runs from 2000 to 2007. The economic scale of the impact is, however, extremely small. Moreover, this<lb/> result is not particularly robust to alternative model specifications or changes in sample period. Changes in<lb/> the real effective exchange rate also have the expected sign and are statistically significant to varying<lb/> degrees.<lb/> 10.<lb/> In China, gross fixed capital formation has grown by almost 20% per annum over recent years and<lb/> currently accounts for around 40% of GDP. Accordingly, understanding the linkages between financial<lb/> conditions and investment is of key importance when assessing monetary policy&apos;s macroeconomic<lb/> stabilisation role.<lb/></p>

			<p>The most common and obvious explanation for the limited impact of interest rate changes on the<lb/> Chinese macro economy is that state-owned commercial banks are often obliged to lend to SOEs (many of<lb/> which are owned by local authorities and are engaged in infrastructure activities) that enjoy soft budget<lb/> constraints, may have their debts forgiven and are therefore insensitive to changes in the price of credit.<lb/> However, studies of monetary policy transmission in OECD countries also generally have difficulty<lb/> finding clear evidence of a significant link between interest rate changes and investment at the<lb/> macroeconomic level. This difficulty is often ascribed to simultaneity biases – investment moves<lb/> pro-cyclically with the business cycle, which, in turn, is positively correlated with interest rates. 11<lb/></p>

			<head>Micro-level studies are more revealing<lb/></head>

			<p>In contrast to studies conducted at the aggregate level, micro-level approaches aimed at understanding<lb/> the linkages between capital formation and its user cost have been more fruitful in OECD countries. For<lb/> example, the impact of changes in monetary policy on investment at the firm level has been investigated<lb/> using micro data in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This work provides compelling evidence of an<lb/> interest rate channel operating through the user cost of capital. In addition, it also uncovers a significant<lb/> credit channel whereby firms with weaker balance sheets display a higher sensitivity of investment<lb/> spending to cash flow.</p>

			<table>12<lb/> 11.<lb/> See, for example, Bernanke and Gertler (1995), Chirinko (1993) and Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2007). Other<lb/> potential sources of biases include misspecification of dynamics in investment equations, transitory time-<lb/>series variation in the data and positively-sloped supply schedules which bias the estimated user cost<lb/> elasticity towards zero (Chirinko et al., 2004).<lb/> 12.<lb/> See the overview by Chatelin et al. (2003) and the country-specific papers referenced therein. Other studies<lb/> based on micro data that reach similar conclusions for other countries include Gilchrist and Zakrajsek<lb/> (2007) for the United States and Nagahata and Sekine (2005) for Japan.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></table>

			<p>In the case of China, there are reasons to think that economic reforms over recent years would have<lb/> increased the elasticity of capital formation to its user cost. Since the 1980s, the Chinese Government has<lb/> been progressively separating government functions from business operations across sectors, including<lb/> banking. SOEs are now held more accountable for their successes and failures and access to finance at<lb/> interest rates that are (implicitly or explicitly) below market levels has become much more limited. At the<lb/> same time, the rapid development of the private sector should also increase the sensitivity of aggregate<lb/> investment to the user cost of capital. Listed Chinese firms have been relying more on debt funding over<lb/> recent years, which should also heighten their sensitivity to interest rate changes (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>To assess the impact of interest rate changes at the micro level, a model of investment by Chinese<lb/> firms is estimated. To the authors&apos; knowledge, this is the first model of investment at the firm level in<lb/> China to include the impact of the user cost of capital on firms&apos; investment decisions. 13 The model follows<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Chatelain et al. (2003)</ref> and estimates the following equation at the micro level:<lb/></p>

			<p>In this model, the user cost of capital is the key price term. The benchmark measure of the user cost is<lb/> calculated as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>As a robustness check, the cost of debt financing (i s,t ) is measured in three different ways in four<lb/> alternative user cost measures:<lb/> •<lb/> UC1: In the benchmark version of the model debt financing costs are measured as an &quot; apparent<lb/> interest rate &quot; , calculated as finance expenses over total firm debt. Reflecting data availability,<lb/> finance expenses are calculated using net finance costs less cash received from investment<lb/> income at the firm level. This variable is highly correlated with total firm debt, implying that it<lb/> predominantly reflects debt servicing costs. This is firm-level data and introduces firm-specific<lb/> variation into this measure of debt financing costs.<lb/> •<lb/> UC2: Debt financing costs are measured at the macro level as the 1-year benchmark interest rate<lb/> for commercial bank lending, set by the PBoC.<lb/> •<lb/> UC3: Debt financing costs are measured as the 1-year effective bank lending interest rate, which<lb/> is an average of interest rates actually paid on commercial banks loans as surveyed by the PBoC<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> above).<lb/> •<lb/> UC4: Debt financing costs are based on the &quot; apparent interest rate &quot; as in UC1, but the debt and<lb/> equity rate are weighted by the changes in the debt and equity share of total liabilities for each<lb/> firm in each year. The advantage of these &quot; flow &quot; weights is that they reflect the ongoing financial<lb/> decisions of the firm. The disadvantage is that they are not directly linked to a well-</p>

			<table>defined<lb/> marginal decision (von Kalckreuth, 2001).<lb/> The micro data used in the model covers listed Chinese firms at the annual frequency over the period<lb/> 2002 to 2007. Descriptive statistics of the variables are given in Table 6. With the exception of changes in<lb/> user cost, the distributions of all the other variables are positively skewed. The within-firm standard<lb/> deviation, which measures the variability of each variable across time abstracting from variation across<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> firms, is relatively high for cash flow over capital (<lb/> 1<lb/> ,<lb/> ,<lb/> −<lb/> t<lb/> s<lb/> t<lb/> s<lb/> K<lb/> cf ), whereas the investment to capital ratio<lb/></table>

			<p>) has been relatively less volatile. Finally, a comparatively large share of the volatility in all of the<lb/> changes in user cost variables (UC1 to UC4) can be explained by aggregate time effects and is therefore<lb/> common across firms, particularly user cost estimated using commercial bank lending rates at the macro<lb/> level. In contrast, most of the variability in the other variables in the model is firm-specific.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all versions of the model, the long-run impact of sales growth on changes in the capital stock is<lb/> broadly similar at around 0.2, indicating that investment responds positively to increases in firm output, as<lb/> proxied by real sales growth.<lb/> The estimated impact of changes in the user cost of capital on investment varies across models. In the<lb/> benchmark model, the user cost, which is calculated using the apparent interest rate at the firm level<lb/> (UC1), has a negative impact on investment that is statistically significant – all of the contemporaneous<lb/> and lagged values are negative and significant with a peak impact occurring after one year. This indicates<lb/> that by influencing the cost of debt financing and the opportunity cost of equity financing, interest rate<lb/> changes alter the user cost of capital for Chinese firms and thereby affect investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The long-run impact of changes in the user cost of capital on investment at the firm level is negative<lb/> and statistically significant in all version of the model, except the one estimated using UC2, in which debt<lb/> financing costs are measured using the PBoC benchmark commercial bank lending rate. When the<lb/> effective lending rate is used in the user cost calculation (UC3) the first and second lags are both negative<lb/> and significant to varying degrees, although the contemporaneous coefficient is significantly positive.<lb/> Finally, when the user cost if calculated using the &quot; flow &quot; weights (UC4), all the coefficients are negative<lb/> although only the contemporaneous value is significant at the 5% level. 14 The finding that UC3 – the user<lb/> 14.<lb/> As a result of the additional lag used to calculate the flow weights and the exclusion of negative weights,<lb/> the number of observations in this regression is significantly reduced relative to the benchmark model.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> cost of capital estimated using the benchmark commercial bank lending rate – has no significant impact on<lb/> capital formation implies that this policy interest rate is becoming increasingly irrelevant for<lb/> macroeconomic control and strengthens the case for it to be abolished.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all versions of the model, the cash flow variable is typically highly significant. This may reflect the<lb/> effect of monetary policy operating through the firm&apos;s balance sheet – that is, a change in monetary policy<lb/> translates into a change in the amount of funds available to the firm, and thus affects firm investment. In<lb/> most cases, the coefficient on the first lag is negatively signed, although the long-run elasticity is still<lb/> positive, indicative of binding credit constraints in China&apos;s listed companies sector. Note, however, that<lb/> interpreting the implication of the coefficients on the cash flow variable can be problematic given that<lb/> current investment depends on expected future profits, which may be correlated with current cash flow.<lb/> To assess whether the impact of the user cost of capital and cash flow on investment differs across<lb/> firm size, <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> reports the results of estimating the investment equation with firms split into three equal-<lb/>sized groups based on the number of employees. The results are essentially unchanged from those reported<lb/> in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>. Changes in firm sales have a significant positive effect on investment. There is some evidence<lb/> that investment by large firms is less sensitive to the cost of capital, with the long-run elasticity much<lb/> lower than in the case of small and medium-sized firms, perhaps indicating that SOEs are still somewhat<lb/> less sensitive to the user cost of capital than the private sector. There does not, however, appear to be any<lb/> differences in the impact of cash flow on investment across different-sized firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Dynamic simulation of the benchmark model (UC1) indicates that the impact of interest rate changes<lb/> on business investment is not only statistically significant but also of a scale that is useful for<lb/> macroeconomic stabilisation. In this simulation, the policy interest rate is raised by one percentage point<lb/> while inflation is held constant. This policy rate shock is then reversed linearly over five years. Changes in<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> the policy interest rate are assumed to gradually feed into the interest rate faced by firms according to the<lb/> maturity structure of their debt and the extent of equity financing. 15 The cost of equity financing is driven<lb/> by the cost of long-term debt, which, based on the observed behaviour of Chinese 10-year bond rates,<lb/> increases by 0.2 percentage point for every percentage point rise in short rates. In total, reflecting the<lb/> gradual impact of the policy rate on interest rates faced by firms, the user cost of capital increases by only<lb/> one third of a percentage point in the first year in response to a one percentage point increase in the policy<lb/> rate. Even so, this relatively mild policy interest rate shock is estimated to lead to a cumulative slowdown<lb/> in investment and GDP relative to baseline of 2.5% and 0.9% respectively over the next four years<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact of monetary policy on asset prices<lb/></head>

			<p>A further channel by which monetary policy can influence economic activity is through its impact on<lb/> asset prices. Central bank operations that increase liquidity will cause the prices of private sector assets to<lb/> rise and for investors to move towards less-liquid assets, thereby increasing the prices of longer-term<lb/> securities and then other assets such as stocks and real estate (<ref type="biblio">Bordo and Wheelock, 2004</ref>). This channel<lb/> appears to be quite strong in China. Stock market prices are affected rapidly and to a large extent by<lb/> changes in monetary policy settings. <ref type="biblio">Koivu (2009)</ref>, for example, finds that, over 1998-2008, a one<lb/> percentage point increase in the money supply leads to an increase in equity prices of 3.5% within two<lb/> quarters. The impact of a similar increase in money on house prices is somewhat less (2.5%) and is spread<lb/> out over a two year period. Such findings suggest that much of the surge in house prices in 2010 can be<lb/> 15 .<lb/> This average interest rate is not the rate that enterprises should use in making their investment decision;<lb/> rather the interest rate on new borrowing should be used. However, almost all firm debt is short term, so<lb/> reducing this bias. For the average firm, 80.9% of debt has an original maturity of less than one year. Of<lb/> the remaining long-term debt, 17% had a maturity of less than one year, suggesting an average initial<lb/> maturity of 6 years.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> attributed to the rapid growth of money during 2009. The impact of interest rates, rather than credit<lb/> availability, appears to be much lower (<ref type="biblio">Zhu, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact of monetary policy on consumption is probably small but growing<lb/></head>

			<p>China&apos;s consumer credit market is still relatively small compared with enterprise credit but is<lb/> developing quickly. At the end of the 1990s, there was scarcely a housing market at all. However, as a<lb/> result of housing market reforms that concluded in 1998, the sale of state-owned housing to occupants at<lb/> less than market value resulted in a large number of owner-occupiers with little debt and created the<lb/> potential for a buoyant market. Since then, a re-orientation of the banking system towards more<lb/> commercial lending practices has significantly increased the dynamism of the residential mortgage market.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Banks have rapidly expanded mortgage lending, which has increased by over 20% annually between 2006<lb/> and 2008. Lending accelerated further in 2009 and 2010. In the twelve months to June 2010, residential<lb/> mortgages rose by almost half, reaching almost 13% of total bank lending, an increase of almost three<lb/> percentage points in one year.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The housing market is therefore becoming a significant additional channel through which interest rate<lb/> changes affect the real economy. At the current level of interest rates and assuming a 15-year mortgage, a<lb/> two percentage point increase in interest rates would increase mortgage payments by an amount equivalent<lb/> to 3.5% of consumer spending or 1% of GDP. 16 As yet there is little evidence than changes in housing<lb/> wealth have any impact on private consumption, in contrast to the position in other Asian economies such<lb/> as Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand (<ref type="biblio">Peltonen et al., 2009</ref>). Equity prices appear to have an impact on<lb/> private consumption but the effect is small at best: a 10% rise in stock prices appears to raise private<lb/> consumption by 0.12% according to <ref type="biblio">Peltonen et al. but Koivu (2009)</ref> found no impact.<lb/></p>

			<head>The determinants of Chinese inflation<lb/></head>

			<p>In market economies, the difference between aggregate demand and potential output is a key source<lb/> of changes in inflation pressure: the output gap, as a summary measure of the extent of excess demand, is<lb/> an important link between the real side of the economy and inflation. Given that the investment decisions<lb/> of Chinese firms are sensitive to interest rate changes and the rapid growth of consumer credit, a<lb/> significant relationship between aggregate demand and inflation would provide important evidence of an<lb/> operative monetary policy transmission channel. Of course, for this link to work, prices need to be largely<lb/> determined by market forces, which is generally now the case in <ref type="biblio">China. 17<lb/></ref> From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s the Chinese economy was very volatile, with wide swings in<lb/> the output gap and inflation. Subsequently, the adoption of a fixed exchange rate peg against the dollar,<lb/> following a period of large devaluations, helped reduce inflation volatility. At the same time, with greater<lb/> experience in managing an increasingly market-oriented economy, the gaps between aggregate supply and<lb/> demand have moderated. In addition, the adoption of a more flexible exchange rate policy in 2005<lb/> increased the ability of monetary policy to focus on domestic objectives and stabilise inflation. However,<lb/> in part reflecting the global commodity cycle, inflation began to increase again prior to the global financial<lb/> crisis, with CPI inflation peaking at 8.1% in</p>

			<figure>February 2008. From the beginning of 2009, reflecting a<lb/> 16 .<lb/> Mortgage lending is regulated by the PBoC. Until recently, the mortgage interest rate had to be adjustable<lb/> and linked to the regulated commercial lending rate of the banks. Rates are changed at the beginning of<lb/> each year. Mortgages must be less than 80% of the assessed value of the property and payments must be<lb/> less than 50% of income.<lb/> 17 .<lb/> Price reform in China began in agricultural markets in the late 1970s and gathered pace in the mid-1980s.<lb/> By the early 1990s, almost half of industrial prices had been deregulated.

			<p>marked tightening in monetary policy one year earlier and the global economic recession, Chinese inflation<lb/> declined markedly, turning into deflation. Consistent with China&apos;s recent inflation experience, the OECD&apos;s<lb/> estimate of the output gap indicates significant excess demand in 2007 that subsequently turned into excess<lb/> capacity with the tightening of monetary policy and the global recession (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Empirical assessments of the link between aggregate demand and inflation in China have produced<lb/> mixed results. Using a basic specification of the Phillips curve, <ref type="biblio">Coe and McDermott (1996)</ref> find no support<lb/> for a link between aggregate demand and Chinese inflation over the 1970s and 1980s. <ref type="biblio">Ha et al. (2003)<lb/></ref> measure potential output using a simple linear trend and also find that the Phillips curve fails to explain<lb/> inflation dynamics in China, which they attribute to the difficulties of estimating potential output. In<lb/> contrast, papers using data from the more recent period and output gaps estimated using more appropriate<lb/> techniques do find support for the Phillips curve in Chinese data. For example, Oppers (1997) finds that<lb/> China&apos;s inflation experience does, to a large extent, reflect surges in the main components of aggregate<lb/> demand. <ref type="biblio">Gerlach and Peng (2004)</ref> also find that the Phillips curve fits the Chinese data provided adequate<lb/> care is taken to account for the effect of structural change on price formation in the economy. Finally, in a<lb/> careful analysis that uses time dummies to account for structural change, <ref type="biblio">Scheibe and Vines (2005)</ref> find<lb/> that the output gap, the exchange rate, and inflation expectations all play important roles in explaining<lb/> Chinese inflation.<lb/> To assess the impact of changes in aggregate demand on inflation in China, the following Phillips<lb/> curve is estimated, based on Scheibe and Vines&apos; approach but updated to include five additional years of<lb/> data, at a quarterly frequency and to end-2007:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ε<lb/> γ<lb/> γ<lb/> π<lb/> γ<lb/> π<lb/> γ<lb/> π<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> t<lb/> t<lb/> e<lb/> y<lb/> E<lb/> const<lb/> +<lb/> Δ<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> =<lb/> π<lb/> π<lb/> π<lb/> π<lb/> e<lb/> gap<lb/> gap<lb/> E<lb/> ∑<lb/> ∑<lb/> ∑<lb/> =<lb/> −<lb/> =<lb/> −<lb/> =<lb/> −<lb/> +<lb/> 0<lb/> 0<lb/> 1<lb/> 1<lb/> 1<lb/> Δ<lb/> 4<lb/> 4<lb/> 4<lb/> [6]<lb/></formula>

			<p>where π is the four-quarter percentage change in the consumer price index, E π is expected inflation, y gap is<lb/> the OECD&apos;s estimate of the Chinese output gap derived using a production function methodology and e is<lb/> the nominal effective exchange rate expressed so that an increase is a depreciation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results of estimating this equation are given in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>. In the backward-looking version of the<lb/> model, in which expected inflation is assumed to equal inflation in previous quarters, the coefficient on the<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> output gap is positive and significant, indicating that Chinese inflation does react to the level of excess<lb/> demand in the economy. When aggregate demand is greater than the economy&apos;s supply capacity, inflation<lb/> begins to move upwards in response to shortages in key markets. The converse applies when the output<lb/> gap is negative.<lb/></p>

				<formula>Source: Authors&apos; analysis.<lb/></formula>

			<p>In addition, the coefficients on changes in the nominal effective exchange rate are also highly<lb/> statistically significant, implying that changes in the (trade-weighted) nominal exchange rate also drive<lb/> inflation, with currency appreciation working to bring down inflation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the &quot; hybrid &quot; version of the model, expected inflation is proxied by using both lagged inflation and<lb/> a survey measure of forward-looking inflation expectations. The coefficient on the surveyed inflation<lb/> measure has the expected positive sign and is highly significant indicating that current inflation is<lb/> influenced by expected inflation one year in the future. Furthermore, the sum of the coefficients on lagged<lb/> and forward-looking inflation and changes in the nominal exchange rate are not statistically different from<lb/> one, implying that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical and there is no long run trade-off between excess<lb/> demand and inflation. As a result, any sustained increase in output above potential would lead to ever-<lb/>higher inflation.<lb/></p>

			<p>These results suggest that monetary policy will be more effective than would otherwise be the case<lb/> provided that the PBoC&apos;s pursuit of low and stable inflation is credible. If it is believed that the PBoC will<lb/> adjust policy settings to keep inflation low, this will, to some extent, become self-fulfilling through the<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> impact of expected inflation. As a result, a given reduction in inflation can be brought about by smaller<lb/> changes in the output gap than if expectations were based purely on past inflation.<lb/> Not surprisingly, given price and other reforms in China, Phillips curve estimates are sensitive to the<lb/> sample period and to how structural change is accounted for in the model. However, with a larger share of<lb/> economic activity being conducted by the private sector and subject to market conditions, the relationship<lb/> between excess demand and inflation is likely to become increasingly robust over time.<lb/> While the evidence from estimated policy reaction functions is not yet conclusive, two estimates<lb/> suggest that the PBoC and the State Council do take into account an inflation target in setting interest rates<lb/> and do not rely entirely on quantity-based targets. Using monthly data, He and Pauwels (2008) find that<lb/> interest rates appear to be changed in proportion to the deviation of annual inflation from a rate of 3% and,<lb/> to a lesser extent, to the deviation of money supply growth from the target. Policy interest rates also tend to<lb/> move when foreign exchange reserves are growing. On the other hand, the extent to which output differs<lb/> from trend (the output gap) does not appear to enter into the policy reaction function. Other authors, such<lb/> as Mehorat and Sanchez-Fung (2010), find that inflation enters much more weakly into the reaction<lb/> function.<lb/> The monetary policy cycles of 2007 and 2010 both fit a reaction function in which inflation plays a<lb/> role. In both cases, the tightening cycle for interest rates started a few months after inflation rose above<lb/> 3%. From the point of view of controlling inflation, however, this reaction comes too late, since inflation<lb/> responds to the output gap with a lag of several quarters. Consequently, leaving an increase in interest rates<lb/> until after inflation has reached 3% will cause inflation to overshoot. The PBoC and the State Council need<lb/> to take a more forward-looking approach in which rates are moved in response to demand pressures in the<lb/> goods market, rather than waiting until inflation has breached the target.<lb/></p>

			<head>The role of the exchange rate regime in Chinese monetary policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Since a system of dual exchange rates was abolished in 1994, China&apos;s exchange rate regime has<lb/> officially been described as a managed float. During the first half of the 2000s, however, the renminbi was<lb/> effectively pegged to the US dollar. In July 2005, the renminbi was revalued by 2.1% against the US dollar<lb/> and the bands of permissible daily movements increased to ± 0.3%. The authorities also announced that,<lb/> going forward, the value of the renminbi would be set relative to a currency basket. In practice, the<lb/> authorities did permit the rate of renminbi appreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar to increase after the<lb/> July 2005 announcement but daily changes typically did not test the ± 0.3% bound. 18 Since August 2008<lb/> until recently, the pace of appreciation has stalled and the value of the renminbi has been broadly stable<lb/> against the US dollar.<lb/></p>

			<head>The weights in the renminbi currency basket<lb/></head>

			<p>The official weights in the renminbi currency basket have not been disclosed. However, these weights<lb/> can be estimated using a modified version of a model devised by <ref type="biblio">Frankel and Wei (2007)</ref>. Specifically, the<lb/> following equation is estimated:<lb/></p>

			<table>18 .<lb/> From end-July 2005 to August 2008, the absolute value of daily changes in the renminbi spot rate vis-à-vis<lb/> the US dollar averaged 0.06%, only a small fraction of the permissible maximum. The limit of ± 0.3% was<lb/> reached or exceeded on only three days.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></table>

			<p>In this model, daily changes in the renminbi exchange rate (<lb/> ) are regressed against daily<lb/> changes in the 11 currencies (<lb/></p>

			<p>) that have been disclosed by the PBoC as being in the renminbi<lb/> currency basket (US dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Singapore dollar, UK pound, Malaysian<lb/> ringgit, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Canadian dollar). To reduce the potential for multi-<lb/>collinearity, all of the Asian currencies, except the Japanese yen, are combined into a weighted average<lb/> using their share of Chinese trade as weights. All currencies used in the regression are expressed vis-à-vis<lb/> the IMF&apos;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR). The equation also contains a constant term (<lb/></p>

			<p>The estimation period runs from July 2005, when the Chinese authorities announced that the value of<lb/> the renminbi would be managed relative to a currency basket, until May 2010. The sum of the coefficients<lb/> in the model is constrained to equal one, though this has little impact on the estimation results. The same<lb/> model is also estimated over the entire sample period using the time-varying coefficients methodology<lb/> outlined in Box 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results of estimating equation <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> are given in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>. Over the whole period, as expected, the<lb/> US dollar is the primary currency in the basket with the remainder of the basket containing only other<lb/> Asian currencies and this is confirmed by the use of the time-varying coefficient methodology (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>These results reinforce the view that during the period of currency appreciation, the Chinese<lb/> authorities focussed on the US dollar rate, rather than on a basket that would have more closely reflected<lb/> the share of the US dollar in effective exchange rate calculations. OECD estimates suggest that the weight<lb/> of the United States dollar in an effective exchange rate index should have been around 13% in 2008<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 11</ref>). The addition of currencies closely linked to the US dollar (such as those of Hong Kong, China<lb/> and Chinese Taipei), the weight of the US dollar zone only rises to 24%. (<ref type="table">Table 11</ref>). As a result, the<lb/> effective exchange rate often moves quite strongly even if the rate against the dollar is fixed (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>While the authorities have been reluctant to allow a nominal appreciation of the renminbi against the<lb/> dollar for more than half of the past decade, a real appreciation of the currency normally occurs as an<lb/> economy develops. This is the result of the ratio of prices in the service sector of an economy to prices in<lb/> tradable goods rising towards the ratio seen in advanced countries. As a result, the overall price level<lb/> increases relative to advanced countries and hence the real exchange rate appreciates. This tendency of the<lb/> real exchange to appreciate, and hence for the market exchange rate to approach the purchasing power<lb/> parity of the currency, is known as the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) effect. Allowing for this effect,<lb/> and using the most recent estimates of purchasing power parities, the Chinese currency was close to its<lb/> income-adjusted purchasing power parity level in 2007 (<ref type="biblio">Cheung et al., 2010</ref>). The HBS effect, however, is<lb/> even more pronounced when relative productivity is used, instead of relative income, to measure the extent<lb/> to which an economy lags behind the most advanced countries. Indeed, for the renminbi the gap between<lb/> the productivity-adjusted purchasing power parity and the market exchange rate is even narrower than on<lb/> the income measure.<lb/></p>

			<p>The theoretical expectation that the real exchange would appreciate gradually, is matched by the<lb/> actual gradual real appreciation of the renminbi over the period since the currency became fully convertible<lb/> for trade purposes in 1994. Since then the currency has appreciated on average by 1.7% per year. Such an<lb/> appreciation is almost exactly in line with the cross-sectional slope of the HBS and the speed with which<lb/> the Chinese economy is the closing the productivity gap with the United States.<lb/></p>

			<head>The sterilisation of foreign reserve inflows<lb/></head>

			<p>Over recent years, China&apos;s exchange rate regime has been coming under increasing pressure. Since<lb/> 2005, large current account surpluses and rising capital inflows, particularly of foreign direct investment,<lb/> have resulted in appreciation pressure on the renminbi (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> Panel A). In response, the State<lb/> Administration of Foreign Exchange has sold renminbi, leading to a large and sustained increase in foreign<lb/> reserves to unprecedented levels. In late 2008 and early 2009, sizeable capital outflows slowed the pace of<lb/> foreign reserve accumulation, while a fall in the current account surplus was responsible for a fall in<lb/> reserve accumulation in the first half of 2010 (<ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 15 Panel B). Since the beginning of 2009, the pace of<lb/> reserve accumulation has slowed to USD 28 billion per month down from USD 34 billion per month in the<lb/> previous 18 months. By September 2010, total reserves stood at $2.65 trillion, making China by far the<lb/> world&apos;s largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, ahead of Japan.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves arising from currency intervention has the<lb/> potential to spill over into China&apos;s domestic money market by affecting reserve money growth and wider<lb/> monetary conditions. This has been an important consideration underpinning the policy actions of the<lb/> PBoC over recent years. To limit such effects, the PBoC uses OMOs of PBoC bills and changes in<lb/> commercial bank reserve requirements to drain liquidity from the banking system and sterilise the<lb/> domestic monetary consequences of foreign reserve inflows.<lb/> Since 2002, the value of the PBoC&apos;s sterilisation instruments outstanding has risen roughly in line<lb/> with the stock of foreign exchange reserves, indicating that the central bank has generally been successful<lb/> in offsetting the domestic monetary impact of reserve inflows (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). Accordingly, base money<lb/> growth has been relatively stable, with little evidence of a trend pick-up in the mid-2000s when reserve<lb/> inflows began to accelerate. Since then, the PBoC has primarily relied on reserve requirement hikes to<lb/> offset increased inflows while the issuance of PBoC bills has slowed. Prior to the onset of the global<lb/> financial crisis, the total value of PBoC sterilisation instruments peaked at 27.5% of bank deposits<lb/> (required reserve ratio of 17.5% or CNY 7.8 trillion plus PBoC bill issuance of 10% of bank deposits or<lb/> CNY 4.6 trillion).<lb/></p>

			<p>As part of its efforts to increase liquidity in late 2008 and early 2009, the PBoC used open market<lb/> purchases of PBoC bills and cuts in the required reserves ratios to inject around CNY 780 billion of base<lb/> money, opening a gap between the movement of reserves and the total of the outstanding sterilisation<lb/> instruments (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). This was then progressively reversed from the summer of 2009 and by<lb/> March 2010, the total value of PBoC bills outstanding was CNY 4.3 trillion, equivalent to 6.7% of total<lb/> bank deposits. With the required reserves ratio back to 17% – equivalent to CNY 10 trillion – the PBoC<lb/> was effectively removing almost one quarter of bank deposits from circulation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Relative to the PBoC&apos;s desired rate of reserve money growth – derived from a money supply<lb/> equation – <ref type="biblio">Ouyang et al. (2007)</ref> estimate that the central bank was able to sterilise 92 to 97% of excess<lb/> reserve inflows over 1999-2005. Even during the period of slow appreciation of the currency post 2005,<lb/> the sterilisation of foreign currency purchases was successful. Such periods of slow appreciation can<lb/> complicate the conduct of monetary policy as they can give rise to expectations of further appreciation that<lb/> in turn generate capital inflows. It has been argued that such a policy is inherently unstable, as expectations<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> of further exchange rate rises generate capital inflows on a scale that would make sterilisation impossible<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">McKinnon and Schnabl, 2009</ref>). However, this does not appear to be the case for China, where the PBoC<lb/> was able to maintain the growth rate of M2 very close to its target of 17% during the period of slow<lb/> currency appreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar. While capital flows have been a source of increases in<lb/> reserves in certain periods, over the longer haul the increase in reserves (excluding valuation changes) has<lb/> been the result of the current account surplus and inflows of foreign direct investment (<ref type="table">Table 12</ref>).<lb/> Since 2007, the government has encouraged capital outflows from state-owned enterprises, notably in the<lb/> area of resource-related investments (OECD, 2008), and, together with the creation of a sovereign wealth<lb/> fund, helped reduced pressure on reserve increases, notably in 2008.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the PBoC has generally managed to sterilise the effect of foreign reserve inflows on the<lb/> domestic money supply, holding large reserves is not necessarily costless. Cost/benefit quantification is<lb/> difficult, however, as it depends on several unknowns, including the maturity of bonds held as reserves and<lb/> their currency composition. 19 One extreme case is to assume that all foreign exchange reserves are held in<lb/> dollars, invested in instruments with short-term maturities and financed in local currency by the issue of<lb/> liabilities with similar maturities to the assets. Then, the financing cost depends on the short-term interest<lb/> rate differential between US Treasury and PBoC bills. Since 2003, when the build-up in reserves took off,<lb/> Chinese rates have been, on average, 20 basis points below US rates. This small differential has occurred<lb/> despite capital controls that, in theory, prevent arbitrage between domestic and foreign money markets. In<lb/> total, over the period from June 2003 to October 2009, the cumulated interest cost of financing the reserves<lb/> would have been close to zero on the basis of this extreme assumption. Periods when financing was<lb/> expensive, such as since the beginning of 2008, have been offset by periods when there was a profit in<lb/> holding reserves. This was noticeably the case in 2007, when the Chinese authorities did not follow the<lb/> Federal Reserve in raising short-term interest rates. In the first half of 2010, the financing cost began to<lb/> mount and approached three-quarters of a percentage point of GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the interest rate cost of holding reserves has been minimal, the central bank has incurred<lb/> substantial losses due to the appreciation of the currency against the dollar. If the reserves had been held<lb/> entirely in dollars, the cumulative loss would have amounted to around 6% of annual GDP by<lb/> October 2009 and would eventually require a recapitalisation of the central bank.<lb/></p>

			<p>As well as exposing the central bank and indirectly the government to interest rate and exchange rate<lb/> risk, the PBoC&apos;s sterilisation operations also impose considerable cost on the Chinese banking sector. In<lb/> particular, the interest rate paid by the PBoC on required reserves is typically lower than interest rates<lb/> prevailing in the money market, implying significant opportunity costs for the commercial banks from<lb/> having to hold reserves. This has worked against the impact of regulated interest rates on bank profits,<lb/> described above.<lb/> Sterilisation costs are a fiscal problem and arrangements need to be put in place to pay commercial<lb/> banks a competitive rate of interest on required reserves and ensure that any losses borne by the PBoC are<lb/> transferred to the government in a timely manner without weakening the commercial banking sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>The way forward on exchange-rate reform<lb/></head>

			<p>Perhaps the greatest cost of China&apos;s exchange rate regime is the constraint it imposes on the PBoC&apos;s<lb/> ability to tailor monetary policy to domestic objectives. The essential problem stems from Robert<lb/> Mundell&apos;s &quot; inconsistent trinity &quot; – the impossibility of running an independent monetary policy under a<lb/> fixed exchange rate regime when financial capital is mobile across borders. This arises because, without<lb/> exchange rate adjustment, cross-country differences in interest rates lead to capital flows that affect<lb/> domestic financial conditions. Ultimately, the arbitrage opportunity closes and the central bank is<lb/> prevented from running an independent monetary policy.<lb/> Intervening to sterilise changes in foreign reserves can forestall this adjustment but runs the risk of<lb/> ever-increasing capital flows that could ultimately overwhelm central bank control of the money supply.<lb/> For example, resisting currency appreciation and sterilising the foreign reserve inflow prevents the<lb/> domestic interest rate from falling, which attracts more inflows, necessitating more sterilisation, etc.<lb/> 19 .<lb/> Even if these were known, there would arguably be a need to standardise the risk factors for both assets<lb/> and liabilities, otherwise part of the cost (or apparent profit) would be due to unmatched risk-taking, rather<lb/> than the cost of sterilisation per se.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></figure>

			<p>Eventually, as sterilisation costs become prohibitive, the central bank has no choice but to allow the<lb/> currency to appreciate or interest rates to fall, sparking domestic inflation. In either case, an appreciation of<lb/> the real exchange rate becomes unavoidable.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of China, capital controls do provide the PBoC with some scope for independent monetary<lb/> policy despite a heavily-managed exchange rate regime. Deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) vis-<lb/>à-vis the United States have been relatively large and persistent at times (<ref type="biblio">Ma and McCauley, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Expectations of renminbi appreciation against the US dollar – as measured in the offshore non-deliverable<lb/> forward (NDF) market – have at times influenced the direction and volume of estimated portfolio flows<lb/> across China&apos;s border (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). 20 However, persistent deviations from CIP suggest that these flows are<lb/> insufficient to equalise returns on broadly equivalent assets, implying that China&apos;s capital controls do still<lb/> bind to some degree. In turn, this implies that the PBoC has some autonomy in its monetary policy settings,<lb/> despite the exchange rate regime.<lb/></p>

Portfolio<lb/> inflows are measured as the difference between the monthly changes in foreign exchange reserves and the sum of the monthly trade<lb/> balance data and an interpolated series for foreign direct capital inflows and the service part of the current account.<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>It remains an open question, however, whether the degree of autonomy afforded by China&apos;s capital<lb/> controls will be sufficient to allow the PBoC to conduct monetary policy in an optimal way in the future.<lb/> Assessing central bank performance in this regard is not straightforward given the difficulties of isolating<lb/> the effect of monetary policy on the macroeconomy. Since the &quot; boom/bust &quot; cycles of the 1980s and 1990s,<lb/> Chinese inflation volatility has fallen considerably. However, inflation volatility was also lower in most<lb/> other countries after 2000 and Chinese inflation remains more volatile than in most OECD countries,<lb/> including the United States, against whose currency the renminbi has been extremely stable (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>),<lb/> 20 .<lb/> A number of authors have investigated the drivers of portfolio inflows in China, finding that to some extent<lb/> they are correlated with expected movements in the exchange rate, interest rate differentials and asset<lb/> market returns (<ref type="biblio">Anderson, 2007; Ma and McCauley, 2007</ref>).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> suggesting some difficulty in using monetary policy to stabilise inflation, all the more so as supply shocks<lb/> from the agricultural sector are more important in China than in advanced economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although a range of factors are at play, the PBoC&apos;s policy actions do, indeed seem often to reflect<lb/> balance-of-payments concerns at the expense of domestic policy objectives. For example, Burdekin and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Siklos (2006)</ref> find that changes in foreign reserves play a significant role in the PBoC&apos;s monetary policy<lb/> reaction function. Similarly, <ref type="biblio">Ouyang et al. (2007)</ref> find evidence that changes in foreign reserves have a<lb/> significant impact on changes in the PBoC&apos;s net domestic assets, implying that maintaining a targeted<lb/> exchange rate narrows the scope for monetary policy to address domestic objectives and a failure to fully<lb/> sterilise inflows. Moreover, Laurens and Maino (2007) argue that China&apos;s tightly managed exchange rate<lb/> prevents greater reliance on interest rates to manage aggregate demand given that, theoretically, a<lb/> tightening might result in larger capital inflows. However, capital controls have been quite successful in<lb/> restraining capital flows. Indeed, Ma and Macauly (2007) found that capital controls had been sufficiently<lb/> strong to ensure that China had been able to maintain a monetary policy as independent from that of the<lb/> United States as did the European Central Bank which had the opposite combination of policies designed<lb/> to give an independent monetary policy (namely a floating exchange rate and no capital controls). 21<lb/> 21 .<lb/> However, in making this comparison, the wider macroeconomic context needs to be taken into account.<lb/> For example, if, compared to the euro area, China&apos;s business cycle is less correlated with the US cycle,<lb/> then, all else equal, Chinese interest rates will need to deviate from US rates by a relatively larger margin<lb/> for monetary policy to be optimal.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/></figure>

			<p>The monetary policy constraints imposed by China&apos;s exchange rate regime are reinforced by concerns<lb/> over the impact of central bank actions on sterilisation costs and the value of China&apos;s foreign reserve<lb/> holdings. Given that the existing stock of PBoC bills has an average maturity of less than one year,<lb/> changes in domestic interest rates aimed at controlling inflation quickly affect sterilisation costs.<lb/> Contingent losses on foreign reserves also temper the extent of renminbi appreciation permitted by the<lb/> Chinese authorities. A preference to contain the increase in China&apos;s foreign reserve holdings has prompted<lb/> recent efforts to promote the use of the renminbi in international trade and finance. 22 However, if the<lb/> renminbi is to be used more widely internationally, China&apos;s capital controls will need to be eliminated so<lb/> that foreigners can invest in renminbi-denominated assets and easily repatriate their capital and income.<lb/> China will eventually require a flexible exchange rate regime with open capital markets. The next step<lb/> in this direction would be to link the Chinese currency to a basket of currencies of major trading partners<lb/> and to announce the composition of the basket. The value of the currency would still be influenced by<lb/> different factors than those affecting China but the degree of correlation with shocks might be less than in<lb/> the case of linking to the US dollar, as over 44% of the OECD basket for China is accounted for by Asian<lb/> currencies (excluding those linked to the dollar). Under such a regime, in order to mitigate the potential for<lb/> abrupt changes in the value of the renminbi to destabilise economic activity, the PBoC would smooth<lb/> short-run exchange rate fluctuations while allowing the exchange rate to reach its market-determined level<lb/> over longer horizons. Greater exchange rate flexibility would facilitate the implementation of a monetary<lb/> policy geared to domestic objectives. The next step could entail a greater liberalisation of capital outflows<lb/> and a degree of foreign investment in Chinese bond markets, either by allowing foreign investors access to<lb/> the government bond market or allowing greater issuance of renminbi bonds by foreign issuers. The recent<lb/> moves to allow certain banks to issue bonds in the Hong Kong market are a step in this direction as are the<lb/> moves to allow settlement of foreign trade in the Chinese currency. However, these avenues of<lb/> convertibility are still in their infancy with only CNY 18.3 billion of trade settled in renminbi in the first<lb/> quarter of 2010 (about 0.3% of trade in goods and services).<lb/></p>

			<p>Greater exchange rate flexibility would also enhance the exchange rate&apos;s role as an automatic<lb/> stabiliser that helps smooth business cycle volatility, as China becomes more integrated with the global<lb/> economy. The empirical modelling work discussed above indicates that changes in the real effective<lb/> exchange rate are a significant determinant of changes in aggregate demand and that the nominal exchange<lb/> rate influences inflation. 23<lb/> At the moment, greater exchange rate flexibility would likely result in currency appreciation, increase<lb/> the labour share of income and the purchasing power of households and help reorient investment towards<lb/> the non-tradables sector. However, it would also likely entail a short-term output cost that might warrant<lb/> offsetting measures to boost domestic demand. In these circumstances, the authorities may be inclined to<lb/> 22 .<lb/> From mid-2009, selected firms in five Chinese cities have been able to settle transactions in renminbi with<lb/> businesses in Hong Kong and Macau. Foreign banks are able to buy or borrow renminbi from mainland<lb/> lenders to finance such trade. The PBoC has also signed currency-swap agreements with Argentina,<lb/> Belarus, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea and will make renminbi available to pay for<lb/> Chinese imports if these economies run short of foreign exchange. Hong Kong banks are now allowed to<lb/> issue yuan-denominated bonds, a step towards building an offshore renminbi market. From August 2009,<lb/> foreigners can open renminbi denominated bank accounts in Hong Kong and banks are free to make both<lb/> interbank transfers and loans in the currency (provided the loans are used outside the mainland), but banks<lb/> cannot yet invest unused balances in the mainland interbank bond market.<lb/> 23 .<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Shu and Yip (2006)</ref> also find that changes in the exchange rate influence aggregate demand, through the<lb/> net exports channel, as well as inflation.<lb/></p>

			<p>ECO/WKP(2010)78<lb/> wait until inflation becomes a problem once again before allowing an appreciation. Greater exchange rate<lb/> flexibility would also reduce the pace at which China&apos;s exposure to US dollar assets is rising. Although<lb/> this may entail an initial capital loss on existing reserves, as the renminbi appreciates, it would lower<lb/> China&apos;s exposure to future losses.<lb/></p>

			<head>The benefits of moving towards a flexible inflation target<lb/></head>

			<p>Greater exchange rate flexibility raises the question of the most appropriate nominal anchor for<lb/> Chinese monetary policy. The PBoC&apos;s reliance on the stock of money as an intermediate policy target is<lb/> problematic. Although a number of studies have identified a link between money growth and inflation in<lb/> the long run, short-run instabilities in the rate of money growth consistent with low and stable inflation<lb/> indicate that a money target is not a good stand-alone nominal anchor (<ref type="biblio">Laurens and Maino, 2007</ref>). In<lb/> addition, simple quantity-based frameworks do not handle shocks very well and are susceptible to errors in<lb/> forecasting money demand. The authorities&apos; reaction function should place greater weight on<lb/> forward-looking indicators of inflation and not just react when inflation breaches pre-announced or even<lb/> undeclared targets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Indeed, changes in the PBoC&apos;s policy stance should be predicated on informed judgements based on<lb/> monitoring a set of indicators in the framework of a flexible inflation objective over the medium term.<lb/> Because money growth and inflation are correlated in the long run, money aggregates would still have an<lb/> important role to play as informational variables within this framework. 24 This would facilitate the PBoC<lb/> &quot; leaning against &quot; excess credit creation and the build-up of related imbalances that have contributed to the<lb/> recent failure of monetary policy in a number of countries to ensure macro and financial stability (White,<lb/> 2009).<lb/> Incorporating a forward-looking inflation objective into the PBoC&apos;s monetary policy framework<lb/> would yield a number of additional benefits. 25 Specifically, an inflation objective is transparent and easily<lb/> understood by the public. So when monetary policy is credible, a forward-looking inflation objective can<lb/> help condition inflation expectations, which can play an important role in macroeconomic stabilisation. In<lb/> addition, an inflation objective has the advantage of focusing the political debate on what monetary policy<lb/> is able to achieve in the long run, namely controlling inflation, and away from what monetary policy<lb/> cannot do, namely permanently increasing output growth, lowering unemployment or keeping the real<lb/> exchange rate at some predetermined level.<lb/> Moving China&apos;s monetary policy framework in this direction would require a range of enhancements<lb/> in other areas. Incorporating an inflation objective into the policy framework would allow a rethink of<lb/> NDRC policies that attempt to influence inflation by controlling individual prices. China&apos;s macroeconomic<lb/> statistics would also need to continue to improve to provide the PBoC with better information to monitor<lb/> the economy and communicate its policy intentions. Improved macroeconomic statistics would allow for<lb/> better conditional macroeconomic forecasts to inform policy decisions. The literature on Chinese<lb/> macro-modelling is still relatively sparse, but the empirical models discussed in this paper and used in<lb/> other research suggest that relatively stable macroeconomic relationships are beginning to emerge.<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue of central bank independence would also need to be addressed. Currently in China,<lb/> decisions to adjust the PBoC&apos;s monetary policy instruments are made by the State Council. Modernising<lb/> the framework would require granting the PBoC instrument independence so it can react promptly and<lb/> decisively to changing economic circumstances without being swayed by political concerns. Operational<lb/> independence would allow the PBoC to generate and sustain the credibility it needs to effectively influence<lb/> inflation expectations. The State Council would still set the strategic objectives, but leave implementation<lb/> to the PBoC.<lb/> As the exchange rate regime evolves towards greater flexibility, monetary policy should focus<lb/> increasingly on domestic objectives, notably the goal of price stability over the medium term. The<lb/> monetary policy transmission mechanism is operational and the PBoC needs to be able to move short-term<lb/> interest rates in a wider range to enhance the role of monetary policy in buffering the economy from<lb/> domestic and external shocks.<lb/></p>
