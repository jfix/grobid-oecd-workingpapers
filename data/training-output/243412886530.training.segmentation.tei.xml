			<body>Africa in 2007 <lb/>Multifaceted Growth <lb/>by Kenneth G. Ruffing <lb/>(based on the African Economic Outlook 2007*) <lb/>No. 4 7 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>4.0 <lb/>5.0 <lb/>6.0 <lb/>7.0 <lb/>8.0 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006(e) 2007(p) 2008(p) <lb/>Africa <lb/>Net Oil exporters <lb/>Net Oil importers <lb/>fFigure 1. Growth differential between oil exporters and the rest <lb/>is set to sharpen <lb/>♦ Growth will accelerate for net oil exporters and weaken slightly for oil importers, strengthening the trends <lb/>projected in African Economic Outlook 2006. <lb/>♦ For the oil importers, moreover, inflation is moving to double-digit levels. <lb/>♦ Budget deficits in oil-importing countries appear to have stabilised. <lb/>♦ The current account deficits of these same countries have increased from 2 per cent in 1998-2004, to <lb/>about 4 per cent since 2005. <lb/>Africa grew by 5.5 per cent in 2006 – well above the <lb/>long-term trend and for the fourth consecutive year. GDP <lb/>per capita grew by about 3.5 per cent. Growth also <lb/>appears set to accelerate somewhat on average in 2007, <lb/>and to remain buoyant in 2008 <lb/>The challenge is to ensure that a large proportion of the <lb/>proceeds from the minerals sector are invested in <lb/>infrastructure and human capital development to support <lb/>medium-and long-term needs for diversification. <lb/>Temporary windfall gains make the re-orientation of <lb/>government budgets urgent. Enhancing transparency and <lb/>combating corruption is key to realising this transformation <lb/>and maintaining growth. The continuation of sound <lb/>macroeconomic polices in most countries on the continent, <lb/>for example, has increased business confidence leading <lb/>to a pickup in private investment generally. <lb/>Oil-importing countries will need to contain inflationary <lb/>pressures now running into double-digits as a result of oil <lb/>price increases, and to finance or contain increases in their <lb/>current account deficits. <lb/>Meanwhile, contrasts between oil <lb/>exporters and the rest are set to sharpen. <lb/>In 2007 the average real GDP growth rate <lb/>for the continent is expected to be 5.9 per <lb/>cent, with the difference between the two <lb/>groups of countries even more marked at <lb/>7.4 and 4.7 per cent, respectively. <lb/>Projections for 2008 are for slightly lower <lb/>growth for the oil exporters and about the <lb/>same for the oil-importers as in 2007. <lb/>The economic gains of the oil producers <lb/>are largely due to increasing in oil <lb/>production and sustained high prices. New <lb/>producers – Chad, Equatorial Guinea and <lb/>Mauritania– and those opening up new <lb/>fields – like Angola, which has more than <lb/>doubled its production since 1990 to <lb/>1.4 million barrels a day in 2006 – were able <lb/>Source: African Economic Outlook 2006/2007. <lb/>No. 14 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 2 <lb/>2 2 <lb/>Policy Insights #47, ©OECD 2007 <lb/>www.oecd.org/dev/insights <lb/>Policy Insights, No. 47, April 2007 <lb/>ODA can help <lb/>Readers are encouraged to quote or reproduce material from OECD <lb/>Development Centre Policy Insights for their own publications.

The resulting windfall gains could set such <lb/>countries firmly on the road to development. <lb/>The oil-importing countries have not been left behind. Metals <lb/>producers also profited from higher world prices and to a <lb/>lesser extent higher export volumes. Mozambique, Namibia, <lb/>South Africa and Zambia all made up for the dearer oil with <lb/>their aluminium, iron, copper and platinum exports. <lb/>The price of agricultural exports has been falling, hurting <lb/>countries dependent on them, but 2006 turned out not to <lb/>be too bad. Rubber, coffee and seafood exporters enjoyed <lb/>good prices that helped trade balances. Some producers, <lb/>despite weak world prices (of cotton, for example), <lb/>managed to boost exports substantially thanks to good <lb/>weather, and some in Central and East Africa (Madagascar, <lb/>Rwanda and Tanzania) and West Africa (Benin, Burkina <lb/>Faso, Ghana, and Mali) achieved high export growth as <lb/>well. A number of diversified exporters also exhibited strong <lb/>export volume growth (Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco). <lb/>High energy prices may be good for exporters of oil, but <lb/>they can be bad for controlling inflation and the continent <lb/>as a whole saw inflation increase to 9.1 in 2006. This <lb/>continent-wide average masks important differences <lb/>between net oil-exporters and net oil-importers, whose <lb/>figure rose from 8.4 per cent in 2005 to 12 per cent in <lb/>2006. Further increases, to 12.7 per cent in 2007 and to <lb/>12.9 per cent in 2008 are expected. That said, only four <lb/>countries (Angola, DRC, Guinea-Bissau, and Zimbabwe) <lb/>experienced inflation rates at or above 20 per cent in 2005, <lb/>and the number remained the same in 2006 ( DRC, Guinea-<lb/>Bissau, São Tomé and Principe and Zimbabwe). <lb/>Continuing high oil prices – which seem likely – are a major <lb/>medium-term risk for the continent&apos;s net oil importers and <lb/>may endanger their efforts to maintain macroeconomic <lb/>stability if the financing of the larger current account deficits <lb/>leads to a build up of unsustainable debt levels once again. <lb/>It also makes poverty reduction even harder by putting <lb/>pressure on government budgets. <lb/>African countries need to husband their resources much <lb/>more carefully to pay for the key goals of reducing poverty <lb/>and raising the quality of life for their populations. This <lb/>remains true for both oil-exporting and importing countries. <lb/>The temptation for the former is to waste resources through <lb/>inefficiency and corruption, while for the latter, the challenge <lb/>is to implement policies to sustain and diversify the economy <lb/>in the face of variable world prices. </body>
