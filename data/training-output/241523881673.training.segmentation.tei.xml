			<body>SUMMARY <lb/>1. <lb/>This paper examines health workforce and migration policies in New Zealand, with a special <lb/>focus on the international recruitment of doctors and nurses. <lb/>2. <lb/>The health workforce in New Zealand, as in all OECD countries, plays a central role in the health <lb/>system. Nonetheless, maybe more than for any other OECD country, the health workforce in New Zealand <lb/>cannot be considered without taking into account its international dimension. <lb/>3. <lb/>New Zealand has the highest proportion of migrant doctors among OECD countries, and one of <lb/>the highest for nurses. There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the <lb/>permanent and temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their <lb/>qualification recognised to immigrate in New Zealand. At the same time, New Zealand also has high <lb/>emigration rates of health workers, mainly to other OECD countries. International migration is thus at the <lb/>same time an opportunity and a challenge for the management of the human resources for health (HRH) in <lb/>New Zealand. <lb/>4. <lb/>Increasing international competition for highly skilled workers raises important issues such as <lb/>sustainability and ability to compete in a global market. In this context, new approaches to improve the <lb/>international recruitment of health workers, as well as developing alternative policies, may need to be <lb/>considered. As for international recruitment, better coordination and stronger collaboration between main <lb/>stakeholders could contribute to more effective and pertinent international recruitment. <lb/></body>

			<body>RESUMÉ <lb/>5. <lb/>Ce document examine les effectifs de professionnels de la santé et les politiques migratoires de la <lb/>Nouvelle-Zélande, en se concentrant plus particulièrement sur le recrutement international de médecins et <lb/>d&apos;infirmières. <lb/>6. <lb/>En Nouvelle-Zélande comme dans tous les pays de l&apos;OCDE, ces professionnels jouent un rôle <lb/>crucial dans le système de santé. Dans ce pays, pourtant, peut-être plus que dans tout autre pays de <lb/>l&apos;OCDE, on ne saurait étudier les travailleurs de la santé sans prendre en compte la dimension <lb/>internationale de cette population. <lb/>7. <lb/>La Nouvelle-Zélande compte la proportion de médecins immigrés la plus élevée de tous les pays <lb/>de l&apos;OCDE, celle des infirmières immigrées comptant aussi parmi les plus fortes. Le pays ne s&apos;est pas doté <lb/>d&apos;une politique d&apos;immigration particulière concernant ces professions même si Les filières d&apos;immigration <lb/>permanente ou temporaire font qu&apos;il est relativement facile pour les médecins et les infirmières qui <lb/>parviennent à faire reconnaître leurs diplômes d&apos;aller s&apos;installer en Nouvelle-Zélande. En parallèle, le pays <lb/>présente également des taux élevés d&apos;émigration de travailleurs de la santé (principalement vers les autres <lb/>pays de l&apos;OCDE). En matière de gestion des ressources humaines de la santé, les migrations internationales <lb/>représentent donc à la fois une chance et une difficulté pour la Nouvelle-Zélande. <lb/>8. <lb/>La concurrence internationale croissante pour attirer des travailleurs hautement qualifiés soulève <lb/>des problèmes importants comme la soutenabilité et la capacité à affronter cette concurrence sur un marché <lb/>mondialisé. Dans ce contexte, il faudrait peut-être réfléchir à de nouvelles stratégies pour améliorer le <lb/>recrutement international de travailleurs de la santé et élaborer d&apos;autres mesures possibles. Quant à ce <lb/>recrutement, l&apos;amélioration de la coordination et le renforcement de la collaboration entre les principales <lb/>parties prenantes pourraient contribuer à le rendre plus effectif et plus approprié. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>9. <lb/>The health workforce in New Zealand, as in all OECD countries, plays a central role in the health <lb/>system. In New Zealand, it accounts for about 70% of the costs of delivering public health services and <lb/>5.5% of the workforce (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; OECD Health Data, 2007). Despite <lb/>the key role of the health workforce in the health system, it has not been at the core of the various health <lb/>system reforms in New Zealand. Nonetheless, health workforce issues have captured more attention <lb/>recently, and there is now a growing recognition of their importance. <lb/>10. <lb/>Maybe more than for any other OECD country, the health workforce in New Zealand cannot be <lb/>considered without taking into account its international dimension. New Zealand has the highest proportion <lb/>of migrant doctors among OECD countries, and one of the highest for nurses. At the same time, New <lb/>Zealand also has high emigration rates of health workers, mainly to other OECD countries. International <lb/>migration is thus at the same time an opportunity and a challenge for the management of the human <lb/>resources for health (HRH) in New Zealand. This emphasises the need to better understand and strengthen <lb/>the interactions between training, career development and international migration of health workers, a <lb/>necessity reinforced by the increasing international competition for talent, and in particular health <lb/>professionals. <lb/>11. <lb/>This paper examines health workforce and migration policies in New Zealand, with a special <lb/>focus on the international recruitment of doctors and nurses. In the first section, an overview of the health <lb/>workforce is presented. Health workforce policies are discussed in the second section with a focus on <lb/>international mobility. The third section addresses more specifically the current and future challenges <lb/>related to in-and out-migration. <lb/>Main findings <lb/>• With 2.2 practising physicians per 1 000 population, New Zealand has a lower density than the <lb/>OECD average (3.1‰). The reverse is true for nurses (9.5‰ as compared to 8.7‰). The <lb/>geographical distribution of doctors and nurses is an important issue in New Zealand, as in many <lb/>other OECD countries. Ageing and feminization of the health workforce are two other features <lb/>that are shared by many other countries.<lb/>• The importance of in-and out-migration is a key characteristic of the health workforce in New <lb/>Zealand. New Zealand has the highest ratios of foreign-born and foreign-trained doctors in <lb/>OECD countries (respectively 52% and 36% in 2005-06) and among the highest for nurses (29% <lb/>and 24%, respectively). New Zealand also has the third highest and the second highest <lb/>expatriation rates for doctors and nurses (28.5% and 23%, respectively).<lb/>• The number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries represents half the <lb/>number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The number of New Zealand-born nurses living <lb/>in other OECD countries is matched by the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand <lb/>(about 7 500).<lb/></body>

			<body>• There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the permanent and <lb/>temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their qualification <lb/>recognised to immigrate in New Zealand.<lb/>• The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stays of <lb/>health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While this is certainly a good policy to <lb/>address workforce shortages in rural areas, short-term migration raises issues in terms of <lb/>turnover. More generally, in the New Zealand context, retention of health professionals is a key <lb/>issue because attrition rates (for doctors) and turnover rates (for nurses) tend to be quite high.<lb/>• Despite repeated calls for &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; in recent official reports, New Zealand trains <lb/>proportionally less medical graduates than OECD countries on average. It also has very few <lb/>foreign medical students. As for nurses, the training rate is close to the OECD average, but out-<lb/>migration, notably to Australia, partly offsets this effort.<lb/>• A broad portfolio of policies, in line with the recommendations of the Health Workforce <lb/>Advisory Committee and more recently of the Health Workforce Taskforce, including improving <lb/>salaries and working conditions, developing further skill-mix approaches, attracting back health <lb/>workers who left New Zealand, reinforcing the links between education and management of the <lb/>health workforce policies, would need further consideration.<lb/>• Strengthening coordination between the main actors—the Department of labour, the Ministry of <lb/>Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Tertiary Education Commission, but also with and <lb/>between District Health Boards (DHBs)—could help to better address short and long-term <lb/>shortages.<lb/>• To date, immigration has been a very significant part of the supply of health workers in New <lb/>Zealand. However, further increase in the number of overseas-trained health professionals might <lb/>place New Zealand in a delicate position, as it could become too dependent on immigration in a <lb/>context where many other OECD countries are also looking to recruit foreign doctors and nurses.<lb/></body>

			<body>1. OVERVIEW <lb/>12. <lb/>While the evolution of the health workforce over the past 25 years shows similar trends to those <lb/>observed for the OECD as a whole, density for doctors tends to be lower than the OECD average but it is <lb/>higher for nurses. Recent changes in terms of the regional distribution, gender mix and ageing of the health <lb/>workforce are mostly shared with other OECD countries. At the same time, New Zealand is characterised <lb/>by both large immigration and emigration of doctors and nurses. <lb/>Health workforce density: occupational, regional and trend variations <lb/>13. <lb/>As depicted in Chart 1a, with 2.2 practising physicians per 1 000 population, New Zealand is <lb/>below the OECD average of 3.1‰. As for nurses, with 9.5 practising nurses per 1 000 population, New <lb/>Zealand is slightly above the OECD average of 8.7‰. Results are more contrasted in terms of skill mix, as <lb/>the number of nurses per doctor amounts to 4.3 which is significantly higher than the OECD average of <lb/>2.8. As far as other health professionals are concerned, the population ratio for pharmacists is quite close to <lb/>the OECD average at 0.75‰, while the corresponding figure for dentists is 50% lower than the OECD <lb/>average (0.4‰ as compared to 0.62‰). <lb/>14. <lb/>Because the population of New Zealand is relatively small (about 4 million), the moderate <lb/>density figures translate into low numbers of doctors and nurses. Indeed, it is estimated that there are 9 000 <lb/>practising physicians and around 38 000 practising nurses and midwives in New Zealand (OECD, Health <lb/>Data, 2006). About a third of the practising physicians are in general practice. While General Practitioners <lb/>are essentially working in ambulatory practices, this is not the case for specialists who mainly work in <lb/>public hospitals. Moreover, the proportion of specialists working in public hospitals increased over time, <lb/>from 49% in 2000 to 74% in 2005 (Medical Council, 2007). In some specialities such as vascular surgery, <lb/>neurosurgery or paediatric surgery, no more than 20 physicians are registered. 4 In this context, if a few <lb/>specialists opt to emigrate this can have a major impact on health care delivery. <lb/>15. <lb/>New Zealand is also characterised by significant imbalances in the geographic distribution of <lb/>health professionals, as are most OECD countries. The lowest ratios of medical practitioners to population <lb/>are found in rural regions in the North Island and in the West coast of the South Island (see Map 1). On the <lb/>other hand, the highest ratios are in the larger urban regions, mainly Auckland, and Capital and Coast <lb/>(Wellington and Kapiti) regions. <lb/>16. <lb/>The differences are even more marked when performing the analysis on the basis of Territorial <lb/>Authorities 5 . While in the cities of Auckland, Dunedin and Hamilton, there are more than 400 full-time-<lb/>equivalent doctors per 100 000 population, the corresponding figure is below 40 in the districts of Opotiki, <lb/>Wairoa, Westland, Waimakariri and Southland (Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). A large part of <lb/>4 <lb/>There are only five specialists registered in breast medicine, 12 in rehabilitation medicine and 13 in oral <lb/>and maxillofacial surgery. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">5 <lb/>There are 74 territorial authorities in New Zealand, including 16 city councils and 58 district councils. <lb/>They provide local services. <lb/></note>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 <lb/></note>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>these differences, notably for specialists, can be attributed to the presence of hospitals in cities. Geographic <lb/>distribution of registered nurses appears to be more even, complementing to some extent the &quot; lack &quot; of <lb/>other types of health professionals in some regions (e.g. West Coast). <lb/>Chart 1a.

However, this increase is lower <lb/>than for the OECD as a whole (2.1%), reinforcing the discrepancy in terms of density. <lb/></body>

			<body>Demographic characteristics of the health workforce: feminization and ageing <lb/>19. <lb/>New common trends have emerged in the health workforce of OECD countries in recent years, <lb/>which may impact both the supply and the demand for health care. While health workforce ageing, <lb/>feminization and new working patterns may result in a reduction in the supply of health workers, <lb/>population ageing and technological changes are anticipated to increase the demand for health care <lb/>services. <lb/>20. <lb/>With regard to the ageing of its health workforce, New Zealand is not an exception: the average <lb/>age is estimated at 45 for nurses and 44 for doctors. In 1990, about 35% of medical practitioners were <lb/>under 35 years of age but by 2003 this percentage had fallen to 23% (see Chart 3a). This trend is even <lb/>more marked for general practitioners and for registered nurses and midwives. <lb/>Chart 3b. Age distribution of registered nurses and midwives in New Zealand, 1994-2004 <lb/>Note. Data excludes enrolled nurses <lb/>Source: New Zealand Health Workforce Statistics 2004, NZHIS <lb/>0% <lb/>5% <lb/>10% <lb/>15% <lb/>20% <lb/>25% <lb/>20-24 <lb/>25-29 <lb/>30-34 <lb/>35-39 <lb/>40-44 <lb/>45-49 <lb/>50-54 <lb/>55-59 <lb/>60+ <lb/>1994 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2004 <lb/>21. <lb/>As illustrated in Chart 4, feminization of the medical workforce has been one of most notable <lb/>changes over the past three decades in New Zealand. Women doctors now represent 37% of all medical <lb/>practitioners compared to 16.4% in 1980. They also count for about 50% of the current medical trainees <lb/>(Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). The feminisation <lb/>of the medical workforce brings changes in working patterns as female doctors tend to concentrate more in <lb/>primary care (family medicine, paediatrics, and psychiatry) and to work more part-time than their male <lb/>counterparts. However, growing numbers are training in specialist branches such as radiation, oncology, <lb/>pathology and several areas of surgery (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002). In comparison, the <lb/>nursing workforce is still quite gender-biased with only about 6% of male registered nurses and midwives. <lb/></body>

In New Zealand, the average hours worked per week by <lb/>medical practitioners decreased from 48 in 2001 to 45.8 in 2004 (Medical Council of New Zealand, 2001; , <lb/>Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). The results of the 2005 Royal New Zealand College of General <lb/>Practitioners (RNZCGP) Membership Survey suggest that among the 25-45 age cohort, very few GPs <lb/>really want to be in full-time general practice, whether it is salaried or self-employed. There is a preference <lb/>for locum work, part-time general practice, sub-specialties, non-GP medical work, and even non-medical <lb/>work. One reason for this could be the desire for more balance between work and private life. This trend is <lb/>shared by many OECD countries. It is expected to continue and accentuate as the workforce is ageing and <lb/>feminising. This will probably contribute to reinforce the future need for medical practitioners and it raises <lb/>critical issues with regard to ways of ensuring continuity of service. <lb/>Box 1. Māori health workforce <lb/>The indigenous Māori population is underrepresented in the health workforce. While Māori population represented <lb/>about 15% of New Zealand population in 2003, Māoris made up only 2.7% of the medical workforce and 6.3% of the <lb/>nursing workforce. Despite the low proportion of Māori in the health workforce, their number is increasing. Policies <lb/>have been developed in order to increase their participation. Specific Māori health workforce plans have been <lb/>established. At national level, the Raranga Tupuake Māori Health Workforce Development Plan has strategies to <lb/>increase the number of Māori in the workforce at all levels, to expand the skill base of Māori currently in the workforce <lb/>and enable equitable access for Māori to future training opportunities. The latter includes collaboration between the <lb/>Minister of Health and traditional Māori healers to explore options for training and career pathways. District Health <lb/>Boards as major employers also have a key role in Māori workforce development. For instance, the MidCentral District <lb/>Health Board developed a Māori Health Workforce Strategy which aims, among other things, to involve Māori at all <lb/>levels including planning, development and the delivery of health care programs and services. <lb/>Sources: Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2006; Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2003; Ministry of Health (2005) Raranga <lb/>Tupuake Māori Health Workforce Development Plan Discussion document, MoH, Wellington; MidCentral District Health Board (2005) <lb/>Māori Health Workforce Strategy, Mid Central DHB. <lb/>7 <lb/>One important evolution refers to recent legislative changes on working hours, notably for junior doctors. <lb/>New Zealand has been a pioneer in this area because, since the implementation of the New Zealand <lb/>Resident doctors&apos; (NZRDA) Multi-Employer Collective Agreement (MECA) in 1985, junior doctors have <lb/>been limited to 72 hours of work per week (maximum 16 consecutive hours). The current agreement <lb/>between employers and trade unions is to work towards a 60-hour work week limit (see Landrigan 2006). <lb/></body>

			<body>Immigrant and expatriate health workforce: New Zealand in a global context <lb/>23. <lb/>A major feature of the New Zealand health workforce is the importance of immigrant health <lb/>workers. According to the 2006 census, about 52% of the medical doctors (5 200), 29% of the nurses (10 <lb/>500) and 39% and 23% of the dentists (590) and pharmacists (720), respectively were born abroad (see <lb/>Annex 1). <lb/>24. <lb/>Immigration not only plays an important role in shaping New Zealand health workforce but its <lb/>role in clearly increasing (see Chart 5). The share of foreign-born increased by 10 percentage points among <lb/>doctors and nurses over the past 15 years. This increase was larger than the equivalent increase in the <lb/>foreign-born among the high-skilled workforce in New Zealand. <lb/>Chart 5.

The second most important origin country is <lb/>Australia for nurses (8%) and South Africa for doctors (13%). OECD countries as a whole account for <lb/>about half of the immigrant doctors and 65% of the nurses. Pacific Islanders also make a significant <lb/>contribution to the New Zealand health workforce, notably for nurses, especially taking into account the <lb/>small size of their countries of origin. <lb/>26. <lb/>The information based on place of birth could give a distorted image of the role of international <lb/>migration in shaping the health workforce if a significant share of these foreign-born were actually trained <lb/>in New Zealand and not in their origin country. In the case of New Zealand, however, the two indicators <lb/>are very close for nurses. Around 24% of nurses in New Zealand were foreign-trained in 2004 (see Chart <lb/>6). This is not the case for doctors, as approximately 36% of active medical practitioners in New Zealand <lb/>were foreign-trained in 2005 8 . <lb/></body>

Travelling overseas is viewed as a positive thing and an integral part of the lifestyle choices of <lb/>many young New Zealanders. Health professionals are certainly no exception in this respect. Circa 2000, <lb/>the number of New Zealand-born individuals living in other OECD country amounted to about 1 900 for <lb/>doctors, 7 600 for nurses, 410 for pharmacists and 330 for dentists (see Table 2). In total, we estimate that <lb/>23% of New Zealand-born nurses and 29% of doctors were working in another OECD country in their <lb/>occupation. To a certain extent, these figures might even underestimate the importance of out-migration, as <lb/>they do not cover emigration of New Zealanders born outside New Zealand and do not include people who <lb/>were trained as health professionals but are working in another occupation overseas. <lb/>Table 2.

Nonetheless, its importance <lb/>varies across health professions. While it is estimated that 51% of New Zealand-born dentists living abroad <lb/>are in Australia, this figure rises to 72% for nurses. The United Kingdom comes second, followed by the <lb/>United States and Canada. These four countries capture more than 98% of the emigration to other OECD <lb/>countries of New Zealand-born health professionals. <lb/>29. <lb/>In comparison to other OECD countries, New Zealand stands out both in terms of immigration <lb/>and emigration.

			<body>23.2% to 28.5%. At the same time, New Zealand also has one of the highest expatriation rates among <lb/>OECD countries, only exceeded by Ireland (see Chart 7). <lb/>30. <lb/>In comparison to the highly skilled in general, it was already pointed out that the share of foreign-<lb/>born tended to be higher amongst health professionals than among the highly skilled group as a whole (see <lb/>Chart 5). Chart 8 compares the expatriation rate of health professionals and of people holding a tertiary <lb/>degree for selected OECD countries around 2000. In the case of New Zealand, the former outstrips the <lb/>latter, meaning that proportionally more doctors and nurses emigrate than other highly skilled workers to <lb/>work in other OECD countries. This is also true for Canada, Finland and Ireland, but not in most other <lb/>OECD countries. <lb/>Chart 8.

Tables <lb/>1 and 2 show that the number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries is equivalent <lb/>to approximately 50% of the number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The results for nurses are <lb/>even more striking, as the number of New Zealand-born nurses living in other OECD countries is almost <lb/>equivalent to the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand. In other words, one could argue that <lb/>immigration replaces on a one to one basis the &quot; lost New Zealand-born nurses &quot; due to emigration. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. HEALTH WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT: TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL <lb/>MOBILITY <lb/>32. <lb/>In New Zealand as in a lot of countries, many factors contribute to shape the health workforce <lb/>and the number of institutional stakeholders involved in policy development is large. In the following, a <lb/>brief overview of recent health care reforms and health workforce planning is presented before focusing on <lb/>education, recruitment and retention policies, with a special focus on the role of international migration. <lb/>2.1 Health Care reforms and health workforce planning <lb/>Health care reforms <lb/>33. <lb/>The New Zealand health system has always remained predominantly publicly funded, mainly <lb/>through taxation. The importance of the role of public funding is emphasised by the Social Security Act <lb/>1938 which marked the introduction of a comprehensive health system that mandated the provision of free <lb/>care for all (French et al., 2001). This law intended to create a national health service, universally <lb/>accessible and state-funded. Hospitals became publicly owned, providing fully subsidized treatment to <lb/>patients. However, medical practitioners insisted on remaining independent and finally succeeded in <lb/>retaining their private status. The Social Security Act has had a strong and long-term influence on the New <lb/>Zealand health system and it was not until the 1980s that major reforms took place. However, the health <lb/>workforce, and in particular the international mobility of health professionals, were not among the main <lb/>priorities of these reforms. Four time periods can be identified for the health reform priorities in New <lb/>Zealand (Easton, 2002; Ashton 2002, 2005; Gauld, 2003). <lb/>! First period: 1983-1992: During the 1970s, there was a perception that the health system was <lb/>becoming increasingly complex and needed reform. Then, in the 1980s, decentralization was <lb/>introduced with the creation of 14 Area Health Boards (AHBs) dealing with health care funding and <lb/>service management. It was expected that the introduction of the Areas Health Boards would allow <lb/>efficiency gains, but health expenditures per capita continued to grow (see Chart 9), particularly <lb/>primary medical care subsidies. The AHBs were initially introduced by the National Government in <lb/>1983, but their role was expanded under the Labour Government (1984-1990) in the context of public <lb/>sector reforms in New Zealand. <lb/>! Second period: 1993-1996: During this period, a market-oriented reform was introduced by the <lb/>National Government (1990-1996). In particular, the purchaser-provider split model was adopted. <lb/>Under this system, purchasers used public funds to contract with competing public and private <lb/>providers for the provision of health services. Purchasers were encouraged to buy services from the <lb/>best value providers. In addition, budgets were integrated for primary and secondary services under one <lb/>purchaser. However, these reforms were not necessarily supported by individuals working in the health <lb/>system and the outcomes failed to match expectations, particularly in terms of securing efficiency gains <lb/>in the hospital sector. <lb/>! Third period 1996-1999: At the end of the 1990s, New Zealand&apos;s first election under proportional <lb/>representation produced a National-led coalition government (1996-1999) which abandoned the idea of <lb/>competition as a main driver for the health system. Instead, the key guiding principle of collaboration <lb/>instead of competition was introduced. <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>! Fourth period: 2000 and onwards: One key element of this restructuring process, under the <lb/>leadership of a Labour led coalition government (2000 up to present), set out in the New Zealand <lb/>Public Health and Disability Act 2000 is the establishment of 21 District Health Boards (DHBs). Each <lb/>DHB is responsible for providing or purchasing health services, including primary care, for the <lb/>residents in its district. The DHBs are financed by the Ministry of Health on the basis of a formula <lb/>accounting for the demographics of each district. The new health system combines centralised and <lb/>decentralised components. While funding has remained centralised—the Ministry of Health is the key <lb/>funding agent in the health system—health needs assessment, planning, provision and purchasing of <lb/>health care are decentralised through the activities of the DHBs. <lb/>In the primary sector, in 2001, the implementation of the Primary Health Care Strategy and the creation <lb/>of Primary Health Organizations (PHOs) was an important change to the largely hospital-centered <lb/>string of reforms over the past 20 years. PHOs are non-profit organizations which contract with DHBs <lb/>to provide a comprehensive set of preventive and treatment services for their enrolled population. The <lb/>first PHOs were formed in 2001 and patient enrolment began in 2002. As of July 2007, there were 82 <lb/>PHOs, covering 3.9 million people, or 97-98% of the New Zealand population. PHOs are funded for <lb/>each person enrolled with them (capitation basis) supplemented with a co-payment via a fee-for-service <lb/>system. In rural areas, due to recruitment difficulties, some DHBs recruit general practitioners (GPs) <lb/>directly and pay them often a very competitive salary. <lb/>Chart 9.

However, the <lb/>restructuring appears to have made little impact on the trends that commonly describe health system <lb/>performance (Ashton, 2002), although it is also likely that the life of each reform was too short to have a <lb/>long-term impact on the health system (Gauld, 2003). <lb/>Health Workforce planning <lb/>35. <lb/>Prior to the adoption of a market-oriented approach in the 90&apos;s, health workforce planning was <lb/>playing an important role. Then, planning became less important, as market mechanisms were believed to <lb/>contribute to health workforce equilibrium. As a result, workforce planning was neglected, as illustrated by <lb/>the dismantling of most of the previous health workforce planning structures and processes. However, by <lb/>the late 1990s and early 2000s, it appeared that these &quot; laissez-faire &quot; arrangements were not working so <lb/>well. Persistent recruitment difficulties, a degraded infrastructure to support health workforce planning and <lb/>development, an inadequate information base in most respects, lack of communication and co-operation <lb/>between stakeholders including between the 21 DHBs (HWAC, 2003b), all contributed to the idea that <lb/></body>

			<body>health workforce planning needed consideration again. As a result, various measures in the field of health <lb/>workforce planning and development were adopted. <lb/>36. <lb/>Special committees were set up to address health workforce issues. One such committee, the <lb/>Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC), was established in 2001 under the New Zealand Public <lb/>Health and Disability Act 2000 in order to advise the Minister of Health on any workforce issues, and also <lb/>to assess independently workforce capacity and foreseeable workforce needs. <lb/>37. <lb/>In addition, specific concerns about the medical workforce, in particular, shortages, reliance on <lb/>overseas-trained doctors, and lack of coordination between the medical education and the health sector, led <lb/>the Health Workforce Advisory Committee to establish a Medical Reference Group 9 . The latter argued the <lb/>case for the idea of self-sufficiency for New Zealand (see Box 2)—its report recommends increasing the <lb/>number of medical graduates—and for workforce planning. It stresses the need for leadership and co-<lb/>ordination of medical workforce development in New Zealand, and proposed the development of a national <lb/>body, with a coordinated planning function and capacity to provide a nationally consistent strategic <lb/>overview of workforce development by aligning health and education policies and funding. <lb/>Box 2. Self-sufficiency for the medical workforce in New Zealand? <lb/>Over the past decade, self-sufficiency for the medical workforce has been advocated by different advisory committees, <lb/>taskforces as well as the Ministry of Health. <lb/> &quot; We believe that the strategic aim should be for New Zealand to be self-sufficient in its production of medical <lb/>practitioners &quot; (Health Workforce Advisory Committee -2006, p. vii) <lb/> &quot; Consideration should be given to New Zealand becoming net self-sufficient for medical graduates &quot; (Ministry of Health, <lb/>2006b, p. 19) <lb/>The workforce taskforce recommends that: <lb/> &quot; The number of medical graduates produced by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves <lb/>towards achieving ongoing self-sufficiency for its medical workforce &quot; (Workforce Taskforce 2007, p.1). This is part of <lb/>the recommendation of the Workforce Taskforce. <lb/>The fact that the idea of &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; has gained importance in New Zealand might be surprising. New Zealand is <lb/>indeed a very open economy and immigration plays an important role in most economic sectors. Advocating for self-<lb/>sufficiency for the medical workforce would mean to recognize a &quot; medical exceptionalism &quot; . In this context, it is not <lb/>totally clear what self-sufficiency means and which policies will ensure it. <lb/>Sources: Health Workforce Advisory Committee (2006), Fit for Purpose and For Practice: Advice to the Minister of Health on the <lb/>Issues Concerning the Medical Workforce in New Zealand, Wellington; Ministry of Health (2006b), Training the medical workforce <lb/>2006 and beyond, MoH, Wellington; Workforce Taskforce (2007), Reshaping Medical Education and Training to Meet the Challenges <lb/>of the 21st Century: A Report to the Ministers of Health and for Tertiary Education from the Workforce Taskforce, Wellington. <lb/>38. <lb/>The Health Workforce Advisory Committee has produced a series of reports addressing health <lb/>workforce issues. However, after six years of existence, some claimed that it did not produce enough real <lb/>practical recommendations for the government. The committee concluded its work in September 2006. <lb/>More recently a Health Workforce Taskforce has been established in order to design more practical plans <lb/>to streamline workforce planning and address issues around training, recruitment and retention of the full <lb/>range of health professionals. <lb/></body>

			<body>39. <lb/>DHBs are also involved in health workforce planning. Initially, medical workforce development <lb/>was largely left to individual employers, mainly each DHB. Then, efforts were undertaken to develop a <lb/>more global and integrated approach. In particular, District Health Boards New Zealand (DHBNZ) 10 , <lb/>which groups all 21 DHBs, aims at coordinating DHB policy and at introducing common approaches in <lb/>terms of recruitment and planning. In 2003, DHBNZ developed an overarching &quot; Workforce Action Plan &quot; , <lb/>which focuses on information, relationships and strategic capability. In 2004/5, DHBNZ developed a <lb/> &quot; Future Workforce Project &quot; focusing on DHB collective priorities and actions for health workforce <lb/>development in the next five years. Eight priorities were identified aiming at nurturing and sustaining the <lb/>workforce or developing workforce capacity. Although, DHBNZ acts more as a facilitator, it has a <lb/>potential to play a greater role in reinforcing coordination between the different stakeholders and in <lb/>insuring workforce development. <lb/>40. <lb/>While health workforce policy has been the object of greater attention in New Zealand over the <lb/>past decade, at the same time, the growing number of stakeholders involved in health workforce policy <lb/>developments has contributed, to a certain extent, to a fragmentation and to some duplication of activities <lb/>in health workforce planning. Furthermore, despite its intrinsic value the role attributed to health workforce <lb/>planning remains an issue of debate (Box 3). <lb/>Box 3. Which role for health workforce planning? <lb/>Health workforce planning is advocated by many to facilitate the attainment of an adequate supply of health personnel <lb/>in order to meet population demand for health. In fact, all OECD countries are involved, to different degrees, in health <lb/>workforce planning activities. <lb/>Indeed, there are also a number of relevant reasons, related to health labor market particularities and complexities, <lb/>explaining why public intervention in health workforce management can be of social value. One important reason is <lb/>that medical education is expensive and an oversupply of medical doctors does generate a significant social cost. <lb/>Another reason is the time lag in medical education. Supply adjustment for medical doctors is not immediate as it can <lb/>take up to 10 or more to train a medical specialist. Such lags may cause cycles of alternate shortages and surpluses of <lb/>health workforce, in particular doctors. Specific policies, for instance through various set of incentives, can play a major <lb/>role in minimizing the cyclical imbalances in the health labour market. But planning health labour supply is not an easy <lb/>task and no single country has found the key to solving disparities between health workforce supply and demand <lb/>(Kolars, 2001). <lb/>First, fixing numerical limits essentially supposes a solid capacity to anticipate future demand. This seldom proves to <lb/>be an easy task and there are many examples of prophecies of shortages or over-supply which never materialise. <lb/>Uncertainties related to future population health needs and technological progress, as well as methodological <lb/>sensitivity, contribute to weaken forecasting exercises. As a result, health workforce planning may mainly serve as a <lb/>broad-brush tool. <lb/>Also, while workforce planning could represent a promising area to consider the dynamic between domestic training <lb/>and international recruitment, this is rarely the case. In the United Kingdom, the period from 1999 to 2005 was one of <lb/>unprecedented staffing growth for the NHS in England, fuelled by the availability of significant growth in funding which <lb/>resulted in increasing international recruitment and enhanced domestic training capacity. However, financial deficits <lb/>emerged in the NHS from 2004-05 onwards, attributed, in part at least, to the costs of workforce expansion (House of <lb/>Commons, Health Committee, 2007). The deficits have, in turn driven a sudden downturn in workforce size. This <lb/>situation has exposed a disconnection between financial planning and workforce planning. It also shows, to some <lb/>extent, the lack of coordination between migration and domestic training polices as a larger numbers of UK based <lb/>graduates have more difficulties entering the health care labour market (Buchan, 2007). <lb/>Sources: Buchan J. (2007), UK case study, forthcoming; Kolars J. (2001) Forecasting physician supply and demand, Medical <lb/>Education 35(5), 424-425. <lb/>10 <lb/>DHBNZ was formed by all 21 District Health Boards in December 2000 to provide a sector group through <lb/>which DHBs could coordinate their activities at a national level. The overall purpose of DHBNZ is to assist <lb/>DHBs in meeting their objectives. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2 Education policies and recognition of foreign qualification <lb/>41. <lb/>Decisions about the number and the type of health workers trained are critical and affect the <lb/>development of the health workforce. In addition, in the context of New Zealand, given the importance of <lb/>foreign-trained health workers, it is important to have a good understanding of the condition of their <lb/>insertion in the health workforce. In the following, medical and nursing education pathways will be <lb/>examined, as well as the process for the recognition of foreign qualifications. <lb/>Medical Education <lb/>42. <lb/>Undergraduate medical education in New Zealand spans six years and is provided by two <lb/>universities, Auckland and Otago (MoH, 2006b). This is followed by pre-vocational training that lasts two <lb/>years (PGY 1, PGY 2) or more. It corresponds to a transitional period into professional practice, <lb/>recognised with a registration in a general scope of practice with the Medical Council. Then, once a choice <lb/>for a specific area of medicine is made, vocational training needs to be completed in order to be recognised <lb/>by the relevant Medical College. The last phase lasts between three years for general practice to eight years <lb/>for some hospital specialties (see Annex 2) <lb/>43. <lb/>Various actors are involved in the funding of medical education in New Zealand. Funding is <lb/>mainly provided by the Education Ministry through the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), by the <lb/>Ministry of Health through the Clinical Training Agency (CTA), and by the DHBs. While medical <lb/>education until graduation is funded by the TEC, the internship (1 or 2 years) and the postgraduate training <lb/>are mainly funded by the CTA. To a lesser extent, DHBs also play a role in postgraduate training. In 2002, <lb/>it was estimated that 121 million NZ$ (1US$ = 2.16 NZ$, 2002) was spent on medical education and <lb/>clinical training (MoH, 2006b). While TEC expenses on undergraduate education represented 43 million <lb/>NZ$, CTA expenditures on clinical training represented 62.9 million NZ$, and DHBs expenditures 15 <lb/>million NZ$. There seems to be some lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the <lb/>Ministry of Health. Some claim that there is a lack of global vision for medical education, and argue, for <lb/>instance, that there is a mismatch between the number of available vocational positions (funded by the <lb/>Ministry of Health) and the actual number of medical students starting vocational training (the number of <lb/>medical students is determined by the Ministry of Education). <lb/>44. <lb/>A recent report by the Health Workforce Taskforce (March 2007) emphasises, among other <lb/>things, (i) the need for further cooperation in the field of education and training of medical practitioners <lb/>through the creation of a Medical Training Board and (ii) that &quot; the number of medical graduates produced <lb/>by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves towards achieving ongoing self-<lb/>sufficiency for its medical workforce &quot; . <lb/>45. <lb/>One major characteristic of the medical education system that New Zealand shares with other <lb/>OECD countries is the capped system on funded places for domestic students. The intake of first-year <lb/>students is currently fixed at 325 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The government quota has been <lb/>lifted twice in the past 20 years. In 1987, the intake at Otago was lifted from 150 to 170 students, and again <lb/>in 2004, to 190. The University of Auckland had its quota raised from 115 to the current figure of 135 in <lb/>2004 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The increase in the quotas in 2004 aimed at allowing more <lb/>students from rural areas in medical schools. In addition to the 325 domestic students, about 30-40 <lb/>international students are admitted each year. These students pay the full cost of their studies, which <lb/>represents a source of revenue for the University. These students mainly come from the Middle East and <lb/>most are funded by their government. Most students return to their country after graduation, despite the <lb/>fact that for foreign-born medical students completing their degree in New Zealand, it would be relatively <lb/>easy to stay on a permanent basis in New Zealand. <lb/></body>

			<body>46. <lb/>Between 1986 and 2006, the number of medical graduates increased from 228 to 322 per year <lb/>(see Chart 10).Most of the jump in the number of graduates occurred post 1990, presumably a lagged effect <lb/>of the first relaxation of the numerus clausus rule in the late 1980s. Presumably, the second relaxation in <lb/>2004 will see a further jump in the number of graduates from 2010 on. New Zealand tends to have lower <lb/>graduation rates than most OECD countries. While the average graduation rate per 100 000 population in <lb/>New Zealand is estimated at 7.9 between 1995 and 2004, the corresponding figure for the OECD amounted <lb/>to approximately 9.4 (OECD, 2006). For New Zealand, a graduation rate of 9.4 per 100 000 population <lb/>would correspond to 365 graduates per year, as compared to the average of 305 between 1995 and 2004 <lb/>(see Chart 11)—equivalent in a steady-state (and assuming no attrition) to a 12% increase in the current <lb/>annual intake to medical schools. <lb/>Chart 10.

Indeed, recruitment and retention <lb/>problems within academic medicine are common. This persistent problem is largely attributed to higher <lb/>salaries proposed by DHBs. Salary gaps in 2005 between university health professionals involved in <lb/>medical education and health professionals employed by DHBs to deliver health services were estimated at <lb/>between 30 and 60 000 NZ$ (1US$ = 1.42 NZ$, 2005) (MoH, 2006b). However, the recent wage increases <lb/>in favour of faculty members should contribute to ease such recruitment and retention difficulties. <lb/>48. <lb/>Although medical education is largely subsidized by the government for domestic students, the <lb/>increasing indebtedness of students is a source of widespread concern and discussion (HWAC, 2005; <lb/>Moore et al., 2006a; Pole, 2006), and is thought to play a role in the choice of the medical specialty and <lb/>even in out-migration. <lb/>49. <lb/>The cost of undergraduate medical education in 2002 was estimated at 199 000 NZ$, of which <lb/>71% is met by the Government and 29% by the student (MoH, 2006b). This represents about 10 000 NZ$ <lb/>per year. As a result, students usually take out a loan in order to pay the fees and to cover their living <lb/>expenses. At the end of their studies, they may end up with a large debt, about 70-80 000 NZ$ for doctors <lb/>and even more for dentists. <lb/>50. <lb/>Moore et al. (2006b) found that indebtedness was a key element for those considering emigration <lb/>to Australia or to other countries where wages are higher, so that they can reimburse their debt more easily. <lb/>Student indebtedness is also said to play an important role in the choice of medical specialty. For a <lb/>substantial number of medical graduates, debt was one of the main factors explaining the lack of <lb/>attractiveness of work areas like general practice, public health and psychiatry. <lb/>51. <lb/>The debt issue is abundantly debated and various measures have been adopted to address this <lb/>concern. They include the introduction by the government of a capped rate of student loan interest at 7% in <lb/>an effort to give greater certainty to students, the institution of a &quot; step-up scholarship &quot; that provides a <lb/></body>

			<body>significant subsidy to tuition fees, and more recently, an interest write-off for graduates choosing to stay in <lb/>New Zealand (Pole, 2006). However, at the same time, those efforts are partially off-set by the Universities <lb/>continual increase of medical fees. Policies of writing off interest for students are also criticised by some <lb/>who claim that it does not represent an efficient allocation of public resources and might encourage more <lb/>borrowing and slower repayment. <lb/>Nursing and midwifery education <lb/>52. <lb/>In contrast to medical education, the number of places in nursing and midwifery schools is <lb/>demand-driven although the availability of clinical placements has constrained enrolments. However, from <lb/>2008, the demand-driven system will be replaced by a global budget system under which each University <lb/>will submit a budget proposal to the TEC. <lb/>53. <lb/>Registered nurses in New Zealand, the largest nursing category, are educated via a three-year <lb/>Bachelor of Nursing degree. There are 16 educational institutions offering programs leading to <lb/>registration 11 . Due to this relatively large number of nursing educational institutions and the low number of <lb/>students, in particular in rural areas, concern about the average quality of nursing training programmes has <lb/>been expressed in New Zealand. However, closing nursing programmes in rural areas is seen as difficult, <lb/>since it is likely to make rural recruitment more difficult. <lb/>54. <lb/>By contrast to medical graduates, over the past decade, the number of nursing graduates has <lb/>decreased, from 1 485 in 1996 to 1 206 in 2004. The number of nursing graduates per 100 000 population <lb/>is slightly below the OECD average, 31.8 per 100 000 population in New Zealand against 32.8 for the <lb/>OECD (see charts 12 and 13). <lb/>Chart 12.

Enrolled Nurses were <lb/>educated in employer-based programmes under the Nurses Act 1977. However, these programmes were <lb/>discontinued by health boards in 1993. The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 (Box 4) <lb/>saw the reinstatement of a second-level nursing programme in educational institutions under a new scope <lb/>of practice and title, Nurse Assistant. Since 2004, the Enrolled Nurse scope of practice has not been open <lb/>for new applicants.Applicants from that date are registered as Nurse Assistants. There are approximately <lb/>3 800 Enrolled Nurses in New Zealand (New Zealand Health Information Service, 2004). Enrolled Nurses <lb/>work under the direction of a Registered Nurse or Midwife. The responsibilities of Enrolled Nurses include <lb/>assisting patients with the activities of daily living and performing delegated interventions from the nursing <lb/>or midwifery care plan. <lb/>56. <lb/>Currently, there are about 135 nurse assistants in New Zealand (North, personal communication, <lb/>2007). Nurse assistants represent a &quot; second-tier person &quot; working under the supervision of a registered <lb/>nurse or midwife in a range of areas. They deliver nursing care to individuals in community, residential <lb/>and hospital settings. To become a nurse assistant, it is compulsory to follow a program length of 1000 <lb/>hours, with the students required to complete a minimum of 350 hours theory and 650 hours practice. <lb/>Nurse Assistants are prepared in polytechnic institutes. There are three nurse assistant programmes in New <lb/>Zealand with further programmes under consideration 12 . <lb/>57. <lb/>Another new category is that of Nurse Practitioner. Legislation establishing Nurse Practitioner <lb/>was enacted in September 2005. Nurse practitioners have an expanded nursing role in clinical settings. In <lb/>addition, they have developed the skills and knowledge to expand their role to include tasks that may have <lb/>been &apos;traditionally&apos; performed by other health professionals, such as prescribing medications and ordering <lb/>diagnostic tests (Nursing Council, 2006). There are only about 40 individuals practising as Nurse <lb/>Practitioners within New Zealand. To become a nurse practitioner, one should be on the nursing register, <lb/>have a minimum of four years of experience in a specific area of practice, have a Masters Degree, and have <lb/>12 <lb/>Northland Polytechnic (aged care) and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (long term and <lb/>rehabilitation care). <lb/></body>

			<body>passed the Nursing Council assessment of Nurse Practitioner competencies and criteria. There are six <lb/>master programmes to become a Nurse Practitioner in New Zealand and there is an education equivalences <lb/>process available to those who have not undertaken one of these approved programmes 13 . <lb/>58. <lb/>As for midwifery, pre-registration education is through a three-year Bachelor of Midwifery <lb/>programme. There are five pre-registration midwifery programmes in New Zealand 14 . Students are mainly <lb/>direct entry (i.e. with no previous health profession education). However, a midwife may also be a <lb/>registered general and obstetric or comprehensive nurse who has undertaken further education to gain <lb/>midwifery qualifications. Midwifery students who hold a previous nursing registration or those with other <lb/>degrees or other relevant experience are likely to gain credit under these policies and complete a shorter <lb/>programme (New Zealand College of Midwives, 2006). <lb/>Box 4: The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 <lb/>Health professionals are regulated professions and registration is essential to practise. A new approach towards <lb/>health profession regulation was adopted with the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance (HPCA) Act 2003 <lb/>which came into effect in 2004. While the main purpose of the Act is to protect the public from harm and applies only to <lb/>those practitioners where there is a risk of harm, this act differs from previous legislations. The main differences are <lb/>the extension of the ongoing competency requirements, which applied previously to only the medical profession, to <lb/>other regulated professions; a certification regime for all professions which allows for flexibility in the overall health <lb/>workforce; the delegation to the registration authorities of all clinical decision-making to allow them to respond to <lb/>changing circumstances without the need for legislative change; the introduction of scopes of practice to allow the <lb/>development of new roles; and the separation of the registration function from the disciplinary function. The HPCA Act <lb/>applies to all registered health practitioners including medical practitioners (doctors, surgeons and other specialists), <lb/>dentists, midwives, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, podiatrists and psychologists. <lb/>Under the HPCA act, &apos;scopes of practice&apos; are used to describe the tasks performed by a professional group, <lb/>instead of &quot; areas of specialty &quot; as was previously the case. For instance, under the HPCA, the previous nursing <lb/>registers have been replaced by four scopes of practice: registered nurse, nurse practitioner, nurse assistant and <lb/>enrolled nurse. As mentioned earlier, enrolled nurses who graduated before 2000 keep their previous title, but those <lb/>educated after 2000 have the title of nurse assistant. The act also established the separate Midwifery Council (from the <lb/>Nursing Council) which has jurisdiction over the education, registration, discipline and competence of all midwives in <lb/>New Zealand. <lb/>A review of the operation of the Act is underway to identify implementation issues requiring any further changes. <lb/>Source: <lb/>Nursing <lb/>Scope <lb/>of <lb/>Practice <lb/>under <lb/>the <lb/>Health <lb/>Practitioners <lb/>Competence <lb/>Assurance <lb/>Act, <lb/>2004 <lb/>(http://www.nurse.org.nz/leadership/ls_global_shortage.htm; Nursing Council of New Zealand, Scope of practice, <lb/>http://www.nursingcouncil.org.nz/scopes.html <lb/>Recognition of foreign-medical qualifications <lb/>59. <lb/>Overseas health professionals must meet both the immigration requirements set by the <lb/>immigration services and the registration requirements set by professional bodies.

			<body>time, New Zealand was keen to attract skilled and highly qualified people and passing the minimum-point <lb/>threshold for immigration gave an automatic right to settle in New Zealand. However, despite being <lb/>granted residence on the basis of their qualifications, a number of highly skilled individuals, including <lb/>doctors, did not meet standards set down by the relevant professional bodies in order to practise in New <lb/>Zealand. Hence, highly skilled permanent immigrants faced increasing difficulties in finding jobs which <lb/>matched their qualification and foreign work experience. <lb/>60. <lb/>In 1995, the policy for skilled migrants was refined, with increased emphasis on the <lb/>transferability of human capability to New Zealand, via for example, qualification recognition, English-<lb/>language ability, etc. As a result, even if requirements are separate, there is now a more harmonized <lb/>approach between the immigration and registration process. In most of cases, eligibility for registration or <lb/>registration is required in order to qualify for skilled immigration. The sequence in general is as follows for <lb/>health professionals wanting to work in New Zealand: be eligible for registration or be registered, have a <lb/>job offer, obtain a work or residency permit. Most of the time, eligibility for registration is also a pre-<lb/>requisite for the work or residency permit. However, registration is not a pre-requisite for individuals <lb/>migrating to New Zealand through the family or the international humanitarian stream. Available evidence <lb/>suggests that few humanitarian immigrants have medical qualifications, although the situation is less clear <lb/>for nursing. <lb/>61. <lb/>The New Zealand Censuses of Population and Dwelling show that employment rates of people <lb/>aged 15-64 with post school qualifications in the medical field (results are similar for nursing and <lb/>midwifery studies) tend to have high employment rates but that people born in Asia and those originating <lb/>from non-English-speaking European countries face more difficulties to integrate in the labour market <lb/>(Chart 14). Part of the discrepancy may be due to difficulties in getting qualifications recognised, but more <lb/>in-depth studies would be needed here to ascertain this point. In any case the improvements recorded <lb/>between 2001 and 2006 may reveal that this is less of an issue than it was in the past. <lb/>62. <lb/>The Medical Council of New Zealand is responsible for the registration of doctors in New <lb/>Zealand. Getting registered can be done via several routes depending on the country in which the medical <lb/>degree was obtained, previous work experience and purpose of the stay (Box 5). The first pre-requisite is to <lb/>meet English-language requirements, as determined by the International English Language Testing System <lb/>(IELTS). Individuals graduated in the United Kingdom or Ireland and with one-year of clinical experience <lb/>can get provisional general registration. For individuals who graduated in other countries, a pass in <lb/>USMLE 15 steps one and two is required to prove medical knowledge. Furthermore, they must also pass the <lb/>New Zealand registration examination (the NZREX clinical) to demonstrate clinical ability. Provisional <lb/>registration can also be obtained by individuals who worked continuously for at least three years in a health <lb/>system considered as comparable 16 . As for vocational registration, it applies for individuals with training <lb/>and experience as a specialist overseas. <lb/>15 <lb/>United States Medical Licensing Examination. <lb/>16 <lb/>Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Republic of <lb/>Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 5. Type of medical registration <lb/>Provisional general: All new registrants, regardless of seniority, must work under supervision for at least their first 12 <lb/>months in New Zealand to become familiar with the culture. During this time they are registered within a provisional <lb/>general scope of practice and their performance will be assessed by senior colleagues. They will be required to <lb/>complete certain requirements to be registered within a general scope. The only exception to this supervised period is <lb/>for New Zealand and Australian graduates who have already completed their internship in Australia. <lb/>General: A doctor who has completed the requirements of a provisional general scope will be registered within a <lb/>general scope of practice. Examples are junior doctors who have completed their first post-graduate year and may be <lb/>in vocational training, doctors who have not started, or have chosen not to do, vocational training, or doctors nearing <lb/>retirement who no longer meet the requirements for registration within a vocational scope of practice. The doctor must <lb/>establish a professional collegial relationship with another doctor who is registered within the same or related <lb/>vocational scope, and must participate in appropriate continuing professional development to maintain and improve <lb/>competence and to be recertified each year. <lb/>Provisional vocational: Doctors who have completed their vocational training and who are not already registered in <lb/>New Zealand must work under supervision for at least 12 months. They are registered within a provisional vocational <lb/>scope of practice. During this time they must complete Council&apos;s requirements for registration in a vocational scope. <lb/>Those requirements may include working in a formal assessment position and/or passing an examination. <lb/>Vocational: A doctor who has completed his or her vocational training as a consultant and has appropriate <lb/>qualifications and experience can be registered within a vocational scope of practice. These vocational scopes are <lb/>recognised by the medical Council. A doctor registered in a vocational scope must participate in an approved <lb/>continuing professional development programme to maintain competence and be recertified each year. <lb/>Special purpose scope: A doctor who satisfies the registration criteria to visit New Zealand for one of the following <lb/>defined and specific reasons will be registered within a special purpose scope of practice: i.e. as a visiting expert; as a <lb/>sponsored trainee; for post-graduate training and/or experience; as a medical researcher; as a locum specialist <lb/>working in New Zealand for less than six months; to help in an emergency, or for any other reason approved by <lb/>Council. <lb/>These doctors will be required to work under supervision for the duration of their employment or appointment. This <lb/>&apos;special purpose&apos; scope of practice is not a pathway to permanent registration. <lb/>Source: New Zealand Medical Council <lb/>63. <lb/>The Nursing Council of New Zealand is responsible for the recognition of qualifications of <lb/>foreign-educated nurses. The main principles governing registration include that the applicant has <lb/>undertaken a nursing programme that is similar in all specified content and length to the equivalent <lb/>programme in New Zealand, and is able to speak and write in the English language when English is not the <lb/>applicant&apos;s first language. Tests recognised by the Nursing Council are CGNFS, IELTS, and OET. As <lb/>international recruitment is regulated by both immigration and registration proceedings, the registration <lb/>process can also be used to facilitate or discourage immigration. For instance, the required minimum level <lb/>for the IELTS has been raised: a score of not less than 7 in each of the four sections of the exam is now <lb/>required instead of an overall average 7 previously. As a result, registration is more difficult for overseas <lb/>nurses. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for nursing registration may be required to undergo <lb/>further training within a New Zealand educational institution. <lb/>2.3 National and international recruitment <lb/>64. <lb/>Although there has been a substantial increase in the number of health workers over the past <lb/>decades in New Zealand, the increasing dependency on foreign health worker is fuelling concerns on <lb/>health worker shortages. <lb/></body>

			<body>Estimating—and responding to—shortages of health personnel <lb/>65. <lb/>Whether or not a shortage of health workers exists is a critical question but the answer to this <lb/>question tends to vary according to the approaches adopted or to the stakeholder perspective. Nonetheless, <lb/>it is commonly agreed that difficulties do prevail in recruiting nurses and medical practitioners, in <lb/>particular for some medical and nursing specialties, and more generally, in rural areas. <lb/>66. <lb/>One tool to evaluate and monitor shortages is the Job Vacancy Monitor (JVM) system of the <lb/>Department of Labour (Box 6). The JVM is a monthly analysis of job advertisements published in selected <lb/>newspapers. Their assessment of occupations for 2006 indicate that skill shortages for health professionals <lb/>(excluding nurses and midwives) remain severe with only 41% of advertised vacancies being filled <lb/>(Department of Labour, 2007). Nurses and midwives moved out of the extreme shortage category in 2006, <lb/>but remain difficult for employers to find, with a little over half the advertised vacancies being filled. On <lb/>this basis, it was considered that there is not a genuine shortage of individuals with the required skills in <lb/>nursing despite employers having considerable difficulty filling vacancies for nurses and midwives <lb/>(Department of Labour, 2005b). Recently, there has been a slight easing of the health labour market: JVM <lb/>data recorded a decline of 12% in advertised vacancies between 2005 and 2006 for the highly skilled in the <lb/>health sector (Department of Labour, 2006) 17 . However, skill shortages appear to be chronic for some <lb/>specialities like anaesthetics, radiology, obstetrics, and psychiatric nurses. <lb/>Box 6. Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme <lb/>The Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme is designed to provide new insights into skill shortages in New Zealand. It <lb/>aims to identify which skilled occupations are in shortage, and to better understand the supply and demand forces <lb/>contributing to these shortages. The programme currently consists of three components: <lb/>Job Vacancy Monitor: a monthly analysis of job advertisements appearing in 25 daily newspapers and two IT internet <lb/>job boards. This component started from November 2002. <lb/>A Survey of Employers who have Recently Advertised (SERA), with two sub-components: <lb/>SERA Extensive: a large sample survey of employers to establish whether the advertised positions were filled, and <lb/>the number and suitability of applicants. <lb/>SERA Intensive: an in-depth survey of a small number of employers who advertised vacancies in occupations in <lb/>shortage to gain an understanding of the forces contributing to the shortage. <lb/>Occupation reports: The results of the SERA surveys are analysed together with other data sources to form a series of <lb/>occupational reports, produced on an annual basis. <lb/>Source: Department of Labour, http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/jvm/ <lb/>67. <lb/>DHBs which employ the majority of health professionals in New Zealand play a key role in <lb/>recruitment. Until recently, each DHB was recruiting on its own, creating some competition between them, <lb/>and leading to some inefficiency in the recruitment process from a national perspective. Common <lb/>approaches of recruitment between DHBs are now favored, especially for international recruitment. For <lb/>17 <lb/>There are, however, a number of limitations in using vacancy data. In general, vacancy rates may <lb/>understate the extent of shortages. There may be &quot; suppressed &quot; vacancies (where a post is not advertised <lb/>because management has no expectation of successful recruitment), and &quot; hidden &quot; vacancies (where a post <lb/>is filled, but by an individual with insufficient skills or experience to successfully meet the requirements of <lb/>the job). In addition, there seems to be room for more collaboration between the Department of Labour and <lb/>the Ministry of Health (and other institutions involved in health workforce planning) regarding the <lb/>identification of health worker shortages. <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>instance, efforts are developing to better share information on health personnel needs across DHBs or by <lb/>pooling resources for recruitment, and also to develop a brand in order to facilitate global recruitment for <lb/>New Zealand. Recruitment agencies are not playing a significant role for international recruitment in New <lb/>Zealand, but the Department of Labour has a Relationship Management Team aiming at organising expos <lb/>and recruitment campaigns abroad. <lb/>68. <lb/>Among the policies to improve recruitment, remuneration and financial incentives are among the <lb/>most common. Information on the employment status of doctors and nurses indicates that the average wage <lb/>in medicine in 2001 was 62 000 NZ$ (Maré and Liang, 2006). The mean income in the field of medicine is <lb/>comparable in New Zealand with accounting and law and legal studies. <lb/>69. <lb/>Until 2000, every hospital would negotiate individually with their employees. Now, health <lb/>workers employed by DHBs have common contracts through the Multi-Employer Collective Agreement <lb/>(MECA). As the wage has been aligned on the Auckland DHB MECA, most doctors and nurses have seen <lb/>their wage increased, except those in Auckland. Medical specialists have also benefited from wage <lb/>increases due to the competition between DHBs to recruit them. As for nurses, they have benefited recently <lb/>from a substantial wage increase. However, most international studies investigating the labour supply <lb/>decisions of nurses tend to find that, at least in the short-run, nursing labour supply appears to be fairly <lb/>unresponsive to wage change (Shield, 2004; Chiha and Link, 2003; Antonazzo et al., 2003). In other <lb/>words, an increase in the wage does not necessarily lead to a substantial increase in labour participation in <lb/>the short-run. <lb/>70. <lb/>Another type of approach to address potential shortages is through the development of a flexible <lb/>workforce in New Zealand. In particular, as noted above, the use of nurse practitioners has been <lb/>encouraged but this promising initiative is still in its infancy since only 40 nurse practitioners have been <lb/>trained so far, and not all are in employment which fully used their training and skills. <lb/>International recruitments: immigration policy as a management tool of the health workforce? <lb/>71. <lb/>In terms of international recruitment of health workers, New Zealand has no specific migration <lb/>programmes. Health professional migration policy is defined in the context of skilled migration. However, <lb/>for those professions listed on shortage occupation lists which include most health professions, <lb/>immigration is facilitated. The fact that shortage occupation lists are used in immigration policy illustrates <lb/>that health workforce concerns are integrated, to a certain extent, in the immigration policy. <lb/>72. <lb/>Immigration plays an important role in building New Zealand society. The proportion of foreign-<lb/>born population in New Zealand is one of the highest among OECD countries, at 19.4% in 2005 (OECD, <lb/>2007). Over the past 20 years, the number of individuals migrating to New Zealand has increased and <lb/>diversified. While Europe and Australia still represent the main source countries, Asia is playing a bigger <lb/>role. <lb/>73. <lb/>New Zealand immigration policy has undergone various changes. Major changes in the selective <lb/>migration policy were introduced, notably in 1995, which aimed at better taking into account language <lb/>proficiency, implementing recognition of qualifications and prioritizing those with a job offer. In recent <lb/>years, the usual distinction between temporary and permanent migrants was questioned. As a result, the <lb/>principles and the procedure governing the permanent migration program were amended to give priority to <lb/>people with New Zealand experience and qualifications, creating bridges between temporary and <lb/>permanent programs. These changes have had a significant impact on the ability of foreign students to stay <lb/>in New Zealand after graduation. In 2005, about 30% of those who entered with a temporary permit in <lb/>2002 gained permanent residence in New Zealand (DoL, The Migration Trend, 2006). <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 <lb/></note>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>74. <lb/>The number and composition of permanent residence migration inflow is set annually with regard <lb/>to a range of factors, including the impact of a given level of approval on the economy, social cohesion and <lb/>infrastructure, and the desirability of stability (New Zealand High Commission, 2003). In 2005/6, around <lb/>52 000 people were approved for permanent New Zealand residence. Basically there are three entry routes <lb/>to permanent migration to New Zealand: (i) Skilled/Business, (ii) Family Sponsored and (iii) International <lb/>Humanitarian. <lb/>75. <lb/>The Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) represents the main path to residence, as over half of all <lb/>people approved in 2005/6 gained residence through this category. To be eligible in the skilled migration <lb/>category, one must be under 55 years old and score at least 100 points in their Expression of Interest <lb/>(people with 140 points or more are automatically selected). 18 Additional points are given to occupations, <lb/>recognised prior to arrival, that are included in the Long-Term Skill Shortage List (LTSSL) (Box 7). This <lb/>list includes almost all health occupations. Additional bonus points are also granted for an employment <lb/>offer for the regions outside Auckland, and for work experience in New Zealand. In 2005/06, 220 doctors <lb/>and 780 nurses entered through the Skill Migrant Category. Figures for the previous year were respectively <lb/>320 and 920 (see Annex 3). <lb/>Box 7. Occupational Shortage Lists <lb/>The Department of Labour currently maintains two occupational shortage lists: the Immediate Skill Shortage List <lb/>(ISSL), formerly the Occupational Shortage List (OSL) and the Long-Term Skill Shortage List (LTSSL), formerly the <lb/>Priority Occupation List (POL). The ISSL and the LTSSL are reviewed biannually by the Department of Labour. During <lb/>the review, submissions are sought from industry groups about both the nature and extent of skill shortages in their <lb/>area. <lb/>The ISSL Skill Shortage List contains professions which are currently in high demand in New Zealand and lists the <lb/>qualifications and /or experience required for work permits and the recommended standard for work permit applicants <lb/>with an offer of employment. <lb/>The LTSS List contains professions which are currently in extraordinarily high demand in New Zealand and lists the <lb/>qualifications and /or experience required for residence permits and bonus points under the Skilled Migrant Category <lb/>From an employer&apos;s point of view, the occupation shortage lists obviate the need to demonstrate that there is no New <lb/>Zealand citizen or resident available suitably qualified by training and experience to do the job offered. Therefore, once <lb/>a job has been offered to a potential employee, the person will be able to obtain a work visa or permit provided that <lb/>they have the recognized skills and qualifications. <lb/>76. <lb/>As for temporary migration, one important category for health professionals is the &quot; Work to <lb/>Residence &quot; , which allows getting a work visa as a step towards gaining permanent residence. A major <lb/>entry route for the &quot; Work to Residence &quot; is the &quot; Talent Program &quot; . It includes the case of a person with a job <lb/>offer from an accredited employer (most DHBs are accredited employers) and listed on the LTSSL. In this <lb/>situation the employer can recruit directly from abroad for a period up to two years renewable and <lb/>transferable to a permanent permit. A person with a job offer which is included in the ISSL (most medical <lb/>occupations are also included in this list) can get the same type of work permit without having to pass a <lb/>labour market test. In other cases, the employer must demonstrate that there are no suitably qualified <lb/>and/or experienced New Zealand citizens or residents available to do the job. In 2005/06, there were about <lb/>1 470 work applications approved for medical doctors and 1 060 for nurses. The latter is on the decrease as <lb/>18 <lb/>All individuals meeting the criteria are then pooled and ranked according to specific selection criteria. <lb/>People who score between 100 and 140 points and have a job or job offer in New Zealand will be selected <lb/>in sufficient number to meet the New Zealand Immigration Programme numbers. However, not all eligible <lb/>individuals in the pool will necessarily be invited to apply for residence. Individuals who are not invited to <lb/>apply for residence remain in the pool for three months. If they are not selected after this period, they can <lb/>lodge a new Expression of Interest. <lb/></body>

			<body>compared to previous years (1 350 in 2004 and 1 630 in 2003) while the former is mostly stable (see <lb/>Annex 3). <lb/>77. <lb/>Finally, another entry route is the &quot; Working Holiday Scheme &quot; . This program is for individuals <lb/>aged between 18 and 30 years who aim to experience life in New Zealand (about 28 500 persons were <lb/>granted this type of visa in 2005/06). People entering through this route are able to work for part of their <lb/>total permit duration whose maximum period is two years. There are about 25 bilateral agreements with <lb/>origin countries for this program which is capped except for the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, the <lb/>Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. It seems that some medical doctors, notably from the United Kingdom, <lb/>enter through this route, mainly for temporary stay. <lb/>78. <lb/>In New Zealand, international recruitment of health workers is important as illustrated on a long <lb/>period by registration data 19 . It accounted for over 80% of annual registrations of doctors over the period <lb/>2002-2005, and over 50% of all nursing registrations (New Zealand Medical Council, 2006; New Zealand <lb/>Nursing Council, 2006). The annual number of overseas registrations of medical practitioners rose from <lb/>452 in 1990 to 1 414 in 2005. <lb/>79. <lb/>Over time, the main source countries have remained relatively similar, with the exception of <lb/>South Africa. For the latter, there has been a large increase in medical migration, especially in 1995, which <lb/>was associated with the end of Apartheid. However, concern expressed about the brain drain by the South <lb/>African authorities has led to a decrease in active recruitment from South Africa thereafter. More <lb/>generally, concern about the impact of migration on lower income source countries has led New Zealand to <lb/>sign the Commonwealth Code of Practice for the International Recruitment of Health Workers. <lb/>Chart 15.

At the same time, new <lb/>source countries are emerging. There has been a significant increase in the yearly registration of Filipino-<lb/>trained nurses in recent years (from around 50 in 2000 to 150 in 2005). Also, registration from nurses <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">19 <lb/>The registration figures should, however, be considered with caution as they cannot necessarily be equated <lb/>to the number of doctors or nurses entering the country at a point in time. <lb/></note>

			<body>trained in India and Zimbabwe has become more important. While almost no registrations were recorded in <lb/>New Zealand from nurses trained in India and Zimbabwe in 2000, registrations from each of these <lb/>countries reached 100 in 2005. By contrast, yearly registrations from nurses trained in South Africa have <lb/>significantly diminished (from 200 in 2001 to around 50 in 2005). <lb/>81. <lb/>Over time, there has been an increasing use of temporary migration which has given rise to a <lb/>large number of short-term stays of health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. For instance, <lb/>temporary registration 20 for medical doctors rose from 165 in 1990 to 758 in 2003 (HWAC, 2005). <lb/>82. <lb/>A number of short stays are doctors coming for a locum in rural areas. In rural areas, where <lb/>recruitment difficulties are particularly notable, especially for general practitioners, special programs have <lb/>been developed. For instance, the New Zealand Rural General Practice Network, a not-for-profit society, is <lb/>representing the interests of rural general practice and, in particular, the rural health workforce. It <lb/>developed to help the recruitment for long-term services or for short-term locum services in rural areas. In <lb/>particular, the locum program is rather successful in helping to replace doctors when they are on <lb/>continuous training or on holiday. <lb/>2.4 Retention and emigration <lb/>83. <lb/>Retention is also a critical element in health workforce policy as staff turnover has a cost. <lb/>Moreover, in the context of New Zealand, as mentioned before, emigration is significant, particularly to <lb/>Australia and the United Kingdom, and thus retention and return migration is an important issue. <lb/>Retention and turnover in the workforce <lb/>84. <lb/>For nurses, turnover across DHBs is estimated to range between 12% and 25% (North et al., <lb/>2006a). Higher turnover occurs in DHBs in metropolitan areas, areas where there is high competition for <lb/>nurses, and in certain clinical areas such as mental health and emergency services. North et al. (2006b) <lb/>estimated at 19 900 NZ$ the cost per nurse leaver, and between 5 000 NZ$ and 13 000 NZ$ the costs <lb/>associated with recruitment, hiring and training. <lb/>85. <lb/>In order to improve retention in the job, efforts have been engaged to address working conditions <lb/>through, for example, the development of &quot; magnet hospitals &quot; in New Zealand. Internationally, it has been <lb/>observed that some policies in place in hospitals are more successful in recruiting and retaining health care <lb/>staff. These hospitals have been designated as &quot; magnet hospitals &quot; . Research shows superior outcomes for <lb/>magnet hospitals, such as lower risk-adjusted hospital mortality, higher ratings of quality of care, higher <lb/>patient satisfaction, lower rates of nurse burnout and higher rates of nurse job satisfaction. It appears that <lb/>developing some of the features of a &quot; magnet hospital &quot; is certainly a promising strategy to improve <lb/>retention. Becoming a magnet hospital requires meeting 14 principles including having strong nursing <lb/>leadership, a flat organisational structure, a participatory management style, and promoting work <lb/>autonomy. A New Zealand Magnet Advisory Group was established in February 2002. Several DHBs are <lb/>now actively pursuing the possibility of introducing magnet concepts in New Zealand&apos;s health and <lb/>disability sector. Hutt Valley DHB has been the first to receive magnet hospital accreditation in June 2007 <lb/>(Nursing New Zealand, 2007). <lb/>20 <lb/>Until recently, doctors visiting New Zealand for up to three years were recorded in a temporary registration <lb/>category. This applied mainly to doctors trained in one of the following countries: United Kingdom, <lb/>Republic of Ireland, Canada, United States, and South Africa. This scope of practice no longer exists under <lb/>the current legislation and these doctors are now registered in either a provisional general or special-<lb/>purpose scope depending on their circumstances <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 <lb/></note>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>86. <lb/>Other types of retention strategies are also being developed at the DHB level. For instance, in the <lb/>Capital and Coast DHB, combined approaches have been developed to improve nurse turnover which was <lb/>around 33%. Following a large wage increase (about 20%), new training approaches, and better work-<lb/>related advantages, turnover rates are significantly lower, around 17%. Other approaches are based on <lb/>engaging staff and include granting awards for long term staff. <lb/>87. <lb/>Finally, &quot; recruiting back &quot; health professionals to the health workforce is a policy raising growing <lb/>interest as there is a pool of health workers, especially nurses who are either inactive or work in another <lb/>sector. But, to date this interest has not been translated into a specific policy. For instance, 14% of the <lb/>Registered Nurses and Midwives who purchased an Annual Practicing Certificate in 2000 were either in <lb/>non-nursing or midwifery job, or not in paid employment. This percentage was even higher for enrolled <lb/>nurses (21%) (New Zealand Health Information Service, New Zealand Nurses and Midwives 2000, <lb/>NZHIR, 2002). A study on this particular group found that 76% of registered nurses and midwives, and <lb/>79% of enrolled nurses, would consider returning to the clinical workforce (New Zealand Health <lb/>Information Service, Non-practicing nurses and midwives 2000, NZHIS, 2000). The survey also found that <lb/>the main factors that would attract nurses back to the clinical workforce were more flexible hours of work, <lb/>availability of return-to-work programmes, salary increases, and provision of child-care facilities. For <lb/>enrolled nurses, an improved image of nursing was also a major factor. <lb/>Retention in, and return to, New Zealand <lb/>88. <lb/> &quot; Recruiting back &quot; health worker who emigrated is also attracting more attention. In theory, there <lb/>is big pool of potential &quot; returnees &quot; for New Zealand to attract. Efforts are underway to better understand <lb/>why people leave through exit surveys, and strategies to attract back health workers who went overseas are <lb/>being developed. Alumni programs exist at the Wellington and Auckland public hospitals in order to <lb/>maintain contact between the hospital and former nurses. <lb/>89. <lb/>At the same time, there is an acknowledgement that many leave, at least temporarily, especially <lb/>to Australia, and, to a certain extent, a general acceptance that young individuals will leave New Zealand <lb/>for an overseas experience. In health occupations, a nursing career is even sometimes promoted as <lb/>allowing travels around the world. Higher wages, especially for junior doctors who have to reimburse their <lb/>student loan, professional opportunities and the quest for a new lifestyle are among the main factors <lb/>motivating health professionals to migrate from New Zealand. <lb/>90. <lb/>Retention of junior doctors is a serious concern in New Zealand. As depicted in Chart 16, by the <lb/>third year after graduation, approximately 30% of doctors from a graduate year will be lost. This retention <lb/>rate has showed little change over the past decade. 21 It can also be noted that about 10% of graduate <lb/>students do not register immediately after graduation; this figure reached almost 20% in 2004. As for <lb/>foreign-trained doctors, data on retention show a marked decrease in the first year after registration. In the <lb/>year after initial registration, less than 50% of international medical graduates remain in New Zealand <lb/>(Medical Council, 2006). This percentage is 33% in the third year after registration. This illustrates the <lb/>short-term pattern of the migration of health professionals to New Zealand, casting doubts on the role that <lb/>migration might play to address long-term supply needs. Reasons for low retention rates could be due inter <lb/>alia to a strong preference for short-term stays, remigration to other OECD countries or difficulties in <lb/>getting qualifications fully recognized. Further analysis should be carried out to disentangle these different <lb/>factors and identify appropriate policy responses. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">21 <lb/>The first-year retention of 101% for the 2004 graduates is rather high and may be due to either doctors who <lb/>completed their internship overseas or took a year off before registering in the following year. <lb/></note>

The TTMRA established that a person <lb/>registered to practice an occupation in New Zealand is entitled to practise an equivalent occupation in <lb/>Australia (and inversely) without the need to undergo further testing or examination. Movement between <lb/>New Zealand and Australia is also facilitated by the existence of transnational Medical Colleges that set up <lb/>similar requirements for post-graduate medical training in both Australia and New Zealand. <lb/></body>

			<body>94. <lb/>Australia is the major destination country for New Zealand health professionals, but the converse <lb/>is not true. While in the 2001 census the number of New Zealand-born doctors and nurses in Australia is <lb/>estimated at 1 086 and 5 443, respectively, Australian-born doctors and nurses in New Zealand amounted <lb/>only to 180 and 582, respectively. In 2001, 59% of New Zealand-born medical doctors living overseas <lb/>were in Australia (51% for dentists, 72% for pharmacists and 72% for nurses), whereas only 9.3% of <lb/>Australian-born doctors living overseas were in New Zealand (4% for dentists, 12.5% for pharmacists and <lb/>13.5% for nurses). Nonetheless, in relative terms, the proportion of Australian-born health professionals in <lb/>New Zealand among health professionals and New Zealand-born health professionals in Australia are very <lb/>similar, at approximately 2%. <lb/>95. <lb/>In terms of outflows of New Zealand doctors, the average annual number of arrivals (settlers, and <lb/>permanent and long-terms stays) in Australia is estimated around 330 per year for the period 1998-2006 <lb/>(see Chart 18). The corresponding average for nurses is just over 800. These out-migration flows are of <lb/>large magnitude for a country like New Zealand, compared to the annual number of new nursing and <lb/>medical graduates. <lb/>Chart 18.

In 2001, it was <lb/>required for New Zealanders to obtain permanent residence if they wished to gain access to social security, <lb/>to have citizenship or to sponsor other people for permanent residence. Otherwise, New Zealanders must <lb/>wait two years before being eligible for social benefits. 23 While these restrictions applied to New <lb/>Zealanders in Australia, the converse did not apply. At the end of the 90&apos;s, New Zealanders were also <lb/>affected by a measure aimed at discouraging the immigration of doctors. It was decided that all doctors <lb/>entering Australia (including those trained in New Zealand) would not be allowed to bill on the Medicare <lb/>system (Medicare is Australia&apos;s public universal health system) until ten years after they had gained <lb/>accreditation. However, this period of ten years is reduced to five years for doctors working in rural and <lb/>remote areas (defined at State level), and does not apply for those working in District Workforce Shortage <lb/>areas (defined at Federal level). The immediate impact of these measures can be seen on Chart 18 which <lb/>shows a decrease in long-term and permanent arrivals of doctors from New Zealand to Australia after <lb/>2001. <lb/>23 <lb/>Poot and Sanderson (2007) show that these policy changes affected the duration of stay and the likelihood <lb/>of return migration from Australia to New Zealand. <lb/></body>

			<body>97. <lb/>Emigration of young new Zealanders is a matter of concern although having international <lb/>experience is strongly encouraged as a way of capitalising knowledge and skills. The key question is: how <lb/>many come back and when? Unfortunately, evidence to answer these questions is scarce, especially in <lb/>terms of specific occupations. The new Zealand Government has recently developed a program to foster <lb/>return migration in general (tax reduction or immunities for those who have been abroad for more than 15 <lb/>years, facilitated procedure for the immigration of the partner, etc.), but these measures need to be further <lb/>evaluated. <lb/>2.4 Retirement <lb/>98. <lb/>In a context of health workforce ageing, retirement is an important factor to monitor. The ageing <lb/>of the health workforce is a major change observed in most OECD countries. However, specific <lb/>information about the retirement rate of health workers is rather scarce. The statutory pensionable age <lb/>often differs from the actual age of retirement. Evidence suggests that some independent health workers <lb/>continue working after they have reached pensionable age. At the same time, workers in many countries <lb/>are choosing to retire earlier. This trend seems to be taking hold among health workers as well and is likely <lb/>to be reinforced by the increasing presence of women, who retire earlier than their male counterparts. <lb/>99. <lb/>In New Zealand, older workers are an increasing share of the health workforce (Ministry of <lb/>Health, 2006a). While in 1990, 35% of the medical workforce was under 35 years of age, this figure had <lb/>fallen to 22% in 2004 (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2005). As the proportion of older doctors <lb/>and nurses is increasing, substantial retirement outflows can therefore be expected within the next decades. <lb/>The RNZCGP 2005 Membership survey indicates that retirement is the single most mentioned factor likely <lb/>to influence future work intentions (RNZCGP, 2005 RNZCGP Membership Survey: workforce series 2, <lb/>2006). For nurses, it is estimated that about 365 nurses or 1.1% retire each year (Department of Labour, <lb/>2005a). <lb/></body>

			<body>3. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES <lb/>100. <lb/>The New Zealand health system will face serious challenges in the future. Future demand for <lb/>healthcare services is expected to increase while future supply is thought to be insufficient. As a result, <lb/>health worker shortages are predicted if nothing is undertaken. <lb/>101. <lb/>Population ageing and its future impact on the demand for health workforce is perceived as a <lb/>major issue in New Zealand. It is projected that while total population will increase by 16% between 2001 <lb/>and 2021, the corresponding figure will be 72% for people aged 65 and over (NZIER 2004). The <lb/>percentage increase for Māori and Pacific Islander people is expected to be even greater. <lb/>102. <lb/>As a result of population ageing, long-term care costs are also expected to rise. Projections of <lb/>public health spending for long-term care for the period 2005 and 2050 suggest that the increase in public <lb/>spending on long-term care, in percentage points of GDP, will vary between 1.2 and 2% for New Zealand, <lb/>which is very similar to the OECD average ranging between 1.3 and 2.2% (Bjornerud et al., 2006). <lb/>103. <lb/>On the supply side, various trends need to be taken into consideration. In particular, a move <lb/>towards a better balance between work and leisure for health professionals, the introduction of new time <lb/>directives limiting working hours of health professionals, in particular for junior doctors, and the <lb/>feminisation of the medical workforce. <lb/>104. <lb/>Relying on three different scenarios, an assessment of future demand and supply of health <lb/>services was undertaken by the NZIER (NZIER 2004). Each scenario was based on different assumptions <lb/>about population growth, morbidity rates and the onset of disease and disability in old age. According to <lb/>the selected scenari, the demand for health services could increase by 40 to 69% between 2001 and 2021. <lb/>Assuming that demand for labour will grow in line with the health service demands, the study finds that the <lb/>demand for health professionals will outstrip supply by 2011. Depending on the scenario, the excess labour <lb/>demand over supply is expected to be equivalent to between 19 0007 and 28 000 health professionals, or <lb/>28% and 42% of the 2001 health workforce (NZIER, 2004). <lb/>105. <lb/>Of course, these are only scenarios for the future not exact predictions. Moreover, it is not <lb/>uncommon that predicted shortages or surpluses never materialize. Nonetheless, the results of this <lb/>projection demonstrate the importance of having a health workforce policy to address future challenges. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. CAN NEW ZEALAND COMPETE? <lb/>106. <lb/>So far, immigration contributes to a large extent to the supply of health workers in New Zealand. <lb/>However, increasing the number of overseas-trained health professionals might place New Zealand in a <lb/>delicate position as it could become too dependent on migration. In this context, one can wonder about the <lb/>sustainability of New Zealand policy in a context of increasing international competition to attract health <lb/>workers. <lb/>107. <lb/>In particular, ageing in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia is likely to have an <lb/>impact on labour demand for New Zealand and increase relative demand offshore for medical <lb/>professionals. This would make the New Zealand trained health professionals harder to retain, and the <lb/>potential pool of foreign recruits more difficult to attract. <lb/>108. <lb/>Given the relative small size of its health workforce and its heavy reliance on immigration, a <lb/>sudden change in the international migration flows, which could result from policy changes in OECD <lb/>countries beyond control of New Zealand authorities, could have a dramatic impact on New Zealand. <lb/>However, at the same time, taking into account the fact that the annual numbers of health professional <lb/>immigrants to New Zealand are relatively small compared the scale of worldwide flows, it is most likely <lb/>that New Zealand will be able to recruit the doctors and nurses it needs but at an increasing cost with <lb/>increasing difficulties to attract the best skills. This will make the education option more attractive but <lb/>taking into account the length of training it might require immediate action. <lb/>109. <lb/>Furthermore, in order to compete more effectively, New Zealand would need to improve the <lb/>critical issue of the retention of international health worker migrants, and in particular doctors. As <lb/>mentioned previously, turnover is very important, as only 33% of international medical graduates remain <lb/>in New Zealand after registration. A better management of health worker immigration necessitates <lb/>improving retention. In other words, the sustainability of New Zealand health workforce policy is probably <lb/>not so much jeopardized by the large reliance on immigration but rather by the failure to retain <lb/>international health worker migrants in New Zealand on the medium and long term. <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUDING REMARKS <lb/>110. <lb/>Despite the key role of the health workforce in the health system, it has not been at the core of <lb/>various health system reforms in New Zealand. Nonetheless, in recent years, health workforce issues have <lb/>captured more attention, and there is now a growing recognition of its importance. Moreover, in the <lb/>specific context of New Zealand, planning in health human resources is probably more of a challenge than <lb/>in most other OECD countries because of the key role of in-and out-migration which are only partially <lb/>determined by New Zealand policies. Increasing international competition for highly skilled workers raises <lb/>important issues such as sustainability and ability to compete in a global market. In this context, new <lb/>approaches to improve the international recruitment of health workers, as well as developing alternative <lb/>policies, may need to be considered. <lb/>111. <lb/>As for international recruitment, better coordination and stronger collaboration between the <lb/>Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Health and the DHBs could contribute to more effective and pertinent <lb/>international recruitment. For instance, the MoH and DHBs could certainly make valuable contributions to <lb/>the occupational shortage lists regarding the definition and discussion about health workforce shortages. <lb/>Also, a better coordination between DHBs in terms of international recruitment would be desirable. For <lb/>instance, a nationwide recruitment process could be considered. In addition, migration policy could also be <lb/>used to address some the concerns about the quality of the provision of aged care. As most people working <lb/>in aged care are unskilled, and an important share is coming from the Pacific Islands, developing bilateral <lb/>agreements with the Pacific Islands in order to set up migration programs with a training component could <lb/>be considered. <lb/>112. <lb/>The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stay of <lb/>health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While locum schemes are certainly a good policy <lb/>to address workforce shortages in rural areas, having a large number of migrants coming only for short-<lb/>term stays, raises issues of turnover and its associated costs in terms of recruitment and training costs. <lb/>Moreover, in order to address rural–urban imbalances, refining the points system in the context of the <lb/>migration policy could be considered. For instance, instead of awarding the same additional amount of <lb/>points for people settling outside Auckland as is the case now, one could introduce a points system with <lb/>greater regional variations, depending on the severity of health workforce shortages. <lb/>113. <lb/>Improving wages and working conditions in the health sector, developing further skill-mix <lb/>approaches, and attracting back health workers who have left New Zealand, are all complementary <lb/>approaches that need further consideration. <lb/>114. <lb/>While improving working conditions, skill mix and education are the object of a lot of attention <lb/>in many countries, attracting back health workers who have left their country has not captured much <lb/>attention so far. The complexity and the costs associated with such policies are likely to be a serious <lb/>deterrent. However, as the pool of New Zealand-born nurses and doctors living in other OECD countries is <lb/>so important—the number of New Zealand-born nurses living in other OECD countries is almost <lb/>equivalent to the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand—it is certainly worth considering specific <lb/>programs to attract back health workers, e.g. developing alumni networks, hospital twinning etc. Recent <lb/>measures adopted by New Zealand to facilitate the return of New Zealanders from abroad are encouraging. <lb/>In this context, focusing efforts on Australia and the United Kingdom would be natural as most New <lb/>Zealand emigrant health worker move to those two countries. Strengthening collaboration between <lb/></body>

			<page>46 <lb/></page>

			<body>Australia and New Zealand on health workforce policy issues could also be a way forward for both <lb/>countries. <lb/>115. <lb/>As for education, strengthening coordination between the main actors—DHBs, Tertiary <lb/>Education Commission and the Clinical Training Agency—would facilitate the development of a global <lb/>and common view, as emphasised in a recent report of the Health Workforce Taskforce (2007). DHBNZ <lb/>has a potential to play a greater role in this context. The possibility of increasing the annual intake of <lb/>medical students certainly deserves further investigation. Given the importance of immigration by doctors, <lb/>increasing the number of doctors trained domestically would seem a serious option, especially since the <lb/>number of graduates per 100 000 population in New Zealand is below the OECD average. Attracting more <lb/>foreign students is also a promising route, especially taking into account the flexibility of the New Zealand <lb/>migration system to accommodate status changes. This may imply, however, reconsidering the cost-<lb/>sharing of training costs for medical and nursing graduates. An issue which also applies to the case of New <lb/>Zealanders as we have seen that indebtedness remains one of the main incentives for out migration. <lb/></body>
