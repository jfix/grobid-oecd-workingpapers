Water is linked to many economic activities, <lb/>and there are complex channels through which water affects economic growth. The purpose of this report <lb/>is to provide background information useful for a quantitative global assessment of the impact of water <lb/>scarcity on growth using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) <lb/>model. The paper provides a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity <lb/>and economic growth, and identifies the possibilities and bottlenecks in incorporating water use into a <lb/>CGE framework. It covers agricultural water consumption, with special attention to irrigation, water use <lb/>in energy production, and demands for water by households, industry and services. Finally, it discusses <lb/>water supply and allocation. <lb/>Based on the evidence assembled, there appear to have been relatively few instances in which water <lb/>scarcity has significantly slowed the long term rate of national economic growth. Furthermore, in <lb/>reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across the board <lb/>are striking, including in the electric power sector, the production of industrial steam, residential <lb/>consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not <lb/>been more widespread to date is due to the absence of economic incentives for conservation. The <lb/>presence of large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the need for general equilibrium analysis. But <lb/>implementation of a global CGE model with detailed representation of water demand and supply will be a <lb/>significant undertaking. It is essential to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model, treat <lb/>water as both an input and an output, and add sectoral detail, with special attention to crop irrigation. <lb/>Furthermore, there are challenges in assigning appropriate values to water and specifying allocation rules <lb/>for dealing with water scarcity. <lb/>Keywords: water use, water scarcity, economic growth, CGE model. <lb/>JEL classification: C68, O44, Q15, Q25. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>4 <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>La demande mondiale d&apos;eau douce devrait augmenter de manière substantielles dans les prochaines <lb/>décennies, faisant de l&apos;eau l&apos;une des ressources les plus disputées de la planète. L&apos;eau est liée à toutes les <lb/>activités économiques et affecte la croissance par de multiples canaux. Le but de ce rapport est de donner <lb/>les éléments de fond qui sont utiles à la mise en place d&apos;une évaluation globale de l&apos;impact de la rareté en <lb/>eau sur la croissance économique dans un modèle d&apos;équilibre général calculable (EGC) multi-périodes et <lb/>multi-régions. Ce papier fournit une revue détaillée de la littérature sur l&apos;eau, la rareté en eau, l&apos;activité <lb/>sectorielle et la croissance économique; et identifie les possibilités et les goulots d&apos;étranglement en <lb/>incorporant l&apos;utilisation de l&apos;eau dans le cadre d&apos;un EGC. Il couvre la consommation d&apos;eau pour <lb/>l&apos;agriculture, avec une attention particulière pour l&apos;irrigation, ainsi que l&apos;utilisation de l&apos;eau pour la <lb/>production d&apos;énergie, et la demande d&apos;eau des ménages, de l&apos;industrie et des services. Enfin, il discute du <lb/>problème de la fourniture d&apos;eau et de son allocation. <lb/>Sur la base des éléments rassemblés, il semble qu&apos;il y ait eu relativement peu d&apos;exemples où la <lb/>rareté en eau ait ralenti significativement le taux de croissance économique de long terme. De plus, en <lb/>considérant la littérature sur la demande en eau, il est frappant de voir les grandes opportunités qui <lb/>existent pour économiser l&apos;eau, notamment dans les secteurs de la production d&apos;électricité, de vapeur pour <lb/>l&apos;industrie, dans la consommation résidentielle et l&apos;agriculture irriguée. Selon nous, la principale raison <lb/>pour laquelle une telle substitution ne s&apos;est pas diffusée jusqu&apos;à présent est liée à l&apos;absence d&apos;incitations <lb/>économiques à utiliser moins d&apos;eau. L&apos;existence de larges distorsions entre les secteurs rend hautement <lb/>nécessaire une analyse d&apos;équilibre général. Mais la mise en place d&apos;un modèle EGC mondial avec une <lb/>représentation détaillée de l&apos;offre et de la demande d&apos;eau sera une entreprise importante. Il est essentiel de <lb/>séparer l&apos;eau des autres inputs de l&apos;EGC, de traiter l&apos;eau à la fois comme un input et un output, et <lb/>d&apos;ajouter du détail sectoriel, avec une attention spécifique portée sur les cultures irriguées. De plus, il y a <lb/>des défis à relever pour donner à l&apos;eau une valeur dans le modèle et pour spécifier les règles d&apos;allocation <lb/>en cas de rareté. <lb/>Mots clés : demande d&apos;eau, rareté en eau, croissance économique, modèle EGC. <lb/>Classification JEL: C68, O44, Q15, Q25. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>5 <lb/>TABLE OF CONTENTS <lb/>ABSTRACT .................................................................................................................................................... 3 <lb/>RÉSUMÉ ........................................................................................................................................................ 4 <lb/>LIST OF ACRONYMS .................................................................................................................................. 7 <lb/>1.

MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW <lb/>1.1. Water in the Global Economy <lb/>The links between water scarcity and economic growth are complex and are only gradually <lb/>becoming apparent. There is relatively little literature that convincingly links water scarcity to economic <lb/>growth; the seminal work in this respect is Sadoff et al. (2015). They find a strong relationship between <lb/>water insecurity and growth, using a 113 country panel data analysis. The OECD Environmental Outlook <lb/>Baseline projects future demand for global freshwater (or more precisely &quot; blue water &quot; excluding rainfed <lb/>agriculture) to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050 and this is expected to make water one of the <lb/>most fiercely contested resources on the face of the planet (OECD, 2012). However, the projected pattern <lb/>of growth in demand for water is quite varied, with water use in the OECD countries declining over this <lb/>period, while growth in the BRIICS region is expected to nearly double (Figure 5.4, OECD, 2012). The <lb/>same report also identifies the complex channels through which water affects economic growth. Sorting <lb/>these out requires a more complete model of the global economy. The purpose of this report is to provide <lb/>background information useful for such a quantitative global assessment of the impact of water scarcity <lb/>on growth using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, such <lb/>as the OECD&apos;s ENV-Linkages model. Issues related to the quality of water are beyond the scope of this <lb/>report. <lb/>1.2. Implications for economic growth <lb/>Before embarking on a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity and <lb/>economic growth, it is useful to revisit several strands of economic theory to put this issue in context. <lb/>This report explores three different aggregate economic models, each of which treats water in a different <lb/>way. In so doing, it sheds light on several dimensions of water&apos;s impacts on economic growth which will <lb/>need to be taken into account as we move forward with the incorporation of water into a CGE framework. <lb/>1.2.1. Water as a publicly provided good, subject to congestion <lb/>A suitable starting point is the framework developed by Barbier (2004) who views water as a <lb/>publicly provided input into economic production. Individual firms&apos; draw on a common pool of water for <lb/>their activities so that their firm level output depends on the aggregate rate of water withdrawal. If <lb/>decision makers wish to make more water available to individual firms, the aggregate rate of withdrawal <lb/>must rise, relative to aggregate output. Furthermore, since this publicly provided input is subject to <lb/>congestion, as the rate of withdrawal rises, relative to aggregate output, the marginal productivity of that <lb/>water in any individual firms&apos; production declines. This is a clever way of dealing with the reuse problem <lb/>which will be discussed in more detail later in this report. Reuse presents a great challenge in regional and <lb/>national scale modelling, since water passing through one use is often reused downstream – after <lb/>appropriate treatment. On the supply side, the cost of providing additional water increases at an increasing <lb/>rate in Barbier&apos;s model, before eventually reaching some maximum rate of withdrawals determined by the <lb/>region&apos;s hydrological limits. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>9 <lb/>Figure 1. The optimal rate of water utilisation <lb/>Source: Reproduced from Barbier (2004) <lb/>When embedded within an optimal growth model, which accounts for the fact that resources devoted <lb/>to water extraction cannot be used to accumulate productive capital, an inverted-U shaped relationship <lb/>emerges between water withdrawals and economic growth (Figure 1). On the horizontal axis is the rate of <lb/>water utilisation, relative to total fresh water availability, and on the vertical axis is the economy&apos;s growth <lb/>rate. Within this framework, at any given point in time, there is an optimal rate of water withdrawal at <lb/>which the overall growth rate is maximised. Anything to the left of the optimal rate of withdrawal <lb/>suggests that the economy could benefit from greater public investment in water infrastructure since, at <lb/>the margin, the marginal cost of provision is lower than the marginal benefits conferred from greater <lb/>availability for firms or households in the economy. On the other hand, economies that find themselves to <lb/>the right of the optimum are devoting too many resources to water extraction. This could be either due to <lb/>very low water availability, or to an economy which is overly intensive in its use of water. <lb/>Having developed this model, Barbier proceeds to estimate its key parameters using cross-section <lb/>data for 163 countries in the 1990&apos;s. The model shows the expected properties (inverted U-shaped <lb/>relationship), and the parameter values imply a positive elasticity of growth with respect to withdrawals. <lb/>For example, a 10% increase in the rate of water utilisation could increase the average growth rate in the <lb/>sample of countries from 1.3 % per capita to 1.33 % per capita. He concludes: &quot; Our estimations of this <lb/>relationship also suggest that current rates of fresh water utilisation in the vast majority of countries are <lb/>not constraining economic growth. To the contrary, most countries may be able to increase growth by <lb/>utilising more of their fresh water resources, although there are obvious limits on how much additional <lb/>growth can be generated in this way. &quot; Barbier does find that sixteen of the countries in his sample (about <lb/>10 % of the observations) do face conditions of extreme water scarcity, and in these cases, further <lb/>statistical tests suggest that growth may be adversely affected by lack of water. This suggests that, during <lb/>the historical period examined, and when assessed at national scale, the problem of water scarcity <lb/>constraining economic growth was likely quite limited. <lb/>However, in practice, water supply and demand rarely respect national boundaries and so the <lb/>analysis of water scarcity and economic growth is not naturally amenable to country-level analysis. It may <lb/>be that the growth of subnational entities are more obviously constrained by water scarcity, but this fact <lb/>gets obscured when they are aggregated with unconstrained river basins. This is likely to be particularly <lb/>problematic for large countries and countries which draw on many river basins. Suffice it to say, at this <lb/>point, that, while Barbier finds little evidence of water scarcity constraining growth at the national level, <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>10 <lb/>this does not preclude water scarcity being more widespread at the sub-national level. Subnational <lb/>analyses are also important due to the imperfect substitutability of ground for surface water (OECD, <lb/>2015a). Some regions rely heavily on one or the other, and, as shown below this can have important <lb/>consequences for economic growth. <lb/>1.2.2. Aggregate Production Function Approach <lb/>Continuing in the spirit of Barbier&apos;s work, but now thinking about water as an input (W) into a <lb/>national production function, GDP (denoted as y) can be written as a function of water and a composite <lb/>input comprising both physical and human capital (K): <lb/>( , ) <lb/>y f K W <lb/> <lb/>. For simplicity let us assume that <lb/>this production function is of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) variety so that substitution <lb/>possibilities in this economy can be characterised by a constant elasticity of substitution,  . As society <lb/>accumulates additional capital, one expects the capital/water ratio: / <lb/>KW to rise, thereby inducing relative <lb/>scarcity of water – assuming that the overall supply of water is limited by the hydrological cycle. In such <lb/>an economy, the value of  is critical to the potential for long run growth in this economy. If firms and <lb/>households can take advantage of the increasingly abundant capital to invest in water-saving or reuse <lb/>technologies, and if these technologies are sufficiently effective, then growth will proceed apace. This is <lb/>indicative of an economy with a large value of  . Indeed, provided <lb/>1 <lb/>  , even in the absence of water-<lb/>saving technological change, the share of water in GDP will diminish over time as the economy becomes <lb/>more and more water-efficient through capital-water substitution. On the other hand, in an economy <lb/>where output per gallon of water cannot be increased via capital investment ( <lb/>0 <lb/>  ), growth will be <lb/>curtailed if water supplies cannot be increased through additional capital investment. Therefore, from an <lb/>empirical point of view, it is important to obtain accurate estimates of the sectoral elasticity of <lb/>substitution between other inputs and water. <lb/>In practice the economy comprises many sectors, each with many different end uses for water. Water <lb/>can also be processed and reused in many cases. Therefore, an economy-wide estimate of  needs to <lb/>reflect the possibility of such reuse. In addition, it must reflect not only the ability to become more <lb/>efficient in specific end uses, but also the possibility of eliminating some end uses altogether. The <lb/>economy-wide estimate of  must also incorporate the potential to substitute away from products <lb/>produced by particularly water-intensive technologies. These types of intra-and inter-sector substitution <lb/>relationships are difficult to capture in a single aggregate economic model. However, the goal of <lb/>multisector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models is to capture these effects. By including <lb/>within the model the potential for technical substitution and innovations at a disaggregated level, as well <lb/>as the potential to substitute away from water intensive intermediate and final goods, CGE models allow <lb/>for an accurate assessment of the economy-wide potential for substitution of capital and other inputs for <lb/>water. This is why CGE models will be a focal point of this survey of water scarcity and economic <lb/>growth. <lb/>1.2.3. Water and Growth in a CGE Framework <lb/>A natural way to think about economic growth within a CGE framework is to track the per capita <lb/>utility of a representative household in the economy. From a policy perspective, changes in utility are <lb/>typically translated into monetary terms (e.g. USD) using the concept of equivalent variation (EV), or the <lb/>change in real income associated with a reduction in water availability. EV is likely to be affected via a <lb/>number of different channels. This section explores these channels in some detail, as they will determine <lb/>the ultimate impact of water scarcity on economic growth and welfare. As this discussion requires some <lb/>technical background, the following sub-section develops these ideas in detail. The reader solely <lb/>interested in policy implications can skip over this sub-section and go immediately to the policy sub-<lb/>section. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/></body>

			<body>Technical Preliminaries: Equation (1) provides a stylised decomposition of regional economic <lb/>welfare in the context of a global CGE model (Huff and Hertel 2001). (Notation will be introduced as we <lb/>discuss this equation.) For the sake of compactness, this expression abstracts from the impact of emerging <lb/>new economic activities, increased scale of production, and endogenous productivity, as would be found <lb/>in many contemporary CGE applications. These are readily incorporated in an extended welfare <lb/>decomposition. However, water scarcity is unlikely to play a large role in any of these components of <lb/>economic growth. Equation (1) also abstracts from capital depreciation, taxes/subsidies on intermediate <lb/>inputs, and exogenous changes in efficiency. All of these considerations are typically also included in <lb/>global CGE analyses – in particular those based on the GTAP framework. However, they are not required <lb/>to make the key points under consideration <lb/>here. <lb/>Before proceeding, note that the EV <lb/>decomposition in equation (1) refers to the <lb/>change in welfare in region s – just one <lb/>region of the many in the global economy <lb/>where r denotes a trading partner region <lb/>which is the source of imports into our <lb/>focus region, s. s <lb/> is a scaling factor which <lb/>is normalised to one initially, but changes as <lb/>a function of the marginal cost of utility in <lb/>the presence of non-homothetic preferences <lb/>(McDougall 2003). The subscripts i refer to <lb/>produced commodities, of which there are <lb/>N in total. As shown below, in most CGE <lb/>models, this is where municipal water <lb/>shows up since the municipal water supply <lb/>is provided by a public utility using scarce <lb/>resources. Water can also appear as an <lb/>endowment, alongside capital, labour and <lb/>land, of which there are E endowments in <lb/>total, each potentially employed in any of <lb/>the J sectors. In this case, one thinks of the <lb/>sector in question extracting the water as part of its sectoral production function. Obviously this would be <lb/>the case for the municipal utility providing water as an intermediate input to other sectors. However, it <lb/>also applies to farms which pump groundwater for use in irrigating their crops, and industries which <lb/>supply their own water. In this case, the capital, labour and energy used in groundwater pumping <lb/>embedded in the production function for the irrigated sector. So water can show up in several places in <lb/>this welfare decomposition. Ultimately water availability traces back to physical endowments of water <lb/>and it is the scarcity of this water endowment which will be our focus here. <lb/>The first way in which water scarcity affects welfare in this economy is the most obvious, direct <lb/>channel – namely there is less water available for use! In the case of water endowments, this is captured <lb/>by the first term in brackets  <lb/> <lb/>( <lb/>/ <lb/>) <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>PE QE dQE QE <lb/>which reflects the current valuation of water&apos;s <lb/>contribution to the economy, based on the &apos;shadow price&apos; of water (i.e. Endowment i) in region s <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>is <lb/>PE , and its quantity  <lb/> <lb/>is <lb/>QE , thereupon multiplying this valuation of water by the proportional <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>1 <lb/>11 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>11 <lb/>11 <lb/>11 <lb/>( <lb/>/ <lb/>) <lb/>E <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>i <lb/>EJ <lb/>Eijs <lb/>ijs <lb/>ijs <lb/>ij <lb/>N <lb/>Ois <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>i <lb/>N <lb/>CDis <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>i <lb/>ss <lb/>N <lb/>CMis <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>i <lb/>NR <lb/>Mirs <lb/>irs <lb/>irs <lb/>ir <lb/>NR <lb/>irs <lb/>irs <lb/>ir <lb/>NR <lb/>irs <lb/>irs <lb/>ir <lb/>PE QE dQE QE <lb/>PFE dQFE <lb/>PD dQO <lb/>PD dQD <lb/>EV <lb/>PM dQM <lb/>PCIF dQMS <lb/>QMS dPFOB <lb/>QMS dPCIF <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>(1) <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>12 <lb/>change in its availability, ( <lb/>/ <lb/>) <lb/>is <lb/>is <lb/>dQE QE <lb/>1 <lb/>. So if the contribution of water to the regional economy is USD <lb/>1billion, and there is a 10% reduction in its availability, then a first-order guess at the welfare cost would <lb/>be 0.10*USD 1bill. = USD 100mill. This is just a first-order estimate, since any reduction in available <lb/>water will affect the marginal value product of water. It is also the kind of estimate which can be <lb/>generated without resource to an economy-wide model. Of course, such a shortage will also interact with <lb/>other features of the economy – hence the need for economic modelling in the context of the CIRCLE <lb/>project. The subsequent discussion draws out the most important types of interactions which the <lb/>economic model will need to capture. <lb/>In a market-based model (the problem presented by the absence of water markets will be discussed <lb/>shortly), the valuation of water is embedded in the market price, which is expected to rise with increasing <lb/>scarcity. Whether or not the proportionate rise in price exceeds the proportionate decline in water <lb/>availability can be related directly back to the economy-wide elasticity of substitution discussed above. If <lb/>1 <lb/>  , then price will rise less than quantity, and the value pre-multiplying the proportional change in <lb/>water availability to the economy will fall. On the other hand, if water is essential to household and firm <lb/>production processes ( 1 <lb/>  ), then price will rise faster than the quantity reduction and the valuation of <lb/>water in the economy will rise as water becomes more scarce. In this case, the penalty for the first 1% cut <lb/>in water will be less than that which applies when cumulative reductions have reached 10%. The <lb/>empirical literature on the price elasticity of demand for water discussed throughout this survey provides <lb/>support for the hypothesis that, in many cases, <lb/>1 <lb/>  is observed – at least at the level of individual firms <lb/>and households. <lb/>This direct impact of water scarcity on per capita regional welfare notwithstanding, there are quite a <lb/>number of other ways in which water scarcity can affect welfare in region s. The first is via reallocation of <lb/>water. As seen for example with the frequent droughts in California, water scarcity can result in <lb/>significant shifts in different sectors&apos; claims on the diminished water resources. 2 When the marginal value <lb/>product of water in different uses differs greatly within an economy, there is considerable potential for <lb/>&apos;second best&apos; efficiency effects from such reallocations. Consider the situation portrayed in Figure 2a in <lb/>which a pre-determined amount of water withdrawals, W , is allocated between sectors A and B, as <lb/>reflected by the initial allocations: A <lb/>W and B <lb/>W . This pattern of water allocation reflects the presence of an <lb/>implicit subsidy on water use in sector A – or equivalently – a tax on Endowment Water use in sector B <lb/>of region s: EWBs <lb/> <lb/>--since the marginal value product of water in A (read off the * <lb/>Aasegment) is lower <lb/>than that in B (read off the * <lb/>Bbsegment) at the initial equilibrium denoted by point e. Without the <lb/>tax/subsidy, the equilibrium allocation would be * <lb/>W . The loss in economic efficiency to this economy <lb/>from this distorted use of water is measured by the shaded area in Figure 2. <lb/>1 . <lb/>This expression offers a local approximation to EV, for large changes, the price and quantity levels must <lb/>also change. The ensuing numerical integration is what allows us to compute the sources of EV for large <lb/>shocks. <lb/>2 . <lb/>The substitutability between surface water and groundwater also matters when considering reallocation. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>13 <lb/>Figure 2. Welfare cost of an implicit subsidy on water used in Agriculture (A) <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; own elaboration <lb/>Several CGE studies have sought to quantify this loss in efficiency. For example, in a recent study of <lb/>water and economic growth in South Africa, Hassan and Thurlow (2011) estimate that the benefits of <lb/>reallocation of water within the agricultural sector and across water board regions within the country <lb/>would amount to a recurring economic gain equal to 4.5% of agricultural GDP. This effect is captured in <lb/>Equation (1) by the term:  <lb/> <lb/>Eijs <lb/>ijs <lb/>ijs <lb/>PFE dQFE <lb/> <lb/>, wherein the implicit subsidy of endowment i to a specific <lb/>crop (j) in region s is captured by the term  <lb/> 0 <lb/>Eijs <lb/>ijs <lb/>PFE <lb/> <lb/> due to the presence of a subsidy (negative <lb/>tax), so that when the amount of water allocated to this use falls, <lb/>ijs <lb/>dQFE &lt;0, there is a welfare gain, as <lb/>anticipated by Figure 2. The same concept applies to the other terms in Equation (1), which refer to output <lb/>subsidies/taxes, as well as consumption subsidies/taxes. (Intermediate inputs have been excluded from <lb/>Equation (1) for the sake of simplicity, but can also play a key role.) In short, the larger the initial <lb/>distortion  <lb/> <lb/>Eijs <lb/>ijs <lb/>PFE <lb/> <lb/>, and the larger the reallocation of water  <lb/> <lb/>ijs <lb/>dQFE , the greater the potential gain <lb/>from a reallocation. In her review of the empirical literature on water use and allocation, Olmstead (2013) <lb/>cites intersectoral price differentials between agriculture and urban uses in the United States wherein the <lb/>latter can be paying as much as 100 times as much as the former sector pays for water. This suggests that <lb/>such reallocation effects could be very large indeed. <lb/>To the extent that increasing water scarcity induces such reallocations of water amongst competing <lb/>uses, then some of this area can be recouped as an efficiency gain, thereby offsetting some of the loss <lb/>associated with the water reduction. Another way of thinking about this is to consider a situation in which <lb/>all of the water shortage is absorbed by sector A. Since the MVP of water in A is less than the average <lb/>valuation of water in the economy, part of the loss calculated in the first term of Equation (1) will be <lb/>made up through the reallocation effect captured in the second term of (1). This outcome is consistent <lb/>with the view of some water analysts that irrigated agriculture is the residual claimant on regional water <lb/>resources, and it is this sector which will suffer most of the reductions if and when water use is curtailed. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>14 <lb/>Figure 3. Welfare implications of a rise in world food prices facing an agricultural exporter <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; own elaboration <lb/>Even if there is not an explicit decision to reallocate water between the two sectors, the presence of <lb/>this factor market distortion can give rise to unanticipated efficiency changes, provided the allocation of <lb/>water between the two sectors is subject to adjustment at the margin, as would be the case if this is <lb/>achieved via a subsidy, a tax, or a quota which is periodically re-evaluated. Consider, for example, the <lb/>case in which there is an improvement in nonfarm technology over time, such that the marginal value <lb/>product of water schedule associated with production in sector B rises from * <lb/>Bb to * <lb/>Bb  . Then region s <lb/>will firstly benefit from improved technology (the shaded technology gain area in Figure 3), and it will <lb/>also gain from the induced reallocation of water from sector A to sector B (efficiency gain area in <lb/>Figure 3). This kind of interplay between economic growth and water scarcity on the one hand, and pre-<lb/>existing distortions on the other hand, is evidenced in the next three terms in Equation (1). The presence <lb/>of output subsidies or taxes, consumption taxes on domestic and imported goods, as well as tariffs on <lb/>imports, will likely interact with the quantity changes induced by water scarcity and sometimes give rise <lb/>to significant welfare effects at the regional level (Liu et al. 2014). <lb/>Of course, when the inter-sectoral allocation of water is controlled by quotas, and these quotas are <lb/>not adjusted over time, then the efficiency change component of Figure 3 will not materialise. However, <lb/>if the pressure caused by the economic growth in sector B eventually results in a reallocation of quotas, <lb/>then this principle is applicable. There is an additional efficiency gain, relative to baseline welfare in the <lb/>economy and it is larger, the greater the initial distortion in the water market EWBs <lb/> <lb/>, and the larger the <lb/>reallocation of water from sector A to sector B ( dW ). <lb/>The final two terms in equation (1) refer to the terms of trade effects alluded to above. In practice, <lb/>most countries engage in two-way trade, such that they are both exporters and importers of most product <lb/>categories. This makes the terms of trade calculations more complex. It is no longer sufficient to simply <lb/>focus on a region&apos;s net exports. The effect of bilateral changes in export prices ( <lb/>irs <lb/>PFOB ) and import <lb/>prices ( <lb/>irs <lb/>PCIF ) for all goods traded with all partner regions must now be considered. Indeed, in an <lb/>investigation of the trade impacts of projected water scarcity, Liu et al. (2014) find that trading countries <lb/>are differentially affected depending on how intensively they trade with the economies affected by water <lb/>scarcity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Policy Implications: From the point of view of policy analysis, the key point of the preceding <lb/>technical discussion is that water scarcity and economic growth can interact in a variety of ways. Most <lb/>decision makers think first and foremost about the direct effect: The economy now has fewer resources to <lb/>work with, therefore growth is expected to slow down, with the extent of this lost welfare depending on <lb/>the marginal economic value of water to the economy and the size of the shortfall. However, there are <lb/>many other potential avenues through which water scarcity can affect the economy. By raising the cost of <lb/>production for water intensive goods and services, water scarcity sends a signal to reduce the output of <lb/>these sectors. If this releases water to higher value uses, such that most of the adjustment in use occurs in <lb/>low value (subsidised) sectors, then the losses may not be as great as initially thought. The size of such <lb/>offsetting gains increases with the size of the initial disparity in effective prices paid for water and the <lb/>quantity of reallocation which occurs. In her review of the empirical literature on water use and <lb/>allocation, Olmstead (2013) cites intersectoral price differentials between agriculture and urban uses in <lb/>the United States where the latter can be paying as much as 100 times as much as the former sector pays <lb/>for water. 3 This suggests that such reallocation benefits could be very large indeed – especially if the <lb/>water crisis led this distortion to be reduced. <lb/>In a global economy, water scarcity also affects the price of traded goods and services. For countries <lb/>which rely heavily on water-intensive imports, future water scarcity can result in terms of trade losses – or <lb/>gains in the case of net exporters of these products. If, in addition, these activities are themselves <lb/>recipients of other sorts of taxes and subsidies, there is potential for additional &apos;second best&apos; effects. For <lb/>example, in their analysis of the impact of future water scarcity on global trade and economic welfare, Liu <lb/>et al. (2014) find that global welfare losses in their 2030 scenario are exacerbated by the increase, relative <lb/>to baseline, in subsidised agricultural production in the EU and the US – two regions which experience <lb/>relatively less long run scarcity in water in the aggregate according to the long run projections (Rosegrant <lb/>et al. 2013). <lb/>1.2.4. Virtual Water Trade <lb/>With water scarcity increasingly influencing commodity trade patterns, a new body of literature has <lb/>arisen around the concept of &apos;virtual water trade&apos;. The idea is that nearly all commodities require water in <lb/>their production process – irrigated agriculture being one of the most striking examples. When water is <lb/>physically consumed in one region to produce commodities which are themselves exported and consumed <lb/>in another region, this implicit transfer of water resources is dubbed &apos;virtual water&apos;. 4 The volume of <lb/>virtual water trade has grown, along with growth in global trade, and it is estimated to have risen from <lb/>259 cubic km in 1986 to 567 cubic km in 2007 (Dalin et al., 2012). The concept of virtual water trade is <lb/>fully consistent with global CGE modelling. Water-augmented global CGE models allow for both the <lb/>calculation of water embodied in production at a given location, as well as the tracking of bilateral flows <lb/>from the region of production to the region of consumption. Therefore, they offer an ideal vehicle for <lb/>predicting how virtual water flows are likely to evolve in the future, including under scenarios of <lb/>economic reform or climate change (Konar et al., 2013). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 . <lb/>More generally, despite encouraging trends, few OECD countries practice full cost recovery for <lb/>agriculture use through charges, even if this definition is limited to full supply costs (OECD, 2010). <lb/>4 . <lb/>The concept is however subject to multiple shortcomings and found to be unsuitable for policy purposes <lb/>(e.g., Wichelns, 2010). <lb/></note>

			<body>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>16 <lb/>1.2.5. Implications for the Modelling of Water Scarcity and Growth <lb/>This brief overview of some of the basic principles behind water scarcity and economic growth <lb/>provides some important guidelines as it reviews the literature pertaining to specific sectors of the <lb/>economy. The first point is that the costs of increasing water withdrawals must be factored in, and this <lb/>cost function should be convex, such that costs rise at an increasing rate. There is empirical support for <lb/>this characterisation of costs; if they are not present in the model, one risks greatly overstating the benefits <lb/>from increasing withdrawals. A second point relates to the importance of understanding the extent to <lb/>which capital, and other inputs, can be substituted for water in response to scarcity. This could come in <lb/>the form of more efficient equipment, improved recycling of water, or enhanced extraction. <lb/>Underestimating this potential for capital-water substitution could lead to overstating the costs of water <lb/>scarcity to the economy. In addition to this type of factor substitution, it is also possible to conserve <lb/>scarce water through the modification of the mix of products produced and consumed in an economy. <lb/>Capturing this effect requires understanding how water scarcity feeds through to higher prices for water-<lb/>intensive goods and services, and ultimately alters household consumption patterns. Finally, as water <lb/>scarcity will affect different parts of the economy, and these different parts are all linked, a multi-sectoral <lb/>economy-wide analysis using e.g. CGE models, is the suitable tool for investigating how the costs of <lb/>water scarcity are influenced by feedbacks from scarcity to economic growth. <lb/>The welfare decomposition discussed above underscores the critical importance of accurately <lb/>estimating the marginal value product of water in different uses and understanding the mechanism by <lb/>which water shortfalls are allocated across uses. While quotas are a common vehicle for allocating water <lb/>to different uses, these are themselves likely to change in response to long run market conditions and <lb/>these changes must be part of any long run analysis as they will have important implications for economic <lb/>efficiency and hence economic growth. <lb/>Finally, it must be borne in mind that CGE models in general, and global CGE models in particular, <lb/>are only one of many approaches to analysing the impacts of water scarcity. Indeed, as shown in the <lb/>ensuing literature review, the accurate specification of global CGE models relies heavily on more <lb/>disaggregated studies of water supply and demand. Most of these studies are partial equilibrium in nature, <lb/>assuming economic growth is exogenously specified and instead delving into the complexities of water <lb/>supply and demand in a given watershed or river basin. Such studies are essential inputs into the type of <lb/>global CGE analysis proposed in the ensuing report. <lb/>2. AGRICULTURE: THE LARGEST CONSUMER OF WATER <lb/>How much water is used to produce food each year? Crop evapotranspiration alone (not including <lb/>water for food processing and preparation) consumes about one litre of water to produce one calorie <lb/>(Molden 2007). Using this metric, one can calculate that the total amount of water vaporised in a year to <lb/>feed today&apos;s 7.1 billion people amounts to 7.7 cubic kilometres. One fifth of this water total comes from <lb/>the application of irrigation water which, in turn, accounts for 70 % of total annual global freshwater <lb/>withdrawals (Molden 2007). Even though agriculture withdrawals have decreased in some regions over <lb/>the past decade, they still represented 44% of total freshwater withdrawals of OECD countries (OECD, <lb/>2013). Although it faces increasingly stiff competition for water from other uses in many parts of the <lb/>world, agriculture is therefore the largest consumer of water in the global economy and will remain so in <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>17 <lb/>the foreseeable future (Faures et al. 2007). This suggests that water use for irrigation deserves special <lb/>attention in any analysis of the implications of future water scarcity for the global economy. <lb/>2.1. Extent of irrigation <lb/>2.1.1. Global irrigated area <lb/>According to the most recent assessment by the FAO, 16% of the world&apos;s cultivated cropland is <lb/>equipped for irrigation (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012). Since the use of irrigation is subject to <lb/>multiple factors including investment, climate condition and water endowment, the extent of irrigation <lb/>varies considerably across regions (Figure 4). About 70% of the area equipped for irrigation is located in <lb/>15 Asian countries, 16% in America, 8% in Europe, 5% in Africa and 1% in Oceania (Siebert et al. 2010). <lb/>The dependency on irrigation can either enhance or impair a country&apos;s agricultural comparative <lb/>advantage, depending on the costs of irrigation and how well irrigation needs can be satisfied. On the <lb/>beneficial side, reliable and sufficient irrigation boosts yields and reduces agriculture&apos;s vulnerability to <lb/>climate variability. Nonetheless, agriculture that is highly dependent on irrigation may become more <lb/>fragile under the circumstance of irrigation shortfall. Liu et al. (2014) find that intensively irrigated <lb/>regions like India, China and Middle East/North Africa may experience increased food imports in the <lb/>coming decades as water is diverted from agricultural to non-agricultural uses due to rising income <lb/>growth and urbanisation. <lb/>Figure 4. Percent of cropland that is irrigated, by grid cell area, globally. Total irrigated area is 285 Mha <lb/>Source: Siebert et al. (2010) <lb/>Between the present and 2050, it is expected that net global irrigated area will continue to expand, <lb/>but more slowly compared with the historical growth, as a result of overall adequacy of current food <lb/>supply, increasing scarcity of suitable areas for irrigation, more intense competition for water and rising <lb/>importance of investment in other sectors (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012). The estimated 20 million <lb/>ha net expansion by mid-century is expected to occur almost exclusively in land-scarce developing <lb/>countries (Figure 5) where increases in agricultural output will depend heavily on yield increases <lb/>(Bruinsma 2009). Unfortunately, the cropping areas most in need of irrigation are often located in regions <lb/>where water resources are naturally scarce and facing increasingly stiff competition from other uses. This <lb/>points to rising opportunity costs of water devoted to irrigation and greater pressure to conserve irrigation <lb/>water. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 5. Area equipped for irrigation: historical and projected (Mha). <lb/>Source: Bruinsma (2009) <lb/>In the preceding discussion, and in much of the global agriculture literature, the extent of irrigation is <lb/>characterised by the area equipped for irrigation. A more relevant indicator tracks the area where <lb/>irrigation is actually in use. The FAO estimated this fraction to average about 85% (ranging from <lb/>40-100%, depending on the region) of the global 302 million ha equipped area, during the period 2005/07 <lb/>(Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The distinction between the two immediately leads to the problem of <lb/>how to model expansion of irrigation. One suggestion would be to differentiate harvested and physical <lb/>irrigated area. Expansion reflected by newly irrigated area is typically lower than expansion measured by <lb/>the growth of areas actually irrigated (10% vs. 12% from 2005/07 to 2050, according to Alexandratos and <lb/>Bruinsma, 2012), due to the continuing increase in multiple cropping under irrigated conditions. <lb/>Additionally, the expansion estimated by the FAO is expressed in net terms, thus not taking into account <lb/>the rehabilitation of existing irrigated areas. Including or excluding this portion of the expansion makes a <lb/>substantial difference in estimating the investment required to sustain irrigated agriculture. <lb/>2.1.2. Water supply for irrigation: <lb/>Increasing water supply for irrigation is subject to infrastructure constraints (storage and withdrawal <lb/>facilities) and water source limits (Rosegrant and Cai 2002). The latter is determined by both hydrological <lb/>flows and the residential, industrial and environmental demands for water. Indeed, agriculture is often the <lb/>residual claimant of water within a given basin although water allocation regimes vary greatly across <lb/>countries (e.g., OECD, 2015b). Keeping infrastructure capacity and water use efficiency unchanged, the <lb/>water budget for irrigation is likely to dwindle as the economy and populations grow. Strzepek and <lb/>Boehlert (2010) predict an 18% reduction in worldwide water available for agriculture by 2050, mainly <lb/>caused by increasing environmental flow requirements and larger municipal and industrial demands. <lb/>OECD (2012) also foresees a lower water demand for irrigation due to increasing competition from other <lb/>sectors. In hotspots like northern Africa, India, China, parts of Europe, the western United States and <lb/>eastern Australia, the reduction in water for irrigation could be dramatic. <lb/>Forty-two percent of world irrigation water withdrawals come from groundwater, and the rest from <lb/>surface water (Döll et al. 2012). The two sources of water, however, are rarely distinguished in economic <lb/>models, yet their fundamental characteristics are quite different as are the growth rates and potential <lb/>hydrological constraints (OECD, 2015a). Groundwater is generally less vulnerable to climate variability <lb/>than surface water. The two sources of water also compete with different uses. Groundwater, contributes a <lb/>smaller fraction to public uses: on average, globally, 36% and 27% for households and manufacturing <lb/>versus 42% for irrigation (Döll et al. 2012). Therefore, it may face less intense competition from non-<lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>19 <lb/>agricultural uses. 5 Finally, the two sources of irrigation have different environmental impacts, as will be <lb/>discussed below. <lb/>Ground water irrigation <lb/>Groundwater has a number of valuable characteristics. First of all, it is less sensitive to annual <lb/>climate events as it responds more slowly to meteorological conditions than does surface water. <lb/>Figure 6. Groundwater withdrawals in selected countries <lb/>Source: Burke and Villholth (2007) <lb/>Therefore, the expectation is that the importance of ground water with regard to irrigation supply <lb/>will intensify as more frequent and severe extreme weather events increase variability in precipitation, <lb/>soil moisture and surface water (Taylor et al. 2012). During the 2013-15 drought in California, for <lb/>example, farmers largely turned to groundwater for irrigation, fulfilling up to 70% of lost rain water <lb/>supplies and contributing to strong agricultural revenues (Gruere, 2015; Medellin-Azuara et al., 2015). <lb/>However, the slow recovery of groundwater to a dynamic equilibrium state means withdrawal can easily <lb/>surpass replenishment and lead to groundwater depletion. Over-drafting, especially in the regions that are <lb/>becoming heavily dependent on groundwater, weakens its buffering effect, potentially making agriculture <lb/>even more fragile to longer drought duration. Groundwater intensive use also can lead to major <lb/>environmental externalities, from saline intrusion to land subsidence (OECD, 2015a). Pavelic et al. (2012) <lb/>show that the average residence time of shallow, accessible groundwater ranges from less than one year to <lb/>four years, which explains why two or more years of continuous drought could pose a serious problem to <lb/>farmers relying on groundwater for irrigation. <lb/>5 . <lb/>While agriculture groundwater use is very high in some regions, the overall average share is under 10%, <lb/>and often minimal in most OECD countries (OECD, 2015b). <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>20 <lb/>Although groundwater availability is much less sensitive to climatic conditions compared with <lb/>surface water, the rate of groundwater recharge could be modified by the altered precipitation pattern <lb/>under the same aquifer conditions. Regions with high transmissivity and storage volume generally have a <lb/>higher reliance on groundwater irrigation, especially when climate conditions are favourable to <lb/>groundwater recharge (Siebert et al. 2010). In low recharge areas, leakages from inefficient irrigation <lb/>systems actually play a significant role in recharge (OECD, 2015b). In some cases, the linkage between <lb/>groundwater recharge and geophysical conditions could be complicated by land use change. For example, <lb/>in the West African semiarid belt, clearing savannah for cropland modified soil properties and infiltration <lb/>capacities, which substantially increased groundwater recharge (Leblanc et al. 2008). <lb/>Another advantage of groundwater has to do with accessibility by farmers, and their ability to use it <lb/> &quot; on demand &quot; (OECD, 2015a). While surface water rights are often predetermined and access involves <lb/>engagement with other institutions, groundwater can in many cases be accessed by simply drilling a well <lb/>– something under direct control of the farmer. Both of these factors have contributed to rapid growth in <lb/>groundwater withdrawals in many regions. Figure 6, taken from Burke and Villholth (2007) shows the <lb/>recent evolution of ground water use in various regions around the world. The growth in India since the <lb/>inception of the Green Revolution is staggering. Bangladesh, China, Mexico and Tunisia also show very <lb/>strong growth. Furthermore, some of the strongest growth has been in regions with low recharge rates as <lb/>shown in Figure 7 (Burke and Villholth 2007). <lb/>Figure 7. Long term average groundwater recharge rates (mm/year) <lb/>Source: Burke and Villholth (2007) based on Döll and Flörke (2005) <lb/>Surface water supplies <lb/>Global water withdrawal from surface sources has been slowing down recently, from a growth rate <lb/>of 2% in the 1980s to -1% during 1990-2010 (Wada et al. 2013), largely due to the fact that surface water <lb/>has already been heavily exploited and that the construction of new reservoirs has been declining since <lb/>the 1980s (Chao, Wu, and Li 2008; M. W. Rosegrant, Cai, and Cline 2002). Nevertheless, surface water <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>21 <lb/>remains the dominant source of irrigation in Europe (70%), Southeast Asia (more than 80%) and South <lb/>America (Wada et al. 2013). In OECD, surface water occupies two third of irrigated areas (OECD, <lb/>2015a). <lb/>Surface water supply is highly climate-dependent. Watershed responses to reduced precipitation <lb/>(including rain-and snowfall) and higher temperatures are typically amplified, due to vegetation <lb/>interception and transmission loss (Arnell 2004). Thus, for instance a 20% reduction in rainfall might <lb/>yield a 50% reduction in runoff (Turral, Svendsen, and Faures 2010). Although warming tends to increase <lb/>total precipitation and water discharge at the global level (Füssel et al. 2012; Milly, Dunne, and Vecchia <lb/>2005), this tendency may not translate directly into a more beneficial effect on surface water irrigation in <lb/>critical regions. This is due to the fact that climate models are predicting an uneven spatial and temporal <lb/>distribution of precipitation, in which the wet areas get wetter and the dry areas drier. Besides, even where <lb/>annual precipitation is not expected to decline, seasonal shifts may cause substantial problems if the <lb/>increased water runoff in rainy season cannot be impounded due to limited storage capacity. <lb/>The economic literature concerning stochastic surface water supply mainly focuses on its impact on <lb/>the flow of agricultural goods (e.g. crop output) and services (e.g. crop insurance), but there is much less <lb/>emphasis on the stock of capital (e.g. infrastructure). A theoretical analysis performed by Fisher and <lb/>Rubio (1997) shows that a larger variance of the surface water resource caused by climate uncertainty <lb/>provides an incentive to invest in water reserve infrastructure. In the long-run, the equilibrium level of the <lb/>capital stock (or water storage capacity) will likely increase in the face of a changing climate. <lb/>2.1.3. Water use in agriculture <lb/>It is common in the irrigation management literature to divide water applied to soil into two main <lb/> &quot; fractions &quot; , each with two &quot; sub-fractions &quot; . The consumed fraction contains beneficial transpiration and <lb/>non-beneficial evaporation; the non-consumed fraction can be further split into recoverable seepage and <lb/>non-recoverable seepage (Foster and Perry 2010). Distinguishing between these water categories is useful <lb/>when studying irrigation efficiency and water productivity, and their interaction with agriculture, <lb/>resources and environment. <lb/>Crop consumptive use <lb/>Consumptive use of water refers to any use that permanently removes water from the natural cycle, <lb/>such that this portion of water is no longer available for immediate reuse. Water is consumed by crops <lb/>when it is transpired, evaporated, or incorporated into products, plant tissue and animal tissue. <lb/>Consumptive water use includes both the beneficial transpiration by crops and the non-beneficial <lb/>evaporation from wet soil (including weed transpiration). Only the beneficial crop consumptive use <lb/>contributes directly to biomass generation. To use water in agriculture more efficiently, one can either <lb/>increase the capacity of crops to utilise water or increase the share of consumptive use relative to non-<lb/>consumptive use. <lb/>Agricultural water conservation is by no means equivalent to reducing water extraction for irrigation, <lb/>or making water resources available for non-agricultural uses. However, it does relate directly to increases <lb/>in the &quot; output per drop &quot; of consumptive water use in agriculture. In practice, output has been measured <lb/>both by quantity and value, which correspond, respectively, to the physical and economic productivity of <lb/>water. Regions like Sub-Saharan Africa still have great potential to boost yields, thereby increasing <lb/>physical water productivity; while in some Asian countries, where the yield gap is already small, there <lb/>appears to be wider scope to increase economic water productivity than to increase physical water <lb/>productivity (Molden et al., 2007). For these regions, the objective will likely shift to maximising the <lb/> &quot; value per drop &quot; , or the economic productivity of consumptive water. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>22 <lb/>Losses associated with water storage and delivery <lb/>This category of use of irrigation water use refers to the portion of water that is withdrawn but not <lb/>directly consumed by the crop. Therefore, this includes evaporation from water storage, which accounts <lb/>for a significant fraction in some regions. For example, reservoir evaporation in Texas amounts to about <lb/>61% of total agricultural irrigation use during the year 2010 (Wurbs and Ayala, 2014). In Australia, Craig <lb/>(2005) estimated this loss to be about 40% of the total storage volume. This evaporative loss could <lb/>increase by about 15% by 2080, due to the effect of higher surface temperatures in the face of climate <lb/>change (Helfer, Lemckert and Zhang, 2012). Increasing total usable water storage by reducing this type of <lb/>loss depends on the adoption of evaporation suppression technology, which is driven by the marginal <lb/>value product of the water to be saved. <lb/>Another form of non-consumptive use of water in cropland irrigation derives from the water stored <lb/>in soils. This can be further split into recoverable seepage that infiltrates freshwater aquifers as &quot; return <lb/>flows &quot; , as well as the non-recoverable seepage infiltrating a saline aquifer. Much of the water used to <lb/>flood rice fields or to support fish are also not consumed and is returned to the streamflow. <lb/>From the point view of farmers and irrigation engineers, the fraction of water use which does not <lb/>directly contribute to crop production is typically deemed a waste of water. However, when viewed from <lb/>the perspective of the overall watershed, the non-consumptive crop use is not always a loss (Molden <lb/>et al. 2010). Rather, in many cases, it appears to be a necessity, and even beneficial to soil and crops. One <lb/>example is the process called &quot; salt leaching &quot; . As water evaporates, salts contained in water concentrate in <lb/>the soil and must be displaced by the movement of water applied in excess of evapotranspiration. Thus, <lb/>some of the non-consumptive use is unavoidable and needed to maintain the salt balance in the soil <lb/>(Fereres and Soriano 2007). Infiltration from surface water irrigation in excess of crop requirements also <lb/>recharges underground water, and downstream water users can benefit from the return flows of upper <lb/>stream users (Molden et al. 2010). In Japan, irrigation-induced groundwater recharge from paddy rice <lb/>cultivation is very significant; multiple cities use it as a key to reduce aquifer depletion and mitigate the <lb/>risk of land subsidence (OECD, 2015a). Understanding these trade-offs is important for building <lb/>economic models, especially for properly formulating objective functions and constraints. Under certain <lb/>circumstances, the motivation is probably not to save water or to boost yields, but to obtain benefits like <lb/>environmental services, or perhaps simply to save on labour and energy. <lb/>2.2. Water in livestock production <lb/>Water for livestock production accounts for 20% of total water used by agriculture (de Fraiture <lb/>et al. 2007). This includes both the direct use like animal drinking, feed-mixing and service as well as the <lb/>indirect use for grazing and growing feed crops, but 98% of the water consumption is attributed to the <lb/>latter-evapotranspiration of blue and green water in the production of feedstuffs. Producing livestock is <lb/>generally believed to be much more water intensive than producing crops (Mekonnen and Hoekstra <lb/>2012). For example, the global average water footprint per ton of beef is about 50 times that of vegetables <lb/>and 10 times to that of cereals. However, water for livestock would be considered to be relatively less <lb/>costly compared to the nutritional value of livestock and crops. To continue the previous example, the <lb/>water footprint per gram of beef protein is 5 times of that for cereal protein, and water footprint per gram <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>23 <lb/>of beef fat is 3 times of that for nuts fat. 6 Nevertheless, meat-based diets do have a larger water footprint <lb/>than a vegetarian diet and therefore place additional burdens on limited water resources. <lb/>Demand for meat will continue to expand in the coming decades, largely driven by world population <lb/>growth and the nutrition transition taking place in many developing countries. It is likely that aggregate <lb/>water use in livestock will increase accordingly. There are several factors at work here. One is related to <lb/>the composition of meat demands due to differences in feed conversion ratios. Beef has a much lower <lb/>conversion rate (11 times more feed per kilogram meat) than chicken, thus leading to a larger total water <lb/>footprint. Nevertheless, only 5% of beef feed comes from concentrates (e.g. cereals), as compared with <lb/>the 73% of chicken feed (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2012). This means, in terms of blue water content, the <lb/>difference between raising beef and chicken is much smaller. As consumer preferences evolve, it is likely <lb/>that the share of chicken in meat consumption will rise, thereby having indirect impacts on the green and <lb/>blue water footprints. <lb/>Another important consideration is the degree of industrialisation in livestock sectors. The three <lb/>major production systems – grazing, industrial and mixed – have different water requirement profiles. <lb/>Extensive grazing systems are less efficient in feed conversion and therefore require more land resources <lb/>than the industrial systems, but grazing systems require a lower fraction of concentrate feeds, they place <lb/>less stress on blue water, and generate less water pollution than industrial systems for livestock <lb/>production. Over time, the livestock sector has been shifting away from the extensive grazing systems and <lb/>towards industrial systems (Taheripour et al., 2013b) – a fact which will have important implications for <lb/>future water consumption. <lb/>2.3. Contribution of irrigation to agricultural production, by region <lb/>Irrigation was key to the success of the Green Revolution. It contributed substantially to producing <lb/>more food by boosting yields, increasing cropping intensities (i.e., multiple crops grown sequentially on <lb/>the same land throughout the year), and enlarging cropped areas; it also enhances the use of <lb/>complementary inputs (e.g. new cultivars and agrochemicals), thus improving total factor productivity <lb/>(Evenson and Gollin 2003; Hanjra, Ferede, and Gutta 2009; Huang et al. 2006). In the next few decades, <lb/>the role of irrigation in maintaining high agricultural productivity will remain critical in the context of <lb/>growing food demand, limited resources, and more variable climate. Moreover, investment in irrigation <lb/>can have a multiplier effect – in addition to providing stable output and food at affordable prices, it <lb/>improves nonfarm employment gain, thereby boosting regional incomes and spending (Namara <lb/>et al. 2010). <lb/>In the developing world, irrigation shows a strong linkage with more productive agriculture and <lb/>poverty reduction. Based on a review of 120 studies that examine agricultural performance in South and <lb/>Southeast Asian countries, Hussain and Hanjra (2003) show that cropping intensities are generally higher <lb/>for irrigated than for rain-fed areas (111%-242% vs. 100%-168%). Besides, irrigation often leads to <lb/>higher cereal crop yield. For example, paddy rice, if it is irrigated, can yield a maximum of 5.5 tons per <lb/>hectares in the sampled fields, but without irrigation the yield rarely goes above 4 tons per hectares. A <lb/>recently released report by IFPRI (Svendsen, Ewing, and Msangi 2009) finds that irrigated yields in <lb/>Africa are typically 1.5 to 3 times of those of rainfed yields. <lb/>6 . <lb/>It should be noted that water footprint measurements do not necessarily relate to the opportunity cost of <lb/>water, which can lead to blatant misinterpretations. For instance, Anderson and Sumner (2016) show that <lb/>the actual drought-related footprint (rather than total water footprint) of a serving of beef is lower than <lb/>that of a serving of almonds or a glass of wine in the California context. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>24 <lb/>In addition to examining the direct effect of water accessibility on agriculture, a large number of <lb/>studies examine the multiplier effect that spreads the benefits of irrigation to other aspects of rural <lb/>development and to the broader economy (Hanjra, Ferede, and Gutta 2009; Mukherji and Facon 2009; <lb/>Smith 2004). Hussain and Hanjra (2003) report in their review that irrigated settings often feature higher <lb/>incomes (e.g., a 50% boost), less income inequality (the upper bound Gini of 0.53 versus 0.61 for rainfed <lb/>areas), and lower poverty prevalence (18-53% versus 21-66%). <lb/>In both developing and developed countries, the value of irrigation is also reflected in how it helps <lb/>agriculture adapt to climate variability and change. Kucharik and Ramankutty (2005) study corn yield in <lb/>counties of Nebraska and Kansas during 1947–2001, and find that irrigation reduced corn yield variability <lb/>by a factor of three. Mendelsohn and Dinar (2003) apply a Ricardian analysis to compare the sensitivity <lb/>of land value to climate. They report that countries rich in surface water resources generally have a higher <lb/>tolerance to warmer and drier weather. Besides, the value of irrigated farm land increases faster than rain-<lb/>fed farm land, probably because irrigation becomes more valuable as climate gets warmer. Recent <lb/>research by Lobell et al. (2014) highlights the rising sensitivity of non-irrigated crops to drought in the <lb/>Midwest of the US, thus emphasising the importance of supplementary irrigation. <lb/>2.4. Scope for improvements in water use efficiency <lb/>The terminology underpinning discussion of water use efficiency in the water management literature <lb/>has undergone incremental improvements since 1950s (Perry, 2007). This section focuses on two <lb/>concepts – irrigation efficiency and water productivity. Irrigation efficiency is concerned with the reliable <lb/>and precise delivery of water to plants, while water productivity describes the fraction of applied water <lb/>which is actually consumed by crops. In an economic model with water, the former speaks to irrigation <lb/>water supply, while the latter has to do with irrigation water demand, especially the demand shift induced <lb/>by technological change. The two concepts represent different approaches, but both aim to quantify the <lb/>extent to which water is used more efficiently in agriculture. <lb/>Water use efficiency is critical in determining how the goal of providing sufficient food for the <lb/>world will be achieved. Plusquellec (2002) estimates that 60% of the additional food in the next few <lb/>decades will be provided by irrigated agriculture. To support such an expansion in irrigated output, world <lb/>agriculture needs to consume additional water, or use the current extraction in a more productive way, or <lb/>both. If irrigation efficiency remains at today&apos;s level, the annual agricultural evapotranspiration may need <lb/>to double in order to feed the world in 2050. But with appropriate agricultural practices, this increase <lb/>could be held down to 60% (Rockström et al., 2007). The scope for improving irrigation efficiency and <lb/>water productivity will be discussed below. <lb/>2.4.1. Improvements to irrigation efficiency <lb/>Irrigation efficiency can be defined as the ratio of crop water requirement to irrigation water <lb/>withdrawal. Here water requirement includes both crop uptake and other beneficial uses like microclimate <lb/>cooling and salt leaching. According to the FAO, average world irrigation efficiency was around 50% in <lb/>2005/2007. In other words, about one-half of the water withdrawal is &quot; lost &quot; between the source and the <lb/>destination. Among all the regions, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest irrigation efficiency, averaging <lb/>about half of global efficiency (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). <lb/>In the context of economic analyses, irrigation use is affected both by exogenous technological <lb/>changes (pure efficiency gains) and endogenous economic responses to the ensuing changes in relative <lb/>input scarcity and profitability. In terms of production economics, exogenous technological progress <lb/>captures those factors which result in a pure outward shift of the production function. This can only be <lb/>endogenised by incorporating a link between research and development and productivity growth. On the <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>25 <lb/>other hand, changing economic conditions, and water scarcity in particular, can lead to changes in relative <lb/>input prices which also dictate improvements in water use efficiency – but this time due to new <lb/>investments based on existing knowledge. <lb/>The interplay between exogenous technological change and endogenous, profit-driven responses on <lb/>the part of individual firms can result in counter-intuitive outcomes. For example, one would expect that <lb/>the exogenous introduction of more efficient irrigation technology would conserve water use in <lb/>agriculture. However, several studies have found evidence in contrast to this widely-held belief (OECD, <lb/>2016b). For example, Pfeiffer and Lin (2014) find that farmers tended to irrigate larger areas and shifted <lb/>towards more water intensive crops after switching to a more efficient irrigation technology which proved <lb/>more profitable. In natural resource and energy economics, this phenomenon is referred to as &quot; Jevon&apos;s <lb/>paradox &quot; . This is the case where the increase in overall use, following the introduction of a new <lb/>technology, more than offsets the resource saving impact of increasing efficiency per unit of output. <lb/>Another example comes from a simulation study conducted by Ward and Pulido-Velazquez (2008) based <lb/>on the Upper Rio Grande Basin. They illustrate a situation where a drip irrigation subsidy for upper <lb/>stream irrigators reduces return flow, leading to larger depletion of downstream water. The overall <lb/>withdrawal from the basin turns out to be larger than before the subsidy for drip irrigation was provided. 7 <lb/>One implication from these cases is that, when the goal is to conserve water, technological change <lb/>needs to be accompanied by corresponding institutional and legislative changes (e.g. extraction quotas or <lb/>taxes) if one wishes to avoid expansion in overall use. Furthermore, an integrated perspective is needed in <lb/>public policy debates. Taking the Upper Rio Grande Basin study for example, upper stream farmers <lb/>definitely win with yield gains and savings in energy for pumping and delivering water, but at the cost of <lb/>impairing the water rights of downstream users. If from the national view, the evaluation should also <lb/>consider whether the net income gains can compensate the cost to taxpayers and the forgone <lb/>environmental benefits. <lb/>2.4.2. Improving the efficiency of crop utilisation of water: Water productivity <lb/>Unlike irrigation efficiency that measures the share of the diverted water finally applied to plants, <lb/>crop utilisation efficiency measures water productivity, or &quot; output per drop &quot; . More output per drop can be <lb/>achieved through two pathways – raising yields (increasing the numerator) and reducing non-beneficial <lb/>consumptive water use (decreasing the denominator). Increasing water productivity places emphasis on <lb/>agricultural practices. For example, limiting non-beneficial evaporative loss could boost yields from 1 to <lb/>3 t/ha; limiting deep percolation of rainfall could further boost yields by another 2 t/ha (Rockström et al., <lb/>2010). In other cases, the efficiency-enhancing practice may not directly relate to water. Increasing the <lb/>harvest index, better pest and disease control, and adopting drought-tolerant cultivars all contribute to <lb/>raising yield relative to evapotranspiration, and therefore result in more crop per drop. Given political-<lb/>economy issues, it may, however, not be easy for governments to re-allocate the water rights currently <lb/>assigned to high water users when these improve their management practices, and hence policies to <lb/>improve water productivity need to be well aligned with other measures to ensure that total water use is <lb/>reduced. <lb/>It is well recognised that there is considerable room to improve water productivity. Rockström et al., <lb/>(2010a) hold the view that current food security concerns related to water are not an issue of water <lb/>scarcity per se, but rather a consequence of the ineffective management of water, soils and crops. Indeed, <lb/>7 . <lb/>Water efficiency investments can also incite farmers to follow a path of specialisation in irrigated crops, <lb/>which in the end would make them more dependent on water resources and the risks associated with <lb/>climate change (OECD, 2016b). <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>26 <lb/>a number of recent findings confirm a nonlinear relationship between water productivity and yields (see <lb/>the summary in Rockström et al., 2007). At a lower level of yield, even a small yield gain can <lb/>significantly increase water productivity. But when the farm moves to a higher level of yield, water use <lb/>tends to rise in direct proportion to output, providing much less incentive for farmers to save water. The <lb/>threshold for this non-linearity is around 3 t/ha, and most small-scale farmers in developing countries <lb/>operate below this threshold, suggesting that they could significantly increase water efficiency <lb/>(Rockström et al., 2007). <lb/>2.5. Irrigation stress resulting from climate change <lb/>In the context of a changing climate, irrigated agriculture is likely to experience significant changes <lb/>due to a combination of factors affecting both the demand and supply sides (OECD, 2014). Irrigation <lb/>stress is a relative measurement, which reflects the proportion of potential irrigation demand that is <lb/>satisfied by actual water consumption. The larger is the gap between the two, the greater the stress on the <lb/>irrigated crop. It was discussed earlier in section 2.1.2 how the supply of irrigation water can be affected <lb/>by climate change. In this subsection, the emphasis is placed on the stress arising from the changing <lb/>demand for irrigation due to climate change. <lb/>The agricultural sector is highly exposed to climate change, and rising temperatures are likely to <lb/>increase the demand for water as rates of evapotranspiration rise, thereby depleting soil moisture more <lb/>rapidly. It is true that warming also tends to increase precipitation at least in some regions, but Wada et al. <lb/>(2013) argue that the enhancement of evaporative demand may outweigh the effect of increasing <lb/>precipitation under the more severe emissions scenario (e.g., above 4˚C warming), thereby leading to <lb/>larger irrigation requirements. Moreover, higher temperatures tend to reduce crop water use efficiency, <lb/>which means less beneficial consumptive use relative to the non-beneficial counterparts. <lb/>In addition to warmer temperatures, climate change is also likely to increase the variability and <lb/>occurrence of extreme events (OECD, 2014 and 2016b). For the same long-term average climatic <lb/>condition, regions with a higher inter-annual variability typically suffer more from water scarcity than <lb/>comparable regions with a more even climate (Döll 2002), thus requiring more irrigation. Where climate <lb/>change stretches the intervals between precipitation events, crops which used to be rainfed may have to be <lb/>cultivated with supplementary irrigation during the highest stress periods. Finally, climate change-<lb/>induced changes in temperature and precipitation conditions may shift the cropping calendar and growing <lb/>season. This shifts the seasonality of peak irrigation requirements, and may exacerbate the already severe <lb/>water stress during the summer and major crop growing season in some regions. <lb/>Climate change could also affect both the extensive and intensive margins of water demand for <lb/>irrigation. On the extensive margin, total demand for irrigation is driven up by the increasing area <lb/>requiring irrigation. On the intensive margin, a larger amount of water may need to be applied per hectare <lb/>per year. If represented in net terms, it is likely that the extensive margin will be less dominant. Much of <lb/>the future irrigation investment will be in rehabilitating existing systems. Döll (2002) estimates that <lb/>climate change may cause global total irrigation requirement to increase by 5-8% until the 2070s. About <lb/>two-thirds of the area equipped for irrigation in 1995 will experience an increase in irrigation demand. <lb/>Fischer et al. (2007) find an even large increase of 20% in global irrigation needs by 2080. About two-<lb/>thirds of the increase results from higher irrigation intensity. <lb/>It is important to note the considerable uncertainty associated with these estimates. The main source <lb/>of uncertainty is of course the projection of future climate (OECD, 2014). Wada et al. (2013) compare the <lb/>multi-model projections and find substantial variations among inferences derived from different climate <lb/>and hydrological models. Second, the atmospheric CO 2 enrichment effect on irrigation requirements is <lb/>still unclear. Specifically, on the one hand, a higher CO 2 concentration reduces transpiration at the leaf <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>27 <lb/>level, (the physiological effect); on the other hand, the subsequent increase in biomass leads to higher <lb/>transpiration at the regional scale (the structural CO 2 effect) (Betts et al. 1997). Which effect will be <lb/>dominant at regional and global levels remains uncertain. <lb/>2.6. Modelling irrigated cropping in a global CGE framework <lb/>2.6.1. Competition for land <lb/>Land for agriculture and forestry is typically classified into three categories – cropland, pasture land <lb/>and managed forest (Ramankutty et al. 2008). Most of the CGE models allow land use transformation <lb/>from one type to the other at some conversion cost, while keeping total land supply fixed (Hertel, Rose, <lb/>and Tol 2009). Some models (e.g., MAGNET, ENV-Linkages) focus solely on agricultural land and <lb/>allow the total supply of land to vary depending on returns to farming. Competition for land can take <lb/>place at several levels – first among broad land cover types such as crops, pasture and forestry, followed <lb/>by the competition for cropland among different crop sectors. Demand for land is typically derived from a <lb/>production function, in which land enters as an independent input with a certain degree of substitutability <lb/>with other input factors. Land use is driven by the demand for land based products, as well as the <lb/>opportunity cost of alternative uses. Global CGE models recently have paid more attention to within-<lb/>region land productivity variation and tend to limit the competition to land with similar soil quality and <lb/>growing conditions. Some commonly used classification standards are by climate zones (boreal, <lb/>temperate, and tropical) or by agro-ecological characteristics such as Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs). <lb/>An overview of land use in CGE models is provided by Hertel, Rose and Tol (2009). One commonly <lb/>applied structure designed to capture the imperfect mobility of land across uses within an AEZ is the <lb/>simple Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) function, in which an aggregate endowment of land <lb/>is transformed into different uses. The mobility of land is governed by a set of transformation parameters <lb/>that describe the responsiveness of land supply relative to returns from alternative uses. The major <lb/>problem with a CET structure is that it does not constrain the sum of actual hectares, but rather it <lb/>constrains the land rental share-weighted sum of hectares to remain constant in the aggregate. Also, this <lb/>approach does not provide an explicit link between yields and the heterogeneity of land, making it <lb/>difficult to be validated against the observed data (Hertel, Rose, and Tol 2009). An alternative approach is <lb/>represented by the AgLU model (R. Sands and Kim 2008; R. D. Sands and Leimbach 2003). AgLU <lb/>resembles a CET function in that it is subject to profit maximisation and supply response. What makes it <lb/>more appealing is the explicit modelling of yield heterogeneity and the linkage of supply response to <lb/>yield. However, AgLU is also criticised for its restrictive functional form assumption. Another approach <lb/>altogether involves the explicit modelling of conversion costs (Gurgel, Reilly, and Paltsev 2007). This <lb/>implicitly assumes that additional land can always be &apos;produced&apos; provided sufficient resources are <lb/>applied. As a consequence some kind of &apos;brake&apos; must be incorporated to prevent excessive conversion of <lb/>land in response to changing relative returns. <lb/>While the theoretical framework used to model land supply is indeed important, even more <lb/>important are the empirical estimates of land supply to which these different model structures are <lb/>calibrated. All of them seek to embody external estimates of the responsiveness of land from different <lb/>sources to a change in the relative returns to agricultural land. Yet there are very few solid estimates of <lb/>these land supply elasticities, and those that exist are typically from the more developed regions of the <lb/>world, where cropland expansion is less of a factor (Ahmed, Hertel, and Lubowski 2008). There is an <lb/>urgent need for additional empirical work on this problem. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>28 <lb/>2.6.2. Competition for water <lb/>The major interest of the CGE models concerned with water centres on the role of water as a primary <lb/>production factor, although a few exceptions examine water as a tradable good or intermediate input. <lb/>Water can be incorporated into a CGE model either implicitly or explicitly. If implicitly, the model does <lb/>not control water directly, but allocates irrigated land which itself embodies water. Modelling water <lb/>explicitly is more difficult due to the lack of information on water use, its valuation and market pricing. <lb/>Different strategies have been pursued to circumvent this challenge. The global FARM model (Darwin et <lb/>al. 1995) explicitly assigns to water a price and a value share based on estimations undertaken in the US. <lb/>Berrittella et al. (2007) use the degree of water supply falling short of demand to signal the presence of <lb/>economic rents associated with water. Recent studies argue that an increase in yield on irrigated land must <lb/>be achieved to pay for the returns to water. Thus, the shadow price corresponding to the water constraint <lb/>should be equated to the gains driven by the yield gap between irrigated and non-irrigated production <lb/>(EPPA-IRC model by Baker, 2011; GTAP-W by Calzadilla et al., 2011; GTAP-BIO-W by Taheripour et <lb/>al., 2013a). <lb/>2.6.3. Structure of the production function <lb/>In biophysically-oriented models, irrigation demand is calculated as that portion of the crop water <lb/>requirement (determined by simulation of a crop growth model) which is not satisfied by precipitation or <lb/>soil moisture (Rosegrant et al. 2008). This is further adjusted for basin efficiency, which recognises that <lb/>not all irrigation water depletion is delivered and used in a beneficial fashion. This approach to modelling <lb/>irrigation demand requires more spatially detailed data than is typically available to global CGE <lb/>modellers. It also requires the economic model to be simulated in concert with hydrological and crop <lb/>growth models. Finally, it assumes that the full irrigation requirement is supplied to the irrigated crops – <lb/>so there is no trade-off between price and quantity consumed. All of these assumptions pose problems for <lb/>a CGE model. Therefore, an alternative approach is required. <lb/>In the tradition of CGE models, irrigated agricultural production is generally represented by the <lb/>nested CES function. A very early global CGE model with water GTAP-W developed by Berrittella et al. <lb/>(2007) has a Leontief production function, which is a special case of the CES function with zero elasticity <lb/>of substitution. Water and other inputs enter into the final output production function in fixed proportion. <lb/>Sectoral demand for water responds to a water rent, which is triggered once water supply falls short of <lb/>demand. The rent increases proportionally with the water gap. <lb/>Calzadilla et al. (2011) revised the original GTAP-W model and adopt a more flexible three-level <lb/>CES production function. The bottom level combines land and irrigation water to produce an irrigable <lb/>land-water composite. In the middle, this composite is further combined with rainfed land and other <lb/>primary inputs to produce a value-added input composite. The final output is produced from aggregated <lb/>value-added and intermediates at the top level of the nesting. Such a multi-level nesting structure permits <lb/>differing degrees of substitutability between inputs at each layer. This model creates two pathways for <lb/>water to be reallocated between competing uses as water becomes scarce. One is to substitute other inputs <lb/>for water (a direct effect on water demand); the other is to reduce the demand for water-intensive products <lb/>(an indirect effect on water demand). However, this pioneering work has significant limitations. The <lb/>fundamental weakness is that rainfed and irrigated production are treated as part of the same aggregate, <lb/>national production function. So it is not possible to shut down irrigation in one region in favour of <lb/>rainfed agriculture, or expanding irrigation in another region. As will be discussed below, based on <lb/>experience with the TERM-H2O model in Australia, it appears to be the case that such a specification <lb/>results in an understatement of the potential for reductions in irrigated water use in the face of prolonged <lb/>drought. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>29 <lb/>A recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W, was introduced by Taheripour et al. (2013a). It retains <lb/>the advantages of GTAP-W, i.e. the multi-level CES structure and irrigated/rainfed crop production, but <lb/>overcomes some of its shortcomings. The most marked difference is that GTAP-BIO-W permits <lb/>competition for resources to take place at two different levels – competition for water within river basins <lb/>and competition for land within agro-ecological zones (AEZs). This design significantly improves the <lb/>adaptability of the model. For example, the irrigated and rainfed production functions operate <lb/>independently from one another. That means irrigated crop production can be completely removed from a <lb/>certain part of the country if water supply for irrigation falls short. Moreover, in GTAP-BIO-W, <lb/>intersections between different river-basins and AEZs are featured by different technologies (i.e. <lb/>production functions) that reflect water availability, growing condition and soil quality peculiar to that <lb/>area (Figure 8). <lb/>The shadow value of water in the GTAP-BIO-W model is obtain from the higher return to land in <lb/>the irrigated sector as opposed to its rainfed counterpart. This approach is founded upon the assumption <lb/>that both sectors have the same basic cost structure for non-land inputs. This follows from the assumption <lb/>of identical input-output ratios (e.g., identical kg. nitrogen fertiliser/ton of crop output) and the same non-<lb/>land input prices. Subtracting the aggregated non-land input cost share (which is therefore equal for <lb/>rainfed and irrigation agriculture) from the total (which equals one) yields the cost share of land and water <lb/>in both sectors. Further, because output per unit of land (tons of crop/hectare) is higher when irrigation is <lb/>applied, land rent per unit of irrigated land is also higher, given the same cost share of land and water. 8 <lb/>The &apos;bonus&apos; rent is then attributed to the contribution of irrigation water to total production. <lb/>Figure 8. Competition for land and water in the GTAP-BIO-W model <lb/>Source: Taheripour et al. (2013a) <lb/>8. <lb/>See the derivation in (Hertel and al., 2009). <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>30 <lb/>GTAP-W, its revised version, and GTAP-BIO-W are among the few global CGE models with water <lb/>broken out. Incorporating water into a CGE framework has been more extensively explored in studies at <lb/>country and regional level (Darwin et al. 1995; Decaluwe, Patry, and Savard 1999; Dixon, Rimmer, and <lb/>Wittwer 2011; Gómez, Tirado, and Rey-Maquieira 2004; Peterson et al. 2004; van Heerden, Blignaut, and <lb/>Horridge 2008). Most of them still favor the multi-level CES structures. Reviews of these models and the <lb/>related applications can be found in Calzadilla et al. (2011), Dudu and Chumi (2008) and Ponce et al. <lb/>(2012). Here, it is useful to draw on one of these single-region studies, namely that of Dixon et al. (2011), <lb/>who use the TERM-H2O CGE model to examine the economy-wide impacts of a water buy-back policy <lb/>in the Murray-Darling River Basin of Australia. <lb/>Figure 9 displays the key portion of a representative agricultural production in the TERM-H2O <lb/>model. Irrigated activities combine water with un-watered, irrigable land in fixed proportions to produce <lb/>irrigated land. Irrigated land substitutes for dry land (there is little of this in the irrigated sector) and un-<lb/>watered, irrigable land, which can also be used in production, albeit with much lower productivity. When <lb/>a water shortage arises, due to a temporary drought, or a permanent buy-back scheme by which the <lb/>government reduces the amount of water available for irrigation, then less irrigable land can be irrigated. <lb/>This increases the availability of un-watered, irrigable land, which is now likely to move into a dry land <lb/>sector given the prospect of rising commodity prices. The dry land sector uses no irrigated land (by <lb/>definition) but it can substitute the un-watered irrigable land for dry land, thereby expanding the area of <lb/>rainfed production. <lb/>Figure 9. Agricultural land composite in TERM-H2O <lb/>Source: Dixon et al., (2011) <lb/>It should be noted that the presence of un-watered, irrigable land in the irrigation production function <lb/>does not mean that the authors of TERM-H2O can avoid the simultaneous specification of rainfed <lb/>production sectors. Indeed, as with GTAP-BIO-W, the authors carry along in the model both rainfed and <lb/>irrigated sectors for all agricultural commodities produced in each of the model regions where irrigation is <lb/>present. However, the separate identification of currently irrigated, and potentially irrigable land, gives <lb/>their model a level of nuance which does not exist in GTAP-BIO-W. In the latter model, there are only <lb/>two types of land, with the land mobility parameter doing double-duty as a regulator of land movement as <lb/>well as irrigation preparation. In practice, obtaining separate estimates of land equipped for irrigation and <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>31 <lb/>actively irrigated land, at global scale, is not currently possible. But doing so would enrich the analysis of <lb/>water scarcity. <lb/>By separating rainfed and irrigated sectors, the authors of TERM-H2O and GTAP-BIO-W increase <lb/>the dimensions of their models considerably (2x the number of irrigated sectors). This raises a natural <lb/>question: What is gained by this added dimensionality? Some valuable insights are offered in the context <lb/>of the TERM-H2O model (Glyn Wittwer 2012). Early versions of that model did not distinguish irrigated <lb/>and dry land sectors. In the context of water availability reductions due to drought, separate analyses were <lb/>undertaken and the productivity of the agricultural sectors was exogenously shocked on that basis. The <lb/>authors found that the ensuing model greatly underestimated the observed change in composition of farm <lb/>output in response to the drought. For example, in the context of a 2002-03 drought in the Murray-Darling <lb/>Basin in which total water usage in the Basin dropped by 29%, the model predicted modest declines in <lb/>rice output and water use. However, in practice, water usage for rice production dropped by 70% during <lb/>this drought! The subsequent modifications to TERM-H2O aimed to improve on this performance by <lb/>separating irrigated and dry land activities and allowing for greater factor mobility between them (Glyn <lb/>Wittwer 2012). <lb/>3. WATER USE IN ENERGY PRODUCTION <lb/>The role of water in energy production has been attracting considerable attention recently – <lb/>particularly in the emerging economies where energy demand has been growing most strongly. Consider, <lb/>for example, the following quote from 2014 by Rachel Kyte, then World Bank Group Vice President and <lb/>Special Envoy for Climate Change: <lb/> &quot; The world&apos;s energy and water are inextricably linked. With demand rising for both resources and <lb/>increasing challenges from climate change, water scarcity can threaten the long-term viability of <lb/>energy projects and hinder development &quot; . 9 <lb/>The accompanying report notes that &quot; In the past five years, more than 50% of the world&apos;s power <lb/>utility and energy companies have experienced water-related business impacts. At least two-thirds <lb/>indicate that water is a substantive risk to business operations. &quot; In India, South Africa, Australia and the <lb/>United States, power plants have recently experienced shut-downs due to water shortages for cooling <lb/>purposes. <lb/>IEA (2012) describes the main uses of water for energy production. Panel A in Figure 10 shows the <lb/>ranges in water use and consumption for different technologies used in &quot; source-to-carrier &quot; primary energy <lb/>production, including withdrawal and consumption for extraction, processing and transport. The panel <lb/>clearly shows that water use in gas production is substantially lower than for other fossil fuels. Panel B <lb/>provides ranges for estimated withdrawal and consumption for electricity generation (excluding water use <lb/>for producing the input fuel). This panel shows how cooling technologies are essential for understanding <lb/>water use in electricity generation. <lb/></body>

Water for electricity generation by cooling technology <lb/>Source: IEA (2012), Figure 17.3 (panel A) and 17.4 (panel B) <lb/>While water is increasingly used in the extraction of fossil fuels, its main use remains in electricity <lb/>production. Hydropower is the most obvious application of water to generate electricity. However, much <lb/>of the water used to generate hydropower passes through the system and remains available for <lb/>downstream use and so it has long been thought that this source of power is not consumptive in nature. <lb/>Meldrum et al. (2013) study the life cycle water requirement of a variety of power generation <lb/>Conventional gas <lb/>Coal <lb/>Shale gas <lb/>Refined oil (conventional)* <lb/>Refined oil (oil sands)** <lb/>Gas-to-liquids <lb/>Coal-to-liquids <lb/>Refined oil (EOR)*** <lb/>Lignocellulosic ethanol**** <lb/>Palm oil biodiesel <lb/>Rapeseed biodiesel <lb/>Soybean biodiesel <lb/>Corn ethanol <lb/>Sugarcane ethanol <lb/>&lt;1 <lb/>10 1 <lb/>10 2 <lb/>10 3 <lb/>10 4 <lb/>10 5 <lb/>10 6 <lb/>10 7 <lb/>litres per toe <lb/>Withdrawal <lb/>Consumption <lb/>Wind <lb/>Solar PV <lb/>CSP* <lb/>Withdrawal <lb/>Consumption <lb/>Geothermal** <lb/>Gas CCGT <lb/>Gas CCGT <lb/>Gas CCGT (CCS) <lb/>Coal IGCC <lb/>Coal IGCC (CCS) <lb/>Fossil steam <lb/>Fossil steam (CCS) <lb/>Nuclear <lb/>Gas CCGT <lb/>Fossil steam <lb/>Nuclear <lb/>Gas CCGT <lb/>Fossil steam <lb/>Nuclear <lb/>&lt;1 <lb/>10 1 <lb/>10 2 <lb/>10 3 <lb/>10 4 <lb/>10 5 <lb/>10 6 <lb/>litres per MWh <lb/>Once-through <lb/>Cooling <lb/>pond <lb/>Cooling tower Dry Other/none <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>33 <lb/>technologies. They conclude that: &quot; water used for cooling of thermoelectric power plants dominates the <lb/>life cycle water use in most cases; the coal, natural gas, and nuclear fuel cycles require substantial water <lb/>per megawatt-hour in most cases; and, a substantial proportion of life cycle water use per megawatt-hour <lb/>is required for the manufacturing and construction of concentrating solar, geothermal, photovoltaic, and <lb/>wind power facilities. On the basis of the best available evidence for the evaluated technologies, total life <lb/>cycle water use appears lowest for electricity generated by photovoltaics and wind, and highest for <lb/>thermoelectric generation technologies. &quot; Therefore, attention is focused here on water for cooling in <lb/>thermoelectric power generation – with a particular emphasis on the emerging markets where most of <lb/>these new power plants are being constructed. Water use in hydropower production will also be <lb/>considered (for obvious reasons). Finally, water use for the growth and processing of biofuels has also <lb/>recently received increased attention. Each of these topics will be tackled in turn. <lb/>3.1. Water use for hydropower production <lb/>The revelation that hydropower production can, in some cases, result in a significant water footprint <lb/>has only recently gained traction. Indeed, in the 2011 World Congress of the International Hydropower <lb/>Association, a special session was devoted to the question: &quot; Does hydropower consume water? &quot; (M. M. <lb/>Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011). The key point is that hydro-electric dams hold water in a reservoir from <lb/>which water subsequently evaporates. The rate of evaporation depends on the temperature, moisture <lb/>content of the air and a variety of other factors which can vary significantly by location and climate. In <lb/>their study, Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011) use the Penman-Monteith equation to predict evaporation <lb/>losses for 35 hydropower facilities around the world. They find an average water &apos;footprint&apos; of hydro <lb/>power generation of 68 cubic meters/GJ of power generated. However, this varies greatly depending on <lb/>the size of the reservoir surface, relative to installed capacity. The smallest footprint is 0.3 cubic <lb/>meters/GJ in Colombia, and the largest is 846 cubic meters/GJ in Ghana. Overall, the 35 plants studied, <lb/>which account for just 8% of global capacity, have a water footprint of 90 Giga-cubic meters/year, which <lb/>is a very significant use of water. This is also a use which is unlikely to adjust in response to water <lb/>scarcity – short of dismantling the reservoir. Of course in those cases where the reservoir is also being <lb/>used for recreation, water supply or flood control, it is not appropriate to &apos;charge&apos; the hydropower <lb/>generation with all the attendant evaporation. In short, this is a dimension of water usage which is more <lb/>nuanced than conveyed by simple calculation of evaporative losses. Additional work will be required to <lb/>make a proper assessment of this aspect of water consumption by the power sector. <lb/>Implications for CGE modelling: Expansion of hydro-power in the future will depend on a host of <lb/>factors, including, suitable sites for such plants, the cost of fossil fuels and conventional power generated <lb/>based on fossil fuels, and, perhaps most significantly, environmental considerations. Construction of a <lb/>new hydro-power facility is inherently a &apos;lumpy&apos; decision, with large elements of irreversibility. For this <lb/>reason, hydro-power is likely to be scenario-driven – as opposed to a continuously variable response to <lb/>future developments in energy prices. From the point of view of water scarcity and economic growth, it is <lb/>critical to factor in the potential losses from evaporation under future scenarios involving significant <lb/>additions to (or subtractions from) hydro-power. Such estimates could be computed endogenously using <lb/>the Penman-Monteith equation, as in Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011), provided the underlying <lb/>biophysical data are available, or, more practically, one could map any new facilities to the set of 35 <lb/>facilities for which such calculations have already been done in order to get an idea of how this will likely <lb/>affect water availability downstream from the facility. <lb/>3.2. Water consumption by conventional power plants <lb/>Rapid economic growth in many developing countries is contributing to significant growth in the <lb/>demand for electricity, so this source of water demand is projected to greatly increase in the coming <lb/>decades. And it is mainly with the construction of new facilities that opportunities for significant water <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>34 <lb/>conservation arise. Therefore, the focus here is on emerging markets. Mitra and Bhattacharya (2012) <lb/>project that conventional power generation could boost its claim on total utilisable water in India from 4% <lb/>in 2010 to 20% in 2050. Since it is the choice of technique for new power plants which offers the greatest <lb/>scope for improved water use efficiency (once the plant is built, there is little scope for modification), this <lb/>section focuses on water consumption by conventional power plants in those emerging markets where <lb/>rapid growth in demand and increasing water scarcity appear to be setting the stage for a perfect storm. <lb/>India presents a particularly interesting case since it has been growing relatively rapidly and it is <lb/>destined to become the most populous country in the world (UN Population Division 2013). In response <lb/>to this rapid growth, India is expected to add considerably to its capacity for producing electric power in <lb/>the coming decades. This is important, due to the near irreversibility of conventional power generation <lb/>technologies. If India chooses a water efficient path for its new power generation capacity, this could <lb/>greatly reduce future water requirements in this sector. Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013) estimate that <lb/>simply by switching from the open loop wet cooling systems favoured historically to a more efficient, <lb/>closed loop system, India could reduce its requirements from 20% to just 7.5% of total utilisable water. <lb/>These potential water savings are a concrete manifestation of the potential for capital-water substitution of <lb/>the sort discussed in the overview section of this report. By investing more in the new technology, very <lb/>significant water savings can be achieved. However, these large gains are only economical if they are <lb/>designed in when the plant is built. <lb/>About two-thirds of the water use by a typical coal-fired thermal power plant in India is for cooling <lb/>purposes (Bhattacharya and Bijon 2013). The remaining uses for water include: ash-handling (25%) and <lb/>service and potable water (5%), together with a few residual uses. Focusing on water for cooling, turn to <lb/>Figure 10, taken from Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013), which outlines the cooling technologies available <lb/>to those investing in electric power generation capacity in India today. As those authors point out, new <lb/>open loop (once-through) cooling technologies, which return the water to its source following its use as a <lb/>coolant, have been banned since 1999. So, while some are still in use, this is no longer an option for new <lb/>plants. Of the closed loop systems, there are two main alternatives: wet and dry cooling. The wet cooling <lb/>technology circulates water in a cooling tower where evaporation occurs, resulting in cooling of the <lb/>circulated water. The dry cooling systems rely on air circulation to cool the water so that they avoid the <lb/>evaporative losses associated with the wet cooling system. This results in very large reductions in water <lb/>requirements. <lb/>Figure 11. <lb/>Electric power generation cooling technologies available in India <lb/>Source: Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013), Figure 14 <lb/>Implications for CGE modelling: In order to capture the key aspects of water use in electric power <lb/>generation described above, there are two critical requirements in a CGE model. The first is a distinction <lb/>between old and new capital – often described as a &apos;putty-clay&apos; model. In the case of the existing power <lb/>Natural draft <lb/>Cooling <lb/>technologies <lb/>Open loop <lb/>Closed loop <lb/>Wet cooling <lb/>Dry cooling <lb/>Hybrid <lb/>system <lb/>Induced <lb/>draft <lb/>Direct <lb/>Indirect <lb/>Natural draft <lb/>Induced <lb/>draft <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>35 <lb/>plant infrastructure, there is little that can be done to conserve water use. However, for new power plants, <lb/>modest increases in capital expenditures can result in significant water savings, as one moves from open <lb/>to closed loop systems and from wet to dry cooling technologies. Using the estimates taken from <lb/>Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013), Figure 11 is created which shows a marginal cost of abatement schedule <lb/>to which a CGE model could readily be calibrated. This schedule passes through two points (wet cooling <lb/>and dry cooling), exhibits the desired convex structure, and could include an asymptote reflecting the <lb/>physical limits on water conservation in such a power plant. <lb/>Given the cost shares of capital and water in the initial data base, one can choose the elasticity of <lb/>substitution between capital and water to mirror this abatement cost curve. (This is most readily achieved <lb/>by simulating the CES function in &apos;partial equilibrium&apos; mode, i.e. as a cost minimisation problem, with <lb/>output level and input prices fixed. See Golub et al. (2009) for examples in the context of GHG <lb/>mitigation costs.) In this way, as water becomes scarce, the model will capture endogenous switching to <lb/>greater water use efficiency. Of course, at the plant level this is a discrete choice and therefore will not <lb/>resemble Figure 11. However, the continuum of possibilities shown in Figure 11 is more appropriate <lb/>given the distribution of power plants in India – some using the old technologies and some using the new <lb/>technologies. It is also likely that any adoption will not occur all at once. Indeed, this technology choice is <lb/>really only possible when new plants are being built. Given the shape of the curve in Figure 11, it appears <lb/>that very substantial gains in water use efficiency are available at modest cost in the electric power sector <lb/>in India. For this reason, trend projections based on current water intensities are surely overly pessimistic <lb/>and not very useful for serious economic analysis. <lb/>Figure 12. <lb/>Marginal cost of water conservation in the electric power sector in India <lb/>Source: Authors&apos; construction, based on data from Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013) <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>36 <lb/>3.3. Water for biofuels <lb/>The most important contribution of water to the production of biofuels is through the production of <lb/>the feedstock. Gerbens-Leenes et al. (2009) explore the water footprint of biofuels for transportation <lb/>under the IEA&apos;s Alternative Policy Scenario. By current standards, this looks like a high-end scenario, <lb/>with 11% of global energy consumption in 2030 supplied by bioenergy. Bioenthanol and biodiesel <lb/>dominate the IEA projections, with USA and Brazil leading ethanol consumption in 2030, followed by <lb/>China and then Germany. Biodiesel consumption is led by Malaysia, followed by USA, France and <lb/>China, in that order. Overall, this scenario appears to be more indicative of the biofuels boom years of <lb/>2006 – 2011 than of the current era, which is characterised by waning interest in biofuels in the EU and <lb/>the USA where mandates are being rolled back in light of flat prices for fossil fuels and growing <lb/>environmental concerns about biofuels. Nonetheless, the calculations by Geerbens-Leenes et al. (2009) <lb/>are instructive, and, given the right combination of high oil prices and climate regulation, this scenario <lb/>could once again become likely. Based on this IEA scenario, the authors find that biofuels could boost <lb/>their blue water footprint from 0.5% of available blue water worldwide to 5.5% of available water by <lb/>2030. This tenfold increase is quite striking and reflects a strong utilisation of irrigation assumed by the <lb/>authors. <lb/>3.4. Implications for CGE modelling <lb/>Unlike the study by Geerbens-Leenes et al. (2009), global CGE models offer the possibility to <lb/>endogenise production, consumption and trade in biofuels. If future oil prices remain flat, and biofuel <lb/>mandates are reduced, then the amount of feedstock required for biofuels in 2030 may be very modest. <lb/>This, in turn, will reduce the blue water footprint of biofuels. Similarly, by endogenising the choice of <lb/>technique for production of the feedstocks, a CGE model can allow the extent of irrigation to be <lb/>determined by the model as a function of future water scarcity, as well as competition for land with food <lb/>crops. Therefore, to capture the water footprint of biofuels, the main requirement is to do a good job <lb/>modelling crop production, including the irrigation choice, as well as the competition between biofuels <lb/>and petroleum in the transportation sector which will ultimately determine the penetration of biofuels in <lb/>this sector. <lb/>4. RESIDENTIAL DEMAND FOR WATER <lb/>When compared to other sectors, the residential demand for water in industrialised countries is <lb/>relatively well understood. This is due in large part to the ready availability of data on quantity consumed <lb/>and pricing of water from public utilities. Water use by households is highly seasonal, with outdoor water <lb/>requirements peaking in the summer, and during the times of day/week, when household members are at <lb/>home (Parker and Wilby 2013). So the challenge, as with electric utilities, is to design a system to meet <lb/>these peak demands. <lb/>4.1. Residential Demand in Industrialised Economies <lb/>Residential demand for water can be broken into indoor and outdoor demand. Outdoor demand for <lb/>water is quite sensitive to the type of landscape in place, and there is often great scope for reducing this <lb/>type of water use, as currently observed in California. The three most important end uses of indoor water <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>37 <lb/>are toilets, showers and washers (Mayer and DeOreo 1999) and some studies focus specifically on these <lb/>end uses. Lee et al. (2011) examine the impact of water conservation practices in Miami-Dade county on <lb/>these and other household end uses of water and find that this program, which focused on getting high <lb/>efficiency appliances into households had a very significant impact on household water consumption. <lb/>This suggests that the price elasticity of demand for household water consumption is likely significant – <lb/>as households appear to have considerable scope for achieving water conservation, given sufficient <lb/>economic incentive. Due to the high level of aggregation in CGE models, this kind of summary measure <lb/>of price response will be more useful than end-use specific information. Therefore, it is useful to review <lb/>the evidence on the price elasticity of demand for water in residential use. <lb/>There are now a large number of published econometric studies of the price elasticity of demand for <lb/>water in residential use. Griffin (2006) summarises the results of these studies in the following histogram, <lb/>which reports the number of estimates falling within each range. (He first eliminates the outliers.) The <lb/>average of these estimates is -0.38, with a most likely range between -0.35 and -0.45. Griffin also <lb/>distinguishes between short and long run responses – the latter factoring in households&apos; capital stock <lb/>response to sustained price changes. After examining the literature, he suggests adding 0.2 to 0.3 points to <lb/>the elasticity to account for these long run changes. This gives a long run (capital stock fully adjusted) <lb/>household price elasticity of demand for water of -0.55 to -0.75. <lb/>Figure 13. <lb/>Distribution of estimates of residential price elasticity of demand for water (number of <lb/>estimates falling within a given interval) <lb/>Source: Griffin (2006) <lb/>4.2. Residential Demand in Developing Economies <lb/>While residential water demand in the industrialised countries is reasonably well understood, the <lb/>same cannot be said of household water demand in the developing countries. This is due to the fact that, <lb/>in low income countries, households have access to multiple sources of water, including tap water, wells, <lb/>water vendors, tanker trucks, rainwater and surface water collected from streams, etc. (Nauges and <lb/>Whittington 2012). Thus it is unclear what price the household actually pays for the water (much of the <lb/>cost may be attributable to labour) and the quantity consumed is also much more difficult to measure than <lb/>in the industrialised countries. <lb/>Nauges and Whittington (2012) suggest dividing consumers in developing countries into three broad <lb/>groups for purposes of demand analysis. The first group comprises the emerging middle class and upper <lb/>income urban residents, who have, or will soon have, access to indoor tap water and therefore are likely to <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>38 <lb/>be moving in the direction of industrialised country demands. The second group comprises the slum <lb/>dwellers who have inadequate water and sewerage services and obtain their water from a variety of <lb/>sources. In this case, it may be a long time before they have access to municipal water services and so <lb/>public sector pricing of water is likely to have less impact on them. Key factors in their consumption <lb/>decisions will likely be the opportunity cost of their time, as well as the price charged by private water <lb/>vendors. The third group are the rural poor, who are generally underserved and also often the object of <lb/>misguided, large scale water projects which are costly and deliver services which rural households often <lb/>don&apos;t want and can&apos;t maintain (Nauges and Whittington 2012). <lb/>While estimation of water demand in the context of developing countries is extremely challenging, <lb/>Nauges and Whittington (2012) conclude their survey by suggesting that &quot; most estimates of own-price <lb/>elasticity of water from private connections are in the ranges from -0.3 to -0.6, close to what is usually <lb/>reported for industrialised countries &quot; (p.264). Those authors conclude their survey by highlighting the <lb/>need to understand the potential role of dual use networks – one network for drinking water and one for <lb/>low-quality uses. <lb/>4.3. Implications for CGE modelling <lb/>In principle, it is relatively straightforward to incorporate existing estimates of the price elasticity of <lb/>the residential demand for water into a CGE model. To do so, one needs a functional form with sufficient <lb/>flexibility to accommodate this information. The Constant Difference in Elasticities expenditure function <lb/>is one such option (Hanoch 1975). In this case one would like to calibrate the model to match the long run <lb/>price elasticity of demand if the goal was to undertake long run growth analysis. The CDE functional <lb/>form has been successfully employed in the GTAP model over the past two decades (Hertel 1997). <lb/>As an alternative, or perhaps in addition to the specification of a household consumption response to <lb/>water prices, it could be useful to treat water consumption as part of a household production function. In <lb/>this case, residential consumers would invest in household appliances – with attendant implications for <lb/>energy and water use efficiency, and then consume the services supplied by this capital stock. In the <lb/>context of a putty-clay model, such a specification would allow for incorporation of the distinction <lb/>between short and long run demand responses to water price changes highlighted by Griffin. In the short <lb/>run there would be limited substitutability between water and other consumption items, but in the long <lb/>run appliance choice (household capital stock replacement) would have a more profound impact on water <lb/>conservation. <lb/>Another important lesson from this review is the potential value of disaggregating households in <lb/>developing countries. As Nauges and Whittington (2012) point out, rural and urban households have very <lb/>different water consumption requirements and the supply of that water has quite different characteristics. <lb/>Therefore, as demographic change occurs, and the mix of rural and urban households evolves, so too, will <lb/>the characteristics of aggregate residential demand for water. Breaking out the third group (slum dwellers) <lb/>would likely be more challenging. Another possibility would be to have a separate module outside of the <lb/>CGE model which can be used to develop long term projections of household water use and provide an <lb/>overall summary measure of price response for use in the CGE model. Once the model solution is <lb/>obtained, one could return to the water consumption module to deduce the impact on rural and urban <lb/>households. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>39 <lb/>5. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEMAND FOR WATER <lb/>5.1. Commercial water demand <lb/>As noted by Griffin (2006), industrial and commercial water demand is much less intensively studied <lb/>than residential demand. In the case of commercial demand, while these establishments generally obtain <lb/>their water from a public utility, the heterogeneity of operations makes estimation of demand difficult in <lb/>this case. By way of example, Kim and McCuen (1979) highlight the importance of gross store area, <lb/>length of display windows and drinking fountains in predicting commercial water use. This is a level of <lb/>detail that is not available to global CGE modellers. Furthermore, even this detailed study did not include <lb/>estimates of price response. Yet, the rapid growth of the service sector means that it will become <lb/>increasingly important in overall water use and so its economic behaviour in the face of water scarcity <lb/>will become increasingly significant. Lacking further information, it seems most reasonable to adapt price <lb/>elasticities of demand from residential use, as many of the same appliances will be important in <lb/>commercial use. <lb/>5.2. Industrial water demand <lb/>In the case of industrial demand, the challenge lies in the fact that factories are often &apos;self-supplied&apos;, <lb/>investing in their own infrastructure to access surface or ground water for use in their production <lb/>processes. Therefore, water use is not monitored, and the relevant price for the water consumed is <lb/>unobserved. In addition, much of the industrial demand is used for cooling purposes, so that the water <lb/>flows through the facility and is potentially available for other, downstream uses. Thus it is common in <lb/>global simulation models to omit the price responsiveness of industrial water demand altogether, as in the <lb/>IMPACT-WATER model (Mark W. Rosegrant et al. 2008). <lb/>When it comes to consumptive uses, many different production processes rely on some form of <lb/>steam. Masanet and Walker (2013) investigate in detail the opportunities for reducing steam requirements <lb/>– which has the great advantage of also reducing energy requirements (since energy is required to convert <lb/>water to steam) – in the major steam-using sectors of the manufacturing economy: chemicals, paper, <lb/>petroleum refining and food production. They find ample opportunities for harvesting &apos;low-hanging fruit&apos; <lb/>and significantly reducing energy and water usage in these sectors through more efficient use of steam in <lb/>manufacturing. <lb/>What these more efficient engineering processes imply for price responsiveness of the sector is a <lb/>more challenging question. The approach to demand analysis in the case of industrial use is often through <lb/>mathematical programming of the industrial operation (Griffin 2006). Such studies may or may not report <lb/>the implied price elasticity of demand. Griffin (2006) has compiled the following table for industrial and <lb/>commercial price elasticities of demand, based on the work of Renzetti (2002a). For purposes of CGE <lb/>modelling, the most appealing estimates are those undertaken at the two-digit SIC level which range from <lb/>-0.15 to -0.59 (see also Renzetti (1992)). <lb/>5.3. Implications for CGE modelling <lb/>It is relatively straightforward to &apos;nest&apos; water in a CES production function in order to elicit a given, <lb/>output-constant demand response to water prices. A key question is: how should this nesting be done? In <lb/>many cases conservation of industrial water also results in conservation of energy, suggesting that for <lb/>some industries these two inputs might be bundled together. And much like energy conservation, <lb/>improved water efficiency is typically obtained through capital investments. Therefore, nesting water with <lb/>capital, much as is currently done in energy-oriented CGE models makes sense. Furthermore, allowing <lb/>some differentiation between short run (clay) and long run (putty) responses would seem appropriate. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>40 <lb/>6. ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS <lb/>It is widely recognised in the water modelling literature that environmental uses of water are of <lb/>critical importance and that outcomes such as biodiversity, depend not only on the total volume of water, <lb/>but also on the timing and magnitude of high and low flow events (Bell et al. 2014). These can include <lb/>both in-stream uses, as well as out-of-stream diversion of water into wetlands. However, the portion of <lb/>river flow to be set aside for environmental requirements varies greatly across studies, ranging from 10% <lb/>in the case of IMPACT-WATER (Mark W. Rosegrant and The IMPACT Development Team 2012) to as <lb/>much as 50% in the IWMI analysis of Smakhtin et al. (2004). The latter team of authors argue that &quot; the <lb/>services that freshwater ecosystems provide to humans … are worth trillions of US dollars annually &quot; . <lb/>They go on to estimate the global distribution of Ecological Water Requirements (EWR) as a percentage <lb/>of long term mean annual river flow, and this is reproduced in Figure 13. They acknowledge that this <lb/>calculation is extremely simplistic and that much more information must be brought to bear before <lb/>measures which can inform management decisions are brought to bear at global scale. <lb/>Implications for CGE Modelling: From a CGE modelling perspective, it would be attractive to move <lb/>beyond the current approach in which some, apparently arbitrary, percentage of stream flow is set aside as <lb/>an environmental reserve. A natural way to begin to incorporate the trade-off between environmental <lb/>quality and the consumption of other goods and services would be to bring these environmental services <lb/>into the utility function. One approach, taken by Tsigas et al. (2001) involves specifying a total <lb/>endowment of environmental quality (in this case, that obtained from maximum stream flow) and then <lb/>accounting for the use of some of this environmental good (stream flow) for other purposes. What <lb/>remains is &apos;consumed&apos; by households as an in-stream use of the water. In the initial equilibrium, this in-<lb/>stream use may not be priced – but rather provided by the government as part of its public services. This <lb/>specification allows for explicit competition between environmental and commercial uses of water and <lb/>captures the welfare benefits of improved environmental quality as some of the water is left in-stream for <lb/>environmental &apos;consumption&apos; by households. However, the implementation challenge for such extensions <lb/>is to properly parameterise the utility function. Further empirical work will be required before such <lb/>approaches will be widely accepted. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>41 <lb/>Figure 14. <lb/>Ecological water requirements as a percentage of long term mean annual river flow <lb/>Source: Smaktin et al. (2004) <lb/>7. WATER SUPPLY AND ALLOCATION <lb/>7.1. Reuse of water <lb/>Water is rarely fully consumed in its various uses. Rather, some of the water withdrawn for a <lb/>particular use is released and becomes a candidate for re-cycling and reuse. Seckler et al. (1998) conclude <lb/>their report on the future of water supply and demand by suggesting that water reuse may be one of the <lb/>most important sources of water supply in the coming decades. One of the main barriers to water reuse is <lb/>pollution, which can build up rapidly as water is recycled. Therefore, the authors emphasise (p. 18) that <lb/> &quot; pollution control is one of the most basic ways of increasing water supply &quot; . In contrast, they find that, at <lb/>the time of their writing (1998), most international data sets &quot; simply assumed that once water is <lb/>withdrawn it is lost to further use &quot; . This clearly leads to an understatement of water availability. <lb/>Luckman et al. (2014) take account of water reuse in their analysis of water shortages in Israel. Their <lb/>modelling of reuse suggests a useful way forward for incorporating this aspect of water into a global CGE <lb/>model. A first step is that, rather than having just one type of water, one must distinguish multiple types, <lb/>of which only one is freshwater. The other types relate to joint products of water-using sectors. Thus the <lb/>residential sector might produce a type of effluent which, after suitable processing, might be reused as <lb/>potable water, or perhaps water suitable for irrigation. Given their research on Israel, those authors also <lb/>consider seawater as an input to the desalinisation industry, which, in turn produces potable water. They <lb/>also include brackish groundwater in their model, which is suitable for some uses. In short, adding more <lb/>types of water to reflect these differing qualities and allowing sectors to draw on, and add to, these <lb/>different water resources, as appropriate, results in a much richer treatment of the resource. Luckman et <lb/>al. (2014) find that the intensities of use of these different types of water vary greatly across sectors, and, <lb/>in many cases, they substitute in use. Thus when freshwater supplies are restricted, there is some potential <lb/>for shifting to other types of water, albeit at higher cost. In their study, they consider the impacts of <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>42 <lb/>reducing freshwater availability by 50%, with desalinisation as one option for bridging some of the <lb/>ensuing shortfall. Due to its high cost, the provision of desalinisation in this case does little to mitigate the <lb/>negative outcomes of the water shortfall. <lb/>7.2. Economy-wide water Supply <lb/>As previously noted, in the IMPACT-WATER model, surface water availability is determined by <lb/>runoff within the river basin, as well as inflow from the upstream basins (Rosegrant et al., 2012). In <lb/>deference to environmental, ecological and navigational needs, only a portion of this total surface water <lb/>flow is available to agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial demands. Groundwater availability <lb/>is dictated exogenously based on historic pumping rates and potential groundwater sources and recharge <lb/>rates. A storage model is used to smooth out water consumption at monthly duration. How should water <lb/>supply be handled in the context of a global CGE model? <lb/>A first question is that of regional detail. How much is required? Clearly more detail is better, as <lb/>acute water shortages tend to be seasonal and local. But at some point the costs of disaggregation exceed <lb/>the benefits. Figure 14 taken from Liu et al. (2014) sheds some useful light on this question. This maps <lb/>the world&apos;s major river basins and colour codes them according to projected water scarcity for irrigation <lb/>in 2030. These results are taken from the IMPACT-WATER model (Mark W. Rosegrant et al. 2013) in <lb/>which irrigation is the residual claimant on water use, so this index of water availability is a good <lb/>indicator of overall water scarcity in the river basin. The first point to note is that water scarcity is not a <lb/>global phenomenon; rather, it is concentrated in certain regions. Furthermore, these regions do not <lb/>necessarily coincide with national boundaries. In China, for example, the northeast shows significant <lb/>water scarcity, but the Southeast does not. Similarly, the impacts in South Asia are also markedly <lb/>different within the sub-regional boundaries. In short, it appears to be quite important that water supplies <lb/>be modelled at the river basin level, as opposed to the national scale, as might normally be done in a <lb/>global CGE model. <lb/>Figure 15. <lb/>Projected adequacy of water for irrigation in 2030, based on simulations of the IMPACT-WATER <lb/>model <lb/>Source: Authors calculations, based on Rosegrant et al. (2013) <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>43 <lb/>A second question which arises in the context of CGE modelling of water scarcity and economic <lb/>growth is whether or not to model the hydrological processes underpinning water supply. Since <lb/>&apos;unassisted&apos; water naturally flows downhill, a &apos;flow routing model&apos; is required to understand how <lb/>different users are spatially connected with supplies. However, it is common in economic models to use <lb/>the &apos;tank modelling&apos; approach in which routing is ignored (Bell et al. 2014). In our opinion, this is better <lb/>left outside the model, with hydrological experts producing estimates of water availability at the river <lb/>basin level. Of course, these estimates will depend to some degree on growth rates in the global economy, <lb/>and these assumptions should be synchronised between the two models. <lb/>Once overall water availability at the river basin level has been determined, there remains the <lb/>question of how this water gets supplied to users. Residential, commercial, and, to some extent industrial <lb/>users in the typical industrialised economy will obtain their water from a municipal utility. The municipal <lb/>supply of water to these sectors can be modelled via a production function of the usual sort. The cost <lb/>shares for this activity should be available from the national input-output table or social accounting <lb/>matrix. Valuing the water input into this public utility will be a challenge, and will ultimately require an <lb/>assumption about the price of water in the region. This &apos;raw water&apos; input may come from either surface <lb/>water or ground water and its overall availability will be derived from the hydrological model. <lb/>A further challenge for CGE models is how to spatially allocate the non-agricultural water uses. <lb/>Distributing manufacturing and service activities across river basins globally would present a major <lb/>challenge. Therefore, it is probably easiest to simply require that non-agricultural demands at the river <lb/>basin scale move in fixed proportion to national activity levels, so these can be viewed as inputs into the <lb/>single, national production function. <lb/>Finally, there is the question of how to model ground water and surface water supplies. Diao et al. <lb/>(2008) seek to model the conjunctive use to ground and surface water supplies in the context of a CGE <lb/>model of the Moroccan economy. They point out that ground water has a clear buffering value when <lb/>surface water supplies are uncertain and that it is important to incorporate both ground and surface water <lb/>as distinct sources of water supply into any economy-wide analysis. <lb/>In the context of a recursive-dynamic analysis, the supply of surface water to agriculture will depend <lb/>on pre-existing investments in reservoirs, canals and delivery systems which can be reflected with the <lb/>presence of a fixed factor in the supply function describing the transformation of raw water into irrigated <lb/>water. Groundwater supplies are largely dependent on energy costs, which will increase as the depth of <lb/>groundwater wells increases. The supply of groundwater to agricultural irrigation can be modelled using a <lb/>production function which combines capital, labour and energy with the ground water endowment. As <lb/>this endowment is drawn down, the effect on costs can be simulated as non-water, input-using adverse <lb/>technical change, so that to deliver the same amount of irrigation, more inputs are required. The stock of <lb/>groundwater will be a function of pumping as well as the rate of recharge. Calculation of the latter will <lb/>require use of a hydrological model and will therefore need to be done outside the CGE model. Given the <lb/>differing characteristics of water supplied from surface and ground sources, and in the absence of a more <lb/>elaborate model of conjunctive use, it is appealing to treat these two sources of water as imperfect <lb/>substitutes in the irrigation production function, as proposed by Sue-Wing and Lanzi (2014). <lb/>7.3. Allocation across sectors <lb/>In the physical science literature, research related to the themes of water availability and allocation <lb/>aspects usually leans heavily on hydrological modelling (e.g. the LPJmL model by Gerten et al. (2004), <lb/>CLIRUN-II by Strzepek et al. (2011) and WGHM by Döll et al. (2003)) or water management models <lb/>(e.g. GCWM by Siebert and Döll (2010) and IWSM by Zhu et al. (2013)). The common interest shared <lb/>by this community is the quantity (and sometimes quality) of water resource. The economic literature, <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>44 <lb/>however, provides a different perspective that focuses more on the value of water. In many ways the <lb/>modelling of water demands supplies is no more challenging than many of the other demand and supply <lb/>relationships in the economy. The real challenge in modelling water has to do with determining its <lb/>allocation across uses. As pointed out by Olmstead (2013) water is not typically allocated through <lb/>markets. Even in OECD countries, a wide diversity of water allocation regimes are applied (OECD, <lb/>2015b). This poses a challenge for modellers. For example, in the IMPACT-WATER model (Rosegrant et <lb/>al., 2012), water is allocated in a sequential fashion, with residential needs satisfied first, followed by <lb/>industrial and livestock demands. Irrigation needs are treated as a residual claimant on available water. <lb/>This seems most appropriate in the short-to medium term. <lb/>Olmstead (2013) emphasises the importance of thinking carefully about how the institutions <lb/>governing water allocations will respond to water scarcity. And for this, some knowledge of the <lb/>underlying institutions and associated allocation rules is required. She identifies the following <lb/>institutional adaptations which could be beneficial in the context of increasing water shortages: legal <lb/>changes to water rights regimes, water banking, leasing and marketing, negotiated transfers, investment in <lb/>infrastructure for storage (transfer across time) and transport (transfers across space) of water, and last, <lb/>but not least --water pricing. Such institutional changes become more likely over the long run. <lb/>From a policy perspective, water variability may be an even more relevant driver of the link with <lb/>economic growth than absolute scarcity (OECD, 2015c). This also affects the perspective on policy issues <lb/>ranging from infrastructure design to water allocation regimes; OECD (2015b) provides a useful health <lb/>checklist on this topic. <lb/>Where water is allocated on the basis of historical rights and political influence, very large price <lb/>differentials can emerge across sectors. Olmstead (2013) notes that water prices in the neighbourhood of <lb/>Tucson, Arizona vary from USD 27/acre-foot for agriculture to as much as USD 3,200/acre-foot in urban <lb/>uses. While some of this can be explained by the nature and quality of the product being delivered, most <lb/>of this hundred-fold difference is a function of institutions which do not allocate water based on economic <lb/>criteria. In discussion of the treatment of water in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), she suggests <lb/>undertaking a sort of &apos;bounding analysis&apos; wherein one set of simulations is conducted assuming no <lb/>change in allocation rules, while another might assume perfect adaptation. Of course, given the size of <lb/>these distortions, one suspects that the impact of reforming the institutions leading to these perverse <lb/>allocation rules will have a much larger impact than will the anticipated water scarcity itself. <lb/>The prospect of water scarcity creating incentives for the reform of water allocation rules and <lb/>institutions is an intriguing prospect when it comes to the impact of water scarcity on economic growth. <lb/>Olmstead (2013) suggests that &quot; while water prices, on the whole, do not seem to be higher in more arid <lb/>regions, water marketing is more prevalent in arid regions. In a Coasian sense, the mere existence of the <lb/>potential gains from trading water creates pressure for trade to occur, so long as the property rights are <lb/>clearly assigned. &quot; In Chile, Australia and the Western US, water trading has evolved in direct response to <lb/>scarcity (Olmstead 2013). The National Water Code established in Chile in 1981 separated water rights <lb/>from land rights and allowed the water rights to be traded. The response has been significant in the north-<lb/>Central region (Bauer 2004). In Australia, water trading was introduced over the course of three decades, <lb/>beginning in 1983 with South Australia. This appears to have generated positive economic responses in <lb/>the form of increased &apos;value per drop&apos; through more efficient technologies and a shift to higher value <lb/>crops (Bjornlund and McKay 2002). <lb/>The idea that agriculture is likely to be the sector relinquishing water in the presence of future <lb/>scarcity is further underscored in the study by McKinsey and Company which compiled a marginal cost <lb/>of water availability schedule for the Indian economy. This is portrayed in Figure 15 which identifies <lb/>water conservation measures in agriculture, industry and residential/commercial uses, along with potential <lb/>supply-enhancing measures which could help to close the projected gap between water requirements and <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>45 <lb/>available supplies in 2030. The first thing to note is the predominance of agricultural conservation <lb/>measures at the lower end of this cost curve. Indeed, one-third of the projected deficit in 2030 comprises <lb/>&apos;no regrets&apos; policies – changes in behaviour which will actually save money! These include the <lb/>introduction of no-till farming, reducing over-irrigation and optimising the use of fertiliser on irrigated <lb/>fields. About two-thirds of the gap can be closed with agricultural adaptations with modest cost (less than <lb/>USD 0.02/cubic meter, such as drip irrigation, and improved management of irrigated crops. In order to <lb/>fully close the projected gap of more than 700 billion cubic meters in 2030, some supply measures are <lb/>envisioned, including improving infrastructure in the &apos;last mile&apos; of delivery and the development of small <lb/>scale supply infrastructure. Conservation measures in municipal and domestic use are far more costly and <lb/>therefore unlikely to come into the optimal mix of policies. <lb/>Figure 16. <lb/>Cost of increasing water availability in India in 2030 through conservation and supply <lb/>considerations <lb/>Source: Reproduced from McKinsey &amp; Co. (2009) <lb/>Of course, any time water is withdrawn from agriculture, there will likely be adverse rural impacts, <lb/>unless households and communities are compensated for the loss of these implicit subsidies. In their <lb/>analysis of intersectoral water competition in South Africa, Hassan and Thurlow (2011) find that a policy <lb/>scenario in which water is allowed to move to higher value uses in the urban, industrial and domestic <lb/>sectors reduces rural incomes and employment – particularly for the poorest households. Clearly such <lb/>reforms must be accompanied by some form of compensation, decoupled from water use, if adverse <lb/>income distributional consequences are to be avoided. <lb/>7.4. Implications for CGE Modelling <lb/>Given the dominant role of irrigation in total water withdrawals in the arid regions of the world, and <lb/>given the extremely low price charged for this water in most cases, it seems logical that agriculture is <lb/>likely to absorb a large share of future water deficits. This suggests a baseline modelling strategy akin to <lb/>that of the IMPACT-WATER group in which non-agricultural water use is determined based on projected <lb/>economic growth and municipal water pricing policies. After running the hydrological model to <lb/>determine availability at the river basin level, agriculture might be forced to adjust to any ensuing <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>46 <lb/>scarcity. This baseline scenario could be contrasted with an efficient allocation scenario in which the price <lb/>of raw water is equated across sectors. <lb/>There are several important issues which a global CGE analysis is likely to have great difficulty in <lb/>addressing. One of these has to do with return flows. Industrial water is often discharged into streams and <lb/>rivers. Irrigation water not lost through evapotranspiration may recharge aquifers or add to surface water <lb/>availability. Proper analysis of these return flows requires considerable spatial detail. And subsequent use <lb/>of these return flows may require water treatment, in which case one needs to worry about water quality, <lb/>not just quantity. Studies which ignore the potential for recycling of water, invariably underestimate water <lb/>supply. Luckman et al. (2014) make a good start at dealing with reuse by differentiating between seven <lb/>different types of water, some of which are naturally occurring endowments, some of which are outputs <lb/>and some of which are by-products of individual sectors. Of course, finding the data to underpin such <lb/>analysis of reuse at the global scale is likely to be difficult, as pointed out by Seckler et al. (1998). <lb/>Another aspect of global water scarcity which is extremely important, but also challenging to come <lb/>to grips with in a standard CGE model, is that of trans-boundary river basins. DeStefano et al. (2010) <lb/>identify 16 &apos;at risk&apos; river basins which are likely to pose particular problems in the coming decades due to <lb/>expected increases in hydrological variability and poor institutions governing international flows of water. <lb/>Ten of these are in Africa – a region already torn by strife. Analysing these flows and the resulting <lb/>tensions would be a valuable contribution, but may best be done in a regional model which combines <lb/>hydrological, climatic and economic dimensions of the problem. <lb/>8. CONCLUSIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES <lb/>8.1. Summary of Findings <lb/>The purpose of this background paper has been to survey the literature bearing on various <lb/>dimensions of water scarcity and economic growth, with an eye to the incorporation of future water <lb/>scarcity into a global CGE model such as the OECD&apos;s ENV-Linkages model. The evidence that links <lb/>water scarcity to a slow-down of the long term rate of national economic growth is still relatively scarce. <lb/>At local scale, water shortages can have a devastating impact – particularly in the near term, with power <lb/>outages, retirement of irrigated crop land and unemployment. These localised impacts suggest the need <lb/>for greater disaggregation than is usually the case in global CGE models. The minimum relevant scale <lb/>would appear to be the river basin. Implementation of a global CGE model with water demand and supply <lb/>fleshed out at the level of river basins will be a significant undertaking. However, some progress has been <lb/>made in this regard (Liu et al., 2014) and there is a great deal of existing data and modelling work outside <lb/>the CGE community which can form the foundation for such studies (e.g., Rosegrant et al. 2013). <lb/>As society looks ahead to a world of increasing water scarcity, a key factor will be the scope for <lb/>society to conserve water: (a) by increasing efficiency in existing uses (e.g. water-efficient appliances), <lb/>(b) by substituting away from water intensive production activities (e.g., shifting from irrigated to rainfed <lb/>cropping) and (c) by substituting away from water intensive consumption goods and services (e.g., green <lb/>lawns). The overall capacity of the economy to substitute increasingly abundant physical and human <lb/>capital for scarce water, is captured by the elasticity of substitution between these two inputs, s . If <lb/>technology and preferences result in a value of <lb/>1 <lb/>  , then as water becomes more scarce, the associated <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>47 <lb/>economic rents will claim a larger and larger share of GDP. Eventually this could become a significant <lb/>drag on the economy. In the literature review provided here, it appears that, at the level of individual <lb/>sectors, this relatively inelastic response to water scarcity is indeed prevalent. However, it remains to be <lb/>seen what scope there is for the economy to substitute more aggressively away from water intensive <lb/>activities and consumption goods. Quantifying this potential should be part of the research agenda <lb/>undertaken with the kind of global CGE model discussed in this report. <lb/>Having flagged the potential for water scarcity to become a brake on economic growth, it should also <lb/>be pointed out that water use is by no means destined to grow in proportion to population and/or output. <lb/>Indeed, in reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across <lb/>the board are striking, including in the electric power sector, the production of industrial steam, residential <lb/>consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not <lb/>been more widespread to date is due to the absence of economic incentives for conservation. In many uses <lb/>around the world, water remains virtually free. And where a pricing structure does exist, it varies widely <lb/>across sectors. Indeed, one could argue that the inter-sectoral price differential for water (100x in some <lb/>places) represents one of the most extreme misallocations of a resource in the world economy today. <lb/>The presence of this large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the need for general equilibrium <lb/>analysis. Not only does the CGE approach offer estimates of the direct gains from reducing this distortion, <lb/>but it also captures how this distortion interacts with other shocks to the economy. Indeed, it is entirely <lb/>possible that, in a world of increasing water scarcity, water surplus regions could suffer efficiency losses <lb/>as a result of the interplay between these distortions and international price changes. <lb/>The presence of these large factor market distortions is a tribute to the power of the vested interests <lb/>which control existing water rights. And their resilience over time is evidence of significant political <lb/>power. However, as water scarcity becomes more severe, it is possible that these vested interests will be <lb/>overtaken by the broader national interest, and a more economically efficient allocation of water will <lb/>emerge. In this sense, the looming water crisis could actually become a growth opportunity, since <lb/>reallocating water to higher value uses could bring significant aggregate benefits. <lb/>8.2. Research Agenda <lb/>As is clear from this report, modelling the impacts of water scarcity in a global, CGE framework is <lb/>not for the faint of heart! This raises the legitimate question: Recognising that one cannot do everything at <lb/>the outset, what are the top priorities? <lb/>Firstly, it is essential to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model. It is difficult to talk <lb/>about water scarcity if this is treated as a latent factor of production, the impact of which is only felt <lb/>through changes in productivity, as has been done in some of the earlier studies. <lb/>Secondly, given the importance of reuse in the total supply picture, it would appear that treating <lb/>water as both an input and an output is warranted. Other than in the municipal water utility sector, the <lb/>water output will typically be a by-product, and, in order for it to be reused, some further processing is <lb/>required. <lb/>Thirdly, as soon as one seeks to break out an input in the social accounting matrix underpinning a <lb/>CGE model, it becomes necessary to value the flow, which takes us into the realm of water pricing and <lb/>the value of the marginal product of water in different uses. As identified in her recent review, Olmstead <lb/>(2013) highlights this as a central challenge to those currently working in this area. Such a data set on <lb/>global water prices, by sector, would be an enormously important public good, and the OECD is well-<lb/>positioned to champion such an effort. Indeed, the OECD already undertakes similar exercises for <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/>48 <lb/>agricultural subsidies (e.g, OECD, 2016a) and the IEA does so for energy prices and subsidies. Such an <lb/>activity would pair nicely with the development of a global CGE model which can utilise these data to <lb/>shed light on the interplay between future water scarcity, the allocation of resources across sectors and <lb/>countries, and long run economic growth. <lb/>Fourthly, once a data set is assembled, the minimalist model will need to differentiate between the <lb/>various classes of water uses identified above. Given its prominence in overall water withdrawals, as well <lb/>as its critical role in accommodating future scarcity in water availability, the irrigated cropping sector <lb/>demands special attention. Here, differentiation of irrigated and rainfed activities will be essential if the <lb/>model is to capture the full potential for water conversation through altering the mix of rainfed and <lb/>irrigated agriculture. Residential, commercial, industrial and electric power generation demands can be <lb/>handled in a relatively straightforward manner, with limited short run substitution possibilities, but <lb/>significant long run substitution in the context of new, more water-efficient capital stocks. In the context <lb/>of electricity generation, in addition to water consumption in the cooling processes, it will also be <lb/>important to recognise the evaporative losses which accompany hydropower generation. At the outset, <lb/>treatment of environmental demands will likely follow the literature and simply reserve a portion of in-<lb/>stream flows for these uses. <lb/>Finally, the impact of water scarcity on economic growth will depend critically on the allocation <lb/>rules chosen for dealing with scarcity. Therefore, the model should be designed in such a way as to permit <lb/>maximum flexibility in the choice of different approaches to water allocation. These might include a <lb/>cascading set of priorities, as in the IMPACT-WATER model, sub-markets wherein certain sectors <lb/>compete for residual water supply, as well as a full-blown market for water at the level of individual river <lb/>basins. Being able to analyse the distributional and efficiency impacts of alternative approaches to water <lb/>allocation will allow such a model to play an important role in future debates about water scarcity and <lb/>economic growth. <lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11 <lb/></body>
