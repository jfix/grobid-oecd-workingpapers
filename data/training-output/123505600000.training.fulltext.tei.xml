			<figure>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ<lb/> COLLECTIVE PENSION FUNDS – INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE AND<lb/> IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINA&apos;S ENTERPRISE ANNUITIES REFORM<lb/></figure>

			<p>Collective pension funds (CPFs) -occupational pension funds that cover the employees of more<lb/> than one employer (enterprise) -have been operating in OECD countries for decades. Generally<lb/> speaking, there are two models, i.e. closed pension funds, with membership restricted to a<lb/> particular industry or group of industries, and open pension funds open to all types of company.<lb/> The governance structure of such funds also operates in two ways – via an internal model (with<lb/> trustees appointed by employers and employees) and external model (with professional,<lb/> commercial trustees). In this report, we first describe and analyse how CPFs are operated in<lb/> selected OECD countries and non-OECD economies. Then, we review occupational pensions (or<lb/> Enterprise Annuities -EA-in Chinese terminology) in general and CPFs in particular. Given the<lb/> problems holding back the development of EA plans among small and medium size enterprises<lb/> (SMEs) in China, and bearing in mind both China&apos;s specific situations and international best<lb/> practices, we propose a number of policy recommendations to promote the development of CPFs<lb/> covering the SME sector. Our practical policy recommendations include 1) industry funds with<lb/> more open membership; 2) establishment of new purpose-built industry funds; 3) establishment of<lb/> new regional EA administration centres acting as independent pension councils (trustees) for open<lb/> pension funds; 4) in parallel to these policy initiatives in China, commercial trustees should be<lb/> encouraged to establish CPFs targeting the SME sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>1 Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Collective pension funds (CPFs) are independent entities containing the pool of assets acquired<lb/> for the exclusive purpose of financing pension plan benefits of employees which are not from the<lb/> same company or holding group of companies. In other words, CPFs are different from single<lb/> company (or group) pension funds, which cover only the employees of a specific enterprise (or<lb/> group of companies under the same ownership). CPFs have been operating in OECD countries for<lb/> decades, although the specific forms vary from country to country.<lb/> It is worth noting at the outset, and also for the reason of completeness, that besides the above-<lb/>mentioned pension fund structure, another form of occupational pension arrangement is also<lb/> common in some OECD countries, i.e. pension insurance contracts. A pension insurance contract<lb/> is defined as an insurance contract that specifies pension plan contributions to an insurance<lb/> undertaking in exchange for which the pension plan benefits will be paid when the members reach<lb/> a specified retirement age or on earlier exit of members from the plan 2 . Such arrangements,<lb/> however, are not discussed in this report.<lb/></p>

			<p>It should also be noted that we will discuss collective pension funds available via employment<lb/> arrangements, while personal ―retail‖ funds offered directly to individuals with no involvement of<lb/> their company or employer are not covered in this report. Finally, the ―collectivity‖ discussed in<lb/> this report is what is known in China as ―front-end collectivity‖, whereby different company<lb/> sponsors pool their contributions in a common pension fund under the responsibility of a single<lb/> board of trustees or corporate trustee company, which then selects asset managers and other<lb/> service providers if deemed necessary. Back-end (asset management) collectivity means each<lb/> single employer sets up its own pension fund with typically a fund-specific trustee board (pension<lb/> council model) and buys standardised ―collective pension products‖ from financial institutions<lb/> (e.g. asset managers).<lb/> In China, the majority of enterprise annuities (EA) plans (the term used for occupational pension<lb/> plans) are sponsored by the large and profitable state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while SMEs find<lb/> 1 The authors would like to thank delegates to the OECD Working Party on Private Pensions for useful comments and<lb/> participants in the OECD/MOLSS Meetings on 15-16 May 2007 in Beijing for constructive discussions, especially<lb/> Stephen Glenfield from APRA, Australia and Hendena Yu from MPFA, Hong Kong, China.

Recent statistics show that as of<lb/> February 2006, only 1% of the EA assets were accumulated by SMEs in China. This EA<lb/> ―vacuum‖ among SMEs is not only inconsistent with the current central government&apos;s ultimate<lb/> goal of establishing a ―harmonious society‖, but also holds back further development of the EA<lb/> market. Given these concerns, the Chinese authorities (notably the Ministry of Labour and Social<lb/> Security MOLSS) have been considering how to encourage SMEs to join EA plans via <ref type="biblio">CPFs.<lb/></ref> In this paper, we will first describe and analyse how CPFs are operated in selected OECD<lb/> countries and non-OECD member economies. The examples will not be exhaustive, as the<lb/> primary objective is to develop a solution 3 that is appropriate for China. Then, we review China&apos;s<lb/> EA market in general and CPFs in particular, highlighting the problems holding back<lb/> development of EA plans among SMEs in China. Given the specific Chinese context and bearing<lb/> in mind international practices, we will propose a number of practical policy recommendations on<lb/> how to promote and develop EA plans among SMEs in China via properly designed CPFs. Last,<lb/> we will include four annexes, covering four examples (i.e. Australia, Hong Kong, China, the<lb/> Netherlands, and the United States) promoting further detail about CPF arrangements in the<lb/> respective economies.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 Summary of CPFs in OECD countries and Hong Kong, China<lb/></head>

			<p>As given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, there are two main forms of CPFs – industry funds and master trusts, which<lb/> can be classified along two main dimensions: membership and governance. Closed pension funds&apos;<lb/> membership is restricted to specific industries, while members of open funds can come from any<lb/> company. The governance structure of collective pension funds also operates in two ways – via an<lb/> internal model (i.e. pension council in Chinese terminology), with trustees appointed by<lb/> employers and employees, and an external model (i.e. corporate trustee in Chinese terminology),<lb/> with financial institutions acting as professional, commercial trustees. One example for the former<lb/> is the industry funds which are dominant in the Netherlands and Denmark, while examples of the<lb/> latter include master trusts in OECD countries (i.e. Australia and the United States), and the<lb/> master trust schemes in Hong Kong, China.<lb/></p>

			<p>Industry funds in OECD countries have largely arisen from negotiation between trade unions and<lb/> employers, so that the collective bargaining mechanism has generally been the foundation for<lb/> setting up such funds. For example, Australian trade unions were actively involved in the design<lb/> and development of the first industry funds in the early 1980s (in conjunction with the economic<lb/> objective of containing inflationary pressures by directing a part of wage increases to long term<lb/> retirement savings). Meanwhile, for the industry funds in the Netherlands and other countries (e.g.<lb/> the United States), the strong collective bargaining mechanism between employees and employers<lb/> or their representatives has played an important role. Although industry funds have been<lb/> established in many different industries, it is observed that they are particularly popular among<lb/> two types of industry. Firstly, in traditional, manufacturing industries, such as mining, steel or<lb/> auto manufacturing. Secondly, in industries with ―mobile employees‖, i.e. those who do not stay<lb/> with the same employer for a long period of time, for example, those working in the construction,<lb/> hospitality, textile, and catering industries. Furthermore, although industry funds have been<lb/> traditionally restricted to the members belonging to certain industries, their membership was<lb/> recently extended to the general public (including SMEs) in Australia.<lb/></p>

			<p>The key advantage of the industry funds in more mobile industries has been cost efficiency for the<lb/> SMEs, largely due to economies of scale achieved by pooling pension assets together from<lb/> different businesses. SMEs would otherwise be unlikely to be able to afford setting up their own<lb/> pension plans. A second key advantage is the embedded portability for the plan members, since<lb/> they do not need to switch pension funds when they change jobs, as long as the two employers<lb/> concerned participate in the same industry fund. Another advantage of industry funds is the strong<lb/> focus on the protection of beneficiaries&apos; interests, often achieved through the equal representation<lb/> of employee and employer groups at the trustee level, without the inherent conflict between<lb/> commercial interests and fiduciary duties.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another main form of CPFs are master trusts, in which standardised investment products are<lb/> designed by financial institutions or corporate trustees and offered to any company (open<lb/> membership). The key difference here is that the trustees intend (in return for capital,<lb/> entrepreneurial, human resource and technology support) to make a profit by selling their pension<lb/> products to companies. This form of CPFs is common in OECD countries and has also become a<lb/> key component of the overall social security system in many non-OECD economies. For example<lb/> in Hong Kong, China, the master trust scheme is the typical type of master trust and accounts for<lb/> 36 out of 40 mandatory provident schemes. In the United States, financial institutions have<lb/> designed a range of collective investment products (e.g. simplified employee pension plans SEPs),<lb/> aiming to attract employers in the SME sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main merit of master trusts is that they are generally simple for employers (specially SMEs)<lb/> to join and operate. Meanwhile, the services provided by financial institutions are another<lb/> advantage, largely due to the fact that trustees are professionals with expertise in investment and<lb/> finance, and with experience in administering and managing pension funds. However, despite the<lb/> above strengths, master trusts might be disadvantaged due to the inherent conflict between<lb/> fiduciary duties and operating on a commercial basis, with employees and employers not normally<lb/> represented on the board of trustees.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Industry fund<lb/></head>

			<p>For this form of CPFs, different terms have appeared interchangeably in the literature; they are<lb/> multi-employer funds, industry funds or industry-wide funds. In this report, we do not distinguish<lb/> them unless specified otherwise.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.1 Characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>The typical form of industry funds covers employees of enterprises that do not have common<lb/> ownership but that operate in the same industry. A frequently observed variant is that unionised<lb/> employees (possibly from different industries) participate in the same multi-employer schemes. In<lb/> both cases, trade unions and industry associations play an important role in setting up and<lb/> administering the schemes. Representatives of both employees and employers sit on the board of<lb/> trustees and jointly make decisions about the running of the schemes, although they often hire<lb/> professional managers to conduct daily activities relating to the funds. In this context, equal<lb/> representation for employee and employer representatives is almost always observed, although<lb/> some plans are administered entirely by the unions. In addition, outsourcing activities are<lb/> common, in which investment, custody and other services, etc are outsourced and conducted by<lb/> external professional service providers.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.2 Introduction and evolution<lb/></head>

			<p>Industry funds are important players in the pension fund markets of OECD countries. For example,<lb/> in Australia as of September 2006 there were 82 industry funds and the total amount of assets<lb/> under management was AUS$ 162 billion (i.e. 17.2% of the whole superannuation market). In the<lb/> Netherlands, industry funds are a popular pension arrangement as well, with over 80% of the<lb/> work-force who participate in the occupational pensions market covered by such funds. As of<lb/> 2006, there were more than 70 industry-wide pension funds in the Netherlands. Industry-wide<lb/> pension plans also dominate the occupational pension scene in Denmark. In addition, industry<lb/> funds also exist in other economies although on a smaller scale in terms of participation, coverage<lb/> and pension fund assets. For example, in the US multi-employer pension schemes have been<lb/> popular in such industries where workers typically do not stay very long with the same employer,<lb/> e.g. light manufacturing industries (e.g. food and confectionery, printing and publishing, and<lb/> furniture), construction, transportation (trucking) and other non-manufacturing industries (e.g.<lb/> wholesale and retail trades). Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, China, two industry funds are currently in<lb/> operation; one is for the construction industry, and the other is for the catering industry, while in<lb/> Germany, industry funds were established in several industries, e.g. chemical and metalworking<lb/> industries.<lb/></p>

			<p>It has been argued that industry funds have their historical roots in the communication and<lb/> collective bargaining mechanism between trade unions and industry associations of employers,<lb/> which enable the establishment of industry funds on a collective basis. In Australia, industry funds<lb/> started to grow fast from the late 1980s onwards, and during this period, unions played an<lb/> important role.<lb/> In the Netherlands, the story is similar in that the formal negotiation mechanism between<lb/> employees and employers or their representatives has been in place for a long period of time. In<lb/> this context, employee unions and employer associations are frequently engaged in<lb/> communication and dialogue in addressing the issues in which both parties are interested,<lb/> (including pension arrangements). Like Australia, this arrangement in the Netherlands has to a<lb/> large extent facilitated the establishment of industry funds, especially given the collective<lb/> bargaining mechanisms already in place.<lb/> Membership of industry funds has been traditionally limited to specific industries. However, this<lb/> has changed over time. For example, in the Australian superannuation system, many industry<lb/> funds have started to open membership to workers in companies outside their industry, mainly for<lb/> the reasons of retaining existing members who leave the industry for which the fund caters,<lb/> expanding membership generally and achieving greater economies of scale. In the Netherlands,<lb/> however, the general rule regarding restricted membership still dominates.<lb/> In Switzerland, insurance companies offer ―collective foundations‖ for SMEs and other<lb/> enterprises that want to avoid the complications of establishing and maintaining their own pension<lb/> foundations. In this case, the ―collective foundation‖, established by insurance companies, is run<lb/> by professional directors typically appointed by the same insurance companies or their parent<lb/> companies, with no representation from employees and employers. This collective foundation<lb/> then purchases insurance from the parent insurance company and outsources other services to<lb/> professional institutions (e.g. asset investment) if deemed necessary.<lb/> Industry-wide pension plans also exist in other OECD countries, e.g. Canada and Germany,<lb/> countries where trade unions have been traditionally common. For example, in September 2001,<lb/> the Mining, Chemical and Energy Union (IG BCE) and the German Federation of Chemical<lb/> Employees&apos; Associations (BAVC) made an agreement to establish an industry-wide pension fund,<lb/> which is administered by a private bank but controlled by BAVC and IG BCE.<lb/> Furthermore, nationalisation of pension arrangements could go beyond the industry level. For<lb/> example, in Sweden most salaried employees are covered by the ITP scheme which is a nation-<lb/>wide scheme based on collective agreements between the Swedish Employer&apos; Confederation and<lb/> the trade unions for salaried employees within the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.3 Regulatory framework<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted earlier, industry funds are a product of collective bargaining between employees and<lb/> employers or their respective representatives. Against this background, the trustee board in<lb/> Australia and the United States (and the governing body of the foundation for the Netherlands)<lb/> typically has equal numbers of representatives from both sides. In this case, the employee<lb/> representatives should be appointed or elected by the plan members and beneficiaries or<lb/> organisations representing their interests, and they are not necessarily the members of the fund<lb/> (for example, they could be the professional individual trustees representing employees).<lb/> Employer representatives should be appointed or elected by the participating employers or the<lb/> employer association(s) involved in the collective bargaining. In Canada, multi-employer plans<lb/> are jointly administered by the union and the employers&apos; federation (at least 50% employee<lb/> representation), but they can be also run solely by the union itself.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the current pension regulation laws in Australia, employers must contribute to a fund on<lb/> behalf of their employees. Prior to 1 July 2005, the fund was usually mandated in an industry<lb/> award or agreement, however since that date employees are generally free to choose the fund into<lb/> which their compulsory contributions are paid. Although it is not compulsory in the Netherlands,<lb/> employers can send a request to the government asking permission to set up a mandatory industry<lb/> fund, if these employers represent the interests of 60% of the whole work-force in the industry.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to ensure appropriate representation of all members within the fund, the existing<lb/> regulation in Australia does not allow any unnecessary restriction which prohibits certain groups<lb/> of members from being nominated. However, it is acceptable to set a quota for member<lb/> representatives from specific geographical locations, in order to protect interests of those<lb/> members from under-represented or smaller regions. In this context, an interesting observation in<lb/> the Netherlands is that joint chairpersons exist, one representing employees, while the other<lb/> representing employers, with the two chairs rotating responsibility to chair the board on a yearly<lb/> basis. This rotation is important because in the event of a tied vote the chairperson has an<lb/> additional casting vote.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some OECD countries, an individual independent trustee may be appointed to the board of<lb/> trustee, partly to balance the interests of employee and employer representatives or to provide<lb/> additional expertise. Such an appointment may occur if the pension regulatory or supervisory<lb/> body holds the view that the board is not acting sufficiently to protect beneficiaries&apos; interests. In<lb/> some cases, the independent trustees may serve as the chairperson, and interestingly in Australia it<lb/> is stipulated that the independent trustee or independent director of the board possesses a<lb/> deliberative vote rather than casting vote -this restriction supporting the principle that employee<lb/> and employer representatives should be the ultimate decision makers of the industry funds.<lb/> Trustees of industry funds in Australia and the Netherlands (who are typically senior<lb/> managers/officials of the respective trade unions and industry associations) are normally<lb/> voluntary and traditionally unpaid. This is because, 1) they work on a part time basis, their time as<lb/> trustees effectively being limited by their main job, and 2) it is argued that the unpaid role of<lb/> trustees ensures the trustees work solely for the interests of beneficiaries, rather than any<lb/> commercial interest. However, it is becoming common for trustees of industry funds in Australia<lb/> to be remunerated, but only for the time they spend on fund-related issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given that many employee and employer representatives are not professionals in areas such as<lb/> investment or actuarial issues, an advisory board is sometimes established alongside the main<lb/> trustee board, such as is the case in the Netherlands. In this case, representation of employees and<lb/> employers is frequently required, although it is not necessarily on an equal basis.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the United States, collectively bargained retirement plans involving more than one employer<lb/> are required to have a joint board of trustees, half elected by the union and half by employers.<lb/> These plans are often defined benefit plans covering union members in a region and type of job<lb/> (such as trucking, mining, or broadly service related).<lb/> Some countries also require trustee to purchase indemnity insurance. In Australia, for example,<lb/> trustees must purchase appropriate insurance (offered by insurance companies) against any<lb/> liability to which they may be exposed when they conduct their fiduciary duties. However, cover<lb/> is not available in cases where losses are due to the trustee&apos;s dishonesty, deliberately failing to<lb/> exercise the required degree of care, or incurring a monetary penalty under a civil penalty order.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.4 Key merits and weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p>The biggest advantage relating to industry or multi-employer funds is that these are non-profit<lb/> bodies and therefore the potential problem of conflicts of interests between shareholders and<lb/> beneficiaries does not normally arise. The interests of beneficiaries are thought to be better<lb/> protected, largely due to the full involvement of employees and employers or their respective<lb/> representatives in running the funds. Another key merit relates to economies of scale, given that<lb/> most industry funds countries such as Australia and the Netherlands are large in comparison to<lb/> smaller individual company funds. Consequently, this should lead to lower transaction costs,<lb/> particularly in contrast to master trusts. In the same context, it is also easier for larger funds to<lb/> afford high quality service providers.<lb/> Meanwhile, another clear advantage of multi-employer funds is the ease of portability for the plan<lb/> members. When they move from one employer to another employer that is also participating in<lb/> the same multi-employer plan, their pension plan participation and pension accruals are<lb/> continuous. There is no need to terminate membership and then rejoin that plan or a new plan.<lb/> While equal representation has the benefit of allowing employees and employers greater control<lb/> over their pension funds, it also has drawbacks. Largely due to lack of expertise of trustees, their<lb/> decisions (especially those related to the investment of the pension fund assets) might not be<lb/> optimal. This issue is usually addressed by hiring external consultants or providing training to<lb/> trustees, with the additional costs involved hopefully offset by higher net returns.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Master trust<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to industry funds, another form of CPFs which is common in developed economies,<lb/> including OECD countries and Hong Kong, China, is the standardised master trust, which by<lb/> definition is open to all corporate plan sponsors. This arrangement is popular largely due to easy<lb/> joining and operation on the plan sponsor&apos;s part, and heavy promotion by the financial sector for<lb/> commercial reasons.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.1 Characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>The typical type of master trust is a standardised investment product offered by financial<lb/> institutions in the pensions market. In this case, any interested plan sponsor (which is not<lb/> necessarily to be in the same industry as the above-mentioned industry funds) can<lb/> establish/purchase such funds, subject to agreement on fees and investment strategies, etc.<lb/> Selection of service providers and/or the financial products are in general decided by employers<lb/> (rather than employees). In many cases, a range of investment products with different risk-return<lb/> profiles are available, which are then targeted at plan sponsors or groups of participants with<lb/> different risk preferences.<lb/> In comparison with industry funds, the trustees of master trusts are nearly always profit-oriented 4 ,<lb/> i.e. they operate for commercial reasons, providing professional services -although by law they<lb/> still have the fiduciary duty to act in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the pension<lb/> plan. In terms of organisation, master trusts often operate on a ―one-stop shopping‖ basis, where<lb/> different professional services, e.g. asset management and record keeping, are bundled vertically<lb/> and managed de facto by the same financial institution or group. In other words, the various<lb/> service providers are likely to be separate (legal) entities, but they are often part of a larger (parent)<lb/> financial institution.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.2 Introduction and evolution<lb/></head>

			<p>The development of master trusts has been closely linked to the overall development of financial<lb/> markets, particularly the fund management industry, given similarities in terms of investment<lb/> products, requirements for specific expertise etc. Not surprisingly, some OECD countries, e.g.<lb/> Australia and the United States, are home not only to a developed retail pension fund industry, but<lb/> also to mature financial markets in general.<lb/> As of September 2006, the total assets within the superannuation (pension) system in Australia<lb/> were AUS$ 946 billion. Among the different types of schemes, however, master trusts represent<lb/> the largest share, i.e. 32.4% with assets at AUS$ 306 billion in 2006. Hong Kong, China also has<lb/> a developed master trust industry, as master trust schemes remain the most popular form of<lb/> pension arrangement. For example, as of March 2007, out of 40 existing pension schemes in Hong<lb/> Kong, China, 36 were master trust schemes, while two were industry schemes, and another two<lb/> were employer-sponsored schemes.<lb/> In addition to the trust-based CPFs, other forms exist in some OECD countries. For example, in<lb/> Portugal, pension funds are not operated as a trust, but as independent organisations without legal<lb/> personality. In this case, they are managed by professional pension fund management companies<lb/> (limited liability companies created solely for the business of managing pension funds).<lb/> In terms of providing pension services, it can be argued that financial institutions react quickly in<lb/> order to better respond to market demands. For example, in the United States, traditional<lb/> occupational pension schemes have also been difficult for SMEs to set up or join, given regulatory<lb/> complexity and high costs. Consequently, the financial markets as well as the pension regulatory<lb/> authorities have worked together and designed a range of collective products which are available<lb/> for SMEs on an affordable and effective basis. Clear examples include the simplified employee<lb/> pension plans (SEPs) and SIMPLE IRA plan, among others, in the United States.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.3 Regulatory framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Trustees of master trusts are subject to stricter regulations than those in the industry funds, mainly<lb/> given the concerns which arise from the fact that they are operated on a commercial basis.<lb/> Regarding capital requirements, for example, in Hong Kong, China, the MPF legislation stipulates<lb/> that a trustee company should have a paid-up share capital and net assets of at least HK$ 150<lb/> million, while in Australia, there is a similar requirement on the licensed retail trustee, consisting<lb/> of AUS$ 5 million (also applicable to industry funds which open their membership). The main<lb/> purposes of having a prescribed capital requirement include to provide some financial resources to<lb/> act as a buffer against any potential risks and to ensure the financial soundness of the trustees<lb/> among others. In addition, in Hong Kong, China 0.03% of assets are deducted from the scheme<lb/> assets (in the form of compensation fund levy) as an extra layer of protection on the interests of<lb/> beneficiaries (e.g. covering losses due to misfeasance and illegal conduct committed by MPF<lb/> trustees).<lb/></p>

			<p>Where master trusts operate under a trust system, representation of employees and employers<lb/> (equal or otherwise) on the board of trustees is generally not required. Normally, directors of the<lb/> board of trustees are appointed by the financial institutions who offer the retail pension fund, and<lb/> they often have professional experience and expertise in running pension funds. Meanwhile, they<lb/> may be paid as the general directors if they work on a full-time basis.<lb/> Pension fund regulatory and supervisory authorities use various methods to try and ensure that<lb/> commercial trustees fulfil their fiduciary duties properly. For example, in Hong Kong, China, the<lb/> trustee board should have at least one independent director who in turn needs to meet certain<lb/> criteria (e.g. not be a director of an associate of the trust company, not hold any share of the trust<lb/> company, etc). There is no specific requirement in Australia although trustees must meet fitness<lb/> and propriety standards. However, the Australian legislation prescribes that the commercial trust<lb/> company should set up at least one policy committee with representatives of employers and<lb/> employees. In this case, the policy committee mainly serves in the same way as an advisory board<lb/> and does not have voting power.<lb/> In addition to requirements for independent directors and oversight bodies, such as policy<lb/> committees, trustees in Hong Kong, China and Australia should have adequate insurance to cover<lb/> the potential losses due to the maladministration of the scheme by the trustees. Such indemnity<lb/> insurance (offered by insurance companies) should cover a specified amount/percentage of the<lb/> total assets under management in Hong Kong, China.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given that financial markets are risky, one way in which regulatory authorities, (such as those<lb/> overseeing the mandatory pension fund system in Hong Kong, China), offer some protection to<lb/> members of retail pension funds is to require that one investment option offered to members has<lb/> to be a capital preservation fund which typically invests in low risk money market products.<lb/> Master trusts in many other countries are not subject to equivalent regulations as in Hong Kong,<lb/> China, and they simply follow the principle of prudential investment to reduce and diversify risks.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.4 Key merits and weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p>The major merit of master trusts is that all pension-related services are provided by financial<lb/> institutions, as plan sponsors need only ―shop‖ around the market, choose a suitable pension fund<lb/> provider and remit contributions to the provider once they have made their choice. This is<lb/> particularly relevant for unrelated SMEs, given the difficulty, if forced to jointly choose a<lb/> provider, of reaching a consensus among diverse SMEs members which differ in terms of size,<lb/> business scope, industry etc. Another advantage relates to the quality of service and professional<lb/> expertise provided by financial institutions, given their experience in administering and running<lb/> pension funds.<lb/> However, poor representation of employees and employers on the trustee board is one of the main<lb/> weaknesses for master trusts, and the question as to how to align trustees&apos; commercial interests<lb/> and their fiduciary duties is difficult to answer. Concerns relate both to actual/potential conflicts-<lb/>of-interest and general loss of control by the plan sponsors (employers). A related point is whether<lb/> the high fees charged by master trusts in comparison to industry funds are justified by better fee-<lb/>adjusted returns in the long run. The advantages of one-stop shopping are clear, but a directly<lb/> related concern is that the services are ―bundled‖ and thus the pricing structures are rarely<lb/> transparent. This bundling and limited flexibility can become aggravated when the employer<lb/> grows from being an SME (in need of such retail-type products) to a large employer that could<lb/> otherwise stand alone and operate a single employer fund (with all its flexibility and control and<lb/> clear differentiation of functions).<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Review of the EA and CPFs in China<lb/> 3.1 A brief review on China&apos;s EA and CPFs<lb/> 3.1.1 EA markets in China<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<figure>concept of occupational pensions (referred to as Enterprise Annuities – EA -in China) was<lb/> first introduced to the Chinese pension system in late 1990 when the Chinese authorities started to<lb/> implement the multi-pillar model recommended by the World Bank. After over 10 years of<lb/> development, many enterprises across the country have established complementary pension plans<lb/> on a voluntary basis. Most of these funds were set up before the Enterprise Annuity legislation of<lb/> 2004 was passed. Such funds are generally known as ―legacy EAs‖. Some, new EAs have also<lb/> been established under the new 2004 legislation. Currently, the ―legacy EA‖ market in China<lb/> comprises four players, namely:<lb/> a) The EA Administration Centres, which were purposely established to administer and manage<lb/> pension funds accumulated in a particular region. The most notable two are the Shanghai EA<lb/> Administration Centre and Shenzhen Administration Centre. These EA Administration Centres,<lb/> are de facto part of the local social security bureaus. As of 2006, the Shanghai EA Administration<lb/> Centre accumulated over RMB 10 billion of pension assets, while it was RMB 2.3 billion for the<lb/> Shenzhen Administration Centre.<lb/></figure>

			<p>b) In many other regions, such EA assets were simply handed over to the local social security<lb/> bureaus which then deposited these assets in banks and/or bought government bonds (note in this<lb/> case, there is no establishment and involvement of the EA Administration Centres). The total<lb/> amount of assets under control of the local social security bureaus (both (a) and</p>

			<p>(b)) was estimated<lb/> to be around RMB 15 billion as of 2005.<lb/></p>

			<p>c) Industry funds (e.g. power and electricity) were established voluntarily and managed internally<lb/> by the respective industries themselves. Similar to a), the relevant industries normally established<lb/> their own EA administration centre or department, and such funds are consequently managed<lb/> centrally within the industry. As of 2004, EA funds within this category were estimated to be<lb/> RMB 35 billion 5 , among which the State Electricity EA Centre controlled more than RMB 10<lb/> billion of assets.<lb/></p>

			<p>d) In order to provide pension products for their employees, many other profitable &quot;stand-alone&quot;<lb/> companies, directly bought insurance products from insurance companies. In this regard,<lb/> contributions from employers used to buy insurance products are not viewed as EA funds<lb/> according to the current legislation and are therefore not entitled to the tax relief benefit. As of<lb/> 2005, it was estimated that around RMB 43 billion assets were accumulated under this category.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In total, the EA schemes – currently primarily established by profitable enterprises/industries in<lb/> China – have accumulated RMB 91 billion assets 6 as of 2006 (75 billion of which are ‗legacy<lb/> funds&apos; held by EAs established before the 2004 pension legislation). Based on estimates by<lb/> Stirling Finance, Hong Kong, China 7 , the overall (legacy and new) EA assets in China could grow<lb/> to the level of RMB 700bn by 2015, although more optimistic estimates see RMB 700bn five<lb/> years earlier, i.e. by 2010, as indicated in the same report.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Although the EA market has witnessed sizable growth in the past, this market was less regulated,<lb/> given the fact that its driving force was largely from profitable, large enterprises and the private<lb/> sector. The main legislative efforts of the Chinese authorities had been focused on the<lb/> establishment and strengthening of the social security system 8 , as seen from the release of a<lb/> number of major regulations on these issues and heavy fiscal transfer from the central government<lb/> to the local governments to help fund social security schemes. Recently, however, the Chinese<lb/> authorities have again begun to focus on the concept of occupational pensions and have started to<lb/> promote their development in a more systematic matter. In this regard, a number of reform<lb/> initiatives and regulations have been directly linked to the EA plan, for example, the Decree No.<lb/></p>

			<head>20 Interim Measure for Enterprise Annuities Schemes, and Decree No. 23 Interim Measures for<lb/> Management of Enterprise Annuities Fund</head>

			<figure>(hereinafter Decrees 20 and 23) were issued by the<lb/> Ministry of Labour and Social Security in 2004.<lb/> 5 SINA (2005). http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/y/20050330/14281473729.shtml; accessed on 20 February 2007.<lb/> 6 http://www.cnpension.net/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=21819; accessed on 4 April 2007.<lb/> 7 CLSA (2006). ―Moving on up: pension funds in Asian markets‖; Hong Kong.<lb/> 8 The mandatory public pension part of the multi-pillar model in China comprises two components, i.e. pillar 1A and<lb/> pillar 1B. Pillar 1A provides defined benefits and operates on a PAYG basis, with contributions at 20% of payroll and<lb/> wholly from enterprises; the target replacement rate is 35% of the final-year salary. Pillar 1B should in theory be fully<lb/> funded with sole contributions of 8% of salaries from employees; the target replacement rate is 24.2%.<lb/></figure>

			<p>According to these two regulations, new EA funds in China should be managed based on the<lb/> trustee model, which can be either an external trustee (professional corporate entity) or an internal<lb/> trustee (pension council). Existing corporate pension plans – i.e. ‗legacy EAs&apos; -are still allowed to<lb/> exits, though they are not subject to favourable tax treatment. Furthermore, it has been noted that<lb/> these legacy funds will have to comply with the new EA legislation in the future. However, it is<lb/> apparent that the concept of trust law is neither really understood nor implemented appropriately<lb/> in China. For example, under the external trustee model, in practice employers (rather than<lb/> trustees) directly select and appoint EA service providers (e.g. asset managers and custodians).<lb/> Under the internal trustee model, it is also usually the employer who plays a critical role in the<lb/> selection process of service providers, as the internal trustee board in most cases is de facto<lb/> controlled by the plan sponsor.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Concerning the new EA funds (i.e. those based on Decrees 20 and 23), statistics show that as of<lb/> June 2006, 263 enterprises (mostly large profitable companies) in China had established such<lb/> (single company) occupational pension plans. The corresponding number of participants was<lb/> 940,000 and total assets amounted to RMB 11bn. It is noted that before 2004, a large amount of<lb/> EA assets were managed by the local EA Administration Centres (part of the labour bureaus, and<lb/> whose main responsibility is to manage assets in pillars 1A and 1B). However, due to pension<lb/> investment scandals across the country (particularly that in Shanghai in 2006), the Chinese central<lb/> government has recently shown their willingness to transfer all those EA funds (i.e. currently<lb/> managed by the local social security bureaus) to the private sector by 2007. In this context, on 26<lb/> April 2007, one guideline from MOLSS was released, detailing how such legacy funds should be<lb/> transferred. The key message is that all assets (i.e. from a to d above) should be handed over to the<lb/> qualified institutions which implicitly refer to licensed financial institutions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Of all new EAs, one noticeable case is the recent establishment of a nation wide pension fund by<lb/> the Lenovo group, the world&apos;s 3 rd largest personal computer marker. By outsourcing all services -<lb/>i.e. trusteeship, administration, asset management and custody -to professional institutions,<lb/> Lenovo&apos;s occupational plan started in July 2006 and became the first plan to be registered with the<lb/> MOLSS office in Beijing 9 . The initial outlay was RMB 50m (US$ 6.3m) which will rise by RMB<lb/> 20m in a year&apos;s time. In recent years, pension funds have also been established by many other<lb/> company groups, although compared to the traditional industry funds discussed in the preceding<lb/> section, they are small in terms of both membership and asset managed. However, they have the<lb/> advantage of operating according to the new pension legislation.<lb/> A pending policy question is whether pension insurance contracts will be recognised under EA<lb/> legislation and offered similar tax relief as pension funds. Life insurance companies in China have<lb/> traditionally played an important role in China&apos;s occupational pension system. Their existence and<lb/> rapid growth reflects the specific conditions during the period (starting from 1990s) when the<lb/> central government allowed the development of occupational pensions by releasing general<lb/> guidelines while leaving the details of implementation to the discretion of individual companies,<lb/> industries, etc. Against this background, life insurance companies stepped in and secured a large<lb/> share of the pensions market, given their expertise and experience in managing contractual<lb/> savings and their wide networks across the country. However, based on the new laws, the assets<lb/> currently managed by the insurance companies are not viewed as EA assets and therefore are not<lb/> entitled to tax benefits 10 . Currently, the insurance regulator in China (i.e. China Insurance<lb/> Regulatory Commission CIRC) has requested the central government to reconsider its existing<lb/> laws, and to treat the assets under control of the insurance companies as legitimate EA assets.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.2 CPFs in China<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted above, certain collective pension arrangements already exist in China.</p>

			<figure>For example the<lb/> local EA Administration Centres in different localities in China effectively operate collective<lb/> pension funds. The existing industry funds managing legacy EAs are the other main form of CPFs<lb/> in the country.<lb/> a) CPFs through local social security EA Administration Centres<lb/> The Administration Centres in Shanghai and Shenzhen were the largest such arrangements in<lb/> China. Beside these, similar centres have also been created in other parts of the country, e.g. in<lb/> Liaoning Province. Participating firms whose EA assets are managed by these local government<lb/> centres are not necessarily linked by common ownership, or in the same industry. However, the<lb/> majority of these participating firms are indeed profitable enterprises. The establishment of such<lb/> centres is a typical example of intervention of the Chinese authorities to facilitate the development<lb/> of chosen industries. However, based on the central government&apos;s plan to externalise the EA<lb/> assets currently under control by local governments, the EA Administration Centres in China have<lb/> been in the process of transformation. In principle, different options have been identified as<lb/> possible solutions:<lb/> a1) The EA Admin Centres terminate administering and managing EA assets by a date specified<lb/> by the central government, and all assets currently under management are returned back to the<lb/> participating firms; then the firms themselves choose licensed trustees and other qualified service<lb/> providers;<lb/> a2) Similar to the above, but the participating firms set up their own internal trustee boards, which<lb/> then select qualified service providers;<lb/> a3) All businesses of the EA Admin Centres are transferred to one or more licensed trustees;<lb/> a4) The local EA Admin Centres are restructured from being de facto local governmental agencies<lb/> to independent commercial trustees (i.e. collective pension trustees in a particular region).<lb/> It is noted that recently (i.e. January 2007) the Shenzhen Admin Centre adopted the a3) approach.<lb/> In this regard, all the EA assets were transferred to China Merchants Bank (as custodian and<lb/> account administrator), and Pingan Life (as trustee and asset manager). The transfer involved 250<lb/> participating firms with assets at RMB 2.3 billion. Although participating firms are allowed to<lb/></figure>

			<p>change their own service providers, it is expected that majority of them will not do so as there is<lb/> currently little differentiation between such service providers in China (and the transfer agreement<lb/> specifies that they should choose the new service providers within three months of transfer).<lb/> Meanwhile, regarding the Shanghai Admin Centre, the option a4) has been adopted. Specifically,<lb/> a new insurance company named as ―Yangtze River Pension Trust‖ has been recently established<lb/> in Shanghai and also received a license from CIRC. Some sources note that the newly established<lb/> company (which is currently in the process of applying for license from the MOLSS) will be<lb/> responsible for administrating and managing the legacy pension assets, while for the new EA<lb/> assets, any qualified service provider could compete on a free-market basis.<lb/></p>

			<head>b) CPFs covering profitable industries<lb/></head>

			<p>Currently EA plans have been established in 11 key industries in China, e.g. electricity, railway,<lb/> and petroleum 11 . It is reported the assets are normally used to buy government bonds and invest in<lb/> key state projects (e.g. Three Gorges Project), as well as group insurance products. In this regard,<lb/> for some industries, e.g. electricity, the EA Admin Centre (de facto trustee) was established to<lb/> administer the assets, while for others, the assets were simply managed by the finance<lb/> departments at the headquarters in Beijing or regional headquarters across the country. In some<lb/> cases, such finance departments are independent finance companies. It is thought that the assets of<lb/> these existing industry funds are not managed in line with the Decrees 20 and No 23 regulations<lb/> (i.e. the new EA legislation). However, it remains unclear how to transform such assets into the<lb/> new EA regime, although some reform initiatives have been under discussion, and it is reported<lb/> that such industries prefer to restructure their existing fund administration mechanism (e.g. by<lb/> setting up internal trustee boards) in order to maintain control of the EA money.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.3 &quot; One-stop shopping &quot; arrangements<lb/></head>

			<p>―One-stop shopping‖ involves the vertical integration of various functions related to the operation<lb/> of the pension fund within a single entity, which is common for CPFs in many OECD countries.<lb/> Setting aside consulting, auditing and other clearly external services, Chinese legislation has<lb/> already identified the four fundamental layers in the creation and operation of a pension fund,<lb/> namely:<lb/> a. Trust management, through either a pension council or a corporate trustee entity.<lb/> b. Investment management.<lb/> c. Record-keeping.<lb/> d. Custodian.<lb/> The idea of vertical integration is to employ a single entity (normally the trustee or equivalent) to<lb/> perform two or more of these functions. One-stop shopping is a useful arrangement in that it<lb/> provides a range of different and professional services within one group, which implies simplicity<lb/> and less complications for plan sponsors. Based on Decrees 20 and 23, vertical integration is<lb/> permitted, although custody service may not be undertaken by the same company that serves as<lb/> the asset manager.<lb/> In this context, it is observed that financial institutions in China are working together to introduce<lb/> products attractive to SMEs. In early 2007, Pingan Insurance agreed with China Merchants Bank<lb/> to provide the ―2-2‖ arrangement mainly targeting SMEs in Jiangsu province, one of the richest<lb/> provinces in China and where a large number of SMEs operate. According to this initiative,<lb/> Pingan Insurance serves as the trustee and asset manager, while China Merchants Bank serves as<lb/> the administrator and custodian. Due to the short history, it is not clear for the time being how<lb/> successful this arrangement is, but it is a good start in terms of promoting CPFs in China (it<lb/> should be noted that these two institutions received the fund transfer from the Shengzhen EA<lb/> Administration Centre in January 2007, as discussed in Section 3.1.2a).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Problems holding back development of CPFs in China<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite their importance in China&apos;s economic fabric, SMEs have been left behind by recent EA<lb/> reforms. For example, as of February 2006, statistics (Annuity 2007 12 ) show that SMEs accounted<lb/> for 55% of the overall GDP, 60% of exports, and 75% of total employment, while only 50 SMEs<lb/> (out of 23 million SMEs in China) reported and registered their (new) EA plans with the local<lb/> social security bureaus, and the corresponding EA assets were just 1% of the total EA asset<lb/> accumulation.<lb/> What are the main obstacles holding back development of CPFs in China, particularly among<lb/> SMEs? The key problems will now be discussed.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1 Structural obstacle<lb/></head>

			<p>Based on Decree 20, the establishment of EA plans requires sponsoring firms to meet 3 criteria,<lb/> i.e. having participated and paid social security contributions, being financially sound, and having<lb/> a collective bargaining mechanism in place. However, the reality in China is that many SMEs try<lb/> to avoid participating in and contributing to social security. Meanwhile, many SMEs do not have<lb/> sound collective bargaining and internal redress mechanisms. For example, trade unions and<lb/> regular meetings with representatives from both employees and employer are not common within<lb/> SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2 Limited tax relief<lb/></head>

			<p>Profit margins are much lower for SMEs than for state-controlled industries (e.g. electricity,<lb/> railways etc.). Therefore the extra contributions required for EA plans on top of the compulsory<lb/> pension contributions are a major negative disincentive to their provision by SMEs. This is<lb/> particularly the case when employer contributions are only tax deductible up to a limit of 4% of<lb/> payroll, while employee contributions (if any) are not tax deductible at all. Therefore, unless other<lb/> ways are introduced to reduce the overall costs created by EA contributions (e.g. more tax<lb/> benefits), SMEs will naturally avoid participating.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3 High administrative costs<lb/></head>

			<p>Since 2004, the EA market in China entered a new era, following the release of the two Decrees<lb/> with details regarding the procedures for setting up EA plans, capital requirements for the external<lb/> EA service providers, investment limits, etc. On the one hand, the EA markets in China are<lb/> becoming more regulated and developed; on the other hand, it reinforces the difficulty in<lb/> establishing EA plans for small firms, given the potential high costs and lengthy procedure. Two<lb/> particularly challenging barriers are the following:<lb/> a) Lack of qualified staff<lb/> Establishing EA plans requires staff who at least understand what EA plans are, and who have<lb/> some basic knowledge of investment and finance related matters. Yet small firms tend to lack<lb/> such suitably qualified staff. Hiring more qualified staff will obviously incur extra costs for the<lb/> SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>b) High management fee<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the small size of EA assets accumulated within an individual SME, it is likely to be<lb/> inefficient to operate single company funds relative to industry funds. Therefore, either the fees<lb/> charged by service providers will be prohibitively high, or service providers may not seek EA<lb/> business from SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.4 Less awareness of EAs among SMEs<lb/></head>

			<p>Another obstacle to the establishment of EA plans among SMEs is that many SMEs do not know<lb/> and understand what an EA is. This is mainly due to less communication on EA plans being<lb/> directed to SMEs, itself partly a result of seduced interest among SMEs for the above reasons.<lb/> Wider investor education will be necessary.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.5 Weak collaboration between ministries<lb/></head>

			<p>Weak collaboration between different administrative regulatory and supervisory authorities has<lb/> also been a hurdle to developing the CPF market in <ref type="biblio">China.<lb/></ref> As noted in Section 3.1, industry funds exist in China and are one of the key players in the market.<lb/> However, how to transfer or transform such legacy funds into the new EA regime is difficult, as<lb/> several ministries in China play a role in the administration and supervision of these funds.<lb/> The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) is the main<lb/> administrator of the largest state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on behalf of the central government.<lb/> Meanwhile, it is widely recognised that current tax relief benefits on EA contributions have<lb/> discouraged sponsors from participating, but the power of setting tax policies belongs to the State<lb/> Taxation Administration (STA) in China. In addition, the Ministry of Finance may have a say in<lb/> this context, since the question as to whether to exempt some tax collections (e.g. tax on<lb/> investment income) is within this Ministry&apos;s jurisdiction.<lb/> Meanwhile, whenever the development and design of new financial products as well as<lb/> establishment of specialist financial institutions is involved, it is necessary to obtain permission<lb/> from three separate and independent financial regulators in China, i.e. China Banking Regulatory<lb/> Commission (CBRC), China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), and China Securities<lb/> Regulatory Commission (CSRC), as well as People&apos;s Bank of China. For example, trust products<lb/> offered by trust companies in China are regulated by CBRC, while CSRC oversees the mutual<lb/> fund markets. In addition, any insurance company wanting to set up specialist subsidiaries for the<lb/> purpose of conducting EA business (i.e. consistent with rules in Decrees 20 and 23) must obtain<lb/> permission from CIRC.<lb/> Overall, the current regulatory regime in China has been hindering the development of EA<lb/> markets in general and CPFs in particular. Therefore, a more collaborative supervisory<lb/> environment is needed to promote its development.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. How to establish CPFs in China<lb/></head>

			<p>Above, we discussed the problems holding back the development of CPFs in China. Given these<lb/> issues, and whilst bearing in mind the specific conditions in China as well as the experience of<lb/> selected OECD countries and Hong Kong, China, we propose the following practical policy<lb/> recommendations regarding how to promote the growth and development of CPFs in China. In<lb/> general, given the complexity of the current situations in China, reforms should combine the<lb/> efficient use of existing collective pension arrangements with new initiatives for wider<lb/> participation of the private sector, which in turn is discussed according to the two permitted<lb/> models (internal pension council and external corporate trustee).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Internal model (Pension Council)<lb/></head>

			<p>As reviewed in Section 3, CPFs have existed in China for some time. In view of developing CPFs<lb/> further, particularly among the SMEs with different business activities and locations. it is<lb/> recommended that the current existing mechanisms should be fully explored and used. To this end,<lb/> for example, the industry funds and local EA administration centres could be considered to be<lb/> potential channels through which employees in SMEs join EA schemes. The largest benefit of<lb/> using such existing mechanisms is the ease of establishment and the subsequent lower costs than<lb/> would be normally be incured when setting up a completely new mechanism. In this context,<lb/> MOLSS might consider utilizing existing industry funds and local EA administration centres -<lb/>subject to these providers meeting the requirements of the new EA legislation. It should be noted<lb/> that as the largest SOEs (covering almost all of the monopolistic industries, e.g. electricity and<lb/> mining in China) are under supervision of the SASAC, cooperation between MOLSS and SASAC<lb/> would be necessary.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.1 Existing industry funds<lb/></head>

			<p>One approach to establish CPFs in China for the SME sector would be to allow EA-compliant<lb/> existing industry funds to open their membership to non-related plan sponsors. All SMEs<lb/> regardless of industry affiliation could be entitled to join. As reviewed above, the Australian<lb/> superannuation industry recently witnessed such a trend as industry funds begin to become open<lb/> to non-related companies (including SMEs). SMEs that do not want to set up their own company<lb/> pension schemes can benefit from economies of scale offered by the industry funds, thus saving<lb/> costs.<lb/> The Chinese authorities have been engaged in reforms relating to the major national industry<lb/> funds in China, aiming to restructure these funds so that they meet the requirements stipulated in<lb/> Decree 20 (2004). Therefore, since efforts (from both government and industry) have already<lb/> been spent on these CPF arrangements, it may make sense to take an extra step and broaden these<lb/> funds&apos; membership. For example, MOLSS might consider allowing (or even encouraging) an<lb/> existing industry fund in China (e.g. the Electricity Industry Fund) to accept employees from other<lb/> industries (including SMEs). This might be one of the fastest ways to include employees in SMEs<lb/> in the formal EA system. Regarding the governance structure, initially it would be appropriate for<lb/> the existing governance structure to remain in place (e.g. representatives from the electricity<lb/> industry dominate the board), while in the future, if and when the industry fund has undergone<lb/> significant changes, notably regarding membership, the governance structure should reflect such<lb/> changes correspondingly, for example, having a more balanced representation with members or<lb/> representatives of other industries also having a place on the trustee board or advisory body, or<lb/> introducing some mechanism to ensure their voice is heard (for example at an annual meeting).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.2 New industry funds<lb/></head>

			<p>Another, somewhat slower way to promote the CPFs is by setting up new industry funds, rather<lb/> than using the above-mentioned existing industry funds. This approach might be appealing to the<lb/> industries concerned, given the fact that they are expected to be fully involved in establishment of<lb/> the funds, therefore having more control over them. Nevertheless, the establishment of new<lb/> industry funds should again rely on the existing collective bargaining mechanisms, for example<lb/> via industry associations. It is observed that such associations operate widely across the country,<lb/> although some are structured loosely, while others are more organised. International experience<lb/> shows that successfully using such associations to establish collective pension schemes is possible,<lb/> e.g. Australia and the Netherlands where industry associations played an important role in setting<lb/> up industry funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>In view of the current central government&apos;s priority on welfare of rural migrant workers (which<lb/> refers to a population amounting to approximately 200 million and with an average age in their<lb/> 20s), MOLSS might consider designing a pilot scheme in the areas where such rural migrant<lb/> workers are concentrated, e.g. Guangdong and Zhejiang. On the one hand, this initiative meets the<lb/> agenda of the central government, and therefore might be able to receive support (both financially<lb/> and politically); on the other hand, it helps MOLSS in building experience for similar situations<lb/> elsewhere in the country. Indeed in Hong Kong, China and in other countries such as the United<lb/> States, industry funds have been a popular choice for these mobile workers, for example those<lb/> working in the construction and catering industries.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.3 Regional administration centres<lb/></head>

			<p>It was noted above that the Chinese authorities have decided that the regional social security<lb/> bureaus should give up management of EA funds and transfer such funds to market participants<lb/> by the end of 2007. Given this decision it is a good time for the Chinese authorities to link such<lb/> policy initiatives with the goal of promoting CPFs in China. Our recommendation is that the<lb/> Chinese government might consider reconstructing the local EA administration centres initially to<lb/> be qualified EA trustees (i.e. collective pension councils), and then opening participation to SMEs<lb/> in the specific localities. For the regions where such local administration centres are not available,<lb/> MOLSS might consider encouraging their establishment. Such an arrangement may be appealing<lb/> to the three key participants of the CPF arrangements, i.e. employees/employers, the local<lb/> government and the MOLSS.<lb/> From the point of view of SMEs, they would have incentives to join such re-structured local EA<lb/> administration centres, given their logistical closeness to such centres and the administration<lb/> centres&apos; local orientation, which is particularly important at the early stage of their development.<lb/> From the point of view of the local governments, they might be also interested in such initiatives,<lb/> as they would maintain some control over these local pension assets, given the proposed<lb/> governance structure of the new local EA administration centres, as discussed below, in<lb/> comparison to the corporate trustee model (see the next section for details).<lb/> From the point of view of the MOLSS, the establishment of local administration centres as<lb/> qualified trustees might facilitate supervision, as these activities would already come under the<lb/> purview of social security bureaus.<lb/></p>

			<head>a) Governance structure of the proposed regional EA administration centres<lb/></head>

			<p>It is proposed that the re-structured local EA administration centres should serve as the trustees,<lb/> who have the ultimate responsibility of administrating and managing the EA assets, although if<lb/> deemed necessary, they can outsource other functions to the external professional service<lb/> providers, e.g. the EA asset management function could and probably should be outsourced to<lb/> professional asset managers. The trustees of the regional EA administration centres could be<lb/> structured along the internal, pension fund council model, or as an external trustee (as what<lb/> Shanghai EA Administration Centre mentioned earlier). In this section, we focus on the former,<lb/> since the latter will be discussed in detail in Section 4.2.<lb/> This governance structure would have to be handled carefully in order to avoid the problems with<lb/> the trustee models identified previously.<lb/> First, employee and employer representation on the pension council would need to be established.<lb/> Although equal representation is normal in OECD countries, there are no immediate and<lb/> compelling arguments to change the current Chinese EA legislation where it is stipulated that at<lb/> least 1/3 of the trustees should be from employee representatives. Given the diversity of<lb/> participating firms in the context of CPFs, it is recommended that existing collective bargaining<lb/> mechanisms should be used. For example, given the wide existence of the local trade unions at<lb/> different levels (i.e. municipal, provincial) in China, it is advisable that members from the trade<lb/> unions sit on the regional EA administration centre board of trustee, given their experience of<lb/> speaking on behalf of local employees. Regarding employer representatives, they should come<lb/> from the existing industry associations and/or the largest participants in terms of size and asset.<lb/> Note that from a practical perspective, it might not be optimal (or even possible) for every single<lb/> participating firm to have its direct representatives sitting on the board. Therefore the priority<lb/> could be given to the largest plan sponsors, although smaller plan sponsors could still have their<lb/> more direct ―voice‖, if the industry association of those smaller sponsors is available in the<lb/> specific localities. Alternatively, it is also recommended that key issues relating to the funds could<lb/> be voted at the annual general meeting (AGM), in which case members regardless of size are<lb/> given the opportunity to raise their concerns and take part in the decision making process.<lb/> Second, in order to ensure the smooth running of the local pension funds, inappropriate state<lb/> intervention should be avoided. However, there might be the possibility of government<lb/> representatives sitting on the board, as a way of overseeing the funds as well as with the aim of<lb/> receiving support from the local governments on this initiative. In this context, government<lb/> representatives could act as the standard independent trustee who does not have the casting vote.<lb/> Except for the government representatives (if any), employees and employer representatives<lb/> should be nominated via the appropriate mechanisms (e.g. AGM), rather than being appointed by<lb/> the largest employers and industry associations, as a way to ensure that the voice of the smaller<lb/> employers is heard.<lb/></p>

			<head>b) Risk control<lb/></head>

			<p>The proposed pension council model for EA administration centres seems an appropriate choice<lb/> for SMEs, since it may be able to protect better the interests of beneficiaries. However, one<lb/> question is whether capital requirements are necessary for pension councils, as for external,<lb/> commercial trustees? One reason for not setting such minimum capital requirements is that<lb/> pension councils are not financial and/or commercial organisations, and are instead operated on a<lb/> ―not-for-profit‖ basis. Therefore, they might not be able to afford the financial requirements if<lb/> such capital requirements are set to be as high as those imposed on the financial institutions.<lb/> However, in order to control risks, and subject to availability, commercial insurance might be<lb/> utilised as in the case in Hong Kong, China and Australia. In other words, trustees buy indemnity<lb/> insurance from insurance providers to cover any potential loss which might arise. However, as in<lb/> other countries, if such loss is due to dishonesty and deliberate misconduct, trustees should not be<lb/> covered by the insurance policy, but subject to legal charges, since they did not fulfil their<lb/> fiduciary duties.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 External model (Corporate Trustee)<lb/></head>

			<p>As reviewed in the earlier case studies, the private sector plays a very important role in CPF<lb/> arrangements in most OECD countries. When promoting and developing CPFs in China, full<lb/> consideration should be given to participation by the private sector, in light of their experience in<lb/> managing EA assets. As stipulated in Decree No. 23 regulation in 2004, a professional trustee<lb/> refers to a professional financial institution which is licensed by MOLSS to conduct the<lb/> trusteeship business – therefore giving the private sector a role in the EA market.<lb/> At the moment, it is understood that the private sector (e.g. insurance companies and asset<lb/> managers) is interested in developing the SMEs aspect of the pension fund market in China,<lb/> although it still sees many obstacles which have delayed the take-off and development of the<lb/> CPFs. The key feature of the professional trustee model is that financial institutions serve as the<lb/> trustees which are operated on a ―for-profit‖ basis. In this case, trustees can outsource the<lb/> professional functions to other service providers, but the ultimate responsibility and fiduciary<lb/> duties cannot be outsourced. This arrangement has been popular in some OECD countries as well<lb/> as Hong Kong, China.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.1 &quot; One-stop shopping &quot; arrangement<lb/></head>

			<p>―One-stop shopping‖ involves the vertical integration of various functions related to the operation<lb/> of the pension fund within a single entity, and is permitted under the current Chinese legislation,<lb/> except for the case of custodian services which cannot be conducted by the asset manager. One-<lb/>stop shopping is a useful arrangement in that it provides a range of different and professional<lb/> services within one group, which implies simplicity and less complications for plan sponsors.<lb/></p>

			<p>In several other countries throughout the world, it is common for the main three pension related<lb/> services (i.e. administration, asset management and trusteeship) to be performed by a single entity,<lb/> especially for SMEs. There are the obvious potential advantages of cost reductions and avoidance<lb/> of overlaps and vacuums in the allocation of activities between separate parties. Vertical<lb/> integration of functions for a single pension plan within a single pension entity can also help<lb/> resolve certain issues about individual and ultimate responsibilities. On the other hand, it may<lb/> increase the possibilities for abuse – resulting from so many powers (including discretionary<lb/> powers) being allocated to a single body without, possibly adequate checks and balances.<lb/> Nevertheless, it is recommended that such arrangements should continue to be allowed in the<lb/> context of CPF legislation – on the basis that the advantages of such arrangements are greater than<lb/> the disadvantages, as long as the private sector is subject to efficient and effective supervision.<lb/> Indeed, in OECD countries, such ―one-stop shopping‖ is common, and has served as one of the<lb/> main mechanisms through which employees in SMEs can access occupational pensions on a cost-<lb/>efficient basis (for example via SEPs in the United States). In Hong Kong, China, the regulation<lb/> even allows the full vertical integration of the four services, i.e. trust management, asset<lb/> management, record-keeping and custodian service. Although the investment managers should be<lb/> different entities from the trustees and custodians, they can all be part of the same financial<lb/> institution.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.2 Governance structure<lb/></head>

			<p>The private sector should play an important role in China&apos;s CPF arrangements. However, there are<lb/> some potential problems. For example, costs are not always transparent, particularly given the<lb/> information asymmetry between service providers and plan sponsors. Consequently fees and<lb/> charges are often higher than in other types of schemes (which has a large impact on the eventual<lb/> pension received). Experience from other pension markets suggests that representatives from<lb/> employees and employers should have their ―voice‖ heard to some extent during the decision<lb/> making process regarding the appointment of professional trustees. For example, one option for<lb/> consideration in the Chinese context is an advisory board with employee and employer<lb/> representatives, overseeing the appointment of external service providers. Such a board may be<lb/> required if more than a certain number of employees (e.g. 50) from the same firm are due to be<lb/> enrolled in a pension plan as in the case in Australia. In any case, it should be stressed that<lb/> beneficiaries of the plans (i.e. employees under the China&apos;s DC based EA plans) should be<lb/> actively involved in the selection process of external trustees, as they are the ultimate risk bearers<lb/> and may pay for much of the cost of management of these plans.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.3. Risk control<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the different nature of professional trustees and pension councils, different risk control<lb/> mechanisms could be used. As specified in Decree 23, minimum capital requirements should be<lb/> imposed on the financial institutions which apply for corporate trustee licenses. Such a<lb/> requirement which is common in OECD countries and Hong Kong, China not only indicates a<lb/> commitment by the financial institutions, but also serves as a buffer against various operational<lb/> risks. For example, in Australia, it is required that the trustee of a publicly offered fund should<lb/> have a minimum capitalisation of AUS$ 5 million, while this requirement is HK$ 150 million for<lb/> the MPF system in Hong Kong, China. In addition, as with the pension council model, trustees<lb/> should be required to purchase indemnity insurance to serve as an extra layer of protection.<lb/> Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, China, 0.03% of assets are deducted from the scheme assets, as a form<lb/> of compensation levy.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper, we have reviewed and discussed China&apos;s occupational pension (Enterprise Annuities,<lb/> EA) system in general and collective pension funds (CPFs) in particular. CPFs already exist in<lb/> China, in the form of industry funds (e.g. electricity funds), and regional EA administration<lb/> centres. However, recent statistics show that 99% of the EA assets accumulated were from the<lb/> profitable large state-owned enterprises, despite the fact that SMEs accounted for 55% of the<lb/> overall GDP and 75% of total employment in China (as of February 2006).<lb/> Some of the main reasons SMEs are reluctant to establish EA plans include the lack of collective<lb/> bargaining mechanism (highlighted by lack of regular communication mechanism between trade<lb/> unions and the employers), and high administrative costs (for example the costs involved in<lb/> lengthy procedure of setting up internal pension councils or high fees charged by external<lb/> financial institutions). Given the international experience reviewed in this paper, while bearing in<lb/> mind the Chinese current situations, we propose the following options regarding how to bring<lb/> SMEs to the EA system in China:<lb/></p>

			<p>1) Existing industry funds could open their membership to other companies (including SMEs<lb/> in unrelated industries). This may be the fastest way to bring employees in SMEs into the<lb/> formal EA system in China, although only those industry funds which have been<lb/> restructured to meet Decrees 20 and 23 would be permitted to open up their membership.<lb/></p>

			<p>2) Along the lines of the above point, new (purpose-built) industry funds (with open or<lb/> closed membership) could be established, as long as a collective bargaining mechanism is<lb/> in place. In this case, industry associations and trade unions at different levels should play<lb/> the lead role.<lb/></p>

			<p>3) Regional EA administration centres could be set up under the framework of an internal<lb/> pension council. Such a development could be integrated into the government&apos;s plan to<lb/> externalise the EA assets managed by the local EA administration centres by 2007. Given<lb/> the our proposed governance structure proposed in this paper (involving employer and<lb/> employer representation as well as non-voting government advisors), all the key parties<lb/> involved in these restructured regional EA administration centres would have incentives to<lb/> participate. These CPFs may be a viable and less costly alternative to those established by<lb/> commercial trustees. As cost considerations are critical for SMEs, the promotion of low-<lb/>cost CPF arrangements would go a long way towards extending the coverage of the</p>

			<table>EA<lb/> system to employers in this sector.<lb/> 4) Private sector financial institutions acting as external trustees should be encouraged to<lb/> offer open CPF products. This is not only in line with international experiences (e.g. the<lb/> active role played by insurance companies and asset managers in OECD countries), but<lb/> also consistent with the expertise developed by the private sector in China in managing<lb/> pension assets. The upcoming new legislation on CPFs in China will have a focus on<lb/> corporate trustees.<lb/> Annex: Detailed description of CPFs in Australia, Hong Kong (China), the Netherlands and<lb/> the United States<lb/> Annex A1.

			<head>1. Overview of occupational pension markets in Australia<lb/></head>

			<p>The Australian occupational pension market (called the superannuation fund market) is arguably<lb/> one of the world&apos;s most developed and sophisticated markets. Participation in occupational<lb/> pensions in Australia is compulsory for most employees and is encouraged through tax incentives<lb/> for all. Broadly speaking, there are various types of superannuation funds in Australia as follows:<lb/>  Corporate funds which are employer-sponsored superannuation funds generally restricted to<lb/> employees of the sponsoring employer.<lb/>  Industry superannuation funds which were originally open only to employees in companies<lb/> within a certain industry.<lb/>  Public sector funds implementing schemes that cover public sector employees.<lb/>  Master trusts which are offered to the public and to employers by financial service providers.<lb/></p>

			<figure> Self managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) which are funds with fewer than five members,<lb/> where each member is also a trustee of the fund and none of the members are arms length<lb/> employees of other members. Such funds are not prudentially supervised given the identity of<lb/> interests.<lb/>  Retirement saving accounts (RSAs) which are a contractual form of low cost saving similar to<lb/> term deposits. They are capital guaranteed products offered by deposit taking institutions or<lb/> life insurance companies.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Of all the different funds above, the SMSFs have witnessed rapid growth in recent years, due to<lb/> increased demand from individuals on choice of investment, while the number of corporate funds<lb/> has decreased following new regulation on the licensing of trustees in 2006.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Profile of collective pension funds<lb/></head>

			<p>Both industry funds and master trusts exist in Australia.<lb/></p>

			<p>Industry funds draw members from a range of employers across a single industry (or group of<lb/> related industries) and are usually established under an agreement between the parties to an<lb/> industrial award. Industry funds are similar to corporate funds, in that they have standard<lb/> employer sponsors and are traditionally ―non-public offer‖ (closed funds). In recent years many<lb/> industry funds have become ―public offer‖, meaning that they are open funds and members from<lb/> the general public (including SMEs) can now join. Industry funds that are public offer, however,<lb/> still have the vast majority of their members from the industry for which the fund was established.<lb/></p>

			<p>There were 82 industry funds in Australia as of September 2006 and the total amount of assets<lb/> under management was AUS$ 162 billion (i.e. 17.2% of the market share). Examples 13 include<lb/>  BUSSQ (Building Unions Superannuation Scheme (Queensland), which provides benefits<lb/> for all employees in the Queensland building and construction industry<lb/>  CARE Super, which targets people engaged in professional, managerial, administrative,<lb/> service and related occupations (it is now a public offer fund, therefore open to SMEs)<lb/>  Asset Super, which as a multi-industry public offer fund, covers employees in various<lb/> sectors and professions, , e.g. vineyards, doctors/dentists, charities and internet companies<lb/> In Australia, the most common form of industry funds is a multi-industry fund, which has<lb/> traditionally covered a range of related industries but now is becoming more dispersed. For<lb/> example, the former Australian Retirement Fund (ARF) used to cover textile clothing and<lb/> footwear, cleaning and printing industries, etc. In July 2006, the Australian Retirement Fund<lb/> (ARF) and the Superannuation Trust of Australia (STA) merged and became one of the largest<lb/> multi-industry funds in Australia. Accordingly, the new fund (renamed as AustraliaSuper) covers<lb/> a diverse range of industries, including automotive, metal, cleaning and training, etc.<lb/></p>

			<p>Master trusts are superannuation entities that offer superannuation products to the public on a<lb/> commercial ‗for profit&apos; basis. Master trusts are usually run by large financial institutions which<lb/> provide a range of wealth management products. Included in the retail category are large public<lb/> offer superannuation trusts that comprise a number of smaller funds (sub-funds) that have been<lb/> consolidated into the larger trust. These entities are commonly known as superannuation master<lb/> trusts and have become increasingly popular over the last few years. Multi-member approved<lb/> deposit funds and eligible rollover funds are also considered to be master trusts. As of September<lb/> 2006, 186 master trusts were operated in Australia with assets under management at AUS$ 306<lb/> billion (representing 32.4% of the total market; the largest market player).<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Institutional Framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Since June 2006, all trustees operating an APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority)<lb/> regulated superannuation entity must hold a Registrable Superannuation Entity (RSE) License, but<lb/> trustees of self-managed superannuation funds regulated by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)<lb/> and some public sector superannuation schemes are exempted from this requirement. In addition,<lb/> all superannuation entities except for the self-managed superannuation funds and some public<lb/> schemes should register with the APRA. Only an RSE licensee can register a superannuation<lb/> entity 14 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Industry funds<lb/></head>

			<p>For non-public offer industry funds (and other standard employer-sponsored funds) in Australia,<lb/> there is a requirement of equal representation of employees and employers on the board of<lb/> trustees or the group of individual trustees. In this case, the employee (employer) representatives<lb/> should be nominated by the employees (employers) of the fund or organisations representing the<lb/> interests of the employees (employers), and they are not necessarily the members of the fund.<lb/> Regarding public offer industry funds, trustees should be structured either:<lb/>  meeting the equal representation requirements on employees and employers; or<lb/>  having an independent trustee and complying with rules relating to policy committees of an<lb/> advisory nature (i.e. these committees should have equal numbers of employee and employer<lb/> representatives).<lb/> Meanwhile, based on the current legislation on non-public offer funds, it is possible to have an<lb/> additional independent trustee or trustee board director, with the basic equal representation rules<lb/> still being met. A trustee or director is defined as ―independent‖, if he/she is<lb/>  not a member of the fund;<lb/>  not an employer-sponsor or associate of an employer-sponsor of the fund;<lb/>  not an employee of an employer-sponsor of the fund or an employee of an associate of such an<lb/> employer-sponsor;<lb/>  not in any capacity a representative of an organisation, such as an trade union, representing the<lb/> interests of one or more members of the fund; and<lb/>  not in any capacity a representative of an organisation representing the interests of one or<lb/> more employer-sponsor of the fund.<lb/></p>

			<p>The general practice is that only one additional independent trustee or board director is appointed.<lb/> However, it is possible to appoint more than one trustee if it is approved by the board and APRA.<lb/> Meanwhile, the additional independent trustees or directors have a deliberative vote, rather than<lb/> the casting vote. In other words, when equality of votes happens, they cannot have an additional<lb/> ―second‖ vote.<lb/></p>

			<p>When public offer funds decide to establish policy committees, there is no scope to appoint<lb/> additional independent representatives from either employees or employers to these committees,<lb/> since by definition the trustee is already independent.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, any unreasonable restriction in preventing certain groups of members from being<lb/> nominated is not allowed. However, the current legislation allows setting quotas for member<lb/> representatives from specific sites or geographical locations in order to ensure appropriate<lb/> representation of all classes of members within a fund.<lb/></p>

			<p>Trustees should purchase appropriate insurance against any liability to which they may be<lb/> exposed when they conduct their fiduciary duties. However, there are legal exceptions where such<lb/> indemnification does not apply, i.e. when trustees<lb/>  act dishonestly in relation to the fund;<lb/>  recklessly or deliberately fall to exercise the degree of care or diligence that a trustee is<lb/> required to exercise; or<lb/>  are subject to a monetary penalty under a civil penalty order.<lb/></p>

			<head>Master trusts<lb/></head>

			<p>When discussing public offer (open industry) funds above, mention is made of the fact that<lb/> trustees could be independent, which implicitly refers to master trusts where commercial trustees<lb/> are in charge. In this regard, the current legislation allows (not requires) the establishment of<lb/> ―policy committees‖ where there must be equal representation of employee and employer<lb/> representatives. However, when there are 50 or more members with the same or an associated<lb/> employer-sponsor (a ―group‖), at least one policy committee should be set up for that group.<lb/> Establishment of policy committees is in theory a way to monitor the performance of the<lb/> independent trustees and the main functions are to advise and inform the trustees on issues which<lb/> are raised by members or employer-sponsors of the particular fund. However, the ultimate<lb/> fiduciary duties still remain with the independent trustees, and policy committees cannot limit<lb/> trustees&apos; ability and responsibilities of fulfilling such duties. It has been observed that the policy<lb/> committee is largely operated as an advisory board and is not generally involved in daily<lb/> operation of retails funds in Australia.<lb/></p>

			<p>Meanwhile, for master trusts, the ―one-stop shopping‖ model is common, in that trusteeship,<lb/> account administrator and/or asset management are conducted by different/separate subsidiaries of<lb/> the same large financial institution. For example, the Aon Master Trust was established in 1990 in<lb/> Australia. The trustee of this master trust is Aon Superannuation Pty Limited (a wholly-owned<lb/> subsidiary of Aon Corporation), while the account administrator is Aon Consulting Pty Limited<lb/> (also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon Corporation). Meanwhile, consulting services of the Aon<lb/> Master Trust are provided by Aon Consulting Pty Limited as well. In terms of members of trustee<lb/> board, they are mainly from and appointed by the financial institution, while employer-sponsors<lb/> play a less significant role in this context. Board members are normally paid, and their<lb/> remuneration is determined between the sponsoring financial institution (e.g. Aon Corporation)<lb/> and the subsidiary trustee (e.g. Aon Superannuation Pty Limited).<lb/> Due to commercial trustees&apos; knowledge and expertise on finance and investment, it is argued that<lb/> they are able to provide better professional service and offer more (even tailor-made) investment<lb/> options for customers, when compared to industry funds. However, due to their ―for-profit‖ nature,<lb/> the fee charged by the former is normally higher than that of other funds. Some statistics show<lb/> that large industry funds tend to be the lowest cost operators in the superannuation sector in<lb/> Australia.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Key characteristics<lb/> 4.1 Strong position of industry funds<lb/></head>

			<p>Industry funds are an important player in Australia&apos;s superannuation system. In terms of total<lb/> number of member accounts, over one-third (i.e. 9.7 million out of 28.9 million) belonged to<lb/> industry funds as of June 2006. When it comes to total assets under management, the difference<lb/> is less marked, in that it accounted for 17.2% of the total superannuation assets in 2006. This ratio,<lb/> however, increased from 16.0% in 2005, following the asset inflow from corporate funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Increasing popularity of master trusts<lb/></head>

			<p>As of 2006, master trusts were the most popular superannuation arrangement in Australia, in that<lb/> their assets represented 32.4% of the total market, while the ratio was over 50% in terms of<lb/> number of member accounts. Its popularity might be due to professional service and richer<lb/> investment choices for investors as well as the ―the brand reputation‖ and cross selling of services<lb/> within a group.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Equal representation of employee and employer representatives<lb/></head>

			<p>The concept of equal representation has been implemented in Australia. For example, for non-<lb/>public offer funds, equal numbers of employee and employer representatives should sit on the<lb/> board of trustees or group of individual trustees. For the public-offer funds or where an<lb/> independent trustee is hired, or when more than 50 members come from the same or associated<lb/> employer sponsor, policy committees with equal representation of employees and employers<lb/> should be established.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4. Licensing requirement<lb/></head>

			<p>Since June 2006, the APRA requires that all superannuation trustees demonstrate to APRA that<lb/> they have adequate resources (staff, technology and financial) and appropriate skills and expertise<lb/> to manage superannuation funds, as described in the earlier section. The licensing requirement is<lb/> utilised to improve robustness of the superannuation system and protect beneficiaries&apos; interests.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Main merits and weaknesses:<lb/> 5.1. Merits<lb/></head>

			<p>First, active involvement of trade unions and relevant industry associations helps and sustains the<lb/> development and growth of industry funds in Australia. As noted, whether the trustee of the<lb/> industry funds is structured as a group of individual trustees or a corporation, interests of<lb/> employers and employees should be represented. In this context, trade unions and industry<lb/> associations have played a leading role in Australia.<lb/> Second, equal representation of employees and employers has been implemented in Australian<lb/> CPFs, in that for industry funds, equal numbers of employee and employer representatives have to<lb/> sit on the board of trustees, while for the master trusts, the same policy has to be implemented on<lb/> the board of policy committees.<lb/> Third, the private sector has played an important role in Australian CPFs, which to some extent<lb/> enhances beneficiaries&apos; benefits, for example by providing more innovative investment products<lb/> and choices for members.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p>First, although equal representation has been achieved on the board of trustees of industry funds,<lb/> it is noted that many of the representatives are nominated by the largest trade unions or industry<lb/> associations. Therefore, does it imply that employees and employers of the smaller employers are<lb/> under-represented on the board?<lb/> Second, in the master trusts, all trustees are appointed by the financial institutions, and members<lb/> and employer sponsors cannot remove them if their performance is not satisfactory. The only<lb/> solution is to switch to another fund.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, cost is also a concern for the master trusts in Australia, which typically are among the<lb/> highest cost superannuation operators, although they may possibly provide better services.<lb/> Industry funds have historically provided higher net-of-fees returns to members than master trusts.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Challenges:<lb/></head>

			<p>For industry funds, the main challenge is how to ensure representation of employees and<lb/> employers by size of employers (i.e. the current system is dominated by largest ones). For master<lb/> trusts, how to align commercial interests and fiduciary duties is a difficult question. Meanwhile,<lb/> action should be taken to have policy committees (set by the commercial trustees) more involved<lb/> in the running of the funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>Annex A2. Hong Kong, China<lb/> 1. Overview of the Mandatory Provident Fund in Hong Kong, China<lb/></head>

			<p>In</p>

			<table>Hong Kong, China the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) system was first introduced in 1995<lb/> when Hong Kong, China decided to implement the multi-pillar pension system, and became<lb/> operational in 2000. As of end of 2006, 232,000 employers participated in the MPF, and there<lb/> were around 2.4 million members. The total assets amounted to HKD 202 billion, representing<lb/> around 13.7% of GDP.<lb/></table>

			<p>The MPF system is based on mandatory, defined contribution pension fund managed on a<lb/> collective basis. Employers and employees each contribute 5% of the employee&apos;s relevant income<lb/> to a registered MPF scheme, subject to the maximum and minimum levels of income for<lb/> contribution purposes. The self-employed must also contribute 5% of their relevant income. The<lb/> accrued benefits are fully vested in the scheme members and can be transferred from scheme to<lb/> scheme when workers change employer or cease to be employed. Under normal circumstances,<lb/> benefits must be preserved until the scheme member attains the retirement age of 65.<lb/> Contributions, investment income and benefits are all tax exempt. Funds are managed by private<lb/> sector fund managers. Employers choose both trustees and MPF schemes for their employees,<lb/> although employees have the right to choose the constituent/investment funds within each MPF<lb/> scheme. Most schemes offer four to six constituent funds, varying from conservative to aggressive,<lb/> and must include a capital preservation fund as one option. Strict quantitative and qualitative<lb/> restrictions apply to the investment of funds, but these are under constant review in the light of the<lb/> market development. The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) regulates and<lb/> monitors the operation of the MPF system and MPF trustees&apos; compliance with statutory<lb/> requirements. The MPF system has become the main retirement protection system in Hong Kong,<lb/> China.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Plan profile of the MPF schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>There are three types of MPF schemes in Hong Kong, China, and two of them are sort of<lb/> collective pension arrangements, while the other one is the standard single employer-sponsored<lb/> pension scheme.<lb/></p>

			<head>Employer-sponsored scheme:</head>

			<p>This refers to the occupational mandatory provident fund scheme<lb/> sponsored by a single employer (and its associated companies), the membership of which is only<lb/> open to the employees of this employer (and of its associated companies). At the moment, there<lb/> are only two employer sponsored schemes in Hong Kong, China, and they are Jones Lang Lasalle<lb/> Property Management Division MPF Scheme and SHKP MPF Employer Sponsored Scheme.<lb/></p>

			<p>Industry scheme: At present, two industry schemes exist for the catering and construction<lb/> industries, and they are only open to employees and self-employed persons in the two industries.<lb/> The reason for establishing industry schemes is mainly due to the high labour mobility and<lb/> turnover in the two industries. Therefore, if a person changes jobs but stays within the same<lb/> industry, he/she does not need to change pension schemes. Accrued pension rights are fully<lb/> portable within the industry. Employers in the two industries may choose to enrol their employees<lb/> in the industry schemes, or in the other two types of schemes, i.e. employer-sponsored schemes or<lb/> master trust schemes. Examples of coverage for these two industries are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<table>Catering industry<lb/>  Food factories, milk factories<lb/>  Restaurants<lb/>  Chinese herbal tea shops<lb/> Construction industry<lb/>  Civil engineering<lb/>  Refurbishment and maintenance and other similar works<lb/>  Gas, plumbing, drainage and other similar works<lb/></table>

			<p>Master trust scheme: This is the most popular form of mandatory provident fund arrangement<lb/> in Hong Kong, China, and the membership is open to the employees of more than one employer,<lb/> self-employed persons and persons with accrued benefits transferred from other schemes. By<lb/> pooling the contributions of small employer units together for administration and investment, such<lb/> master trust arrangements may have a high degree of efficiency resulting from economies of scale.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Institutional Framework<lb/></head>

			<p>In general in Hong Kong, China, public and private-sector employees and self-employed persons<lb/> aged between 18 and 65 must become members of a provident fund scheme. This obligation<lb/> applies to full-time and part-time workers holding a contract of 60 days or more. Meanwhile,<lb/> every employer must enrol all employees in a mandatory provident fund scheme within 60 days of<lb/> the employment commencing (10 days in the case of casual employees of the construction and<lb/> catering industries).<lb/> All MPF schemes in Hong Kong, China have to be established under a trust with trustees<lb/> approved by the MPFA. In this context, trustees could be corporate trustees or a group of<lb/> individual trustees.<lb/> A registered trust company incorporated in Hong Kong which applies for approval as trustee must:<lb/>  Comply with the prescribed capital adequacy requirements;<lb/>  Have at least five directors of which all must be individuals;<lb/>  Have sufficient presence and control in Hong Kong;<lb/>  Satisfy the MPFA that it is capable of carrying out the business of administering registered<lb/> schemes for which purpose the MPFA may enter and inspect the premises intended to be<lb/> used by the company for carrying out the business of administering registered schemes;<lb/>  Not engage in any other business than trust business;<lb/>  Satisfy the MPFA that all of the controllers of the company are persons of good reputation<lb/> and character and, in particular, have not been found guilty, whether in Hong Kong or<lb/> elsewhere, of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty;<lb/>  Satisfy the MPFA that the chief executive officer and a majority of directors (which must<lb/> include an independent director) of the company have collectively the skill, knowledge<lb/> and experience that are necessary for the successful administration of provident fund<lb/> schemes.<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted above, in order to ensure efficiency of the (corporate) trustee, current legislation requires<lb/> that at least one member of the trustee board should be independent director. For this independent<lb/> director, he or she must meet the following criteria:<lb/>  Not be an employee or partner of the trust company, or of an associate of the trust<lb/> company;<lb/>  Not be a director of an associate of the trust company;<lb/>  Not hold any shares of the trust company or of any associate of the trust company;<lb/>  Satisfy the MPFA that there is no past or present association (financial or otherwise) that<lb/> could affect his/her impartiality.<lb/></p>

			<p>A registered trust company incorporated in Hong Kong and a company incorporated outside Hong<lb/> Kong must accompany the application with a written report prepared by an auditor appointed by<lb/> the applicant that must state whether or not the applicant complies with the prescribed capital<lb/> requirements of:<lb/></p>

			<p> Having a paid-up share capital of at least HKD 150 Million;<lb/>  Owning net assets of at least the same amount;<lb/>  Owning assets held in Hong Kong to the value of at least HKD 15 Million.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key responsibilities of the trustees include:<lb/></head>

			<p> Select asset managers and monitor their performance on an ongoing basis;<lb/>  Manage the contribution and benefit administration themselves;<lb/>  Appoint a custodian to hold the scheme assets (an approved trustee may be custodian<lb/> under specific circumstances);<lb/>  Establish a separate individual account for each scheme member;<lb/>  Ensure that each member&apos;s account is kept in such a manner that the market value of the<lb/> accrued benefits of a member can be ascertained at least once a month.<lb/> According to the current legislation, there is no requirement regarding representation of<lb/> employees and employers on the plan&apos;s board of trustees for all three forms of MPF schemes,<lb/> although the MPFA itself has a statutory committee consisting of equal number of representatives<lb/> from employees and employers. In order to ensure the efficient operation of the trust-based MPF<lb/> system, the MPFA adopts a risk-based supervisory approach, which is complemented by on-site<lb/> visits and off-site monitoring as well as a set of compliance standards on trustees and guidelines<lb/> on investment and scheme operation etc. Meanwhile, in order to meet the potential losses suffered<lb/> by the beneficiaries, e.g. due to fraud of trustees, 0.03% of the MPF assets are deducted from the<lb/> scheme assets as the compensation fund levy. If in any case, the compensation funds are<lb/> insufficient funds to cover the losses, the Financial Secretary may provide grants or loans out of<lb/> the general government revenue.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this context, the trustee(s) must have adequate insurance in respect of a registered scheme, so<lb/> that beneficiaries could be indemnified against losses as a result of the maladministration of the<lb/> scheme by a trustee or by any service provider appointed to the scheme. Such insurance should<lb/> cover a specified amount/percentage of the total assets under management by the trustees.<lb/> However, if the insurance policy stipulates that the insurer is liable for only the part of a claim<lb/> that exceeds a specified amount (known as the deductible amount), this deductible must not<lb/> exceed:<lb/>  HKD 100,000 if the market value of the trustee(s)&apos; total assets under management is not<lb/> more than HKD 1 Million;<lb/>  The lower of HKD 500,000 and 10% of the market value of the scheme assets if the<lb/> trustee(s)&apos; total assets under management exceed HKD 1 Million.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Key characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, the MPF system in Hong Kong, China has collective pension arrangements for two of its<lb/> components, i.e. industry funds and master trusts. Its key features are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 High participation rate<lb/></head>

			<p>Since its inception, the MPF system has achieved a very high participation rate. For example, as<lb/> of March 2007, the rate was 99.8% for employers, 97.5% for employees and 75.6% for self-<lb/>employed persons. This is mainly due to the fact that participation in the MPF schemes is<lb/> mandatory according to the current regulation.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Popularity of the master trust schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted in the earlier sections, the MPF system has three components, but the most popular one<lb/> is the master trust scheme. For example, as of March 2007, of 40 existing schemes, 36 were the<lb/> master trust schemes, with two industry schemes and two employer-sponsor schemes. Meanwhile,<lb/> out of the 318 constituent funds, 295 were with the master trust schemes, while the remaining 23<lb/> were with industry schemes and employer sponsored schemes.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Important role played by the private sector<lb/></head>

			<p>In Hong Kong, China, the private sector is playing an important role in the occupational pension<lb/> markets. For example, service providers can be a group of individual trustees or corporate entities.<lb/> Furthermore, in this context, corporate trustees play the most important role, since as of March<lb/> 2007 the MPFA did not receive any application from individuals for the trustee licenses.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4 Licensing requirements for service providers<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the introduction of the MPS system in Hong Kong, China, trustees (individual or corporate)<lb/> need to be approved to carry on the MPF-related businesses by the MPFA. As of March 2007,<lb/> there were 19 corporate trustees.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Main merits and weaknesses:<lb/> 5.1 Main merits<lb/></head>

			<p>First, partly due to the extensive participation of the private sector in the MPF system and also<lb/> economies of scale, small and medium size employers have been able to join the MPF without<lb/> incurring too much cost. It is mainly achieved through the provision of master trusts by the<lb/> financial institutions.<lb/> Second, asset management benefits from professional expertise. Since all the approved trustees<lb/> (individual or corporate) have to satisfy the MPFA that they have skill, care and qualification of<lb/> managing the MPF assets properly, it might to some extent ensure the professional management<lb/> of the assets. It is particularly noticeable in the case of Hong Kong, China, that only corporate<lb/> trustees are used by the MPF schemes.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Main weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p>First, the potential risk of conflict of interests exists within the MPF system in Hong Kong, China.<lb/> The current legislation allows such vertical integration where the custody and other services are<lb/> combined in one institution. For example, Bank Consortium Trust (BCT) serves as the trustee,<lb/> administrator and custodian of their managed MPF schemes, but the investment managers are still<lb/> different financial institutions (i.e. not part of the BCT group). Although it is claimed that such<lb/> ―one-stop shopping‖ has the benefits of cost efficiency, it does have potential problem of conflict<lb/> of interests, and indeed in many other countries, the custodian is always separate from other<lb/> service providers. Meanwhile, as noted in the preceding section, on the one hand, heavy use of<lb/> professional corporate trustees could benefit from their specialist knowledge and expertise; on the<lb/> other hand, the question as to how to align the commercial interests with their fiduciary duties is<lb/> difficult to answer.<lb/> Second, relatively high level of fees has been observed in Hong Kong, China, and it is one of the<lb/> main concerns for employees and members, since such charges and fees could reduce a significant<lb/> portion of the returns achieved by the financial institutions. This issue is particularly important for<lb/> pension fund assets given their long investment horizon.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Challenges:<lb/></head>

			<p>Similarly to the master trusts in Australia, the question regarding how to ensure independent<lb/> governance for the master trusts and align commercial interests and fiduciary responsibilities<lb/> remains a big challenge for policymakers. In this context, the related point of high costs needs to<lb/> be addressed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Annex A3. The Netherlands<lb/> 1. Overview of occupational pension markets in the Netherlands<lb/></head>

			<p>Although there is no obligation for employers to set up supplementary pension plans for their<lb/> employees, besides the compulsory old-age pension provisions (AOW), over 90% of employees<lb/> in the Netherlands are covered by three main types of occupational pension plans.<lb/></p>

			<p>The three types are company pensions, industry-wide pensions and professional pensions.<lb/> Company pension plans financed through stand-alone pension funds, are largely set up by the<lb/> large enterprises, like Royal Dutch Shell and Philips. Industry-wide pensions are mainly<lb/> established for employees and employers in a particular industry, and could become compulsory<lb/> subject to collective agreements between employers and employees and authorisation from the<lb/> government. Professional pensions mainly target self-employed employees in a particular<lb/> profession. The Dutch government can also make participation in a pension scheme for a<lb/> professional group mandatory for the profession as a whole, if under the request of an<lb/> organisation or organisations representing a sufficient majority of the profession concerned.<lb/> According to the existing legislation, pension commitments have to be financed on the basis of<lb/> capital funding, and be kept outside of the balance sheet of the sponsoring companies. This could<lb/> be achieved either in the form of a pension fund or by entering into an agreement with insurance<lb/> companies. Meanwhile, by the legal requirement, pension assets have to be able to meet liabilities<lb/> at a certain level. This requirement is particular relevant in the Netherlands, in that 90% of<lb/> occupational pension members still participate in defined-benefit schemes.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Plan profile of the industry-wide pension schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>The CPFs in the Netherlands, with a history of several decades, are mainly organised in the form<lb/> of industry-wide pension funds. Indeed, industry funds are a popular pension arrangement in the<lb/> Netherlands, and over 80% of the work-force who participate in occupational pensions in the<lb/> Netherlands is covered by the industry-wide pension funds. At the moment, there are more than<lb/> 70 industry-wide pension funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>As implied by the name, industry-wide pension funds are normally open to members in a<lb/> particular industry. Typical examples include<lb/>  The Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP: The largest pension fund in Europe covers employees<lb/> working for the Dutch governments and the educational sector.<lb/>  PGGM: The 2 nd largest pension fund in the Netherlands, and provides pension services for<lb/> employees in the healthcare and social work sector.<lb/>  Horeca &amp; Catering: One of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands, and its participants<lb/> are mainly from the hotel, restaurant and catering industry.<lb/> Popularity of the industry funds largely originates from the historical reason of open and<lb/> constructive social dialogue mechanisms between employers and employee in the Netherlands,<lb/> under which representatives of employees and employers have a good reputation in representing<lb/> the interests of their respective parties. Therefore, both employees and employers have a positive<lb/> view on the establishment of industry-wide funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Institutional Framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Pension funds (including industry funds) in the Netherlands are established on the basis of a<lb/> pension foundation. The main difference between a foundation and a trust (on which pension<lb/> funds are based in Anglo-Saxon countries) is that the former originates from civil law, while the<lb/> latter has its base in common law. Nevertheless, industry funds in the Netherlands have a legal<lb/> personality and should be operated separately from the employers&apos; assets and solely for the<lb/> interests of beneficiaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The current legislations allow both employees and employers jointly to set up an industry fund.<lb/> Furthermore, if the social partners (i.e. representatives from employees and employers) agree,<lb/> they could ask the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment to impose an obligation on all<lb/> employers and employees with their industries and require all of them to participate in this<lb/> industry-wide fund. In this context, however, such a request to establish a compulsory industry<lb/> fund has to be approved by the employer representatives who represent the interests of employers<lb/> which employ at least 60% of the total workforce in that industry. There are no similar<lb/> corresponding requirements on the employee representatives. Such compulsory participation,<lb/> however, could be waived, if a particular company within the industry has already set up an<lb/> individual pension fund, or when the performance of the industry fund is not satisfactory to meet<lb/> the statutory requirements (i.e. matching of assets and liabilities). This system of compulsory<lb/> participation is in line with the rulings of the European Court of Justice on the relation between<lb/> competition law and labour law in connection with compulsory membership in a pension scheme.<lb/> Regarding the governance structure of the industry funds, there are three key components.<lb/></p>

			<p>1) Management<lb/> This refers to executives or professional managers who manage the pension funds under<lb/> supervision of the governing body, and they are mainly in charge of the day-to-day management<lb/> of the industry funds. The current legislation requires that the funds should be in the hands of at<lb/> least two persons.<lb/> Meanwhile, in order to ensure the smooth running of the pension funds, the management of the<lb/> funds must prove to the satisfaction of the pension regulator (i.e. De Nederlandsche Bank) that at<lb/> least two of its members possess specialist expertise, such as<lb/>  The governance of an organisation<lb/></p>

			<table> Legal and regulatory issues<lb/>  Financial investment and actuarial knowledge<lb/>  Accounting and auditing<lb/> 2) Governing body<lb/> For this layer of the pension funds, stakeholders (i.e. plan members and employers) should be<lb/> equally represented on the so-called governing board, and they are normally nominated and<lb/> appointed by the relevant trade unions and industry associations. For example, for the<lb/> Pensioenfonds Horeca &amp; Catering, the governing body has equal numbers of representatives from<lb/> the employer organisation, i.e. Koninklijke Horeca Nederland and, the trade union organisations<lb/> FNV Horecabond and CNV BedrijvenBond.<lb/> Due to concerns on conflict of interests, the following persons should not serve as members of the<lb/> board of foundation:<lb/>  Employees of the pension funds<lb/>  Members and former members of the governing body and committees of the pension funds<lb/>  Advisors of the pension fund<lb/></table>

			<p>Normally there is one chairperson on the board of foundation. However, the dual-chairperson<lb/> system has been implemented in some Dutch industry funds. For example, the Pensioenfonds<lb/> Horeca &amp; Catering has two chairpersons; one (called employee chairperson) is appointed by and<lb/> represents the employees and the other one (called employer chairperson) represents employers.<lb/> The two chairpersons, however, rotate to chair the board on a yearly basis during the term. This is<lb/> especially important, in that the chairperson has an extra vote in the event of a tied vote, but full<lb/> consensus still remains the basic objective of any Dutch board of foundation.<lb/></p>

			<p>3) Advisory board<lb/> It mainly advises the governing body or board of foundation on various issues (e.g. investment<lb/> strategies) of the funds, either on a specific request from the board of foundation, or on their own<lb/> accord. Regarding the member composition of the board, representatives from both employers and<lb/> employees frequently sit on the board. This board serves the same purpose as the policy<lb/> committees set up by the Australian master trusts.<lb/> 4) Funding of defined benefit plans<lb/> Meanwhile, all funds in the Netherlands are subject to the financial supervisory requirements laid<lb/> down in the Pension Act (which came into force on 1 January 2007) and the regulations based<lb/> upon this act. Under the new requirements, pension funds will be required to achieve a coverage<lb/> ratio (i.e., the ratio of the present value of assets over liabilities, based on marked-to-market<lb/> calculations) implied by a 97½ percent probability of meeting their obligations. In cases where the<lb/> indexation of benefits to inflation/wages is not guaranteed, this implies a coverage ratio, on<lb/> average, of 130 percent, to be met within a period agreed on with the supervisor not exceeding 15<lb/> years (the required coverage ratio would be higher if funds provided guarantees). However, if the<lb/> ratio falls below 105 percent, it has to be restored within a given time period (likely between one<lb/> and three years, but this is being discussed in parliament), except at times of severe<lb/> macroeconomic downturns or systematic risk.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Key characteristics<lb/> 4.1 Equal representation<lb/></head>

			<p>As described earlier, the governing body of the industry funds is required to have equal numbers<lb/> of representatives from members and employers. Meanwhile, the policy of representation<lb/> (although not necessarily equal representation) also applies to the advisory board. Another<lb/> interesting observation is that for some industry funds, it is even possible that the board is chaired<lb/> by two chairpersons, although they two fulfil this responsibility on a rotation basis.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Compulsory participation<lb/></head>

			<p>Although it is not compulsory for a Dutch employer to have an occupational pension plan, for the<lb/> industry funds, by relevant legislation, it is allowed for the government to make such participation<lb/> compulsory if the employer representatives representing a significant proportion of the industry<lb/> make such a request.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Large size of the industry fund industry<lb/></head>

			<p>The size of the industry-wide pension funds in the Netherlands is large, in terms of both assets and<lb/> the number of participants. It might be due to historical reasons of strong unionisation in the<lb/> Netherlands, and the de facto compulsory participation in most industry-wide funds as noted<lb/> above.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Main merits and weaknesses:<lb/> 5.1. Merits<lb/></head>

			<p>First, largely due to the common feature of mandatory participation, members within a particular<lb/> industry could pool all their pension assets in a single fund, which then can achieve economies of<lb/> scale. Indeed, the Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP is not only very large in the Netherlands, but it is<lb/> also the largest pension fund in Europe, and one of the largest arguably in the world.<lb/> Second, like industry funds in other countries, equal representation of employee and employer<lb/> representatives has been adopted in the Dutch industry fund industry. Meanwhile, the existence of<lb/> dual chairperson mechanism which is innovative could serve as an extra layer protecting the<lb/> interests of employees and employers.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p>The main disadvantage of collective pension systems is the lack of individual choice and tailor-<lb/>made solutions. But to the Dutch view these disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages<lb/> of collective arrangements.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Challenges:<lb/></head>

			<p>The main ―problem‖ of the Dutch industry-wide pension system is how to meet the challenges of<lb/> ageing and transparency.<lb/></p>

			<head>Annex A4. The United States<lb/> 1. Overview of occupational pension markets in the United States<lb/></head>

			<p>The system of occupational pension plans in the United States rests squarely on a foundation of<lb/> tax considerations. In common with many other countries, the tax advantages can be substantial<lb/> for both employers and employees. Indeed, it can be argued that these tax advantages are the<lb/> primary reason for the existence of occupational retirement plans.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a distinction in the United States between a ―qualified pension plan‖ under which<lb/> systematic annuity payments are made to retired employees over a period of years (usually for life)<lb/> and a ―qualified defined contribution plan (other than a defined contribution pension plan)‖. The<lb/> former can be either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC). The latter encompasses<lb/> various profit-sharing, thrift and savings plans, where benefit distribution is normally in the form<lb/> of a lump sum, and pre-retirement payments are sometimes possible (e.g. hardship).<lb/> Thus, complementary to Social Security (OASDI), there is a wide array of employment-related<lb/> programs addressing retirement and long-term savings. The most important are:<lb/></p>

			<figure> defined benefit (DB) pension plans, including cash balance plans;<lb/>  defined contribution (DC) pension plans;<lb/>  multi-employer pension plans;<lb/>  simplified employee pension plans (SEPs) for small employers;<lb/>  401(k) plans, an important and US-specific variation of DC plans; B(k) plans, a recently<lb/> introduced alternative that allows a DB pension plan and a 401(k) plan to operate as a single<lb/> package;<lb/>  savings and thrift plans – now mostly replaced by 401(k) plans.<lb/>  employee stock ownership plans – a form of DC plan where the investments are primarily in<lb/> employer stock;<lb/>  profit-sharing plans – a form of DC plan under which contributions are traditionally a function<lb/> of company profits;<lb/>  stock bonus plans – under which contributions are made in the form of company stock; and<lb/>  tax-favored individual savings plans such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) operating<lb/> under a employer-sponsored group arrangement. A ―simplified employee pension plan‖ – see<lb/> below – is a structured example of this approach.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The third and fourth categories are of greatest relevance to MOLSS and to its objective of<lb/> encouraging the establishment and maintenance of Enterprise Annuities for SMEs. Each will be<lb/> analyzed in turn.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Plan profile of the CPFs<lb/> 2.1 Multi-employer (Taft Hartley) pension plans<lb/></head>

			<p>A Taft-Hartley plan can be either a pension plan or a health benefit plan. The name &quot;Taft-Hartley<lb/> plan&quot; is derived from the Taft-Hartley Act (also known as the Labor-Management Relations Act<lb/> of 1947). The Taft-Hartley Act made it illegal for an employer to contribute to an employee<lb/> benefit plan controlled by a union. As a result, all multi-employer plans must have equal number<lb/> of representatives from management and labour. Other key features of the Taft-Hartley include:<lb/>  the fund receives contributions from more than one employer;<lb/>  the fund is established via collective bargaining between participating employers and unions;<lb/>  the fund is established under a trust, and must be exclusively for the benefits of employees;<lb/>  mobile employees moving within the industry do not need to change schemes as long as the<lb/> existing and recipient employers participate in the same plan.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the above, it could be argued that the multi-employer plan (governed by the Taft-Hartley<lb/> Act) is a pension arrangement between a labour union and a group of unrelated employers<lb/> (usually in a common industry and region). It is the product of collective bargaining between<lb/> organizations representing several employers and one or more unions. Most are defined benefit<lb/> plans providing a flat dollar amount for each year of credited service. For example, a plan<lb/> providing a benefit of $75 per month for each year of credited service would pay a pension of<lb/> $2,250 per month from normal retirement age for a person with 30 years of credited service.<lb/></p>

			<p>Currently, the arrangement has been popular in such industries where workers typically do not<lb/> stay very long with the same employer. Examples include manufacturing industries (e.g. food and<lb/> confectionary, printing and publishing, construction and furniture), and non-manufacturing<lb/> industries (e.g. transport, wholesale and retail trades).<lb/> Almost 10 million employees are covered by multi-employer DB pension plans; 74% are in large<lb/> plans with more than 10,000 participants. More than half of all such employees work in the<lb/> construction and manufacturing sectors, where coverage under single employer plans is very poor.<lb/> The services, retail trade and trucking sectors each account for another 14% of overall<lb/> membership.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Simplified employee pension plans (SEPs) and SIMPLE IRAs<lb/></head>

			<p>Under a SEP or SIMPLE IRA, employer contributions are directed to traditional individual<lb/> retirement accounts called SEP-IRAs. Full-time, part-time and seasonal employees, self-employed<lb/> persons, partners in partnerships, and sole proprietors – all can participate in SEPs. Companies,<lb/> sole proprietors and partnerships can establish such plans. Employer contributions can vary from<lb/> year-to-year, are tax deductible up to 25% of an employee&apos;s salary, and are even eligible for a<lb/> special tax credit for start-up costs.<lb/> Trustees are limited to banks, mutual funds, insurance companies that issue annuity contracts and<lb/> other approved financial institutions. They receive and invest the contributions, administer the<lb/> plan, make all relevant government filings and provide annual statements to each plan participant<lb/> showing employer contributions and the current value of that person&apos;s SEP-IRA. As explained by<lb/> the US Department of Labor: ―A SEP does not have the start-up and operating costs of a<lb/> conventional retirement plan‖ – particularly attractive features for SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Institutional Framework<lb/> 3.1 Multi-employer (Taft Hartley) pension plans<lb/></head>

			<p>Multi-employer plans are financed by participating employers through contributions generally<lb/> specified in collective bargaining agreements. In this case, contributions are solely made by<lb/> employers and employees normally do not need to contribute. Employer contributions are a tax-<lb/>deductible business expense and do not create a taxable benefit-in-kind for the employees. These<lb/> contributions are typically based on the number of hours worked by each employee covered by<lb/> the plan. The employer contributions are typically fixed for the term of the collective arrangement<lb/> between management and unions. However, employers may be required to make more<lb/> contributions if the agreement specifies scheduled increases at pre-determined times, or terms<lb/> ensuring maintenance of employees&apos; benefit levels.<lb/> Therefore, in other words, the plan can give the appearance of being DC in terms of contributions<lb/> going in, but is clearly DB in terms of benefits being paid out. This dilemma can aggravate the<lb/> already complicated funding problems being experienced by multi-employer DB plans in the<lb/> United States. Another serious concern is the effect on the funded status of the DB plan of the<lb/> departure of one of the participating employers, whether voluntarily or through bankruptcy, since<lb/> contributions of the remaining employers must provide for the benefits of the employees of a<lb/> departing employer.<lb/></p>

			<p>An individual plan participant who terminates service with one employer covered by the plan and<lb/> joins another employer that also participates in the plan is not treated as a termination of<lb/> employment. Instead, the individual continues to accrue retirement benefits. This portability<lb/> feature makes multi-employer plans particularly attractive in such industries as construction,<lb/> where employees constantly move from one construction site to another, and from one employer<lb/> to another.<lb/> As noted earlier, the trustee structure features equal numbers of union and management<lb/> representatives sitting on the board. The trustees are the decision makers of the operation of the<lb/> fund, but they are not paid. The appointment and removal of trustees is normally specified in the<lb/> fund agreement. In this context, trade unions (representing employees) have the power to appoint<lb/> and remove the union trustees, while the employer associations (representing employers) have the<lb/> same power and function with regard to employer trustees.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 Simplified employee pension plans (SEPs) and SIMPLE IRAs<lb/></head>

			<p>In reality, SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs are simply a collection of Individual Retirement Accounts<lb/> (IRAs) that, in theory, anyone can buy on the street, or in other words, in the retail<lb/> market. Therefore, they are operated in a framework much different from the multi-employer<lb/> schemes as describe earlier. The operating structure is simple, in that there is only a single<lb/> provider, i.e. professional financial institution or trustee. The providers are banks, mutual funds,<lb/> insurance companies that issue annuity contracts and other eligible financial products, and they<lb/> often provide ―one-stop shopping‖, i.e. including asset management, trusteeship, etc., with the<lb/> participants responsible for investment among the choices and for benefit payment decisions<lb/> (including early withdrawal and lump sum payments).<lb/> Meanwhile, the above mentioned professional service providers are chosen by the plan sponsors,<lb/> and individual employees cannot choose different providers, although each employee ―owns‖ his<lb/> or her IRA within the plan. Similar to the master trusts in other countries, employers play a<lb/> ―paternalistic‖ role in this case.<lb/> Regarding the governance structure of the pension funds, such pension assets could be managed<lb/> either under trust or not. If under trust, there is no such requirement that employees and employers<lb/> should be represented on the board of trustees. Therefore, if employer sponsors and/or employees<lb/> are not satisfied with the professional trustee&apos;s performance, they may only consider replacing the<lb/> trustee.<lb/> It has been argued that administrative costs of the SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs are low, given the fact<lb/> that some regulatory requirements for standard occupational schemes are removed. For example,<lb/> they are not required to file annual financial reports with the federal government. Meanwhile, the<lb/> only real paper work between employers and the financial institution is a 2-page form, while all<lb/> the other paper work and record keeping is conducted by the latter.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Key characteristics<lb/> 4.1 Equal representation<lb/></head>

			<p>For the multi-employer funds in the US, it is required to have equal numbers of employee (trade<lb/> unions) and management (industry associations) representatives on the board of trustees.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Role of the private sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The private sector has been playing a very important role in the occupational pension markets in<lb/> general, and particularly the CPFs. For example, SMEs heavily rely on the private sector (e.g.<lb/> insurance companies) to establish occupational pension schemes for their employees.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Tax concessions<lb/></head>

			<p>The system of occupational pension plans in the United States rests squarely on a foundation of<lb/> tax considerations, and the tax advantages can be substantial for both employers and employees.<lb/> It can be said that most SMEs are driven by the tax incentives provided by the government that<lb/> encourage the establishment and maintenance of occupational pension plans.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Merits and weaknesses:<lb/> 5.1. Main merits<lb/></head>

			<p>First, the mechanism of equal representation of interests of employees and employers has been set<lb/> up in the US&apos;s multi-employer pension system, and it should protect interests of either party from<lb/> being exploited by the other party.<lb/> Second, as in other countries, extensive participation of the private sector in the system facilitates<lb/> SMEs to set up occupational pension plans, large due to economies of scale. Meanwhile,<lb/> beneficiaries could benefit from professional services provided by financial institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Main weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p>First, there is a potential risk of conflicts of interest in the existing pension system in the United<lb/> States. Currently the legislation does not require the presence of independent directors on the<lb/> board of trustees for the corporate trustee, as in Hong Kong, China, or the existence of policy<lb/> committees as in Australia. As a result, it may be difficult to align their commercial interests with<lb/> their fiduciary duties.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, there has been no evidence of conflicts of interest occurring in US<lb/> multiemployer plans since the enactment of reforms in 1974 that generally prohibited transactions<lb/> with parties related to the plan. Note that risks in US multiemployer plans involving levels of cost<lb/> should not arise for DC multiemployer plans.<lb/> Second, another point related to the above is the issue of cost. It is reported that some master<lb/> trusts (such as insurance carriers) charge high costs due to their for-profit purpose, albeit some of<lb/> the additional costs may be the result of greater investment choices and higher quality of service.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, there is some potential risk in the US retail plan market that individual participants will<lb/> ultimately fail to have adequate savings due to the control participants have over such plans,<lb/> including: decisions about how much to contribute out of their salary, investment choice decisions,<lb/> and benefit payment elections (early withdrawal, failure to annuitize, etc.).<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Challenges:<lb/></head>

			<p>For multi-employer funds, the current system largely relates to such workers who typically stay<lb/> over with the same employer. An important question is whether they should be open to the<lb/> general public. For master trusts, their transparency of operations and risks related to participant<lb/> control present challenges to be tackled.</p>
