Contact: fabienne.cerri@oecd.org ABSTRACT Entrepreneurship and firm creation have long been recognised as a vital force driving innovation. 
With globalization and the co-incident shift towards a knowledge-based economy, the link between 
entrepreneurship policy and innovation has received renewed attention. By underpinning firm creation 
and firm expansion entrepreneurship policies strengthen innovation, increasing productivity in the 
enterprise sector. In return, policies fostering innovation will tend to spur firm creation as the results of 
R&D are commercialized. Many countries have taken initiatives since early 2000 to test the potential of 
entrepreneurship and SME policies, articulating these with an innovation-oriented policy approach. 
This report consists of a synthesis report based on four country case studies on the role of 
entrepreneurship policies in supporting innovation in Korea, Mexico, Norway and Turkey. These 
country case studies are appended to the synthesis report. * External consultant to the OECD. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 4 PROMOUVOIR L'ENTREPRENEURIAT POUR SOUTENIR L'INNOVATION Axel Mittelstädt* et Fabienne Cerri

Contact : fabienne.cerri@oecd.org RESUME L'entrepreneuriat et les créations d'entreprises sont traditionnellement considérés comme l'un des 
principaux moteurs de l'innovation. Avec la mondialisation et la transition concomitante vers une 
économie du savoir, le lien entre les politiques de l'innovation et celles en faveur de l'entrepreneuriat 
revient sur le devant de la scène. En soutenant la création d'entreprises et leur expansion les politiques 
en faveur de l'entrepreneuriat renforcent l'innovation et la croissance de la productivité. 
Réciproquement, les politiques de soutien à l'innovation favorisent généralement la création 
d'entreprises, car les résultats des activités de R-D sont commercialisés. De nombreux pays ont engagé, 
dès le début des années 2000, un examen systématique des politiques en faveur de l'entrepreneuriat et 
des PME, en optant pour une approche axée sur l'innovation. Ce rapport consiste d'un rapport de 
synthèse basé sur quatre études de cas portant sur le rôle joué par les politiques en faveur de 
l'entrepreneuriat dans la promotion de l'innovation en Corée, au Mexique, en Norvège et en Turquie. 
Chacune de ces études de cas est annexée au rapport de synthèse. * Consultant externe auprès de l'OCDE. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The report was prepared by Axel Mittelstädt and Fabienne Cerri under the direction of

(KOREA, MEXICO, NORWAY AND TURKEY) Introduction Entrepreneurship and firm creation have long been recognised as vital forces driving innovation. 
Experience shows that interactions between innovation and entrepreneurship policies stimulate gains in 
productivity. 1 The link between entrepreneurship policy and innovation is, by nature, indirect and 
co-dependent. By underpinning firm creation and firm expansion entrepreneurship and SME policies 
will strengthen innovation, while policies fostering innovation will tend to spur firm creation, as the 
results of R&D are commercialised. With globalisation and the co-incident shift towards a knowledge-based economy, this link has 
come under renewed attention. Interest in entrepreneurship policy has flourished as a consequence, with 
many countries taking new initiatives to test its potential. 2 Aware of these potential benefits, in the early 
2000s many countries have undertaken a systematic review of entrepreneurship and SME policies, 
shifting towards an innovation-oriented programme approach. Among the countries moving in this 
direction were Korea, Mexico, Norway and Turkey. This synthesis report attempts to assess these 
countries' new policies from an international perspective, hopefully enriching the international debate 
about the co-dependence of entrepreneurial activity (firm creation and firm expansion) and innovation. This synthesis report consists of three parts. The first part highlights main features of the four 
countries' business sector and identifies principal impediments to entrepreneurial activity. The second 
part presents different policy approaches seeking to stimulate entrepreneurial and innovative activities. 
The third and final part evaluates entrepreneurship and SME policies in the light of national adjustment 
requirements and international best-practice experience. 1 OECD (2005), SME and Entrepreneurship Outlook and A.N. Hoffmann (2007), A General Framework for 
Entrepreneurship Policy Review. 2 Entrepreneurship policy is usually defined as aiming at the pre-start, start up and post-start up phase of the 
entrepreneurial process. Its primary aim is to boost innovation and productivity growth and to make 
entrepreneurship a viable option for professional development. This calls for a set of organic conditions 
favouring people's access to the nascent pre-start phase with consequent moves into the infancy and early 
stages of new firms. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 8 I. 
Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation 1. 
Main features of the enterprise sector Reflecting population size, the number of enterprises differs sharply across the four countries. 
Mexico with far the highest population has the highest number of firms in the formal economy (about 4 
million enterprises). At the other extreme is Norway with about 350 000 firms. Enterprise intensity 
(enterprise per capita) is strong for Norway and Korea, but low for Mexico and Turkey (Table 1). The 
difference, though, is mainly fictional as large numbers of Mexico's and Turkey's enterprises operate in 
the informal economy. Adjusting for this bias raises the 'enterprise intensity' of both Mexico and 
Turkey close to levels observed in Korea and Norway. On the other hand, Mexico and Turkey have by 
far the highest regional dispersion of per-capita GDP in the OECD area, calling for strong region-
oriented entrepreneurship and SME policies. Table 1. Broad indicators Korea

profile database Common to the four countries under review is a high degree of SME-predominance (less 
than 250 employees). 3 In each of the four countries, SMEs accounted for more than 99% of 
the total business population (total formal economy). While similar measures of 
preponderance are noted for manufacturing (Table 2), the structure of firm size is vastly 
different. Manufacturing micro firms (less than 10 employees) strongly dominate in Mexico 
and Turkey (exceeding 90% of manufacturing firms). This compares with a share of only 
50% for Korea and of 60% for Norway. Moreover, small firms (10-49 employees) display a 
much stronger presence in Korea (42% of SMEs) and Norway (nearly 30%) than in Mexico 
and Turkey (Table 2). Large firms are strongly represented in Norway and weakly so in 
Turkey. 3 Less than 300 employees for Korea (see country case study on Korea for more information). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 9 Table 2. Main features of the enterprise sector Korea

the output share by the respective firm population share. The implicit efficiency ratios 
(Table 3) show the customary positive correlation between firm size and efficiency levels 
(three tiers of efficiency). In the four countries under consideration, large manufacturing 
firms (representing around 1% of the firm population) produce between one-half and three-
quarters of manufacturing output, the highest output share being indicated for Mexico (74%) 
and the lowest for Norway (49%). In contrast, micro firms, though dominant in terms of firm population, account for only a 
small portion of manufacturing output ranging from 4% for Mexico to 7% for Norway. The 
implied efficiency ratio is particularly low for Mexico and Turkey. On the other hand, Mexico 
and Turkey's medium-sized firms (MSEs) in manufacturing concentrated in metropolitan areas 
record high efficiency ratios; this could be the sign of a successful integration of these 
companies into the global economy. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 10 Table 3. Efficiency ratio by size class (Manufacturing output share divided by enterprise population share) Korea

for Mexico and Turkey than for Korea and Norway. The highly polarised profile of productivity 
levels by size class is typical of countries with a large number of subsistence entrepreneurs and a 
corresponding lack of efficient growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity. For this mismatch to 
narrow, a 'bottom-up convergence' of productivity levels needs to take place, allowing Mexico and 
Turkey's small and micro firms to catch up with high-income countries. Business start ups (a proxy of entrepreneurial activity) tend to shift resources from inefficient to 
innovative firms enhancing gains in aggregate firm productivity. 4 The productivity effects are 
particularly strong in high-tech industries, where start ups are vibrant. For Norway, 
FORA indicators 5 show high business start-up rates for most categories of SMEs, backed by wide-
spread entrepreneurial education, high bankruptcy recovery rates and, more recently, by new 
legislation on the taxation of dividends (2006). Bankruptcy recovery rates are also high in Korea 
where unified bankruptcy laws and improved re-start possibilities contribute to rapid firm turn-over. 
Survival rates of newly created Mexican firms appear to have risen over the past few years. This 
could be a consequence of the more intensive use of business incubators. 2. Selected factors driving firm creation and expansion The concepts of entrepreneurship and firm creation are closely related. 6 New firms and 
associated innovations tend to spring up from the interplay of three principal factors: Opportunity, 
skills and resources. Opportunities are created by market conditions and expectations. Skills include 
the ability of entrepreneurs and their access to business advice, while resources comprise access to 
capital, R&D and technology. From the entrepreneur's perspective, these three factors drive firm 4 S. Scarpetta, P.Hemmings, T. Tressel and J. Woo (2002), "The Role of Policy and Institutions for 
Productivity and Firm Dynamics. Evidence from Micro and Industry Data", Working Paper No. 329, 
Internal Working Document, Economics Department, OECD, Paris. 5 FORA (2007), Quality Assessment of Entrepreneurship Indicators. 6 Innovation can be fuelled from external sources to the firm, but one should also take into account the 
internal sources (in-house), which are often a main source of innovation activity. Some aspects of 
entrepreneurship policies, such as building internal capability through skills development, is therefore a 
key resource for both new and existing enterprises. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 11 creation. 7 Even so, a hostile regulatory framework and adverse cultural attitudes may hinder firm 
creation. Market conditions and the regulatory framework are key determinants of entrepreneurship, but 
are not treated thoroughly in these case studies. This is the case for instance for bankruptcy 
legislation. The outline of the case studies is largely based upon major determinants of 
entrepreneurship excluding market conditions and the regulatory framework. These determinants of 
entrepreneurial activity can be seen as potential areas for entrepreneurship policy: @BULLET Resources: access to technology 8 and finance. @BULLET Skills: capabilities and access to skilled labour. @BULLET Cultural factors. @BULLET Opportunities (market conditions): not treated in the case studies. @BULLET Regulatory framework: not treated in the case studies. 9 a) 
Access to new technology, including ICT ICT plays a central role in the interplay between entrepreneurial policy and innovative activity. Wide 
ICT diffusion can ease the creation and expansion of business support centres ( " service stations " ). It 
facilitates network building, data collection and information exchange among service stations of the same 
kind as well as among different support units. The result is often a finessed, synergetic programme 
approach apt to respond more adequately to specific needs of different business categories. On the demand side, ICT raises the visibility of programme support stimulating their take-up, 
especially by small and micro firms. ICT thus improves supply as well as demand conditions for business 
support services and represents a major tool of entrepreneurship and SME policies. Within the business 
sector, ICT and e-business applications provide further benefits across a wide range of intra-and inter-firm 
processes and transactions, including the internationalisation of SME activities. 10 ICT also impacts directly upon two principal intervention areas of entrepreneurship and SME policies. 
In the financial sector, rising ICT diffusion enhances banks' credit assessment capacity and augments the 
transparency of data on firm performance and credit conditions. By kindling competition among financial 
institutions ICT helps ease barriers to finance, with a consequent fall in bank lending rates for SMEs 
relative to benchmark interest rates (interest rate convergence). In the domain of skilled labour, ICT and related basic training courses for would-be and actual 
entrepreneurs favours the absorption of non-R&D based innovations. In schools, universities and research 
centres, ICT is an indispensable tool for spreading the values of entrepreneurial education. Overall, ICT 
makes entrepreneurship and SME policies more effective, spurring both entrepreneurial activity and 
innovative momentum. 7 A.N. Hoffmann (2007), A General Framework for Entrepreneurship Policy Review. 8 The issue of access to technology is treated only to the extent that it affects entrepreneurial activity. 9 Some issues relating to the regulatory framework will be treated in this chapter only to the extent that they 
affect entrepreneurship directly. 10 OECD (2004),  " ICT, E-Business and SMEs " . 2 nd OECD Conference of Ministers Responsible for Small 
and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), Istanbul, June. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 12 ICT Diffusion Broadly in line with income levels, countries differ widely in the diffusion of information and 
communication technology and in R&D intensity. All indicators point to a weak ICT diffusion in Mexico 
and Turkey, representing fractional values of the OECD average (Figure 1). In both countries, 
exceptionally high prices for using ICT aggravate the effect from low income levels. Looking at individual 
ICT indicators, though, reveals some noteworthy differences. While Turkey has stronger fixed telephone 
access paths, cellular mobiles and broadband access than Mexico, the opposite is true of Internet 
subscribers to fixed networks. ICT diffusion also varies with the size of firms. In terms of Internet access, 
Turkey's large firms have recently reached parity with the European Union. Korea's diffusion of ICT 
surpasses OECD averages in all areas, signifying a strong ICT presence, especially considering its below-
average income position (80% of OECD per capita income). Norway's above-average performance is in 
tune with its high-income level. Figure 1. Diffusion of Information and Communication Technology per 100 inhabitants (2005) 41.7 79.4 25.3

This mainly reflects mismatches between industry needs and research routes followed by universities and 
public research institutions. Weak collaborative links between academia and the business sector seem to 
underlie this dichotomy. In Korea, only one tenth of public R&D funds is directly allocated to SMEs. High private R&D 
spending is strongly concentrated in large firms (nearly 80%) operating in two sectors (ICT and 
automobiles, nearly 50%). The resultant innovations are mostly product innovations 11 . Overall, judging by 
the low output of codified knowledge in the form of patents and publications, Korea may not enjoy the full 
benefits from sizeable R&D spending. In Turkey, the co-operation between academia, public institutions 
and industry is inadequate, notwithstanding a significant rise in the number of Turkish scientists' 
publications. Most Turkish R&D employees work for universities as distinct from research centres. In 11 OECD (2007), Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 13 Mexico, transmission links, though still insufficient, have recently improved with the strong build-up of 
business incubators and innovation laboratories. Both Korea and Norway display average degrees of SMEs collaborating in innovation activities 
(Figure 2). For both countries, OECD Scoreboard 2007data point to a scale of collaboration of only half of 
that recorded in Denmark and Sweden. Only a quarter of Norway's enterprises conducted innovation-
related activities in 2002-2004. Comparable data for Mexico and Turkey do not exist. Figure 2. SMEs collaborating in innovation activities (2002-2004) As a percentage of all firms 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 SMEs

Access to finance Bank credit and venture capital are important for firm creation and innovation. Barriers to finance 
affect disproportionally small and micro firms, often due to lack of collateral. 12 Bank lending rates thus 
tend to be high for small and micro firms. Start-ups of small innovative firms also confront difficulties in 
accessing risk capital. Mexico, Turkey, and to a lesser extent Korea and Norway, are no exception to this 
pattern. Largely in tune with their income position, efficiency levels of financial markets (as measured by net 
interest margins and total loans to private sector and securities market capitalisation in per cent of GDP) 
also vary strongly across countries. 13 Mexico and Turkey both combine extremely high net interest margins 
with extremely low loan/GDP ratios (Figure 3), pointing to difficult access to finance for smaller firms. In 
both countries, low ICT penetration reduces competitive pressure in banking services and may also impact 
the capacity of credit risk assessment, especially in the domain of small-scale lending. The opposite (lower 
margins and higher 'loan/GDP ratios') is noted for Korea and Norway. 12 OECD (2006), The SME Financing Gap. 13 OECD (2006), Going for Growth. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 14 Figure 3.

1990-1993 Source, OECD Going for Growth, 2006. High average interest rates imply high required rates of return on capital for firm creation and 
innovations. But, in addition, they imply a particularly wide dispersion of firm-size related lending rates 
around the high average (sharp asymmetry of effective lending rates). Comparative cost disadvantages for 
small and micro firms thus tend to be much larger in low-income countries than in high-income countries. 
In Mexico, for example, costly suppliers' credits account for as much as two-thirds of finance for small 
enterprises. In Turkey, only around 5% of available bank credit is provided to industrial SMEs, which 
account for no less than 99.5% of all industrial establishments. In both countries, a broad financial 
infrastructure for micro firms is inexistent. In contrast, EU-based SMEs meet about four-fifths of their 
financing needs through bank finance. Stringent collateral requirements are another source of financing difficulties. According to FORA data 
(2007), obtaining a bank loan without collateral is difficult in Korea, but easier in Norway. In Turkey, 
small firms view collateral requirements imposed by commercial banks as the most important barrier to DSTI/DOC(2008)5 15 finance, 14 far exceeding problems posed by high interest rates. In Mexico, banks' propensity to lend to 
SMEs has been damped, until recently, by inadequate rules for recovering guarantees. Business start-ups based upon innovations require special modes of finance. Loan originators, unable 
to discriminate between high and low-risk borrowers, often provide no funds for start-ups and young firms 
(credit rationing). In this setting, supplies of venture capital are essential for the birth and growth of ISMEs 
and HGSMEs. The government and financial institutions are the main suppliers of venture capital in 
Korea, business angels playing a minor role. Norway ranks moderately higher than Korea regarding 
venture capital flows in 2005 (Figure 4). For both countries, the greater part of venture capital investment 
is devoted to firm expansion. In Norway, the state and local institutions provide two-thirds of these funds, 
private investors the remainder. Mexico and Turkey, with no broadly based government support, have been 
plagued, until recently, by acute shortages of venture capital. Figure 4. Venture capital investment flows in percent of GDP (2006) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Seed/Start-up

Access to capabilities and to skilled labour Access to capabilities and skilled labour is strongly conditioned by income levels. Norway, a country 
with a high level of human capital (high levels of upper-secondary and tertiary education), stands out 
through its vibrant entrepreneurial culture and large-scale entrepreneurial education at school and 
university. Early-stage entrepreneurial activity is high and rising, with over 9% of the adult population 
(18-64 years) being involved in this activity (2006). Not surprisingly, GEM surveys credit Norway with a 14 Survey of Bankakaemie International, 2005. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 16 strong entrepreneurial culture. Female participation in early stage entrepreneurial activities, though, is still 
subdued. Korea, devoting the largest resources to education in terms of GDP among OECD countries, has 
strongly improved quality and quantity of human capital. While entrepreneurship education at school and 
university has been strengthened (since 2002), the eventual transition to entrepreneurial activity is subject 
to cultural constraints. In Mexico and Turkey, educational systems still underperform, despite recent progress in increasing 
access to school education. Opportunities for entrepreneurship education at school and university are 
sparse. In both countries, the absence of a large pool of skilled workers is a factor hampering innovative 
activities by small and micro firms. In Mexico, the coverage of educational services lag OECD averages, 
children spending comparatively few years in formal education. Entrepreneurial training for adults is low 
notwithstanding entrepreneurial aspirations. In Turkey, education opportunities are limited, creating a large 
supply of under-educated adults. In addition, cultural factors may hinder the inclination of certain groups, 
notably women, to opt for entrepreneurship as a professional career. II. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies 1. 
Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy Faced with growing challenges from globalisation and the related shift towards a knowledge-based 
economy many countries in the early 2000s altered the stance of entrepreneurship and SME policies. 15 
Stronger emphasis came to be placed upon innovation as a key agent driving firm productivity growth. 
Emerging as a major target variable of entrepreneurship and SME policies, innovation generally spans a 
wide range of different forms, including product, process, individual and collaborative innovations. Under 
the new policy approach, business start-ups and SMEs with a high growth potential (HGSMEs and ISMEs) 
as well as collaborative innovations have generally been singled out as priority areas. In varying degrees, Korea, Mexico, Norway and Turkey have all followed this trend. In each case, the 
year 2004 marked a turning point indicating either a shift towards or a transition to an innovation-focused 
entrepreneurship policy. A stronger international dimension, reflecting best-practice diffusion, often 
enriched the new policy approach. In 2004, Korea announced a plan to restructure its national innovation system. Mexico shifted its 
policy towards a comprehensive, innovation-based policy approach. Norway created Innovation Norway 
(2004) implementing part of the Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy (2003). At the same time, 
Norway designed a new strategy for entrepreneurship education (2004). Turkey began accession 
negotiations with the EU in 2004 which, three years later, gave rise to a new framework for 
entrepreneurship and SME policies. The 2007 Operational Programme for Regional Competitiveness 
(RCOP) has been prepared jointly by central and regional governments in collaboration with the EU 
Commission. 2. 
In search of collaborative innovation The reorientation of entrepreneurship and SME policies early 2000 was, in some instances, 
accompanied by significant 'institution-building'. Mexico created the SME Fund (FONDO PYME, 2004) 
within the Ministry of Economy, the government's main tool for shaping and implementing 
innovation-oriented policies. This was followed in 2007 by the creation of the Innovation Fund jointly run 
by the Ministry of Economy and the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT). 15 OECD (2004), Global Knowledge Flows and Economic Development. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 17 Norway merged four separate support institutions to create 'Innovation Norway' (2004), which 
became the government's main instrument to implement the innovation strategy (From Idea to Value, 
2003). Norway also established the Governmental Investment Fund (2007). Already endowed with a 
central agency in charge of entrepreneurship and SME polices, Turkey with KOSGEB (1990) and Korea 
with SMBA (1996) had no need for similar 'institution-building'. Turkey, though, widened KOSGEB's 
support approach (2007) which, in addition to industry, now includes tourism, information society, R&D 
and innovation in regions with a per capita income of less than 75% of the Turkish average. Viewing social capital as a vital innovation asset, all countries are increasingly engaged in the 
creation and expansion of a coherent infrastructure of public and private business 'service stations'. The 
collective efficiency strategy (collaborative innovation) is based upon the notion that a supportive 
environment for business activities greatly enhances the productivity of firms at all stages of development. In Mexico for example, the building of business 'service stations' was followed by the creation of 
networking links between same types of 'service stations' as well as between different categories of 
support units. In the period 2001-2007 Mexico developed networks between business development centers, 
business incubators, centers for productive articulation (CAPs), innovation laboratories and business 
accelerators. CAPs are mainly private micro or small business units acting as a hub for rendering high 
added value services to special branches of industry, commerce and services. Business accelerators help 
HGSMEs and ISMEs during their expansion phase. All four countries have used 'geographical proximity' as a means to reap higher dividends from 
research activity. Korea introduced the 'Innovative Cluster City Policy' (2005) aimed at integrating R&D 
infrastructures and generating networks between academia, research centers and industry. This policy also 
strives to transform seven key manufacturing complexes into more innovation-oriented regional hubs. 
Mexico's Programme for Strategic Projects aims to establish a homogenous infrastructure for business 
activities, presenting a platform for foreign investment. Mexico has also created industrial parks, 
productive chains, zones for eco-tourism and commercial centers as part of its Programme for Strategic 
Productive Projects (2001-2007). Norway has installed Research Parks and 'Business Gardens' (Business Development Centers) in 
remote, rural areas deprived of colleges or universities. Acting as networking hubs, Business Gardens 
function as a partner for firms, investors and researchers. Turkey has set up 'Synergy Focal Points' 
generalising services and assistance to SMEs. Under the new framework for entrepreneurship and SME 
policies (RCOP, 2007) Turkey has adopted a more focused 'growth-center approach'. Inside 
12 less-developed regions, 15 growth centers with a high growth potential have been identified. About 
14% of all Turkish firms are located in these regions. Network-building among firms Countries have also aimed at increasing horizontal and vertical networking within the business sector 
in order to enhance the collaboration between firms. Korea has set up a foundation (2006) fostering 
collaboration between large firms and SMEs via joint R&D efforts and human resource development. 
Mexico's National Programme of Suppliers' Development (SDP, 1995) has progressively led to voluntary, 
strategic alliances between large firms and SMEs. Another Mexican programme (Programme for Strategic 
Productive Projects) aims at attracting large firms, paving the way for micro firms to become part of 
groups of competitive, local suppliers. Mexico has also established a network of export centers allowing 
SMEs to sell products to large exporting firms. In Norway, SIVA, a state enterprise owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has played a key 
role in promoting strong regional and local industrial clusters. SIVA has upgraded the infrastructure for DSTI/DOC(2008)5 18 innovative business activities. Turkey has used an increased flow of advisory services from professional 
organisations and universities to create stronger links between large and smaller firms. Under the RCOP 
(2007), Turkey also strives to tighten such connections applying a 'growth center approach' to 12 
less-developed regions. RCOP also stimulates the formation of sectoral clustering and inter-regional 
network building in these regions. 3. 
Improving access to new technology and R&D benefits Creating and channeling new technology to all categories of firms figures high on the four countries' 
policy agenda. Initiatives taken in this domain fall into two categories, one striving to improve R&D 
benefits through stronger ties between academia, research centers and the business sector, the other 
enhancing SMEs' capacity to absorb new technology. In many instances, policy initiatives have used the 
advantage of geographical proximity, e.g. installing business incubators in universities. Improving links between academia, research centers and the business sector For many years, Korea has been concerned about its lack of overall R&D efficiency. To improve 
dividends from substantial R&D spending Korea has progressively stepped up efforts in this field. The 
Industry-University-Research Consortium Programme run by SMBA (1993) helped bring public research 
efforts more in line with the needs of the enterprise sector. Subsequently, both the Technology Transfer 
Promotion Act 2000 and the Transferred Technology Development Project (2003) strengthened the 
technology transfer from the public to the private sector. In addition, business incubators have been 
introduced in some universities and research institutes. Mexico has established rising numbers of innovation laboratories and business accelerators as a 
means to strengthen ties between research centers and mature SMEs and HGSMEs. In Norway, research 
parks and Technology Transfer Offices (TTO, 1993) have promoted the commercialisation of innovation. 
Both support entities are closely integrated in universities. The FORNY programme (2000) has fostered 
collaborative ties between the research community and the business sector. Turkey has set up Technology 
Development Centers (TEKMER), enterprise development centers (IGEM) as well as business incubators 
near or inside universities. Technical Development Zones (TDZ), concentrating on advanced technologies, 
also provide an infrastructure for generating and directing knowledge flows to near-by enterprises. Increasing SMEs' capacity to absorb new technology While better collaboration between research centers and firms tends to increase firms' ability to apply 
new technology, each country has taken additional supporting measures to spur firms' innovative 
momentum. Korea has built up a series of programmes over time, including the Technology Purchasing 
Insurance (mid-1990s), the Small Business Innovation Research Programme (KOSBIR, 1998), the Inno-
Biz Programme (2001), the SME Technology Innovation Programme (2001) and the SME IT 
implementation support programme. As part of these efforts, business incubators have been introduced in 
universities, while the use of ICT by small and micro firms has been promoted. To bridge the digitalisation 
gap between metropolitan and local areas, Korea has also conceived the Regional Cluster for Digitalisation 
Innovation programme. Mexico has strongly relied on innovation laboratories and business incubators to support firms' 
innovative initiatives. Three kinds of incubators prop up start-ups in traditional, intermediate-technology 
and high-technology sectors. Networks of business incubators (2003) and innovation laboratories (2005) 
have been set up. Moreover, the Programme for Innovation and Technological Development has promoted 
the transfer of technology from large to smaller firms in the automobile industry. This has led to the 
formation of clusters for robots and automation. Norway has also deployed business incubators, reserving a DSTI/DOC(2008)5 19 special type for heavy industry. In Turkey, TEKMERs and business incubators facilitate SMEs' use of new 
technology. TEKMERs teach entrepreneurs how to access support services. They also establish better 
relationships between SMEs and technology service providers, mostly public organisations. 4. 
Easing access to finance A wide range of instruments have been put into place to ease firms' access to credit and venture 
capital. In Korea, SMEs without collateral and technological know-how receive credit support through 
guarantee schemes operated by the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) and the Korea Technology 
Credit Guarantee Fund (KOTEC). The base for guarantees is backed up by financial government support to 
these organisations. In addition, eligible small firms in the start-up phase can obtain loans from the Small 
Business Corporation (SBC) at low interest rates. Mexico's National Guarantee System (2003) and the National Financial Extension Programme (2004) 
aim to enlarge credit supplies. A novel bidding process for guarantee funds has been set in motion (2005), 
kindling competition among financial intermediaries in search of loan guarantees. The National Financial 
Extension Programme, reaching nation-wide coverage in 2006, provides a financial assessment net helping 
firms enter into credit relationships. Improved credit applications are screened by a nation-wide web of 
commercial banks' branches. Norway's 'Innovation Norway Guarantee Scheme' targets SMEs with up to 100 employees. Because 
of stringent conditionality and low guarantee coverage, private banks rarely use this scheme. Most micro 
loans are available through the Cultura Bank offering credit guarantees with a better guarantee coverage in 
collaboration with the European Investment Fund. Funds are also available under grant schemes supporting 
projects for collaborative innovations. Turkey extends credit guarantees through the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF, 1994) and the Union of 
Turkish Artisans and Craftsmen Credit Cooperatives. Under the SME Finance Facility credits at low 
interest rates are given to SMEs located in less-developed regions. Under the SELP programme, small 
loans with a maturity of over a year are extended to SMEs. Aside from these measures, Turkey has 
extensively used investment allowances as a means to promote investment in fixed assets. The new SME 
Strategy and Action Plan (2007-2009), the first segment of the 9 th Development Plan (2007-2013), 
provides additional funds for micro loan mechanisms and related advisory services. Increasing the supply of venture capital Korea views venture capital markets as a primary source of finance for start-ups and high-growth 
businesses. Accordingly, the government has strongly backed the venture capital market by creating 
venture capital investment funds and setting up venture capital firms and venture capital partnerships. A 
'fund of funds' was established in 2004. Mexico, in an effort to increase supplies of venture capital for 
high-growth firms, introduced the Seed Capital Programme (2005), using partnerships and subsidised loans 
formulas. Prospective innovative entrepreneurs also benefit from similar support under the FORPRODE 
Programme. Through a unique investment guarantee (PYME Option), Mexico also promotes the creation 
of 'Investors Clubs'. These clubs seek a high return on capital through investment in innovative firms. Given small and fragmented capital markets, Norway has instaured mechanisms to provide risk 
capital investors with public co-investment schemes (Seed Capital Scheme and Argentum, 2001). A public 
investment fund was set up in 2007 to meet financial needs of potential high-growth firms. In Turkey, 
venture capital is mainly supplied by two venture capital investment trusts. KOBI, a public incorporated 
company, acts as a risk intermediary offering various financial instruments for ISMEs and HGSMEs. 
ISRISK, a private company, performs similar functions. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 20 5. 
Easing access to entrepreneurship education and training To different degrees, all countries have put stronger emphasis upon entrepreneurship education. 
Injecting entrepreneurial spirits into all levels of education and business stages came to be seen as an 
engine for future innovation. Korea views entrepreneurship training and education as a key element in 
promoting business start-ups. Entrepreneurship development programmes have been set up both at 
secondary and tertiary level (Biz-cool programme, 2003). 'Entrepreneur clubs' at universities develop a 
'start-up mindset' in students. Through a public education institute (1982), Korea has also upgraded the 
quality of the SME workforce. Three regional centers have been established recently, providing in-house 
training for ICT use. Mexico's network of Business Development Centers (BDCs, 2001), though not providing direct 
entrepreneurship training, offers concrete business solutions such as drawing up loan requests based upon 
the assessment by BDCs of financial needs. Conventional BDCs provide basic support services, especially 
to subsistence entrepreneurs. 'BDCs Plus' assist ISMEs and HGSMEs. Direct training for entrepreneurs, 
notably subsistence entrepreneurs, is extended under both the Programme for Training and Strengthening 
firms' Capabilities and the PROMODE Programme. Since 2005, training options have been differentiated 
to correspond to different innovation forms. Mexico's Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms' Capabilities offers three kinds of 
training: conventional training, specialised training for product and process innovations and training the 
'coaches'. Entrepreneurship receives nation-wide attention during the annual SME-week, a national event. 
Mobile information centers (SME policy vans) spread information about opportunities to benefit from 
government support. Regular business forums attract 'would-be' entrepreneurs. Norway launched a national strategy for entrepreneurship education in 2004. The strategy covers all 
stages of the educational system from primary school to college and university, and includes teacher 
training. Several universities provide both compulsory and voluntary courses on entrepreneurship, 
economics and technology. Revised in 2006 the strategy for entrepreneurship education now focuses on 
support to organisations and other stakeholders (municipalities and trade and industry associations) that 
normally promote entrepreneurship education. The government also supports 'Junior Achievement-Young 
Enterprise Norway' (JA-YE, 1997), Norway's largest private supplier of entrepreneurship training. The 
programme 'Introductory Enterprises', providing expert guidance, assists immigrants in developing 
entrepreneurial qualities. Turkey's KOSGEB, through its Enterprise Development Centers (BDC) and Technological 
Development Centers, operates several incentive and training programmes. KOSGEB's Center for 
Entrepreneurship disseminates information about potentially viable business opportunities. Market 
research findings are spread through the networks of IGEMs, TEKMERs and small industrial estates 
(SSIEs). Information about best practices is also released. For business start ups, KOSGEB has two 
training programmes, one supplying general educational services, the other offering specialised training 
given by professional (public or private) organisations. III. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation A successful entrepreneurship and SME policy evolves through time with the maturing of both 
innovative processes and supporting service units. Three policy phases are usefully distinguished, the first 
one spurring R&D and innovation so as to create vast segments of ISMES and HSMEs. During the second 
phase, the innovations are spread through improved scientific networks, specialised institutions and better DSTI/DOC(2008)5 21 access to venture capital. In the third and final phase, the innovative momentum gathers pace stimulated by 
learning effects and the transition to the knowledge economy. 16 Both Norway and Korea have, over the past few years, made significant progress in all three policy 
phases. This is evident in better co-ordinated R&D efforts, higher R&D spending (Korea), better 
opportunities for training and entrepreneurship education, stronger early stage and innovative activity, 
better networking facilities and rising ICT diffusion from high levels (Figure 1). For Mexico and Turkey, the evidence is mixed. In both countries, large industrial firms and MSEs, 
have made progress in the first two policy phases as outlined above. Novel and enlarged support services, 
rapidly rising ICT use along with stronger private R&D efforts have boosted large companies' and MSEs' 
capacity to compete internationally (stronger growth-oriented activity). The rising use of business 
incubators, innovation laboratories and geographical bundling of business support units (advantage of 
geographical proximity) has contributed to this outcome. At the same time, though, vast numbers of Mexico and Turkey's small and micro firms (large 
oversupply of subsistence entrepreneurship) lack access to technology, education, training and finance. 
Injecting a growth-oriented entrepreneurial spirit into these 'excluded' firms demands a broad, balanced 
policy approach. Better education on all levels, including entrepreneurship education for both men and 
women, and basic training courses will eventually raise the propensity for business start ups as well as 
micro firms' capacity to absorb ICT. This calls for non-R&D based and collaborative innovations making 
small and micro firms eligible for inclusion in producer networks. Countries need to test simple and cost-
efficient variants of these collaborative innovations like mobile business development centers and mobile 
banks, which have been successfully used elsewhere. Until recently, Mexico's and, especially, Turkey's entrepreneurship and SME policies appear to have 
been tilted towards backing HGSMEs and ISMEs rather than designing comprehensive support 
programmes for small and micro firms. Turkey's 2007 RCOP programme (2007-2013), though, is based on 
the principle of a 'bottom-up' convergence of firm productivity levels. Drawn up jointly with the EU 
commission, RCOP is scheduled to rebalance the policy approach. Both Mexico and Turkey show positive results for basic training courses (large participation, higher 
survival rates for micro firms), but they still lack appropriate nation-wide micro-finance mechanisms. This 
is especially the case for Turkey where small-loan activities are highly underdeveloped, where credit 
guarantee opportunities are sparse and where credit advisory services are limited. Many micro firms are 
thus compelled to rely on costly suppliers' credits or on informal money lenders (effective lending rates 
being a multiple of benchmark interest rates). Korea is also concerned about large gaps in efficiency levels between successful large firms and less 
effective SMEs. The duality in the firm population needs to be addressed by helping large manufacturing 
firms keep their competitive edge, while allowing smaller firms, notably in the service sector, to catch up. 
An efficient infrastructure of business services, providing differentiated support and training, would allow 
easier diffusion of knowledge in the lagging business segments. Private R&D spending, though high by 
international comparison, is extremely low in the service sector. Tapping this sector's large innovation 
potential calls for deeper and wider forms of collaborative innovations. Increased vertical network building 
between large firms and SMEs is one way of spreading chain-based innovations. 16 G. Rosenwurcel (2007), Political and Government Institute, UNSAM, Argentine (see: OECD (2007), 
SMEs in Mexico, p. 91). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 22 In Norway, the issue of a two-tier business sector is less apparent. Differences in inter-firm 
productivity levels are comparatively small, reflecting its high-income position and intensive, wide-spread 
entrepreneurship education. Nearly the totality of newly created micro firms, for example, has been shown 
to survive three-year periods. Even so, there is still room for progress which additional collaborative 
formulae are able to exploit. Summing up Income levels largely condition impediments to entrepreneurial and innovative activities. Mexico and 
Turkey are marked by a large oversupply of subsistence entrepreneurship, manifest in low efficiency ratios 
for small and micro firms, high shares of micro firms in the overall firm population and correspondingly 
low levels of aggregate firm productivity. Low R&D intensity and weak ICT penetration interact, damping 
innovative activity, maintaining uncompetitive behaviour in the banking sector, depressing advisory 
capacity for business services and keeping business activities from being internationalised. Retarding 
collaborative innovations low-ICT diffusion thus undercuts entrepreneurship and SME policies. There is a capital shortage in low-income countries reflected in both high real interest rates and a high 
dispersion of firm-size related lending rates around high interest rate averages. This hits small and micro 
firms more than proportionately, stifling innovative initiatives of potential and actual entrepreneurs. 
Underperforming educational systems coupled with a lack of entrepreneurship education and cultural 
biases perpetuate this web of impediments. For the higher-income countries, obstacles to entrepreneurial and innovative activities are less 
binding. However, Korea's sizeable R&D efforts do not seem to yield commensurate results in terms of 
innovations (lack of process innovations), while Norway's R&D intensity looks small relative to the 
income level. Collaborative innovations are suboptimal in both countries. Concluding remarks The country sample (four countries) is small, but rich in diversity. Two countries, Mexico and Turkey, 
are at the bottom of the OECD per-capita income ranking. Rapid population growth and low productivity 
gains, has, in both cases, damped income convergence (Figure 5). At the other end is Norway, enjoying an 
income level nearly 50% above the OECD average, and Korea, which stands out by its exceptional pace of 
real income convergence in recent years. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 23 Figure 5.

In spite of this diversity, entrepreneurship is an important policy concern to the four countries 
surveyed. They are all faced by the growing challenge of globalisation and the related shift towards a 
knowledge-based economy. They all aim to move up these emerging global value chains and they are all 
convinced of the potential of entrepreneurship policies to reinforce innovation policies and boost 
productivity growth. Accordingly, they have all implemented active policies towards increasing firms' 
access to new technologies, to finance and to capabilities and skills. These four country case studies are aimed at throwing some light on the main policy issues related to 
entrepreneurship policies. They are meant as a starting point for a more coherent effort by the Committee 
on Industry, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, together with its Working Party on SMEs and 
Entrepreneurship, to understand how entrepreneurship policies can help foster innovation. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 24 KOREA Introduction Korea's economic development has been marked by a rapid pace of convergence, per capita income 
having reached two-thirds of the OECD average. In this context, entrepreneurship and SME policies have 
been used extensively for over a decade to spur innovation and increase productivity in the enterprise 
sector. In a setting of rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences, supporting the creation of 
innovative enterprises was rightly seen as a policy priority. The link between entrepreneurial policy and innovation is by nature indirect. Efficient measures of 
entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation and expansion, and by doing so they strengthen innovative 
activity. Viewed from a wider angle, entrepreneurship policy itself may pave the way for  " collective 
process innovations " , augmenting the effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on 
individual innovations. The first part of this chapter highlights the main features of Korea's enterprise population, identifies 
main drivers of entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The 
second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes in four 
major areas of policy intervention: access to R&D and technology, access to finance, capabilities and 
access to skilled labour, and cultural values. The third part provides an evaluation of entrepreneurship 
policy. I. 
Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation 1. 
Main characteristics of the enterprise sector In 2006 there were an estimated 3 million businesses in Korea, employing around 12 million persons 
(Table 1.1). SMEs 17 with less than 300 employees accounted for over 99% of all firms and about 88% of 
total employment. Micro firms (0-9 employees) represented 88% of the enterprise population and 41% of 
the employment in 2006, while small firms (10-49 employees) accounted for 8% of the firm population 
and 21% of employment. In comparison, medium (50-299 employees) and large (over 300 employees) 
enterprises represented respectively 3% and less than 0.1% of the enterprise population and employed 
respectively about 25% and 12% of the total number of persons in 2006 (Figure 1.1). 17 The definition of business size can be different in some sectors. SMEs in Korea are defined in terms of 
employees and paid-in capital or revenue and vary depending on industry sectors. For more information on 
definitions, see Annex 1.A, Table 1 (Response of the Korean government to the 2008 OECD background 
report). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 25 Table 1.1 Distribution of Employment and Enterprises by firm size in Korea (2006) Size class

restaurants (20%), manufacturing (11%) and transportation (11%) (Table 1.2). However, based on 
employment, manufacturing is the predominant sector in Korea with 340 000 establishments employing 
27% of the total number of employees. This means that one enterprise employs an average of ten persons. 
It is also a sector where productivity is high. In contrast, the services sector suffers from high entry barriers 
and a low level of productivity (Figure 1.2). Labour productivity in Korea's services sector is only 56% of 
that of manufacturing and well below the OECD average. 18 18 OECD (2005), Economic Surveys Korea p. 32. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 26 Table 1.2 Distribution of enterprises and employees by sector (2006) Sector

Wholesale and retail trade Korea OECD average Per cent Source: OECD (2007), Economic Surveys Korea. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 27 Regarding output, manufacturing SMEs are responsible for over half of the manufacturing value 
added. They also have an important weight in exports: SMEs accounted for 42% of Korea's total exports in 
2002, this share falling to 32% in 2007. Most of SMEs' exports came from the manufacturing sector 
electronics and electrical components (28%), machinery (22%), textile (14%), chemical (15%), steel and 
metal (10%). Almost half of Korea's population and economic activity are concentrated in the capital region: Seoul, 
Incheon and Gyeonggi Province. This level of concentration is high compared to other OECD countries 
(Annex 1.A, Figure 1.A.1). After the Asian financial crisis in 1997 the number of large firms decreased significantly and so has 
the share of persons employed by large enterprises. The share of persons employed by SMEs has on the 
other hand increased (Table 1.3). Table 1.3 Change in employment As a percentage compared to the previous year 2001

performance. In contrast, SMEs which largely avoided restructuring have experienced a secular decline in 
their financial health and profitability. This is apparent in the rising difference in profit margins until 2004 
between SMEs and large enterprises (Table 1.4). This polarisation is also apparent in a higher debt to 
equity ratio for SMEs. In addition, there is a divergence within the SME sector itself with a significant 
share of very weak firms. 19 Table 1.4. Profit margins of large enterprises and SMEs Percentage of sales 2001

countries: in 2005, 52 587 new establishments were registered. While the creation of business start-ups in 
the manufacturing industry has slowed down, it has increased in the services industry. The number of firms 
going bankrupt has decreased in recent years, falling from 3 214 in 2003, to 2 200 in 2005. The number of businesses owned by women represented 37% of all businesses in 2005 (as against 
35% in 2000). These are mainly concentrated in the services industry (hotels and restaurants 35%, retail 
and wholesale 30%). 19 OECD (2005), Economic Surveys Korea p.36. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 28 Despite Korea's regulatory reform efforts since 1997, international indicators show that entry barriers 
are high. While the start-up time for a new business is reasonable in 2006, the number of procedures and 
the total cost for starting a business are higher than in most other high-income OECD countries according 
to World Bank evaluations. Bankruptcy laws have been amended to facilitate the exit and restructuring of firms. Several fast 
tracks and less costly bankruptcy processes have been introduced for small firms. The unified bankruptcy 
law, integrating three bankruptcy-related laws, has allowed firms to choose between several bankruptcy 
processes, lowering costs as a consequence. According to the 2005 OECD Survey  " Policy Questionnaire 
on Bankruptcy " , 20 possibilities for reorganising a company and chances of getting a fresh start in case of 
financial difficulties are just above average, compared to other OECD countries. FORA indicators 21 point 
to relatively high bankruptcy recovery rates in 2006, indicating that the investor's loss in case of business 
closure is relatively low. 2. 
Factors driving firm creation and expansion a) Access to new technology and R&D benefits Korea is the world leader in producing ICT goods, and the share of ICT value added in the business 
sector value added is amongst the highest in the OECD area. Its domestic diffusion of ICT is stronger than 
the OECD average (Table 1.5), especially considering its per capita income reaching two-thirds of the 
OECD average. While Korea performs well in terms of broadband infrastructure there is a large 
digitalisation gap between metropolitan areas and regions. Overall, investment in ICT equipment is lower 
than in many other OECD countries (Figure 1.3). This can be explained by the high share of small and 
micro firms in the firm population and their inherent difficulty in absorbing ICT, notably in the services 
sector. A recent survey conducted by the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) reveals that 
the informatisation level of SMEs in 2005 only ranked around 50 on a 0–100 scale. Many SMEs have 
neither fully integrated the advanced broadband environment and the necessary intra-firm organisational 
changes, nor inter-firm collaboration linked to the integration of ICT. This is due to lack of awareness, lack 
of skilled labour and lack of specialist services. In addition, a large number of SMEs are discouraged by 
medium to longer term costs of IT investment. Table 1.5 Diffusion of Information and Communication Technology 1 Mexico

2. Data for 2003 or latest year available. Source: OECD Scoreboard 2007. R&D spending in 2005 was equal to 3% of GDP compared to 2.3% in 1999. Expenditure is much 
higher than the 2.3% OECD average in 2005, Korea being ahead of the United States and just lagging 
behind Japan in terms of R&D intensity. This is also the case of business R&D spending which represented 
over 2% of industry value added in 1999, 3.2% in 2005, as against 2.2% for OECD countries. 22 However, 
according to a number of indicators, Korea may not be getting the full benefit from high government and 
business R&D spending. 23 The output of codified knowledge in the form of patents and publications as 
measured by the number of triadic patent families is weak. R&D expenditure is concentrated in a small number of firms and industries in manufacturing. About 
three-quarters of business-sector R&D is carried out in high and medium-high technology manufacturing 
industries; out of these three-quarters, 80% was concentrated in two sectors, ICT and automobile, one of 
the highest rates for OECD countries. Overall, Korea's business-sector R&D activities are concentrated in 
a relatively small number of larger firms. A recent survey of 12 000 firms with in-house research suggests 
that large enterprises accounted for 78% of business R&D expenditure (the top five firms 24 representing 
45%) in 2006. R&D expenditure in the services sector on the other hand is comparatively very low. In 
2001 and 2002 the proportion of service-sector enterprises engaged in innovation activity was 25%, well 
below the EU average of 40%. 25 22 OECD (2007), Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard. 23 OECD (2005), Economic Surveys Korea p. 32. 24 Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Hundai Motors, Hynix Semiconductors and GM Daewoo Auto and 
Technology. 25 OECD (2005), Economic Surveys Korea p. 99. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 30 The level of technology transfer from the public sector (universities and government research 
institutes) to the private sector is weak and insufficient. This is of concern as over half of the public R&D 
budget is channeled to public research institutes and one-quarter to universities, while only 10% of 
government R&D funds are directly allocated to SMEs. According to a recent survey from the Ministry of 
Commerce, Industry and Energy (2006), the technology transfer rate from the public sector and academia 
to the business sector was about 20% against respectively 28% and 41% for the United States and Canada. The innovation system is characterised by limited reliance of industry on public scientific research 
benefits and low responsiveness of public research efforts to business demands. In 2003, 97% of business-
financed R&D was performed by the business sector independently. In terms of innovative output, Korean 
firms rank rather high regarding product innovation 26 for large firms, just above average for SMEs. In 
contrast, both large firms and SMEs rank very low as regards the development of an in-house process 
innovation 27 (Annex 1.A, Figures 1.A.2 and 1.A.3). SMEs in Korea tend to collaborate less in innovation 
activities 28 than the average of OECD countries (Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4. Firms collaborating in innovation activities (2002-2004) As a percentage of all firms 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 SMEs

with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical 
specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional 
characteristics (Oslo Manual, 2005). 27 Process innovation is defined as the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or 
delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software (Oslo 
Manual, 2005). 28 Collaboration is defined as active participation in joint innovation projects with other organisations (Oslo 
Manual, 2005) but excludes pure contracting out of work. Collaboration can involve the joint development 
of new products, processes or other innovations with customers and suppliers, as well as horizontal work 
with other enterprises or public research bodies. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 31 b) Access to finance The ratio of credit to the private sector from financial institutions is below average compared to other 
OECD countries and obtaining a bank loan without collateral is difficult. 29 While loans to SMEs have risen 
continuously since the 1997 crisis (Figure 1.5) banks' decisions to lend to SMEs still rely heavily on real 
estate collateral or credit guarantees provided by the public sector. There is a reluctance to accept 
intangible assets such as innovative ideas, new technology or human capital. The minimum capital 
required for starting a business 30 is comparatively high, acting as a major deterrent to firm creation and 
expansion. Figure 1.5. Loans of banks to the private sector KRW trillion 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 2002

261 billion in 2004) while interest rates had reached 6.4% in 2006 (5.6% in 2004). Over seven years, real 
interest rates have decreased substantially (from 6.4% in 2000 to 4.2% in 2007 for short-term interest rates; 
from 7.7% in 2000 to 4.5% in 2007 for long-term interest rates). Even so, the level of interest rates has 
remained high relative to Korea's achievement in terms of per capita convergence. In 2007, Korea's real 
short-term and long-term interest rates still averaged 4.5%, a figure close to Mexican rates, Mexico being a 
country with a much lower per capita income (Table 1.6). In the Euro zone, real interest rates averaged 2%. 29 FORA indicators based on data from the World Economic Forum (Global Competitiveness Report

large companies and improving conditions for start-ups in knowledge-based industry. At the beginning of 
2000, Korea ranked among the leading OECD countries in venture capital investment as a share of GDP. 
After the crash of the KOSDAQ 31 in 2000, the number of venture capital firms and the number of funds 
declined significantly (Figure 1.6). This was also due in part to a tightened certification criterion 
introduced in 2002 32 after a number of firms had succeeded in being unjustifiably qualified. Venture capital 
is still provided by the government 33 (31% in 2004), banks, corporations and insurance companies, the 
roles of pension funds and business angels being relatively minor. Investor trust has been missing since the 
collapse of the venture capital market in 2000/2001 making it difficult for business start-ups to raise funds. Figure 1.6. Enterprises receiving venture capital KRW 100 million 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 2,000 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 1999

enterprises receiving venture capital, in order to facilitate the creation of small, high-technology firms. To 
be part of this category, an enterprise must meet one of three conditions (equity investment exceeding 10% 
of capital over six months, investment in research and development exceeding 5% of revenue, or sale of 
products incorporating patent rights) and be approved by an independent institution. 33 In other OECD countries, the role of government has gradually been phased-out. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 33 Venture capital investment per year -in particular early stage venture capital was amongst the highest 
in OECD countries in 2001, 34 but it has significantly decreased since. Entrepreneurs with innovative, but 
risky projects find it difficult to have access to venture capital (FORA, 2007). 35 c) Access to capabilities and to skilled labour Korea has achieved impressive results in terms of upgrading the level of human capital over the past 
20 years. While the percentage of the population with upper-secondary education is below average for the 
population aged 45-54, it is amongst the highest of all OECD countries for the population aged 25-34 
(Annex 1.A, Figure 1.A.4). Spending on education as a share of GDP is the highest in the OECD, 
reflecting a high investment in knowledge. Korea's focus on primary and secondary school education has 
contributed to the outstanding performance of its students by international standards. Korean fifteen-year 
olds have very high scores in the PISA 36 test (Annex 1.A, Figure 1.A.5), and a high number of students are 
pursuing scientific and technical courses. In tertiary education, however, there has been a decline in quality in the context of a sharp increase in 
quantity: about 50% of the population aged 25-34 has completed tertiary education in 2004 (Annex 1.A 
Figure 1.A.6), against less than 20% for the population aged 45-54 (the average for 19 European Union 
countries is 30%). The ratio of students to teaching staff has risen to a level well above the OECD average, 
while spending per student is about 15% of the OECD average. The related reliance on private outlays and 
the limited supply of student loans or grants has created concerns about the access of low-income 
households to higher education. A survey of business executives ranked the usefulness of Korea's 
university education 59 th out of 60 countries. 37 II. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies 1. 
Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy For about 40 years, SME policies have focused on protecting SMEs' business territory from large 
enterprises and ensuring SME stability. Since 2004, SME policies have become more market-oriented, 
pro-competitive and forward-looking, encouraging entrepreneurship and SME innovation. 38 Korea's SME 
policy priorities aim to create a positive environment for SMEs allowing any entrepreneur with creative 
ideas and dynamism to start a new enterprise as well as to increase SMEs' innovative capacity and global 
competitiveness. Differentiated policy programmes have been implemented depending on the type of SME 
(Box 1.1). The development of innovative SMEs has nonetheless been at the heart of SME policies and 
even economic policies as a whole. The creation of the KOSDAQ and the enactment of the law on special 
measures to promote venture business were designed to feed high-technology start-ups with funds. 34 OECD (2007), Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard. 35 FORA indicators based on data from the World Economic Forum (Global Competitiveness Report 
2006-2007). 36 PISA stands for Programme for International Student Assessment. 37 OECD (2005), Economic Surveys Korea p. 32. 38 OECD (2005), SME and Entrepreneurship Outlook. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 34 Box 1.1 Target groups in SME policies and programmes @BULLET  " Innovative and leading SMEs "  are those equipped with independent R&D and commercialisation abilities. They are estimated to represent about 10% of the total number of SMEs (micro-enterprises excluded). 
Programmes supporting this group focus on facilitating start-up, technology development and marketing in 
order to meet global standards. @BULLET Programmes for  " Self-reliant SMEs "  include revitalising their start-up activities and providing structural improvement. This also includes helping SMEs who lack competitiveness to operate a business switch. @BULLET  " Micro-enterprises "  refer to self-employed engaged in subsistence sectors (manufacturing, distribution, services). Various support programmes include start-up training and management innovation. SME policies and programmes have been modified annually in Korea, yielding a wide array of SME 
support measures (Annex 1.A, Table 1.A.2). In 2004, as much as 76 different programmes were supervised 
by 12 different ministries. Programmes are structured around four main policy areas: enhancing 
entrepreneurship and facilitating start-ups, easing access to finance and venture capital markets, promoting 
technology and increasing innovation capacity, and strengthening human capital. In recent years, two major plans have affected start-ups and SMEs (Box 1.2). In 2004 a 
comprehensive programme (Plan to restructure the national innovation system) was launched to 
restructure the national innovation system. It aimed to: provide effective tax incentives to the business 
sector to boost R&D; foster 10 000 innovation-driven SMEs through technical and financial assistance, 
subsidies for employing R&D personnel and easing regulation on start-up companies; create incentives at 
tertiary level and reform the primary and secondary school to secure future science and engineering 
students; strengthen technology diffusion; develop regional innovation clusters and foster Daedeok Science 
Town as a special R&D region; strengthen linkages between business, government and universities. In 2005, a government programme was adopted for small self-employed businesses and the services 
sector to restructure services, stabilise business activities of the small self-employed and upgrade 
competitiveness through franchising. Measures included: introducing/strengthening entry barriers in 
services, establishing regional consulting centers for the self-employed offering tailor-made consulting 
services and providing financial support to viable businesses via regional credit guarantee funds. Box 1.2. Calendar of major Entrepreneurship and SME Policy events 1996

field of entrepreneurship and SME policies (Figure 1.7); the administrator of SMBA is hierarchically at 
vice-minister level. Its mandate is to plan, implement and evaluate SME policies. A public agency, it 
reports to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE). SMBA has 6 offices at its 
headquarters and 11 regional offices. It employs a total of 630 persons. SMBA's budget amounted to 
KRW 2 trillion in 2006. The Small Business Corporation (SBC), which reports to SMBA, was set up in 1979 to implement 
and fund some of the SME programmes. SBC's budget was KRW 6.5 trillion for 2006 and the loans 
supplied to 9 000 SMEs amounted to KRW 2.1 trillion. Its 748 staff members provide consulting services 
to about 2 500 firms and train 67 000 persons every year. Two independent public guarantee institutions, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) and the 
Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund (KOTEC) provide credit guarantees to SMEs: @BULLET KCGF was established in 1976 under the provisions of the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund Act. 
Its mandate is to achieve a balanced development of the national economy by extending credit 
guarantees to enterprises lacking collateral. It also ensures sound credit transactions through 
efficient management of credit information. @BULLET KOTEC was founded in 1989 under the Financial Assistance to New Technology Business 
Act. TCGF provides credit guarantees to new technology based enterprises, to technologically 
strong SMEs and venture businesses. The myriad of programmes designed for SMEs in the past decade involved most ministries (Annex 
1.A, Table 1.A.2), creating problems of ministerial co-ordination. This has motivated the establishment in 
1998 of a Presidential Commission on Small and Medium Enterprise, simplifying and harmonising SME 
policies. The responsibility for entrepreneurship and SME programmes lies with three ministries: MOCIE, 
the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) and the Ministry of Labour. Figure 1.7. Major stakeholders of Entrepreneurship and SME policy MOCIE Presidential

Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovation activities a) 
Access to technology, R&D benefits and networking activities Developing SMEs' capacity in terms of technology and knowledge has been a key policy priority 
since 1998. The size of R&D funds available for SMEs has been rising continuously since 2001 – SMBA DSTI/DOC(2008)5 36 R&D funds represented USD 383 million in 2007 as against USD 139 million in 2001 (see Table 1.7 for 
the allocation of SMBA's R&D budget). Entrepreneurship and SME policies have mainly targeted the promotion of technology-based start-
ups. Programmes (Table 1.8) have consequently focused on four intervention areas: i) fostering innovative 
SMEs ii) facilitating commercialisation of R&D; iii) reinforcing networks between industry, academia and 
research institutes, but also between large enterprises and SMEs, iv) integrating SMEs in the digitalisation 
infrastructure. Table 1.7. Allocation of SMBA's R&D budget USD million Programmes

support the technological development of SMEs. Under this programme public institutes and central 
government agencies are to allocate 5% of their R&D budget to the technological development of SMEs. The Inno-Biz Programme was introduced in 2001 to better identify and foster innovative SMEs. Firms 
defined as innovative businesses are those which are equipped with superior technology and able to 
enhance their technological level through their own technological innovation system. The programme aims 
to help these SMEs grow and become well-established firms by providing them with technology 
guarantees and preferential treatment on credit loans. In 2006, around 7 000 SMEs were classified as 
 " Inno-Biz " . The SME Technology Innovation Programme introduced in 2001 funds SMEs capable of developing 
new technologies independently. These firms can recover 75% of their expenses linked to developing new 
products and enhancing product quality up to certain ceilings (USD 300 000 for two years in the case of 
strategic tasks; USD 100 000 for one year in the case of general tasks). Over 1 900 SMEs benefitted from 
the programme in 2005. To promote SME products with new technology, the government introduced Priority Purchasing of 
Technology Products in the mid-1990s. Development of new technology by SMEs was encouraged by 
making public institutions purchase SME products developed with new technology first. Since 2002 the 
government also introduced a purchasing insurance on new products developed by SMEs: public 
institutions and large enterprises commission SMEs to develop a new technology and commit to purchase 
new products over a certain period of time. Business Incubators (BIs) have been introduced in some universities and research institutes since 
1998 in order to increase the chances of survival of newly created firms, and to promote the expansion of 
newly created technology-oriented enterprises. In 2007, 269 BIs provided facilities and equipment to more 
than 5 000 companies over 3-5 years', 84% of these BIs being situated in universities. Services and support 
include amongst others the office or production space, expert consulting services, marketing training and 
connection to investors. Business incubators, who are overseen by SMBA were downsized for more 
efficiency between 2005 and 2007 and were scaled-down from over 300 to about 270. Facilitating technology transfer and commercialisation The government adopted the Technology Transfer Promotion Act in 2000 in order to promote 
technology transfer from the public to the private sector. The Korean Technology Transfer Centre (KTTC) 
was established to better assess the potential of technology, and develop its financial return, by helping 
SMEs to commercialise it. Under the Transferred Technology Development Project, SMBA covers 
additional development costs required to commercialise technologies owned by universities, research 
institutes and businesses. According to MOCIE, the technology transfer ratio from research institutes and 
universities has risen from 18.5% in 2004 to 20.7% in 2005. In 1998, the government introduced a three years leave of absence for professors and researchers in 
order to incite high-skilled individuals to start an innovative business (see Table 1.9 for the number of 
businesses created by professors and researchers). The 2007 amendment to the law of special measures to 
promote venture business has introduced further incentives for starting a businesses using new technology. 
It allows professors or researchers to make profit out of their technology and creates special areas within 
universities and research institutions with integrated entrepreneurship facilities. The option of a leave of 
absence for professors and researchers has been extended to six years and to all forms of business creation. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 38 Table 1.9. Businesses created by professors or researchers 1998

Technology Licensing Offices (TLO) -are also involved in the programme. In 2005, about 220 consortia 
were formed to support 2 700 SMEs in developing new technologies. A network of support for SMEs on intellectual property (IP) matters was established in 2000, 
involving the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the chambers of commerce, the government 
SME support agencies, local governments, the Korean Patent Attorneys Association (KPAA) and other 
private partners. It aims to help SMEs acquire IPRs, support commercialisation and reduce costs linked to 
the patenting of inventions. KIPO and KPAA signed a co-operation agreement whereby SMEs are 
provided with free patent management services for their first patent application. Encouraging networking The Innovative Cluster City Policy was introduced in 2005 as part of the comprehensive Plan for 
National Balanced Development (2005-2008). This policy aims to strengthen the industrial complex by 
integrating R&D infrastructures and developing networks between academia, research institutions and 
industry. It aims to transform seven key regional industrial complexes from manufacturing centers into 
more innovation-oriented regional hubs. As of 2007, 1 893 firms, 661 universities and research centers and 
303 supporting institutions were involved in the programme. To allow innovative SMEs to locate their buildings in areas where access to finance, transports, 
communications and research are high level, the government has provided incentives for private building 
companies to host innovative SMEs through exemptions from local taxes and expenses since 2001. In the 
context of the policy for a balanced regional development, a selection of areas were identified as  " venture 
promotion areas "  and innovative SMEs were incited to move from the metropolitan area to regional 
clusters. There are currently 25 priority areas, 8 are situated in the metropolitan region while 17 are 
dispersed in other regions. A total of USD 144 million were raised by the central government and the local 
governments (on a one-to-one basis) to allow the creation of favourable business conditions in these 
identified areas. This has included the creation of business support centers. Between 2002 and 2006, the 
concentration level of SMEs has increased from 17% to 22%; the average sales have risen by 56% while 
the average employment has increased by 30%. To address the rising bipolarisation between large companies and SMEs in terms of labour 
productivity, profits and wages, the Korean government has introduced a new framework to enhance 
co-operation. Under the 2006 Act on Promoting Cooperation between Large companies and SMEs 
MOCIE has set up a foundation in collaboration with business to execute policies. Enhanced cooperation 
takes the form of exchange of information, human resource development, joint efforts in R&D activities 
and fair treatment of SMEs. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 39 Enhancing access to information technology As small firms are relatively slow in adopting ICTs and new technologies, the Korean government has 
created programmes promoting ICT use by small and micro firms. These are run separately or jointly by 
MOCIE, MIC and SMBA. Programmes often target SMEs in the early stages of e-business adoption or 
those without e-business experience. @BULLET The Digital Innovation Consortium is run by the SMBA, regional universities, related agencies and 
consulting firms and assists SMEs in IT strategy, restructuring and in the use of appropriate 
software. @BULLET With the SME IT implementation support programme, the government provides 80% of the cost of 
professional consulting and the planning of IT implementation. Basic software, consulting services 
and training on the use of software are provided by the SBC and the Korean Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry. To bridge the digitalisation gap between metropolitan areas and local regions and to accelerate the 
digitalisation of SMEs in economically poor areas, the Regional Cluster for Digitalisation Innovation 
programme created in 2002 seeks to establish a broadband Internet infrastructure and an internal network 
to lay the foundation for digitalisation. The SMBA designated clusters in 8 regions in 2005 (budget 
USD 2.1 million). b) 
Better access to finance The government has provided direct and indirect financing support for SMEs which find it difficult to 
obtain a bank loan without collateral. Direct financing is provided by venture capital and the KOSDAQ 
market. Indirect financing services are provided through a guarantee system (security assurance service) 
for SMEs which are ineligible for bank loans, due to a lack of collateral and technology. Two organisations are involved in the credit guarantee schemes. SMEs can borrow funds from banks 
through the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) or the Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund 
(KOTEC). In 2006, KOTEC provided a total of KRW 931 billion worth of guarantees to 
7 314 beneficiaries and KRW 90 billion to 348 enterprises at incubation stage. KCGF had KRW 28 trillion 
worth of credit guarantees for the same year, the number of firm beneficiaries being 203 096. The base for 
guarantees is strengthened through financial government support to these organisations. The stock of 
guarantees represented 6% of GDP in 2004 and covered almost one-third of total lending to SMEs. On 
average, credit guarantees have an average duration of five years. Eligible small business owners, enterprises in the start-up phase, technology-oriented SMEs or SMEs 
awaiting reorganisation can also obtain loans from the SBC at a low interest rate. The total policy funds 
allocated in 2007 amounted to KRW 12 trillion (0.16% of GDP). In addition, Bank of Korea's regulation 
on loan operation of financial institutions calls for banks to allocate more than 60% of their loan increases 
to SMEs. Since 2004, an insurance programme, the Account Receivable Insurance Programme, has been 
set up to protect SMEs against failure to collect payment and risks of resulting bankruptcies. The Korean government puts strong emphasis upon venture capital markets as a primary source of 
funds for financing start-ups and high-growth businesses. To revitalise the supply of finance to SMEs, the 
government has supported the venture capital market by creating venture capital investment funds, setting 
up venture capital firms and venture capital partnerships. In 2006, the SMBA planned to create 
USD 500 million worth of venture investment funds, by setting up 102 venture capital firms and 
400 venture capital partnerships. A  " fund of funds "  amounting to USD 1 billion was also created by the DSTI/DOC(2008)5 40 government in 2004 to finance investment funds for venture businesses and therewith to meet long-term 
financing needs of the capital market. SMBA is also trying to revitalise the venture capital market by 
creating a USD 120 million active secondary fund aimed at buying the shares unlisted on KOSDAQ. Since 1998 the government introduced tax benefits (including income tax reductions) to induce 
individual investors to fund innovative SMEs. If an investment is made through a venture fund or through 
an association of individual investors, 10% of the amount invested (or 50% of the gross annual income) is 
deducted from the gross income if the investment is over a period of more than five years. If an investment 
is made in a company that was founded or transformed within the last three years, resulting capital gains 
are exempt from tax if the investment is over a period of five years. The Korea Business Angel Network 
(KBAN) provides support for venture investment. c) 
Better access to entrepreneurial education and training A key element in Korea's entrepreneurship and SME policies has been the promotion of business 
start-ups through: entrepreneurship training, enhancing entrepreneurial spirit and providing young, 
would-be entrepreneurs with assistance to succeed in starting their business. Both short-term and long-term entrepreneurship training programmes have been set up. Since 2004, 
five universities in Korea (notably Hoseo University and Jungang University) have launched a five-year 
pilot entrepreneurship programme,  " Entrepreneur Graduate Schools " , to train  " start-up specialists " . The 
education programme called  " Start-up Course "  created in 2002 on the other hand is a short-term training 
provided by local universities and specialised institutes. The course is designed to improve management 
skills of entrepreneurs and therewith to raise the start-up success rate. Around 100 courses are offered each 
year. In addition, a special  " Technology start-up programme "  was set up in universities in 2005 to target 
potential entrepreneurs with technological knowledge. It includes customised support programmes, 
training and network-building at the pre start-up stage. About 300 graduates benefit from the programme 
every year, 50% of them starting their business following the completion of the course. Entrepreneurship development programmes have been set up both at secondary and tertiary level to 
raise the entrepreneurial mindset in youth. The  " Biz-cool programme " , created in 2003 for teenagers, has 
been implemented in middle and high schools as a pilot project. By 2007, more than 150 000 students had 
benefitted from the programme (Table 1.10). The course includes financial education, self-management, 
business start-up and business administration and aims to develop students' business mentality and 
entrepreneurial spirit. It has also evolved from conventional lectures to practical courses involving visits to 
SMEs and start-up simulation. Table 1.10. Participants in the Bizcool programme Participants

training to favour a start-up mindset in students and to promote entrepreneurship. College students are DSTI/DOC(2008)5 41 trained as future entrepreneurs, enhancing creativity and frontier spirit. Currently more than 960 of these 
clubs exist in over 370 universities and have reached about 16 000 students. Efforts have also been made to upgrade the quality of the SME workforce. The first SME center, a 
public education institute, was set up in 1982 in Ansan City to improve the work skills of SME employees 
at an affordable cost. In addition, three regional centers were established recently. The centers provide 
about 800 different short-term in-house training programmes ranging from production technology, 
IT/automotion, quality assurance to digital technology. In 2007, 69 025 SME employees benefitted from 
this training. Finally, SMBA is supporting part of the expenses linked to consulting services provided to SMEs. 
Consulting firms need to register with SMBA to provide services including advice on business model, 
management and technology to start-ups lacking administrative skills and know-how. By 2007, 
176 consulting firms were collaborating with SMBA. Government funds allocated to this programme 
amounted to USD 2.9 million in 2007 compared to USD 1 million in 2002. III. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation Korea has placed entrepreneurship and SME policy at the core of governmental action for over a 
decade. A special institution responsible for small and medium enterprises (SMBA) was created in 1996 
and a Presidential Commission was set up in 1998, showing the determination to have a comprehensive, 
well-designed and well-coordinated policy approach. Although a myriad of programmes have been created 
for various SME categories, policy has mainly promoted innovative start-ups and supported industrial 
SMEs in upgrading their innovation potential. Entrepreneurship policy has rightly focused on facilitating access to finance both directly, through the 
creation of an extensive credit guarantee scheme, and indirectly, through the venture capital markets. Many 
programmes have also strengthened innovative activity, increasing ICT use by SMEs, facilitating the 
commercialisation of research, creating knowledge networks to unleash the innovation potential of SMEs. 
The introduction of entrepreneurial education at school and at universities in 2003 and the creation of 
business incubators at universities have strengthened innovation trends further. Initiatives over the past 
three years have increased networking opportunities and local knowledge diffusion. As a result, 
entrepreneurial activity in Korea has been dynamic with stable birth rates and declining death rates for 
firms. The average life of firms has thus lengthened. There is nonetheless room for using entrepreneurship and SME policy further to activate the potential 
of the innovation system. SME and entrepreneurship policies have been overly ambitious in attempting to 
address various needs of small business. This lack of policy focus has raised problems of overlapping and 
co-ordination between different ministries and government agencies. In addition, it has led to a lack of 
clear and overarching policy priorities helping SMEs to restructure and increase their competitiveness and 
innovation potential. Indicators point to a duality in the firm population, meaning that policies need to address both helping 
larger firms in the manufacturing sector keep their competitive edge, while allowing smaller firms, notably 
in the services sector, to catch up in terms of productivity rates. An efficient infrastructure of business 
services providing differentiated support and training would allow easier diffusion of knowledge in the 
business sector. Results on the output of codified knowledge show that Korea is far from receiving the full 
benefits from its high investment in R&D. This implies that there is large scope to improve networks 
between the different actors of the innovation framework. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 42 The need for stronger networks to spread knowledge and reap the benefits from R&D As reflected by the high level of R&D expenditure, innovation has been a strong policy priority in 
Korea for over a decade. Programmes have focused on supporting innovative start-ups and upgrading the 
innovation potential of existing SMEs. The Technology Transfer Promotion Act was adopted in 2000 to 
increase the commercialisation potential of research. The Inno-Biz Programme and the SME Technology 
Innovation Programme were introduced in 2001. The 2002 Digital Innovation Consortium and the SME IT 
implementation programmes aimed to improve use of ICT by small enterprises. More recent policy 
initiatives have strengthened networking activities, through an increased information exchange between 
business and research sectors, between large and small enterprises (2006 Act on Promoting Cooperation 
between Large companies and SMEs), through the creation of regional clusters (2005 Innovative Cluster 
City Policy). A number of indicators, however, suggest that Korea is not reeping the full benefits from the 
continuous increase in government and business R&D expenditure. Expenditure is concentrated on a 
limited number of firms in the manufacturing sector and outcomes of research are more geared towards 
product than process innovations. This raises concerns as Korea approaches the technology frontiers in 
different areas and firms need to develop their own technological capabilities. The innovation potential of 
the services sector is largely untapped – in 2001 the services sector accounted for only 13% of business 
R&D – and productivity in this sector is unusually low. Korea's innovation system would greatly benefit from collaborative (collective process) innovations 
taking the form of deeper and wider networking among academia, research centers, business development 
centers and the business sector. The current insufficient co-operation between the business sector and 
universities or government research institutes means that there is little entrepreneurial attempt to 
commercialise the findings of public research and that the technology transfer from the public to the 
private sector is low. This also acts as a barrier to the mobility of researchers who are deterred from 
entering business laboratories. Making potential entrepreneurs aware of support options and helping them 
to apply for assistance or make the most of credit funds could ease barriers to firm creation. Concentrating 
efforts on building an infrastructure disseminating the findings of research and providing subsequent 
business advice would thus be a major step in augmenting Korea's collaborative innovation potential. Stimulating growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity also involves increasing vertical network-
building between SMEs and large enterprises to spread chain-based innovations. Korea could build further 
on the co-operation between SMEs and large enterprises with well-designed vertical suppliers' 
development programmes integrating SMEs in vertical supply chains. Such links in services would notably 
allow raising productivity levels in this sector and reversing the rising bipolarity between small and large 
enterprises. In order to spread scientific and technological knowledge, enhanced horizontal collaboration between 
SMEs in the same sector could be further strengthened by using best practice and building on clustering 
activities. This would also involve building an efficient infrastructure of differentiated business services 
managed by public or private institutions. Changing cultural attitudes towards entrepreneurship through education and training Entrepreneurial education for aspiring entrepreneurs and basic entrepreneurial training courses for 
actual entrepreneurs are known to be highly efficient in overcoming psychological barriers to firm creation 
and in removing inefficiencies in the production process. Entrepreneurship education has received 
increasing attention since 2003 with the creation of the Biz-cool programme for secondary and tertiary 
level and the launching of two-year pilot entrepreneurship programmes at universities (Entrepreneur DSTI/DOC(2008)5 43 Graduate Schools). Short-term training is also provided by universities or specialised institutes to improve 
management skills of entrepreneurs. Although significant progress has been made in the domain of education and training in half a decade, 
there is still room for improvement. Cultural values are traditionally rather reticent towards firm creation. 
Starting a business has been and is still perceived as a difficult and risky project. In addition, the success 
rate of businesses created by highly skilled entrepreneurs such as researchers and professors has not been 
as high as expected, acting as a deterrent for well-educated individuals to start their own business. To reverse this trend and attract potential entrepreneurs into self-employment a better support 
infrastructure is needed (business incubators, business development centers, expert consulting services) in 
order to encourage firm creation and reduce the risk of failure. Surveys 39 show that the image of small 
business in Korean society is still relatively low management instability, poor working environment and 
low competitiveness. This calls for increased entrepreneurship education opportunities for younger 
generations to change public knowledge and social perception of entrepreneurial activities. In addition, there is a need to invest more in human capital at the tertiary education level to succeed in 
the educational domain and ensure an adequate supply of high-skilled human capital, strengthening 
innovation trends. Educational opportunities should also be extended to all segments of the firm population 
through differentiated training opportunities in order to help inefficient micro firms raise their productivity 
level. Improved financial infrastructure Korea has set up a comprehensive financial system to support start-up businesses and SMEs through a 
strong national credit guarantee system and a relatively high level of early stage venture capital. Yet, it is 
still difficult for entrepreneurs to obtain a bank loan without collateral, real interest rates still remain 
relatively high and international indicators (FORA, 2007) suggest that it is comparatively difficult for 
entrepreneurs to raise funds for risky projects. The credit guarantee scheme has facilitated access to finance for a high number of beneficiaries. 
However, insufficient analysis of credit risks has allowed a number of SMEs recording losses to survive 
and the extension of the term of credit guarantees has delayed the restructuring of the small enterprise 
sector, eroding the competitiveness and independence of SMEs. This aid needs to be reduced by rescaling 
credit guarantees through the introduction of a better credit rating system and increased expertise in 
assessing loan applications from firms that have no or little collateral. This would improve the selection of 
beneficiaries and shorten the duration of the credit schemes. With the 1997  " Act on Special Measures for the Promotion of Venture Businesses "  the government 
has aimed to develop the venture business sector to shift the weight of the economy to start-ups in 
knowledge-based industries. The government jump-started the venture capital market by providing equity 
capital from the public sector, generous tax incentives for venture capitalists and equity guarantees. 
Venture capital investments were centered on firms certified by government and receiving a number of 
benefits (reduced minimum capital requirement, tax exemptions, loans for start-ups, credit guarantees 
relaxed listing for KOSDAQ). So far, the role played by individual investors (business angels) and pension funds has been limited as 
the capital market is still relying heavily on the injection of government funds. To create a well-functioning 
financial system, the role played by the government needs to be gradually phased-out. The private sector's 39 Survey undertaken by SBC in 2003 on the perceived role of SMEs in the economy. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 44 role in venture funding on the other hand should be increased. Leveraging and diversifying private sources 
of venture capital would allow moving small firms away from the dependence on public debt guarantees 
and public funding. Concluding remarks Many steps have been taken to lift impediments to the creation and expansion of innovative firms. 
Korea has also been active in the area of education and training, as entrepreneurship has been introduced in 
the curricula to improve skills of actual and potential entrepreneurs. The need for a focused, balanced and 
well-coordinated entrepreneurship and SME strategy nonetheless remains. There are signs that Korea may not be benefitting from the high level of public and private R&D 
investment due to insufficient collective process innovations. To release the innovative capacity of the 
system and facilitate the emergence of innovative start-ups, policy would need to focus on network 
building, improving scientific-technological networks and facilitating the creation of vertical and 
horizontal links between enterprises. This can be achieved through broadened support programmes 
(including the non-industrial sector) and an extended range of differentiated business support services, 
reducing the productivity gap between services and manufacturing sectors, between small and large 
enterprises. Despite efforts to ease access to finance for small enterprises and start-ups through extensive credit 
guarantee scheme and the regular injection of government funds into the venture capital market, there are 
still major impediments to firm creation in this area of policy intervention. It is difficult for entrepreneurs 
to access collateral-free funds, and real interest rates remain high relative to Korea's achievement in terms 
of per capita convergence. Finally, success in the entrepreneurial domain will only be ensured if Korea invests further in 
entrepreneurial education and training to reverse psychological barriers to firm creation. This calls for 
increased entrepreneurship education opportunities for younger generations based on best practice. These 
need to be complemented by easing entry barriers for start-ups and extending business support services to 
reduce the risk of failure when starting a business. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 45 Box 1.3. Policy recommendations Improve programmes and policy co-ordination Streamline and reduce the number of programmes to assist SMEs

DSTI/DOC(2008)5 53 MEXICO Introduction Over the past few years, Mexico has placed rising emphasis on entrepreneurship policy as a principal 
means of stimulating innovation. Ongoing globalisation and the associated shift to a knowledge-based 
economy have revived worldwide interest in firm creation as a major agent of innovation. Entrepreneurship 
policy affects the whole range of entrepreneurial activities, including the pre-start, start up and post-start up 
phases of enterprise life. 40 The link between entrepreneurial policy and innovation is, by nature, indirect. Efficient measures of 
entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation and growth. In doing so, they strengthen innovative 
activity. Policy lead times, though, vary with the type of entrepreneurship policy. For instance, introducing 
entrepreneurship education in schools and universities is bound to affect innovation trends only in the 
longer run. The same is true of reducing cultural biases against entrepreneurial activities. In contrast, more 
immediate effects may spring from dismantling barriers to finance as well as setting up well-focused 
training courses for both subsistence entrepreneurs and business counsellors (teachers training 
programmes). Viewed from a wider angle, the design of entrepreneurship policy itself may constitute an 
'innovation', augmenting the effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on individual 
innovations. Mexico, as will be shown in this chapter, exemplifies this approach, using policy-induced 
collective process innovation as a main vehicle for stimulating individual product, process and market 
innovation. The first part of this chapter highlights salient features of Mexico's enterprise population, identifies 
main obstacles to entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The 
second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes, in 
four major areas of policy intervention: access to R&D and technology, access to finance, capabilities and 
access to skilled labour, and cultural values. The third part provides an evaluation of entrepreneurship 
policy. I. 
Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation Mexico's enterprise population is highly polarised, myriads of inefficient micro firms (abundance of 
subsistence entrepreneurs) co-existing with few efficient small, medium-sized and larger firms (growth-
oriented entrepreneurs). There are around 6 700 large and medium-sized enterprises and nearly 4 million 
micro firms in the formal economy, most of which are unprofitable. The informal economy includes about 
the same number of micro firms. Suffering from under endowment of tangible and intangible capital, overstaffing and consequent 
negative levels of total factor productivity, micro firms account for much of Mexico's overall productivity 
weakness. Notwithstanding macroeconomic stability, aggregate productivity has risen more slowly over 40 OECD (2005), SME and Entrepreneurship Outlook. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 54 the ten years to 2005 than in any other OECD country. For a country with a low per capita income and 
correspondingly large catching-up opportunities, this outcome is paradoxical (Annex 2.A, Figure 2.A.1). 1. 
Main characteristics of the enterprise sector The Mexican enterprise sector is characterised by the disparity between the competitive and export-
oriented 6 700 large and medium-sized enterprises and the often unprofitable and inefficient 4 million 
micro firms. 41 The diversity of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) population is reflected in the 
regional disparities in terms of social and economic development. For each of the three major economic 
sectors – manufacturing, retail and services – the regional pattern shows a particularly dominant presence 
of micro-firms in the South-eastern regions. By contrast, large and medium-sized firms display a relatively 
strong presence in the more prosperous Northern regions. 42 The regional distribution of GDP per capita in 
Mexico is amongst the least equal compared to other OECD countries (Figure 2.1). Benefits of Mexico's 
increasing integration into the global economy have been unevenly distributed with some states being 
better placed than others for reaping the fruits of better access to international markets. Figure 2.1. Regional dispersion in GDP per capita in OECD countries (Index of Gini 2001) 0.00

enterprises generating 52% of the GDP in 2006 and representing nearly three quarters of total employment. 
Most SMEs are micro-firms, this degree of predominance exceeds that observed in most other OECD 
countries (Figures 2.2 and 2.3). This is also reflected by the high level of self-employment in comparison 
to most other OECD countries (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.2. Percentage of enterprises by size class in the manufacturing sector (2003) Note: For the United States, size classes are: 1-9, 10-99, 100-499 and 500+. For all countries but Mexico, size classes 10-19 and 20-

number of small enterprises (139 000) and medium-sized firms (32 000) are fractions of the SME 
population, they account for one third of total employment (Figure 2.5). Figure 2.5. Distribution of Employment and Enterprises by Firm Size in Mexico (2003) Note: Micro=0-10 employees; Small=11-50 employees in manufacturing and services and up to 30 employees in retail;

and productivity levels. The typical firm is small and mostly family owned and run. About nine tenth are 
located in retail, services and agriculture and their output is oriented towards local markets. Only a small 
share of micro-firms are located in manufacturing (just over 300 000); they are on the other hand very 
present in retail trade (Table 2.1). In contrast, a small segment of internationally competitive firms that are 
mainly situated in the metropolitan areas of Mexico and Monterrey are endowed with modern equipment 
and with a strong culture of innovation. The average survival time of newly created firms is short, a substantial portion of them closing down 
before two years after birth. Many firms are unable to generate profits reflecting negative levels of total 
factor productivity. Unaware of available government support, they do not participate in  " association 
networks "  and continue to suffer from low levels of human capital, limited access to finance and 
inadequate use of technology. Their contribution to the total output is weak. Finally, a significant portion of Mexico's working force is active in the informal economy. 
Employment in the informal sector was estimated at 10.5 million people in 2002, representing about one 
quarter of the whole labour force. 43 Table 2.1. SMEs by Sector (2005) Percentage of Enterprises Sector

Factors driving firm creation and expansion A web of chronic impediments stifle firm creation, including lack of R&D benefits, lack of finance, 
shortage of skilled labour, high-quality education, training and business services. These obstacles are 
particularly strong for small and micro firms weighed down by under equipment of tangible and intangible 
capital. 43 The statistical office INEGI has started to produce a defined measure of the informal sector which 
considers employment and output of « non-structured » sectors such as street vendors and or 
micro-enterprises. See OECD (2007), SMEs in Mexico, Paris. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 58 a) 
Access to new technology and R&D Mexico's technological gap (as measured by the diffusion of information and communication 
technology, ICTs) is sizeable, even considering its position as a low per-capita income country (Table 2.2). 
In 2003, Mexico significantly lagged behind Turkey (a country with a comparably low per capita income) 
in terms of standard access lines, access channels and mobile subscribers. While prices are high compared 
to other OECD countries (Annex 2.A, Figures 2.A.2 and 3) the technological gap mainly reflects low 
awareness of ICT presenting profitable business opportunities. Moreover, inadequate R&D efforts account 
for weak trends in product and process innovation. R&D expenditure, though rising from 0.3% in 2001 to 
0.5% of GDP in 2005, is still low by international standards (the OECD average being 2.2% in 2005). 
R&D weakness is notably pronounced in the domain of private business: private R&D spending accounts 
for only one-third of Mexico's total R&D expenditure, the corresponding ratio for the OECD being 
roughly twice as large. Overall, private R&D spending amounted to 0.2% of GDP in 2005 as against 1.5% 
for the OECD area. Table 2.2. Diffusion of Information and Communication Technology 1 Mexico

Access to finance Access to business finance has been difficult. In 1996-2003, Mexico's bank overhead costs and net 
interest margins were, on average, among the highest in the OECD area (Annex 2.A, Figures 2.A.4 and 5), 
a sign of ingrained banking inefficiency. While both nominal and real interest rates have fallen since 2000 
they have stayed well above US levels (Table 2.3). In 2007, the real short-term interest rate was still twice 
as high as the US equivalent, pointing to a capital shortage characteristic of a low-per capita income 
country. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 59 Table 2.3. Nominal and real short-term interest rates 2001

2.6 1 . Nominal interest rate deflated by GDP deflator. Notwithstanding progress, lack of financing at a reasonable cost has kept on undermining 
entrepreneurial activity. While the growth of direct bank credit to enterprises rebounded strongly in 
2004-2005, 44 it became subsequently unstable (Figure 2.6). Overall, bank lending to the private sector 
(including mortgage and consumer credit) has remained among the lowest in the OECD area. Figure 2.6. Trends in Domestic Credit to the Private Sector Year-on-year percentage change in real terms 1 . Direct credit by commercial banks. Source: OECD, SMEs in Mexico, 2007. Data is from the Bank of Mexico. Inside the business sector, financing is marked by sharp asymmetries between large and small 
companies. Small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing the greatest difficulties in accessing bank 44 After the crisis in 1995 bank profitability recovered in Mexico and non-performing loans declined. Growth 
in domestic credit to the private sector was however slow to recover: bank credit to the private sector 
exhibited negative real annual growth throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s except for a brief 
period in 1998. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 60 financing given their higher risk and lack of access to foreign borrowing. While larger companies in 
tradable sectors have access to bank credit, SMEs rely mainly on costly suppliers' credit. 45 This has 
adverse effects on investment and innovation activities. In 2005, suppliers' credit accounted for two-thirds 
of finance for small enterprises (Table 2.4). In comparison, banks are in nearly 80% of cases the main 
source of financing for EU-based SMEs. 46 The supply of bank credit to the business sector has been further limited due to the longstanding lack 
of adequate rules for recovering guarantees and to the uncertainties about the application of the new legal 
framework following the 2003 reform. 47 Shortcomings in the application of the bankruptcy and credit 
guarantee law and in credit assessment affect smaller firms more acutely than larger firms, creating 
important asymmetries. Table 2.4. Sources of Enterprise Finance in Mexico (2005) (in percentage) Source of Finance

Access to capabilities and to skilled labour Human capital is still the lowest in the OECD due to a grossly underperforming educational system. 
Over the past decades, Mexico has made major progress in increasing school enrolment. While the volume 
of educational services has increased, there are doubts about whether the additional funding is delivering 
expected results. Both the quality and coverage of educational services remain far behind OECD best 
practices. Mexican children still spend comparatively few years in formal education and do not benefit 
from it as much as they should. Many children, especially the poor ones, still leave school before 
completing compulsory education. Literacy and numerical skills of students are by far the lowest of all 
OECD countries (Annex 2.A, Figure 2.A.6 on average PISA 48 scores in reading, mathematics and science). 
More so than in other OECD countries, the poor educational attainment of the working-age population is 
reproduced from one generation to the next (Annex 2.A, Figures 2.A.7 and 8). The transition between school and work also presents some major weaknesses with students being 
unable to find jobs matching their skills. Reforms were launched in 2004 to better match the curricula of 
the various systems of professional schooling with the needs of the productive sector. OECD experience 
shows that close connections between professional schools and the business sector are appropriate. 45 Bonturi, M. (2002),  " Challenges in the Mexican Financial Sector " , OECD Economics Department Working 
Papers No. 339, Paris. 46 OECD (2007), The SME financing gap. 47 OECD (2004), OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform: Mexico, Progress in implementing regulatory 
reform. 48 PISA stands for Programme for International Student Assessment. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 61 In addition, Mexico like several other OECD countries has a low training culture for adults with only 
a small share of employees (often the most qualified workers and employees of larger firms) being 
involved in training programmes. While cultural perceptions about entrepreneurial activity are generally 
positive, opportunities for entrepreneurship education continue to be sparse. In firms, the lack of innovative 
momentum often reflects  " old style "  management preventing both the hiring of highly qualified managers 
and purchases of sophisticated business services. II. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies 1. 
Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy Entrepreneurship policy makers have been facing the complex task of lifting a highly fragile and 
heterogenous firm population out of structural weakness. Adopting a strong and flexible policy approach, 
Mexico designed a new policy framework in 2000 aimed at making enterprises more efficient. The 2000 
Entrepreneurial Development Plan (EDP), created within the National Development Programme (NDP) 
(2001-06), served as a central axis for the government's new economic policy (Box 2.1). Box 2.1. Calendar of Major Entrepreneurship and SME Policy Events 2000

Creation of Technology Innovation Fund The EDP called on stakeholders of entrepreneurship policy (Federal, State, local governments, private 
sector associations and research communities) to co-operate and develop joint strategies to strengthen the 
business sector. With this aim in mind, the federal government progressively put into place mechanisms 
apt to improve participatory processes and vertical and horizontal policy co-ordination. In the process, 
administrative powers were decentralised, creating room for state and local governments and 
intermediaries to shape and implement entrepreneurship projects. Policy emphasis was initially placed upon lessening severe financial constraints hindering firm 
creation and firm expansion. Micro finance was seen as a key route to supplying funds to firms which 
normally have no access to traditional banking (subsistence entrepreneurs). Subsequently, though, (2004), 
the focus of entrepreneurship policy was shifted towards innovation. Innovation became the central policy 
axis permeating each policy category and releasing various externalities through cross-fertilisation. The 
new, incoming government (December 2006) further reinforced the innovation-oriented stance of 
entrepreneurship and SME policies, establishing in 2007 the Fund for Technological Innovation (Fondo de 
Innovacion Technologica). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 62 Building on concepts and recommendations from the Oslo Manual (OECD, 1999) and current 
innovation theory, the 2004 strategy of entrepreneurship encouragement identifies five forms of 
innovation (market, product, process, organisational and business innovation). It also seeks to identify the 
impact of innovation by distinguishing between incremental effects (marginal gains from process 
improvements) and powerful effects from radically new products and processes (incremental versus radical 
innovation). In this framework, strong emphasis has been placed on networking as a form of collective process 
innovation (collaborative innovation). Social capital is seen as a vital innovation asset capable of 
improving enterprises' access to knowledge services, financial resources and technology. As a result, 
institutions began to speed up and broaden the flow of information, diffusing best practices, innovation 
tools and technology. The collective innovation approach is based on the idea that firms influence the local 
business culture, creating trade links and easing risks of innovation failures. Besides, knowledge-intensive 
business services (interlinkers) are seen to create and strengthen a supportive environment for business 
activities by providing firms with access to venture capital, skilled labour, technical assistance, other 
experienced entrepreneurs and educational institutions. The policy also recognised the productive and 
geographical diversity of Mexico's enterprises (systemic model for growth). Although different regions 
have different needs, some may take innovative policy initiatives which others may choose to emulate. The federal government's main tool for shaping and implementing innovation-oriented 
entrepreneurship policy measures has been the SME Fund (Fondo Pyme) established in 2004. The SME 
Fund is run by the Under Ministry for SMEs created in 2001. In line with best practices, the Fund applies 
the principle of co-financing, having firms contribute their own resources for innovation-related projects. 
The SME Fund disburses subsidies through various intermediaries, including universities, R&D and 
technology centres, chambers, associations and foundations. Variable and temporary public-private 
partnerships have thus become a central element of entrepreneurship policies. The government has relied 
upon a 'trigger approach', imparting central policy impulses with a view to releasing widespread policy 
effects ('multiplier function'). The Fund for Technological Innovation (2007) complements the SME 
Fund's innovation-oriented operations (see below). Since its inception, the SME Fund has drawn up a comprehensive set of support programmes, some of 
them directly spurring incubation of business invention and innovation (Box 2.2) (OECD, SMEs in 
Mexico, 2007). These programmes seek to stimulate innovations through better access to new technology, 
R&D benefits and finance, while also offering better opportunities for entrepreneurial training and 
education. The SME Fund's budget totalled an estimated US 200 million in 2006. Since April 2007, the SME Fund's innovation-oriented programmes have been backed up by the Fund 
for Technological Innovation (2007). Run by the Ministry of the Economy and the National Research 
Council (CONACYT) and endowed with USD 55 million, the new Fund supports innovation projects 
under three strategic 'support lines': Development and technological innovation; creation and 
consolidation of groups or centres pursuing activities of engineering, design, research and technological 
development; and association-sponsored efforts of technological innovation. The guiding principle of the 
Fund's operations is a prompt transmutation of R&D benefits (inventions) into innovations through 
entrepreneurial activity. To this end, it promotes interactions between the business sector and the research 
community. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 63 Box 2.2. Selected Strategic Support Programmes (2005) Better access to new technology 1. The Programme for Innovation and Technological Development

Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovation activities a) 
Better access to new technology and R&D benefits The Mexican government views deepened and expanded networking linkages among different 
enterprise support units (business incubators, innovation laboratories, business development centres, 
centres of productive articulation), intermediate organisations and different levels of government as a 
condition sine qua non for accelerating the flow of new technology and R&D benefits. Effective webs of 
connections act as catalysts for diffusing new technology and rendering tailor-made initiatives of 
entrepreneurship policy more efficient. Networking programmes are thus seen as a kind of collective 
process innovation. Under this policy, activities of vertical networking have relied on both 'top-down' and 
'bottom-up' approaches. The Programme for Innovation and Technological Development Put into place after the establishment of the SME Fund in 2004, the programme supports innovative 
and R&D activities by way of augmenting the firm's ability to absorb and access new technology and 
specialised knowledge. The Programme for Innovation and Technological Development strives to establish 
links between firms and principal centres of applied research and technological development. Its lines of 
action mainly concern mature and fast-growing SMEs (HGSMEs). Sustained expansion of these firms 
often requires linkages with national and international networks. To this end, the programmes favour the 
creation of two kinds of enterprise support units: business accelerators (Aceleradores de Negocios) and 
innovation laboratories (Laboratorios de Innovacion en Nichos Especializados). @BULLET Business accelerators are all those organisations, institutions and specialised enterprises 
capable of identifying, assisting and financing technically-oriented firms during their 
expansion phase. In this capacity, business accelerators help HGSMEs strengthen innovative 
efforts, conquer new markets at home and abroad, attract business angels' investment and 
become part of international value chains. As a result, a web of business accelerators has 
been gradually built up since 2004 consisting in 2006 of six national units (three privately 
run accelerators and three units run by institutions of higher education) and four 
international accelerators. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 64 @BULLET Innovation laboratories are run by Higher education institutions and centres of applied 
research and act as service providers supporting firms' R&D efforts and innovative 
activities. In 2005, a network of innovation laboratories was set up, connecting all 
laboratories specialised in the design, prototyping and testing of micro electronic 
mechanisms MEMS (e.g. States of Puebla, Chihuahu and Mexico City). The Programme for 
Innovation and Technological Development has also promoted the transfer of technology 
from large to smaller firms in the automobile industry and underpinned the formation of 
clusters for robots and automation. The National System of Business Incubators Partially inspired by successful foreign programmes, in 2003 the federal government launched a 
business incubator programme (the National System of Business Incubators) aimed at lengthening the life 
of newly created enterprises. Previously, more than 50% of newly created firms went out of business two 
years after birth. The National System of Business Incubators (2003) offers a wide range of support 
services, including feasibility studies of market opportunities and administrative services including offices, 
skilled labour and information about access to finance and new technology. Services offered by business 
incubators appeal particularly to young entrepreneurs. About 80% of entrepreneurs using business 
incubators are 25-35 years old. There are three variants of business incubators. @BULLET The traditional one assisting the birth of firms in traditional sectors with standard material 
and immaterial input requirements. The usual incubation period for this category is about 
three months and at most six months. @BULLET The second variant (intermediate technology incubator) assists the birth of those firms which 
require knowledge inputs from specialised institutions, large firms and strategic innovation 
networks. The usual incubation period is between 12 and 18 months. @BULLET The third variant (high technology incubator) supports nascent firms in the domain of 
information technology, biotechnology, microelectronics, wireless technologies, robots, 
automation, nanotechnology and new, high-quality materials (e.g. ceramics). The normal 
incubation period for this category is about two years. Since its inception in 2003 and up til 2007, the incubator programme led to the creation of 
423 business incubators, which, in almost equal proportions (nearly one half), specialise in the use of 
traditional and intermediate technology (first and second variants). High-technology incubators account for 
less than 5% of the total. The incubators, in turn, induced the creation of 5 676 firms in 2003-2007, more 
than half of which use intermediate technology. High-technology firms accounted for 5% of incubator-
induced new businesses (Table 2.5). About 60% of financial support (an estimated USD 20 million) has 
come from the Federal, State and local governments, the remainder (USD 10 million) being financed by 
academia and the private sector. The average financial support per incubator-induced firm creation totalled 
USD 5 500 in 2004-2007. To ensure the continuity of the incubator programme, an autonomous National Council of Business 
Incubators (Consejo Nacional de Incubadoras de Empresas) was established. This council acts as a 
'window' for obtaining information about business incubators, paving the way for a national network of 
business incubators. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 65 Table 2.5. Business Incubators and Enterprises 2004

Better access to finance Under the Entrepreneurial Development Plan (EDP) for 2001-06, better access to finance has been a 
key lever for strengthening entrepreneurship and enterprise development. Accordingly, the authorities 
swiftly established grids of financial support lines extending credit guarantees at reduced cost. Financial 
institutions were called upon to create, modify and consolidate financial instruments so as to meet highly 
differentiated firms' needs. These policy initiatives were strengthened and refined with the shift to an 
innovation-based entrepreneurship policy in 2004. Three programmes emerged as main elements in the authorities' endeavours to deepen and widen the 
flow of financial funds to aspiring enterprises: The National Guarantee Programme; the National Financial 
Extension Programme; and the Capital for Development Schemes. The National Guarantee System Creating new financial instruments in the form of guarantee funds, the National Guarantee System 
(Sistema Nacional de Garantia, 2003) has strongly raised supplies of affordable financial resources. 
Adopting the portfolio approach, the Ministry of Economy enlarged the range of financial products, 
portfolio lines becoming broader as a consequence. Guaranteed credits are mostly of a short-term nature, 
nine-tenths of firms' credit demand serving the purpose of financing working capital. The default rate of 
Mexican guarantee programmes (0.92%) is far below the international standard of 5% pointing to low 
levels of moral hazard. The distribution of risk between the Ministry of Economy, NAFIN (State Development Bank) and 
financial institutions has been shown to be efficient. The operation of credit guarantee programmes has 
also prompted private financial institutions to extend new loans to SMEs, while developing new financial 
products. The associated rise in bank profitability has contributed to the establishment of new financial 
institutions. A bidding process for guarantee funds was started in 2005, kindling competition among financial 
intermediaries keen to obtain loan guarantees. Under the bidding procedure, the amount of guarantee funds 
rises with a rising leverage index and falling interest rates. In the previous setting, with direct provision of 
guarantees, the leverage of SME Fund resources was only 2 pesos of credit for each peso of funding. The 
auction technique raised the credit/fund ratios to 65 in 2007. Guarantee coverage falls into the range DSTI/DOC(2008)5 66 between 60 and 80%, which is high enough to avoid the use of collateral requirements and sufficiently low 
to escape from moral hazard. In 2003 and 2005, the flow of credit funds was also stimulated by new 
legislation facilitating the recovery of collateral. Nevertheless, legal proceedings have remained costly and 
long. The National Financial Extension Programme Established in 2004, the National Financial Extension Programme (Red Nacional de Extensionismo) 
provides a financial assessment net, helping firms enter into credit relationships. During the first phase, 
professional credit advisors assess the firm's financing needs, select the most suitable loan products and 
assist entrepreneurs in their credit negotiations. In a second phase, they monitor the subsequent use of 
credit funds. Through their nationwide network of branches, commercial banks help firms in the process of 
screening and improving credit applications. As a result, banks' risks perceptions have decreased, 
increasing supplies of pre-approved credits and lowering costs of credit approval. In 2006, the National 
Financial Extension Programme reached nationwide coverage, with all 32 Mexican States participating in 
the programme. Six hundred professional credit advisors, authorised by the Ministry of Economy, have 
helped process firms' credit applications and monitor the subsequent use of credit funds. In 2006, over 
8 000 firms benefited from cost-free credit advice and surveillance (0.3% of the firm population). The Capital for Development Schemes Two sub-programmes serve the purpose of increasing the supply of venture capital for growth-
oriented entrepreneurs: the Seed Capital Programme (Programma Capital Semilla PYME) and the Fund of 
Productive and Infrastructural Development Projects (FOPRODE). In addition, the authorities sponsor the 
creation of investment clubs and other instruments to channel private venture capital to innovative firms. @BULLET Under the Seed Capital Programme (2005), financial intermediaries and incubators release 
capital funds for firm creation. The supply of venture capital ranges from USD 10 000 to 
USD 200 000, depending upon the nature of planned firm creation (traditional, intermediate 
and high-technology firms). This sub-programme targets potential entrepreneurs with little 
or no experience in entrepreneurial activity. The Seed Capital Programme injects capital 
under twin formulas of partnership capital and quasi-capital. 񮽙 Under the partnership formula, entrepreneurs remain owners of their newly created 
company. Seed capital is released for a period of up to four years, the business 
incubator being the business associate. Financial resources are disbursed to the 
business incubator centres, allowing them to enter into a contractual, strategic 
partnership with the entrepreneur. Profits and losses are shared at the end of the 
contract period. The success of this programme largely hinges upon business 
incubators and intermediate organisations providing adequate follow-up to the 
release of capital funds. 񮽙 Under another variant of the Seed Capital Programme, quasi-capital is provided in 
the form of a loan at a subsidised annual interest rate of 6%, the initial grace period 
of 6, 12 or 18 months depending upon the nature of the planned enterprise 
traditional, intermediate or high technology). This scheme can also be operated by 
business incubator centres or financial intermediaries (non-bank banks). 
Requirements for own funds are 20% for traditional firms and 15% for non-DSTI/DOC(2008)5 67 traditional firms. Since the inception of this variant at the end of 2005, 302 
entrepreneurs have benefited from this programme. @BULLET The second sub-programme (FOPRODE) is a pilot project programme (2004) providing 
funds between USD 25 000 and USD 100 000 over a period of three to four years at a 
subsidised interest rate of 6% with a grace period of one year. FOPRODE mainly supports 
prospective innovative entrepreneurs with no proven entrepreneurial background, no credit 
file, no credit guarantees and no collateral. The FOPRODE programme is operated and 
managed by an intermediate organisation with national coverage, allowing local 
governments to participate. Local financial institutions are able to identify and evaluate 
projects as well as to formalise credit contracts, manage and recover credit portfolios. 
Investment proposals are received and assessed via an electronic window operating through 
Internet. In 2006, more than 200 firms benefited from this scheme. Another avenue used for supplying venture capital are Investors' Clubs, which are 'civil 
organisations' composed of investors intent on realising high rates of return on capital through investments 
in innovative firms. For individual members, investment clubs reduce operation costs and risks and 
augment investment capacity. For entrepreneurs, investment clubs release private venture capital which is 
otherwise unavailable. The PYME Option (2006) represents a unique type of investment guarantee 
designed to spur the creation of investment clubs and venture capital funds geared towards early stage 
investing. Beneficiaries of PYME Option are firms engaged in innovative, high value added or export-oriented 
activities or which are clearly oriented towards integration in industrial chains. PYME Option offers 
investors flexible procedures to cover the risk in case of business failure. The amount of capital covered 
has a ceiling of USD 500 000 and a limit of 70% of investment projects, a duration of coverage ranging 
from three to five years. c) 
Better access to entrepreneurial education and training Some programmes shown in Box 2 focus on improving entrepreneurship education and training as 
well as widening access to skilled labour and business services: the Business Development Centres 
Network, the Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms' Capabilities and the National Network of 
Productive Articulation. The new, incoming government (December 2006) has stepped up efforts to 
broaden and upgrade entrepreneurial education so as to augment the participation in entrepreneurial 
activity. The Business Development Centres Network Business development centres (BDCs or Centros de Desarrollo Empresaria) are locally established 
support units providing a wide range of basic and more sophisticated firm support services. Mexico's 
BDCs provide 'business solutions', but no direct entrepreneurship training, e.g. helping firms draw up loan 
requests based upon BDC assessment of financial needs. Services rendered by public BDCs are free of 
charge, while private BDCs demand a moderate fee (OECD, SMEs in Mexico, 2007). Sponsored by chambers of commerce, industry and educational institutions, BDCs have been 
developed since 2001 as part of the 2001-2006 Entrepreneurial Development Plan (EDP). By the end of 
2007, public and private BDCs numbered more than 170. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 68 There are two types of BDCs: @BULLET Conventional BDCs provide basic firm support services (especially to subsistence 
entrepreneurs). @BULLET BDCs Plus contribute to creating favourable framework conditions for innovative firms 
(high-value-added investment projects, growth-oriented entrepreneurs). Since 2004, BDCs are subject to systematic monitoring by the SME Fund. The SME Fund has issued 
terms of reference for what constitute 'standard' or 'required' BDC operations. These efforts at 
harmonisation seek to augment BDC efficiency, paving the way for creating an effective network of BDCs. 
Such a network tends to induce mutual learning processes triggered by information exchange. In pursuit of this aim, the SME Fund has helped establish pilot BDC groups, which exchange views 
about how to run themselves more efficiently. A standardised management system has been designed 
which BDCs need to apply in order to obtain operational authorisation from the Ministry of Economy. 
Pilot groups have also identified efficient ways in which BDCs can employ e-learning and the Internet as a 
platform for spreading entrepreneurship training programmes. The BDC approach adopted by the SME 
Fund allows the most dynamic BDCs to be identified, enabling them, at a later stage, to grow into a strong 
nucleus of the BDC network. The Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms' Capabilities The second programme is concerned with opening access to education and training. This programme 
aims at creating and upgrading entrepreneurial human capital allowing a better absorption of new 
technologies in all areas of entrepreneurial activities (managerial and administrative skills as well as 
marketing strategies). The programme facilitates access to training for owners and managers, especially of 
micro firms (subsistence entrepreneurs): through this programme, consultants provide systematic and 
methodological training to firms. Well-focused workshops and interviews with managers and workers, 
however brief, have led to significant productivity improvements. Since 2005, training options have been increasingly adapted to their potential impact on different 
forms of innovation. The SME Fund also encouraged firms to participate in interactive processes of 
information and knowledge exchanges, thereby stimulating the collective efficiency of different enterprise 
groups. As noted above, Mexico's entrepreneurship policies consider collective efficiency as a vital 
innovation asset. The Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms' Capabilities offers access to three types of 
training: conventional training for administrative, commercial, financial and productive activities; 
specialised training for product and process innovations; and training the 'coaches'. Special training efforts were also undertaken under the so-called PROMODE programme which helps 
large numbers of potential subsistence entrepreneurs opening their retail shop. The target for 2006 was to 
offer training support for as many as 160 000 firms in the retail sector. The National Network of Productive Articulation The third programme seeking to improve entrepreneurship education, training and business services is 
the National Network of Centres of Productive Articulation (Centros de Articulacion Productiva, CAP). An 
outgrowth of private initiatives, CAPs are micro or small business units (support units) acting as a hub for DSTI/DOC(2008)5 69 rendering high-value-added business services to selected branches of industry, commerce and services. At 
the end of 2005, CAPs totalled 81. CAPs may serve to create databases of potential customers for producers of well-defined products and 
services, allowing swift adaptation of design and production to changing consumer needs. CAPs also serve 
to scrutinise investment projects of affiliated enterprises and help upgrade training of both entrepreneurs 
and coaches. Finally, CAPs provide consultation services for potential network members, inducing 'would-
be' entrepreneurs to become firm creators. d) 
Reducing the cultural bias against entrepreneurial activity Entrepreneurship receives nation-wide attention during the annual week for SMEs, a national event. 
The SME week has been successful in attracting 50 000 firms by providing on-the-spot information, 
training and network opportunities. Mobile information centres (SME policy vans) spread information 
about opportunities to benefit from government support. Finally, business fora, partly financed by the SME 
Fund, are organised throughout the year, attracting 'would-be' entrepreneurs. In 2004-06, close to 18 000 
micro firms have been able to establish first contacts with bigger firms and institutions. III. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation Faced with a strongly ailing firm population, Mexico has adopted a new, evolutionary and 
differentiated policy approach. Being flexible and comprehensive in nature, entrepreneurship policies 
(2001-06) have reduced impediments to entrepreneurial activity and innovation in three major areas: R&D 
and technology, finance, capabilities and access to skilled labour. The innovation-oriented focus of 
entrepreneurship policies was sharpened in 2007 with the creation of the Fund for Technological 
Innovation. Run by the Ministry of Economy and the National Research Council, the new Fund 
complements SME support programmes designed by the SME Fund, Mexico's main tool for SME and 
entrepreneurship policies. The principal policy instrument employed for impediment reduction has been collective process 
innovation ('institutional road building'). Such collaborative innovations have partly taken the form of 
creating horizontal and vertical network links between entrepreneurial support units (business incubators, 
innovation laboratories, business developments centres and business accelerators). Along with an 
expanded range of support units, 'institutional road building' has progressively raised the efficiency of 
central policy impulses imparted by the SME FUND (Table 2.6). Table 2.6. Entrepreneurship policy: stages of firm evolution Entrepreneurship

i.e. different levels of government, intermediate organisations (non-banking banks, foundations, business 
associations, international organisations) as well as educational and research institutions. In line with best 
practice, administrative powers have been decentralised, contributing to improved policy co-ordination at 
all levels of government. State and local governments have thus been able to participate more actively in 
the design and execution of novel entrepreneurship policy projects. 1. 
Improved access to new technology, benefits from R&D and networking facilities The innovation-oriented policy approach has facilitated access to new technology by way of 
establishing and expanding networks of enterprise support units, including business incubators, innovation 
laboratories, business accelerators, centres of applied research and technological development. Both the 
rising number of the support units and expanded and deepened linkages among them as well as sharply 
rising numbers of programme beneficiaries testify to a significantly improved climate for innovation 
diffusion. In 2006, the SME Fund spent about 30% of its budget on these programmes. In 2004-07, business incubators induced the creation of nearly 5 700 firms (1.5% of Mexico's firm 
population), two-thirds of which have used intermediate technology. Product and process innovations have 
also been fostered by business accelerators for high-growth SMEs. 2. 
Improved access to finance Firms' access to finance has become much easier with the introduction of innovation-oriented policy 
measures. The supply of short-term credit funds from both banks and non-banks has strongly risen with 
innovative guarantee procedures (auction mechanism), a vastly increased number of financial instruments, 
improved information flows between credit institutions and upgraded advice for credit-seeking enterprises 
(National Guarantee Programme and National Financial Extension Programme). The default rate of Mexican guarantee programmes is very low by international comparison, mainly 
reflecting reasonable guarantee coverage and a well-balanced distribution of risk between the Ministry of 
Economy, the State Development (NAFIN) and financial institutions. Improved supply conditions have 
allowed interest rates for short-term bank credits to enterprises to fall relative to standard short-term 
interest rates. Reduced cost of finance, apart from stimulating entrepreneurial activity, has also encouraged 
'informal' entrepreneurs to join the formal economy. The bulk of increased credit volumes has gone to small and medium-sized enterprises (growth-
oriented entrepreneurship). By contrast, micro credits, totalling USD 308 million in 2005 or USD 77 per 
each micro enterprise in the formal economy, remained small, especially relative to potential bank credit 
demand of subsistence entrepreneurs. Altogether, the SME Fund used 30% of its resources for easing 
firms' access to finance in 2006. Starting from low levels, the supply of venture capital and longer-term credit funds has also increased 
(Capital for Development Schemes). Reflecting reduced barriers to finance, interest rates for credits to 
enterprises have decreased relative to standard interest rates. Transaction costs have also been reduced by 
the removal of collateral requirements for some categories of credits and by upgraded credit advice. 3. 
Improved access to skilled labour and business services Several programmes, absorbing more than 40% of the SME Fund's resources, have enlarged and 
upgraded the access to skilled labour and business services (Business Development Centres Network 
(BDCs), Programme for Training and Strengthening Firms' Capabilities). Increased supplies of business 
services are evident in the expansion of business development centres (BDCs), the establishment of new DSTI/DOC(2008)5 71 high-quality service centres (centres of productive articulation, CAPs) and rising numbers of well-focused 
workshops and interviews. Stricter monitoring and network building have improved the quality of BDCs' services. Moreover, 
since 2005 training options have been adapted to potential impacts of different types of innovation. Finally, 
large numbers of subsistence entrepreneurs have benefited from basic training services, triggering wide-
spread non-R&D innovations and raising production efficiency (PROMODE programme). Concluding remarks Overall, Mexico's new innovation-oriented policy effort has been unprecedented in both scale and 
depth. Gauging aggregate policy effects, though, is still difficult. Policy lead times are long, most statistical 
data is inadequate, and appropriate evaluation procedures are not yet in place. Even so, a number of 
encouraging signs have emerged, pointing to a positive impact of new innovation-oriented policies. On the 
input side, the number of entrepreneurs receiving some kind of policy help has surged, rising to an 
estimated 254 000 in 2006 compared with 13 000 in 2000. Two-thirds of enterprises receiving support in 
2006 were micro firms. For some categories of firms, access to finance has become less difficult. On the 
output side, the average survival time of new firms has lengthened over the past few years, partly reflecting 
the rising weight of incubator-induced firms in the pool of newly created firms. The network of business 
incubators has been considerably expanded. Positive signals notwithstanding, room for still better entrepreneurship policy efforts remains large. 
Sluggish productivity trends, reflecting firms' inefficient production modes, call for strongly increased 
government resources. 49 Much stronger emphasis should be placed on improving firms' access to new 
technology, finance and skilled labour. Continued network building, designing new financial instruments, 
increased supplies of basic advisory and training services as well as better facilities for entrepreneurship 
education are essential for lifting vast numbers of subsistence entrepreneurs out of poverty and 
inefficiency. 49 OECD (2007), SMEs in Mexico. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 72 Box 2.3. Policy recommendations Increase resources for entrepreneurship and SME policies Increase financial resources available to the SME Fund

DSTI/DOC(2008)5 78 NORWAY Introduction Norway is committed to implementing entrepreneurship and SME policies as a tool for speeding up 
the pace of innovation and restructuring the business sector. Entrepreneurship policy is rightly seen as a 
crucial element for spurring the birth and growth of firms in a setting of rapid changes in consumer 
preferences, trade, technology, innovation and access to resources. The link between entrepreneurial policy 
and innovation is, by nature, indirect. Efficient measures of entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation 
and growth, and in doing so, they strengthen innovative activity. Viewed from a wider angle, 
entrepreneurship policy itself may pave the way for 'collective process innovations', augmenting the 
effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on individual innovations. The first part of this chapter highlights the main features of Norway's enterprise population, identifies 
main drivers of entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The 
second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes in four 
major areas of policy intervention: access to R&D and technology, access to finance, capabilities and 
access to skilled labour, and cultural values. The third part provides an evaluation of entrepreneurship 
policy. I. 
Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation 1. 
Main characteristics of the enterprise sector Norway's business structure is characterised by large numbers of micro firms (Figure 3.1), 
representing over 90% of the firm population in 2007. Nearly two thirds of the enterprise stock has no 
employees. In the private non-oil sector, there are only a few large companies. Figure 3.1. Distribution of enterprises by firm size (2007) 90.3% 8.2% 1.4% 0.1% 0%

comprised 99.5% of the stock of enterprises and employed about 63% of the total number of employees. 
Their turnover represented about 53% of the total enterprise turnover. In comparison 1 540 larger 
enterprises with more than 100 employees represented about 0.5% of the stock of enterprises in 2004, 
employed about 37% of the total number of employees and represented about 47% of the total turnover

industries, SMEs accounted for more than 99% of businesses in 2004, while in other sectors such as 
transportation and communication, hotels and restaurants, the share was slightly lower (98%). In 
manufacturing, 98% of the enterprises were SMEs, with a comparatively strong presence of medium-sized 
firms employing between 10 and 250 persons. In contrast, the share of micro firms is comparatively low 
(Annex 3.1, Table A.3.1). Given the importance of its resource-based economy, only 7% of the enterprises in Norway are in the 
manufacturing sector (Table 3.2). Norway has few high-technology industries outside the petroleum sector. 
The share of low-tech manufacturing production in the total manufacturing output is about 80%, a 
considerably higher figure than almost any OECD country. Low-tech, however, does not entail low 
productivity: the level of productivity is high in general. Norway enjoys a high level of GDP per capita, 
which cannot be only explained by rising oil and gas exports. 51 50 In Norway, SMEs are defined as companies with less than 100 employees. Large firms are defined as 
companies with more than 100 employees. 51 OECD (2007), Economic Surveys Norway (page 125). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 80 Table 3.2 Share of enterprises and employment by sector (2006) Enterprises

and regional dispersion of GDP per capita is far below the OECD average (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.1). 
Counties situated in the southern part of Norway (Oslo, Akershus, Rogaland, Hordaland) host more 
enterprises than northern counties such as Finnmark, Troms and Nord-Trondelag that are more remote 
from the capital and more sparsely populated. The counties situated in the southern part of Norway are also 
the ones that host most of the large enterprises. Rates of firm birth and death are high by international comparison (Figure 3.2). In 2006, 
51 246 companies were established (16% of the stock of companies) and 41 121 (13% of the enterprise 
stock) were dismantled, while 3 032 enterprises went bankrupt, representing 1% of the company stock. The 
survival rate for self-run enterprises (with no employees) is low relative to the survival rate of other SMEs, 
with only 17% of self-run firms created in 2001 surviving for more than three years. The magnitude of start-ups from 2006 partly reflects new legislation on the taxation of dividends. 
Dividends paid by one company to another are exempt from taxation. There are also advantages in owning 
property through companies. The implicit financial incentive has led to stronger firm creation. According to the 2005 OECD Survey  " Policy Questionnaire on Bankruptcy "  52 possibilities for 
reorganising a company and chances of getting a fresh start in case of financial difficulties appear to be 
lower in Norway than in other OECD countries, where early warning systems for financially distressed 
companies, fast track mechanisms for reorganisation or fast track discharge proceedings for legitimate 
bankruptcies are available. FORA indicators also show that bankruptcy recovery rates are high compared 
to other OECD countries, indicating that the investor's potential loss is limited in case of business 
closure. 53 52 The 2005 Survey on Bankruptcy analyses and compares regulation of rehabilitation, liquidation and 
restructuring of debt and discharge in different OECD countries. 53 FORA (2007), Quality Assessment of Entrepreneurship Indicators. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 81 Figure 3.2. Birth and death rates As a percentage of total number of enterprises (2003) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 % Birth rate

Factors driving firm creation and expansion a) 
Access to new technology and R&D benefits Penetration of information and communication technology (ICTs) is high and basic 
telecommunication connections are available at a reasonable price. The number of broadband subscribers 
for instance is amongst the highest in OECD countries although prices are higher than in some 
neighbouring countries (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.3). The total use of wideband/broadband in industry has 
increased by 24% between 2006 and 2007. Besides, mobile telephone charges are low as it is also the case 
in other Nordic countries (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.2). Investment in ICT equipment and software 
nonetheless been lower in Norway than in other OECD countries between 2000 and 2003 (Figure 3.3). 
Perceived barriers to the usage of ICT by enterprises include the shortcomings of the software received, the 
expenses linked to IT as well as the inflexibility of IT suppliers. 54 54 Information from Statistics Norway. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 82 Figure 3.3. Investment in ICT

countries in 2005. Most countries with lower R&D spending also have lower per capita income (Annex 
3.A, Figure 3.A.4). The ratio has been lower than that of EU countries for more than 20 years and there is 
no sign of convergence. Private sector R&D spending is particularly low, business R&D spending 
amounting to only 1.2% of industry value added compared to 2.2% for OECD countries in 2005 (Annex 
3.A Figure 3.A.5). The gap in private R&D spending is very large relative to other high per capita income 
countries (Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland), notwithstanding an R&D tax credit scheme introduced in 
2002 (Skattefunn). According to national surveys, only 26% of Norwegian enterprises conducted innovation-related 
activities in the period 2002-2004. 55 The reported innovation activity is a little lower than for the period 
1999-2001 (29%). SMEs seem to lag behind many other OECD countries in terms of product and process 
innovation (Annex 3.A, Figures 3.A.6 and 7). SMEs in Norway collaborate less in innovation activities 
than elsewhere, notably compared to other Nordic countries (Figure 3.4). 55 Innovation activities are defined as a product or process innovation (Statistics Norway). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 83 Figure 3.4.

Access to finance The banking system seems relatively efficient -interest rates and risk premiums are modest, both 
from a historical perspective and compared to other OECD countries (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.8). Access to 
bank loans seems adequate, including loans without collateral, an important source of finance to many 
entrepreneurs who lack transferable securities and other assets that can serve as collateral. Overall, access 
to loans without collateral appears to be easier than in many other OECD countries, 56 which may explain 
the declining use of government guarantee schemes in recent years. Norway's equity market, on the other hand, is relatively underdeveloped, with private equity 
investment equal to around 15% of GDP as against 25% of GDP in the EU. 57 According to data from the 
Norwegian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (NVCA), local institutions or the state provide 
most of the funds for the venture capital market. Private investors supply only about one-third of the total. 
While supplies of venture capital are larger than in many other OECD countries, they fall short of levels 
seen in other Nordic countries, especially in the domain of early-stage funding (Figure 3.5). 56 FORA (2007), Quality Assessment of Entrepreneurship Indicators. 57 OECD (2007), Economic Surveys Norway.

Access to capabilities and to skilled labour Norway has been successful in building a high level of human capital. Average years spent in formal 
education for both men and women are among the highest in the OECD and have been so for many 
decades. Norway ranks very high in terms of upper-secondary education and about 40% of the population 
aged 25-34 had at least tertiary education in 2004 (Annex 3.A, Figures 3.A.9 and 10). The number of 
students pursuing scientific and technical courses has, however, fallen, and Norwegian students score less 
than most other advanced OECD countries in the PISA test (Annex 3.A, Figure 3.A.11). d) 
Cultural factors Surveys (GEM 2006) indicate that Norway has a strong entrepreneurial culture, having a high early-
stage entrepreneurial activity rate for a country with a high GDP per capita income. Over 9% of the adult 
population (18-64 years) was involved in early stage entrepreneurial activities in 2006 (versus 7% in DSTI/DOC(2008)5 85 2004). There are however significant differences by gender. Although the share of female participation in 
early stage entrepreneurial activities has increased from 24% in 2005 to 32% in 2006, it still remains 
relatively low: under 6% of women were involved in early stage entrepreneurial activities in 2006 against 
12.3% of men. Entrepreneurship in Norway is highly opportunity-driven and is not based on necessity. According to 
surveys, being more independent is the main motivation for pursuing entrepreneurial activities. Increasing 
income ranks as a lower motivation. As in other countries, tax and regulatory requirements influence the choice between becoming an 
employee, or being self-employed. Compared to employees, the self-employed have lower social security 
contributions while being entitled to lower social benefits. However, the self-employed may choose to 
establish a private limited company and employ themselves. By doing this, they have to pay both the 
employers' national insurance contribution and the social security contribution as an employee. In 
exchange, they receive social benefits as an employee. II. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies 1. 
Overall aims of entrepreneurship policy A Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy was launched in October 2003 (Box 3.1). The plan, 
known as  " From Idea to Value " , aims at better co-ordinated and targeted efforts for innovation and 
improved harmonisation of Entrepreneurship and SME policy. The plan is the result of broad co-operation 
between a number of ministries, including the Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, 
the Minister of Education and Research, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Petroleum and Energy 
and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The Plan highlights five main policy areas central to innovation policy with specific objectives and 
measures in each area (general conditions for trade and industry; knowledge and competency; research, 
development and commercialisation; entrepreneurship – starting a new business; and electronic and 
physical infrastructure). While Ministries issue national guidelines, the county administrations are 
responsible for the regional strategies. The plan From Idea to Value builds on previous policy efforts to 
simplify regulation affecting business (Simplifying Norway Action Plan, 2002) and to facilitate the process 
of establishing and running a business (Bedin Internet service). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 86 Box 3.1 Calendar of major Entrepreneurship and SME Policy events 1998

Preparation of the White paper on innovation The Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy provides a framework for SME and 
Entrepreneurship policy. Companies in an early stage and SMEs  " with potential and ambitions for growth "  
have been defined as priority areas. The aim for Entrepreneurship policy is to speed up the pace of 
innovation and restructuring of the Norwegian business sector through start-ups. This is notably to be 
achieved through a strengthened Norwegian culture of entrepreneurship with special attention to the 
younger population. The Strategy for Entrepreneurship in Education (2004), which aims to integrate 
entrepreneurship in the curriculum, was launched in this context and has been revised in 2006. The revised 
version of the education strategy was presented at the conference  " Entrepreneurship education in Europe: 
Fostering entrepreneurial mindsets through education and learning "  in Oslo in October 2006. For SMEs, network-based innovation and restructuring has been targeted with designated focus areas 
of regional or local nature. The idea is to meet the restructuring needs of local communities or regions 
where key industries and innovation systems are either to be restructured, or developed. Finally, policy has 
aimed at increasing innovation across the Norwegian business sector and at increasing the number of 
innovation projects based on market demand. Main actors Entrepreneurship and SME policies are designed, implemented and monitored by three Ministries: the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of Local 
Government and Regional development (Figure 3.6). Three major agencies support the policies: 
Innovation Norway, the Industrial Development Corporation (SIVA) and the Research Council of Norway 
(RCN). Various supporting sub-units carry through business development and innovation at regional and 
national levels. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 87 Figure 3.6. Major stakeholders of Entrepreneurship and SME policy Ministry of

Incubators Funds Fund Innovation Norway, 58 created in 2004 to implement the innovation strategy, offers an improved and 
better co-ordinated access to the full spectrum of public support for business and innovation. Innovation 
Norway is funded primarily by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Local Government 
and Regional development. Its main objective is to promote business development and increase the 
competitiveness of individual companies and groups of companies throughout the country; to release the 
commercial opportunities of the districts and regions. To achieve this, Innovation Norway delivers services 
ranging from financing, linking companies to know-how and helping to create networks. It also assists in 
restructuring and revitalising specific industries and regions. Services provided include for example the 
provision of seed capital to start-up firms together with the private sector. Innovation Norway also 
promotes R&D contracts (IFU) where as two parties (normally an SME supplier and a customer) commit 
to developing an innovative product, service or process which is new to the market. Innovation Norway's 
budget for 2008 is NOK 2 500 million and NOK 1 840 million (for the loan and guarantee framework). SIVA, a state enterprise owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has been in charge of 
improving the national infrastructure for innovative business activities. This has been achieved through 
increased networking, the promotion of strong regional and local industrial clusters and an increased range 
of business services. As a result, a large number of business development centers, business gardens and 
incubators have been set up in the different Norwegian counties in recent years and are co-owned by 
SIVA. The annual budget for SIVA in 2007 was NOK 100 million. The Research Council of Norway (RCN) promotes and supports basic and applied research as well as 
research-driven innovation in all sectors and branches. RCN is a strategic body which identifies areas 
where efforts are needed, allocates research funds and evaluates results. It acts as a contact point, network-
builder and administrator of programmes where private industry, R&D institutions and universities are 
involved. The Ministry of Education and Research has administrative responsibility for RCN and is also its 
largest contributor. The Ministry of Trade and Industry provides about 20% of the budget to finance 
projects relating to industrial R&D projects. RCN's annual budget for 2007 was more than NOK 5 billion. 58 Innovation Norway is a merger of four previously separate institutions: the Norwegian Industrial and 
Regional Development Fund (SDN), the Norwegian Trade Council (NTC), the government's Advisory 
Board for Investors and the Norwegian Tourist Board. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 88 2. 
Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovation activities a) 
Access to technology, R&D benefits and networking activities Supporting private R&D A tax credit scheme (Skattefunn) was introduced in 2002 to encourage private R&D and innovation. 
Since its inception it has received strong support from the business sector. Approval of projects is given by 
the RCN according to R&D content. The qualifying projects must generate new knowledge in a broad 
sense that favours the development of new products, processes or services. There are no regional or 
sectoral constraints. Skattefunn provides a 20% deduction of R&D costs, up to NOK 4 million, per firm 
and per year for internal projects and an additional NOK 4 million for R&D purchases from universities 
and institutes. Large companies benefit from an 18% deduction 59 with ceilings being the same. Enterprises 
that have no or insufficient taxable income are paid the equivalent as a grant. The scheme is neutral 
between qualifying projects, regions, sectors and the tax position of qualifying firms. It nonetheless lowers 
the marginal cost of R&D in small enterprises or low R&D spenders more than in larger ones. Facilitating business and networking activities The system set up to promote business and networking activities is comprehensive and consists of 
Business gardens, research parks and incubators. SIVA has a key role in promoting strong regional and 
local industrial clusters. It builds networks between regional, national and international R&D 
environments. These are developed through a functional infrastructure of investments and networking. 
Investments are made in venture companies, innovative companies, incubators and network companies. As the Norwegian government's policy goal is to unleash innovation capability and increase wealth 
creation in all parts of the country, SIVA's strategy deploys a variety of instruments in order to address the 
needs of different parts of the country. Business gardens (or Business development centers) were established in 1998 as a support scheme 
under the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. This scheme is one of the concepts 
designed for the most rural areas of Norway: 45 business gardens have been developed across Norway to 
enhance entrepreneurship and new business development in remote areas without colleges or universities. 
Business gardens locate knowledge-based companies in innovative networks to stimulate innovation in 
SMEs and the development of new enterprises. They have a multi-stakeholder approach which makes them 
networking hubs: they function as a partner for companies, investors and R&D environments. Incubators aim to provide entrepreneurs with resources in the form of expertise, business experience, 
consultants and capital -mainly from Universities and R&D institutions. nineteen incubators have been 
established across Norway. Depending on performances, each incubator receives approximately 
NOK 3.5 million over 5 years. The scheme is financed by the Ministry of Local Government and Regional 
Development. The new incubator programme is oriented towards regional innovative environments; SIVA 
therefore focuses on developing regional expertise in business incubation. Industry incubators are types of incubators that are tied to heavy industry companies or to a 
unification of industry companies (instead of being bound to a research environment). The main function 
of the incubator is to identify business ideas and to find entrepreneurs ready to start new businesses. The 
industry companies are central to the success of the incubator, as they would provide premises, competence 59 This is due to EU/EEA state aid rule. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 89 and leadership. These companies also engage on purchasing products or services of the newly established 
businesses over some time. Transfering new technology and commercialising R&D Research parks are closely and formally connected to leading universities and colleges and contribute 
to increased regional value creation by applying research results in complicated products, processes and 
services. They act as innovative clusters where businesses, R&D and public programmes together allow 
innovation and the commercialisation of innovation. Technology Transfer Offices (TTO) were set up in Norwegian universities as from 1993 to facilitate 
commercialisation of research and development by assisting academics who are unfamiliar with 
procedures involved to exploit their finding financially. They are staffed by 10-15 persons, and offer 
scientists and students evaluation of their business ideas, patenting, licensing and advisory services on how 
to start a company and business development. From 2003, all universities and colleges in Norway were 
instructed to contribute to the commercialisation of new ideas from the institutions. The FORNY programme was established in 2000 to enhance the commercialisation of research with 
considerable market potential. It is a joint programme between the RCN and Innovation Norway which 
funds activities making researchers and research institutions focus on the commercial potential of research 
results, the process of establishing a new company or licence, the cost of verification of technology and 
scholarships for researchers. FORNY works through institutions that employ the researchers, through the 
TTO of these institutions, a selection of their co-operating innovation companies and science parks. The 
FORNY funding can cover up to 50% of the costs related to these activities. In 2006, FORNY had a budget 
of NOK 120 million. b) 
Better access to finance Given conditions prevailing in the Norwegian financial sector (see above), recent government 
programmes have justifiably focused on improving access to equity capital for enterprises by strengthening 
the equity market and by improving communication between enterprises and investors. A special focus has 
been to give enterprises sufficient access to capital in early stages, especially for projects involving new 
technology and knowledge-based businesses. Risk loans have been used for innovation and development 
project funding, as well as for investments in fixed assets. Some loan guarantee and grant schemes remain 
(see Box 3.2). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 90 Box 3.2 Loan guarantees and grant schemes Guarantees have been available to reduce the risk factor in connection with loans and operating credits from 
other financing institutions. Grants have financed development projects such as product or process development or 
market development. Grant schemes have for example been given to stimulate close co-operation in product 
development between a costumer company and different suppliers. The Innovation Norway guarantee scheme targets SMEs with up to 100 employees. The guarantee covers losses 
up to 50% on loans granted by private banks. The loans are normally extended for working capital, the banks 
establishing collaterals in borrowers' assets. These guarantees are seldom used 
60 because of stringent conditionality: 
private banks must sell all assets serving as collateral for a guaranteed loan before the guarantees will be in effect. Most micro loans are available through the Cultura Bank which has different loan schemes, offering a guarantee 
scheme in co-operation with the European Investment Fund (EIF). Start-up loans are subject to an upper limit of 
EUR 25 000. The EIF covers 75% of the loss guarantee. Cultura Bank is co-operating with Network Credit BA which 
helps entrepreneurs establish network groups, which makes them eligible for receiving micro loans through the  " Micro 
Invest "  foundation. 
61 The foundation has become a guarantee institution backing loans awarded by the Cultura Bank. The private equity market in Norway is small and fragmented by European standards and it appears as 
one of the weakest capital offerings available to SMEs. To address this market gap in funding for new 
firms, notably in the early phases, the Norwegian government instaured mechanisms to provide risk capital 
investors with public co-investment schemes (the Seed capital scheme and Argentum). The government 
also recently set up a public investment fund to allow a broader flow of financial funds available to 
enterprises with high growth potential. @BULLET The Seed capital scheme is a public/private partnership administered by Innovation Norway, on 
behalf of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Each part contributes half of the capital stock in the 
seed capital funds; there is an equal share between subordinated loans from the government and a 
mixture of equity and subordinated loans from investors. The funds which are privately owned 
invest equity capital in start-up businesses with high value added potential. The aim of the seed 
capital scheme is to increase the share of high growth companies. These funds are supposed to 
have a long-term perspective on the investments and supply enterprises with competence. 
Government provides risk-relief to private investors through a loss-fund. The loss-fund for each 
fund accumulates to NOK 341.75 million. Recent amendments to the seed capital schemes have 
been introduced to make follow-on investments easier for private investors as previous 
restrictions on follow-on investments had been met with investor resistance. @BULLET Argentum is a government-owned fund-of-fund investor in the private equity sector that was 
established in 2001 and is governed by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. It has 
been set up to develop a fragmented private equity sector mainly composed of the State and 
wealthy private individuals. Through its investments, Argentum aims to facilitate access to 
international venture capital and to develop an internationally competitive private equity 
environment in Norway. It invests through either established or new fund management structures. 
Argentum focuses on attracting fund managers to Norway based on existing strong industries. 
Only a small portion of capital is allocated to purely international funds. All investments have 
private majority ownership. The government provided NOK 2.65 billion to the fund. 60 Six guarantees during 2006 and 2007 of NOK 6 million. 61 Established in 2003, this foundation is funded by Network Credit BA and Cultura Bank. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 91 @BULLET The new Governmental investment fund (created in 2007) is a national investment fund fostering 
new established companies with high growth potential. It aims to facilitate commercialisation of 
globally oriented and competitive projects at an early stage by offering long-term risk capital. 
Five priority areas have been identified: environment, tourism, energy, coastal and maritime 
industries. To increase transparency in the venture capital market and to facilitate the release of private venture 
capital, Innovation Norway has supported private initiatives to increase the flow of information between 
businesses and risk capital investors (Connect Norway, Seed Forum Norway, Venturelab). It has notably 
provided financial support to the establishment of Business Angel Networks. No organised network with 
adequate mechanisms for connecting investors and entrepreneurs existed in the past. c) 
Better access to entrepreneurial education and training Entrepreneurship Education In 2004 the government launched a national Strategy for Entrepreneurship in Education. The 
government put forward several new and concrete initiatives designed to promote education and training 
for entrepreneurship. The purpose of the strategy is to profile entrepreneurship as an educational objective 
and training strategy. Entrepreneurship in education is perceived as an important tool in fostering a culture 
for entrepreneurship and positive attitudes towards entrepreneurs. Teaching entrepreneurship is expected 
not only to strengthen confidence in the ability to succeed as an entrepreneur, but also to improve the 
ability to assess the profitability of different projects. The strategy addresses the entire educational system from primary school to college and university 
and also includes teacher training. 62 It was developed in co-operation by three ministries: the Ministry of 
Education and Research, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Regional Development 
and Local Government. An inter-ministerial reference group allows collaboration between the different 
ministries and the follow-up of the strategy. The strategy was revised in 2006, and an important part focuses on the support to organisations and 
other stakeholders that promote entrepreneurship education. It motivates educational institutions, 
municipalities and country municipalities to establish training in entrepreneurship in close collaboration 
with trade and industry and other stakeholders of the local environment (e.g. local business and the social 
sector). Training in entrepreneurship requires close collaboration between schools, the local business and 
the social sector. At primary, lower and upper secondary level, entrepreneurship education is emphasised differently in 
schools and its extent in different counties varies significantly. The Government supports  " Junior 
Achievement -Young Enterprise Norway "  (JA-YE) in the context of its strategic plan. JA-YE, established 
in 1997, is the largest private supplier of entrepreneurship training in Norway and supports government 
efforts to increase the supply and quality of entrepreneurial education. It has a national administration and 
local branches in all counties. It provides training and teacher training at all stages of education. 
In 2005/2006, 12 000 pupils took part in 1 900 enterprises in 300 upper secondary schools. The Ministry of 
Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development and the Ministry of 
Education and Research allocated NOK 16.8 million to the organisation in 2007. 63 62 In 2005/2006 about 20 teacher training institutions provided post and further education programmes. 63 Junior Achievement -Young Enterprise Norway is also being financed by several county municipalities. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 92 Regarding Higher Education, a number of Universities and colleges provide both compulsory and 
elective subjects of study within entrepreneurship, especially linked to education in economics and 
technology. 64 Programmes targeted to some specific professions do not seem sufficiently developed, 
however. Courses also include practice and are done in collaboration/partnerships with local business. A 
wide range of initiatives has promoted entrepreneurship at Higher Education level (Box 3.3). The 
Norwegian Research Council is currently working on a scheme allowing doctoral dissertations to be 
written in collaborative projects between universities and the business sector. Adults may receive education and training. The concept of  " Introductory Enterprises "  has been 
launched where immigrants can develop their abilities in entrepreneurship under expert guidance. It has 
been moduled on the JA-YE concept. Currently six pilot projects have been launched in six different 
municipalities. Box 3.3 Initiatives promoting entrepreneurship in Higher Education @BULLET Europrise: practical entrepreneurship training developed by EINET (European network for education in entrepreneurship) which includes practical experience of founding an existing enterprise. It is provided at a 
number of colleges in collaboration with Innovation Norway, county municipalities and regional trade and 
industry. @BULLET JA-YE Norway provides the concept of  " Student Enterprise "  to universities and colleges and can be run for 12 months. @BULLET  " Innovation Net " : a network established by colleges which includes providing courses for employees and students in various subjects, notably entrepreneurship. @BULLET StartNorge: is an organisation for students who are interested in enterprise founding and innovation. It is meant to be a power center for students and has 10 local associations. @BULLET Business-oriented Educational Programme: established by the Norwegian Research Council. The programme intends to develop interplay between SMEs and state colleges to increase innovation and 
regional development capacity. The majority of Norway's counties have local and regional development programmes that include the 
promotion of entrepreneurship. Regional and local authorities support and fund different initiatives about 
10% of the funds for regional development were used for paving the way for entrepreneurship and the 
establishment of new enterprises in 2006. Funds have been allocated to partnerships between stakeholders 
such as the business sector, providers of teaching, educational institutions, municipalities and other 
organisations. III. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation Norway is known for its commitment to entrepreneurship policy as a major tool for spurring the birth 
and growth of firms. Given continual changes in consumer preferences, trade, technology, innovation and 
access to resources, entrepreneurship is rightly seen as a crucial element shaping an economy's adaptive 
and innovative capacity. A high per capita income country with relatively well functioning financial 64 The Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Oslo provides a number of courses in 
Entrepreneurship and innovation, for example: a Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship; a 
programme  " From Idea to Enterprise " ; a HUMSAM-Course on how to establish a business. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 93 markets, Norway has placed entrepreneurial education at the centre of its entrepreneurship policy, which 
itself is an integrated part of the 2003 Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy. Helped by favourable macro-economic conditions and low barriers to entrepreneurship, this policy 
approach has contributed to a rising entrepreneurial activity. This is evident in recent strong firm creation 
and high numbers of pupils and students taking courses in entrepreneurial education. Surveys show 
Norway being one of the most entrepreneurial countries in Europe, second only to Iceland in 2006. On firms level, entrepreneurial quality is partly reflected in the efficiency of manufacturing micro 
firms employing less than 10 persons. Compared to most other countries, Norway's micro firms exhibited 
high output shares relative to their respective firm population shares in 2001-2002 (Table 3.3). Micro firms 
represented 61% of manufacturing firms in 2002, the lowest OECD share after Ireland, but produced more 
than 6% of manufacturing output, one of the highest output shares (Annex 3.A, Table 3.A.1). The implicit 
efficiency ratio of 0.10 (output share divided by firm population share) was comparatively high. In 
contrast, small and medium-sized manufacturing firms (employing 10-249 persons) suffered from 
comparative disadvantages, efficiency levels lagging behind those of most other OECD countries 
(Table 3.3). Table 3.3 Efficiency ratio

those firms which were established in 2001 and survived until 2004, employed fewer than 20 employees. 
Particularly high survival rates were noted for small and micro-enterprises in construction, wholesale retail 
trade, repair, hotels, restaurants, financial intermediation, real estate, education, health and social work. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 94 New entrepreneurship policy initiatives taken over the past three years have maintained the 
momentum of spurring entrepreneurial and innovative activities. Highlights of these policy efforts have 
been increased networking and financing opportunities through SIVA, RCN and Innovation Norway. Stronger entrepreneurial activity through enlarged education opportunities Gauging direct effects of new policy initiatives is always difficult, policy lead times being long and 
varying with policy categories. Even so, it is striking to note that the percentage of the population of 
working age engaged in early-stage-entrepreneurial-activities (ESEA) increased strongly in 2005 and 2006 
after falling during the previous three years. The observed rise in ESEA was particularly strong for women, 
whose share in ESEA increased to 32% in 2006 from 25% a year earlier. Stronger ESEA trends also testify to the work of the Junior-Achievement-Young Enterprise (JA-YE) 
Norway, an organisation which assists government efforts to raise the supply of entrepreneurial education 
opportunities. According to a study made by the North Trondelag Research Institute in 2005, participants 
of the JA-YE's Company Programme display a much stronger propensity to start a business (16.6%) than 
the population in general (7.5%). Improved educational opportunities along with new tax provisions, 65 grants for start-ups and incubator 
use have contributed to the recent acceleration of firm creation, start-ups rising from 43 000 in 2004 to 
51 000 in 2006, an increase of 7 000 firms. This compares with a rise of 3 000 newly created firms in 
2001-2003. Increases in recent start-ups were particularly strong in financial intermediation, construction, 
transport, storage and communication, real estate and business services, social and personal services. 
Buoyant business start-ups also reflected a simplified regulatory setting, a consequence of the Simplifying 
Norway Action Plan (2002-2003). Stronger innovative activity through networks and better incentives In the domain of innovative activity, recent data point to similar, positive developments. After falling 
in the early years of the new millennium, the number of both patent applications and patents granted 
increased strongly between 2004 and 2006. Coincident recoveries are also noted for the number of 
applications and awards for trademarks and design. Private R&D spending, habitually low by international 
comparison, appears to have picked up. In varying degrees, these hopeful trends have been associated with several new innovation-oriented 
policy measures (see Box 3.1), including the Norwegian Centres of Excellence Scheme (2002) funded by 
the Norwegian Fund for Innovation and Research, Technology Transfer Offices at Norwegian Universities 
(2003), stronger rights for employees making inventions (2002), the tax credit scheme for R&D 
expenditure (Skattefunn) (2002), the Plan for a Comprehensive Innovation Policy (From Idea to value) 
(2003), units commercialising public R&D (FORNY programme, 2000) and Innovation Norway, a key 
institution emerging from the merger of four innovation-fostering institutions (2004). Nevertheless, there is 
room for more strongly exploiting geographical proximity as a means to group ISMEs and venture capital 
suppliers around universities and other research facilities (creation of technological 'hotbeds'). Offering better access to the full range of public support facilities, Innovation Norway has 
strengthened entrepreneurs' innovative activities. Entrepreneurial groups sponsored by Innovation Norway 65 There are elements in the tax system which have contributed to an increase in the number of start-ups in 
recent years. Dividends exceeding the normal rate of return are not taxed if they are given to another 
company. Dividends from companies to private persons, however, are taxed. In addition, the tax system 
provides incentives for persons to own property through companies. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 95 have integrated entrepreneurs into a network of 'peer entrepreneurs' offering social support as well as 
professional advice. In addition, activities performed by the SIVA have increased the range and quality of 
business support services. This has taken the form of larger numbers of business development centres 
(business development gardens) and business incubators. As a result, the networking infrastructure for 
industrial start-ups has improved. Progress in improving access to finance Signs suggesting easier access to finance are mixed. On the one hand, falling interest rates and risk 
premiums along with rising supplies of venture capital indicate low barriers to entrepreneurship finance. 
Yet recent surveys show entrepreneurs still citing lack of capital as the main obstacle for entrepreneurial 
activities. This may in part be an issue related to problems with business plans, or to the scalability of 
business ideas. Some potential investors indicate that there is not a lack of capital, but a lack of good ideas. 
At any rate, spreading best financial practices has become urgent in the light of the rising capital demand 
linked to stronger ESEA rates. This calls for a fluid financing continuum at all stages 66 of formal and 
informal finance before the entry into regulated capital markets. Access to equity capital may have become easier with the national and regional seed capital schemes. 
A similar effect may have resulted from Argentum, the government-owned fund-of-fund investor in the 
private equity market, which has released larger amounts of funds to establish an internationally 
competitive market for private equity. Recent data on larger supplies of venture capital rising from low 
levels validate these policy initiatives. Even so, the average amount invested by business angels has 
remained low by international comparison and the amount of seed capital remains inadequate. According to the recent OECD Economic Survey of Norway, the small amount of seed capital 
available for start-ups possibly reflects in part the restrictions on the class of assets that can be invested in 
by insurance companies and pension funds. The Survey recommends that these restrictions be relaxed. The 
Survey also argues that the borrowing conditionality for obtaining seed capital from Innovation Norway is 
too restrictive and that it could be lightened. In addition, given the relative efficiency of the Norwegian banking system and the plentiful 
availability of bank loans (including without collateral), it may not be justified to maintain the existing 
myriad of guarantee schemes. These should be phased out, as the corresponding government funds could 
be more productively used to further increase the availability of risk capital to entrepreneurs, including by 
expanding the network of business angels. In this context, the existing schemes that mix guarantees and co-
investment could also be simplified and re-focused. Concluding remarks While early signs of recent entrepreneurial policy action are encouraging, the need for a medium-
term, balanced strategy for entrepreneurship and SME policy remains strong. At the level of stakeholders, 
policy co-ordination does not seem to be a serious problem, but a certain streamlining of responsibilities 
(simplification) may be warranted to avoid duplication. This may require a systematic evaluation of policy 
programmes, which goes beyond the scope of this chapter. As far as co-ordination is concerned, special attention should be given to collective process innovation 
taking the form of improved vertical and horizontal networking among business support services, research 
institutions, universities and the business community, to overcome structural under-spending in private 
R&D. 66 OECD (2006), The SME Financing Gap. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 96 Interest in entrepreneurship can be kindled further by better targeting entrepreneurial education at 
university level. Moreover, as the number of social assistance beneficiaries is relatively high for a low-
unemployment country, initiatives and courses in entrepreneurship in adult education need to better target 
these beneficiaries with the goal of enlarging the pool of potential entrepreneurs. In this context, 
entrepreneurship education programmes could be better integrated with existing active labour market 
policies (vocational, counseling and other training programmes). Success in the educational domain will inevitably result in stronger demand for early-stage risk 
capital. Similar effects will flow from 'technological hotbeds' exploiting advantages of geographical 
proximity for research, investment and finance. New and better networking activity among suppliers of 
risk capital (investors' clubs, business angels network, etc.) will help increase access to finance. Taken 
together, the proposed policy measures will eventually equip Norway with an entrepreneurial infrastructure 
that will increase its capacity to meet future challenges. Box 3.4 Policy recommendations Enlarge entrepreneurship opportunities Strengthen entrepreneurship education at university level with better targeted programmes

growth among OECD countries. Catching-up gains notwithstanding, Turkey's GDP per capita is still 
comparatively low (around 30% of the Euro zone). The root of continued underperformance is low overall 
productivity, reflecting dismal efficiency levels in the sector of small and micro firms. In contrast, large 
and medium-sized firms, benefiting from international partnerships and competition, are highly efficient. 
This points to a highly skewed distribution of productivity performance across business categories. In this setting, the creation and enlargement of firms is increasingly seen as a major potential agent 
driving innovation and productivity enhancement. Over the past few years, entrepreneurship policies have 
been correspondingly adapted to strengthen entrepreneurial activities including at the pre-start, start-up and 
post start-up phase of business life. The link between entrepreneurship policy and innovation is, by nature, indirect. Efficient measures of 
entrepreneurship policy underpin firm creation and growth, and in doing so they invigorate innovative 
activity. Policy lead times though, vary with the type of entrepreneurship policy. Introducing 
entrepreneurship education in schools and universities is bound to affect innovation trends only in the long 
run. The same is true of easing cultural biases against entrepreneurial activities. In contrast, more 
immediate effects may spring from dismantling barriers to finance as well as setting up well-focused 
training courses for both subsistence entrepreneurs and business counsellors (teachers' training 
programmes). Viewed from a wider angle, entrepreneurship policy itself may constitute an 'innovation', 
augmenting the effects which firm creation and firm expansion normally have on individual innovations. The first part of this chapter highlights salient features of Turkey's firm population, identifies main 
impediments to entrepreneurial activity and presents indicators of entrepreneurship performance. The 
second part outlines main objectives of entrepreneurship policy and describes principal programmes in four 
major areas of policy intervention: access to R&D and new technology, access to finance, capabilities and 
access to skilled labour and cultural values. The third and final part provides an evaluation of 
entrepreneurship and SME policies. I. 
Main features of the enterprise sector and impediments to firm creation 1. 
Main features of the enterprise sector Turkey's enterprise sector is marked by two major asymmetries. Small and medium-sized firms 
(SMEs) constitute the near-totality of all firms (99.6% in 2002) displaying one of the highest degrees of 
predominance among OECD countries. While SMEs represent three-quarters of total employment in 2002 
(77%), they account for only one-quarter of total output (27%). Only about one-third of Turkey's SMEs in 
export. In contrast, a tiny number of large enterprises (employing more than 250 persons) generate nearly DSTI/DOC(2008)5 106 three-quarter of value added (73%) with a work force equal to one-quarter of total employment (23%) 
(Table 4.1). 67 Table 4.1 Output and employment shares 2002 (in %) Output share

34 Source: Turkstat. The second asymmetry concerns the SME sector itself. As is normal for a country with a large 
agricultural sector and a correspondingly low per capita income, micro firms (with less than 10 persons) 
constitute 96% of SMEs (2002). Making up 34% of total employment, micro firms, produce no more than 
8% of overall output. In contrast, SMEs (excluding micro firms) representing less than 5% of all 
enterprises produce around 19% of overall value added, while absorbing 43% of total employment. In manufacturing, SMEs are similarly predominant, around 246 000 micro firms coexisting with only 
1 100 large enterprises (with more than 250 persons) and 25 600 SMEs (employing more than 9 persons 
and less than 250 persons) in 2002 (Table 4.2). Turkey's proportion of micro firms in manufacturing (90%) 
is among the highest in the OECD area, far exceeding shares recorded by high-income countries such as 
the United States, Germany and Norway (around 60%). The average size of SMEs in manufacturing is 
small (4.8 persons in 2003) and even smaller for micro firms (3.1 persons). Overall, Turkey's firm 
population (excluding rural enterprises and individual farmers) totalled 2 million in 2004, service and 
manufacturing enterprises accounting, respectively, for 86% and 14% of the firm population. 67 TURKSTAT data put the average age of manufacturing and service enterprises at nearly 9 years in 2002. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 107 Table 4.2 Output and employment shares in manufacturing 2002 Number of firms

27 Note: Large firms are defined here as firms with over 150 employees; Micro firms as firms between 0 and 9 employees. Source: Turkstat (2002). The economy-wide and manufacturing data shown above reveal huge gaps in productivity levels 
across three major categories of firms: @BULLET Large firms (> 250 employees) are highly efficient by both international and Turkish standards. 
Their entrepreneurial presence, though, is weak. There are only 910 large enterprises in 
manufacturing compared with 3 000 large manufacturing firms in Mexico, another low per capita 
income country. Large firms in the formal sector have a robust physical and human capital base. 
Being well connected to international markets and partners, they have been able to achieve strong 
productivity gains over the past five years. @BULLET Medium-sized firms (MSEs) (50-249 employees) excluding small firms and micro firms, are less 
productive than large firms. But helped by vibrant entrepreneurship, MSEs have been the most 
dynamic component of Turkey's business sector over the past decade. MSEs operate in all 
manufacturing and service activities, and particularly in tradable sectors such as textiles, clothing, 
metal working, machinery, food and furniture. They have grown in the traditional industrial 
centres of Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa and, more typically, in a range of Anatolian towns (Denizli, 
Gaziantep, Kayseri and Eskisehir). Organised industrial zones established in these towns have 
provided the infrastructure for exceptionally fast output growth. Because of their ability to 
nurture a large population of high-growth firms, these towns have been dubbed 'Anatolian 
Tigers'. @BULLET Micro firms (< 10 employees), which are dominant in agriculture and numerous in clothing, 
metal working, food industries, retail trade, construction and transportation, are grossly 
inefficient by both national and international standards. Their biggest handicap is weak human 
capital stock and a deficient equity base. Many micro firms have no other regular employees than 
their family members. In France, Italy and Portugal, micro firms' output share is nearly twice as 
high as in Turkey, while their weight in the firm population is much lower. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 108 Figure 4.1. The skewed distribution of labour mobilisation and labour productivity 1. OECD estimates. 2. Share of formal and informal sector workers in the working age population with given educational background. Source: OECD Economic Surveys, Turkey, 2006 based on data from TURKSTAT, SPO. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 109 The productivity gap is also large between formal and informal enterprises. Half-formal firms have 
achieved a significant catching-up in the past decade and are now at an intermediate level of efficiency 
(Figure 4.1). A large part of Turkey's working force is active in the informal economy which produces 
roughly one half of formal SMEs' value added. The scale of informal activities is negatively correlated 
with the size of firms as well with the level of educational attainment. No less than three-quarters of micro firms have regular recourse to informal activities as against one 
tenth of medium-sized firms. 68 Agriculture, where micro firms abound, is almost entirely informal, 
employing one third of the work force at depressed levels of productivity. Many high-growth MSEs are 
partly engaged in informal activities, using contracting-out procedures to avoid the full burden of formality 
(semi-informal firms). In contrast, large firms appear to be firmly anchored in formal activities. The three tiers of efficiency levels thus point to major imbalances of entrepreneurial activity. There is 
an 'oversupply' of ineffective subsistence entrepreneurship and a correspondingly strong lack of efficient 
growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity. This dichotomy shows up in both a high self-employment rate 
and a large regional dispersion of GDP per capita. Both indicators top levels shown by other OECD 
countries in 2001 (Figures 4.2 and 4.3). Reflecting population distribution, more than 80% of SMEs are 
located in four major regions (Marmara, Aegean Sea, Central Anatolia and the Mediterranean coastal 
region), the remaining SMEs being present in the Black Sea region and in South-Eastern and Eastern 
Anatolia. Labour market conditions are marked by low activity rates (around 75% for men, 28% for women and 
a combined average of 52% in 2002). More than half of dependently employed women (5.5 million 
women) are unpaid family workers, most of them working in agriculture. Female entrepreneurial activity is

Factors driving firm creation and expansion A set of chronic impediments hamper firm creation, including lack of new technology, R&D benefits, 
finance, skilled labour and business services. These constraints are particularly severe for small and micro 
firms, weighed down by an under endowment of both tangible and intangible capital. The main 
impediment faced by large firms and MSEs is a heavy regulatory framework in the formal economy, which 
is way out of line with international standards. MSEs operating in the grey zone of semi-formality are hindered by lack of transparency, reducing the 
flow of credit and capital funds at affordable cost. Small and micro firms compensate a thin resource base 
with benefits from illegal activities (low operating costs and low entry and exit costs), while facing rising 
domestic and international competition. According to partial and anecdotal evidence, many micro firms 
have recently gone out of business, reducing employment in both tradable and non-tradable activities. 69 
This points to deepening structural handicaps. a) Access to new technology and R&D benefits While rapid progress has been made since the inception of the customs union with the EU in 1996, 
investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) has remained low (Table 4.3). SMEs' 
awareness of e-business offering profitable business opportunities is still low. While Turkey's large 69 OECD (2006), Economic Surveys Turkey. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 111 companies reached parity with the EU in terms of Internet access in 2005 (99%), SMEs' access lagged far 
behind, the gap being negatively correlated with firm class size. Moreover, even though more than 
three-fifths of SMEs (excluding micro firms) have a computer, the size of the information and technology 
sector amounted to only 0.8% of GDP as against 3.3% for the EU15 average. Thus, the usage of ICT, 
though rising, has left so far no marked impact on SMEs' competitive position. 70 The depressed state of 
technology has its main roots in weak innovative activity which is variously ascribed to: @BULLET An extremely low ratio of R&D expenditure to GDP (0.8% in 2005). R&D personnel as a share 
of total employment is still among the lowest in OECD countries notwithstanding a sharp rise in 
the number of full-time equivalent R&D personnel per 10 000 total employment over the past 
few years. Most R&D employees work for universities as distinct from research institutions. 
Most developed countries display the opposite constellation. @BULLET Insufficient R&D efforts in the private sector. The share of the business sector in total R&D 
expenditure is low (around 34% as against the OECD average of 65%) mainly reflecting limited 
awareness of potential benefits flowing from R&D activities. The number of SMEs carrying out 
high-technology based activities is low. The co-operation between academia, public institutions 
and industry is weak. Benefits from public research activities are rarely commercialised, while 
industry's needs tend to be overlooked. Most research proposals originate in large cities in the 
Western part of the country where most research centres and laboratories are located. @BULLET Inadequate funding for co-operative projects at universities, research laboratories and equipment. 
Despite a university-based intellectual potential, university-industry interactions have remained 
weak. @BULLET Lack of finance for innovations and R&D. Tax incentives have been modest, most of the support 
going to large firms. Table 4.3. Diffusion of Information and Communication Technology 1 Mexico

Source: OECD, SMEs in Mexico, 2007 based on the OECD Communications Outlook, 2005. 70 Ministry of Industry and Trade, Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme, November 2007. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 112 Thanks to partnerships and financial linkages with multinational companies, large firms generally 
have quick access to new technology, R&D benefits and best practices. Some infrastructure costs, though, 
related to information technology, are high by international comparison. Turkey still records far the highest 
broadband prices per Mbit/s in the OECD area. By contrast, technological deficiency is acute for small and 
micro firms, which suffer from shortages of human capital and financial resources, poorly functioning 
markets and lack of understanding. In this setting, entrepreneurial demand for business support services 
has remained low. There are signs of modest progress, though, R&D spending rising to 0.8% of GDP in 
2005 from 0.61% in 2003. Moreover, the number of Turkish scientists' publications has risen sharply, 
reaching nearly 14 000 in 2004 compared with 9 300 in 2002. b) Access to finance Real interest rates, though sharply declining since 2001, have remained high by international 
comparison. Turkey's short-term and long-term real interest rates averaged 8.3% in 2007 (Table 4.4) as 
against 4.6% for Mexico, a country with a comparable per-capita income, and 2% for the Euro area. 
Official interest rates naturally represent a floor (minimum rates), with only a few large, top-graded 
companies being able to borrow funds at this cost. For the overwhelming majority of other firms, real 
interest rates are much higher, implying steep required rates of return on planned investment. The 
unusually high level of capital user cost reflects both inefficient financial markets and a large current 
account deficit of the balance of payments. The large excess of imports over exports (7.5% of GDP in 
2007) necessitates high internal interest rates so as to attract capital inflows on a scale which maintain 
relative exchange rate stability. A lack of formal credit funds and equity capital at affordable cost thus constitutes a severe constraint 
to firm creation and firm expansion. Most banks refrain from making loans to SMEs reflecting the 
government's dominant lender position and the lack of banking skills to underwrite such loans effectively. 
As a result, less than 5% of available bank credit has been provided to industrial SMEs, which, as shown 
above, account for no less than 99.5% of all industrial establishments. Despite rebounding credits to the 
private sector following the banking crisis of 2000-01, most banks still lack basic expertise of how to lend 
funds to SMEs. Table 4.4 Real short-term and long-term interest rates (2007) Short-term interest rate

2.0 Note: Real interest rates are nominal interest rates deflated by the GDP deflators. Source: OECD Economic Outlook, June 2007. As informal firms' financial accounts understate the true dimension of their activities, SMEs find it 
difficult to win support from properly supervised banks. In the past, Turkish banks used to provide 
informal and semi-informal firms with a limited amount of credit through a system of informal books and 
bilateral information. Dynamic medium-sized enterprises (MSEs) still refrain from making ample use of 
formal banking and financial services, formal credit costs being high, while benefits from informal 
operations continue to be substantial. These enterprises are funded, to a large extent, by own-equity and 
inter-enterprise trade credit, which serve as the main financing channels. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 113 MSEs' semi-informality is likely to become a serious hindrance in communication with other partners 
such as joint-venture candidates, technology suppliers and new customers. Standard banking and financial 
services will be increasingly needed, as the demand for and the potential supply of medium-to-long-term 
investment credit is bound to rise rapidly. Enterprises' investment for modernisation and long-term asset-
building implies increased demand for such funding. Recent entries of prime international banks have 
widened the range of financial instruments for large firms and MSEs, 71 thus easing barriers to finance. In 
contrast, micro firms' access to finance is severely restricted by high costs of suppliers' credits, lack of 
banks' ability to conduct small loan-operations and shortages of micro financial instruments backed by 
government guarantees. There is no comprehensive micro-loan mechanism operating in Turkey. A 2005 survey of  " Small Enterprise Finance in Turkey "  (653 firms) conducted by Bankakadmie 
International with the support of the EU and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (Germany) revealed 
stringent collateral requirements by commercial banks as being the most important barrier to finance (83% 
of firms) followed by  " excessively high interest rates "  (54% of firms) and cumbersome bureaucratic 
procedures (26%). As a result, SMEs, especially in manufacturing, find it difficult to obtain sufficient 
capital for their investment projects, notably in the start-up phase. Lack of start-up capital is seen as a 
fundamental bottleneck for firm creation, SMEs having difficulties in providing required guarantees or 
collateral. Insufficient capital appears to be the fundamental bottleneck for start-ups. There are only two operational venture capital investment trusts, ISRISK, a private company founded 
in 2001 and KOBI, a public incorporated company acting as an efficient risk capital intermediary which 
provides financial instruments to promising SMEs. The number of SMEs using venture capital is estimated 
at 2%, a low number by international standards. Moreover, for credit guarantees, there is only one 
organisation, the Credit Guarantee Fund Operating Research J.S.C. (KGF). Operating in Turkey since 
1994,. KGF, an intermediary organisation, permits SMEs with inadequate collaterals to apply for bank 
credits reducing banks' risks and increasing the number of their customers. A comprehensive system of 
micro-finance does not exist in Turkey. Thanks to the financial reform process, which began in 2001, financial institutions (banks, factoring 
and leasing companies) appear to have become more willing to provide funds for SMEs, contributing to the 
rise in the ratio of credits to GDP to 41% in 2006 from 23% in 2002. The volume of factoring and leasing 
also increased, reaching, respectively, EUR 12 billion and EUR 4 billion in 2006. Overall, though, 
financial institutions still view SME financing as being risky, yielding little profit. Supply and demand side 
obstacles SME finance still reflect ineffective and insufficient numbers of financial instruments. 72 c) Access to skilled labour and business services While recent decades have seen a swift expansion of access to school education, the quality of 
education remains low at the majority of schools. 73 Education opportunities are unevenly distributed as the 
education system focuses on good quality education for the most able students. Resources being skewed 
towards the 'high end', the education system favours students from higher-income families who, after 
university graduation, join the formal economy as employees. In this setting, the most binding human 
capital deficiencies are to be found at the middle and low ends of the labour market. The stock of under-
educated adults is large, adversely affecting entrepreneurial activities of small and micro firms. While 
opportunities for receiving entrepreneurship education and adult training opportunities are sparse, cultural 71 OECD (2006), Economic Surveys Turkey. 72 Ministry of Industry and Trade, Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme, November 2007. 73 OECD (2006), Economic Surveys Turkey. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 114 factors hinder peoples' propensity to choose entrepreneurship as a career. This is especially true for women 
whose participation in entrepreneurial activity is extremely low. On the level of micro firms, the under endowment of human capital is the primary factor, shutting out 
innovative activities and perpetuating low efficiency levels. On the level of MSEs semi-formality and lack 
of funds often prevent purchases of high-quality managerial services and business services capable of 
diffusing best-practice technology. High-skilled managers themselves avoid reputational and legal risks 
associated with running semi-formal companies. Access to business services supplied by public or private support units is constrained by chronic 
demand deficiency. This varously reflects reduced visibility of available services and relatively high cost 
for private counselling. The small average size of Turkish SMEs and, in particular, the large proportion of 
micro firms, may contribute to these failings of the markets for support services. 74 Opportunities for 
receiving entrepreneurship education per se are sparse. II. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies 1. 
Overall aims of entrepreneurship and SME policies For many years, Turkey's entrepreneurship and SME policies has been geared towards enhancing 
productivity and competitiveness through spurring R&D spending, innovation and the diffusion of ICT. In 
2002 new programmes and funding schemes were designed to this effect. These support programmes 
focused on industry, often leaving out service activity. A broader industrial foundation was viewed as 
being critical for both stronger international integration and reduced regional imbalances. Entrepreneurship and SME policies in Turkey have been shaped over the past few years by a number 
of factors (Box 4.1), including: @BULLET The creation in 1996 of the Customs Union with the European Union. As a result, Turkish 
industry became increasingly exposed to international competition, while SME support 
programmes began to be designed within a framework of international co-operation. @BULLET The ratification in 2002 of the European Charter for Small Enterprises which established an 
international framework for conducting efficient SME policies. By adopting the EU-Charter for 
SMEs, Turkey pledged to take concrete steps to conceive programmes and projects in all 
important SME policy areas, including on-line access, access to finance and access to education 
and training for entrepreneurs. Turkey considers the Charter as the foundation for its long-term 
SME strategy (medium-term to long-term enterprise (SME) development strategy). 75 @BULLET Establishment of the EU-legal framework for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (2006), 76 (Annex

plans, which present a general policy framework. More detailed policy objectives are laid out in medium-
term (three-year) programmes, while annual programmes identify specific policy measures, a time frame 
and the allocation of responsibilities among different government branches and other policy stakeholders. 
Highlights of entrepreneurship and SME policy over the past few years included: @BULLET The five-year National Convergence Programme to the EU acquis (2001-05). Aimed at 
improving SMEs' efficiency and competitiveness, the plan promoted the diffusion of best-
practices to upgrade product quality and innovation and technology capacity through modern 
management techniques, new financial instruments and partnerships with universities and foreign 
companies. The plan also called for better service delivery to SMEs creating and expanding 
specialised support units (service stations). @BULLET The Urgent Action Plan adopted by the High Planning Council in November 2003. The 
implementation of this plan, prepared in the context of EU pre-accession, is one of the priorities 77 The Istanbul OECD Ministerial Declaration was adopted after the 2 nd OECD Ministerial conference on 
 " Promoting Entrepreneurship and Innovative SMEs in a Global Economy " . DSTI/DOC(2008)5 116 of the SME Charter of the 2003 Turkish National Programme for the adoption of the EU acquis. 
The purpose of the plan was to raise the transparency of existing policies and programmes; to 
define clearly the respective responsibilities for public and private organisations and to identify a 
set of required activities. The plan was prepared by the SME Study Group composed of various 
organisations mapping out SME strategies. @BULLET The Specific Action Plan for 2004-06. This plan was geared towards buttressing industrial SMEs 
by raising their level of technology, enlarging the flow of financial funds and augmenting the 
quality of their products. Implementing this plan has been facilitated by a new consultative 
committee involving private-sector representatives who work in unison with the State Planning 
Organisation (SPO). 2. 
A new framework for entrepreneurship and SME policies a) 
The 9 th Development Plan (2007-2013) A new phase of entrepreneurship and SME policies has opened up with the adoption in 2007 of the 9 th 
Development Plan covering the period 2007-2013. This plan focuses on stronger R&D spending and 
innovation as indispensable structural tools to bolster the business sector. Aimed at lifting R&D spending 
to 2% of GDP in 2010 from 0.8% in 2005 the plan envisages the upgrading and expansion of the R&D 
infrastructure. To this end, public research institutes will be strengthened and private research centres 
established. Academic R&D activities will be increasingly oriented towards industrial needs implying 
stronger collaborative links between universities and industry. The Plan also intends to complete the 
building of Technology Development Zones (TDZs) and to create Technology Transfer Centres. Financial 
underpinning of these projects is scheduled to come from new financial instruments capable of expanding 
scarce supplies of venture capital for innovative SMEs (ISMEs) and high-growth SMEs (HGSMEs). 
Innovative firms striving to overcome pressure from foreign low-cost competition will benefit from special 
incentives. The 9 th Development Plan also embodies a special strategy for balanced regional development. Aimed 
at reducing stark regional disparities through stronger regional competitiveness the Plan adopts a 'Growth 
Centres Approach'. Under this approach, geographical areas with a high-growth potential are identified, 
mainly inside less-developed regions. The main function of such growth centres is to install a balanced 
physical and social infrastructure capable of generating new industrial 'focal points'. According to the 
Plan, such infrastructural 'magnets' will eventually attract investment from both outside the region and 
from outside Turkey. This 'Growth Centres Approach' is also integrated into the Strategic Coherence 
Framework as agreed by the EU-Commission in June 2007. Accordingly, the SME Strategy and Action Plan (2007-2009), covering the first three-year segment of 
the 9 th Development Plan, focuses on lending support to new, innovative and competitive enterprises, 
correcting past programme failures and a more stringent monitoring of policy outcomes. The plan singles 
out several priority areas, including entrepreneurship development, firm creation, integration of SMEs into 
international markets and national and international networks, improvement of the business environment, 
diversification of financial instruments and expansion of technological and innovative capacity. In pursuit 
of this aim, the plan offers training programmes for SMEs, encouraging them to participate in European 
Technology Platforms. It also supports post-graduate studies of industry at university level Industrial 
Thesis Supporting Programme (SANTEZ Project) and prepares the conversion of technology 'incubators 
without walls' into technology development centres. The 9 th Development Plan and the SME Strategy and Action Plan have been shaped in line with the 
2006 EU legal framework governing pre-accession assistance (Annex 4.A). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 117 3. 
Principal stakeholders of entrepreneurship and SME policies The government's main tool for implementing industrial entrepreneurship policy has been KOSGEB, 
(Small and Medium Industry Development Organisation), a Public Agency affiliated with the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade. Established by law in 1990 and subject to private law in all its transactions, 
KOSGEB's mandate is to increase the weight and effectiveness of industrial SMEs and raise their 
competitiveness. In line with this mandate, KOSGEB has designed numerous support programmes to 
enhance technological skills, stimulate entrepreneurship, upgrade labour skills, spur R&D efforts and 
disseminate information which is relevant to SMEs. Programmes are developed by different directorates 
within KOSGEB and they are implemented by the Enterprise Development Centers (IGEMs), the 
Technology Development Centers (TEKMERs) and the Synergy Focal Points (Box 4.2). In 2007, 
KOSGEB employed 651 persons. Public expenditure associated with its programmes totalled 
TYL 10 582 112 in 2007. KOSGEB's TEKMERs act as incubators providing support for technology development through 
know-how, material, equipment and office space. They have been established through protocols signed 
between KOSGEB and universities and chambers of commerce; they service both start-ups and existing 
innovative SMEs. In the areas where TEKMERs do not exist 'business incubators without walls' provide 
services to SMEs, excluding office allocation. IGEMs are mainly established in organised industrial zones 
and provide services to manufacturing SMEs. 'Synergy Focuses' have been launched in 2004 to generalise services and assistance given to SMEs. 
Exemplifying a new co-operation model (collaborative innovation) 'Synergy Focuses' are established in 
co-operation with the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB), Unions of 
Artisans, Cooperatives of Artisans, Management Boards of Organised Industrial Zones (OIZ) and Small 
Scale Industrial Estates (SSIE) as well as with SME foundations and associations. Box 4.2.

Party on SMEs and Entrepreneurship (WPSMEE). DSTI/DOC(2008)5 118 Other government branches involved in industrial entrepreneurship and SME policy include the 
Undersecretariat of the Treasury which is responsible for State aid for SME investment. The Under 
Secretariat of Foreign Trade helps deploy programmes to spur SME creation. Business organisations such 
as the TOBB and the Confederation of Tradesmen and Artisans of Turkey (TESK) play an important role in 
implementing SME policies. Other non-governmental organisations involved in innovation-oriented 
entrepreneurship and SME policy include the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV). 4. 
Strengthening entrepreneurial and innovative activities a) 
Better access to new technology, R&D benefits and networking activities A key element in Turkey's efforts to raise the level of enterprises' technology has been the expansion 
and deepening of services support programmes, including a better adaptation of research activities to 
business needs. Five main stakeholders are active in this field: the Ministry of Industry and Trade, 
KOSGEB, the State Planning Organisation (SPO), the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey 
(TTGV) and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). KOSGEB's 
programmes, notably those applied by Enterprise Development Centres and Technology Development 
Centres, are based upon best practice models from Europe, Asia and North America. Various 'services 
stations' provide a broad range of support services to new and existing small businesses in manufacturing 
which strive to augment output, marketing and export capacity. Under KOSGEB's programmes, small firms have access to managerial and technical assistance, 
capital space, R&D benefits and management training. In addition, they receive subsidies for recruiting and 
managing personnel. In 2006, 2 767 small enterprises received assistance from both types of centres. 
Public spending related to these activities amounted to TYK 15 187 258. TEKMER staff, a total of 
53 SME experts, provide consulting assistance, acting as guides to outside resources and not as direct 
service providers per se. Teaching entrepreneurs how to access support services and convincing them to make use of 
technological assistance is the most important function performed by TEKMERs. 78 They also help 
establish better relationships between SMEs and technology service providers which are predominantly 
public organisations. To strengthen the interaction between SMEs and universities, TEKMERs and 
business incubators have begun to be established near universities. Currently, there are 20 TEKMERs 
located in university campuses. Three of them are located in less-developed regions (NUTSII regions) 
supporting 110 firms. In addition there are 7 'incubators without walls' located in Industrial Zones and 
along with TEKMERs they support about 1 400 R&D projects. Private companies (Ericsson, Koc Holding 
and Siemens) have established business incubators of their own. Another programme creating ties between academia and the business sector is SANTEZ. This 
programme sponsors graduate studies based upon requests by industry and stimulates the transmutation of 
invention into innovation through innovation-oriented SMEs. Financial support of up to 75% of the project 
budget is provided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade while the rest is covered by the company 
commercialising the output. In addition, Technology Development Zones (TDZs) have been created to help bridge the gap 
between research activity and business needs. TDZs promote the use of high/advanced technologies and 
related R&D capabilities through co-operation between universities, research institutes and the productive 
sector. Financial support is granted for land, infrastructure and construction of management buildings. 78 OECD (2004), Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Turkey, Issues and Policies, p. 63. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 119 TDZs benefit from tax exemptions and incentives until 2014. There are 28 TDZs in Turkey of which 18 are 
operational. They are mainly established by universities. Currently, nearly 800 firms are linked to TDZs 
(99% of SMEs) and over 2 500 R&D projects are underway. Another stakeholder building links between universities, research centres and enterprises is the State 
Planning Organisation (SPO) which issues guidelines for research, technology, development and 
innovation. The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) implements 
programmes to strengthen the collaboration between industry and the research community: ISBAB 
supports initiatives to establish scientific and technological cooperation networks. EUREKA provides 
R&D network assistance for the 'Support Program for R&D Projects Market Platform'. Other TUBITAK 
programmes stimulate private R&D efforts and start-ups of innovation-oriented SMEs (TEKNOGISIM). KOSGEB has also taken action to increase the flow of advisory services from professional 
organisations and public institutions (universities) so as to create stronger links between SMEs and large 
enterprises. This is being achieved through novel incentive mechanisms inducing SMEs to take advantage 
of information and experience gathered by universities. TDCs and Chambers of Industry assist actual and 
potential entrepreneurs to make use of both business incubators without walls and Innovation Relay 
Centres (IRC). IRCs (a total of two, in 2007 Anatolia IRC and Ege IRC) have been incorporated into the 
EU-IRC Network. Networking activity has also been strengthened with the creation of Synergy focal points 
' intermediate service stations' placed between KOSGEB and TOBB. Sectoral networking activity by NGOs has been intensified with the 'Fashion and Textile Cluster' 
(2003), an EU-funded project launched by the Istanbul Textile and Apparel Exporters' Association 
(ITKIP). The 2007 RCOP stimulates the formation of sectoral clustering and inter-regional network 
building in the 12 NUTSII regions. The networking 'technology' (collective process innovation) is based 
upon results from EU-funded clustering and research projects, (GAP GIDEM, and SME development 
project) executed by UNDP in conjunction with GAP Regional Development Administration for sectors 
like marble, textile, confection and organic agriculture. The Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV) – a non-governmental independent not 
for profit organisation in the science and research sector – also supports projects from the corporate sector. 
The Foundation funds projects of Technoparks, TEKMERs, venture capital funds, start-up funds and joint 
technology development projects. It has also supported the commercialisation of R&D activities and risk 
sharing. TTGV has provided USD 165 million to 473 technology development projects. b) 
Better access to finance Several targeted investment credit programmes serve to reduce user cost of capital and to overcome 
the banking system's chronic inability to provide sufficient funds for SMEs. These programmes include: @BULLET Release of funds by the Treasury to the Halk Bank, the Industrial Development Bank and other 
banks. Loan parameters are established by agreement with the banks, the banks underwriting 
loans and taking responsibility for defaults. @BULLET Following the signature of a protocol between KOSGEB, HalkBank Vakifbank and Ziraat Bank 
in 2003, KOSGEB subsidises interest rates of credits provided by these banks. Under these 
protocols, soft loans are extended to SMEs beset by short-term liquidity problems. While the 
loans are accorded by banks, interest expenses are financed partially or fully by KOSGEB. In

purchasing or producing fixed assets subject to depreciation with a value of more than 
TKL 5 million. The State Aid Programme for SME investment is implemented by the Under 
Secretariat of the Treasury. @BULLET KOSGEB's financial incentives for business start ups of up to the equivalent of EUR 10 000 for 
fixed investment and operating expenses. Capital funds for fixed investment up to EUR 8 000 
must be paid back. Capital funds for operating expenses (up to EUR 2 000) do not have to be 
paid back. Technological business start ups receive stronger financial support. Funds for fixed 
investment must be repaid over a 4-year period, usually with a 1 year grace period. Start ups in 
less-developed areas benefit from longer grace periods and more favourable repayment 
schedules. Non-payback support is granted for counselling, R&D applications, publication of 
R&D findings, leasing space in techno parks and export promotion purposes. @BULLET Exemption of import duties and value-added tax payments for investment in equipment. @BULLET Under the SME Finance Facility bank credits have been extended to SMEs located in 
development areas at attractive interest rates. Surprisingly, the credit line provided by the 
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau has been underused. Banks have also lent funds to SMEs under 
the Small Enterprise Loan Programme (SELP) concentrating on small loans with a maturity of 
over a year. The SELP programme has had a noticeable impact on local economies and 
secondary markets, enabling 2 300 job creations and saving 15 300 jobs. 79 @BULLET In 2007, the  " Basel II "  prudential rules have been implemented augmenting the transparency of 
MSEs' financial accounts. This is expected to stimulate supplies of long-term credits and venture 
capital. Credit guarantees for SMEs are mainly provided by KGF, the Credit Guarantee Fund, and 
TESKOMB, the Union of Turkish Artisans and Craftsmen Credit Cooperatives. Established in 1994, KGF, 
an intermediary organisation, enables access to credit for SMEs with inadequate collateral. In 2005, KGF 
granted EUR 82 million worth of guarantees for 982 firms, mostly manufacturing firms (85%), while 5% 
of total guarantees were extended to firms located in the Eastern Anatolian region. The amount of 
guaranteed credit per unit of manufacturing firm population (EUR 410) is low. TESKOMB, an umbrella 
organisation covering 921 Artisan and Craftsmen Credit and Guarantees Cooperatives, offers guarantees 
for credits extended by Halbank. About 12% of artisan and craftsmen enterprises benefit from this 
guarantee. To reduce financial barriers for SMEs in less-developed regions, the IPA – RCOP (2007-2013) 
(Annex 4.A) intends to establish and support micro-loan funds and equity finance mechanisms, including 
venture capital funds, seed capital and start-up capital in the manufacturing and the tourist sector. Advisory 
and consultancy services are scheduled to enhance the effects of these measures. 79 Ministry of Industry and Trade, RCOP 2007, p. 44. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 121 Venture capital is supplied by KOBI and ISRISK, venture capital investment trusts. KOBI, a public 
incorporated company, acts as a risk capital intermediary offering a range of financial instruments for 
ISMEs and HSMEs. ISRISK is a private company established in 2001. c) 
Better access to entrepreneurship education and training To upgrade entrepreneurial labour, KOSGEB, through its IGEMs and TEKMERs, operates a number 
of employment support programmes. Both types of centres offer managerial and technical assistance for 
hiring skilled labour. Public funds cover 60% of labour cost in developed regions for 12-18 months. Firms 
located in less-developed regions receive a higher employment subsidy (80% of labour cost). KOSGEB 
applies strict rules for maximum salaries to be paid for newly hired skilled labour. Technology-based 
companies with R&D activities receive special training support from TEKMERs to absorb new software 
and information services. In parallel, KOSGEB's Centre for Entrepreneurship seeks to spur entrepreneurial activity by releasing 
information about potentially viable business opportunities. Using market research findings which it has 
sponsored or conducted the centre makes the information available through the network of IGEMs, 
TEKMERs, OIZs and SSIEs. In addition, the centre systematically reviews and documents successful 
business practices for inclusion in the KOBINET project, the SME network. The aim is here to stimulate 
entrepreneurs' use of the Internet, inviting them to enter e-commerce. KOSGEB's programme for business start ups offers two types of training. General educational 
services are supplied through KOSGEB's facilities dealing with basic managerial and technical issues. 
Specialised training is provided by professional organisations (public or private) for entrepreneurial 
activities not covered by KOSGEB's courses. The support ratio for general and special training is 
regionally differentiated. KOSGEB covers up to 100% of the cost for general education services and up to 
80% and EUR 3 500 per firm for specialised training. In 2004-2007, more than 15 000 persons received vocational training through KOSGEB's EU-Media 
Projects on Clothing and Shoe Making. Thanks to this training, about 2 500 persons were able to find 
employment. III. 
Entrepreneurship and SME policies and their impact upon firm creation and innovation In its 2004 peer review of Turkish policies aimed at SMEs, the OECD deplored the general lack of 
crucial elements for a proper policy evaluation. 80 At that time, Turkey had no exhaustive statistical census 
of firms on the basis of homogenous definitions and criteria. Large numbers of firms in the informal 
economy escaped investigation. Moreover, little was known about the cost of the support programmes for 
SMEs. Some estimates for direct budgetary costs were available, but indirect costs caused by tax 
allowances were hard to quantify. Last, but not least, large segments of the economy, such as tourism and 
services, lay outside the scope of specific support policies. Four years later, at the time of writing, most of these impediments are still hindering a proper, detailed 
policy assessment. Broad indicators, though, point to significant progress having been made over the past 
few years. This is manifest in better access to new technology, stronger R&D spending, rising numbers of 
R&D personnel, improved business support services and networking facilities (collaborative innovations) 
and enlarged business training opportunities. 80 OECD (2004), Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Turkey, Issues and Policies, p.7-8. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 122 In terms of Internet access, Turkey's large firms have reached parity with the EU in 2005. R&D 
expenditure, albeit still low by international standards, has risen to 0.8% of GDP in 2005. The range of 
KOSGEB's support and research centres has widened, triggering welcome interactions between research 
centres, universities and the business sector (synergy focal points, TEKMERs, IGEMs, TDZs, and 
'business incubators without walls'). Finally, the number of entrepreneurial training beneficiaries and 
training instructors has strongly increased, auguring stronger entrepreneurial and innovative activity. Looking ahead, the recent strong internationalisation of Turkey's entrepreneurship and SME policies 
is destined to strongly stimulate innovative activity. The opening of EU-accession negotiations (2004), the 
establishment of an EU legal framework for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (2006) and the alignment of 
SME support programmes on EU definitions (2006) are certain to impart new impulses to Turkey's 
structural reform. The entrepreneurial and innovative dimension of this drive has found its principal 
expression in the 2007 Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme (RCOP) (2007-2013), one of the 
RCOP's main measures being to promote R&D, innovation, the usage of technology and the increased 
transfer of knowledge. A constituent of Turkey's reform policy, RCOP rightly aims at strengthening competitiveness through 
stronger entrepreneurship, better collaborative innovations and faster diffusion of ICT. In pursuit of these 
aims, it adopts a 'growth centre approach', identifies economic 'magnets' (growth centres with a high-
growth potential) and relies on a 'bottom-up' approach (interaction between nucleus and periphery). RCOP 
has also aimed at increasing regional co-operation by ensuring the interaction of 'growth centers' with their 
hinterland and by connecting target regions to the rest of the country. Representing a coherent new 
framework for entrepreneurship and SME policies RCOP seeks to redress ingrained structural imbalances 
which past policies have failed to correct. a) 
The need for a broader support programme approach There is a strong need to broaden the support programme approach. For many years, Turkey has 
favoured industrial SME assistance providing relatively high levels of support for comparatively small 
numbers of firms. These trends have broadly continued in 2007, 2 223 industrial SMEs benefiting from 
KOSGEB's support programme and 9 826 industrial SMEs receiving KOSGEB's support credit. The 
greater part of entrepreneurial assistance for industry went to firms with more than 10 employees. This 
kind of aid concentration naturally mirrors business owners' and managers' level of educational 
attainment, a key factor determining firms' propensity to demand assistance and their capacity to absorb 
government help. While Turkey, a participant in the European BEST-programme, has increasingly applied European 
standards to SME support programmes, assistance continued, until recently, to be biased in favour of 
industry shutting out large segments of the economy (wholesaling, retailing and tourism). A different, 
broader policy approach, awarding smaller assistance to a much larger number of potential entrepreneurs 
and SMEs in all economic sectors, could be more effective in spurring innovation and firm creation. For 
this reason, KOSGEB's mandate has been extended in 2008 to cover some categories of non-industrial 
SMEs. A broader support policy approach based on best-practice programmes is known to be effective in 
making greater numbers of small and micro firms more efficient. In its latest Economic Survey of Turkey 
(2006) the OECD underscored the importance of sectoral productivity convergence:  " Raising productivity 
in the least productive sectors and firms would significantly increase average productivity levels. This 
convergence implies overcoming the deep duality persisting in the labour market as the uneven educational 
background of individuals determine their degree of participation in the labour force notably women and 
their ability to work in the formal vs. informal sectors. "  A broader policy approach, though, requires a DSTI/DOC(2008)5 123 strongly improved policy co-ordination among principal stakeholders of entrepreneurship and SME 
policies. Being a condition sine qua non for improving the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of 
support programmes these organisational and institutional desiderata have been integrated into the 2007 
RCOP. b) 
The need for entrepreneurial education and training opportunities Achieving greater productivity convergence among different firm categories (highly efficient large 
firms, efficient medium-sized firms and inefficient small and micro firms) requires a strong extension of 
educational opportunities to all segments of the society. In the long run, entrepreneurship policies tend to 
strengthen innovation trends through the systematic introduction of entrepreneurial education in schools 
and universities, the expansion of computer use in schools and universities and the creation of small 
innovation laboratories in schools. Opportunities for entrepreneurial education should also be extended to 
research centres, allowing researchers to eventually establish firms. A case in point is France's public 
IT-research institute INRIA which, through in situ entrepreneurship education, has helped researchers set 
up their own firms. Overall, Turkey's progress in the domain of entrepreneurial education appears to be 
fractional relative to adjustment requirements. Basic entrepreneurial training courses for aspiring and actual entrepreneurs are known to be highly 
effective in quickly removing inefficiencies of production via process innovation. This includes making 
entrepreneurs aware of support options and teaching them how to apply for assistance and how to put 
credit funds to best use. In this domain, Turkey has made significant progress over the past few years, as is 
evident in the rising number of training beneficiaries and instructors. c) 
The need for differentiated support services and network building Given large gaps between levels of educational attainment, the provision of support services, whether 
in the area of human capital, finance or technology, should be in consonance with the size of firms, firm 
owners educational attainment and related productivity levels. As it stands, the system of service providers 
(support units) has not yet fully embraced the heterogeneity of firms and potential entrepreneurs in both 
breadth and depth. On the other hand, low visibility of existing programmes has led, in some areas, to low 
demand for support services. The 'growth centres' approach adopted by the 9 th Development Plan and 
RCOP (2007-2013), widening the range of support services and augmenting their visibility, should 
strongly narrow the gap between demand and supply. Providing better educational and training opportunities for aspiring and actual entrepreneurs is now 
rightly seen as requiring flexible network building among different categories of service providers. One 
priority area is elementary training services for micro firms which could be vastly expanded using 
collaborative innovations (collective process innovations). These include using mobile business 
development centres which offer training services in the 'hinterland' of less developed regions as well as 
using mobile banking vans which extend micro-credits secured by new financial instruments. The 
programmed interaction between 'growth centres' and the 'periphery' is a step in the right direction. While 
progress has been made in standardising and certifying training activities, there is little evidence of 
experience-sharing among Turkey's public training support units. Such sharing needs to be encouraged 
using best-practice experience gathered by other countries. d) 
The need for a new financial infrastructure Notwithstanding a welcome rise in SMEs' bank credit over the past few years, there is a persistent 
important lack of funds (credit supplies and venture capital), financial instruments, support services and 
efficient financial networking activity. On the supply side, real interest rates, though falling, are still DSTI/DOC(2008)5 124 extremely high by international comparison. The underlying capital shortage implies high required rates of 
return on capital, damping firm creation, firm expansion and innovation. Moreover, real interest rates are 
negatively correlated with firm size, micro firms facing particularly steep barriers to finance. In this 
setting, the internationalisation of SME activities takes on particular importance as rising SME exports 
reduce the current account deficit, widening the space for interest rates to decline. In this sense, raising 
SME exports tends to ease SMEs' access to finance with the passage of time. A narrow range of banking and financial services aggravates Turkey's structural scarcity of capital. 
Private banks are not accustomed to extending credits to small and micro firms on a large scale. There is 
little expertise in assessing loan applications from firms which have no or little collateral. Moreover, a 
comprehensive loan guarantee programme modelled on successful systems applied by Germany, the World 
Bank or Mexico does not exist nor is there a government-sponsored, large network of certified credit 
advisors. A broad financial infrastructure for micro firms is inexistent. There is a strong need to expand micro 
financial services, establishing a comprehensive network of micro finance institutions. Experience in other 
countries shows that using mobile banking vans along with mobile business development centres helps 
low-income clients overcome strong barriers to finance. In the absence of such a financial infrastructure, 
banks find it rational to engage in credit rationing regardless of firms' willingness to accept more stringent 
credit terms. 81 Provisions contained in the RCOP appear to be small relative to large adjustment 
requirements in this area. On the credit demand side, small and micro firms' credit requests thus continue to be restrained by 
stringent collateral requirement, and high interest rates charged by informal money lenders. Firms 
generally view stringent collateral requirements by commercial banks as being the most important barrier 
to finance, while insufficient venture capital represents the fundamental bottleneck for start-ups. There are 
only two operational venture capital investment trusts in Turkey. In an appropriate financial setting, private banks and intermediate financial institutions are shielded 
by an efficient, national guarantee programme under which credit funds are channelled to small and micro 
firms at affordable cost. This setting would also include new financial instruments, a vastly expanded 
network of credit advisory services for these enterprises and information exchange among all financial 
stakeholders. Credit transaction costs would fall, easing small and micro firms' entry into the formal 
economy. Through state-owned banks, the government has made credit available to develop small-scale 
industrial estates (SSIE) with access to industrial space, utilities and central services. In addition, numerous 
tax incentives and offsets (tax credits) serve to stimulate the SMEs' purchases of capital equipment. But 
however useful such measures may have been for a few companies, they cannot replace the potential 
benefits from a comprehensive support structure meeting, with resilience, the financial needs of different 
business categories. While MSEs and large enterprises generally escape from credit restraints, they continue to face an 
acute shortage of venture capital and business angels, damping innovative initiatives. In 2005, most 
Turkish MSEs remained reluctant to publish financial statements audited by independent, external auditors. 
Only 3-4% of registered MSEs appear to have standard business plans, slowing the inflow of long-term 81 OECD (2007), The SME Financing Gap, Volume I, Theory and Evidence. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 125 capital. From 2007, however, the implementation of the  " Basel II "  prudential rules is expected to change 
the way banks allocate capital to risk. 82 e) 
The need for stronger vertical linkages Upgrading the tangible and intangible human capital of SMEs paves the way for building vertical 
links with large companies. In many countries, the growing specialisation of industries has led to more 
diversified production modes, with many semi-finished goods assembled to produce final products. Several 
low per capita income countries, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), have drawn up programmes for suppliers' development allowing SMEs to become members of 
vertical supply chains. Such links have been created in industry as well as in the services sector (e.g. 
hospitals and restaurants in Mexico). Involving continuous interactions between large firms and SMEs, vertical links strengthen process 
innovations of both suppliers and final producers. 83 Despite the creation of Organised Industrial Zones and 
small-scale industrial estates, Turkey still has ample room for exploiting the potential of such chain-based 
innovations. Activating this potential should become possible with the RCOP's 'growth centre' approach. 
The 2005 EU-funded project 'Development of a Clustering Policy in Turkey' should contribute to the 
process of enhanced network building. Concluding remarks A successful entrepreneurship and SME policy evolves through time with the maturing of both 
innovative processes and supporting service units. Three policy phases can be usefully distinguished, the 
first one spurring R&D and innovation so as to create vast segments of ISMEs and HSMEs. During the 
second phase, the innovations are spread through improved scientific-technological networks, specialised 
institutions and better access to finance (including venture capital). In the third and final phase, the 
innovative momentum gathers pace stimulated by learning effects and the transition to the knowledge 
economy. As regards large, industrial firms and MSEs, Turkey has, over the past few years, made significant 
progress in the first two policy phases of this process. This is evident in stronger R&D efforts, better 
education and training opportunities, stronger innovative activity and expanded support services and 
networking facilities. As a result, most large firms and many MSEs are internationally competitive. At the 
same time, though, this progress has been unequal, as vast numbers of small and micro firms outside 
industry (oversupply of subsistence entrepreneurship) continue to lack access to technology, education, 
training and finance. Stimulating the growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity of these  " excluded "  firms requires broadened 
support programmes (covering non-industrial sectors), tailor-made network building (bundling of micro 
firms for vertical and horizontal purposes) as well as better policy co-ordination among major stakeholders 
of entrepreneurship and SME policy. It also requires determined efforts to use international best practices 
to bring real interest rates down from abnormally high levels. Experience has shown that falling interest 
rates combined with rising supplies of collateral-free funds will ease firms' entry into the formal economy. 
Moreover, creating collaborative innovations will help small and micro firms enter international markets. 
Rising SME exports will then contribute to reducing the large current account deficit, opening doors for 
interest rates to fall. This sequence points to the indirect link connecting the internationalisation of SME 
activities and the easing of barriers to finance. Focusing coherent policy programmes on the more 82 OECD (2006), Economic Survey of Turkey, p. 129. 83 OECD (2007), SMEs in Mexico, p. 60, p. 80. DSTI/DOC(2008)5 126 vulnerable segments of the business sector thus constitutes a pre-condition for achieving stronger economic 
convergence with the EU. The new framework for entrepreneurship and SME policies (2007-2013) established by the 
Pre-Accession Process largely meets these concerns. Fully implemented the RCOP is bound to show that 
innovative and entrepreneurial activities are co-dependent. Box 4.3. Policy recommendations Broaden Support Programme Approach Extend entrepreneurship and SME policy support to include non-industrial firms

close correspondence with the 2006 EU legal framework governing pre-accession assistance for 
'candidate' countries. The EU Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) covering the period 
2007-2013 helps aspiring countries qualify for the receipt of EU structural funds guiding them on their 
path to eventual EU membership. IPA assists these countries in their efforts to align themselves on EU 
standards and policy practices. It distinguishes between five intervention areas (components). These 
comprise Transition Assistance and Institutional Building, Cross-Border Cooperation, Regional 
Development, Human Resources Development and Rural development. The intervention area 'Regional 
Development' consists of three sub-components one of which 'The Operational Programme for Regional 
Competitiveness' (RCOP, 2007-2009) provides a new framework for Turkey's entrepreneurship and SME 
policies (Figure 4.A.1). Figure 4.A.1. The EU-Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), Intervention Areas and Operational

intervention areas. The programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the IPA assistance 
processes constitute indispensable tools to qualify Turkey for the receipt of EU structural funds. Concrete 
'outputs' of the IPA process are so-called Operational Programmes, one of which is the Operational 
Programme for Regional Competitiveness (RCOP). The thrust of Turkeys' new entrepreneurship and SME 
policies are enshrined in this programme. RCOP has been prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
in collaboration with central and regional policy stakeholders, the EU Commission and the State Planning 
Organisation (SPO). Its operating structure is provided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Figure

Internal Audit Note: Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme (November 2007) RCOP, a principal policy instrument to achieve faster convergence with the EU, has two main 
priorities: the improvement of the business environment ('macro scale intervention axis') and the 
bolstering of enterprise capacity and entrepreneurial activity ('micro scale intervention axis'). Widening 
KOSGEB's mandate, RCOP focuses on manufacturing, tourism, information society, R&D and innovation 
in regions with a per capita income of less than 75% of the Turkish average ('thematic and geographical 
concentration'). According to this criterion, there are 12 underdeveloped regions (NUTSII regions or 
nomenclature of territorial units) where 26% of all firms are located, mostly in the Eastern part of the 
country. Inside these regions, 15 growth centres with a high growth potential have been identified 
harbouring about 14% of all firms. Under the macro-scale intervention axis, RCOP strives to establish an 
effective R&D, innovation, ICT and tourism infrastructure. To this end, RCOP places strong emphasis upon inter-regional co-operation as well as upon 
interaction between 'growth centres' and their hinterland (interaction between nucleus and periphery) and 
between target regions and the rest of the country (collaborative innovation or collective process 
innovation). Under the micro-scale intervention axis, RCOP seeks to develop export-oriented innovative 
HSMEs relying on a wider range of better business consultancy services. The integration of SMEs into 
international markets is rightly seen as a key route to reducing Turkey's large current account deficit. A 
smaller excess of imports over exports creates room for lower domestic interest rates, thereby easing firms' 
access to finance.
