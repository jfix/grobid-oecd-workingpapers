			<p>1.<lb/> The Joint Working Party on Trade and Environment (JWPTE) agreed to develop a checklist on<lb/> environmental issues for negotiators of regional trade agreements (RTAs) as part of its Programme of<lb/> Work for 2007-8. The aim of the checklist is to provide guidance to countries wishing to include<lb/> environmental provisions in RTAs.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The attached draft checklist includes issues that some countries have chosen to include in all or<lb/> some of the RTAs they have signed, and which other countries may find useful when considering their<lb/> own approaches to environmental issues in RTAs. It draws on countries&apos; experience of negotiating and<lb/> implementing environmental provisions of RTAs, as described in the book &quot; Environment and Regional<lb/> Trade Agreements &quot; (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2007</ref>), as well as more recent experiences. The boxes provide illustrative<lb/> examples drawn from some of the recent RTAs. They present partial excerpts from some agreements, and<lb/> are not intended to be comprehensive. Further information may be obtained via the links to the agreements<lb/> that are embedded in the text.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The checklist is not prescriptive. It is intended to provide a reference to assist discussion of<lb/> environmental issues, when the inclusion of environmental provisions is considered appropriate, before,<lb/> during and after negotiation of trade agreements. Since the adoption of the North America Free Trade<lb/> Agreement (NAFTA) in the early 1990s, there have been major changes in the ways in which<lb/> environmental provisions have been integrated in regional trade agreements, both qualitatively and<lb/> quantitatively. The parties to NAFTA (Canada, Mexico and the US) have modified their approaches in<lb/> response to evolving needs, and other countries have developed their own approaches according to their<lb/> specific needs and interests. As the number and variety of RTAs continues to increase, the checklist should<lb/> be viewed as a &quot; living document &quot; that could be modified and updated as countries gain new experience.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The checklist consists of the following four sections: 1) alternative approaches for incorporating<lb/> environmental provisions in RTAs; 2) environmental impact assessment of RTAs; 3) the contents of<lb/> environmental provisions; 4) institutional issues; and 5) overarching issues.<lb/></p>

			<head>Alternative approaches for incorporating environmental provisions in RTAs<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> Provisions dealing with environmental issues can be incorporated in different ways into trade<lb/> agreements. Many countries include references to, or key statements on, environment in the preamble of<lb/> agreements. Some agreements have a few provisions and others a full chapter on environment; some have<lb/> a side agreement dealing with environmental issues; some have both.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mandate to include environmental issues in trade agreements<lb/></head>

			<p>• What is the Parties&apos; mandate to include environmental considerations in trade agreements?<lb/> • What are the key elements of that mandate?<lb/></p>

			<p>• Which of these elements are legally binding?<lb/></p>

			<p>• Which Ministries have responsibility for implementing the mandate?<lb/></p>

			<head>Basic choices regarding environmental issues in RTAs<lb/></head>

			<p>There are various ways in which environmental provisions can be included in RTAs: directly in<lb/> the agreement or in a side agreement or both. The provisions may or may not be legally binding.<lb/> • Will environmental issues be dealt with in the body of the RTA, in a separate agreement, or in<lb/> both?<lb/> • Will trade and environment issues be negotiated together or separately?<lb/> • What type of commitments related to environment will the agreement contain: binding, non-<lb/>binding, a mixture of both?<lb/> • Will the environmental provisions be enforceable or subject to dispute resolution?<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Some basic choices concerning treatment of the environment in RTAs<lb/> Environment as part of the RTA<lb/></head>

			<p>•</p>

			<table>The Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) Treaty includes a Chapter on &quot; Co-operation<lb/> in Environment and Natural Resources &quot; (Chapter VI); http://www.ecowas.int/.<lb/> • The Partnership Agreement between the ACP Group of States and the EC (Cotonou Agreement) deals with<lb/> &quot; Environment and Natural Resources &quot; in Chapter 32;<lb/> http://ec.europa.eu/development/ICenter/Pdf/agr01_en.pdf.<lb/> Environmental side agreements<lb/> • The Environment Co-operation Agreement among the Parties to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic<lb/> Partnership Agreement (Brunei Darussalam, the Republic of Chile, New Zealand, and the Republic of<lb/> Singapore) is a separate environmental side agreement, negotiated in parallel with the trade agreement;<lb/> http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/trade-agreement/transpacific/environment-agreement.pdf<lb/> • MERCOSUR members adopted a Framework Agreement on Environment in 2001, ten years after the adoption<lb/> of the main trade agreement; http://www.medioambiente.gov.ar/mercosur.<lb/></table>

			<head>Environment in the RTA and in a separate agreement<lb/></head>

			<p>• The North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as all RTAs subsequently negotiated by the US,<lb/> include detailed environmental provisions, and have, in addition, a side agreement or other separate<lb/> instruments dealing with environmental issues, such as the North American Agreement on Environmental Co-<lb/>operation (NAAEC); http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/nafta-alena/agree-en.asp. (NAFTA);<lb/> http://www.cec.org/pubs_info_resources/law_treat_agree/naaec/index.cfm?varlan=english (NAEEC).<lb/> • The US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (US-CAFTA-DR) includes a chapter on<lb/> the Environment (Chapter 17), and has an Environmental Co-operation Agreement (US-CAFTA-DR ECA<lb/> http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html (US-<lb/>CAFTA-DR); http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/or/42423.htm (US-CAFTA-DR ECA).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. Legally binding vs non-binding commitments on the environment<lb/></head>

			<p>In most current RTAs, provisions on the environment are formulated in a non-binding manner (hortatory language,<lb/> &quot; strive for &quot; commitments, etc.)<lb/></p>

			<table>• The Arrangement on Environment signed in conjunction with the New Zealand-Thailand Closer Economic<lb/> Partnership Agreement indicates (in Section 4) that the Arrangement &quot; represents a political commitments<lb/> but does not legally bind either country. &quot;<lb/> http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/environment.html.<lb/> Some RTAs, including all recent RTAs by the United States, contain legally binding environmental provisions.<lb/> • NAAEC provides for an obligation by the Parties to effectively enforce their environmental laws, and includes<lb/> a mechanism to ensure enforcement of this commitment (dispute settlement and public submissions<lb/> mechanisms) http:// www.cec.org/pubs_info_resources/law_treat_agree/naaec/index.cfm?varlan=english<lb/> (NAAEC).<lb/></table>

			<head>Environmental Impact Assessments of RTAs<lb/></head>

			<p>6.<lb/> Environmental assessments of RTAs are used to identify and manage the environmental impacts<lb/> that may result from the agreement. Ex ante assessments often contribute to the preparation of the<lb/> agreement. Ex post assessments analyse the impacts of the agreement and may result in proposals to amend<lb/> the agreement. Some countries include participatory and consultative mechanisms into the assessment of<lb/> RTAs in order to strengthen the information base and to build support for the agreements.<lb/> • Is there a mandate to conduct an environmental assessment?<lb/> • Will the assessment be ex ante, ex post, or both?<lb/> • Will impacts be assessed only in the country doing the assessment or in all partner countries?<lb/> • To what extent will the transboundary effects of the agreement be considered?<lb/></p>

			<p>• What methodology will be used for the assessment?<lb/> • Will responsibility for conducting the assessment be assigned to a government department or an<lb/> independent contractor?<lb/> • Who will be involved in the assessment (e.g., other agencies, experts, stakeholders, etc.), how<lb/> and at which stages?<lb/> • How will the assessment be financed, and what is the timeframe?<lb/> • Will the findings on likely environmental effects be fed into the negotiation mandate or the actual<lb/> negotiation of the agreement?<lb/></p>

			<table>Box 4. Mandates to carry out environmental assessments<lb/> • The EU carries out Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs) for the negotiation of major multilateral, regional<lb/> and bilateral trade agreements. This practice has not yet evolved into a strict legal obligation but is supported<lb/> by the Communication on Impact Assessment issued by the EU Commission in 2002, which has the legal<lb/> status of a policy guideline. It requires the Commission to execute environmental, economic and social impact<lb/> studies for different types of major regulatory initiatives; http://www.trade-<lb/>nfo.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2005/february/tradoc_121479.pdf.<lb/> • Canada derives its mandate to conduct Environmental Assessments (EAs) of trade agreements from the 1999<lb/> &quot; Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals &quot; and the 2001<lb/> &quot; Framework for Conducting Environmental Assessment of Trade Negotiations &quot; ; http://www.dfait-<lb/>maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/Environment-en.asp#annex1 (1999 Cabinet Directive); http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-<lb/>nac/Environment-en.asp#N_1_ (2001 Framework).<lb/> • In New Zealand, a Parliamentary Standing Order requires that a National Interest Analysis be conducted for all<lb/> treaties to which New Zealand may become a Party. The NIA includes an environmental component and is<lb/> supported by the 2001 &quot; Framework for Integrating Environmental Standards and Trade Agreements &quot; .<lb/> However, a NIA is required after the agreement is signed, so there is no opportunity to influence the<lb/> negotiating mandate or the negotiations. http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/636A8940-48FA-<lb/>4A93-B8E6-3DD0844BB68E/0/SO2003bm.pdf (Parliamentary Standing Order 383);<lb/> http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/WTO/0-environment-framework.php<lb/> (2001 Framework).<lb/> • In the United States, the framework for conducting Environmental Reviews (ERs) of trade agreements is<lb/> provided by Executive Order 13141 &quot; Environmental Review of Trade Agreements &quot; (1999) and the Guidelines<lb/> for Implementation of Executive Order 13141 (2000) http://www.nepa.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13141.html (1999<lb/> Executive Order 13141);<lb/> http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Sectors/Environment/Guidelines_for_Environmental_Reviews/asset_upload<lb/> _file556_5734.pdf (2000 Guidelines).<lb/> Box 5. Geographical scope of assessments<lb/> • Environmental assessments of trade agreements by Canada and the United States focus on environmental<lb/> impacts in their respective countries. Transboundary effects are only considered to the extent that they have<lb/> direct impacts on the environment in the assessing country.<lb/> • The EU&apos;s Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs) explore not only environmental but also economic and<lb/> social impacts. They also focus on impacts in partner countries. Some assessments involve almost no analysis<lb/> of impacts in the EU but focus almost exclusively on environmental impacts in partner countries, such as the<lb/> ongoing EU-African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) SIA.<lb/> http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/issues/global/sia/studies_geo.htm#acp<lb/> Box 6. In-house vs. external assessments<lb/> • In Canada and the United States, environmental assessments are conducted by the government, and involve<lb/> government experts and negotiators. The US also seeks and incorporates, as appropriate, public comment on<lb/> its environmental reviews.<lb/> • The EU Commission awards contracts to carry out SIAs to independent external consultants following a public<lb/> tender procedure. A consultation committee within the Commission is set up to guide the consultants. Civil<lb/> society coordination with Member State experts and Members of the European Parliament is part of the SIA<lb/> process.<lb/> Box 7. Methodologies for environmental reviews of trade agreements<lb/> • Details on methodologies applied in recent assessments can be found on the websites referred to in Box 6.<lb/> • Guidance on approaches developed by the OECD can be found in<lb/> OECD methodologies for environmental and trade reviews<lb/> http://www.oecd.org/document/45/0,3343,en_2649_34183_36629293_1_1_1_1,00.html<lb/> Checklist of Issues for Ex Ante Environmental Assessments of Trade Liberalisation<lb/> [COM/TD/ENV(2001)42/FINAL]. http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2001doc.nsf/LinkTo/COM-TD-ENV(2001)42-<lb/>FINAL.<lb/> Assessing the Environmental Effects of Services Trade Liberalisation: a Methodology<lb/> [COM/TD/ENV(2000)123/FINAL]. http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2000doc.nsf/LinkTo/com-td-env(2000)123-final.<lb/> • Guidance on &quot; Rapid Trade and Environment Assessments &quot; by the International Institute for Sustainable<lb/> Development can be found at http://www.iisd.org/trade/policy/rapid_trade.asp.<lb/> • The EU has produced a specific methodology for its Trade SIAs. This is set out in the &apos;Handbook for Trade SIAs&apos;.<lb/> http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/march/tradoc_127974.pdf<lb/></table>

			<p>7.<lb/> Some countries jointly conduct feasibility studies to analyse their trade relations and to assess<lb/> whether or not to enter into a RTA. Such feasibility studies may be conducted prior to, or in conjunction<lb/> with, an ex ante environmental assessment.<lb/> • Will the feasibility study include environmental considerations, and, if so, how?<lb/> • Who will be involved in carrying out the feasibility study?<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 8. Environmental considerations in the feasibility study of trade agreements<lb/></figure>

			<p>• In the New Zealand-China Trade and Economic Cooperation Framework, which provides for a Joint Feasibility<lb/> Study into a bilateral FTA negotiation, New Zealand and China committed to exploring opportunities to share<lb/> information and to cooperate on measures to promote environmental protection, sustainable development and<lb/> resource management, and the protection of biodiversity. It reaffirms objectives that the two countries have been<lb/> working on through existing mechanisms in areas such as agriculture, including wool, forestry, science and<lb/> technology, tourism, education, environmental protection and investment. http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-<lb/>Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/0--Trade-agreements/China/0-chapterone.php#trade<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional issues<lb/> Inter-ministerial co-ordination<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> The allocation of responsibilities and functions to environmental ministries or departments can<lb/> affect the mandate under which they conduct negotiations. In some countries, environmental and<lb/> sustainable development responsibilities are split among different agencies and the agency leading<lb/> negotiations may not have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the others. The scope of an environment<lb/> agreement can reflect these limitations.<lb/> • Which ministries will be involved in the negotiation of environmental issues, and at which level?<lb/> • How will Parties ensure co-ordination between ministries on environmental issues following<lb/> adoption of the agreement?<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional arrangements for implementation<lb/></head>

			<p>15.<lb/> The implementation of environmental provisions in trade agreements requires some institutional<lb/> arrangements. Under some agreements, Parties have set up joint institutions, whose mandate is provided<lb/> for in the agreement. Parties often also commit to meet regularly to discuss implementation, and designate<lb/> new or existing national institutions to oversee implementation at the domestic level.<lb/> • Which institutions are needed to oversee the environmental aspects of the RTA, both<lb/> domestically and among the Parties?<lb/> • Will an existing or a new institution be charged with overseeing implementation of the<lb/> environmental aspects of the agreement?<lb/> • What is the mandate of the institution charged with overseeing implementation of the agreement?<lb/> • What will be the reporting mechanisms of these institutions (e.g. reporting to trade and<lb/> environment ministries or a body charged with overall implementation of the agreement)?<lb/></p>

			<head>Relationship with other international commitments<lb/></head>

			<figure>16.<lb/> Some RTAs strive for consistency with the trade and environment provisions in other<lb/> international agreements, i.e. multilateral environmental agreements.<lb/> • How will the relationship between the RTA and other international commitments (in particular,<lb/> multilateral and regional environmental agreements and trade obligations) be reflected in the<lb/> RTA?<lb/> • How will potential conflicts on environment and trade issues between international commitments<lb/> and the RTA be handled?<lb/> Box 16. Institutions to oversee the environmental elements of the RTA<lb/> Many RTAs, and in some cases their environmental side agreements, establish specific institutions, composed of<lb/> representatives of the Parties, to oversee the implementation of the environmental commitments in the agreement.<lb/> • The NAAEC provides for a Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to be set up (Article 8).<lb/> http://www.cec.org/pubs_info_resources/law_treat_agree/naaec/index.cfm?varlan=english<lb/> • The Environment Committee set up under the Arrangement on Environment between New Zealand and<lb/> Thailand is comprised of senior officials of the government agencies responsible for environmental matters.<lb/> Article 3 (paragraph 4 and paragraph 7). http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-<lb/>archive/0--Trade-agreements/Thailand/0-environment.php<lb/></figure>

			<p>Under some agreements, an existing institution is assigned responsibilities to deal with matters arising from the<lb/> agreement&apos;s provisions.<lb/> • Under the US-CAFTA-DR (Article 17.7), the existing Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration<lb/> (SIECA), has been assigned to deal with public submissions by citizens from all Parties, except US citizens,<lb/> who<lb/> may<lb/> bring<lb/> submissions<lb/> before<lb/> the<lb/> CEC<lb/> established<lb/> under<lb/> the<lb/> NAAEC.<lb/> http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 17. The relationship between provisions in the RTA and other international commitments<lb/></head>

			<p>· NAFTA, in its Article 104 (Relation to Environmental and Conservation Agreements), provides: &quot; In the event of any<lb/> inconsistency between this Agreement and the specific trade obligations set out in: a) the Convention on<lb/> International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref>,b) the Montreal Protocol on Substances<lb/> that Deplete the Ozone Layer <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref>,c) the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of<lb/> Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref>, or d) the agreements set out in Annex 104.1, such obligations shall<lb/> prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, provided that where a Party has a choice among equally effective and<lb/> reasonably available means of complying with such obligations, the Party chooses the alternative that is the least<lb/> inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement &quot; (paragraph 1) and that &quot; The Parties may agree in writing<lb/> to modify Annex 104.1 to include any amendment to an agreement referred to in paragraph 1, and any other<lb/> environmental or conservation agreement &quot; (paragraph 2); http://www.nafta-sec-<lb/>alena.org/DefaultSite/index_e.aspx?DetailID=79.<lb/> · The US-CAFTA-DR includes an article on the Relationship to Environmental Agreements (Article 17.12): &quot; The<lb/> Parties recognize that multilateral environmental agreements to which they are all party play an important role in<lb/> protecting the environment globally and domestically and that their respective implementation of these agreements<lb/> is critical to achieving the environmental objectives of these agreements. The Parties further recognize that this<lb/> Chapter and the ECA can contribute to realizing the goals of those agreements. Accordingly, the Parties shall<lb/> continue to seek means to enhance the mutual supportiveness of multilateral environmental agreements to which<lb/> they are all party and trade agreements to which they are all party &quot; (paragraph 1). &quot; The Parties may consult, as<lb/> appropriate, with respect to ongoing negotiations in the WTO regarding multilateral environmental agreements &quot;<lb/> (paragraph 2); http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-<lb/>DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html<lb/> · The Canada-Chile Agreement provides in its Article A-03 that &quot; <ref type="biblio">[i]</ref>n the event of any inconsistency between this<lb/> Agreement and such other agreements, this Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, except as<lb/> otherwise provided in this Agreement &quot; (paragraph 2). It further provides that &quot; <ref type="biblio">[i]</ref>n the event of any inconsistency<lb/> between this Agreement and the specific trade obligations set out in:</p>

			<figure>(a) the Convention on International Trade in<lb/> Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora […]; (b) the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the<lb/> Ozone Layer; or (c) the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and<lb/> Their Disposal <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref>, such obligations shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, provided that where a Party has<lb/> a choice among equally effective and reasonably available means of complying with such obligations, the Party<lb/> chooses the alternative that is the least inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement. &quot; http://www.dfait-<lb/>maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/cda-chile/menu-en.asp<lb/></p>

			<head>Overarching issues<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> This section refers to overarching issues that need to be considered through all the phases related<lb/> to the negotiation and implementation of the RTA.<lb/></p>

			<head>Budget<lb/></head>

			<figure>• Will the RTA address financing issues and, if so, how?<lb/> • Which aspects of the implementation of the RTAs require on-going funding?<lb/> • Which ministry or department will provide funding for environmental issues under the RTA?<lb/> • How will a recurring budget for environmental co-operation be secured?<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Are there any requirements for public participation or consultation with experts when developing<lb/> or implementing the RTA, or for dispute settlement?<lb/> • How will public or expert input be fed into the negotiation or implementation of the RTA?<lb/> • Are specific mechanisms in place for public participation or consultation with experts on<lb/> environmental issues during the negotiation or implementation of the RTA or for dispute<lb/> settlement?<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 19. Public participation during the negotiation of environmental issues in RTAs<lb/> •<lb/> Canada uses a range of public consultation mechanisms, including internet consultations and workshops in<lb/> relation with trade agreements under negotiation, including on environmental impact assessments;<lb/> http://international.gc.ca/tna-nac/consult-en.asp#Cur.<lb/></figure>

			<p>•<lb/> The USTR and the EPA co-host the Trade and Environment Policy Advisory Committee (TEPAC) to seek<lb/> inputs from the high level group of representatives from the industry, environmental and consumer interest<lb/> groups, agriculture, services, and non-Federal governments. The committee is required by its charter to be<lb/> &quot; broadly representative of key sectors and groups of the economy, with an interest in trade and environment<lb/> policy issues. &quot; TEPAC meetings are announced through Federal Register notices and its reports are<lb/> published on the USTR website; http://www.ustr.gov.<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> New Zealand involves the public through internet consultations. e.g. on feasibility studies of a trade<lb/> agreement before starting the negotiations (for example, public consultation on the joint feasibility study on<lb/> an FTA with China; http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/0--Trade-<lb/>agreements/China/0-publicconsultationdoc.php.) and through information bulletins during the course of the<lb/> negotiations; (http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/Trade-Agreements/China/index.php).<lb/> •<lb/> The EU has a structured dialogue with civil society organisations (business associations, NGOs, trade<lb/> unions, agricultural associations, etc), where all trade matters are discussed, including ongoing negotiations<lb/> of RTAs. (Civil Society Dialogue website of the European Commission&apos;s Directorate-General for External<lb/> Trade: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/civilsoc/index.cfm ). In addition, consultations with civil society and the<lb/> public at large are held during the various stages of the drafting of Trade SIAs, so that civil society can<lb/> directly input into the preparation of these assessments. A workshop for civil society organisations of the<lb/> partner country/ies concerned is also organised. During the SIA process, a specific website is opened<lb/> for civil society as well as the public to send their written contributions on the SIAs.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 20. Mechanisms for public participation in RTAs<lb/> Some RTAs contain mechanisms for public participation in the negotiation and implementation of the agreement.<lb/> •<lb/> The Agreement on Environmental Co-operation between Canada and Costa Rica provides in its Article 11<lb/> (Public Engagement) that &quot; [t]he Parties will develop mechanisms to inform the public of activities undertaken<lb/> pursuant to this Agreement, and will make efforts to create opportunities to engage the public, as<lb/> appropriate, in such activities &quot; ; http://www.ec.gc.ca/international/costarica/env_coop_e.pdf.<lb/></figure>

			<p>•<lb/> Under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (<ref type="biblio">Article 19.3, paragraph 4</ref>): &quot; Each Party shall promote public<lb/> awareness of its environmental laws by ensuring that information is available to the public regarding its<lb/> environmental laws and enforcement and compliance procedures, including procedures for interested<lb/> persons to request the Party&apos;s competent authorities to investigate alleged violations of its environmental<lb/> laws. A Party may use a variety of means available for this purpose, such as publishing information and<lb/> notices in official bulletins and the mass media, publishing and distributing information manuals, undertaking<lb/> compliance assistance programs, conducting meetings, and making information available through the<lb/> Internet &quot; ; http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/final-text/index.html<lb/> Some RTAs put in place public participation mechanisms in the context of dispute settlement.<lb/> •<lb/> Article 20.11 of the US-CAFTA-DR (Third Party Participation) provides that &quot; <ref type="biblio">[a]</ref> Party that is not a disputing<lb/> Party, on delivery of a written notice to the disputing Parties, shall be entitled to attend all hearings, to make<lb/> written and oral submissions to the panel, and to receive written submissions of the disputing Parties in<lb/> accordance with the Model Rules of Procedure. Those submissions shall be reflected in the final report of<lb/> the<lb/> panel &quot; ;<lb/> http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Regional/CAFTA/CAFTA-DR_Final_Texts/Section_Index.html<lb/> •<lb/> The Australia-US RTA instructs the Parties to develop model rules of procedure that ensure &quot; that the panel<lb/> shall consider requests from nongovernmental persons or entities in the Parties&apos; territories to provide written<lb/> views regarding the dispute that may assist the panel in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the<lb/> Parties and provide the Parties an opportunity to respond to such written views &quot; (Article 21.8, paragraph<lb/> 1.d); http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/final-text/index.html.<lb/></p>

			<head>Performance review of environmental provisions in RTAs<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> Reviewing the performance of environmental provisions in RTAs provides information on the<lb/> extent to which its objectives have been achieved, and provides a basis for considering possible<lb/> amendments to the RTA.<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Will the review cover all or selected parts of the environmental provisions of the RTA?<lb/> • What period should elapse before the first review?<lb/> • How frequently should the reviews be carried out?<lb/> • Who should carry out the review; who should pay for it and to whom should the findings be<lb/> reported?<lb/></figure>

			<p>• If Parties decide to carry out an ex-post environment assessment of RTAs, will the results of such<lb/> assessment as well as those of the assessment and review of cooperation efforts be fed into the<lb/> performance review of the environmental provisions in RTAs, and if so, how?<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 21. Performance Review<lb/></head>

			<p>•<lb/> The Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPSEPA) includes Article 4.5; &apos;After<lb/> three years, or as otherwise agreed, the Parties shall review the operation of this (Environment)<lb/> Agreement and report to the TPSEP Commission&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<head>•<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2004, an independent Ten-year Review and Assessment Committee (TRAC) was formed to<lb/> undertake an examination of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. TRAC<lb/> produced a report that reviewed the implementation of the NAAEC and provide an assessment of the<lb/> impacts of the various programs of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The report<lb/> included an examination of the institutional aspects of the CEC, the implementation of the specific<lb/> mechanisms of the NAAEC, and how the CEC has addressed the environmental impacts of NAFTA.<lb/> The report also provided recommendations to the Council on charting a path for the CEC over the next<lb/> decade. The review of the NAAEC is the only ex-post assessment so far.</p>
