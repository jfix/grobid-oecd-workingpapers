extreme events. These losses are projected to continue to increase in future, driven by climate change and 
the accumulation of people and assets in high-risk areas. Effective climate change policies are needed to 
reduce the accumulation of risk, combined with instruments and tools to help retain, share or transfer 
financial losses if an extreme event occurs. These tools and instruments, collectively known as financial 
protection, can help people cope with the impacts of climate-related disasters, reduce costs of recovery and 
reconstruction, and encourage risk reduction. Linking financial protection and climate adaptation in 
development planning and policy has the potential to increase the resilience of affected communities. This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to examine how countries are using financial 
protection as part of their approaches to managing climate risks. The paper identifies emerging priorities 
for development co-operation providers in supporting financial protection against climate risks.

National Climate Change System ENV/WKP(2017)7 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY There is a need to implement integrated approaches to managing climate risks, bringing together 
climate change adaptation with financial protection. Developing countries are disproportionately affected 
by the rising trend of losses from climate-related extreme events. These losses are projected to continue to 
increase in future, driven by climate change and the accumulation of people and assets in high-risk areas. 
Effective climate change policies are needed to reduce the accumulation of risk, combined with 
instruments and tools to help retain, share or transfer financial losses if an extreme event occurs. These 
tools and instruments, collectively known as financial protection, can help people cope with the impacts of 
climate-related disasters, reduce costs of recovery and reconstruction, and encourage risk reduction. 
Linking financial protection and climate adaptation in development planning and policy has the potential to 
increase the resilience of affected communities. Development support providers are increasingly supporting countries' efforts to improve the 
management of climate-related risks with increased funding and new initiatives. These efforts are being 
given further impetus by the Paris Agreement on climate change, Sustainable Development Goals and the 
G7 InsuResilience initiative. This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to examine how countries are using financial 
protection as part of their approaches to managing climate risks. The following recommendations for 
development co-operation providers have emerged from this analysis:  Expertise from development co-operation providers in gathering, analysing and interpreting data, 
and providing platforms to share knowledge and improve the evidence base can help countries to 
define their financial protection strategies. In Senegal, for example, the creation of a national 
registry of social protection beneficiaries also provides an opportunity to improve the targeting of 
financial protection payments.  Technical support for undertaking assessments of the financial impacts of climate-related 
disasters can help create an evidence base that generates political will to improve the 
management of climate-related risks. In Colombia, an analysis of the 2010-2011 La Niña floods 
provided momentum for creating a new system for Disaster Risk Management. This system 
included the creation of a domestic Adaptation Fund, strengthened insurance coverage for new 
road concessions and the creation of a national financial protection strategy.  Providers can support key agencies, such as the finance ministry, in designing and implementing 
financial protection tools for climate risks. This includes capacity building, knowledge transfer 
and advisory services, all of which can act as catalysts for change. In Senegal, for example, 
capacity development for the planned Civil Protection Agency could facilitate the streamlining of 
resources, the assessment of gaps, and ultimately lead to a better co-ordinated disaster risk 
reduction policy.  Providers should strengthen their in-country co-ordination to avoid duplication of efforts and 
capitalise on their respective areas of expertise. In Colombia, a long-standing partnership 
between the finance ministry, the Swiss Development Co-operation agency and the World Bank, 
with support from other partners, has resulted in a sophisticated financial protection strategy. In 
Senegal, separate programmes led by OXFAM/World Food Programme and USAID are focusing 
on small farmers' resilience to drought and have shared meteorological data to contribute to the 
scaling-up of insurance for poor farmers. ENV/WKP(2017)7 8 1. 
Introduction Financial losses from extreme events are continuing to increase, driven in part by the rising 
concentration of people and assets in areas exposed to climate-related disasters. Climate change is already 
starting to change the frequency and severity of some types of extreme events, such as coastal and inland 
flooding and drought. Developing countries are affected disproportionately by this trend (OECD, 2009). 
Despite having contributed relatively little to the problem of climate change, developing countries are 
projected to bear approximately four-fifths of the costs caused by a 2°C increase in average global 
temperature (World Bank, 2010). Climate change will increase the scale of losses from extreme climate 
events, but also increase uncertainty about the future. The combination of climate change and rapid socio-
economic development means that historical information has become less reliable as a guide to 
understanding the risks of future extreme events. Climate change and variability contribute to poverty, reducing incomes and increasing the risks faced 
by the poor. The impacts of climate change will be uneven, with the IPCC finding:  " the majority of severe 
impacts are projected for urban areas and some rural regions in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia "  
(Olsson et al, 2014). Informal settlements in urban areas are often located in risky areas, while the 
buildings in these settlements are highly vulnerable to extreme events. Meanwhile, agricultural incomes are 
extremely sensitive to weather patterns; both are affected by changes such as declining precipitation and 
extreme events such as droughts. Ambitious mitigation to reduce the severity of climate change is essential. This should be supported 
by enhanced and co-ordinated action across different policy agendas to address climate-related risks, and 
reduce their impacts on the most vulnerable groups (G20/OECD, 2012; GIZ, 2015):  Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation to tackle the impacts of current climate 
extremes and support the transition to a future climate;  Financial protection (the use of financial tools to retain, transfer and share risk) to address the 
financial consequences of risks that materialise. This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to explore how financial protection tools can be 
used as part of an integrated strategy to manage climate-related risks, alongside adaptation and disaster risk 
management. It summarises the emerging lessons from these countries and draws out initial conclusions on 
how development co-operation can best support this process. These case studies are based on interviews 
with government officials and key stakeholders, expert workshops held in each country and desk research. 
The case studies were guided by the following research questions:  What are the rationales for and expected outcomes of using climate-related financial protection 
tools, based on experience in the selected countries and/or regions?  How are mechanisms for financial protection best placed in a broader set or continuum of 
adaptation and disaster risk management policies within a developing country?  Based on experience to date, what does the evidence suggest are the key results, factors driving 
success and remaining challenges for effective integration of financial protection mechanisms?  How can financial protection mechanisms influence the incentives of public and private sector 
actors to implement risk reduction measures? ENV/WKP(2017)7 9  What evidence has emerged on the role of donors in developing, financing and implementing 
these measures? Box 1. Glossary of Key Terms Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, 
adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human 
intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects Disaster risk management is the systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and 
operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the 
adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster. Financial protection is the use of strategies and tools to manage the financial impact of extreme events, 
ensuring adequate capacity to manage and reduce the costs of climate risk, thereby reducing the financial burden and 
economic costs of climate risks and enabling rapid recovery in economic activity Resilience is the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or 
trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure, 
while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Risk is the combination of the probability of an event and its negative consequences if it occurs. Vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of 
concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility (or exposure) to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. Sources: G20/OECD (2012); IPCC (2014); UNISDR (2009); OECD (2014a). Even with enhanced adaptation and mitigation efforts, it will not be cost-effective, or even technically 
feasible, to eliminate climate risk (OECD, 2014b). Financial protection tools – such as insurance or social 
protection instruments – have the potential to reduce the vulnerability of people, assets and economies to 
negative shocks. Improving the quality and availability of financial protection tools has benefits both 
before and after an extreme climate event. Before an adverse event, it can increase productivity, as it 
provides more security to pursue more profitable, but riskier, opportunities such as purchasing agricultural 
inputs on credit. After an event, it can help to protect livelihoods by reducing the need to engage in erosive 
coping strategies, such as selling productive assets or withdrawing children from education (Linnerooth-
Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2014; IPCC, 2012). Box 2 provides evidence of the scale of these ex-post 
benefits at the macroeconomic level. Adaptation has the potential to reduce the costs of financial protection by reducing exposure and 
vulnerability to climate-related disaster and slow onset risks. A study examining a number of Caribbean 
countries found that risk reduction measures could cost-effectively avert up to 90% of projected losses in 
2030 under a high climate change scenario (CCRIF, 2010). Meanwhile, considering adaptation in the 
development of financial protection strategies can make those strategies more effective at managing 
climate risks in the medium and longer term. This provides an opportunity to leverage the growing 
volumes of climate finance and avoid duplication of effort. Financial protection measures can support adaptation by encouraging risk reduction, but existing 
mechanisms are not always designed to do so. At a minimum, financial protection can support adaptation 
by not distorting incentives, for example by ensuring that insurance premiums are based on the underlying 
risk. Some initiatives have gone beyond this by integrating financial protection with risk reduction. The R4 
Rural Resilience Initiative in Ethiopia aims to strengthen food and income security by allowing those ENV/WKP(2017)7 10 insured to partially pay their premiums by engaging in risk reduction activities (World Bank, 2013). 
However, these integrated approaches remain unusual, with a survey of flood insurance mechanisms in 
developing countries finding that few of them make a link between risk transfer and risk reduction 
(Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2013). Box 2. Impact of insurance penetration on economic growth Insurance penetration is strongly linked to GDP per capita. In the period between 2005 and 2014, 
insurance covered less than 10% of disaster losses in developing countries, but approximately 51% of all 
losses in high-income countries (OECD, 2015b). Low-income countries have limited insurance uptake due 
to limited financial markets, lack of familiarity with insurance products and high transaction costs relative 
to the sums insured. Traditional insurance mechanisms are not well-suited to the needs of the poorest 
and most vulnerable in managing their exposure to climate risks (Poole, 2014). Von Peter et al. (2012) analysed a panel dataset covering 203 countries and territories between 
1960 and 2011 to identify the impact of natural catastrophes on economic growth. They find that insured 
events do not affect long-term output (i.e., GDP growth does not diverge significantly from its pre-disaster 
trend), while uninsured events create a cumulated loss in output over 10 years of 2.3% or more 
(see below). Note: The left-side panels show the deviation of real economic growth from its trend due to a typical disaster event for 
an economy with no private insurance coverage and an economy with full insurance coverage. The right-side panels 
show the cumulative deviation of GDP from trend over 10 years for each type of economy. Source: von Peter et al (2012). Even when financial protection succeeds in encouraging people to reduce risks relating to climate 
variability, this does not necessarily mean that it is good for adaptation. Climate change means that the risk 
profile will change over time, but financial protection tends to focus attention on the management of 
current risks. For example, insurance premiums only reflect current risk exposure. This can be a problem if 
measures to address current risks increase vulnerability in the longer term. For example, inappropriate 
reforestation can deplete groundwater supplies (IEG, 2012). The creation of fixed flood defences in some ENV/WKP(2017)7 11 areas may ultimately increase vulnerability by encouraging development in places that will be unsuitable 
under a changed climate. In practice, developing countries are at an early stage in considering how financial protection can be 
linked with adaptation planning. As an illustration, out of a sample of 18 national adaptation plans or 
strategies, 10 countries mentioned the use of financial tools to manage exposure to disaster risks 1 . 
However, all but one of these was narrowly focussed on the use of agricultural insurance rather than 
financial protection more generally. The two policy agendas tend to be managed by different areas of 
government, with the environment ministry often leading the work on adaptation and the financial 
protection strategy being led by the finance ministry. These administrative divides at the national level also 
extend to the international level, where they are governed by separate processes. Bilateral and multilateral development agencies are already playing important roles in providing 
financial resources, capacity building and technical assistance to support financial protection and climate 
change adaptation. Development co-operation providers have increased their support to climate change 
adaptation in the past years, reaching almost USD 19 billion in 2014 (OECD, 2016a). They have also 
contributed to financial protection initiatives, ranging from sovereign risk pools such as the African Risk 
Capacity (ARC) 2 and the Caribbean Climate Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) to mechanisms targeting 
households, such as the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative. The G7 InsuResilience initiative aims to increase 
coverage by 400 million people by 2020. This initiative provides financial support for mechanisms 
including ARC and CCRIF However, despite the progress made to date, development agencies' 
engagement in financial protection is still in the  " early days "  (Poole, 2014). There is, therefore, scope for 
enhanced co-operation to strengthen resilience against climate risks, through better-integrated support for 
financial protection and climate adaptation. 2. 
Finance for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management Analysis of public finance flows provides an indication of the degree of integration between climate 
change adaptation and disaster risk management. It is not currently possible to track public finance for 
financial protection. Development co-operation providers are supporting both disaster risk management and adaptation 
efforts in developing countries. Data from the OECD Development Assistance Committee's (DAC) 
Creditor Reporting System (CRS) provides an indication of trends in this support, including the degree of 
integration between policy agendas. The DAC CRS provides data on all support from DAC members 
down to the level of individual activities. The Rio Marker on Adaptation identifies activities within that 
database for which adaptation was either the principal or a significant motivation for undertaking the 
project or programme. It now also includes activity level data reported by multilateral development banks 
and climate funds for 2013 and 2014 (MDBs. 2015) 3 . There is, however, no equivalent marker to identify expenditure on the management of natural 
hazards, including those related to climate change. Instead, spending allocated to sectors linked to disaster 
risk management can provide an indication of trends in levels of support. The CRS sector classifications 1 The countries were: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, India, 
Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Vanuatu and Zambia. 2 The African Risk Capacity (ARC) was established as a Specialized Agency of the African Union to help member 
states strengthen their capacities to better plan, prepare and respond to the effects of extreme weather events. 3 There are some differences between the methodologies used to track bilateral and multilateral adaptation finance 
flows. ENV/WKP(2017)7 12 chosen for this report are: disaster prevention and preparedness, flood prevention and protection, and 
reconstruction relief and rehabilitation (collectively, the DRM sectors). These sectors were chosen because 
they are most likely to capture relevant activities. Identifying and delineating relevant finance streams is an evolving challenge. Methodological 
difficulties and data gaps mean that the estimates below should be treated as indicative, with further 
research needed to provide a more detailed picture. For example, projects that aim at financing resilience 
to climate risks may be captured under a range of different sectors, including health, education, or water 
management, rather than the sectors linked to disaster risk management. Given that activities to help 
address climate-related risks may fit under different sector codes, a detailed analysis at the activity level 
would be required to capture all relevant flows. Integration of adaptation and disaster risk management The analysis below provides an estimate of resources targeting the DRM sectors that were also 
designed with an adaptation objective, acknowledging that not all relevant activities might be identified. 
The methodology used for this purpose analyses the share of finance flowing to the three key disaster risk 
management sectors (identified above) that are also  " marked "  as climate change adaptation, from both 
bilateral and multilateral providers. There is more overlap between adaptation and DRM expenditure by multilateral donors, than is the 
case for bilateral donors. On average, bilateral providers have allocated USD 10 billion per year between 
2010 and 2014 in adaptation-related ODA commitments, from which USD 580 million per year were 
directed to the three key disaster risk management sectors (5.7% of the total adaptation-related resources). 
By comparison, multilateral providers have provided an average of USD 5 billion per year between 2013 
and 2014 for adaptation, of which USD 1.35 billion per year (24%) supported the same key sectors. While 
adaptation-related disaster risk prevention and preparedness resources from bilateral providers slightly 
decreased between 2013 and 2014, they increased for flood prevention and control, and more so for 
reconstruction, relief and rehabilitation. For multilaterals, amounts increased between the two years 
(see Figure 1). Figure 1. Bilateral (a) and multilateral (b) adaptation-related development finance for key selected sectors Source: authors based on OECD DAC CRS. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 2010

flows. Although the results are very heterogeneous among the providers, flood protection and control is the 
most integrated, with 93% of projects marked as adaptation-related between 2010 and 2014. Of all finance 
flowing to disaster prevention and preparedness, 37% was marked as adaptation-related while for 
reconstruction relief and rehabilitation, 23% 4 was marked as adaptation. For bilateral providers 66% of the 
resources are provided in form of grants and 34% in form of loans. For multilateral providers 96% of the 
adaptation-related resources in the key sectors are in form of loans and only 4% are provided as grants. 
Bilateral and multilateral providers are heavily concentrated, with Japan being the most active by providing 
over 52% of the resources, followed by the EU institutions and Germany. Among the multilateral 
providers, the World Bank Group is dominant, accounting for 89% of the resource flows. Table 1. Bilateral adaptation-related ODA as a share of total ODA flowing to key sectors Key sectors

23% Source: derived from OECD DAC CRS. This analysis of adaptation-related finance in the DRM sectors only provides a general indication of 
the degree of integration of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management development finance 
flows. To provide an in depth-analysis, the project-level data of activities recorded in the DAC CRS for 
Colombia and Senegal were examined to identify adaptation expenditure linked to disaster resilience 
objectives. Specifically, a keyword search was undertaken to identify relevant activities within the whole 
set of adaptation finance, across all sectors. The keywords were: risk, resilience, catastrophes, insurance, 
and disaster. The results of this search are discussed in their respective case studies. Limited evidence on domestic resource flows Domestic resources will be essential for managing the risks that arise from climate change, but few 
countries track these finance flows. All countries were requested to provide information on their 
expenditure on disaster risk management within their Hyogo Framework progress reports. However, few 
have done so, while the lack of a common methodology means that results are not comparable between 
countries. There is even less data available on domestic expenditure on adaptation, although some country 
studies have shed light on this issue. For example, a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review 
(CPEIR) of Bangladesh found that 4% of government spending was linked to climate adaptation in 2014 
(UNDP, n.d.). Kellet et al (2014) examines efforts in disaster risk reduction finance across five countries (Indonesia, 
the Philippines, Mexico, South Africa and Costa Rica). Based on this, and a literature review, it concludes 
that very little comparable evidence can be found and more research is needed in this area. Examples 
where data are available include the Philippines where standalone projects totalling USD 800 million were 
recorded and Indonesia with USD 900 million of recorded projects. 4 The degree of integration for multilateral flows is not relevant, as the climate component does not allow for a similar 
comparison of full amounts of adaptation-related projects vs. non adaptation-related projects. ENV/WKP(2017)7 14 3. 
Overview of financial protection tools In addition to the support for adaptation and disaster risk management described above, development 
co-operation providers are helping to improve the range and quality of financial protection tools. Table 2 
maps the range of tools currently available to their potential users. This section provides context for the 
case studies by providing an introduction to the range of tools available, their characteristics and emerging 
insights on their use. Table 2. Selected financial protection tools by type and potential user Potential users of financial protection tools Tool

appropriate mixes of financial protection tools (GFDRR, 2014a). For example, social protection 
programmes for poor households create liabilities for the government, which can then be offset using tools 
such as sovereign insurance (World Bank, 2016b). In that example, the existence of social protection 
programmes enables the benefits of improved management of sovereign financial liabilities to flow to the 
households who need them most. Providers, in collaboration with governments, private sector insurers and farmers', among others, 
have an essential role to play in supporting the development of individual tools, as well as the development 
of overall strategies. At the project level, modalities have included technical assistance and direct financial 
support to cover setup costs and thereby improve affordability. Providers can also indirectly facilitate these 
mechanisms through support for reforms to strengthen the regulatory and policy environment, improve 
provision of weather data, or expand access to financial services. At the strategic level, donors' technical 
support, financial resources and convening power can support integrated approaches to managing 
climate risks. Financial protection against climate risks for national governments Financial protection at the sovereign level is based on the principle of risk layering, with different 
combinations of tools used depending on the potential size of losses. Risk reduction is used to prevent the 
occurrence of very frequently occurring events. As the scale of losses increases, risks are retained and then ENV/WKP(2017)7 15 transferred. The largest, least frequent events cannot be fully managed ex ante. Instead, they are met 
through ex post mechanisms such as budget reallocation, tax increases and international humanitarian 
relief (OECD/G20, 2012). The layering principle is illustrated in Figure 2 below. Strategies for financial protection can help to assess and manage climate risks, reducing the need for 
unplanned, emergency funding that may arrive late or in insufficient quantity. An illustration of the limits 
of emergency funding is provided by Becerra et al. (2012). They find that the average flow of ODA to 
affected countries increases by 18% after a disaster, but this increase only covers on average 3% of total 
estimated damages from that disaster. Contingency funds, or dedicated budgets for disasters, are a commonly used mechanism for retaining 
risks. They are best suited for the financial management of frequently occurring, but low-impact events 
(Mechler, 2005). This is important given that these events can have large cumulative impacts on people's 
livelihoods, even if they are small when viewed in isolation. Countries that have adopted contingency 
funds for climate risks have also taken measures to insulate the resources from political pressure for 
reallocation. These include moving the fund out of the main budget, with the provision of a clear legal 
framework for how those funds can be used (Phaup & Kirschner, 2010). For example, the budget allocated 
to Mexico's FONDEN operates as a separate trust. When losses exceed the allocated budget, the additional 
costs can be met from ex post measures (e.g. additional taxes, budget reallocation) or through the other 
financial protection instruments described below. Figure 2. Risk layering Source: Adapted from OECD/G20 (2012). Reduce risk Retain risk Transfer risk Residual risk Increasing 
losses ENV/WKP(2017)7 16 Development co-operation providers have pioneered the use of prearranged credit lines to provide 
rapid access to funding following an extreme event. This is a form of risk retention, as the credit has to be 
repaid. Contingent credit lines can be arranged in advance, maintained for a small fee and then made 
available when a specific event occurs (such as a national declaration of a state of emergency). Examples 
include the World Bank's Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO), IADB's Contingent Credit 
Facility for Natural Disaster Emergencies and JICA'S SECURE programme (GFDRR, 2014a). One of the 
main benefits of these credit lines is that resources are available almost immediately following the 
triggering event and are usually provided at more favourable terms than commercial loans. They can also 
serve as an incentive for improved planning, as countries are required to have a risk management plan in 
place as a condition for eligibility. Even credit lines that are small relative to the scale of potential losses 
from disasters can help to cover immediate costs, while longer-term arrangements are made. Pre-existing 
credit lines to manage disaster risks have been used in countries including Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Guatemala, the Philippines and the Seychelles. However, they are only suitable for countries with 
sufficient fiscal space to take on additional debt. As such, they may not be suitable for low income 
countries. Risk transfer instruments, such as insurance, can provide a valuable tool for managing the 
consequences of less-frequent but larger events. These are particularly relevant in developing countries, 
where the government's assets and revenues tend to be limited and concentrated, and where losses can be 
much larger in proportion to GDP. The use of formal risk transfer arrangements also increases 
transparency, as the covered liabilities become visible as budgetary outlays. Provided that premiums are 
linked to the underlying risks, the benefits of investments in risk reduction also become visible. Lastly, 
there is the potential to benefit from the third-party's expertise in risk management. Insurance of public sector assets, such as buildings, is mandatory in many developing countries, 
although this does not necessarily translate into adequate or effective cover. Beyond the insurance of 
specific assets, sovereign-level instruments can provide resources to manage a broader range of risks. 
Governments can purchase reinsurance from international markets to address the consequences of extreme 
events. For example, the Costa Rican government combines self-insurance of public assets with a 
reinsurance contract to cover the risk of unlikely, but high cost events (Ghesquiere and Mahul, 2010). 
Insurance can be provided on the basis of actual losses (indemnity) or if a specified event occurs 
(parametric insurance). Parametric insurance is quicker to disburse and avoids moral hazard, but has the 
downside that the payment received may not be closely correlated with the losses incurred. Countries can also diversify their exposure to extreme events through risk pooling. The pool takes on 
the risk profile of the region, combining individual risks into a calculable risk for the group. This enables 
governments affected by a disaster to rapidly access finance that will enable them to start recovery efforts 
(Linerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2014). Risk pools can be designed to encourage investment in 
risk reduction and ensure their own financial sustainability. The use of a parametric trigger avoids the risk 
of moral hazard because the payment received does not depend on the size of the loss. Current risk pools 
have proactive mechanisms in place to develop capacity for risk management by the pool's members. 
Reinsurance is used to manage the possibility that the pool is exhausted because too many countries are 
eligible for payments in one year. Catastrophe bonds transfer risks to capital markets, providing an alternative or complement to the use 
of reinsurance. These bonds are generally issued by companies, but are slowly expanding to sovereign 
issuers. In essence, these bonds pay investors an above market return, but if a pre-defined event (e.g. 
measured by a parametric threshold such wind speed or rainfall) occurs the investor will lose either the 
interest, or the interest and the principal from the bond (Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2011). The 
implementation of catastrophe bonds requires sophisticated capacity and good data, which limits their 
application to higher-income countries. In 2012, Mexico launched a USD 315 million catastrophe bond ENV/WKP(2017)7 17 that provides coverage against earthquakes and hurricanes, building on the success of the 2009 MultiCat 
Mexico transaction. The Pacific Alliance (Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Peru) countries are currently 
developing a catastrophe bond, initially for earthquake risk but with the potential to extend coverage to 
other hazards. Financial protection against climate risks for the private sector Financial protection tools can help businesses to manage their exposure to climate risks, including 
damage to buildings and business disruption. Agricultural insurance is a particularly important tool in the 
context of climate change. The specific challenges faced by smallholders and subsistence farmers are 
addressed in the following section on households. In the absence of financial risk management measures, farmers manage their exposure to climate and 
market risk by limiting the use of purchased inputs and diversifying production to include crops that are 
less climate-sensitive (World Bank, 2016). In principle, the availability of insurance should provide more 
efficient means of managing these risks. For example, insured farmers may use more credit for agricultural 
inputs (such as fertiliser or improved seeds), as they are more confident about being able to repay the loan 
in the event of unfavourable growing conditions. They can also maximise average output by specialising in 
their most productive crop. However, the uptake of commercial, indemnity-based (i.e. payouts are made on the basis of actual 
losses incurred) agricultural insurance is very low in developing countries. In general, only the largest 
farms purchase cover. In Peru, for example, only 0.7% of cultivated land is covered by commercial 
insurance (GIZ, 2016). In contrast, 43% of German agricultural land is covered by commercial insurance 
on an unsubsidised basis (Diez-Caneja et al, 2009). The underlying reason for low penetration in 
developing countries is that the comparatively small size of insured sums and proportionately high 
administration costs for processing claims. A further constraint is that the potential for moral hazard means 
that some risks, such as pest damage, are not insurable (Hazell, 1992). Index-linked insurance is increasingly being used to overcome these challenges and expand coverage 
to small and medium-sized farms. The largest of these is the India's National Agricultural Insurance 
Scheme (NAIS), which provides coverage to 25 million farmers (Mahul et al., 2012). In addition to this 
large-scale programme, there are a large number of smaller initiatives. The IFC's Global Index Insurance 
Facility, largely focussed on agricultural insurance, has supported insurance for 600 000 people. These 
programmes have provided valuable insights, but total coverage remains limited. A continuing challenge with index-linked insurance has been basis risk, which is the possibility that 
the payments received by the policyholder do not match the losses that they have incurred. This can be 
desirable, if it rewards farmers who have undertaken measures to reduce risks. However, in general, the 
existence of basis risk makes the insurance less attractive, because potential customers are less certain that 
their losses will be covered. Pilot programmes can be used to address the two underlying causes of basis 
risk: weaknesses in product design and insufficiently detailed weather data (IFC, n.d.). Careful design of 
the index can help to calibrate payments to potential losses. Technological innovation, in particular the use 
of remote sensing, has potential to provide geographically detailed information in the absence of weather 
stations (Hochrainer-Stigler et al, 2014). Development co-operation providers are increasingly focussing on supporting the basic financial 
market infrastructure for insurance rather than providing subsidies. Improvements in the market 
infrastructure can then help to expand coverage and bring down the cost of insurance. Methods include 
data collection, regulatory reforms and client education and outreach (GFDRR, 2011a). Subsidies can help 
to increase coverage, but even heavily subsidised programmes can struggle to achieve scale. Moreover, the ENV/WKP(2017)7 18 payment of subsidises can distort production decisions and create significant costs for governments and 
donors. Any subsidies need to be carefully design and complemented with other types of support. Financial protection against climate risks for poorer households and the informal sector Poor households often have limited ability to reduce their vulnerability to climate risks. For example, 
they may lack the resources to invest in risk-reduction measures, such as raising their dwellings to reduce 
flood risk. Even in good years, this vulnerability slows the advance towards higher income, which is a key 
determinant of adaptive capacity. In bad years, the lack of mechanisms to address extreme events can lead 
to a negative cycle, as households are forced into taking measures that ultimately erode their earning 
potential. Governments, with the support of donors, can support resilience by improving the variety, 
quality and suitability of instruments available for managing climate risks. A major international initiative 
on this is detailed in Box 3. Social protection is particularly important tool for supporting poorer 
household's capacity to manage the financial consequences of extreme events (World Bank 2016b). Micro-insurance has been developed to meet the needs of households by offering coverage for small 
amounts of losses at low premiums. Providers of micro-insurance aim to keep costs down through 
innovations in the cover offered, the delivery channels used or the use of technology (e.g. mobile 
payments). Pilots of index-based micro-insurance providing low-income households with financial 
coverage for climate risks have been carried out in Bolivia, Malawi, India, Mongolia, Sudan, and Ethiopia, 
among others (Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2013). ENV/WKP(2017)7 19 Box 3. The G7 InsuResilience Initiative The G7 Climate Risk Insurance Initiative (InsuResilience) was launched at the G7 summit in Elmau in June 2015, 
highlighting the importance of financial risk transfer concepts, particularly for emerging and developing countries. The 
initiative aims to increase coverage of both direct and indirect insurance for climate risks for over 400 million people in 
developing countries by 2020. At COP22 in November 2016, the G7 countries increased their commitment to 
USD 550 million (up from the USD 420 million announced at COP21) of public funds. This funding is enabling the 
delivery of a rapid action package, which includes support for ARC, CCRIF and the rollout of a Pacific Catastrophe 
Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI). In the short term, InsuResilience focusses on expanding and capitalizing existing indirect insurance facilities and 
initiatives such as the African Risk Capacity (ARC), the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment & Financing Initiative 
(PCRAFI) and the Caribbean and Central American Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF). The initiative plans 
on expanding its coverage of countries and products over time. In the medium to long term, the focus will shift to 
providing direct insurance and working closely with the private sector. GIZ and KfW, under the mandate of BMZ, are 
playing a leading role in promoting this initiative, in close collaboration with Munich Re. GIZ is establishing a secretariat 
to accelerate the implementation of the Initiative, under the framework of their program on Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Adaptation to Climate Change. Source: GIZ (2016), Climate Risk Insurance Initiative for strengthening resilience of

http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/adaptationfutures2016?referaat=%22PR8.9%22. Experience gained from implementing insurance programmes to date has revealed some significant 
challenges in expanding coverage (Wolfrom and Yokoi-Arai, 2015; Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2013; 
Surminski et al, 2015):  Coverage of insurance for climate risks remains low among developing countries and, 
particularly, vulnerable groups within those countries. 
 Affordability remains a challenge for particularly vulnerable groups of people, with the 
expansion of coverage being constrained by the availability of domestic and external public 
funding. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Direct insurance Indirect insurance Beneficiaries Increment

coverage dependent upon availability of external resources. 
 Reducing basis risk 5 remains a challenge with index-linked products, particularly where weather 
data is patchy or incomplete. 
 Links with proactive risk reduction remain weak in many insurance mechanisms in developing 
countries.  Pilot programmes often have to address the lack of basic market infrastructure for insurance, such 
as data to help set premiums, payment systems and raising awareness about the value of 
insurance. Insurance is only one potential element of a risk management strategy. Social protection measures 
encompass a range of mechanisms that transfer income or assets to the poor, including cash transfers, asset 
transfers, public works schemes and input subsidies (Bene et al., 2014). In contrast to insurance, eligibility 
for social protection is based on need, rather than the payment of a premium. Social protection 
programmes can work in concert with insurance provision: for example, in Kenya, there is a layered 
system for farmers, which provides social protection for the most vulnerable farmers, subsidised premiums 
for poorer farmers and unsubsidised insurance for those with higher incomes (World Bank, 2015). Sufficient, targeted and scalable social protection can help poor and vulnerable households to manage 
their exposure to climate risks without having to engage in erosive coping strategies (Davies et al, 2009). It 
can strengthen resilience over time by improving households' adaptive capacity and preventing them from 
falling into poverty. Heltberg et al (2009) emphasise the value of having mechanisms in place to quickly 
adjust coverage of existing mechanisms, so that the assistance can flow to the people and areas affected. 
This can be achieved through the development of socio-economic registers, which allow recipients to be 
readily identified following a disaster. Works programmes can use self-targeting, where the payment of a 
below-market wage restricts participation to those otherwise unable to find employment 
(World Bank, 2016b). More generally, development interventions to support financial inclusion have the potential to 
reinforce people's ability to manage climate risks. Savings, borrowing and remittances are widely used 
strategies for managing exposure. For example, when Agrawala and Carraro (2010) analysed micro-
finance portfolios in Bangladesh, they found that 70% of the borrowing was related to climate change 
adaptation. Meanwhile, mobile payment mechanisms have been found to reduce transaction costs, and also 
support households' ability to share risks (CGAP, 2014). 4. 
Colombia case study The 2010-2011 La Niña floods led to significant reforms to the management of natural hazards in 
Colombia. The floods caused damages of USD 6 billion and affected 3.2 million people nationally, while 
some regions experienced losses equivalent to 15% of their GDP (ECLAC, 2012). It resulted in 
strengthened efforts to reduce the drivers of risk, improve financial management and adapt to climate 
change. Although this event was extreme, it occurred against a backdrop of rising recorded losses over time 
and growth in the underlying drivers of vulnerability. Colombia's geography leaves it highly exposed to 5 Basis risk exists when the insurance payout received by the policyholder does not reflect the actual losses that they 
have suffered. This is likely to occur when there is a weak correlation between the chosen index (e.g. precipitation in 
a given area) and losses (e.g. loss of agricultural output by the policy holder). ENV/WKP(2017)7 21 climate-related hazards, including floods and landslides. This is compounded by deep-seated socio-
economic challenges, including high income inequality: in 2013, average GDP per capita was just over 
USD 8 000, but 6% of the population were living on less than USD 1.90 (PPP) per day 
(World Bank, 2016a). Armed conflict has weakened state capacities in some regions, and driven people 
from rural areas to informal urban settlements in risk prone areas. In addition, environmental degradation, 
including persistent, large scale deforestation is contributing to the severity of extreme events, increasing 
their impacts on people and infrastructure. Shortcomings in the design and implementation of land-use planning instruments rendered them 
ineffective in stemming the accumulation of vulnerability. The World Bank (2012a) estimates that 12% of 
the population live in areas that are highly exposed to flood risk. Meanwhile, there has been a lack of 
resources for investment in risk reduction, particularly in small, remote or less developed municipalities. 
Other major policy challenges have included capacity constraints, the pressure of accommodating 
displaced populations and misalignments between administrative boundaries and natural borders. The weather in Colombia is heavily influenced by the La Niña / El Niño cycle. During a La Niña 
event, increased rainfall is mainly associated with floods and landslides, which in turn can lead to crop 
failure, livestock losses, food shortages, increased vector-borne diseases, respiratory diseases, and food and 
water borne diseases. El Niño by contrast creates a water deficit, which in conditions of vulnerability can 
be translated into drought, reduced access to potable water, increased food and water-borne diseases, 
diarrheal diseases, land degradation and desertification, food shortages, and forest fires (Bello, 2011). Climate change is projected to affect weather trends in Colombia. Based on historical weather data, 
IDEAM has identified the following broad trends arising from climate change from this cycle (DNP, 2012; 
IDEAM, 2012; IDEAM, 2015): rising temperatures, increased precipitation and shrinking glaciers. In the 
future, temperatures are projected to continue increasing. Precipitation will decrease in the Caribbean and 
Andean regions and increase in the central and northern Pacific region. One study suggests that the 
likelihood of extreme El Niño events will increase in the future due to climate change (Cai et al, 2014). Many studies have been conducted on the economic and social impacts of climate change in 
Colombia, predominantly on an ad hoc basis. The most influential at the national level has been a joint 
study on the Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Colombia (DNP-BID, 2014). This was developed by 
the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), Colombia's Department of 
National Planning (DNP) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). This examined some of the 
most climate-sensitive sectors (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and transport), which combined 
accounted for 4.3% of Colombia's GDP in 2005-2012. The impacts of climate change in these sectors were 
projected to reduce Colombia's total GDP by an average of 0.5% per year. In addition to these studies, a 
national vulnerability analysis, including detail at the departmental scale, is being produced as part of the 
3 rd National Communication to the UNFCCC. This is intended to improve consistency and set a benchmark 
for more detailed studies. Although these general trends have been identified, Colombia currently lacks the historical data 
needed to comprehensively understand and manage climate risks. Coverage of weather data is uneven, 
with the best coverage being available in the Andean and Caribbean regions, which is where the bulk of 
people and assets are located. A study by the state Fund for Financing the Agricultural Sector 
(FINAGRO, 2015a) found that only two of Colombia's 32 departments have sufficient meteorological and 
hydrological data coverage (more than 1 station for every 100km 2 of territory) to offer catastrophe 
insurance for agriculture. The government is increasing coverage of weather stations, assisted in part by 
investments through the Colombian Adaptation Fund. This should help to improve coverage in currently 
underserved areas. This will not be a quick fix, however, as several decades of historical weather data are 
required to identify the underlying trends in climate. In the meantime, improved coverage could yield near-ENV/WKP(2017)7 22 term benefits such as facilitating the introduction of index-based insurance and the development of early-
warning systems. In addition to gaps in the available weather data, there is also incomplete data on the impacts of 
extreme events. The national system for recording information on disasters (SIGPAD) has been reinforced 
with support from the World Bank, but has yet to achieve complete sectoral and geographical coverage. A 
particular challenge lies with recording of data on smaller but more frequent events, with relevant 
information either not recorded or not consolidated into the system. These smaller events are 
predominantly related to landslides and flooding. Although their individual impacts may appear small, the 
cumulative impact is substantial. The current data cover the period between 1970 and 2010 and estimate 
almost USD 3 billion in losses. 6 Primary research, such as analysing newspaper archives, is being used to 
provide a more complete picture of historical trends, including the most recent La Niña events. A common 
proxy for the estimation of losses has been to use data from the housing sector, where the majority of 
losses are reported. Institutional and policy framework The overall framework for managing climate risks is provided by Colombia's National Development 
Plans, the National Adaptation Plan and the National Risk Management Plan. The National Development 
Plans are used to set priorities and guide the allocation of resources for each presidential term. The Plans 
are developed by the National Planning Department, working together with each sector, and then 
implemented as laws. Although there is an increased emphasis on integration in these documents, the 
institutional arrangements for managing climate risks are not closely linked in practice. Colombia's approach to climate change is coordinated through the National Climate Change System 
(SISCLIMA). This was proposed in 2011 and operated in an ad-hoc way prior to being formally approved 
by decree in February 2016. This system includes a set of institutional mechanisms for strengthening 
coordination between sectors at the national level, in addition to the regional level. Some of the key 
elements that were in operation even prior to formal approval include the committees on financial 
management and international affairs, which have been facilitating coordination between the relevant 
ministries. At the regional level, the ministry of environment has a coordination mechanism to bring 
together relevant actors. The new formal structure incorporates these elements, but is intended to be 
streamlined and made more operational compared to that proposed in the 2011 document. Colombia has taken an unusual route in the development of its national adaptation plan, which is 
known as the PNACC. Instead of having a single document that sets out a top-down approach, the PNACC 
is conceived as a toolbox to support local and sectoral adaptation actions (DNP et al, 2012). The toolbox 
consists of the general principles for adaptation, combined with technical guidance. This reflects the vital 
importance of territorial land planning tools, such as the Territorial Management Plans (POTs), in reducing 
vulnerability. Nonetheless, having produced the toolbox, the Colombian government is now producing a 
single overview document that will set out its overall national approach to adaptation. In addition, the government is currently exploring whether to introduce a climate change law. At 
present, the system is based on the SISCLIMA decree and the government programmes set out in the 
national development plans. Implementation relies heavily upon voluntary initiatives, supported by the 
toolbox provided by the PNACC. The motivation for introducing legislation would be to provide a 
legislative basis for adaptation actions, potentially including economic instruments or regulatory reforms. 
It would also help to increase the clarity and perceived permanence of the system. 6 USD 2006. ENV/WKP(2017)7 23 Disaster risk management has a more established legal basis in Colombia than adaptation. The Law 
1523 of 2012 provides the current framework, which establishes that risk management is the responsibility 
of all actors in society. It contributed to the National System for Disaster Risk Management (SNGRD in 
Spanish), which brings together relevant actors to understand, reduce and address the impacts of disasters. 
It includes a legal requirement for central and local government to assess the risks of disasters under their 
remit. This framework is designed to address some of the underlying drivers of risk discussed in the 
previous section. In particular, there is now a requirement that disaster risk management be mainstreamed 
into development, territorial (POTs), coastal (POMIUAC) and water basin management plans (POMCAs). 
This requirement applies to municipalities, which are responsible for developing POTs, and the regional 
level, which covers POMCAs and POMIUACs. The requirement for disaster risk to be considered in 
development plans is particularly significant, as these plans affect spending decisions. Moreover, 
departments and municipalities with a population larger than 250 000 inhabitants must have a risk 
management entity. However, the implementation of these requirements remains limited. Following the 2010-11 floods, the Finance Ministry (MHCP) issued a Disaster Risk Finance and 
Insurance (DRFI) policy strategy in 2013, which established a guiding framework for implementing a 
three-pronged approach to managing the fiscal consequences of natural disasters. The elements of this are: 1. Improving the evidence base on the fiscal consequences of natural disasters 2. Developing a comprehensive strategy for the financial management of natural disasters 3. Insuring public assets against catastrophic risks These elements have been supplemented by capacity building at the central and sub-national level. 
Additionally, a long-term operative plan will support implementation of the DRFI policy strategy. The national development plan and the Law 1523 of 2012 make the connection explicit between 
relevant policy areas, but in practice the coordination among the institutions and the sharing of data could 
be improved. The environment ministry and finance ministries are starting to explore how financial 
protection can facilitate and support the adaptation process. This will entail better integrating the relevant 
institutions, developing shared conceptual understandings and concretely examining the implications of 
specific policies for adaptation. The development of the adaptation strategy for the finance sector would 
provide an opportunity to move this agenda forward. Meanwhile, the long-term operative plan for the 
Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategy also provides an opportunity to better coordinate with 
adaptation policies. Finance for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management Analysis of finance flows can shed light on overall trends and the degree of integration between 
relevant policy agendas, but there are significant data limitations and methodological challenges in doing 
so. This section aims at providing an overview of finance targeting the management of climate risks using 
available data both from the Colombian government for domestic flows and from the DAC CRS for 
international flows from development co-operation providers. International financial resources for adaptation and disaster risk management The amount of bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) directed to adaptation in Colombia 
increased from 2010 to 2014, when it reached USD 117 million (see Figure 3). The share of ODA marked 
as principally adaptation, implying activities designed with the primary objective of contributing to the 
adaptation to climate change in the country, has shown great variability, with principal activities 
accounting for 84% of the total in 2014 but only 20% of bilateral adaptation-related ODA in 2011. ENV/WKP(2017)7 24 Figure 3. Adaptation related ODA of DAC members in Colombia (2010-2014) Source: Authors with data from DAC CRS. The largest bilateral provider of funding is France, followed by Spain, the United States and 
Switzerland (OECD-DAC CRS 2016). The largest multilateral providers, according to the OECD DAC's 
CRS are the Inter-American development Bank (IDB) and the international Adaptation Fund established 
under the UNFCCC. However, very few projects have been reported as targeting adaptation in Colombia 
from multilateral sources since 2013. Notably, the World Bank's Development Policy Loan linked to 
natural disasters is not included, although this is likely to support climate adaptation by addressing the 
underlying drivers of exposure to climate risks. A keyword search of project descriptions 7 provides an indication of how much of the finance 
committed to adaptation was directly linked to disaster risk management and might not be contained in the 
three disaster-related sectors 8 . The detailed word search shows that USD 6.9 million of activities between 
2010 and 2014 were targeting adaptation and financial protection objectives from bilateral sources. For 
multilateral providers, the activity level search showed that the three projects were included in the key 
sectors (USD 89 million). However, some potentially relevant projects were not marked as adaptation 
(including the Cat DDO and associated measures), which suggests that examination of all development 
finance flows may identify some additional projects. Use of domestic resources to fund disaster risk management and adaptation measures: national and 
subnational level Overall, public spending on climate change (including mitigation) and DRM was approximately 
USD 660 million in 2013, growing from approximately USD 490 million in 2011. This rise can be 
explained by the increase in risk prevention activities implemented by municipalities in 2013. From this 7 Development finance data for Colombia were examined in depth by performing a detailed activity-level keyword 
search across the activities marked with the adaptation marker. The keywords used were  " disaster risk " ,  " resilience " ,

Share of adaptation of total ODA ENV/WKP(2017)7 25 amount, 58% was dedicated to adaptation. The main actors in financing climate change-related investments 
are the municipalities (43%), followed by the Environmental Regional Authorities. The national budget 
accounts for only 12% of total expenditure in this area. In terms of sectoral investments, the largest 
categories receiving public resources for climate change investments were environment and sustainable 
development (66%), risk management (30%) (including only adaptation-related investments and not 
regular DRM projects or reconstruction projects), mining and energy (0.12%), housing (0.55%) and 
agriculture and pasture (4%). For the territories, there are several possible uses of the potentially allocable 
resources for purposes of environmental conservation and climate change. These resources include those 
for drinking water and basic sanitation, as well as freely allocable resources. Investment in disaster risk management primarily takes place at the national and regional levels. In 
the period 2006 – 2014, planned investment in disaster risk management at national level amounted to 
USD 7 billion, which represented 1% of total national government investment (Government of 
Colombia, 2015). From this amount, 2% was targeted to knowledge activities, 9% for risk reduction and 
90% for risk management. Municipalities spent USD 10 billion in this area albeit over a longer time period 
(2002 to 2014), while departments invested a further USD 1 billion. Figure 4. Allocation of national disaster risk management budget across strategic objectives Source: adapted from UNGRD (2015). During this time, a La Niña event in 2010-2011 led to reforms of the disaster financing system, 
including the creation of the domestic Adaptation Fund in 2010. This was established to identify, develop 
and manage projects in the areas affected by La Niña. However, the Fund has subsequently been given a

Management and environmental policies and climate change management. The National Disaster Risk Management Plan has a budget of USD 3.5 billion for the period from 
2015-2025, with approximately 87% dedicated to risk reduction activities of current risks. These activities 
include financial protection and inclusion of climate change adaptation into territorial and sectorial 
planning (see Figure 4). During the interviews conducted for this case study, it was stressed by several 
stakeholders that most of the resources are directed towards reaction, leaving too little for prevention 
activities and resilience building projects. Financial protection instruments being used in Colombia Colombia uses a wide spectrum of tools to manage its financial exposure to climate-related risks. 
Some of these support households directly, while others can indirectly support households' resilience by 
supporting the ability of businesses and the public sector to manage risk. Table 3 shows the range of 
instruments being implemented in Colombia. Table 3. Spectrum of financial protection measures Financial protection tool Level of risk coverage National or sovereign

for disaster losses: 
emergency assistance Sovereign level Colombia's Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategy aims to ensure that the government has 
the option of responding promptly to losses, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal balance. 
Analysis by the finance ministry shows that the average direct exposure to natural hazards, including 
earthquakes, is USD 490 million per year (World Bank, 2012a). However, there is significant tail risk, 
with the costs of a 1 in 100 year event estimated at USD 3 billion under current climate conditions (1.2% 
of GDP) (World Bank, 2012a). Separate analysis by ECLAC shows that climate change could result in ENV/WKP(2017)7 27 impacts on the scale of the 2010-2011 flooding becoming a regular event, but this has yet to be 
incorporated into the modelling of financial exposure. The financial consequences of extreme events are managed by the finance ministry as part of its remit 
of managing contingent liabilities 9 . This type of institutional structure is recommended by the OECD's 
Recommendation on Disaster Financing Strategies, as the finance ministry has oversight and influence 
over spending decisions across government ministries. This system is underpinned by the legal 
requirement for public entities to account for their exposure to contingent risks (MHCP, 2012). Previously, 
the focus had been on the management of explicit liabilities, which are those resulting from legal 
requirements or contractual provisions, such as debt guarantees. However, it is being expanded to cover the 
management of implicit  " passive "  liabilities, such as losses from natural catastrophes. The financial protection strategy is focussed on the management of potential central government 
financial liabilities. The management of local government liabilities does not fall directly under this 
system, but some aspects are addressed in the national law for disaster risk management (Government of 
Colombia, 2012). There is, however, no policy for managing the financial consequences of extreme events 
for households or businesses, for example by encouraging the use of insurance. However, some of the 
measures in this strategy – such as improving data availability – may have ancillary benefits beyond the 
central government. Additionally, the insurance guidelines generated for central government are being 
communicated to local governments. Strengthening data on the potential fiscal consequences of disasters is viewed as a prerequisite for 
their effective management. A major gap that this strategy intends to fill is the lack of data on assets owned 
by the government, their exposure to disaster risk and the existence of insurance coverage. There is 
currently a pilot programme using a web-based system to create and maintain a comprehensive inventory 
of public assets, insurance policies and incurred claims. The other aspect of improving the evidence base is to improve understanding of the costs of previous 
events, and use modelling to examine how these could evolve in future. This is important for developing 
the strategy, raising awareness of the potential risks that it will be managing and increasing the feasibility 
of specific instruments. In general, poor information on risk equates to expensive premiums or coverage 
not being available. Insurers, or other third parties, will be wary about assuming uncertain risks. As a 
consequence, improvements in data can lead to cheaper premiums. A remaining challenge for this strategy is to strengthen the links between risk reduction and financial 
protection, building on progress to date. The World Bank has supported an integrated approach to this 
issue through its technical and financial support. The first contingent credit (USD 150 million) was 
packaged with a broader set of measures (USD 260 million) aiming to strengthen the management of 
disaster risks. These risk reduction measures included:  Supporting the development of 688 municipal risk reduction plans  Technical support to underpin the production of 15 POMCAs and 25 POTs  Assistance with the development of risk maps and support for disaster information Law 1523 of 2012 requires the three government levels (national, departmental and municipal) in the 
country to formulate, implement and evaluate Disaster Risk Management Plans to orient, prioritise and 
focus initiatives and investments to diminish vulnerability in territories against natural disasters. 9 Contingent fiscal liabilities are expenses that would be incurred by the government if a certain event occurs. ENV/WKP(2017)7 28 Departments and municipalities are also required to create Disaster Risk Management Funds to finance and 
implement disaster risk management processes (knowledge reduction and management of disaster risks). 
Currently, 91% of departments have formulated plans and 78% of municipalities have created plans. All of 
the departments and 64% of the municipalities have created disaster risk management funds. The 
legislation does not, however, define the size of these funds. The financial protection strategy is comprehensive, ranging from frequent low-severity events to rare 
but high impact events. It consists of a layered approach to managing the financial consequences of natural 
disasters, which is consistent with good practice in this area (G20/OECD, 2012). The underlying principle 
is for the government to retain smaller and more frequent losses. Losses from rarer, but larger events are 
transferred to the private sector or international partners. Very extreme events are not cost-effective to 
transfer, so they would have to be absorbed through ex-post measures. In practice, however, the system is 
more nuanced than this, as the characteristics of each tranche (e.g. data required, risks covered and speed 
of payment) also need to be considered. These layers are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Multi-layer risk financing strategy for natural disasters Source: Ministry of Finance (2013). These layers are now being put in place, with the aim of creating a portfolio of instruments that 
matches both the scale of losses, and the timing of disbursements relative to needs (response, recovery, and 
reconstruction phases), taking into account a cost benefit evaluation. The resources from these layers are 
brought together into a single account, called  " Colombia Humanitaria " . This subaccount included 
resources from different budgets, such as the national budget, the liquidity obtained from the Cat DDO, 
department and municipal budgets, as well as external donations from cooperation agencies 
(MHCP, 2012). The base layer of the system is provided by the National Fund for Disaster Risk Management, created 
by Law 1523 in 2012. The resources for this fund are provided from general taxation. The majority of its 
USD 166 million annual funding is for addressing the consequences of disasters, but 9% is being allocated 
to risk reduction (UNGRD, 2015). Since June 2015, the fund has been part of the National System of ENV/WKP(2017)7 29 Disaster Risk Management and it now may structure and execute comprehensive projects for risk reduction 
and adaptation to climate change. This is intended to strengthen the disaster risk management system and 
help reduce fiscal vulnerability of the state. Colombia has arranged a series of contingent credits with the World Bank. The risk ultimately 
remains with the government, but this instrument provides greater flexibility and immediate access to 
resources in the aftermath of a disaster. This helps to avoid the need for disruptive, emergency budget 
reassignments. The first Cat DDO (Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option) was approved in 2008 for 
USD 150 million, replacing a previous contingent credit. The essence of this instrument is that the 
Colombian government could rapidly borrow up to that ceiling following the declaration of a national 
natural disaster. This occurred at the end of 2010, when the full value of the Cat DDO was accessed to 
address immediate needs following the floods. In a subsequent evaluation, the World Bank (2012b) noted 
that one of the Cat DDO's benefits was that it helped to reassure financial markets and the population that 
the situation was under control. Following the positive experience with the first Cat DDO, the Colombian 
government has subscribed to a new Cat DDO for USD 250 million in 2012. This instrument is currently 
active until 2018, but can be extended up to a maximum of 15 years. The Cat DDO directly contributes to the management of current climate variability, but also makes an 
indirect contribution to longer-term climate change adaptation. This is because countries are required to 
adopt measures to reduce disaster risk as a condition of having access to this loan and these measures will 
have long-term benefits. In Colombia, a key benefit should arise from the measures to redirect 
development away from high risk areas, which will lead to long term benefits. The Cat DDO is also 
accompanied by improvements in data collection, which should assist with planning over the time horizons 
relevant for climate change. Insurance of public assets and PPPs Public bodies are legally required to insure their assets against catastrophe risk, with the aim of 
reducing the government's exposure to disaster risks and supporting fiscal management. However, an 
insurance diagnosis for 23 public entities at central level showed that implementation of this requirement 
could be improved. It has been implemented in a decentralised manner, without guidelines, with each 
public body responsible for meeting its own requirements. As a consequence, there was no central 
oversight of the coverage and adequacy of insurance policies, meaning that the government's total fiscal 
exposure was unclear (World Bank, 2012a). Furthermore, the piecemeal purchase of insurance coverage 
prevented the government from benefitting from economies of scale and risk diversification in the public 
sector estate. Initial steps have been taken to improve the transparency and quality of public sector insurance in the 
public estate. A pilot web platform managed by the Federation of Insurance Companies (FASECOLDA) 
has been created to collect systematic data on the availability of public sector assets, insurance policies and 
claims, but this is still at an early stage. In the meantime, the finance ministry has negotiated access to the 
insurance companies' datasets, albeit under restrictive conditions that were agreed to safeguard commercial 
sensitivity. The other step taken to improve coverage has been the gradual development of standardised 
insurance contracts for public assets, with standard guidance being produced to inform the development of 
insurance contracts. Insurance arrangements for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are being strengthened. With each 
successive set of transport concessions, the aim has been to shift more of the risks to the operators on the 
basis that they are best placed to manage those risks. This was given further urgency when the 2010-2011 
floods revealed weaknesses in the previous allocation of risks between parties. Risks that had been 
contractually allocated to the concessionaires were ultimately assumed by the government, because the ENV/WKP(2017)7 30 scale of the losses and the need to build back better meant that it was no longer commercially viable to 
continue with the contract. Concessionaires have to hold sufficient insurance to cover their expected 
Probable Maximum Loss. The insurance policies are renewed every five years, with the risk of future 
premium increases being held by the concessionaire. Catastrophe bond Colombia is working with the other Pacific Alliance countries (Mexico, Peru and Chile) to develop a 
catastrophe bond. This will initially be for earthquake risk, but with a view to covering other hazards in the 
future. However, the finance ministry is currently analysing the business case for transferring (instead of 
retaining) weather risks via this bond, given the high exposure of Colombia to hydro-meteorological 
hazards. The projected frequency of covered events will be critical, as this instrument is best suited to 
manage infrequently occurring events. Private sector The role of the private sector's participation in adaptation and risk reduction activities is multiple: it is 
both a provider of financial protection and a potential beneficiary. The private sector is also supporting the 
development of innovative technologies to improve early warning systems, data quality and data usage for 
risk reduction purposes. Experience with insurance has been mixed: a major focus has been on improving the transfer of risks 
from the government to the insurance industry. However, experience in the agricultural sector has 
illustrated the difficulty of transferring risks from the private sector to insurers. The Colombian 
Government included the goal of implementing risk management instruments (market and climate risk) 
under the Agricultural Policy pillar of the National Development Plan. The agriculture ministry has 
introduced a series of instruments and strategies, both in risk prevention and mitigation as well as in risk 
transfer (MINAGRO, 2016). The ministry, recognising the importance of protecting farmers from the 
impacts of climate change, subsidises premium costs up to 80%, depending on the size of the producer. 
Coverage has increased from 30 000 hectares in 2009 to 187 000 hectares in 2015. However, this still only 
represents 3% of the total agricultural land area. The insurance (Seguro Agropecuario) covers natural risks 
such as excess or deficit rainfall, high winds, floods, frost, hailstorms, landslides and avalanches; and 
biological risks such as pests or diseases. The insurance product, as well as the incentive for rural capitalisation that fosters sustainable and 
resilience investments for farmers (Incentivo a la Capitalizacion Rural, ICR) is part of an integral strategy 
to reduce, prevent and manage the impacts of natural disaster risk. This includes an Agriculture Risk 
Information System, which is jointly managed by the agriculture ministry, the Rural Agriculture Planning 
Unit (UPRA) and the Agricultural Financing Fund (FINAGRO), as well as technical support programmes 
to provide financial education to farmers. Outputs include short-term forecasts on climate and guidance on 
what crops are most suitable for different types of land, as well as a pilot project for an early warning 
agroclimatic system. UPRA is also developing maps to help target production subsidies to the most 
suitable crops in certain areas. It is also providing guidance to farmers to help them make better-informed 
decisions about managing climate risks. Household level Colombia is not strongly equipped with mechanisms for the financial protection of households against 
natural disasters. For example, uptake of insurance of private assets is slow, and limited to higher income 
households. Analysis by FASECOLDA showed that only 7% of the asset losses from the 2010-2011 La 
Niña were covered by insurance (OECD, 2014). There are several reasons for that: (i) lack of awareness ENV/WKP(2017)7 31 about financial protection mechanisms; (ii) lack of products targeted to the most vulnerable populations, 
who are usually the most impacted by disasters; and (iii) a perception that the government will  " take care "  
of the disaster, paying for the recovery and relocation costs. This perception arises from the Colombian 
constitution, which sets out a number of areas in which the government is obliged to provide 
compensation. The Program  " Familias en Accion "  is a conditional cash transfer programme that enables vulnerable 
households to receive direct cash transfers to spend on education and health services. The programme is 
designed to break the poverty cycle and improve vulnerable populations' resilience, empowering women to 
be the ones taking the decisions and leading the provision of care in the household. The potential links with 
disaster risk reduction activities are strong. However, there has not been any experience in adjusting the 
resources of the programme to extend to resilience building activities in the context of extreme climatic 
events. 5. 
Senegal case study Senegal's ecosystems, economy and society are highly vulnerable to climate change. The main 
climate hazards posing a threat to the country are: increasing temperatures and erratic precipitation causing 
drought, higher incidence of pluvial flooding and related health epidemics. Senegal is also vulnerable to 
sea-level rise, coastal flooding and coastal erosion. Approximately one-fifth of Senegal's coastline is 
highly vulnerable to flooding. Coastal storms and other extreme events from the sea damage people's 
livelihoods. These hazards, particularly droughts and flooding, are already causing repeated losses and 
decreasing people's resilience, especially for the most vulnerable. Senegal suffers from the effects of both two much and too little water. Droughts have been occurring 
sporadically for several decades in Senegal, with eight severe droughts having occurred since 1977. The 
drought in 2011 led to a decrease in grain production of 20% and groundnut production of 31%, exposing 
around 800 000 people to food insecurity. Most of those affected depended on agriculture for their 
subsistence. Droughts have been a key driver for migration from rural to urban areas (GFDRR, 2010). At 
the same time, floods are a frequent occurrence in Senegal, and have affected around 400 000 to 600 000 
people per year on average between 1980 and 2008 (GFDRR, 2014b). These floods are caused by heavy 
rains making rivers overflow or accumulating on impermeable surfaces and causing damages in urban 
areas such as Dakar and Kaolack. Storm surges also lead to salt-water intrusion into agricultural lands, 
particularly in the Saloum Delta near the river Gambia. Urban flooding is a particular challenge in Senegal, as the effects of uncontrolled urban growth are 
exacerbated by the lack of a functional storm water drainage system. There is widespread non-compliance 
with the urban planning and development master plan. The long dry period from 1980 to 1990 favoured the 
installation of a part of the growing population in low-level areas that were vulnerable to flooding. This 
development reduced the soil infiltration potential, leading to increased flood risk in the main Senegalese 
cities. In 2014, around 76% of urban areas were classified as unplanned settlements (GFDRR, 2014b). In 
2009, torrential rainfalls caused USD 82 million of losses nationwide, predominantly in the Dakar region 
(GFDRR, 2014b). Senegal's adaptive capacity is limited by high poverty levels. Senegal is classified as a Low Income 
Country (LIC), and its GNI per capita has been stable at around USD 1 000 since 2010 (World Bank, 
2016a). 10 In 2010, 57% of people in rural areas were recorded as living below the national poverty line 
compared to 33% in urban areas (World Bank, 2016a). The economic structure of Senegal is heavily 
dependent on rain fed agriculture and fisheries, both heavily affected by climate change and natural 10 http://data.worldbank.org/country/senegal. ENV/WKP(2017)7 32 disasters. Agriculture supports the livelihoods of 60% of the Senegalese and employs three quarters of the 
workforce, with family farms representing 95% of the sector's activity (MEDD, 2016). Fisheries are the 
second most important source of employment and livelihoods in Senegal, but fish stocks are already 
affected by overfishing (UNDP, 2004). Current and projected impacts of climate change, including on physical conditions Climate change has affected precipitation and temperature in Senegal. Sahelian rainfall is 
characterised by high variability on inter‐annual and inter‐decadal timescales, which can make long‐term 
trends difficult to identify. Nonetheless, Senegal has experienced a statistically significant decrease of 10 
to 15 mm per decade in wet season rainfall between 1960 and 2006, with the 500 mm isohyet 11 moving 
about 100 km to the south (GFDRR, 2011). Mean temperatures in Senegal have risen by 0.9°C since 1960 
(ibid) and mean rainfall volume has decreased by 30% since 1950 (MEDD, 2016). Future climate change is projected to lead to a hotter, drier climate. Mean annual temperatures are 
projected to increase by 1.1 to 3.1°C by the 2060s, and 1.7 to 4.9°C by the 2090s, with warming projected 
to be faster in the interior than in those areas closer to the coast (McSweeney et al., 2008). Different 
models project a wide range of changes in the mean annual rainfall averaged over the country, from ‐41 to 
+48% by the 2090s, but the majority of models show decreases and it is likely that a greater proportion of 
precipitation will occur in heavy rainfall events (ibid). Projected increases in sea level will put pressure on 
coastal areas, especially in the southern region and in Cape Verde. Senegal's 700 km coastline is already 
retreating at a rate of 1-2 meters every year due to sea-level rise and increased intensity of storms and 
waves. If the sea level rises by one meter by 2100, between 55 and 85 km 2 of beaches would disappear 
and around 6 000 km 2 of low-lying areas would be exposed to coastal flooding, notably the estuaries 
(GFDRR, 2011). A projected increase in coastal urbanisation (+15% over 2005-2030) could worsen this 
situation, with 75% of Senegal's coastline being at high risk of erosion by 2080 (Egis Eau, 2013). Development co-operation providers have supported several climate vulnerability studies of Senegal. 
Studies have focused on coastal areas (World Bank, 2013), food security (Funk et al., 2012) and eastern 
Senegal (USAID, 2014). These found that low-input rain fed agriculture will be hit hardest by climate 
change, with yields in the 2080s decreasing by nearly 50% for sorghum and millet. The yield of high-input 
rain fed agriculture will decrease more moderately, between 2-3% in the 2020s up to 15-40% in the 2080s 
depending on the type of crop (GFDRR, 2011). The impact of climate change on cattle is missing from 
many studies, despite its importance for the animal sector (IFPRI, 2014). Rising sea levels may also 
increase saline intrusion of groundwater basins and affect the quality of water supplies (IED 
Afrique, 2015). Insufficient mapping of current and projected risks, particularly regarding flooding and coastal 
erosion is an obstacle to disaster risk and adaptation planning. The environment ministry has announced its 
intention to address this issue following the destruction of 200 houses by coastal storms around Dakar in 
2015. The ministry will host the Observation Mission of the West African Coastline within its Ecological 
Monitoring Centre (CSE). The observatory is supported by the International Union for Conservation of 
Nature and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and will involve eleven of the Union's 
member countries. The scope of the mission has yet to be defined, but the Global Fund for Disaster Risk 
Reduction has identified a number of areas where further analysis would be valuable: higher-resolution 
segmentation of the coastline, including improved elevation and sea-level measurements, coastal 
geomorphology and understanding of sediment loads (GFDRR, 2011). The data and research gathered by 
this institution would complement the existing sources of climate information in Senegal: the National 11 The isohyet is an imaginary line that connects points on a map with equal rainfall at a certain time or for a certain 
period. ENV/WKP(2017)7 33 Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology (ANACIM), and the CSE. Both of these institutes currently 
focus on agrometeorological information, monitoring rainfall, vegetation cover, wildfires, hydrological and 
agricultural data, using satellite imagery and field observations. Data on the impacts of natural catastrophes are not routinely collected by the Senegalese 
administration, but are instead estimated through ad-hoc projects funded by development providers. For 
example, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) assessed the human and 
economic impact of the 2009 urban floods. This lack of systematic collection makes it more difficult to 
qualify the economic attractiveness of alternatives to the  " business as usual "  management of disaster risk. Institutional and policy framework Senegal's management of climate-related risks is covered by three ministries. The environment 
ministry is in charge of planning for climate adaptation and accessing international climate funds through 
the accredited Ecological Monitoring Centre, the interior ministry is responsible for disaster risk 
management and the finance ministry coordinates the country's participation in insurance mechanisms at 
the national and local level. Sectoral adaptation policies are also implemented by the relevant ministries, 
such as the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Equipment, Fisheries, Livestock and Farming, or dedicated 
agencies such as the National Council for Food Security and the Commission for Food Security (CSA). The institutional structure at the national level contains several advisory bodies, but their respective 
mandates and roles are not always clearly defined. The field of risk and disaster management, for instance, 
formally has four advisory bodies established under the authority of the prime minister or interior ministry: 
the High Commission of Civil Protection, the National Platform for Reduction of Major Disaster Risks, a 
National Unit for Flood Prevention and a National Committee on Flood Prevention, Supervision and 
Monitoring (Political Champions Group, 2013; GFDRR, 2014). Despite the creation of coordinating 
groups such as the National Committee for Climate Adaptation or the Research, Planning and Monitoring 
Committee, the different policy areas operate largely in isolation from one another, with different 
governance and funding frameworks. The creation of a presidential council to tackle the impacts of floods 
in 2012 added an additional layer of complexity to the management of disaster risk (Government of 
Senegal, 2013). Adaptation and disaster risk management are integrated into economic development planning, 
including dedicated objectives in Senegal's medium-term strategic plan for development and its 
accompanying Priority Action Plan, adopted in 2012. The Plan for an Emerging Senegal (PSE), aims to 
shift the country from a developing economy to an emerging one by 2035, while the Priority Action Plan 
for 2014-2018 provides an implementation framework for 190 urgent measures, which were selected from 
the 451 identified in the PSE. 12 Objectives for catastrophe prevention and climate resilience activities 
include: developing national and regional contingency plans, establishing an early warning system on 
natural hazards, as well as an insurance mechanism and an emergency intervention fund. However, the 
implementation of these activities is delayed due to insufficient funding being available. Policy framework for climate change adaptation The main planning document for adaptation is Senegal's National Adaptation Programme of Action 
(NAPA), which was published in 2006. It provided the first comprehensive analysis of the country's 
vulnerabilities to climate change and defined short-term priorities for adaptation, namely coastal zones, 
water infrastructure and agriculture. It prioritises adaptation measures by taking into account their 12 Under the optimistic scenario, 59% of the PSE is financed through contributions from the state, development 
partners and the private sector, while 31% of the PSE Priority Action Plan costs are in a funding gap. ENV/WKP(2017)7 34 contribution to poverty reduction, cost-efficiency and potential contribution to other international 
conventions. However, implementation remains a challenge with only 1 of the 14 priority adaptation projects 
currently being implemented. The NAPA includes a comprehensive process for monitoring and evaluation, 
but there is no public record of this having been implemented. A National Adaptation Plan (NAP) is currently under preparation. The NAP process was established 
under the Cancun Adaptation Framework of the UNFCCC. NAPs are a mean of identifying medium-and 
long-term adaptation needs and developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those 
needs. One of the key features of this process in Senegal is that it involves the stakeholders contributing to 
implementation, such as development co-operation providers, from the outset. The NAP will consist of a 
series of strategic sectoral plans for long-term adaptation, which is intended to ensure coordinated multi-
sectoral approaches. Development co-operation providers are supporting the development of Senegal's 
NAP. For instance, USAID has been assisting with the elaboration of the sectoral NAP for fisheries 
since 2014. The Directorate of Environment and Classified Establishments has been supported since 2011 by the 
National Committee for Climate Adaptation, a cross-ministerial consultative institution designed to raise 
awareness about climate adaptation. Regional Adaptation Committees were created in 2012 with support 
from UNDP to fulfil this role at the local level, in alignment with the government's desire to increase local 
ownership of environmental issues. Communities acquired a major role in the implementation of 
environmental policies and natural resource management, aided by the administrative reorganisation of 
local communities according to eco-geographical zones in the 2014 Third Decentralisation Act 
(MEDD, 2016). In practice, however, local democratically elected bodies, including rural councils and 
water user associations, are dominated in many communities by rural hierarchies based on family lineage, 
religion, and political party membership (USAID, 2010). Policy framework for disaster risk management and integration with climate adaptation The Senegalese government does not yet have a comprehensive strategy for disaster risk management, 
and there is therefore little integration with national climate adaptation policies. A range of actors 
implement activities to prevent natural catastrophes or reduce their negative social and economic impact. 
The occurrence of natural disasters tends to result in the creation of new institutions or coordinating 
groups, rather than reforms to existing ones (Government of Senegal, 2013). There is an increasing focus 
on risk prevention, as opposed to emergency measures, evidenced by the adoption of the Ten-Year Flood 
Management Plan in 2012 (GFDRR, 2014). The Civil Protection Department is the main authority responsible for risk prevention and the 
protection of civilians, goods and the environment. The department's role is to coordinate protection 
activities with the fire brigade and other ministries. This includes collaboration with the Ministry of 
Urbanism and Land-Use Planning, which is in charge of implementing risk reduction projects. On flood 
management, the department shares the responsibility with the Ministry of Reconstruction and Planning of 
Floodable Areas, which was created to administer the USD 1.4 billion Ten-Year Flood Management 
Program (PDGI) over 2012-2022. The Department also coordinates the two early warning systems in place 
for food security and river levels: the National Committee for Food Security is responsible for the former 
and the Directorate of Forward-looking Management of Water Resources for the latter. Renewed plans to streamline disaster risk reduction activities are expected to result in the creation of 
a National Agency for Civil Protection 13 . This would replace the National Platform for Catastrophe Risk 13 www.interieur.gouv.sn/le-ministere/programmes-et-projets/projet-de-gestion-des-risques-et-catastrophes-et-
dadaptation-au-changement-climatique-grc-acc/. ENV/WKP(2017)7 35 Reduction, which is established in the interior ministry in 2008. The Platform was intended to be the 
anchoring institution for the application of the Hyogo Convention (Government of Senegal, 2008), but it 
has never been active.. The National Agency is planned to include an Operational Centre for Inter-
ministerial Crisis Management, with a centralised database covering all of Senegal's risks, a multi-risk 
monitoring and early warning system. This will use data from the Ecological Monitoring Centre (including 
flooding, bush fires and coastal flooding risks), and a geographical information system (GIS). The planned 
creation of a national school of Civil Protection should further contribute to Senegal's capacity for disaster 
risk reduction. Progress has, however, been slow and much more is needed to develop capacity and shift to 
a more preventive approach, instead of the traditional focus on emergency relief. Finance for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management Senegal has received support from a variety of development co-operation providers to invest in 
activities to manage climate risks. This has resulted in many stand-alone projects that face challenges in 
ensuring their sustainability and achieving scale. Insufficient donor coordination has also resulted in 
duplication of efforts and gaps in implementation. The section provides estimates of public international and domestic finance targeting the management 
of climate risks. It is based on available data from the OECD DAC CRS, which captures bilateral and 
multilateral development finance, and existing sources of information on national investment as available. 
The aim of this section is to provide an overview of how the financing of these activities is tracked and 
how this has changed between 2010 and 2014. At the national level, Senegal uses the triennial Public Investment Programs for budget planning, with 
the current programme covering the 2014-2016 period. The development plan (PSE) also includes budget 
estimates for activities to prevent natural disasters and combat climate change. The country has 
traditionally focused resources on emergency relief and rehabilitation after disasters, rather than 
prevention. This is slowly changing, as shown by the inclusion of objectives on adaptation and disaster risk 
management in the PSE and the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). Senegal's INDC estimates that USD 14.5 billion will be required for the implementation of adaptation 
policies (Table 4) (Government of Senegal, 2015). The INDC identifies flooding, livestock farming, 
fisheries and biodiversity as priority areas, and presents cost estimates for the implantation of adaptation 
measures in each sector to 2035. Approximately one-eighth of the total cost is expected to be covered by 
national funding (USD 1.8 billion), with the remainder coming from external sources, such as development 
partners. The National Climate Fund was created in 2015 to scale-up domestic resources and channel external 
ones to climate projects. This fund is based within the environment ministry. The Ministry of Economics, 
Finance and Planning and the CSE participate in the administration of the Fund (DCF, 2015; République 
du Sénégal and UNDP, n.d). The fund is designed to take advantage of possible international partnerships 
and funding agreements created by the Green Climate Fund. It also aims at improving the efficiency of 
international aid in environmental programmes. The National Climate Fund raises around USD 60 million 
per year (DCF, 2015). ENV/WKP(2017)7 36 Table 4. Cost of adaptation actions in Senegal 2016-2035 (million USD) Sectors

14,558 Source: Senegal INDC (2015). International financial resources for adaptation and disaster risk management Development co-operation providers are supporting both adaptation and disaster risk management 
efforts in Senegal. This section uses data on resource flows to provide an overview of trends in these policy 
areas. There is no specific marker for the broader management of climate risks, beyond the one for 
adaptation-related activities. It is possible to identify expenditure in some relevant sectors, but this does not 
capture all potentially relevant activities. The most relevant of these sectors are: disaster prevention and 
preparedness, flood prevention/control and reconstruction, relief and rehabilitation. These are referred to 
as the  " key sectors " . Emergency response activities have not been included in the analysis as they were 
considered to be less relevant to building resilience against climate risks. A significant proportion of the ODA to Senegal targets climate change adaptation objectives 
(Figure 6). The amounts have been relatively stable between 2010 and 2013, but 2014 marked a record 
year, with adaptation-related ODA reaching USD 100 million 14 , or 12% of the total bilateral ODA (up 
from 5% in 2010). The total resources add up to USD 357 million over the five-year period analysed. 14 All Figures in this report are in 2013 constant USD. ENV/WKP(2017)7 37 Figure 6.

Multilateral agencies reporting to the CRS using the climate-component approach identified almost 
USD 117 million between 2010 and 2014 for adaptation-related activities in Senegal (Figure 7). Figure 7. Multilateral adaptation-related flows (2010-2014) Source: OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System. In Senegal, approximately USD 11 million from bilateral donors was targeted towards adaptation

search identified USD 46 million in resources, compared to the USD 15 million captured in the key 
sectors. The largest providers of adaptation-related flows to the key sectors have been the Islamic 
Development Bank (USD 11 million) and the Nordic Development Fund (USD 3.8 million). This confirms 
that some relevant projects are not in the key sectors and might be lost in the analysis if not checked on an 
activity level basis. More broadly, there is a need for further research as many of the projects financing 
resilience might be under-reported, due to their cross-cutting nature. A useful feature of donor support in Senegal is the active community of development partners 
meeting regularly around common areas of interest, within the framework of the Partnership of Technical 
and Financial partners in Senegal (http://ptfsenegal.org/). This partnership aims to improve coherence 
between projects and to contribute to the complementarity of activities, as shown by several joint projects, 
such as the USAID/WFP/OXFAM engagement. Canada and USAID intend to work together to expand the 
Naatal Mbay insurance scheme in the country. Use of domestic resources for disaster risk management and adaptation measures at the national and 
subnational level Senegal does not have a national tracking system for climate change adaptation and/or disaster risk 
management expenditures. However, there are several planning documents and activity reports that 
provide relevant information on this topic. The PSE estimates the financing gap for disaster risk and 
climate resilience projects to be USD 67 million, of which around half (USD 28 million) is anticipated to 
be met from external contributions. 15 Senegal's Hyogo Framework for Action Assessment Report (Government of Senegal, 2015b) 
estimated that USD 164 million per year was allocated to hazard-proofing sectoral investments (e.g. 
transport, agriculture, and infrastructure). The majority of activities targeted at disaster risk reduction and 
prevention are not systematically accounted for in the national budget. Instead, they are financed using a 
series of contingent mechanisms, funds and donor financing. The Hyogo report highlights an exception: 
the Ministry of Reconstruction and Planning of Floodable Areas has successfully executed the emergency 
phase (2013) of the ten-year plan to fight against floods with an estimated budget of USD 135 000. The 
government activated the National Relief Organisation Plan (ORSEC) following the 2009 floods, which 
has also brought in funds from other donors including USD 4 million from the World Bank 
(GFDRR, 2014). The government's budget provisions for disaster risk management includes both direct funding to the 
Directorate of Civil Protection through the interior ministry's budget and the use of special funds, 
including (Republique du Senegal, 2012; World Bank & GFDRR, 2012):  The National Solidarity Fund, under the General Delegation for Social Protection and National 
Solidarity.  The Special Fund for Fighting against Flooding, under the Ministry of Water and Sanitation.  The Guarantee Fund for Agricultural Projects.  The Calamity Fund for Agricultural Projects. 15 Exchange rate as of July 2016. ENV/WKP(2017)7 39 However, these funds are not specifically targeted at disaster-related expenditure and tend to be 
insufficient to cover the costs of a catastrophe. Often, the assistance needed after an extreme event are 
larger than expected and there is a need to reallocate budget that has been assigned to other purposes, such 
as prevention. The cost-effectiveness of setting aside ex-ante budget allocations for disaster risk 
management is dependent on the countries needs and the projected impacts of disasters. Analysis by the 
World Bank & GFDRR (2012) suggests that the procedure to access these funds is not fully transparent. Financial protection instruments being used in Senegal There is a growing range of tools to cover the financial impacts of droughts at the national and 
household level in Senegal. These have developed largely as independent initiatives, rather than as part of 
a comprehensive strategy on financial protection. Other climate hazards, particularly flooding, have 
received less attention to date, although existing mechanisms are looking to expand their hazard coverage.

following sections. Table 5. Spectrum of financial protection measures in Senegal Financial protection

-The coverage of these different instruments is increasing steadily, but they still only meet the needs of 
a relatively small part of the population. Reaching the populations most vulnerable to climate impacts, 
including the 60% of people reliant upon rain fed agriculture for subsistence, will be one of the key 
challenges for the future development of these tools. Better coordination between existing initiatives, and 
more resources could play an important part in increasing coverage. The creation of a national certified 
registry could assist with targeting and coordinating beneficiaries of agricultural insurance and social 
protection, and facilitating faster disbursement of funds. ENV/WKP(2017)7 40 Sovereign level The African Risk Capacity (ARC) facility is the primary risk transfer instrument used by Senegal. The 
ARC is a Specialised Agency of the African Union providing parametric weather insurance coverage to 
African governments. Senegal joined ARC in 2012 under the supervision of the Directorate for Civil 
Protection. The payment of a USD 3.1-3.6 million yearly premium makes Senegal eligible for a payout of 
up to USD 30 million for emergency relief if the policy is triggered (Republic of Senegal, 2013). The 
current policy covers the risk of drought, but ARC is planning and designing the Extreme Climate Facility 
to include other natural hazards such as flooding. Development co-operation providers played an important 
part in Senegal's participation to ARC, with JICA paying for the first year's premium as the government's 
annual budget was already fully allocated. The government's commitment was increased when this first 
premium secured a USD 16.5 million payout following the 2014 drought, two-thirds of which were to be 
used for in-kind food distribution and the rest to subsidise livestock feed. The implementation of relief 
activities is under the responsibility of the CSA. ARC aims to minimise the time of response to a drought: payouts are meant to be spent by 
governments in the first 120 days following a disaster to capitalise on the advantages of early intervention. 
An ARC cost-benefit analysis estimated that the economic benefits of getting aid to households in the 
critical three months after harvest could result in benefits of nearly USD 1 300 per household assisted in 
terms of protected economic gains (Republic of Senegal, 2013). These benefits include the protection of 
nutritional intake and avoiding the need to sell productive assets. ARC also mandates the preparation of an Implementation Plan prior to the disbursement of the 
payout. This preparation allowed Senegal to adjust its resource allocation mechanism to benefit the most 
vulnerable populations. An independent review of the Final Implementation Plan commissioned by ARC 
(Kimetrica, 2014) identified a lack of clarity on how many livestock owners would be targeted by the 
livestock feed subsidy and the risk that this subsidy would only be available to relatively wealthy farmers 
owning more than ten cattle. Subsequently, Senegal changed the monitoring of the revolving fund 
receiving revenue from feed sales as well as the requirements relating to the number of cattle (DfID, 2015). However, prior to disbursing the payout, both ARC and an independent review of the final 
contingency plans expressed concerns regarding the lack of clarity regarding the targeting of payouts and 
whether those that were most affected by the droughts would receive support (DfID, 2015). In the case of 
food distribution, for example, the plan details the number of projected beneficiaries per department of 
intervention (between 4 000 and 70 000), and mentions that beneficiaries will be selected using  " targeting 
criteria " , without detailing precisely what those may look like. Distribution of food is projected to involve 
many actors: it is led by the Executive Secretariat of the National Food Security Council, which will 
establish a national food and distribution supervisory committee and several regional and departmental 
technical committees. These will work in collaboration with decentralized administrative authorities 
(governors, prefects and sub-prefects) and Food Security Monitoring and Livelihoods Agents. Village or 
neighbourhood assemblies will help to identify the most vulnerable households. The CSA is responsible 
for acquiring and delivering food at the localities (ARC, 2014). The first payout under ARC in Senegal, following the 2014 drought, revealed implementation 
challenges. Underestimation of the logistical difficulties in distributing food to those affected by drought, 
and the complicated process for disbursing the payout within the country have both been cited as the main 
causes of this delay. Senegal is among the first countries participating to ARC to receive a payout, and has 
received the largest compensation by far. 16 These challenges provide an opportunity for other ARC 
member states to learn from the country's experience. For instance, ARC currently gives the compensation 16 In 2015, ARC paid out USD 16.5 million to Senegal, USD 6.3 million to Mauritania and USD 3.5 million to Niger. ENV/WKP(2017)7 41 payout to the finance ministry in Senegal, following previously agreed arrangements. But officials within 
the Insurance Department and ARC noted the ministry's budgetary processes were not well suited to 
meeting the demands of rapid disaster relief. For this reason, the finance ministry considering accrediting 
an alternative institution to receive ARC payouts and speed-up its use, as was done by Mauritania with a 
commercial bank. According to the Finance Ministry, the current maximum amount for payouts, capped at 
USD 30 million, is insufficient to cover Senegal's needs. The Ministry estimated the costs of the 2014 
drought at USD 57 million, which was almost double the payout. To further increase the reach of ARC, 
development co-operation providers could support Senegal to subscribe to a second insurance policy and 
better insure its potential losses, as has been done with Kenya. ARC is also encouraging UN agencies and 
NGOs to participate in its new Replica Fund and match country policies to double their coverage in case of 
crisis. Participating in the Replica Fund might be another opportunity for development co-operation 
providers to support the scaling-up of ARC. Private sector Private sector property insurance consists mostly of flood cover for commercial and industrial assets 
(World Bank & GFDRR, 2012; Political Champions Group, 2013). However, the penetration of this 
product in the market is very low, mainly for two reasons: the lack of general insurance market 
development and weak property rights, particularly in rural areas where customary law continues to prevail 
(USAID, 2010). The exact percentage of registered privately owned land is unknown, but rates of land 
ownership are estimated to be growing albeit from a low base (Durand-Lasserve and Ndiaye 2008; 
Monkam 2009). Household level Financial protection at the household level has focused on the agricultural sector. One of the 
underlying issues is the lack of land-use planning and insufficiency of property rights. In 1987, the 
government adopted a policy of systematic regularization of informal settlements and planned to provide 
upgradeable, 50-year rights of occupancy to 41 000 households. But this policy lacked the financial and 
human resources support necessary for implementation, and only about 1 600 plots had been regularized 
under the program as of 2007 (ibid). Flood micro-insurance in urban areas, especially Dakar, linked with 
credit, could represent a viable alternative and improve coverage of low-income households (Political 
Champions Group, 2013), providing compliance and enforcement of the existing land-use planning 
regulations can be successfully addressed. Another underlying challenge is that access to finance in Senegal remains very limited. Products such 
as credit, saving opportunities, transaction facilities and insurance do not reach a large part of the 
population (PRISE, 2015). Only 43% of the population has access to credit, and only 0.24% uses mobile 
banking to pay bills (PRISE, 2015). This lack of access to financial markets increases considerably the risk 
of low-income populations falling into poverty traps, in particular after a weather-related disaster. 
Therefore, better access to finance, as a way to cope with greater risk and to escape poverty, could be an 
important instrument for adapting to climate change. This is an area where further research is needed to 
ensure access to finance meets the needs of the most vulnerable populations. Most of the ex-ante mechanisms 17 for financial protection of households focus on the agricultural 
sector, given the sector's vulnerability to drought and the large proportion of the population relying on it 
for subsistence. The first mechanism put in place in the late 1990s, the Calamity Fund, provided disaster 17 For more the ex-post use of national budget for emergency situations, see section 3.2. ENV/WKP(2017)7 42 relief to borrowing farmers primarily by waiving loans from the National Bank for Agricultural Credit 
(CNCAS). Together with the Guarantee Fund 18 and the Bonus Fund 19 , the Calamity Fund received 
USD 99 million from the government between 1998 and 2005 (Political Champions Group, 2013). 
Between 2005 and 2012, the funds were budgeted but never disbursed, until 2013 when an extra 
USD 6 million was allocated to them. However, these funds have been criticised for the lack of 
transparency in the allocation and the delays in implementation (WB/GFDRR/DFID, 2013). The 
government is instead relying increasingly on insurance mechanisms for the agricultural sector. The Ministry of Finance has been considering the development of agricultural insurance since 1996, 
culminating in the creation of the National Agricultural Insurance Company (CNAAS) in 2008, a Public 
Private Partnership underwriting crop and livestock insurance, both traditional and index-based. The 
CNAAS is 50% owned by private insurance companies, 37.5% by the government, and the remainder by 
farmers' organisations. Since it does not require a verified auditor to assess the insurance claim but only 
weather stations recordings, index-insurance should have lower transaction costs. The CNAAS focusses on index insurance for small farmers, for which the Government provides a 
50% premium subsidy, and has about 20 000 policyholders. This number includes small neighbouring 
farmers united through Groups of Economic Interest, who pool their assets to reach the critical size for 
subscribing to insurance. While this represents an impressive increase from the 1 285 policies sold in its 
first year of operation (2011), the CNAAS' coverage is still minimal at the national level. Development co-operation providers are boosting the CNAAS's coverage by funding regional pilot 
projects such as Feed the Future Senegal's Naatal Mbay (USAID) and R4 (World Food 
Programme/Oxfam) which target the most vulnerable farmers and encourage them to insure themselves 
through Groups of Economic Interest. They are also indirectly supporting the expansion of this type of 
micro-insurance programme to new areas through their investment in weather stations. The World Bank 
has also supported the regional insurance industry body, the Conference of Inter-American Insurance 
Markets to provide a legal and regulatory framework for micro-insurance and agricultural index-based 
insurance (CIMA Book 7). The uptake of adaptive practices at the household level, and the degree of confidence in insurance 
mechanisms, relies upon the development of reliable climate information services tailored to farmers, 
herders and fishermen's needs. USAID and the World Meteorological Organisation's Global Framework 
for Climate Services (GFCS) are partnering in Senegal to fund the dissemination of climate predictive 
information for risk management. GFCS also supported ANACIM to develop a National Action Plan on 
Climate Services outlining their needs in terms of equipment and capacity building to better coordinate 
financial and in-kind support from donors. Reliable climate information services benefit the development 
of programmes for resilient livelihoods. These include USAID's Feed the Future projects, the Consultative 
Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research programme on Climate Change, 
Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and the R4 rural initiative (Box 4). CNAAS suggests its index micro-insurance products could increase their coverage if banking 
institutions required their loan customers to buy insurance, as opposed to only recommending it as they do 
today. The institution also cites the high cost for low-income farmers (despite the subsidy), the negative 
perception of insurance and the logistical costs of creating rural networks for product distribution as 
limiting its development (World Bank & GFDRR, 2012). The development of individual index insurance 18 The Guarantee Fund reduces lending risk by compensating the CNCAS for up to 75% of agriculture (50% of 
livestock) loan default. 19 The Bonus Fund subsidizes lending rates by compensating CNCAS for the difference between market rate and the 
mandated 7.5% charged to borrowers. ENV/WKP(2017)7 43 is also strongly limited by the lack of weather stations infrastructure. Another area for development is to 
increase the coordination with the pan-African Risk Capacity providing index-based agricultural insurance 
at the sovereign level. Box 4. R4 Rural Initiative in Senegal The R4 Rural Initiative was initiated in 2011 by the UN World Food Programme and Oxfam America, initially with 
Senegal and Ethiopia. Building on the Horn of Africa Risk Transfer for Adaptation (HARITA) Initiative, started in 2009 
by Oxfam America in Ethiopia, R4 aims to improve the resilience of vulnerable households living in rural areas against 
climate volatility and weather-related catastrophes. This programme integrates four risk management strategies:  Improved resource management through asset creation (risk reduction): Assets built through risk reduction activities promote resilience by steadily decreasing vulnerability to disaster risks over time.  Insurance (risk transfer): Farmers can access agricultural index-based insurance by paying with their labour through Insurance-for-Assets (IfA) schemes. When a drought hits, compensation for weather-related losses 
reduces the need for farmers to sell productive assets and stimulates faster recovery.  Livelihoods diversification and microcredit (prudent risk taking): Insurance facilitates access to credit at better rates by serving as collateral. Households can invest in riskier but more remunerative enterprises, as 
well as in seeds, fertilizers and new technologies to increase their agricultural productivity.  Savings (risk reserves): Participants establish small-scale savings, which are used to build 'risk reserves'. Savings help build a stronger financial base for investing – but also act as a buffer against short-term needs 
and idiosyncratic shocks, such as illness and death. To ensure long-term sustainability, R4 contributes to the creation of rural financial markets, by building local 
capacity and gradually transitioning farmers to pay for insurance in cash. In 2015, more than 3 500 farmers were 
covered by insurance, out of which more than 3 000 received a total payout of USD 81 000, as a result of the major dry 
spells recorded at the beginning of the rainy season. Subscriptions to R4's insurance product represent more than half of the CNASS' index insurance portfolio. Source: WFP & Oxfam America (2014). Beyond agricultural micro-insurance, USAID is pioneering a micro-insurance scheme for fishers 
through its programme Collaborative Management for a Sustainable Fisheries Future in Senegal 
(COMFISH). Currently in its test phase, the scheme enrols fishers to volunteer in a collaborative 
surveillance programme through Local Councils for Artisanal Fisheries, as a means to both fight illegal 
fishing and protect lives and assets through mobile-phone-based early warning systems. This pilot also 
offers insurance coverage for each of the fishers' outings at sea which, like the agricultural projects 
previously described, operates in partnership with the CNAAS and ANACIM. At the national level, the development by the Directorate of Social Protection of a unified registry of 
poor and vulnerable households (known as the RNU) provides an opportunity to streamline the agricultural 
insurance and social protection systems. The registry compiles information about beneficiaries of all social 
programs under one system, and has been extended to support the next round of cash transfer program of 
the National Family Security Grant. The government plans to use this registry to channel ARC payouts to 
beneficiaries, which could greatly increase their transparency. ENV/WKP(2017)7 44 6. 
Lessons learnt and conclusions: key enablers of action and implications for development co-
operation providers The two case studies present two contrasting experiences in climate-resilient disaster risk 
management: Colombia, an upper middle income country, has long experience of vulnerability to climate-
related natural hazards, compounded by long-running internal conflict. Senegal, a low income country, 
suffers the consequences from both urban floods and severe droughts that hinder the security of its urban 
population and have dramatic economic consequences for rural population and the agricultural production, 
a key economic sector. Support from donors has made a substantial contribution to Colombia's and Senegal's efforts to 
strengthen the management of climate-related disasters. In particular, financial and technical expertise has 
facilitated the development of instruments to share, transfer and finance disaster risk. In both case studies, 
the main instruments focused on the management of risks at the sovereign level, while tools to target the 
most vulnerable households have not yet achieved widespread coverage. The use of financial protection tools to manage exposure to climate risks requires strong co-ordination 
across relevant sectors, and at different levels of governance. Raising awareness both at the government 
level and among the population is a prerequisite for scaling-up interventions. This needs to be 
accompanied with the development of sufficient technical capacity and data for evidence-based decision-
making. Yet, major gaps remain at present, both in Colombia and Senegal. Addressing these gaps will 
require concerted efforts to strengthen capacity, in particular through improved data availability and 
analysis, strong leadership and clear allocation of responsibilities. Reliable data are needed for effective management of climate risks Reliable, detailed data are important for adaptation and financial protection, but there are significant 
gaps in coverage in both case study countries. In particular, historical data on past losses from extreme 
events is incomplete. This makes it difficult to target efforts to manage risks, as well as model the potential 
scale of losses from future events. Under-recording of disaster losses is not confined to the two case study 
countries. Globally, disaster losses are estimated to be at least 50% higher than reported figures 
(UNISDR, 2013). In general, high impact, low frequency events are better recorded than low impact, high 
frequency events. Although both countries have specialised agencies working to provide accurate climate 
data, better coverage of climate and weather data remains essential to support risk management. Investment in improved data collection and analysis is important for the management of current 
climate variability, but it can also make an important long-term contribution to climate change adaptation. 
Colombia has varied microclimates, but the coverage of weather stations is uneven. The lack of climate 
data for some of these microclimates makes it difficult to understand past trends, generate weather 
forecasts and project the impacts of climate change. The coverage of the Amazonian region is limited, but 
the government is taking steps to improve data collection, including through investment from the 
Colombian Adaptation Fund. This will over time provide valuable input to the development of index-based 
insurance and early warning systems. It takes several decades of historical data to understand local weather 
patterns. The value of translating data into usable information is demonstrated by early warning systems, which 
are an essential, cost-effective component of integrated approaches to the management of the risks from 
climate change. Early warning systems are effective in reducing the mortality rate from extreme events, 
and also have the potential to reduce asset losses (Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). Bilateral donors are 
supporting the uptake of these measures through initiatives such as the Climate Risk Early Warning 
Systems Program (CREWS), which aims to support up to 80 countries in developing early warning ENV/WKP(2017)7 45 systems. This is supported by a number of countries, including: Canada, France, Luxembourg and 
Australia. Better data on countries' economic vulnerability to climate-related disasters can help identify what 
measures are required for different sectors, regions and segments of the population. Efforts to strengthen 
data collection are part of a package accompanying Colombia's USD 250 million contingent credit from 
the World Bank. Historical data are being reconstructed using different sources of information such as 
newspaper archives to better understand the history of damages and costs. This was essential in informing 
the Colombian government on the applicability of tools for managing the consequences of future climate 
events. There are also efforts to strengthen the recording of current disaster losses, which will reduce the 
need to reconstruct missing data in the future. Senegal is bringing together data from a number of different sources to create a centralised multi-risk 
database, including data on inland flooding, wild fires and coastal flood risk. Existing information is 
limited to weather data and climate projections, which were produced with the support of development 
providers. The recording of financial losses is restricted to assessments undertaken following large events 
such as the 2009 floods in Dakar. Losses from smaller, but more frequent events are not systematically 
recorded. Improved data on vulnerable populations can also assist with the management of climate risks. In 
Senegal, the creation of a national registry of social protection beneficiaries helps to target and pay social 
protection. The registry has facilitated the development of mobile payments for social protection, with 
approximately 30 000 households now receiving cash transfers from the government via their mobile 
phones. Strengthening capacity and building leadership at national and subnational levels Strong capacity is required to understand and manage the risks posed by climate change. Given the 
cross-cutting nature of climate change, one key aspect is the institutional co-ordination between the 
relevant policy areas, and the allocation of responsibilities across the government agencies at the national 
and subnational level. Traditionally, responsibility for designing and implementing climate change 
adaptation policies lies with the ministry of environment, while the responsibility regarding disaster risk 
management and financial protection is spread across several agencies (finance ministry, agency for civil 
protection, among others). As a result, the financial protection, disaster risk management and climate 
change community often operate in different silos, governed by different agencies, budgets and timelines. 
Stronger co-ordination among stakeholders has the potential to avoid duplication of efforts, improve the 
targeting of scarce resources and fill knowledge gaps. In Colombia, the leadership of the finance ministry's risk management unit has been essential for the 
development of the financial protection strategy. The financial strategy, developed with strong support 
from the World Bank and the Swiss Development Co-operation agency, has resulted in the signing of a 
credit line with a catastrophe drawdown option (Cat DDO), a planned risk pooling facility with Pacific 
Alliance Countries and mandatory insurance for road concessions. The finance ministry is a strong actor 
and can ensure co-ordination within the sectoral ministries as well as with subnational governments 
(OECD, 2015; GFDRR, 2014). At the subnational level, capacity is often limited due to reduced budgets and limited staff numbers. In 
Colombia, the majority of resources flowing to disaster risk management are channelled at the subnational 
level, but the availability of ex-ante funding and budget allocations are limited. As a result, subnational 
governments are often forced to reallocate funds for emergencies form other sources, or to obtain 
humanitarian aid from the national government and external partners in case of a large disaster. The city of ENV/WKP(2017)7 46 Bogota has emerged as a leader in the management of disaster risks, recognising the burden that disasters 
pose in its finances and the well-being of the large urban population. Since 2012, it has integrated climate 
change adaptation and disaster risk management into the same institute. Bogota has also created a 
dedicated fund to finance knowledge, prevention and management activities as part of the Strategic Plan 
for Disaster Risk Management and also the Climate Change Plan. The city invested resources with support 
from the World Bank to develop studies that helped to identify high-risk areas and prioritise key actions to 
reduce vulnerability, and consequently developed a portfolio of financial protection options. In Senegal, donors including Japan, the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Risk 
Reduction (GFDRR) have been active in supporting national level efforts to manage disaster risks. They 
are jointly supporting the strengthening of the Civil Protection Agency and the improvement of the 
Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction Civil Protection Agency. However, the implementation of these plans 
is still facing challenges, due in part to capacity constraints. The participation of actors from the adaptation 
community in the platform would be beneficial for streamlining knowledge on climate impacts and 
improving integration at the sectoral level. Urban areas in Senegal, including Dakar and Kaolack, are vulnerable to recurring floods exacerbated 
by unplanned development. The Municipal Development Agency is taking the lead in improving the 
management of urban floods. The Agency embarked in an ambitious project to improve the management of 
storm water and adapt to climate change (PROGEP project). This project included capacity building, 
investment in protective infrastructure, and the engagement of affected communities in risk reduction 
efforts. Donors provided technical and financial support for the post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) after 
the floods in 2009, which resulted in the adoption of the 10-year flood management plan and provided the 
foundation for PROGEP's implementation. However, challenges remain including: inadequate enforcement 
of land use planning legislation; social conflicts linked to resettlement; and negative health impacts caused 
by floods. Maintaining robust and reliable data on floods and having the capacity to interpret them have 
been signalled as areas where support would be welcome. Development co-operation providers can play a vital role in strengthening the capacity of national and 
subnational governments by: (i) supporting the creation or strengthening of data collection and analysis on 
climate risks, vulnerability, economic impacts of disasters and past and projected losses; and (ii) building 
capacity in government ministries and relevant agencies to assess climate-related risks and define a 
suitable financial strategy. Financial protection against climate-related risks: what works, when and for whom? Financial protection tools have different sets of benefits and limitations (Table 6) and the appropriate 
set will depend upon countries' circumstances. In Colombia, the focus of development co-operation efforts 
to date has been on improving the management of risks held by the public sector. In contrast, in Senegal 
providers have focussed particularly on extending coverage to farmers and poor households. The approach 
taken in Senegal is partly due to capacity constraints at the national level, leading providers to choose pilot 
initiatives jointly managed by the government, CSOs, producer organisations and the beneficiary 
communities. ENV/WKP(2017)7 47 Table 6. Benefits and limitations of selected financial protection tools Tool

Payments may not reflect losses Source: Adapted from (G20/OECD, 2012). Financial protection has to be part of a broader disaster risk management package including risk 
assessment and risk reduction. The two case study countries are using financial protection tools as part of a 
comprehensive disaster risk management and adaptation strategy. An emerging lesson is that it is 
particularly important to ensure that the allocation of risks is clearly understood prior to the occurrence of 
an extreme event, thereby helping to allocate responsibilities and budgets to implement a comprehensive 
strategy. The decision on which climate-related risks will be reduced, shared, transferred or retained will 
depend on a careful evaluation of the impacts and the social and economic needs of the country. In Colombia, significant flooding in 2010-2011 catalysed political will and policy reforms to 
strengthen the management of climate-related risks and other natural hazards. In particular, it resulted in 
the development of a financial strategy against natural disasters. Colombia's strategy is focused on 
protecting the sovereign level from the fiscal impact of natural disasters by combining risk reduction with 
financial protection. The government has developed financial protection tools for large, infrequent events ENV/WKP(2017)7 48 via contingent finance from the World Bank. They have also improved data and strengthened insurance of 
public assets. Remaining challenges include the management of low intensity, high frequency events. At 
the household level, the majority of the population relies on the assistance of the Government, including 
humanitarian assistance, to recover from an event. Senegal's government has acceded to the ARC regional sovereign risk insurance facility with support 
from bilateral providers. For participating countries, the Facility provides rapid liquidity in case a drought 
hits, as the funds are disbursed within the first 3 months after the declaration of the emergency. As such, it 
is benefitting from risk transfer mechanisms, transferring part of the risk to the private sector, and pooling 
resources with other countries in a similar situation regarding climate-related risks. ARC also supports risk 
reduction through the provision of technical capacity, and over time is intended to strengthen adaptive 
capacity by keeping development on track in the face of climate variability. Agricultural insurance is a financial protection tool that exists in both Colombia and Senegal, however 
uptake remains low. Underlying causes are (i) limited availability of tailored financial protection tools; 
(ii) transaction costs; and (iii) limited availability of data, making insurance products relatively expensive. The private sector has important roles in relation to financial protection as a source of finance, 
expertise and potential beneficiary. Nonetheless, the development of the private market financial protection 
products in developing countries is still insufficient to tackle the scale of the challenge. Where private 
markets are less developed, like in Senegal, public support and co-ordination with the private sector can 
encourage the expansion of insurance coverage. Proactive support for risk reduction Both Senegal and Colombia have demonstrated the potential for well-designed financial protection 
instruments to strengthen incentives for risk reduction. In Colombia, one of the central tools being used for 
financial protection, the Cat DDO (contingent credit line) inherently provides an incentive for risk 
reduction, as the loan would have to be repaid. Moreover, the implementation of the Cat DDO is bundled 
with a larger set of measures that will proactively reduce risks from climate change. In particular, efforts to 
strengthen capacity at the municipal level should help to reveal where risks are concentrated and provide 
an incentive for those risks to be reduced. Other elements of the financial protection strategy also support 
risk reduction: for example, improving insurance of public assets and PPP infrastructure also serves to 
encourage risk reduction because risk exposure is reflected in insurance premiums. This improves on the 
prior situation where risks were implicitly borne by the government, which reduced concessionaires' 
incentive to engage in risk reduction. There has been less of a link made between financial protection and risk reduction for farmers and 
households in Colombia. Uptake of insurance remains very low: despite premium subsidies of up to 80%, 
only 3% of agricultural land is currently insured. The underlying challenges include lack of awareness and 
the expectation that government compensation will be provided if a disaster occurs. The government 
provides emergency assistance after a disaster hits, but the incentives for prevention and the tools to assist 
the most vulnerable are not yet there. The Colombian Adaptation Fund has shifted from a focus on 
emergency response and reconstruction to an increasing emphasis on prevention, which provides an 
opportunity for communities to build back better and, more generally, to reduce their vulnerability to future 
events. In Senegal, the ARC mechanism inherently provides an incentive for risk reduction, as payments are 
dependent upon the occurrence of a predefined weather threshold being crossed, rather than the actual 
losses incurred. This has been accompanied with measures to support understanding of risk exposure 
through the Africa RiskView programme. The R4 programme provided an integrated set of measures to ENV/WKP(2017)7 49 support risk reduction, as well as providing financial protection against extreme events via index-based 
insurance mechanisms at the household level. The challenge now is to scale up coverage at the household 
level, as only a fraction of the population is currently able to benefit. Social protection can help improve households' adaptive capacity Social protection schemes, and other non-market mechanisms, are vital for reaching the most 
vulnerable populations who are not able to afford insurance coverage. Coverage of insurance for climate 
risks remains low among developing countries and, particularly, vulnerable groups within those countries 
(Surminski, 2015). Technological innovation, and the prospect of achieving economies of scale, may help 
to address this issue, but uptake is likely to remain contingent on the availability of subsidies. As a 
consequence, the expansion of coverage is constrained by the availability of public funding (domestic or 
external). The relative cost-effectiveness of using public funds to subsidise insurance should be compared 
with alternative approaches, given the likely cost and potential for market distortions. In Senegal, the World Bank is working with the government to develop an adaptive social protection 
programme that aims at enhancing the transparency of social protection systems in the country, and 
addressing the critical conditions of families in the face of continuous drought. The programme evolved 
with support from the UK to adjust the existing social protection system so it can be rapidly scaled-up in 
response to regular crises. Poor households have few other options for managing these risks beyond 
resorting to coping mechanisms such as selling assets, using savings and reducing their expenditures. 
Rapid social protection payments have the potential to reduce the need for erosive coping strategies. 
Development co-operation partners can provide their expertise to expand traditional cash transfer 
programmes to take into account climate change impacts and tailor them to build resilience. In Colombia, 
no specific programme exists to improve the resilience of poor households towards climate impacts. Improve co-ordination among development co-operation providers to scale up action Bilateral and multilateral finance flowing to adaptation is growing, and is likely to increase following 
the Paris Agreement. However, finance targeting the management of climate risks related to disasters in 
Colombia and Senegal is relatively low (around 1% of total ODA received, according to analysis of 
OECD DAC CRS data). Colombia has benefitted from a long standing partnership with the World Bank. 
Senegal has received support from both Japan and the World Bank to improve its disaster risk management 
and adaptation links. A key lesson from this has been the importance of sustained and co-ordinated 
engagement on this topic by donors, given the long term need to build awareness, strengthen institutions 
and build capacity In Senegal, a roundtable of donors targeting different sectors has provided a practical 
approach for co-ordinating efforts and finding common objectives to pursue. Collaboration with development co-operation agencies enabled the implementation of innovative 
financial protection mechanisms against disaster risk in both case study countries. The development of 
Colombia's financial protection strategy benefitted from financial support and technical expertise from the 
World Bank and Swiss Development Co-operation. This was designed to facilitate continued engagement 
in the country, thereby helping to ensure longer term impact. In Senegal, the R4 initiative has provided 
farmers with access to insurance, as well as supporting risk reduction practices. Financial support from 
Japan, and the UK enabled Senegal to join the African Risk Capacity. Low rainfall meant that Senegal was 
eligible for a payout in the first year, which prompted the decision to subscribe again the following year 
using domestic funds. ENV/WKP(2017)7 50 Improve support for financial protection in national development and adaptation planning Financial protection tools and adaptation are not yet an integral part of national development or 
adaptation planning in developing countries, with a few exceptions. In Colombia, the leadership of the 
finance ministry in developing the strategy for public management of natural disasters resulted in the 
inclusion of financial protection tools in the country's national development plan. This included efforts to 
reduce fiscal risk to natural disasters by addressing drivers of risk (particularly land use management) and 
protecting the most vulnerable population. The involvement of the World Bank and SDC helped to elevate 
the role of financial protection in the country's political agenda. Financial protection is not yet a major 
component of Colombia's national adaptation strategy, but there is scope for inclusion in the financial 
sector's adaptation plan. The situation is similar in Senegal, with financial protection being integrated with the development 
plan but not with the adaptation plan. The country's NAPA does not directly include financial protection, 
although it does mention the potential for expanding microcredit. This reflects the fact that NAPAs are 
intended to identify priority projects for implementation rather than taking the more strategic role 
envisaged for NAPs. The NAP is currently being developed. However, financial protection is included in 
their economic development strategy and implementation plan. Their Priority Action Plan includes 
measures to improve disaster risk management and strengthen financial protection. Monitoring and evaluation for continuous learning Monitoring and evaluation is essential for managing exposure to climate risks, but it is at an early 
stage in many countries. It is needed for two purposes: firstly, it supports continuous learning, identifying 
effective approaches and helping to identify where changes are needed. Secondly, it helps to ensure that 
resources in support of this agenda are used in a cost-effective manner. OECD (2015b) emphasises that the 
approach used needs to be pragmatic, reflecting data availability and domestic capacity. Colombia and Senegal are developing systems for monitoring and evaluation as part of their national 
adaptation processes. Although neither currently has a system in place, elements of the four tools from 
OECD (2015b) are emerging: risk and vulnerability assessments; indicators to monitor progress; in-depth 
evaluations of significant projects and national audits and expenditure tracking. Both countries have produced vulnerability assessments, but neither of these assessments can be used 
to directly measure progress. Senegal's vulnerability assessment, which was developed to inform its 
NAPA, was a predominantly qualitative analysis, so does not provide a baseline for assessing changes over 
time. However, it could be used to identify vulnerabilities for future monitoring. There are no plans to 
update this national assessment, but more detailed coastal risk assessment will be undertaken through the 
creation of the Observation Mission of the West African Coastline. More recent studies have been 
commissioned by third parties, including USAID (2014) and the World Food Program (2012), but this has 
been on an ad-hoc basis. Colombia is currently finalising an updated, detailed vulnerability assessment. 
This includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analysis. If national vulnerability assessments were 
repeated on a regular basis, and with a consistent methodology, this could support adaptation planning by 
providing indications of how vulnerability is evolving. Indicators for monitoring climate and disaster risk and vulnerabilities can help to monitor progress 
over time, but major data gaps remain. As mentioned above, data on the incidence of climate-related losses 
from extreme events remains sparse, particularly in relation to smaller but more frequent events. 
Improvements in data quality would provide a clearer indication of progress in reducing vulnerability, as 
well as supporting the expansion of financial protection. Besides recorded losses, the data collected to 
monitor progress towards the achievement of the SDGs will also be helpful for assessing trends in ENV/WKP(2017)7 51 underlying drivers of vulnerability, such as poverty and other forms of social disadvantage. Given the 
spatially-specific nature of adaptation, it will be particularly helpful to have geographically-disaggregated 
data. Evaluations of large, or innovative, programmes can support learning about effective adaptation 
approaches. This was illustrated in Colombia by an in-depth evaluation of their system for disaster risk 
management by the World Bank (2012). The lessons gained from this provided the foundation for 
subsequent reforms to address the underlying drivers of vulnerability, such as unplanned development. The 
R4 resilience initiative in Senegal has benefitted directly from the lessons learnt during the development of 
the HARITA programme in Ethiopia. On-going evaluation by WFP and OXFAM (2015) is helping to 
identify progress to date and remaining areas for improvement. Annual progress reports on the African 
Risk Capacity programme have been undertaken by DFID and made available on their website. Proactive 
dissemination of this learning will help to ensure that the lessons from this project can inform other 
programmes. The final tool, expenditure tracking and audits, have demonstrated some interesting results in 
Colombia, but are not being undertaken systematically in either case study country. The Colombian 
national audit institution (Controlaria General) undertook an evaluation of their national adaptation 
programme in 2014, which informed the subsequent development of that programme. Colombia has also 
developed analysis of the  " costs of inaction " , through estimation of its contingent liabilities and analysis of 
the potential costs arising from climate change. This was influential in motivating action to tackle this 
agenda. However, there are currently limited data on the extent to which resources are being invested to 
manage climate-related risks. ENV/WKP(2017)7 52 REFERENCES Agrawala S and Maëlis Carraro (2010),  " Assessing the role of microfinance in fostering adaptation to

development agencies and environment ministries, while also engaging with partner countries and other 
civil society partners, to share experience and promote mutual learning about what constitutes good 
practice. At the international level, following UNFCCC decisions, partner countries are actively preparing 
National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). Partner countries are mobilising resources, building capacity and 
institutional processes to adapt, including at local level. The Task Team supports these efforts by fostering 
exchange and providing policy recommendations to both DAC members and partner countries. Main policy guidance products of the Task Team include:  The OECD Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-
operation (2009) provides overarching general principles that the Task Team has supplemented 
with a range of follow-on activities, including: A practice-oriented training based on the OECD 
Policy Guidance.  An examination of the use of risk screening tools, summarised in the working paper Harmonising 
Climate Risk Management: Adaptation Screening and Assessment Tools for Development 
Co-operation.  The study of monitoring and evaluation in development co-operation practice, which buildings 
on the Task Team's 2011 survey of practice in member countries Monitoring and Evaluation for 
Adaptation: Lessons from Development Co-operation Agencies. A new OECD Working Paper explores methodological approaches to monitor and evaluate climate 
change adaptation initiatives at the project and programme level. It focuses on three M&E challenges of 
relevance for adaptation and examines what lessons can be learned from other areas of development 
practice: i) assessing attribution, ii) establishing baselines and targets, and iii) dealing with long time 
horizons. The most recent output of the Task Team is the publication on National Climate Change Adaptation: 
Emerging Practices in Monitoring and Evaluation. This report examines the approaches used in developing 
and OECD countries to identify emerging lessons. It proposes four tools that countries can use for their 
own assessment frameworks: 1) climate change risk and vulnerability assessments, 2) indicators to monitor 
progress on adaptation priorities, 3) project and programme evaluations to identify effective adaptation 
approaches, and 4) national audits and climate expenditure reviews.
