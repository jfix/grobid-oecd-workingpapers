			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>This report presents the results of a first attempt to create a framework for assessing the performance <lb/>of national family policies. The report is part of a joint EU and OECD project, which aims to help the EU <lb/>Government Expert Group on Demographic Issues in evaluating national family policies. The idea behind <lb/>the framework is that it allows individual countries to compare their overall performance in the area of <lb/>family policies with the performance of other countries. The main focus of the report is policies for <lb/>families with smaller children. <lb/>The framework provides a set of cross-nationally comparable indicators on contexts, policy measures, <lb/>and outcomes, organised on a systematic basis. The policy measure indicators presented in the report cover <lb/>leave schemes, early childhood education and care, family benefits and workplace policies. The indicators <lb/>build upon, inter alia, previous work by the OECD in various studies on family-friendly policies that were <lb/>carried out on a cross-national basis using different sets of indicators. Most of these indicators are today <lb/>available in the OECD Family Database. Wherever the OECD Family Database contains indicators for the <lb/>majority of EU member states and OECD countries, these data have been used in the present study. <lb/>Otherwise, data from other cross-national databases have been included. <lb/>Each indicator in the framework is presented as a single-standing indicator in the general absence of <lb/>scientific consensus on different aggregation weights. In the report no explicit ranking of countries has <lb/>been attempted, instead the relative position of countries has been illustrated with the help of standard <lb/>deviation scores. <lb/>In the last part of the report the linkages between policy aims and the various context, outcome and <lb/>policy measures are indicated, which help construct &quot; score cards &quot; . This &quot; score card-approach &quot; is illustrated <lb/>for three countries: Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. <lb/>The report offers tools for assessment that may be developed further, and should offer an approach to <lb/>using the OECD Family Database, acknowledging this unique data source for cross-country comparisons <lb/>in the field of family policy. <lb/>JEL classification: H2, H4, I1, I2, I3, J13, J18, J2, J3 <lb/>Keywords: Parental leave schemes, early childhood education and care, family benefits, workplace <lb/>policies. <lb/></body>

			<body>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Ce rapport présente les résultats d&apos;une première tentative d&apos;élaborer un cadre d&apos;évaluation de la <lb/>performance des politiques nationales en faveur des familles. Ce rapport fait partie d&apos;un projet élaboré <lb/>conjointement par l&apos;Union Européenne et l&apos;OCDE, qui vise à aider le groupe d&apos;experts gouvernementaux <lb/>sur les sujets démographiques de l&apos;Union Européenne pour évaluer les politiques nationales d&apos;aides aux <lb/>familles. L&apos;idée sous-jacente est de permettre à chaque pays de comparer ses performances avec celles des <lb/>autres pays. Les familles avec de jeunes enfants sont le principal sujet d&apos;analyse de ce rapport. <lb/>Le cadre élaboré propose un ensemble d&apos;indicateurs comparables entre pays sur les contextes, les <lb/>mesures politiques et les résultats, organisés sur une base systématique. Les indicateurs de mesures <lb/>politiques couvrent les dispositifs de congé, d&apos;aides à l&apos;éducation et aux soins accordées à la petite enfance, <lb/>les prestations financières et les politiques liées au lieu de travail. Ces indicateurs ont été élaborés, inter <lb/>alia, à partir des travaux antérieurs de l&apos;OCDE sur les politiques favorables aux familles qui ont été <lb/>conduites de manière comparative sur la base de différents ensembles d&apos;indicateurs. La plupart de ces <lb/>indicateurs sont aujourd&apos;hui disponibles au sein de la base de données OCDE sur les Familles. Ces <lb/>indicateurs ont été inclus pour la majorité des pays de l&apos;Union Européenne et de l&apos;OCDE pour lesquels ils <lb/>sont disponibles. Lorsqu&apos;ils n&apos;étaient pas disponibles, des données provenant de bases internationales ont <lb/>été prises en compte. <lb/>Chaque indicateur est présenté ici de façon séparée, car il n&apos;y a pas de consensus scientifique sur la <lb/>pondération qui permettrait de les agréger. Aucun classement explicite des pays n&apos;a été tenté ici ; la <lb/>position relative des pays est, au contraire, illustrée au moyen de scores d&apos;écarts-types. <lb/>Dans la dernière partie du rapport, les liens entre les objectifs politiques et les variables de contexte, <lb/>de résultats et de mesures politiques sont pris en compte pour élaborer des « cartes de score ». Cette <lb/>approche par « cartes de scores » est illustrée pour trois pays : le Danemark, l&apos;Allemagne et le Royaume-<lb/>Uni. <lb/>Ce rapport offre des outils d&apos;évaluation qui pourront être encore développés, et devrait offrir une <lb/>approche de la manière d&apos;utiliser la base de données de l&apos;OCDE sur les Familles, qui constitue une source <lb/>de données incontournable pour faire des comparaisons internationales dans le champ des politiques <lb/>familiales. <lb/></body>

			<body>FOREWORD <lb/>By Janet C. Gornick 1 <lb/>The demographic transformation unfolding throughout Europe has multiple roots and wide-ranging <lb/>consequences. It seems clear, however, that the contemporary family lay at its epicentre. Families across <lb/>Europe are navigating new realities, as birth rates have fallen, solo parenting has become more <lb/>commonplace, and older family members are living longer. In addition, in many countries, women&apos;s labour <lb/>force participation is approaching that of men&apos;s, a change that is both cause and effect of shifting attitudes <lb/>and values with respect to gender equality. Across diverse countries, the majority of children now live in <lb/>families in which both or the single parent are employed, and most mothers, as well as fathers, combine <lb/>employment with caregiving responsibilities at home. <lb/>These changing patterns of family structure and labour market attachment have created new <lb/>opportunities and unprecedented prosperity for many families. Yet these changes have also catalyzed new <lb/>problems and needs, especially for parents, who struggle with the increasingly complex task of reconciling <lb/>parenthood and employment. Demographic renewal in Europe clearly calls for the development of <lb/>improved public policy supports for the millions of parents grappling with multiple challenges: balancing <lb/>the demands of work and family, creating fair and efficient gender divisions of labour, stabilizing family <lb/>income following birth or adoption, preserving adequate parenting time throughout their children&apos;s lives, <lb/>and accessing, as appropriate, affordable and high-quality non-parental child care. <lb/>Towards a Framework for Assessing Family Policies in the European Union was produced in <lb/>response to these evolving private and public challenges. Its purpose is to aid supranational and national <lb/>policy makers, employers, and other key stakeholders as they evaluate policy instruments that support <lb/>families in these changing times. The report lays the groundwork for evaluating policies, and policy <lb/>features, vis-à-vis the main goals identified by the European Commission and in place across member <lb/>states of the European Union: increasing child wellbeing, improving gender equality, enabling the <lb/>balancing of work and family life, and, in a number of countries, raising fertility. <lb/>The team assembled to produce this report – internationally recognised family policy experts from <lb/>DIW Berlin and SFI Copenhagen – has compiled a remarkably rich and comprehensive collection of <lb/>indicators. These indicators include, first, a set of contextual and outcome variables; second, detailed <lb/>policy indicators capturing provisions for family-related leaves, early childhood education and care, and <lb/>family benefits; and third, work-family reconciliation programmes offered by employers. For each <lb/>indicator, the rationale for its selection is presented, as well as an empirical portrait of variation across the <lb/>EU-27 and OECD countries. The report culminates in an innovative exercise in which individual countries <lb/>are scored with respect to both their context and outcome profiles and their family policy packages. This <lb/>exercise allows countries to assess their cross-national positions regarding the core policy goals; it also <lb/>provides a baseline against which future outcomes and policy configurations can be assessed. <lb/></body>

			<body>The idea to develop this framework for assessing family policies emerged and developed during <lb/>discussions between the authors, EU and OECD staff. The paper discusses family policy against the <lb/>backdrop of EU employment and social policy objectives, a discussion which is also relevant to ongoing <lb/>policy debates in OECD countries which do not belong to the EU. Throughout the project, the report <lb/>benefitted from the support of both of these organisations. A draft version of the report was presented to <lb/>the EU High Level Expert Group on Demographic Issues, whose members also provided invaluable <lb/>feedback. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>1. <lb/>This report is part of a joint EU OECD project which aims to help the EU Government Expert <lb/>Group on Demographic Issues who has expressed an interest in evaluating national family policies. The <lb/>report presents the results of a first attempt to create a framework for assessing the performance of national <lb/>family policies. The idea behind the framework is that it allows individual countries to compare their <lb/>overall performance in the area of family policies with the performance of other countries. The main <lb/>interest of the report is on policies for families with smaller children. <lb/>2. <lb/>Improving a policy performance ideally starts with the measurement of its effects while <lb/>accounting for the context in which it operates. Thus a set of indicators of context and outcome as well as <lb/>policy dimensions are needed that should preferably also be comparable so that a country can see where it <lb/>stands relative to other countries. By providing a set of indicators we hope to foster international discussion <lb/>about the most important elements of family policy, and the contexts and outcome dimensions that should <lb/>be used to measure them. For this purpose, our framework provides a set of cross-nationally comparable <lb/>indicators on contexts, policies, and outcomes, organised on a systematic basis. <lb/>3. <lb/>The indicators build upon, inter alia, previous work by the OECD in various studies on family-<lb/>friendly policies that were carried out on a cross-national basis using different sets of indicators. Most of <lb/>these indicators are today available in the OECD Family Database. Wherever the OECD Family Database <lb/>contains indicators for the majority of EU member states and OECD countries, these data have been used <lb/>in the present study. Otherwise data from other cross-national databases have been included. <lb/>4. <lb/>The indicators have been selected according to their importance and relevance for three overall <lb/>policy goals: child wellbeing, gender equality, and balancing work and family life (see Chapter 2 for <lb/>further elaboration of these goals). Each indicator in this framework is presented as a stand-alone indicator <lb/>in the absence of consensus on different aggregation weights. In the report no explicit ranking of countries <lb/>has been attempted, instead the relative position of countries has been illustrated with the help of standard <lb/>deviation scores. This position therefore does not indicate a desired position, but merely how an individual <lb/>country compares to other countries. <lb/>5. <lb/>Since the report focuses on EU policy goals, the countries included are all present EU member <lb/>states, but also as far as possible other OECD countries, in order to evaluate the EU member states within a <lb/>larger setting. <lb/>6. <lb/>The choice of indicators in the framework does not reflect the idea that there is a direct statistical <lb/>causal relationship between context, policy measures, and outcomes as this would require much more <lb/>extensive statistical testing. However, the framework does present information on a number of important <lb/>indicators to be taken into consideration when assessing policy settings. In this way it provides a summary <lb/>illustration of national family (policy) situations. As part of the present study, national scorecards for three <lb/>different countries have been created by way of examples enabling these countries to assess their positions <lb/>regarding the three policy goals relative to the other countries. The approach of the scorecards is a first <lb/>attempt that needs to be further tested and improved with respect to its practicability and effectiveness. <lb/></body>

			<body>7. <lb/>The report is structured in the following way: Chapter 2 provides an overview of current family <lb/>policy goals, in particular for the EU countries. Chapter 3 presents an approach for government for <lb/>assessing the performance of national family policies. In Chapter 4, the context and outcome indicators are <lb/>presented for the topics of demography, parental labour market and income position, gender equality, child <lb/>outcomes as well as childbearing preferences, values and life satisfaction. Chapter 5 provides an overview <lb/>of those family policy indicators that are relevant for assessing leave schemes, Chapter 6 family policy <lb/>indicators on early childhood education and care, and Chapter 7 family benefits and Chapter 8 contains <lb/>indicators on firm and employer policy. Chapter 9 contains an assessment of the performance of some <lb/>member states in the form of scorecards. Chapter 10 concludes the report. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 2. GOALS IN THE FIELD OF FAMILY POLICIES <lb/>8. <lb/>Demographic change has started to affect the industrialised world and family-friendly policies are <lb/>occupying an increasingly prominent place on the policy agenda in many EU, OECD, and also non-OECD <lb/>countries. Moreover many countries have already established policies in this field. Some of these policies <lb/>and the goals behind them are very similar across countries, while others differ in their specificities. On the <lb/>supranational level as well, various political actors have set goals in the context of family policy. In this <lb/>chapter, we discuss the policy goals of the EU, one of the key political actors on the supranational level. It <lb/>is however important to keep in mind that the political responsibility for family policies has largely <lb/>remained with the member states and that any EU goals are always firmly based on a consensus view of <lb/>the member states. We also add a short description of UN goals in this field, since the UN includes more <lb/>OECD member states than just those in the EU. <lb/>9. <lb/>In general, the European Union views families as a source of economic prosperity, and <lb/>encourages the member states to incorporate family policies into their broader economic and social <lb/>policies. Already under the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs some targets and tools of the European <lb/>Union in this context have been formulated. These aims were described as important for improved <lb/>reconciliation of family and working life and for the development of policy responses to demographic <lb/>change (European Council 2007: p. 4). One aim set by the Lisbon European Council in 2000 was to <lb/>increase the proportion of women in employment to more than 60% by 2010. In 2001, the Stockholm <lb/>European Council proposed the development of indicators for the services provided by care facilities for <lb/>children and other dependents and by family benefit systems. In 2002, the Barcelona European Council <lb/>advocated that by 2010, countries should provide childcare to at least 90% of children between 3 and 6 <lb/>years old and to at least 33% of children under 3 years old. In 2006, the Spring European Council <lb/>emphasised the necessity to significantly reduce child poverty and to provide all children with equal <lb/>opportunities, regardless of their social background. The European Council of 2007 concluded that it is <lb/>necessary to emphasise sustainable family policies in order to improve social cohesion, and their decision <lb/>outlines areas of importance to family policies. Yet the European Union has stated explicitly that its <lb/>member states themselves are responsible for formulating appropriate, sustainable family policies. Hence <lb/>the EU targets for family policies are guidelines with shared objectives that the member states should <lb/>consider in setting their own policies. <lb/>10. <lb/>Gender equality, based on the equal-pay principle (article 141 of the EU treaty), is an official <lb/>policy priority of the European Union with important implications for families. The EU monitors and <lb/>promotes gender mainstreaming, and it tackles the gender pay gap explicitly through such initiatives as the <lb/>analysis of current legislation in order to urge the member states to implement existing legislation on the <lb/>provision of information about equality measures and to raise awareness about existing laws (European <lb/>Commission 2007b: p. 8). Gender equality is also promoted with the financial support from the European <lb/>Social Fund, the European Commission in its two communications, has set targets for equal opportunity. <lb/>The 2002 Barcelona targets state that efforts should be made to increase formal child care services to <lb/>enable women and men to better reconcile work and family life. Here, the services available on the market <lb/>are adapting too slowly to a situation in which both men and women work. Yet this will also involve <lb/>parental leave policies. The Roadmap for equality of women and men (2006-2013) states that &quot; fewer men <lb/>take parental leave or work part-time (7.4% compared to 32.6% for women) and women remain the main <lb/>carers of children and other dependents &quot; (European Commission 2006a: p. 5). The EU strongly encourages <lb/>men to take parental leave as well. Lindén points out that as a strategy the EU advises its member states to <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 <lb/></note>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>study closely those member states &quot; that have developed successful policies in this area, for instance the <lb/>Swedish parental leave system and its father&apos;s quota, and thus indirectly give direction &quot; (Lindén, 2007: <lb/>p. 11). This is supported by the Parental Leave Directive (96/34/EC) of the European Council, which states <lb/>that male and female workers have individual entitlement to parental leave (see also Chapter 5). The <lb/>Commission identified several areas where the Maternity Leave Directive Pregnant Workers Directive <lb/>(1992) could be improved. This Directive is one of the few EU laws in the field of social policy (Lindén, <lb/>2007: p. 10). It provides provisional measures to protect workers who have recently given birth or are <lb/>breastfeeding against the risks related to chemical, physical and biological agents. Additionally, the <lb/>Directive contains specific provisions regarding night work, maternity leave, pre-natal examinations, <lb/>employment rights, and protection against discriminatory dismissal (Council Directive 92/85/EEC). The <lb/>Pregnant Workers Directive could be improved regarding the duration of leave, the level of payment, the <lb/>access of self employed and their partners, and the protection of women returning from maternity leave to <lb/>work. The consultation document also identifies six areas where the provisions for parental leave could be <lb/>improved, providing suggestions for action on the following aspects (European Commission, 2007c): <lb/>(1) Incentives for fathers to take parental leave, (2) Employment rights and prohibiting discrimination <lb/>(making sure workers who take parental leave do not encounter less favourable working conditions), <lb/>(3) Duration of parental leave, (4) Flexibility in relation to the taking of leave (the possibility to take leave <lb/>in a piecemeal way), (5) The age-bracket of the child for which parental leave can be taken (increasing the <lb/>age limit to cover the entire primary school cycle) and (6) Payment during parental leave (linking payment <lb/>on parental leave to a workers&apos; salary). <lb/>11. <lb/>In September 2008, the social partners at the European level launched negotiations on parental <lb/>leave with a view to revising the existing EU legislation based on a framework agreement concluded by <lb/>European employer and trade union representatives (European Commission, 2008b). Additionally, in <lb/>October 2008, the EU Commission proposed a change in maternity leave revising the Pregnant Worker&apos;s <lb/>Directive (European Commission, 2008b). <lb/>12. <lb/>Another integral part of the Lisbon Strategy is the so-called Open Method of Coordination <lb/>(OMC) which presupposes that member states should define certain policy targets as a &quot; common concern, <lb/>whereas the actual choice of policies remains a national responsibility &quot; (Scharpf, 2001). The procedure <lb/>involves the participation of the member states by the formulation of national action plans, and is seen as a <lb/>method of best practice. This is a new approach applied by the EU to &quot; achieve growth, modernisation and <lb/>welfare, and is about policy learning instead of binding law &quot; (Lindén, 2007: p. 9). There are currently <lb/>several OMCs in place and the one most relevant to family policy is dedicated to (child) poverty and more <lb/>generally social exclusion. It is clear that a more formal discussion of these issues at the EU level may lead <lb/>to more consensuses among the member states about what &quot; EU family policy &quot; should be about. <lb/>13. <lb/>In its guidelines, the European Union addresses the different aspects of family policy. First, <lb/>improving the social infrastructure for families plays an important role in the fight against poverty, since it <lb/>enables parents to enter and stay in employment. It is important to provide affordable and accessible care <lb/>services for children, which includes parental education, training for care providers and daycare workers, <lb/>and leisure-time facilities for young people (European Council, 2007: p. 6). Second, family policies should <lb/>focus on providing support for families that helps to compensate for the costs of raising children, especially <lb/>during the period immediately after birth, and that takes into account the specific needs of single-parent <lb/>families and of families with a large number of children (European Council, 2007: p. 6). A final suggestion <lb/>by the Council is directed at reconciliation: &quot; a better balance between employment and security <lb/>( &quot; flexicurity &quot; ) over the life cycle to the benefit of family life, including in particular appropriate <lb/>arrangements for parental and care leave for both women and men, better access to lifelong learning, and <lb/>ensuring gender equality in employment &quot; (European Council, 2007: p. 6). <lb/></body>

			<body>14. <lb/>The new European Alliance for Families is slowly becoming more influential in the development <lb/>of a common EU approach to family policies in recent years. This initiative goes back to the year 2007, <lb/>when the EU heads of state and government decided at the European Summit of 8 and 9 March 2007, to <lb/>establish a European Alliance for Families. Through the Alliance the EU hopes to create impulses for more <lb/>family-friendly policies. The Alliance is intended as an instrument to foster cooperation and fruitful <lb/>learning from each other in the European Union. In May 2007, the Permanent Representatives Committee <lb/>submitted its &quot; Conclusions of the Council on &apos;Alliance for Families&apos; &quot; to the Council for adoption. Here, <lb/>tools and targets of the European Union, as well as opinions on issues related to family-friendly policies, <lb/>are summarised and discussed. The paper represents the EU&apos;s first step towards a European &quot; family <lb/>policy &quot; approach and was developed in close cooperation with its member states. Thus, the European <lb/>Alliance for Families constitutes one tool in a set of various family-related approaches on the EU level. <lb/>The Commission has stated that this alliance &quot; will first of all take the form of a platform for exchanges and <lb/>knowledge concerning pro-family policies and best practices in the Member States &quot; (European <lb/>Commission, 2007a: p. 7). <lb/>15. <lb/>The discussion of the actual content of the EU goals above, makes it possible to identify three <lb/>key dimensions which in our view together summarise the Commission&apos;s and thus also the member states&apos; <lb/>family policy goals: These three dimensions or &quot; aims &quot; as we will call them in the remainder of this report, <lb/>are (1) child wellbeing, (2) gender equality, and (3) balancing work and family life. These three aims <lb/>are, however, interrelated, and development in one area often depends on development in another. There is <lb/>empirical evidence that a good balance between work and family life improves child wellbeing, as the life <lb/>satisfaction of parents improves if they can achieve their preferred balance between family life and work. <lb/>Moreover, one could argue that there is a fourth dimension: namely, the need to increase fertility in those <lb/>member states where fertility rates are markedly low. Although low fertility in many member states has <lb/>become a &quot; matter of public concern &quot; none of the explicitly stated EU goals deal directly with this issue. <lb/>The 2006 Communication of the Commission on &quot; The demographic future of Europe from challenge to <lb/>opportunity &quot; (European Commission, 2006b) for instance uses the term &quot; demographic renewal &quot; instead of <lb/>talking about a need for higher birth rates. Much the same is true on the national level. Even among the <lb/>member states who have low fertility rates and are aware of their consequences, only a few countries have <lb/>made the aim of increasing fertility an explicit and official policy goal. This might be due to the difficulty <lb/>of finding evidence of clear and direct correlations between family policy and birth rates, and particularly <lb/>in demonstrating that increased family benefits (e.g., taxes and transfers) actually increase fertility. Instead <lb/>the most frequently adopted policy goal has been to make it easier for young people to have the number of <lb/>children they desire by extending public support to families. <lb/>16. <lb/>The first dimension of EU family policy, child wellbeing, focuses on children as family <lb/>members. The European Union regards an increase in the wellbeing of children and young people as a <lb/>means of helping future generations to develop to their full potential and of enabling them to contribute <lb/>more to society and to the economy (European Commission, 2008a: p. 111). An important EU objective is <lb/>to reduce child poverty, since &quot; despite overall progress in the labour market, this figure (at 19% the risk of <lb/>poverty among children in the EU is higher than that of the general population) has remained unchanged <lb/>since 2000 &quot; (European Commission, 2008a: p. 112). The EU has also addressed child health and <lb/>development, as described in the WHO European strategy for child and adolescent health and <lb/>development. Furthermore, in the framework of the programme Education and Training 2010, the member <lb/>states have committed themselves to reducing the school dropout rate in the EU to a maximum of 10% by <lb/>2010 (European Commission, 2008a: p. 26). The European Commission has stated that the best means of <lb/>overcoming child poverty is by &quot; addressing the issue on all fronts and striking the appropriate balance <lb/>between targeting the family and the child in its own right. This entails combining strategies to increase <lb/>parents&apos; access and attachment to employment with enabling services and with income support that <lb/>minimise the risk of creating trap effects &quot; (European Commission, 2008a: p. 112). Hence, the EU advises <lb/>all of its member states to apply a balanced policy mix. <lb/></body>

			<body>17. <lb/>As part of the EU&apos;s gender equality policy, the Commission promotes equal participation of <lb/>women and men in paid work, equal pay for equal work and a higher women&apos;s participation in politics or <lb/>in economic decision-making through transparency in promotion processes, flexible working <lb/>arrangements, and availability of child care facilities (European Commission, 2006a: p. 6). Furthermore, <lb/>the EU has stressed the importance of eradicating gender-based violence, focusing on gender equality <lb/>targets, and also eliminating gender stereotypes in society. According to the EU, gender stereotypes occur <lb/>in education, in the labour market, and in the media (European Commission, 2006a: p. 8). The Commission <lb/>emphasises the need to increase public awareness of this issue, and encourages young women and men to <lb/>pursue non-traditional educational paths. To overcome the segregation in the labour market, the EU <lb/>suggests that anti-discrimination laws be enforced and that special incentives be offered for female <lb/>employment. The media should present a realistic picture of the skills and potentials of women and men in <lb/>society (European Commission, 2006a: p. 8). <lb/>18. <lb/>With respect to the third dimension, balancing work and family life, the EU uses reconciliation <lb/>policies to strengthen the position of parents on the labour market. Parental employment is a major <lb/>component of family policies and it is also clearly intertwined with targets for gender equality. The <lb/>employment targets formulated in the Lisbon Strategy are thus assigned to the member states, who are <lb/>expected to develop corresponding policies to achieve them. The European Commission addresses a <lb/>variety of other family issues indirectly – for example, by setting key policy priorities through the OMC <lb/>for eradicating poverty and social exclusion. The indicator of parental labour market position may also <lb/>reflect family poverty and/or child poverty, and is thus directly related to the EU&apos;s stated goals of <lb/>improving social inclusion and providing equal opportunities. The EU describes an increase in labour <lb/>market participation as an important priority to overcome poverty, but also as a useful step to balance work <lb/>and family life. Family poverty should be eradicated by modernising social protection systems. Providing <lb/>family benefits, both universal and targeted benefits, is a key tool in combating poverty. These policies <lb/>could be implemented usefully by expanding childcare facilities, providing flexible or part-time working <lb/>arrangements, and offering financial support to families with young children. Again, the European <lb/>Commission does not explicitly state policies or set targets for the member states to meet, but it does <lb/>suggest the method of OMC (Lindén, 2007: p. 14). Furthermore, balancing work and family life also <lb/>implies improved education and wellbeing for all family members. By fostering educational attainment, <lb/>social exclusion problems are tackled in line with the overall European Commission goal of reducing <lb/>disadvantages in education and training. This particular goal is also one of the seven key policy priorities <lb/>(European Commission, 2005a: p. 6-7). The EU also advocates that its member states prevent early <lb/>departures from formal education and training. <lb/>19. <lb/>Analogously to the EU targets mentioned above – child wellbeing, gender equality, and <lb/>balancing work and family life – the non-EU OECD countries as well as the European countries are <lb/>following the Beijing Platform for Action developed by the UN during the Fourth World Conference on <lb/>Women (UN, 1995). The Platform for Action pursues the empowerment of women. It aims at abolishing <lb/>the obstacles to women&apos;s participation in public and private life through a full and equal share in <lb/>economic, social, cultural and political decision-making. This emphasises the principle of shared <lb/>responsibility between women and men at home, in the workplace and in the wider communities. Particular <lb/>interest in balancing work and family life is expressed in strategic objective F.6, which is to &quot; Promote <lb/>harmonization of work and family responsibilities for women and men &quot; under the topic Women and the <lb/>Economy (UN, 1995). Another objective advocated by the UN, as well as by the EU, is equality of <lb/>opportunity. The majority of non-European OECD countries also support the reconciliation of work and <lb/>private life following the UN Platform for Action established in Beijing. Apart from this, it should be kept <lb/>in mind that every country has its own approaches to family policy, which is true of both EU member <lb/>states as well as non-EU countries – for example, Japan, whose focus is on the relatively low Japanese <lb/>fertility rate, and Canada, whose specific focus is on legislation to improve policies on the employer/firm <lb/>level (OECD, 2008a). <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 3. APPROACHES TO THE ASSESSMENT OF FAMILY POLICIES <lb/>20. <lb/>This chapter provides an overview of some theoretical and empirical observations and <lb/>approaches to assessing family policy in order to help understand the variety of policy goals and the use of <lb/>family policy instruments across different national contexts. It also outlines the elements of a more <lb/>practical approach that countries can use to assess family policies at the national level. <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Family Policy Variation across Contexts – Theoretical and Empirical Observations <lb/>21. <lb/>Theoretical analysis of family policy programmes generally supports the common division of <lb/>countries into universalist (social democrat), residual (liberal economic), and social insurance <lb/>(conservative) welfare regimes as originally formulated and further developed by Esping-Andersen (1997) <lb/>(see also Gauthier, 2002). These groupings often correspond to regional country clusters. <lb/>22. <lb/>The universalist welfare regime is known for its universal state support for families, high <lb/>commitment to gender equality in work and care, and strong support for working parents. The Nordic <lb/>countries are examples of this welfare regime. The social insurance regime is characterised by a medium <lb/>level of support for families, mainly in the form of cash benefits that are often related to working status. <lb/>This regime tends to support a traditional male breadwinner model, where the man works full-time and the <lb/>woman is responsible for the domestic sphere. Countries traditionally belonging to this model include, for <lb/>example, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In the residual welfare regime, we find low support for <lb/>families, and the few policies that do exist are mainly targeted at groups in the population with special <lb/>needs. The state is not supposed to interfere in private matters, and there is wide support for market <lb/>solutions. In this welfare regime, we find UK, Australia, the United States, and Switzerland. <lb/>23. <lb/>In addition, there may also be a fourth model comprising the southern European countries. This <lb/>model is characterised by fragmentation along occupational lines, and by a combination of universal and <lb/>private services and benefits. There is usually no national guaranteed statutory minimum income scheme <lb/>(Gauthier, 2002). <lb/>24. <lb/>In regard to the eastern European countries, there is no general agreement on a predominant <lb/>model, given the wide variation in the institutional structure of social security programmes and the <lb/>different levels of social and economic performance among countries (Kangas, 1999; Manning, 2004). <lb/>Some would, however, argue that a separate East European/post-socialist model is emerging, which does <lb/>not fall into Esping-Andersen&apos;s categorisation of welfare models but has characteristics of both the liberal <lb/>and conservative corporatist regimes, as well as some distinct features of its own, such as a mixture of <lb/>insurance-based but universally covered schemes, high-take up rates but low benefits (Kaariainen &amp; <lb/>Lehtonen, 2006; van Oorschots &amp; Arts, 2005). <lb/>25. <lb/>Although the main characteristics of the welfare regimes appear to persist, since the 1970s there <lb/>seems to be some common response among countries to demographic changes and diversifying family <lb/>forms, constrained budgets, increasing EU coordination of policies, and global economic integration <lb/>(Gauthier, 2002). The demographic changes that have emerged with ageing populations and falling fertility <lb/>rates thus seem to have become influential drivers of policy change with regard to the need to reconsider <lb/>family policy and its role in helping men and women start families. Most countries within the EU are today <lb/>promoting the adult worker model, in which men and women are assumed equally employable, in order to <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>improve economic growth, promote social inclusion, combat problems of a shrinking labour force, and <lb/>tackle poverty. The adult worker model presupposes a new understanding of optimal ways of sharing paid <lb/>work and care work, not only between state, market, and family, but also between men and women. <lb/>Gender equality is also one of the policy drivers, but is seen by some as a largely rhetorical goal, especially <lb/>outside the Nordic countries (Stratigaki, 2000). The adult worker model has accentuated the need to <lb/>promote policies that can help men and women balance work and family life. Also, among all these <lb/>models, there seems to be more attention to children overall, but the investments focus mainly on children <lb/>as future workers, ensuring that they acquire the skills and competencies they will need on the job market, <lb/>or as Lewis (2008: 10) phrases it, more in their &quot; ability of becoming than being. &quot; <lb/>26. <lb/>This has not resulted in full convergence among different countries&apos; national family policies, but <lb/>there has been a general increase in public support for working parents across countries, attempting to <lb/>make it easier for them to reconcile work and family life. There has also been a greater focus on children&apos;s <lb/>outcomes and investments in the services provided to them. <lb/>27. <lb/>Regarding the approach to daycare, parental leave, and family policies on the employer/firm <lb/>level, Bennett (2008) outlines that in the universalist countries of northern Europe there seems to be a <lb/>societal approach to daycare that encompasses the full-employment paradigm (at least after a leave period), <lb/>so that the state provides parental leave, early childhood education and care (ECEC), and family-friendly <lb/>jobs. In the central European countries, there is a belief that the young child is better off being cared for in <lb/>the family, and consequently, leave schemes are relatively long but in general with low or no pay. <lb/>Germany, however, has been in transition since the introduction of parental leave with a wage replacement <lb/>benefit (Spiess &amp; Wrohlich, 2008). In many of the former communist countries of eastern Europe, where <lb/>daycare used to be provided to the majority of children, daycare services have been replaced by extended <lb/>leave schemes (Rostgaard, 2004). In countries belonging to the residual welfare regime, female labour <lb/>force participation is encouraged just as in other countries, but no public and/or subsidised daycare is <lb/>provided. <lb/>3.2 <lb/>Practical Assessment of Family Policy <lb/>28. <lb/>How are countries assessed in practice in most family policy models? Gauthier (2002) notes that <lb/>the literature contains two main approaches: first, the family type approach assesses the impact of family <lb/>policy in variations of family types, across a number of countries. This approach has been used by <lb/>Bradshaw and others (e.g., Bradshaw and Finch, 2002) in a series of studies of European countries. Their <lb/>analysis showed considerable differences between countries, but also suffered from the problem of the <lb/>need to constantly update data. <lb/>29. <lb/>A second approach, which has been applied, for example, by Kamerman &amp; Kahn (1997), and <lb/>Pampel &amp; Adams (1992), looks at aggregate data such as on social expenditure . This approach cannot take <lb/>into account the variation in family types, and is vulnerable, for example, to fluctuations in GDP. On the <lb/>other hand, it enables comparisons across a number of years. <lb/>30. <lb/>One may add to this approach the study by Gornick and Meyers (2003) assessing countries on the <lb/>basis of their respective family policy designs. The authors developed a quantitative family policy index in <lb/>which elements of policies were evaluated and weighted according to their supposed importance – for <lb/>example, compensation rates for parental leave or parental payment of daycare services. These policy <lb/>indicators were supplemented with data on, for example, social expenditure. In this way, the important <lb/>institutional differences among policy programmes were acknowledged while also employing aggregate <lb/>data. <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>31. <lb/>Overall, the various attempts in the literature to assess family policy depend heavily on the <lb/>research interests of the team developing the respective approach. These research interests are embedded in <lb/>various disciplines, such as sociology, economics, political science, and thereby differ in approach and <lb/>focus. Some approaches may also be designed to promote a particular policy model, and the selection of <lb/>indicators may reflect this. <lb/>32. <lb/>Studies assessing family policies sometimes result in a specific weighting of particular measures <lb/>or indicators. Based on this weighting, overall scores can be calculated. (It is important to keep in mind, <lb/>however, that even a non-weighted summary score of various indicators implicitly assumes that all <lb/>measures have the same weight.) Finally, data availability also shapes the scientific approach and <lb/>conceptualisations of family policy. <lb/>33. <lb/>This report combines previous approaches with an approach that should provide a transparent and <lb/>up-to-date analysis of the data. Overall, the writing of the report is driven by the ambition of the EU <lb/>Commission to develop a framework to assess family policies for its government expert group on <lb/>demographic issues that is independent of particular research approaches and – as much as possible – <lb/>independent of particular policy preferences, but at the same time, using a straightforward and transparent <lb/>approach. Moreover, the idea is that in the medium run, this framework should be entirely based on the <lb/>indicators of the OECD Family Database (see below). <lb/>34. <lb/>On the one hand, our approach combines former approaches by looking at outcomes for family <lb/>types and by looking at expenditure data. On the other hand, our main emphasis is on the different <lb/>dimensions of family policy goals or aims, and on the measures of family policy. This report also identifies <lb/>the aims and measures of family policies, quantifies and compares them, but in comparison to the Gornick <lb/>and Meyers (2003) approach, for instance, it does not calculate aggregate scores based on weights. <lb/>Nevertheless, we are aware of the fact that even a non-weighted summary score of various indicators <lb/>implicitly assumes that all measures have the same weight. In this respect, our approach can be considered <lb/>as &quot; normative &quot; as well. <lb/>35. <lb/>In order to cope with the great variety of available indicators, the following search strategy was <lb/>used: the primary data source for this exercise is the indicators of the current OECD Family Database (see <lb/>Box 1). In the case that no information was available or in the case of missing information for some <lb/>countries, further efforts were made to find other sources offering appropriate information. Detailed <lb/>information was available in some cases, and in some other cases no information could be found at all. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. The OECD Family Database <lb/>The OECD Family Database is a collection of cross-national indicators on family outcomes and family policies 2 . <lb/>At present, the focus of the database is on families with children. It does not include indicators on the position and care <lb/>needs of elderly family members. The database began to be developed in 2006. The aim is to provide data covering a <lb/>broad range of topics categorised into four broad headings, each of which is sub-divided into three or four <lb/>subheadings. The development of the database is an on-going process. It is intended to provide full information on 54 <lb/>indicators by mid-2009. As of March 2009, 37 indicators were available. <lb/>The four broad headings are: <lb/>•<lb/>The structure of families (SF) <lb/>•<lb/>The labour market position of families (LMF) <lb/>•<lb/>Public policies for family and children (PF) <lb/>•<lb/>Child outcomes (CO) <lb/>For each subheading, the database provides between two and six indicators, which originate from different <lb/>sources. Most of the indicators are taken from other OECD databases (e.g., the OECD Social Expenditure Database, <lb/>the OECD Benefits and Wages Database or the OECD Education Database) or from databases maintained by other <lb/>(international) organisations (e.g., Eurostat, UN). Each indicator combines a variety of statistics (e.g., the indicator SF1 <lb/>on family size and composition provides information on the size of households by household type, the distribution of <lb/>households by type, the share of households with children by household type, and the distribution of households by <lb/>number of children). Most of the information is provided in cross-sectional perspective. For some topics longitudinal <lb/>information is also available. It is intended to provide information on 38 countries, i.e., all OECD countries and all non-<lb/>OECD EU member states, but not all statistics are available for the full country sample. Some statistics cover less than <lb/>15 countries. All information is provided online. The presentation of the indicators differs (charts, tables and description <lb/>of transfer and care systems). <lb/>36. <lb/>The framework is structured according to context, outcome, and policy measure indicators. It is <lb/>important to have information on the context in which family policy is assessed, as it is obvious that <lb/>family policy depends on the overall socio-demographic and socio-economic context of a country. <lb/>Furthermore, the family policy of a country can be assessed by analysing various outcome indicators. It <lb/>is, however, worth keeping in mind that the distinction between context and outcome indicators may seem <lb/>arbitrary or at times even irrelevant, for example, whether to treat labour force participation or fertility as <lb/>an outcome or a context indicator. Most important, family policy should be assessed by analysing measures <lb/>in particular policy fields. Based on the OECD approach of &quot; Babies and Bosses &quot; (OECD, 2007), we <lb/>distinguish four fields of policy measures: parental leave policies, early childhood education and care, <lb/>family benefits, and policies on the employer/firm level. Various indicators have been selected to <lb/>describe all four policy measurement fields as well as the outcomes and contexts. <lb/>37. <lb/>Since a practical approach to assessing family policy should not cover all indicators, mainly for <lb/>reasons of &quot; practicability &quot; , we selected a certain number of indicators in each field. We propose to work <lb/>with a limited number of indicators for a core assessment of family policy. Ideally, such a core <lb/>assessment should be based on indicators that are available for a maximum number of countries and for the <lb/>most recent years. However, these two criteria still leave a large number of indicators to be analysed, at <lb/>least if the focus is on the context or the outcomes. Therefore, further selections had to be made. For each <lb/>field we propose a selection based on the current research literature, meaning that we select those <lb/>indicators that were used most often in the literature. This allowed us to develop a core framework of <lb/>indicators. If a core assessment turns out to be too limited, a broader set of indicators may be used. The <lb/>OECD Family Database and other sources offer additional indicators which could be useful for a more <lb/>extensive assessment of family policy. <lb/>2 <lb/>See http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,2340,en_2649_34819_37836996_1_1_1_1,00.html (22 April 2009). <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>38. <lb/>Once indicators have been selected for our core assessment of family policy, a method is needed <lb/>to analyse them. We base our method on the earlier work of the OECD as described in the &quot; Babies and <lb/>Bosses &quot; reports (OECD, 2007): in the chapters presenting the context, outcome, and indicators on policy <lb/>measures, the indicators of a country will be assessed according to the standard deviations of the <lb/>particular indicators. On the basis of calculated standard deviations, countries can be divided into three <lb/>groups: (1) &lt;= -½ of the standard deviation (2) -½ to +½ standard deviation and (3) &gt;= + ½ standard <lb/>deviation. Thus, for each indicator, countries are grouped according to their position in the overall <lb/>distribution of countries. For reasons of simplicity, three different symbols are used in the tables to identify <lb/>the countries: Group (1): &lt;, Group (2): 0, Group (3): &gt;. With the help of three these groupings, the <lb/>differences in a countries&apos; family policies in each field can be described in comparison to all other <lb/>countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 4. CONTEXTS AND OUTCOMES OF FAMILY POLICIES <lb/>39. <lb/>Knowledge of national contexts is crucial for understanding the possible implications of <lb/>demographic trends and for identifying where family policy interventions are needed. Policy-making <lb/>requires an understanding of demographic factors, since changes in the size, composition and growth rate <lb/>of the population can have an impact on many life domains, both social and economic. This chapter <lb/>outlines what we consider to be the most important socio-demographic and socio-economic indicators to <lb/>describe and assess the contexts of family policy. <lb/>40. <lb/>Apart from context indicators, a family policy assessment framework should also provide an <lb/>overview of the outcomes of existing policies in order to determine what needs to be changed or improved. <lb/>However, drawing a clear distinction between context and outcome indicators is often possible only from a <lb/>short-term perspective. In the long run – or even in the medium term – context measures may change and <lb/>in fact become outcome measures. Outcome indicators, on the other hand, may be context indicators in the <lb/>short run. The example of fertility may make this clearer. In the short run, it is obvious that fertility rates <lb/>are one of the indicators describing the context of national or even supranational family policies. In the <lb/>long run, however, policy measures might affect fertility rates either negatively or positively. Although <lb/>there is no clear empirical evidence on the direction of the influence of family policy, it can be argued that <lb/>fertility rates are an outcome indicator for a country&apos;s family policy. Figure 1 illustrates this <lb/>interdependence. <lb/>Figure 1. Interdependence of context, outcomes and policy measures <lb/>41. <lb/>Given the difficulty of drawing a clear distinction between context and outcome indicators, we <lb/>group potential context and outcome indicators instead according to the subject of the indicators, such as <lb/>demography, parental labour market and income positions, gender equality, child outcomes and values, <lb/>preferences and life satisfaction. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.1 <lb/>Selection of Indicators <lb/>42. <lb/>The selected indicators can mainly be found in the OECD Family Database, 3 except where noted <lb/>otherwise. In the following we briefly discuss how the indicators are selected and describe them <lb/>individually. For each group, we start with a summary of the respective indicators in a box. <lb/>Box 2. Indicators for core assessment: demography <lb/>•<lb/>Life expectancy <lb/>•<lb/>Fertility rate <lb/>•<lb/>Teenage births <lb/>•<lb/>Women&apos;s average age at first child birth <lb/>•<lb/>Out-of-wedlock births <lb/>•<lb/>Lone-parent households <lb/>•<lb/>Average household size <lb/>•<lb/>Proportion of families with no children <lb/>43. <lb/>The most debated demographic trend in developed countries is without doubt declining <lb/>population growth, which is a cause of societal ageing. Most countries are experiencing declining <lb/>population growth because the number of children being born is lower than the number of people dying. <lb/>One cause of societal ageing is that people are living longer. Low mortality levels and thus increasing life <lb/>expectancy trigger population ageing. Life expectancy is one of the first indicators presented in this <lb/>chapter to describe the variation in contexts across the countries. Life expectancy at birth is calculated as <lb/>the average number of years a person is expected to live, subject to current mortality trends. Over time, life <lb/>expectancy has been increasing in most countries, faster for women than for men. Generally, however, the <lb/>gap between men and women is narrowing, at least in Europe (Council of Europe, 2004). <lb/>44. <lb/>Among the causes of population decline is the declining number of births, which has been <lb/>experienced in all of the OECD countries over the past several decades. The fertility rate is an indicator <lb/>that explains variation in reproduction between countries, taking into account current fertility levels. The <lb/>decline in fertility is often associated with women&apos;s higher educational attainment and increasing labour-<lb/>market participation. In turn, as a result of the higher female involvement in the labour force, the <lb/>opportunity cost of foregone wages is assumed to be related to women&apos;s desire to have children. Although <lb/>the fall in fertility rates has been seen in all of the countries under examination here, the pace of the decline <lb/>and the present levels vary between countries. The decline in fertility rates started early in the Nordic <lb/>countries, in the 1960s, but stabilised around 1.8 in the early 1990s, whereas the southern European <lb/>countries, for example, experienced a decline beginning in the mid-1970s leading to currently very low <lb/>figures. Fertility rates are often calculated as the period total fertility rate (TFR), which is the total number <lb/>of children born to each woman over her life cycle if current fertility rates remained constant at every age. <lb/>Total period fertility rates are sensitive to the timing of births, that is, fertility rates may decline in severe <lb/>economic periods. Should a couple decide to postpone having a child, the total fertility rate will <lb/>immediately be affected, whereas the completed fertility rate may stay the same if the couple ends up <lb/>having the originally intended number of children. Total fertility rates are, however, often used in <lb/>international comparisons, as they are more widely available and allow the tracking of recent changes <lb/>(e.g., d&apos;Addio and d&apos;Ercole, 2005). The age group considered for the calculation of fertility is, in all OECD <lb/>countries, 15 to 49. It is, however, worth noting that some women give birth after their 50 th birthday due to <lb/>recent advances in fertility-enhancing therapies (d&apos;Addio and d&apos;Ercole, 2005), which is why age-grouped <lb/>fertility rates may be preferable. <lb/></body>

			<body>45. <lb/>Special attention is often paid to the rate of teenage births, as these are women who will often <lb/>face problems continuing their education or gaining a foothold in the labour market after giving birth, so <lb/>the teenage birth rate is reported as an indicator. <lb/>46. <lb/>One key determinant of declining fertility rates is that women are postponing having their first <lb/>child, and this tendency is considered to be the most important factor behind the so-called &quot; second <lb/>demographic transition &quot; in the OECD countries (van de Kaa, 1987). Women&apos;s average age at first birth <lb/>will be used as an indicator in this report to underscore the sensitivity of the total fertility rate, but also to <lb/>emphasise what are believed to be the associated risks in terms of childlessness and higher health risks for <lb/>mothers and children (d&apos;Addio and d&apos;Ercole, 2005). <lb/>47. <lb/>Among the countries where out-of-wedlock births are more frequent, statistics suggest that <lb/>fertility rates are also lower (d&apos;Addio and d&apos;Ercole, 2005). <lb/>48. <lb/>Another crucial indicator, usually referred to as a context indicator, is the number of single-<lb/>person households. Data from the OECD shows that from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s we have <lb/>witnessed an increase in the population share of single-person households (OECD, 1999). Not all of these <lb/>singles have dependent children, and some of them are young and elderly persons who for various reasons <lb/>live without a partner. However, we have also witnessed an increase in the number of lone-parent families <lb/>in the last 40 years (OECD, 2007). The share of lone-parent households as a proportion of all <lb/>households with children is used here to report the proportion of children who grow up in a household <lb/>with only one breadwinner, which can be an important indication of how many children risk living in an <lb/>economically vulnerable family. Across the OECD countries in general, poverty risks are proportionally <lb/>much higher among children living in single-parent households than for children living in two-parent <lb/>households, whether or not the parents are working (OECD, 2007). <lb/>49. <lb/>The decline in fertility also results both in smaller average numbers of persons overall in <lb/>households, and in a tendency to have a smaller number of children per household. We suggest using the <lb/>average household size and also the proportion of households with no children to describe the context. <lb/>Both indicators are sensitive to the age composition of the population, as societal ageing means that a <lb/>larger proportion of persons presumably live without children under age 18. Family structures are also <lb/>changing as divorce and separation rates rise, resulting in a larger proportion of households without <lb/>dependent children. However, both measures can be used as crude indicators of the tendency for more and <lb/>more men and women to have fewer children and of the tendency for some of them to remain childless. At <lb/>this stage, we do not include the number of households with children, as most data on this are divided <lb/>according to the number of children and thus would require substantially more space to report. <lb/>Box 3. Indicators for core assessment: parental labour market and income positions <lb/>•<lb/>Maternal employment rates <lb/>•<lb/>Part-time and full-time employment for women <lb/>•<lb/>Part-time and full-time employment for men <lb/>•<lb/>Statutory maximum of working hours <lb/>•<lb/>Average number of actual working hours <lb/>•<lb/>Current vs. preferred working hours of parents <lb/>•<lb/>Poverty in households with children <lb/>50. <lb/>Another set of indicators that can be characterised as context indicators in the short run and <lb/>outcome indicators in the long run refers to the labour market position of parents and the income position <lb/>of families. The obstacles parents may face in combining work obligations and childcare responsibilities <lb/>are diverse in the sense that working permits parents to maintain a certain living standard that contributes <lb/></body>

			<body>positively to child development, yet working time deprives children of time spent with their parents. With <lb/>respect to the two policy aims of promoting child wellbeing and enabling parents to balance work and <lb/>family life, countries that want to assess their family policy should look at indicators reporting parental <lb/>labour market and income positions. <lb/>51. <lb/>Given that mothers still hold the main care-giving responsibility for younger children, it is crucial <lb/>to analyse maternal employment rates. The indicator we refer to covers mothers with children up to the <lb/>age of 16. A more detailed analysis should use more specific maternal employment rates: Usually <lb/>employment rates are available for mothers of children up to the age of three, three to six, and six and <lb/>older. Employment rates usually increase with the age of the child, which is a result of maternal or paternal <lb/>preferences for employment, the demand side of the labour market, leave regulations, daycare provision <lb/>and so on. Apart from maternal employment, the type of employment is important. Part-time work is one <lb/>of the most important means of balancing work and family life. Still, part-time workers are mainly women <lb/>and especially mothers. Thus, one indicator for assessment should be the part-time employment of <lb/>women. Again, a deeper analysis could differentiate between the part-time employment rates of women <lb/>without children and those of women with children in different age groups. Moreover, part-time <lb/>employment rates could also differ by the number of average hours working part-time. This reflects the <lb/>broad variety of part-time work. Such indicators could also indicate whether part-time work substantially <lb/>increases the financial resources of families. This is important as parental employment can contribute to <lb/>the aim of reducing child poverty. Part-time employment rates for men show that this is still not a <lb/>widely used tool for taking on childcare responsibilities. Men usually work full-time and do not adjust their <lb/>working hours for family reasons. However, country differences in part-time employment rates for men <lb/>might show differences in the outcomes of different family policies. The same differences might be useful <lb/>for the analysis of full-time employment rates of women and men, respectively. <lb/>52. <lb/>Apart from adjusting working hours by switching to part-time employment, the statutory <lb/>maximum and the average number of actual working hours are indicators that make it possible to <lb/>assess a country&apos;s overall policy with regard to work-life balance concepts. They give a good picture of the <lb/>overall statutory framework and the real outcomes. Statutory working-time requirements protect <lb/>employees from being required to work beyond legal limits, but also provide information on time <lb/>allocation by employees with care responsibilities. If their statutory maximum working time is already <lb/>high, employees with care responsibilities could face greater difficulties combining work and family life. <lb/>The actual working hours also gives hints as to how parents&apos; work-life balance is affected by overtime or <lb/>other unplanned work schedules. <lb/>53. <lb/>While all indicators reported so far deal with working-time arrangements and regulations, they do <lb/>not account for the time allocations of employees during the day. Working parents and employees with <lb/>care obligations are often required to organise their duties around their working time. Therefore, it could be <lb/>informative to assess the quality of the work-life balance by comparing the actual hours parents worked to <lb/>their preferred hours of work. A gap could indicate a need for different policies to allow parents to fulfil <lb/>their care obligations as well as their working arrangements. This indicator of differences between <lb/>preferred and actual hours of work could demonstrate how the combination of national level support and <lb/>firm-level practices enables parents to target their preferred distribution of work and care. The respective <lb/>indicators are not yet available in the OECD Family Database but are planned for future inclusion. <lb/>54. <lb/>Both the income position and the employment status of parents influence the poverty risks of <lb/>their children. Parental income is another indirect indicator of child wellbeing and thus useful for the <lb/>assessment of family policy. Parental income positions can be assessed using an indicator of poverty in <lb/>households with children. This indicator is part of the OECD Family Database, and presents figures on <lb/>the percentage of all households with children and a working-age household head facing poverty. A <lb/>household is considered poor if the equivalised income of all household members lies below the 50% <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 <lb/></note>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>median threshold. 4 The percentage of families living in poverty tends to be slightly lower than the <lb/>percentage of children living in poverty. The interplay between parental living arrangements and <lb/>employment status is revealed when considering the possible relationship between mothers in paid work <lb/>and child poverty. The OECD reports that countries with higher levels of maternal employment report <lb/>lower poverty rates among children (OECD, 2008b). This indicator differs from child poverty slightly with <lb/>regard to the unit of measurement. The poverty of households with children refers to all individuals in the <lb/>family living below the poverty line – adults and children. <lb/>Box 4. Indicators for core assessment: gender equality <lb/>•<lb/>Gender gap in employment <lb/>•<lb/>Gender wage gap <lb/>55. <lb/>With respect to gender equality, we suggest that countries assess the gender gap in employment <lb/>reported by the OECD Family Database. The gender gap in employment indicates percentage point <lb/>differences between employment rates for men and women of the same age. Here, the OECD refers to the <lb/>population aged 25 to 64. The value countries assess thus measures how many women relative to men are <lb/>in full-time employment. A high value indicates that fewer women than men are working full-time. <lb/>56. <lb/>The gender gap that has received the most attention, however, is the difference in reported <lb/>earnings for men and women. Countries should therefore also consider the gender pay gap when <lb/>evaluating gender equality. Across the OECD countries, fewer women than men are employed, on average, <lb/>and they are paid less than their male colleagues (OECD, 2008b). Both the EU and the UN have addressed <lb/>the gender pay gap explicitly in an attempt to achieve equality between women and men. The gender wage <lb/>gap is calculated as the ratio of median earnings of female employees relative to male employees. The <lb/>earnings used refer to gross full-time wage and salary workers (OECD, 2008b). <lb/>Box 5. Indicators for core assessment: child outcomes <lb/>•<lb/>Child poverty <lb/>•<lb/>Children in families by employment status* <lb/>•<lb/>Infant mortality rate <lb/>•<lb/>Low birth weight <lb/>•<lb/>PISA scores <lb/>•<lb/>Literacy scores, age nine* <lb/>•<lb/>Young people not in education <lb/>* Indicator planned to be included in the OECD Family Database <lb/>57. <lb/>Child outcome indicators in various fields can be analysed with respect to both material outcomes <lb/>and health and child development (for such an approach, see, for instance, UNICEF, 2007). All of these <lb/>could, in principle, be further differentiated according to a child&apos;s age. <lb/>58. <lb/>One of the main indicators with regard to material resources is child poverty. Like poverty in <lb/>households with children, this captures the percentage of children living below the poverty line, using 50% <lb/>of the median equivalised income as a threshold. Children living in poor families face obstacles to their <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 <lb/>It should be mentioned that the broad poverty literature offers various concepts for measuring poverty. <lb/>Given the range of measurement concepts available, there are also various indicators available, which <lb/>should be interpreted with care. <lb/></note>

			<body>development. If countries want to assess their performance in improving child wellbeing, they should <lb/>consider the indicator for child income poverty. 5 Reducing child poverty is an important objective, <lb/>especially among EU member states. However, UNICEF states that such poverty measures, while <lb/>necessary, are not sufficient indicators of children&apos;s material wellbeing, since all such measurements are <lb/>based on household income (UNICEF, 2007). In contrast to the poverty of households with children, only <lb/>children are counted in measures of child poverty. This can lead to differences between child poverty rates <lb/>and family poverty rates in the same country. Children sometimes outnumber the adults per household, <lb/>especially in households that face a high risk of poverty, that is, single-parent households or households <lb/>with more than three children. <lb/>59. <lb/>Furthermore, countries can evaluate child wellbeing by using a set of health indicators collected <lb/>for babies and newborns. These measures are particularly important indicators of whether children have <lb/>had a good start in life and thus had good opportunities for appropriate development. The most frequently <lb/>used indicators in this context are infant mortality rates and low birth weights (see e.g., UNICEF, 2007). <lb/>60. <lb/>With respect to indicators of child development, for older children, literacy scores at age nine and <lb/>PISA scores can be assessed. Young adolescents are evaluated according to their school performance. <lb/>PISA scores enable countries to assess the quality and performance of their educational system. Moreover, <lb/>equality of opportunity means making a high-quality education equally accessible to all children. <lb/>Furthermore, the transition from education to working life has become difficult in recent times. The high <lb/>proportion of young people not in education in many countries illustrates the problems surrounding school-<lb/>to-work transitions. The percentage of young people not in education also makes it possible to infer <lb/>possible social exclusion. It indicates that young adolescents lack relevant skills and qualifications to earn <lb/>a living later in life. Thus, for the assessment of educational attainment, we report the percentage of young <lb/>people not participating in education. For children under the compulsory school age, there are hardly <lb/>any internationally comparable skill indicators available. Thus, no skill indicators could be assessed for <lb/>these young age groups. <lb/>Box 6. Indicators for core assessment: values, preferences and satisfaction <lb/>•<lb/>Childbearing preferences of childless women <lb/>•<lb/>Mean actual and ideal number of children <lb/>•<lb/>Reasons for not fulfilling stated childbearing desires <lb/>•<lb/>Life satisfaction <lb/>61. <lb/>Apart from more objective indicators, a successful assessment of family policies should take <lb/>subjective indicators into account as well. Values, preferences and life satisfaction indicators should be <lb/>assessed as context indicators in the short run and outcome measures in the long run. <lb/>62. <lb/>In addition to women&apos;s higher take-up of education and increasing participation in the labour <lb/>market, another factor contributing to the decline in fertility rates is also believed to be changes in <lb/>women&apos;s values and attitudes towards childbearing and gender roles (Gilbert, 2005; Hakim, 2003). Here, <lb/>we propose assessing the childbearing preferences of childless women. <lb/>63. <lb/>Often, however, there is discrepancy between the number of children that women want to have <lb/>and their actual childbearing behaviour. This indicates that women (and men) face difficulties fulfilling <lb/>their ideals for family life or for a balance between work and family life. Here, we propose using the <lb/></body>

			<body>difference between the mean actual and ideal number of children and some of the associated reasons <lb/>for not fulfilling stated childbearing desires. <lb/>64. <lb/>In order to assess subjective wellbeing, countries should use the mean of life satisfaction as an <lb/>important overall indicator for the wellbeing of all the individuals in a family. For an extended assessment <lb/>of the subjective wellbeing of family members, the indicator satisfaction with family life could be used. <lb/>This indicator is reported in EurLIFE, 6 a database on the quality of life in Europe. It offers data from the <lb/>European Foundation&apos;s own surveys and from other published sources. The indicator on satisfaction with <lb/>family life measures how content each family member is with his or her family life. <lb/>4.2 <lb/>Assessment of Country Differences <lb/>65. <lb/>In Tables 1 to 5, we present an overview of available indicators for the five context/outcome <lb/>categories discussed above: demography; parental labour market position; gender equality; child outcomes; <lb/>and values, preferences and life satisfaction. <lb/>66. <lb/>In general, information is available for all countries, but this differs from indicator to indicator. <lb/>Hence, we discuss OECD and EU averages of the individual indicators referring to averages computed on <lb/>the basis of different sample sizes. <lb/>67. <lb/>Indicators depicting the demographic situation are presented in Table 1. In regard to average life <lb/>span, life expectancy at birth for men and women in total is slightly higher on average among the OECD <lb/>countries, at 78.2 years, than in the EU-27, at 77.1 years. Among the countries in the study, the lowest <lb/>average life expectancy is found in Greece, with 69.5 years, and highest in Japan, at 82.1 years. The OECD <lb/>countries listed are widely distributed across the three SD-groups (SD stands for Standard Deviation), with <lb/>no particular regional clustering. The countries above the high SD, at 79.2, include the UK, Australia, New <lb/>Zealand and Korea, whereas the middle SD contains mainly Scandinavian and eastern European countries. <lb/>The low SD, at 72 years, includes most of southern Europe together with various countries from other parts <lb/>of Europe. <lb/>68. <lb/>The total fertility rate in the OECD countries is 1.64 children per woman overall and 1.51 in the <lb/>EU-27. The only two countries above the fertility replacement level, at 2.1, are Turkey at 2.19 and Mexico <lb/>at 2.2. Asia, most of the East European countries, and the southern European countries fell in the low SD <lb/>group at 1.43. The western European countries are spread across all three SD groups, with Germany, for <lb/>example, at 1.32 in the low SD, and France in the high SD at 1.74. The northern European countries are all <lb/>to be found in the high SD, together with Australia, New Zealand, the US and the UK. <lb/>69. <lb/>The percentage of births outside marriage as a share of all births varies significantly, with <lb/>Korea having the lowest percentage (1.3%) and Iceland the highest (65.6%). All southern European <lb/>countries placed below the EU-27 average of 34.4%, whereas all northern European countries placed <lb/>above, except Ireland at 33.2% and Lithuania at 29.6%. The average among the OECD countries is 33%. <lb/>70. <lb/>The teenage birth rate has an OECD average of 14.4 per 1 000 births. Countries with low <lb/>teenage birth rates are the Asian countries, Italy and the western European countries. The high SD group <lb/>includes New Zealand, United Kingdom and the two deviating countries Turkey, with 41.4, and the US, <lb/>with 50.3. <lb/></body>

			<body>71. <lb/>Average household size varies, with the lowest found in Latvia (one person on average) and the <lb/>highest in Turkey (4.1 persons on average). Across the EU-27 countries, average household size is 2.5 <lb/>persons per household and is slightly higher among OECD countries, at 2.6. <lb/>72. <lb/>The OECD average for households with no children as a percentage of all households is 64.5%, <lb/>and the EU-27 average is 64.6%. In the high SD at 69% are mainly western and northern European <lb/>countries. In the low SD, which is defined at 60%, we find southern and eastern European countries, <lb/>including Ireland, which is isolated at 45%. A number of countries do not, however, have data for this <lb/>indicator. <lb/>73. <lb/>The OECD average for the mean age for women at first birth was 27.8 years, with an EU-27 <lb/>average of 27.4 years. In the low SD group, at 26.4 years, we find mainly eastern European countries, the <lb/>Baltic countries plus the US, Ireland and Iceland. The Netherlands has the lowest mean age at 21.3 years. <lb/>The western and northern European countries place in the middle and high SD group, which ranges from <lb/>27 to 28 years. In these two SD groups, we also find Asia and New Zealand, the latter having the highest <lb/>mean age at 30.7 years. <lb/>74. <lb/>The OECD average for lone-parent households as a proportion of all households with <lb/>children is 15.4%, with a somewhat lower figure for the EU-27, at 12.1%. In the low SD group, at 11% of <lb/>all households, we find all of the southern European countries for which data is available, with the lowest <lb/>proportion found in Greece at 5%. The US, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are in the <lb/>high SD group. <lb/>75. <lb/>Indicators depicting parental labour market and income positions are presented in Table 2. <lb/>Employment rates of women with children aged 0-16 are on average 61.6% among the OECD countries. <lb/>The average labour-market participation of mothers is slightly lower among the EU-27 (59.5%). For new <lb/>EU members, information is only available for Slovakia (48.4%) and the Czech Republic (52.8%). <lb/>76. <lb/>Part-time and full-time employment rates are stated for men and women separately. Most men <lb/>work full-time, and the averages of the OECD and EU-27 countries are nearly the same. Among the OECD <lb/>countries, 96.2% of males are employed full-time (in the EU 96.4%), whereas only 7.2% of men are <lb/>employed part-time in the OECD member states (6.3% for the EU-27). The employment rates for women <lb/>differ, as the full-time employment rate on average is above 60% in both country groupings. Female full-<lb/>time employment averages 77.1% in the OECD countries, and is slightly higher in the European countries <lb/>(78.1%). Part-time employment rates of women are, on average, three times higher than for male <lb/>employees. In Europe, 24.1% of women are employed part-time, while the OECD countries average <lb/>25.6%. Yet male part-time employment is not below 10% in all countries. The Netherlands report 16.2% of <lb/>total male employment as part-time work, and in Norway (11.2%) and Australia (12.4%) large percentages <lb/>of men also work part-time. <lb/>77. <lb/>Concerning statutory working hours, the maximum working time per week comes to 44.4 hours <lb/>in the OECD countries and 44.1 hours in the European countries. This indicates that working time is <lb/>regulated similarly among all countries covered in the tables. With respect to working time assessments, <lb/>collectively agreed working time is considered in our table, given the widespread use of collective <lb/>bargaining in Europe. The collectively agreed number of working hours per week is the same for both <lb/>country groupings. In Europe, the average working week is 38.2 hours, and in the OECD countries it is <lb/>38.3 hours. <lb/>78. <lb/>Statutory rights relate only to the maximum number of working hours per week, but do not <lb/>account for how many hours employees actually do work – or would like to work. Therefore, we also state <lb/>differences between preferred and actual hours by gender. This sample, however, is only available for the <lb/></body>

			<body>EU-15, and hence the OECD average could only be computed for its European members. Thus, we discuss <lb/>only European averages for the indicators of actual and preferred time allocations. The average current <lb/>number of working hours for men with children is 42.5 hours per week, which reflects that the majority of <lb/>men work full-time. The average current number of working hours for women with children is 32.5 hours a <lb/>week. Men would prefer to reduce their number of working hours by a greater amount than women. Men <lb/>prefer a working time of 36.9 hours per week on average, whereas women prefer 29.3 hours per week. <lb/>79. <lb/>Table 2 also reports poverty rates for households with children for all countries, as parental <lb/>income is one indicator of child wellbeing. Family poverty rates are available for all OECD member states, <lb/>and only eight countries are not included in our sample. The OECD average is 10.6%, indicating that 11% <lb/>of all households with children and a working household head face poverty. For the European countries, <lb/>family poverty is slightly below the OECD average at 9.9%. In Mexico and Poland, the family poverty rate <lb/>is 19%. In Turkey it is as high as 20%. <lb/>80. <lb/>Indicators that permit assessment of gender equality among the countries are stated in Table 3. <lb/>Here, we report two indicators of a gender wage gap. The European source only reports data on the <lb/>EU-24. We therefore discuss the OECD average reported by the OECD database and the EU average taken <lb/>from the European source. On average, the gender wage gap in the OECD countries amounts to 18.8%. For <lb/>Europe, the gender wage gap averages 14.5%. 7 For the OECD countries, the gender wage gap indicates a <lb/>high gender inequity in Japan (33%) and Korea (38%), whereas in Europe, Germany (22%) and Slovakia <lb/>(22%) are more discriminatory in terms of gender payment than other EU member states such as Belgium <lb/>(7%). Another indicator referring to gender equality is the gender gap in employment. It indicates <lb/>percentage point differences between male and female employment rates for people of the same age group. <lb/>The OECD countries&apos; gender gap in employment averages 18.6%, whereas in Europe it adds up to 16.8%. <lb/>Here, southern Mediterranean countries such as Greece (32%) and Turkey (51%) stand out. <lb/>81. <lb/>In Table 4 we depict different indicators related to child outcomes. In addition to family poverty, <lb/>we also report child poverty. On average, child poverty is higher than family poverty in all countries. In <lb/>the OECD countries, child poverty averages 12.4%, whereas in Europe the average is 11.4%. And in many <lb/>countries, child poverty is even worse: the highest rates are found in Turkey (24.6%) and in Mexico <lb/>(22.2%). Yet, among the developed western countries, US child poverty rates are extremely high, with <lb/>20.6% of all children living in households below the poverty line. <lb/>82. <lb/>Furthermore, Table 4 reports a number of health indicators that can be used to assess child <lb/>outcomes. Particularly for young children, health measures are important as they indicate whether children <lb/>have good chances of healthy development. The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths during the <lb/>first year of a child&apos;s life expressed per 1 000 live births. On average, 5.5 deaths per 1 000 live births occur <lb/>in the OECD countries, whereas in Europe the average amounts to 4.3 deaths. Infant mortality rates are the <lb/>highest in Turkey (23.6 deaths) and Mexico (18.8 deaths), but in the US infant mortality rates are also <lb/>relatively high at 6.8 deaths per 1 000 live births. <lb/>83. <lb/>Low birth weight is also reported as a health indicator in Table 4. Among the OECD and <lb/>European countries, 6.5% of newborns weigh less than 2 500 grams. Low birth weight rates range up to a <lb/>high of 8.9% in Iceland and 8.8% in Greece. <lb/>84. <lb/>Finally, child outcomes can also be assessed by educational indicators. For this purpose, we <lb/>discuss the percentage of young people not in education by gender as well as the PISA scores for each <lb/>country. Only 6.9% of young males are not in education in the OECD countries, and about 6.3% in Europe. <lb/>For young females, the average among the OECD members is higher than for males, given the high <lb/>7 <lb/>Please note that the difference might be caused by different sample sizes and sources. <lb/></body>

			<body>percentage of young women not enrolled in education in countries such as Turkey (47.1%). The average <lb/>percentage of young females not participating in the educational system is 8.5% in the OECD countries <lb/>and about 6.3% in Europe. PISA scores range from 410 (Mexico) to 563 (Finland). The averages between <lb/>OECD and European countries are quite close. PISA scores average 499 points for the OECD states and an <lb/>average of 497 points among the EU member states. <lb/>85. <lb/>The indicators reported in Table 5 enable countries to assess values, preferences and life <lb/>satisfaction. <lb/>86. <lb/>In regard to the childbearing preferences of childless women between the ages of 15 and 39, on <lb/>average 12.3% of these women in the OECD countries and 9.6% in the EU-27 countries state that they <lb/>have no desire to have children. The proportion is lowest in Iceland, where virtually all childless women <lb/>express a desire to have children at some point in their lives, and highest in Finland, where 20% of <lb/>childless women have no desire to have children. <lb/>87. <lb/>Among all women – both with and without children – there exists a discrepancy between the <lb/>desired number of children and the actual number of children that these women give birth to when they are <lb/>of childbearing age (15-55) . The highest difference is found in Cyprus, where women generally want to <lb/>have 1.1 more children than they actually have during their fertile years, and lowest in Malta at 0.36 and <lb/>Turkey at 0.37. Thus, in the latter countries, women are closer to achieving their desired number of <lb/>children. Among the OECD and EU-27 countries, there is an average discrepancy of 0.65. <lb/>88. <lb/>Finally, women aged 25-55+ who had not fulfilled the childbearing desires they had had at the <lb/>age of 20 were asked about the reasons for this. Across the OECD and EU-27 countries, 6.3% and 7.9%, <lb/>respectively, cited financial problems within the couple, while a similar proportion (5.7% average across <lb/>the OECD countries and 6% across the EU-27 countries) cited problems combining work and family life. It <lb/>seems that women, especially in Greece (28%), find it difficult for financial reasons to fulfil their <lb/>childbearing desires, while this is less the case in countries such as Denmark, Sweden, the UK and Ireland <lb/>(all 1%), and Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium (all 2%). Among the countries with the <lb/>highest proportion of women who mention difficulties combining work and family life as a reason for not <lb/>fulfilling childbearing desires, we find countries such as Bulgaria (13%), Slovakia, Belgium, Greece and <lb/>Austria (all 11%). <lb/>89. <lb/>Subjective wellbeing can be assessed by looking at the mean of life satisfaction. Life <lb/>satisfaction is evaluated by means of a scale ranging from 1 &quot; very dissatisfied &quot; to 10 &quot; very satisfied &quot; . The <lb/>reported mean per country depicts the average answer on this scale. We report two different sources of life <lb/>satisfaction data. The European source provides an average among the EU-27 member states of 6.9. This <lb/>indicates that on average, people usually evaluate their personal life satisfaction as 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. <lb/>The missing OECD countries that are not members of the EU show a slightly higher average value on this <lb/>satisfaction scale, with 7.5. In addition to life satisfaction, European countries can also consider the <lb/>satisfaction with family life. Here, the European average is 7.8. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 5. LEAVE SCHEMES (MATERNITY, PATERNITY AND PARENTAL) <lb/>5.1 <lb/>Selection of Indicators <lb/>90. <lb/>For a family with a newborn or newly adopted child, some of the most important family policies <lb/>are those that offer the possibility to take time off work to care for the child. This chapter will present the <lb/>main indicators to consider when assessing leave schemes for families with infants or young children. <lb/>These are grouped under the themes of time and money available for parents to care for their child, social <lb/>investment in leave schemes in terms of expenditure, the actual use of parental leave, and finally, issues <lb/>relating to gender equality (see Box 7). <lb/>Box 7. Indicators for core assessment: leave schemes <lb/>• <lb/> Social expenditure on leave payments, as a percentage of GDP <lb/> • <lb/> Social expenditure on leave payments per child born, as a percentage of GDP <lb/> • <lb/> Length of maternity, paternity and parental leave in weeks <lb/> • <lb/> Effective leave (time and money available for childcare) <lb/> • <lb/> Compensation as a percentage of earnings <lb/> • <lb/> Proportion of employed parents with a child under the age of one on leave <lb/> • <lb/> Gender equality<lb/>91. <lb/>The provision of leave is intended to protect the mother before birth and allow her to recover <lb/>fully (physically and mentally) immediately following birth. It is also provided in recognition of the child&apos;s <lb/>needs to be nurtured and to establish a close relationship with both parents. Some studies from the US <lb/>suggest that full-time maternal employment during the first year of a child&apos;s life may affect the child <lb/>negatively in terms of its development (e.g., Waldfogel et al., 2002), for example, due to negative effects <lb/>on breastfeeding and the child&apos;s general health conditions (Berger et al., 2005). Leave policies also <lb/>recognise the father&apos;s needs to bond with the child, and support the equal division of childcare between <lb/>men and women from a gender equality point of view. <lb/>92. <lb/>Existing leave schemes cover a period of time in which parents can take off work, and in most <lb/>countries also include cash benefits as compensation for lost wages. The leave schemes included here are: <lb/>93. <lb/>Maternity leave is a period of job-protected leave for the employed woman, generally to be taken <lb/>during the last weeks prior to birth and the weeks following birth (or adoption in some countries). It is <lb/>intended to offer the mother and the unborn child rest before birth, and to allow the mother to recover and <lb/>spend time with the newborn after birth. Only in special circumstances such as serious illness of the mother <lb/>or the mother&apos;s death may the right to maternity leave be transferred to the father. Most countries provide <lb/>financial support to mothers on maternity leave. <lb/>94. <lb/>Paternity leave is job-protected leave provided to the employed father, normally to be taken near <lb/>the time of childbirth in order for him to spend time with his newborn and offer support to the mother and <lb/>other children in the home. <lb/></body>

			<body>95. <lb/>Parental leave is job-protected term leave provided to enable parents to care for their child, <lb/>normally during the first years of childhood. The right to take leave is individual and available to the <lb/>mother and the father, who decide which one will make use of the leave. Sometimes, a certain period is set <lb/>aside for the parent who is not on leave as an individual, non-transferable right – the so-called &quot; father <lb/>quotas &quot; often introduced to encourage fathers to take leave. Entitlement to public income support during <lb/>leave is often family-based, giving one parent at a time entitlement to claim the benefit. <lb/>Social expenditure <lb/>96. <lb/>As a first indicator for parental leave for an assessment of family policy, we suggest social <lb/>expenditure on leave schemes as a percentage of GDP. This provides an overview of public social <lb/>investments in leave schemes. In combination with the indicator on social expenditure for daycare and <lb/>educational services for children as a percentage of GDP presented in Chapter 5.2, it may indicate whether <lb/>countries emphasise daycare/educational services for children or leave benefits. A more sophisticated <lb/>indicator is, however, the indicator social expenditure for maternity and parental leave payments per <lb/>child born, as a percentage of GDP. This indicator combines the expenditure on leave schemes with the <lb/>actual number of children being born, and thus takes into account cross-national differences in birth rates. <lb/>Length of leave <lb/>97. <lb/>Another important indicator when assessing leave policies is the number of weeks available to <lb/>the parents. This is reported here as the numbers of weeks of maternity, paternity and parental leave <lb/>available in each country. The length of leave varies between countries and has varied over the years <lb/>according to cultural norms about good parenthood and childhood. Maternity leave is defined by the ILO <lb/>as at least 14 weeks, some of which may be stipulated to be taken before birth. Not all countries provide <lb/>paternity leave, and of those that do, two weeks is the most common. In the table on indicators, a special <lb/>period of time set aside for the father, the so-called &quot; father quota &quot; , is, however, included under paternity <lb/>leave although it is actually part of parental leave (and the amount may thus differ substantially from the <lb/>amount of paternity leave payments). Some countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic have for a <lb/>number of years provided relatively long parental leave up to the child&apos;s third year, for example, while <lb/>others such as Denmark have provided relatively short leave up to age one because of the imperative that <lb/>women return quickly to the labour market. <lb/>98. <lb/>With the introduction of new parental leave schemes and the increased number of weeks now <lb/>available, a frequently debated issue is how leave take-up affects women&apos;s careers, especially since women <lb/>use the majority of weeks available. Opponents of long leave schemes argue that they have an adverse <lb/>effect on women&apos;s careers and lifetime earnings. They attribute some of the gender wage gap to women&apos;s <lb/>more frequent use of parental leave (Pylkänen and Smith, 2003), and it is argued that employers may be <lb/>more reluctant to hire women in some sectors because of generous leave schemes (Fagnani, 1999). The <lb/>(unresolved) question is what the turnaround point is where the length of leave shifts from strengthening <lb/>women&apos;s labour market positions to weakening them, that is, when a leave period actually becomes too <lb/>long. Swedish studies, for example, suggest that 12 months of parental leave seem to have no negative <lb/>effect on women&apos;s wages (Albrecht et al,. 1999). <lb/>99. <lb/>Some studies have claimed that long parental leave can disadvantage the child as well. It has <lb/>been argued, for example, that the availability of long leave periods further disadvantages children born <lb/>into dysfunctional families or to second-language parents, as these children are considered to benefit more <lb/>in terms of socio-emotional development or language skills from participating in daycare programmes <lb/>(Bennett, 2008). <lb/></body>

			<body>Payment during leave <lb/>100. <lb/>The leave schemes provided may just provide a period away from the labour market, or they may <lb/>include payments to compensate for the loss of income during the leave period. A paid leave scheme <lb/>would be more attractive to parents, and the provision of a relatively high compensation rate would ensure <lb/>that more fathers make use of the scheme, since their earnings often make an important contribution to the <lb/>family budget. It is worth noting that local authorities may provide supplements to the statutory leave <lb/>benefit that make the leave scheme even more attractive. <lb/>101. <lb/>In some cases, the entitlement to leave and to a benefit may be separate, as is the case in the <lb/>Finnish child care leave scheme and the benefit scheme, and full take-up of these forms of leave therefore <lb/>depends on approval from the employer. Take-up rates will invariably reflect whether a benefit is paid or <lb/>unpaid, and any comparison of schemes must take these factors into account. Here, we suggest using the <lb/>compensation rate as given for an Average Worker (AW) working full-time. <lb/>102. <lb/>To understand the interplay between leave length and compensation rate, a calculation of <lb/> &quot; effective leave &quot; is provided, while taking into account that the entitlement to several weeks of leave is <lb/>most useful if accompanied by a sufficiently large benefit. The effective leave is computed by weighting <lb/>the duration of the length of parental leave by the level of payment, that is, weeks are multiplied by the % <lb/>payment benefit in FTE (full-time equivalent) payments (Gornick and Meyers, 2003; Plantenga and Siegel, <lb/>2004; Moss and Wall, 2007). Countries may thus provide a generous period of leave, but if it is not <lb/>accompanied by a good compensation rate, the indicator will accordingly have a low numerical value. <lb/>Thus, 40 weeks with a wage replacement of 100% has a coefficient of 40, and at a wage replacement of <lb/>50%, a coefficient of 20. <lb/>Use of leave <lb/>103. <lb/>Any national assessment of leave take-up should take two key issues into account: whether <lb/>parents are eligible to take leave, and how many eligible parents actually do take leave. Data on eligibility <lb/>are, however, rarely comparable, as they depend on national surveys with variations in question wording <lb/>(OECD, 2008). Take-up rates can therefore not be calculated, and the comparable data can only report the <lb/>use of leave. Using data from the European Labour Force Survey (ELFS), we provide an indicator of <lb/>paternal and maternal leave take-up. The indicator covers the proportion of employed parents with a <lb/>child under the age of one on leave. An approach to fine-tuning this indicator has been suggested by <lb/>Brunning and Plantenga (1999), who advocate calculating user rates instead, which is the average number <lb/>of parents with children on leave divided by the average number of working parents with children. <lb/>Gender issues <lb/>104. <lb/>Finally, we suggest using a weighted gender equality index indicator, which summarises how <lb/>national leave policies have incorporated issues of gender equality. The indicator consists of a fifteen-point <lb/>scale, with nine possible points for the portion of leave available to fathers or provided exclusively to <lb/>fathers, five possible points for the level of wage replacement during leave, and one possible point <lb/>(positive or negative) for incentives for fathers to either take their permitted leave or transfer it to the <lb/>mother (Ray et al., 2008). Scoring high on this indicator is an expression of full equality in workplace and <lb/>care-giving benefits for men and women. The value of the total index indicator is given in the table, as are <lb/>disaggregated indicator values. <lb/></body>

			<body>5.2 <lb/>Assessment of Country Differences <lb/>105. <lb/>In Table 6 the values for the various indicators are reported. In regard to public expenditure on <lb/>maternity leave, on average countries spend 0.3% of GDP for leave payments, with the highest proportion <lb/>being spent in Hungary (0.8%). If expenditures on leave schemes are calculated as expenditure per child <lb/>as a percentage of GDP per capita, the EU-27 countries spend on average 31% and the OECD countries <lb/>27.4%. Hungary spends the highest proportion (83%) and Korea the lowest (0.1%). <lb/>106. <lb/>In regard to leave length, maternity leave is longest in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (28 <lb/>weeks) and shortest in Norway (9 weeks). On average, mothers in the EU countries have 17.7 weeks <lb/>available and in the OECD countries 16.1 weeks. Of the countries that provide paternity leave, the longest <lb/>leave is available in Iceland (13 weeks), as this includes the fathers&apos; quotas in the parental leave, and the <lb/>shortest in Austria, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain, which each award less than <lb/>one week. On average, fathers in the EU countries have 1.9 weeks of paternity leave available and in the <lb/>OECD countries 2.8 weeks, taking into account fathers&apos; quotas. Parental periods vary from 12 weeks <lb/>(Belgium and Italy) to 156 weeks (Poland, France the Czech Republic and Slovakia), with an EU average <lb/>of 82.4 weeks and an OECD average of 69.4 weeks. <lb/>107. <lb/>In regard to the effective leave, which takes into account both the length and the compensation <lb/>paid, the most generous system is found in Norway, where relatively long periods of leave are <lb/>accompanied by a high compensation rate (100%) and the least generous in Australia, where the only leave <lb/>available – parental leave – is unpaid. On average, the effective leave is reported to be 45.4 in EU and 37.1 <lb/>in the OECD countries; that is, slightly more generous leave schemes are found in the EU. <lb/>108. <lb/>A number of countries provide 100% of an Average Production Worker&apos;s (AW) salary in <lb/>compensation during maternity leave. The lowest compensation rate reported is in the UK (46.2%). Most <lb/>countries also provide 100% of an AW&apos;s salary in compensation during paternity leave. Exceptions are the <lb/>UK, where compensation rates are as low as 25%. On average, compensation rates for paternity leave are <lb/>93.9% in the EU and 92.3% in the OECD countries. Compensation rates during parental leave are lower <lb/>than during maternity or paternity leave. The highest compensation rate is provided in Norway (100%) and <lb/>the lowest in Germany (11%). Across the EU countries, the average compensation rate during parental <lb/>leave is 39.9%, and across the OECD countries 45.3%. <lb/>109. <lb/>In relation to gender equality, Sweden scores highest (12 points), indicating that gender equality <lb/>is highest there, when paternity leave, paternity compensation and policy incentives to encourage paternal <lb/>caregiving are taken together, and Switzerland scores lowest. The EU countries reported under the gender <lb/>equality index score on average 9.6 in comparison to the OECD countries, with the score 8.4. <lb/>110. <lb/>Use of leave by mothers is highest in Slovenia, where 87.2% of women with children under the <lb/>age of one were reported to be on leave, and lowest in the UK, with 0.6%. Among the men, in many <lb/>countries no men are reported to be on leave. The highest proportion of men reported to be on leave is in <lb/>Romania, with 6.2%. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 6. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE <lb/>111. <lb/>The provision of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) has received increasing attention <lb/>during recent years, and it has been acknowledged that the provision of good ECEC services is of major <lb/>importance for child development – both in social life as well as in education. Research in neuroscience, <lb/>for example, studies of the effect of children&apos;s participation in high-quality ECEC programmes on early <lb/>brain development, has heightened governments&apos; interest in providing such programmes as part of life-<lb/>long learning initiatives (Myers, 2000; Bennett, 2008). Children who participate in kindergarten or pre-<lb/>school education achieve better results on the OECD PISA study (Bennet, 2008). Of equal importance, as <lb/>mentioned in Chapter 2, ECEC provision has been recognised as a means of increasing the participation of <lb/>women in the labour market. Furthermore, the provision of ECEC services has been found to relate to the <lb/>rate of fertility. According to Blau and Robins (1998; 1989), for example, countries with a high availability <lb/>of public childcare also show relatively high fertility rates. <lb/>6.1 <lb/>Selection of Indicators <lb/>112. <lb/>Merely having a high enrolment rate in ECEC services is not, however, sufficient to ensure <lb/>children the best opportunities and allow parents to participate to the desired extent in the labour market. <lb/>Other issues are important as well, such as the quality of ECEC provision and the affordability of the <lb/>services to parents. This chapter will provide an overview of indicators that are related to universalism, <lb/>affordability and the quality of services. <lb/>Box 8. Indicators for core assessment: ECEC <lb/>•<lb/>Formal entitlement to daycare <lb/>•<lb/>Enrolment rate in daycare and educational services, percentage of children 0-2 and 3-6 <lb/>•<lb/>Children attending full-time childcare as a percentage of overall provision <lb/>•<lb/>Opening hours <lb/>•<lb/>Social expenditure on ECEC as a percentage of GDP <lb/>•<lb/>Public share of expenditure <lb/>•<lb/>Childcare costs for dual-earner families <lb/>•<lb/>Child/staff ratio <lb/>•<lb/>80% or more staff members have received training <lb/>•<lb/>50% or more staff members have finished tertiary education <lb/>Universalism <lb/>113. <lb/>The &quot; universalism &quot; of ECEC provision applies first of all to the availability of daycare to all <lb/>children. This may be measured as the proportion of children in ECEC programmes for a given age group. <lb/>ECEC may include services for children under school age; for example, according to the OECD definition <lb/>(2001: 14), ECEC includes &quot; …all arrangements providing care and education for children under <lb/>compulsory school age, regardless of setting, funding, opening hours, or programme content &quot; (p. 14). <lb/>Eurostat&apos;s (2004) definition, on the other hand, includes arrangements for older children and socialisation: <lb/> &quot; any arrangement for children aged 0 to 12 outside compulsory school involving elements of physical care, <lb/>socialisation and/or education &quot; . This would include the provision of after-school care, which is lacking in <lb/>many countries and which means that many parents have problems if both want to hold a full-time job (the <lb/></body>

			<page>42 <lb/></page>

			<body>OECD Family Database includes information on Out-of-School-Hours Care, but data is not comparable, as <lb/>age groupings vary across countries). <lb/>114. <lb/>In the OECD approach, the focus is on all organised ECEC provision &quot; in centres and in group <lb/>settings (including schools) and family daycare (individuals who provide care to non-related children in the <lb/>carer&apos;s home) &quot; (OECD, 2001: 15), and this is the approach followed here as well. <lb/>115. <lb/>The term ECEC originates from the term Early Childhood Development (ECD), which <lb/>emphasises a holistic approach to the child&apos;s physical, emotional, social and cognitive development. In <lb/>contrast, ECEC places the emphasis on care affecting development and learning. Another commonly used <lb/>name, Early Childhood Education (ECE) is favoured by educational authorities, who wish to emphasise <lb/>the learning aspect, and is used especially in the US (White, 2002). <lb/>116. <lb/>Here, we will use the OECD definition of ECEC and include arrangements providing care and/or <lb/>educational services for children aged 0-6, as this is the generally agreed cut-off point in many statistical <lb/>accounts. This was also the convention used originally by the European Commission Childcare Network, <lb/>which was then followed in the OECD Starting Strong reviews (Bennett, 2008), and in the formulation of <lb/>the Barcelona targets for formal childcare capacity. This does not, however, take into account that children <lb/>may start in primary school earlier, for example, in the Netherlands, where it is common for children to <lb/>start school at the age of four. <lb/>117. <lb/>ECEC provisions may thus include arrangements for education and/or childcare. Across <lb/>countries, there are institutional differences in how ECEC provisions were initially established and for <lb/>what purpose. In some, such as the Nordic countries, ECEC arrangements were initially set up to provide <lb/>care for the entire age group from birth to compulsory school age during the times when parents were at <lb/>work. In other countries, such as Germany, ECEC provisions originally reflected the objective of offering <lb/>educational or pedagogical provision to children aged three and over before they entered primary school. A <lb/>certain adaptation has taken place, especially following the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. This <lb/>reflects the desire to tap the female labour reserve, as mentioned in Chapter 2, but the institutional design <lb/>of services for young children still in many ways also reflects this fundamental difference in objectives in <lb/>terms of funding, organisation and provision. Arrangements included under ECEC services may thus vary <lb/>and be termed &quot; daycare centre &quot; in one country and &quot; nursery school &quot; in another, although both serve the <lb/>same age groups. Family daycare is another way of providing for children, and in some countries, play <lb/>groups offer part-time care for children without parental supervision. <lb/>118. <lb/>ECEC services also differ from one country to the next in whether they are under the auspices of <lb/>the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Welfare. Until recently, comparative analyses of daycare <lb/>services concentrated mainly on educational services for children three and over, where some similarity <lb/>across systems could be found. This, however, led to underestimating provisions for the under-three-year-<lb/>olds – for whom extensive services are provided in the Nordic countries, for instance – and also ignored <lb/>services provided under the Ministries of Welfare. Today, most comparative indicators also take into <lb/>account provisions under the auspices of these Ministries. <lb/>119. <lb/>With the recent emphasis on the educational advantages of participating in ECEC, there is a new <lb/>focus on ensuring educational equity by providing daycare to all children, especially on children at risk of <lb/>educational failure (Bennett, 2008). The OECD national reviews of daycare in the Starting Strong project <lb/>showed that it was particularly children with special or additional educational needs – children with <lb/>disabilities, from disadvantaged backgrounds, or from ethnic or cultural minorities – who did not have <lb/>access to these services (Leseman, 2002). <lb/></body>

			<body>120. <lb/>Some countries have introduced legal entitlements to daycare; most of these guarantee daycare <lb/>services to children over the age of three, but some of the Nordic countries also provide these services to <lb/>children under three. The first indicator of universalism in the report is whether or not children aged 0-2 <lb/>and 3-6 are offered a formal entitlement to daycare. A guarantee of service provision does not, however, <lb/>mean that adequate services are actually available: there may, for example, be long waiting lists to get into <lb/>daycare programmes. <lb/>121. <lb/>Most countries have, however, experienced enormous growth in daycare provision in the last 20 <lb/>years. Among the EU countries, where the Barcelona targets of 33% for 0-2 and 90% for 3-6 by 2010 have <lb/>set new standards, this growth has been especially rapid. Most EU countries provide for more or less all <lb/>children aged 3-6, and some components of these services are in pre-primary education, which prepares <lb/>children for schooling. There has also been an increase in the proportion of children in the 0-2 age group <lb/>using daycare services. In this report, we use the indicator enrolment in daycare and educational <lb/>services for children, which encompasses arrangements under welfare as well as educational authorities, <lb/>and private as well as public services. It should be noted that some countries may not register arrangements <lb/>such as family daycare, which means actual provision may be higher. Also, many forms of private daycare <lb/>provision are not included, whether they are non-profit or for-profit, as is the case in Australia, Canada, <lb/>Ireland, Mexico and the US, where a significant portion of childcare is provided privately or through <lb/>informal channels (OECD, 2008a). Also workplace-provided daycare may not be included in the registers. <lb/>In Chapter 5.4, daycare provided by employers is considered. <lb/>122. <lb/>Most countries differentiate between services for children aged 0-2 and for children between the <lb/>age of three and school age, though there are many exceptions. For example, in France, crèches parentales <lb/>are provided for children 0-3 years of age, and in Italy, scuola materna is for children aged 3-6. Here, we <lb/>use enrolment for the 0-2 and 3-6 age groups, but actual cut-off points may vary between the countries. <lb/>123. <lb/>It is worth keeping in mind that enrolment rates do not reveal the number of places available in <lb/>daycare programmes, but only the proportion of children using the services. Enrolment rates thus do not <lb/>tell us whether demand has been met, which makes them a crude indicator of accessibility. Demand may <lb/>also vary between countries and over time. Cultural norms regarding motherhood and parenthood affect the <lb/>demand for daycare, as do levels of employment and unemployment. In addition, parental leave systems <lb/>vary substantially between countries, offering great variation in the number of weeks that parents may stay <lb/>home to care for the child. When interpreting enrolment rates, alternative ways of looking after children <lb/>– especially very young children – must therefore be taken into consideration. Some countries do, <lb/>however, take the parental system into account when calculating take-up rates and only report the <lb/>proportion of children in ECEC following the end of the parental leave period. <lb/>124. <lb/>The interpretation of enrolment rates is also complicated by the difference in hours provided. <lb/>While services within the educational sector are mainly part-time, either a few hours every day or several <lb/>hours on a few days with one or more days off per week, services within the welfare sector tend to be full-<lb/>time. Moreover, welfare services such as daycare centres and family daycare are mainly offered on a full-<lb/>year basis, whereas services within the educational sector are for the most part provided during term-time <lb/>only. Again, there are institutional traditions as well as cultural norms behind the differences across <lb/>countries, so full-time provision may seem more appropriate in some countries than others. Nevertheless, <lb/>in regards to fulfilling the Barcelona targets, full-time provision may make it easier for families to combine <lb/>work and family life. <lb/>125. <lb/>In order to emphasise the differences across countries in full-time and part-time provision, an <lb/>indicator showing the proportion of children attending full-time provision is included. This shows the <lb/>proportion of children in full-time daycare of all the children attending daycare programmes. Again, this <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 <lb/></note>

			<page>44 <lb/></page>

			<body>does not reveal whether there is provision in accordance with the demand for ECEC services, or whether <lb/>children are in either full-time or part-time care mainly because this is what is provided. <lb/>126. <lb/>We also report &quot; daily coverage &quot; by providing an indicator of average opening hours in order to <lb/>emphasise the variation across countries. This indicator is, however, based on the most commonly used <lb/>daycare institutions (the form of daycare with the highest proportion of children attending) and does not <lb/>take into account family daycare. Again, the average hours do not take into account whether there is ECEC <lb/>provision for the majority of the year or only during the school term. Opening hours do not indicate the <lb/>actual time that the child spends in daycare, merely the hours of care and education available to the child <lb/>during the day. Long opening hours may of course enable parents to pursue work objectives, but may <lb/>negatively affect children&apos;s relationships with their parents and reduce the amount of time they spend in a <lb/>home setting. <lb/>127. <lb/>Availability may also be measured as public investments in the provision of daycare services. <lb/>Here, we report social expenditure on ECEC as a percentage of GDP. This is divided into expenditure <lb/>for childcare (mainly 0-2 years) and pre-primary education (mainly 3-6 years) in order to emphasise where <lb/>countries place their emphasis. Not all ECEC expenditure, especially when related to social welfare <lb/>provision, is necessarily included, however. As reported by Bennett (2008), the data on expenditure taken <lb/>from the OECD Social Expenditure Database is often lower than what was reported by the individual <lb/>countries in 2004 to the Starting Strong reviews conducted by the OECD. He notes that there seems to be <lb/>some underreporting, as expenditure levels were considerably higher in the Nordic countries in the OECD <lb/>national reviews. Employers&apos; investments in the financing of ECEC services – as is common in the <lb/>Netherlands, for instance – may not be included in social expenditure data either. It is also worth keeping <lb/>in mind that social expenditure levels will generally depend on the age of the child, as expenditure levels <lb/>on younger children tend to be higher due to the higher number of staff members and also to cross-national <lb/>variation in the calculation of fees, required child:staff ratios and staff training levels. In daycare <lb/>programmes with a high ratio of staff members to children, and with staff members who have received <lb/>tertiary education, for example, costs will be higher, given that the largest share of ECEC expenditure goes <lb/>to staff wages. <lb/>128. <lb/>Expenditure levels may nevertheless indicate public involvement in this field. We have thus <lb/>included the public share of expenditure as an indicator. This indicator shows the proportion of <lb/>expenditure that the public contributes, and thus indicates how much is left for the parents (or employer) to <lb/>cover. <lb/>Affordability <lb/>129. <lb/>The financial burden of childcare plays an important part in parents&apos; decisions about whether to <lb/>participate in the labour market. Expensive services may prevent parents from using ECEC or even <lb/>applying to such programmes. Correlations between childcare costs and fertility rates give some indication <lb/>that high childcare costs may also affect decisions about whether to have a child, but this is modified to <lb/>some degree by a high availability of daycare services (OECD, 2008a). <lb/>130. <lb/>Countries may subsidise daycare provision, reduce costs for low-income or lone-parent families, <lb/>or offer a sibling rebate to parents with more than one child. Tax reductions may also be provided so that <lb/>working parents can reduce the costs of childcare. Tax breaks towards the costs of childcare are common <lb/>in, for example, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK. <lb/>131. <lb/>One indicator of the affordability of ECEC systems is the total of what childcare costs for a <lb/>dual-earner family with earnings representing one full-time and one part-time earner (calculated <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 <lb/></note>

			<page>45 <lb/></page>

			<body>according to earnings for an Average Production Worker) would amount to for two participating children <lb/>aged 2 and 3, after any tax reductions and childcare benefits. <lb/>Quality <lb/>132. <lb/>In addition to the cost of daycare, quality is likely to be an issue of importance for parents when <lb/>they choose whether and where their child should be looked after. Quality can be measured in many ways, <lb/>such as general satisfaction among parents or children with the provision of services, or the quality of the <lb/>interaction between the child and teachers/daycare staff. Often, however, more quantifiable measures are <lb/>used, such as the child:staff ratio, which outlines how many adults work with a given group of children. <lb/>The child:staff ratio is calculated by dividing the number of full-time equivalent children enrolled in ECEC <lb/>programmes by the number of full-time equivalent teachers/daycare staff. <lb/>133. <lb/>The child:staff ratio should be seen in relation to age, as younger children need more care and <lb/>attention and thus lower child:staff ratios. Often, however, age-differentiated statistics are not available. <lb/>According to Fiene (2002), the preferred ratio for younger children aged 0-2 is three to four children per <lb/>staff member in daycare centres, and a minimum of two staff members per group. For older children aged <lb/>3-6, there should ideally be eight children per staff member. <lb/>134. <lb/>Of concern when assessing the child:staff ratio is also the practice of registering staff members, <lb/>that is, whether the director, kitchen and cleaning staff, and parent volunteers are included in the <lb/>calculation of staff members. Preferably the ratios should be measured as full-time staff to the number of <lb/>full-time daycare slots, and not the number of children attending the programme, but this is very rarely the <lb/>case. Most often, child:staff ratios are reported only for the main institutional care arrangements and not <lb/>for family daycare providers (see Rostgaard and Fridberg, 1998 for an exception). <lb/>135. <lb/>Another important quality indicator in ECEC provision is the training level of staff. Good staff <lb/>training can foster high-quality social care provision. The level of training is reported here as whether there <lb/>are 80% or more of staff members who have received training. In addition, we have included an <lb/>indicator that shows whether 50% or more staff members have finished tertiary education. Also <lb/>relevant would be personal aptitude and work experience and the combinations of trained and untrained <lb/>staff. <lb/>6.2 <lb/>Assessment of Country Differences <lb/>136. <lb/>Tables 7 and 8 present the different indicators. Apart from Hungary, it is only the Nordic <lb/>countries that provide entitlement to daycare for younger children aged 0-2. Norway does not, however, <lb/>guarantee daycare to either the younger or the older children. A daycare guarantee for older children aged <lb/>3-6 is more common, except in countries such as Australia, Austria, Canada, Korea and the US (other <lb/>countries may or may not have a daycare guarantee, but no data is available). <lb/>137. <lb/>Overall enrolment is 22.4% on average for children aged 0-2 in the OECD countries and 19.6% <lb/>in the EU-27, and thus far from the Lisbon target of 33%. Several countries have, however, already <lb/>reached the Lisbon target, including countries outside the EU such as Denmark (61.7%), Iceland (58.7%), <lb/>Norway (43.7%), Sweden (39.5%), the US (35.5%) and Belgium (33.6%). For the older children, on <lb/>average 77.6% in the EU-27 and 74% in the OECD countries are enrolled in daycare or pre-primary <lb/>activities, with the highest rates in France and Italy (100%, note some over-reporting), but the Lisbon goal <lb/>of 90% provision has also been met in Belgium (99.6%), Spain (98.6%), Iceland (94.7%) and New Zealand <lb/>(92.7%). The lowest coverage is found in Turkey (10.5%). <lb/>138. <lb/>The highest proportion of young children aged 0-2 attending full-time care is found in Poland <lb/>and Lithuania (100%) and the lowest in the Netherlands. On average in the EU countries, 60.5% of young <lb/></body>

			<page>46 <lb/></page>

			<body>children attend full-time care, slightly lower among the OECD countries (57.1%). Among the older <lb/>children, aged 3-6, it is more common to attend full-time daycare. On average in the EU countries, 54.6% <lb/>attend full-time and on average among the OECD countries, 58.4%. Full-time provision for the older <lb/>children is lowest in the Netherlands (8%) and highest in Lithuania (93%). <lb/>139. <lb/>The level of public expenditure on childcare provision mainly for 0-2-year-olds as a percentage <lb/>of GDP is highest in Iceland (0.7%) and lowest in Mexico (at 0.0%). On average, the EU countries spend <lb/>0.26% of GDP on childcare, and the OECD countries spend 0.27%. For pre-primary education, mainly for <lb/>children aged 3-6, average levels are somewhat higher: 0.44% in the EU countries and 0.34% in the OECD <lb/>countries. <lb/>140. <lb/>Public funding for ECEC for 0-2 year-olds covers on average 82% of total costs in EU <lb/>countries, that is, leaving 18% of costs to be covered by parents and/or employers, and also 82% in OECD <lb/>countries. The public share is highest in Ireland (100%) and lowest in the Netherlands (64.5%). For older <lb/>children, aged 3-6, the EU and the OECD average public funding both cover 94%. In many countries, <lb/>public funding covers 100% of expenditure, with the lowest level covered by the public in Denmark <lb/>(75%). <lb/>141. <lb/>In Table 8, the average opening hours of the most commonly used daycare services are reported. <lb/>These vary from seven hours per day (Spain) to 11.5 hours (in Sweden for younger children aged 0-2), <lb/>with an EU and OECD average of 9.3. For older children, much provision is offered part-time, and opening <lb/>hours for 3-6-year-olds vary from four hours per day (Greece and Ireland) to 11.5 hours (Sweden). <lb/>142. <lb/>In daycare programmes, average child:staff ratios are in general higher for the younger children <lb/>aged 0-2. They are lowest in Denmark, with 3.3 children per staff member, and highest in Australia, with <lb/>7.5 children per staff member. For the countries reporting data for the age group 3-6, the highest number of <lb/>children per staff member is found in Norway and the UK (8 children). For countries reporting only for the <lb/>whole age group 0-6, the highest number of children per staff member is found in Portugal (11 children) <lb/>and the lowest in the US (5 children). In pre-school programmes, the EU average is 13.8 children per staff <lb/>member and the OECD average 14.8 children, being highest in Mexico (28.3 children) and lowest in <lb/>Denmark (6.9 children). <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 7. FAMILY BENEFITS <lb/>143. <lb/>This chapter explores possible methods of assessing the differences in the availability and <lb/>generosity of family benefits in OECD and EU countries. Family benefits are understood as a means to <lb/>compensate for the costs associated with rearing children. On the one hand, families face higher needs than <lb/>other households. On the other, the earnings capacity (or labour supply) is restricted due to childcare <lb/>obligations. Although the restrictions differ according to the design of the early childhood education and <lb/>care system (see Section 5.1) and the prevalence of family-oriented policies on the employer or firm level <lb/>(see Section 5.4), it is not likely that such policies fully level out the differences between families and other <lb/>households. As a consequence, families with children are more economically vulnerable. In many <lb/>countries, families with more than two children or lone-parent families face a higher poverty risk than <lb/>other households. Family benefits can play a crucial role in limiting the economic disadvantages of <lb/>families. If we assume a negative relationship between economic strain and child wellbeing, family <lb/>benefits may help to better achieve this policy aim. Family benefits may also play an indirect role in <lb/>balancing work and family life, as they reduce the need to be fully active in the labour market. <lb/>144. <lb/>In general, we can distinguish between family cash allowances, family-related tax reductions, and <lb/>family-related elements of the social insurance system. With regard to the latter, the main focus is on <lb/>family-related reductions in employee social security contributions (for a discussion of other, more indirect <lb/>aspects, such as family-related elements of the old-age pension system, see Dingeldey 2000). There are a <lb/>number of approaches to capturing differences between countries in the availability and generosity of <lb/>family benefits (for an overview, see Gauthier, 1999). Each of the approaches is characterised by its own <lb/>advantages or disadvantages; each one alludes to specific features of the family benefit system and ignores <lb/>others (see also Chapter 3). Therefore, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of family benefits in <lb/>a large number of countries, it is necessary to combine evidence gathered using different approaches. We <lb/>rely mainly on the expenditure approach and the model family approach, both of which we discuss in the <lb/>following. <lb/>7.1 <lb/>General Approaches <lb/>145. <lb/>The expenditure approach uses data on public social expenditure to assess a given country&apos;s <lb/>welfare effort. Many of the classic studies on the welfare state are based on the expenditure approach <lb/>(e.g., Wilensky, 1975). This approach is also used in studies with a specific focus on family policies, <lb/>including family benefits (see, e.g., Pampel and Adams, 1992; Kamerman and Kahn, 1997; Guo and <lb/>Gilbert, 2007). The expenditure approach has been criticised for various reasons (see Esping-Andersen, <lb/>1990; Gauthier, 1999). First, expenditure data do not reveal whether a given level of expenditure is due to <lb/>the provision of low benefits to a large share of the population (broad coverage) or to the provision of high <lb/>benefits to a small share of the population (narrow coverage). Qualitative differences in the family benefit <lb/>system that yield differential outcomes in terms of family wellbeing are not captured adequately. Second, <lb/>internationally comparable expenditure data contain information about expenditure on broad categories of <lb/>programmes rather than on individual measures. Some studies look at social expenditure on family policies <lb/>in general, which includes expenditure on family benefits, parental leave policies and family services (see, <lb/>e.g., Siaroff, 1994; Guo and Gilbert, 2007). The differential outcomes of different provisions of leave <lb/>policies, benefits, or services from one country to the next cannot be evaluated based on such broad <lb/>expenditure categories. However, the available expenditure data have become richer in detail, with the <lb/>consequence that expenditure on family benefits can be analysed separately from other types of family <lb/></body>

			<body>policy expenditure. A third objection, which is related to the second, is that – due to the complexity of <lb/>expenditure data (which captures all types of social expenditure) – it is sometimes difficult to achieve full <lb/>comparability between countries. Similar policies may fall into different fields of competence and be dealt <lb/>with by different government agencies from one country to the next, and may thus be counted as different <lb/>types of expenditure (e.g., care or education). <lb/>146. <lb/>Despite these objections, which we will have to account for when we compare countries on the <lb/>basis of such indicators, the expenditure approach has some distinct advantages. First, expenditure data is <lb/>available for a large number of countries in highly standardised databases, which are updated on a regular <lb/>basis and allow for broad cross-country comparisons. Second, expenditure data allow for a comprehensive <lb/>overview, as all types of expenditure on family policy are included. However, the inclusion of information <lb/>on tax reductions as a third type of family expenditure has not yet been fully implemented. The OECD has <lb/>systematically begun to include such information (see OECD, 2007). However, up to now, these data are <lb/>not available for all countries, and there is some unclarity about how the issue is handled in the other <lb/>databases. <lb/>147. <lb/>While the expenditure approach is most useful to provide a broad overview of the family-related <lb/>welfare effort of a given country, the model family approach aims at providing information about the level <lb/>and structure of benefits at the individual level. The basic idea is to calculate the size of the benefit <lb/>package for a number of family types that differ, for instance, in the level of earnings and the number and <lb/>age of the children. In addition, most studies differentiate between lone parents and couples. The approach <lb/>allows for the inclusion of all aspects of the tax-benefit system, such as tax reductions, family-related <lb/>components of the social insurance system, family allowances, housing benefits and social assistance <lb/>payments (see, e.g., Bradshaw and Finch, 2002). This approach is illustrative, as it provides information on <lb/>the level of individual types of benefits at the family level and not at a highly aggregated level. However, <lb/>the computation of the family benefit package on a wide range of model families is demanding, as it <lb/>requires detailed knowledge of a country&apos;s tax-benefit system. Therefore, all studies rely on networks of <lb/>country experts to provide the necessary information. This often works as a restriction on the number of <lb/>countries included. But compared to earlier studies (see, e.g., Bradshaw and Piachaud, 1980), more recent <lb/>studies have gained in terms of the number of countries covered (Bradshaw and Finch, 2002; Bradshaw, <lb/>2006; OECD, 2007). Still, the information is available for individual years or a few years only, and is not <lb/>– like expenditure data – updated on a regular basis, which means that the indicators may soon be outdated. <lb/>Bradshaw (2006) looks at changes in the family benefit package from 2001 to 2004. However, the <lb/>comparison is based on a small sample of countries, and it is unclear whether Jonathan Bradshaw or other <lb/>researchers will prepare further updates. The OECD tax-benefit models could provide a basis for <lb/>continuous reporting of such indicators. However, the respective indicators are not included in the OECD <lb/>Family Database. 8 <lb/>148. <lb/>A second criticism refers to the problem that the results on the various model families cannot be <lb/>generalised at a population level. Every study can provide information on a selected range of model <lb/>families only, which does not allow for generalisation to families of different sizes, structures and earnings. <lb/>Since the share of these &quot; other &quot; family types differs between countries, the model families will represent a <lb/>smaller or larger share of the population in each country. Hence, depending on the choice of model <lb/>families, the approach may yield different results for the same country. Furthermore, the method has the <lb/>disadvantage of producing numerous different indicators. This is not a disadvantage per se, as it reflects the <lb/>variation in the family benefit package by family type. But to allow for easy comparisons, some studies <lb/>(see, e.g., Bradshaw et al., 1993) also provide average values over all family types. However, as these <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">8 <lb/>Instead, the Family Database provides a detailed description of the child benefit systems (indicator PF3) <lb/>including information on the level of benefits, variation by family size, age of children and aspects of <lb/>means-testing. <lb/></note>

			<body>averaged values are usually not weighted by the prevalence of a given family type, and the range of model <lb/>families does not cover all families in a given country, such indicators do not provide a representative <lb/>estimation of the average family package in a given country. A third issue has been raised as a <lb/>disadvantage, but it can be read as an advantage as well. The approach is based on a mere description of <lb/>the tax-benefit system and does not reflect the level of benefits families actually receive (Gauthier, 1999: <lb/>45). In the case of non-take-up of benefits, the model family approach will overestimate the impact of <lb/>family policy on problems such as child poverty. However, this can also be regarded as a strong point of <lb/>the approach, as it provides a full picture of the policy framework and allows for analyses that are able to <lb/>differentiate between policy effects and family behaviour. 9 In providing instructive results on how different <lb/>policies (are intended to) affect the economic situation of a broad range of family types, the model family <lb/>approach convincingly complements the representative but unspecific perspective of the expenditure <lb/>approach. Therefore, an evaluation of family benefits needs to take into account both perspectives. <lb/>149. <lb/>Although the combination of both approaches already provides a detailed overview of country <lb/>differences in the field of family benefits, information from a third source may be added. As described <lb/>above, the model family approach provides information at the policy level, while it cannot take into <lb/>account the actual payment of transfers. The expenditure approach reflects the payment of transfers at a <lb/>highly aggregated level only. Comparative micro-data on income, such as the Luxembourg Income Study <lb/>(LIS) or the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), allow for the assessment of the <lb/>impact of family benefits at the household level. These databases provide detailed information on the <lb/>income package of households. Thus, family benefits can be separated from other types of income, and this <lb/>information can be used to calculate the average value of family benefits or their share of total family <lb/>income. Such databases allow not only for an evaluation of the size of benefits but also for detailed <lb/>analyses of the distributional impact of such measures. Therefore, such data are usually provided in studies <lb/>on poverty or the income distribution (see, e.g., Whiteford and Adema, 2007). However, respective <lb/>indicators have also been included in studies on family policy (Gornick and Meyers, 2001) and in the <lb/>OECD Family Database. 10 <lb/>7.2 <lb/>Selection of Indicators <lb/>150. <lb/>As in the previous chapters, we provide an overview on the country differences on the basis of a <lb/>selection of the available indicators. We suggest a combination of evidence from expenditure data and <lb/>from indicators derived from the model family approach. The core assessment looks at four main areas: <lb/>(1) the level of public expenditure on cash family benefits and its relation to total expenditure on family <lb/>policy, (2) the level of family benefits, (3) the variation in the level of benefits according to family <lb/>characteristics such as earnings level, family size and family type and, (4) the gender-neutrality of the tax-<lb/>benefit system. As discussed above, expenditure data is available from different sources. We suggest using <lb/>indicators from the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX) and the European System of Integrated <lb/>Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS). The main reason for including an additional database is that <lb/>ESSPROS provides information on all non-OECD EU countries, for which comparable data on family <lb/>policies are still scarce. Combined, the two databases cover the full sample of OECD and EU countries <lb/>9 <lb/>However, this view ignores that the design of policy measures (e.g., means-testing) and administrative <lb/>procedures have an influence on the process of claiming benefits and on the non-take-up rate (van <lb/>Oorschot 1991). <lb/>10 <lb/>The OECD Family Database contains an indicator on the level of child support (PF5). However, the <lb/>indicator on the level of benefits covers only a small set of countries and is therefore not included. <lb/></body>

			<body>(see indicator PF1 in OECD FDB). 11 Since the two databases are not fully comparable, the ESSPROS data <lb/>should be reported also for the countries covered in SOCX. There are no or tiny deviations for many <lb/>countries, but some distinct differences for some countries, which we discuss when presenting the data. <lb/>SOCX as well as ESSPROS provide detailed information on different types of expenditure on family <lb/>policy; in ESSPROS, for example, expenditures are subdivided into 48 categories. In order to assess the <lb/>basic characteristics of the general focus of a country&apos;s family policy, we first present information on total <lb/>public expenditure on family policy. In addition, we distinguish the aggregate categories of cash benefits <lb/>(and as a subcategory child or family allowances), in-kind benefits and tax breaks. The databases allow <lb/>for additional comparisons of differences in targeting (means-tested vs. non-means-tested expenditure), <lb/>periodic and lump-sum payments, and other details that we do not include in our core assessment. <lb/>Box 9. Indicators for core assessment: family benefits <lb/>•<lb/>Total public expenditure on family policy <lb/>•<lb/>Public expenditure on cash benefits <lb/>•<lb/>Public expenditure in kind <lb/>•<lb/>Tax breaks <lb/>•<lb/>Public expenditure on child or family allowances <lb/>•<lb/>Size of family benefit package by level of earnings <lb/>•<lb/>Size of family benefit package by family size <lb/>•<lb/>Size of family benefit package by family type <lb/>•<lb/>Gender-neutrality of tax-benefit system <lb/>151. <lb/>While many details can be omitted because the respective benefits represent just a tiny share of <lb/>total expenditure (and therefore do not exhibit strong variation between countries), there are crucial <lb/>distinctions in the targeting of benefit systems. However, we do not suggest addressing the targeting of <lb/>benefits based on expenditure data (means-tested, non-means-tested spending), but based on the <lb/>comparison of model families at different earnings levels. In our view, the evidence provided by the model <lb/>family approach is more illustrative for assessing the crucial differences in the family benefit spending <lb/>patterns of different countries. But how is variation by earnings level addressed in the model family <lb/>approach in recent studies? Bradshaw and Finch (2002) and Bradshaw (2006) examine different earnings <lb/>constellations within families, for example, couples with no earner or with one or two earners at a half or <lb/>full average wage. If the size of the family benefit package is dependent on the earnings level, we will find <lb/>variation by earnings constellation. If family benefits are granted independently of the level of earnings <lb/>(such as a non-means-tested child allowance), the size will not vary. The indicators provided by the OECD <lb/>(2007: 77) differentiate between even more earnings levels (0%, 25%, 50%, … 200% of the average <lb/>wage). Furthermore, the OECD indicators cover a larger sample of countries than the studies by Bradshaw <lb/>and Finch (2002) and Bradshaw (2006). Therefore, we will report the OECD indicators on the size of the <lb/>family benefit package by level of earnings. However, it is not necessary to provide information on the <lb/>full range of income levels as indicators in the core assessment. Instead we report the size of the family <lb/>benefit package for a family with average earnings, which provides information about the generosity of <lb/>family benefits for an average family. If (some) benefits are means-tested, these values are informative <lb/>about a certain range of earnings only. Therefore the OECD computes what could be called a &quot; targeting <lb/>ratio &quot; . This compares the level of benefits for those with high earnings (200% AW) to those with no <lb/>earnings (0% AW). In the case of targeting, this ratio is greater than one. If there is no targeting of benefits <lb/>11 <lb/>In the latest update of the Family Database the OECD has also used ESSPROS data for countries that are <lb/>not included in the SOCX database. In addition, the latest version of the FDB contains updated SOCX data <lb/>(2005). But as some of the more detailed SOCX data used in this report are not yet publicly available (only <lb/>data on broad categories), we use the 2003 version of the SOCX data. <lb/></body>

			<body>and no earnings-dependent tax breaks, the ratio equals one. 12 If the measures – such as tax breaks – affect <lb/>rich families more than poor families, the ratio is below one. <lb/>152. <lb/>In a similar manner, one can assess the variation in the level of family benefits by family size <lb/>and family type (lone parents vs. couples). We selected as core indicators the level of family benefits of a <lb/>family with one child (aged seven) as well as a ratio that compares the benefits for a third child who is 17 <lb/>years old ( &quot; family size ratio &quot; ). Unfortunately, there is no information on families of different sizes with <lb/>children in the same age group. Therefore the ratio refers to differences in the benefits for additional <lb/>children but also to differences by the age of the child. If this ratio is greater than one, the tax-benefit <lb/>system in a given country favours larger families and/or older children. In addition, indicators are available <lb/>to assess the level of benefits for lone parents and couples in order to see whether different countries&apos; <lb/>family policies take the situation of lone parents specifically into account. Up to now, the OECD has not <lb/>published results based on the model family approach that allow for a differentiation of families of <lb/>different size and type. Therefore, we use the most recent data collected by Bradshaw and colleagues (see <lb/>Bradshaw, 2006), although the study covers only 21 countries. An advantage of this study is that the data <lb/>are fully documented, so they can be used to calculate the size of the family benefit package as a <lb/>percentage of an average worker&apos;s wage (i.e., producing the same measure as used by the OECD). In <lb/>addition, the results refer to the same year (2004). Again, the data available are rich in detail, but we will <lb/>report only selected indicators. These are, however, able to give hints about the &quot; preferences &quot; of countries&apos; <lb/>tax-benefits systems towards smaller or larger families and towards lone parents or couples. 13 <lb/>153. <lb/>The OECD Family Database offers an alternative approach. It provides information on the level <lb/>of family allowances in comparison to an average worker&apos;s wage (indicator PF1). In addition, the database <lb/>contains information on the general characteristics of the family allowance system in a given country (e.g., <lb/>differences in the level of benefits by age of child, by size of family, by income level). However, the <lb/>information is provided in qualitative terms only. The quantitative indicator on the level of child <lb/>allowances refers to the maximum benefit for one child between age 3 and 12. But particularly in countries <lb/>with means-testing or strong differences in the level of benefits by family size, the full amount will be paid <lb/>only to a small share of families. Therefore, for the core assessment we are using the information derived <lb/>from the family model approach, which provides quantitative information on a large variety of family <lb/>types. <lb/>154. <lb/>The expenditure data and the indicators based on the model family approach provide information <lb/>on the relevance of family benefits in general and the variation in the level of benefits according to the <lb/>structure, size and earnings of families. In a last step in the core assessment, we propose to use indicators <lb/>on the gender-neutrality of tax-benefit systems (PF4). With regard to gender equality, the extent to <lb/>which the tax-benefit system sets incentives for an equal division of labour is crucial. A simple indicator <lb/>that addresses this issue is whether a couple&apos;s earnings are taxed jointly or individually. However, <lb/>individualised tax systems also have elements that take into account an earner&apos;s family context, such as <lb/>child or partner tax breaks, which may yield similar outcomes to joint taxation systems (see Dingeldey, <lb/>2001). We therefore suggest assessing potential differences between countries on the basis of the tax rates <lb/>of model families, which differ by the division of labour between partners. Using information from the <lb/>OECD tax-benefit model, we compare the tax rates of a single-earner family (earnings at 133% of the <lb/>average wage) with a dual-earner family, where both partners earn 67% of the average rate. <lb/></body>

			<body>7.3 <lb/>Assessment of Country Differences <lb/>155. <lb/>Tables 9, 10 and 11 present an overview of the indicators for all countries (as far as information <lb/>is available). As in previous sections of this report, we briefly discuss OECD and EU averages of the <lb/>individual indicators. However, since the number of countries differs from indicator to indicator, the <lb/>average values are computed on the basis of different samples. <lb/>156. <lb/>We discuss expenditure data first. We will comment separately on ESSPROS and SOCX data only <lb/>if there are relevant differences. OECD countries spend 2.2% of their GDP on family policy. Depending on <lb/>our data source, average expenditure in EU countries is slightly higher or lower. The total public <lb/>expenditure on family policy ranges from less than 1% to about 4% of GDP. Expenditure on cash benefits <lb/>is about 1.5% in the OECD and EU countries. In-kind expenditure is significantly lower. The data on <lb/>expenditure in the form of tax breaks is available for OECD countries only (with some countries missing). <lb/>As tax breaks are not always used to support families, the expenditure is zero in many countries. The OECD <lb/>and EU averages are therefore below 0.5%. The indicators discussed so far allow for a general overview of <lb/>family policy expenditure. As the broad category of cash benefits contains expenditure on parental leave as <lb/>well as on child or family allowances, we provide an additional, more detailed indicator. It shows that, on <lb/>average, the OECD and EU countries spend around 1% of GDP on child or family allowances. This is about <lb/>two thirds of the total expenditure on cash benefits. However, countries such as Denmark or Sweden put an <lb/>emphasis on parental leave compensation and therefore exhibit only average spending on family allowances <lb/>despite an overall high expenditure on total cash benefits. In Germany and Ireland, a larger share of cash <lb/>benefits goes into family allowances rather than into parental leave compensation. <lb/>157. <lb/>A detailed comparison of SOCX and ESSPROS data reveals important differences between a <lb/>number of countries. In some countries, there are large differences in the level of in-kind expenditure (e.g., <lb/>France). A likely explanation is that part of the expenditure in the ESSPROS data on childcare is not <lb/>counted as in-kind expenditure on family policy but on education. Differences in the level of cash spending <lb/>can be explained by expenditure that may be classified either as social assistance or family expenditure <lb/>(e.g., in the UK). There also appear to be different approaches to how to classify expenditure on tax breaks. <lb/>Expenditure on cash benefits and tax breaks for some countries in SOCX approximately add up to the <lb/>expenditure on cash benefits in ESSPROS (e.g., Germany). However, it is unclear whether this is the only <lb/>reason for these differences (for a brief discussion of differences between SOCX and ESSPROS data, see <lb/>also Math and Thévenon, 2008). <lb/>158. <lb/>The family model approach provides information on the level of benefits at the family level. At <lb/>average earnings, the family benefit package of a family is worth on average about 10% of the average <lb/>wage. In many countries, the size of the package depends on earnings. Therefore, the targeting ratio (ratio <lb/>of 0% AW to 200% AW) is on average greater than one. The difference between the OECD average ratio <lb/>(2.5) and the EU average ratio (1.6) is explained by the fact that in some non-EU OECD countries, family <lb/>benefits are strongly targeted (e.g., Australia, Canada, Korea). In some countries the family benefit <lb/>package differs sharply by family size. In Table 10, this is expressed in the indicator for the difference <lb/>between the benefit for the third child and that for the first child. On average, the benefit for the third child <lb/>is about two percentage points (percentage of an average wage) higher than for the first child. The situation <lb/>for single parents in terms of the family benefits package is not preferable in all countries. Comparing the <lb/>family benefit packages by family type shows that in Belgium, Sweden and the Slovak Republic, taxes <lb/>and benefits place single parents in a worse position than couples without children. In comparison to <lb/>couples with children, the benefits for single parents are the same or lower in a larger number of countries, <lb/>with some notable exceptions like Austria and Norway. On average, the family benefit packages of single <lb/>parents are about the same as those of couples with children at the same wage level in the OECD countries <lb/>(-0.2) and are smaller on average in the EU countries. <lb/></body>

On average, <lb/>the tax rate for single-earner couples is 21.3% in the OECD countries and 23.3% in the EU countries. It is <lb/>on average smaller for dual-earner couples (at the same level of family earnings – 133% of an average <lb/>wage). Hence, most countries support an equal division of paid labour in families or tax single-earner and <lb/>dual-earner couples in the same manner. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 8. POLICIES ON THE EMPLOYER/FIRM LEVEL <lb/>160. <lb/>Policies on the employer/firm level are another group of measures that allow parents – or people <lb/>with care-giving responsibilities in general – to balance work and family life. Moreover, policies on the <lb/>employer/firm level can promote gender equality and child wellbeing. People with care obligations need <lb/>flexibility in organising their time during the day. Hence, for employed parents balancing work and family <lb/>life involves not only the distribution of childcare (see Chapter 6) and parental leave (see Chapter 5), but <lb/>also policies on the employer/firm level, such as flexible working hours and particular family-friendly <lb/>workplace arrangements. One might argue that policies on the employer/firm level are of less importance <lb/>for the assessment of family policy on the state level, given their narrow focus on the firm or employer. <lb/>Nevertheless, there is a clear connection between family-friendly workplaces and outcomes for society and <lb/>the economy as a whole (see Chapter 3). Moreover, new approaches to national family policy – such as <lb/>those introduced in Germany – focus much more on employers than former policy approaches did. Other <lb/>countries, like the Netherlands, have a longer tradition of employer support for families, such as the <lb/>co-financing of childcare. <lb/>161. <lb/>In this vein, joint efforts by the government and employers to improve workplaces are one <lb/>potential instrument for family policy. Given the increasing importance of such approaches, countries need <lb/>indicators to assess family policies that reflect and influence workplace practices. <lb/>162. <lb/>In general, one can distinguish between sets of workplace practices that either are enforced by <lb/>law on the national or sub-national level or are agreed upon between unions and employers or within the <lb/>firms themselves. At the firm level, four types of family-friendly working arrangements can be <lb/>distinguished: flexible working arrangements, special leave arrangements, special childcare arrangements <lb/>and other supportive arrangements (originally developed by Den Dulk, 2001). With regard to leave and <lb/>childcare arrangements, the measures provided at the firm level are often complementary to parental leave <lb/>and childcare provided on the national level, as discussed in the preceding chapters. Thus, leave <lb/>arrangements offered by employers are often provided for family reasons (e.g., sick child leave). Childcare <lb/>arrangements at the firm level may include workplace nurseries, contractually guaranteed slots in outside <lb/>childcare facilities, or financial assistance (for an overview, see Den Dulk, 2001). Flexible time <lb/>arrangements are the most common approach by employers to enable employees to reconcile work and <lb/>care responsibilities. Other supportive measures offer possibilities such as work-family management <lb/>training or employee counselling. So far, these services are not widespread among firms, and there are <lb/>hardly any representative internationally comparable data on this. <lb/>8.1 <lb/>General Approach <lb/>163. <lb/>On the firm level, two ways of balancing work and family life can be distinguished (Den Dulk, <lb/>2001): providing facilities that ease the burden of childcare, or giving employees the flexibility to adjust <lb/>their work to their childcare responsibilities. Flexible working-time arrangements on the firm level consist <lb/>of part-time work, flexitime, telework, and banking hours. Many analyses focus on part-time work as the <lb/>most common work-family arrangement. For Europe, the Establishment Survey on Working Time and <lb/>Work-Life Balance (ESWT), surveying more than 21 000 firms with 10 or more employees in 21 European <lb/>countries, makes it possible to assess part-time work on the firm level in all its particulars (e.g., Anxo et <lb/>al., 2007b). Apart from the proportion of employees who work part-time, another important facet of part-<lb/>time work is the notion of reversibility. Authors often estimate whether firms provide the possibility to <lb/></body>

			<body>reverse a temporary part-time job to a full-time job. Reversibility depicts the quality of part-time work with <lb/>respect to reconciliation of work and family life. This indicator is used by several studies analysing part-<lb/>time work in firms; see, for instance, Anxo et al. (2007b), Flüter-Hoffmann and Solbig (2003), Klammer <lb/>and Letablier (2007) and Riedmann et al. (2006). Other forms of flexible working-time arrangements that <lb/>should be assessed include the option to vary the start and end of daily work, to accumulate hours, to use <lb/>accumulated hours for full days off, and to use accumulated hours for longer periods of leave. This <lb/>selection of flexible time schemes is used in analyses of family-friendly policies at the firm level by <lb/>authors such as Den Dulk (2001), Evans (2002), Hurley (2006) and Pärnänen et al. (2007). The use of <lb/>flexible working arrangements to assess the level of reconciliation needs to be treated with care, as other <lb/>studies report that companies do not necessarily provide the same type of family-friendly working <lb/>measures, as certain arrangements depend on the structure of the firms (Chung et al., 2007). <lb/>164. <lb/>While leave arrangements have been discussed in Chapter 5.1, in a workplace context it is <lb/>important whether the organisational culture in the workplace encourages or discourages employees from <lb/>taking parental leave. The different or additional leave options provided by employers reveal attitudes and <lb/>barriers in the workplace. Fathers might face negative attitudes towards taking paternity leave. Conversely, <lb/>employers face difficulties managing parental leave absences. Hence, in order to assess a firm&apos;s flexibility <lb/>with regard to parental leave, fathers&apos; take-up rates need to be considered, as does the overall prevalence of <lb/>leave take-up. Besides Anxo et al. (2007a), Gornick and Hegewisch (2008) also refer to parental leave at <lb/>the firm level. The take-up of leave is often used to assess parental leave systems – either at the state level <lb/>or at the firm level. Take-up is affected by factors that influence the way parental leave operates in firms, <lb/>including the gender division of labour, access to complementary policy measures, and opportunities for <lb/>reduced hours. <lb/>165. <lb/>Although childcare arrangements have been discussed in a preceding chapter (see Chapter 5.2), <lb/>employers&apos; provision of workplace nurseries or financial assistance indicates whether firms take an <lb/>approach of lightening the childcare burden, or an approach enabling employees to adjust their working <lb/>time, or both. Even today, very few firms provide employees with childcare support. In Europe, a small <lb/>number of companies provide a variety of such services. The literature assumes that policies at the firm <lb/>level are clustered, in that companies seem to combine childcare arrangements and leave arrangements <lb/>(Anxo et al., 2007a). The provision of daycare by employers is also examined by Den Dulk (2001), <lb/>Plantenga and Remery (2005) and Fagan (2003). <lb/>166. <lb/>Other supportive arrangements have been subjected to almost no systematic cross-country <lb/>analysis. However, a survey has been conducted of firms that provide work-family management training or <lb/>research on employees&apos; needs in Europe. It found that in the Netherlands, for example, only a small <lb/>proportion of organisations have begun using an investigative method to establish employees&apos; needs for <lb/>certain arrangements, since work-family policies are widely covered in the media and by policy makers <lb/>(Den Dulk, 2001). Thus, employees are already well-informed. <lb/>167. <lb/>There are various sources available for indicators on workplace practices on the national level. <lb/>These indicators are included in studies of the OECD countries (see, e.g., Evans, 2001) and are planned <lb/>and to some extent already included in the OECD Family Database (e.g., indicator of employment patterns <lb/>of couple families). For some of these indicators, see Chapter 4 on parental labour market outcomes. <lb/>Comparative data on workplace practices on the firm level, however, are rare. They are found in sources <lb/>such as the Establishment Survey on Working Time (ESWT), which allows for the analysis of family-<lb/>friendly arrangements in Europe. Data on OECD countries outside Europe are even more difficult to come <lb/>by. <lb/></body>

			<body>8.2 <lb/>Selection of Indicators <lb/>168. <lb/>For a core assessment of a country&apos;s family policy, we suggest using indicators on the firm level <lb/>only. In the following, indicators of workplace practices are described briefly. Looking over the indicators, <lb/>it will become obvious that they are the result of voluntary regulations or practices on the firm level (such <lb/>as the prevalence of leave take-up). <lb/>Box 10. Indicators for core assessment: policies on the employer/ firm level <lb/>•  Flexible working-time arrangements <lb/> •  Rationale for introducing part-time work <lb/> •  Reversibility of part-time work <lb/> •  Proportion of firms with males on parental leave <lb/> •  Prevalence of leave take-up <lb/> •  Proportion of firms providing daycare<lb/>169. <lb/>As stated above, part-time work is, in principle, the most common flexible working-time <lb/>arrangement. Yet part-time work is not the only form of flexible working time; hence other indicators on <lb/>flexible working-time arrangements, such as possibilities to vary the start and end of the working day, to <lb/>accumulate hours, to use accumulated hours for a day off, and to use accumulated hours for longer leaves, <lb/>should be assessed as well. 14 <lb/>170. <lb/>In Europe, part-time work seems to be a good example of a practice that results from combining <lb/>labour law and collective agreements at the firm level. The Part-Time Directive (97/81/EC) developed by <lb/>the European Commission gives some support for a right to part-time work in its member states. At the <lb/>firm level, employers are requested to consider (a) requests by workers to transfer from full-time to <lb/>part-time work as the latter becomes available in the firm, and (b) requests by workers to transfer from <lb/>part-time to full-time work or to increase their working hours should the opportunity arise (European <lb/>Commission, 1998). Reasons for introducing part-time work may vary across firms. For many employees, <lb/>part-time work is not regarded as a permanent status but rather as a transitory phase. The ESWT survey <lb/>asks questions regarding the rationale for introducing part-time work in a firm, and results show that <lb/>although companies in some countries (e.g., Germany) are obliged by law to offer their employees <lb/>adequate part-time work upon request, the managers of many firms regard such transitions as difficult <lb/>(Riedmann et al., 2006). About one-third of the managers questioned introduced part-time work mainly in <lb/>response to the firm&apos;s needs rather than in response to employees&apos; wishes (Anxo et al., 2007b). The <lb/>indicator on the rationale for introducing part-time work in a firm approximates the right to request <lb/>part-time work at the firm level. It shows whether part-time work is introduced in a company for economic <lb/>or organisational reasons, or in response to employees&apos; requests. It is particularly difficult for companies to <lb/>provide employees the option to switch at will, as stated in the Part-Time Directive of the European Union, <lb/>especially from full-time to part-time work. This reversibility of part-time employment is a major issue for <lb/>the quality of part-time work. Thus we suggest adding an indicator to reflect the notion of reversibility at <lb/>the firm level. This indicator describes the proportion of establishments offering full reversibility between <lb/>part-time and full-time work. The majority of firms with part-timers prefer to switch employees from <lb/>full-time to part-time work, and often do so quickly, whereas they have difficulties with the reverse process <lb/>(Riedmann et al., 2006). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">14 <lb/>For an extensive assessment of family policy, the organisational methods of part-time work for country groups might <lb/>be helpful. Nevertheless there are no country data available on this. There is only information in country groups, such <lb/>as Scandinavia, Western Europe, the UK, the Mediterranean countries, and central Europe. Firms offer employees four <lb/>possibilities to work part-time: they can work a set number of fixed hours every day, a set number of hours over other <lb/>fixed periods, flexible hours on demand, or other forms (see Riedmann et al. 2006). <lb/></note>

			<body>171. <lb/>Leave arrangements initiated at the firm level are less frequent than leave decisions mandated by <lb/>law. Nonetheless, we consider two indicators in this context to be valuable for family policy assessment: <lb/>first, an indicator covering the proportion of firms with male employees on parental leave and the <lb/>respective take-up of leave for males. This indicator enables us to identify countries where fathers might <lb/>face negative attitudes or other barriers that could prevent them from taking up parental leave. A second <lb/>leave-related indicator is the prevalence of leave take-up among women and men. With regard to the <lb/>gender division of parental leave, it is helpful to describe the overall acceptance of extended leave <lb/>provision. <lb/>172. <lb/>An indicator that clearly belongs at the firm level is the childcare arrangements of firms. The <lb/>indicator depicting employer provision of daycare compares firms with employees on leave and firms with <lb/>no employees on leave. It does not necessarily hold that firms with leave arrangements are more likely to <lb/>provide daycare, as some countries differ in the state provision of childcare and leave arrangements. <lb/>8.3 <lb/>Assessment of Country Differences <lb/>173. <lb/>As in previous sections of this report, we now briefly discuss OECD and EU averages of the <lb/>indicators used in this chapter. Table 12 presents an overview of the indicators for all countries. Indicators <lb/>related to policies on the employer level are scarce for the OECD countries outside Europe. In fact, all <lb/>indicators had to be taken from European sources. This lack of non-European data is also the reason why <lb/>the OECD and EU averages do not differ (significantly). <lb/>174. <lb/>First, Table 12 reports indicators related to flexible working-time arrangements. Regarding <lb/>these different possibilities, the following patterns can be noted for Europe. The possibility to vary the <lb/>start and end of the working day is widely used among the members of the EU-21, followed by the <lb/>possibility to use accumulated hours for longer leave periods. The former possibility is provided on <lb/>average by 14.8% of firms in Europe, and the latter by 12.4%. The variation in the start and end of the <lb/>working day is used mostly in Ireland (25% of firms) and Spain (23% of firms), whereas Scandinavian <lb/>firms prefer to offer their employees the option to accumulate hours for longer leaves, i.e., Denmark (25%) <lb/>and Sweden (27%). The possibility to use accumulated hours for full days off is provided by an average <lb/>of 12.0% firms. The option least-used by European firms is the possibility to accumulate hours but not <lb/>in order to take full days off; here, on average, only 7.1% of firms offer this option as a flexible working <lb/>time arrangement. <lb/>175. <lb/>The indicators describing the rationale for introducing part-time work in firms approximate <lb/>the right, provided at the firm level, to request a switch from full-time to part-time work. Here, for the most <lb/>part firms report that employees switch to part-time work mainly on employee wishes (on average <lb/>37.9%). This is for instance the case for firms in Scandinavian countries, i.e., 50% in Denmark. The reason <lb/> &quot; mainly needs of establishment &quot; is high in Cyprus (60%) and in Poland (65%). This rationale averages <lb/>34.3% among the members of the EU-21. Firms that reported establishment needs and employee wishes <lb/>being of equal importance in switches to part-time work make up 20.8% of all firms in Europe. <lb/>176. <lb/>Countries should assess not only the possibility of part-time work at the firm level, but also the <lb/>notion of reversibility. The indicator reporting reversibility indicates the proportion of firms per country <lb/>where employees can switch from part-time to full-time. On average 9% of firms that allow their <lb/>employees to switch from full-time to part-time also provide the possibility to switch back to full-time <lb/>employment. The highest proportion of firms providing reversibility can be found in Sweden (17%), in <lb/>Austria (16%), in France (16%) and in the UK (16%). <lb/>177. <lb/>Leave arrangements provided at the firm level are less frequent than at state level. The indicators <lb/>firms with males on parental leave and prevalence of leave take-up allow parental leave to be assessed <lb/></body>

			<body>at the firm level. In Europe, 31.6% of establishments allow male employees to go on leave. The <lb/>Scandinavian countries report the highest proportion of firms offering leave periods to male employees <lb/>among all firms with employees on parental leave in past three years, for example, Finland (59%) and <lb/>Sweden (69%). The prevalence of leave take-up amounts to an average of 54.7% of firms. Sweden (89%) <lb/>and Finland (80%) again state the highest prevalence of leave. However, a preferable situation for <lb/>employees with regard to leave take-up is not found in all countries. In Spain, for instance, only 25% of <lb/>firms report a prevalence of leave. <lb/>178. <lb/>Finally, we discuss the childcare arrangements of firms. The proportion of firms offering <lb/>childcare arrangements as an additional form of support is reported separately according to the number of <lb/>employees on leave. On average, 6.9% of firms providing childcare arrangements have no employees on <lb/>leave, whereas 8.1% of firms offering childcare as an additional support do have employees on leave. The <lb/>provision of such services at a company level is significantly more extensive in some countries, i.e., the <lb/>Netherlands (41% of firms with employees on leave), Latvia (22%) and the UK (17%) than in other <lb/>countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 9. GOVERNMENT ASSESSMENT <lb/>179. <lb/>For governments that want to assess their family policies, it is important to have some guidance <lb/>as to which context and outcome indicators on the one hand and which indicators on policy measures on <lb/>the other hand should be analysed. It is the purpose of this chapter to demonstrate which indicators and <lb/>which measures should be considered when assessing the policy aims discussed here: gender equality, <lb/>child wellbeing and balancing work and family life. <lb/>180. <lb/>In order for countries to assess their national family policies, it is important not only for them to <lb/>interpret policies according to relevant context and outcome criteria, but also for them to be able to assess <lb/>their position relative to other countries. For this purpose, national scorecards have been developed. In <lb/>principle they can be constructed for all countries. We demonstrate the use and construction of these <lb/>scorecards for three countries: Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany. These are merely examples <lb/>that demonstrate the principles of our scorecards. <lb/>181. <lb/>The scorecards cover most of the core indicators discussed earlier in the report and consist of a <lb/>selection of what are considered to be the most relevant context, outcome and policy indicators for the <lb/>achievement of any of the three policy goals: gender equality, child wellbeing and balancing work and <lb/>family life. <lb/>182. <lb/>Each policy indicator in the scorecards is chosen according to its importance for achieving the <lb/>policy goal, whereas context and outcome indicators are chosen based on how well they illustrate the <lb/>country context and state of the policy goal. Policy measure, context and outcome indicators might be part <lb/>of more than one policy goal; for example, the provision of early childhood education and care might serve <lb/>all three purposes of achieving gender equality, promoting child wellbeing, and maintaining a balance <lb/>between work and family life. In most cases, however, indicators have either a direct or an indirect <lb/>relationship with policy goals. <lb/>183. <lb/>In the scorecards, each state can assess the relative value of its national indicators in two graphs. <lb/>The first graph presents the relative values of the national indicators on context and outcome dimensions; <lb/>the second graph presents the relative values of the family policy indicators. For each indicator, its <lb/>assumed relationship with one of our three overall policy goals has been indicated by a capital letter: G for <lb/>gender equality, C for child wellbeing and B for balancing work and family life. <lb/>184. <lb/>It is of great importance to keep in mind that the choice of indicators does not reflect the stance <lb/>that there is a direct statistical causal relationship between context, policy measures and outcomes. This <lb/>would require much more extensive statistical testing. The scorecards can only give a first indication as to <lb/>which indicators are important to take into consideration when assessing policy settings. <lb/>185. <lb/>Moreover, we would like to emphasise that the scorecards are merely first attempts at a family <lb/>policy assessment. They should stimulate the discussion. Furthermore, they are open for improvement. <lb/>Such improvements can take place in the methodology, in the data quality, in the availability of data to <lb/>construct the indicators, and in the links between policy aims and indicators. Apart from this, more <lb/>indicators could be added. <lb/></body>

			<body>9.1 <lb/>Potential Linkages between Policy Aims, Context and Outcome Indicators and Policy Measures <lb/>186. <lb/>As described in Chapter 3.2, agreeing and then defining the aims of family policy is a major <lb/>precondition for family policy assessment. These aims establish the foundation for the assessment and <lb/>determine what direction it will take. In some cases, the results of the assessment will differ depending on <lb/>which guiding aims are chosen; in others, they will not. However, since both the list of indicators and the <lb/>list of policy measures are subject to change, the proposed groupings may change as well. What is <lb/>presented here should be regarded as suggestions, open for discussion and improvement. In the end, only <lb/>the extent to which such groupings are being used will demonstrate whether they were appropriate and <lb/>useful for government assessment. <lb/>9.2 <lb/>Policy Aim: Child Wellbeing <lb/>187. <lb/>If governments want to assess whether the aim of ensuring child wellbeing has been achieved in <lb/>their countries, a first set of context indicators in the short run and outcome measures in the long run could <lb/>be considered. The following box summarises indicators that refer clearly and directly to the wellbeing of <lb/>the child. Some indicators refer to child wellbeing in a more indirect manner, via the time parents spend <lb/>with their children and via the financial resources available to the family if one or both parents are <lb/>employed. While the use of the first set of indicators is relatively straightforward, the use of the latter more <lb/>indirect set provides an example of the difficulties associated with attempting to link particular indicators <lb/>with even one particular policy aim. On the one hand, parental employment clearly increases the material <lb/>wellbeing of families, leading to a potential increase in the material wellbeing of the children. But on the <lb/>other hand, there is no clear correlation between parental employment and child development or child <lb/>wellbeing. This correlation depends on a set of various factors related to employment, or even other factors <lb/>relating to parents, children and the care situation. The average number of actual working hours, preferred <lb/>hours versus current hours, and the time spent on childcare and daily household chores are important as <lb/>well. But even these objective indicators show no clear picture. Some child development advocates argue <lb/>that what matters is not simply the time parents spend with their children but the quality of that time. <lb/>Others may argue that it is the parents&apos; satisfaction with their work-life balance that matters, and not so <lb/>much the question of employment. Thus, the life satisfaction of parents could be another important <lb/>indicator for child wellbeing. <lb/>Box 11.

			<body>188. <lb/>The linkage between policy measures and the policy aim of child wellbeing is affected by a <lb/>number of direct and more indirect measures. Again, we try to summarise some of the measures relevant to <lb/>child wellbeing that were discussed in Chapter 5. Leave and ECEC measures in particular are directly <lb/>linked to child wellbeing. It is assumed that longer paid leave periods promote child development, because <lb/>they allow parents (in particular mothers) to spend time with their very young children in what is <lb/>considered an important phase for child development. However, from a long-term perspective, a longer <lb/>leave period affects the labour market performance of mothers, and thus might reduce family income, <lb/>which in turn affects the material wellbeing of the child. The linkage with ECEC measures is clearer. In <lb/>particular, measures to increase the quality of ECEC services are of great importance for the wellbeing of <lb/>children. With respect to more indirect measures, it is important that leave periods be paid, and that enough <lb/>(public) funds be allocated to ECEC. These factors may affect the quantity and quality of ECEC services. <lb/>An increase in quantity increases the employment opportunities for both parents, and thus might lead to an <lb/>increase in the material wellbeing of children. Various family benefit measures help to increase the <lb/>financial resources of families, and thus promote the material wellbeing of children. Moreover, special <lb/>benefits for lone parents or families with many children might provide focussed support to groups that are <lb/>known to be at a higher risk of poverty. Finally, policies on the employer/firm level should be considered, <lb/>as they can help to improve the wellbeing of children as well. Flexible working-time arrangements enable <lb/>parents to react in a more flexible way to the needs of their children. <lb/>Box 12.

			<body>9.3 <lb/>Policy Aim: Gender Equality <lb/>189. <lb/>A large number of indicators make it possible to assess the extent to which the aim of gender <lb/>equality has been achieved. These could include aspects of labour market equality and income inequality, <lb/>but also issues of political participation and representation. From a family policy perspective, equal <lb/>representation in the labour market, equal pay and equal sharing of time appear most pertinent. The <lb/>respective indicators can thus be used for an assessment of the aim of gender equality. Differences in <lb/>labour earnings between men and women are reflected in the gender pay gap. There are various indicators <lb/>that measure the gendered structure of the labour market. The gender employment gap captures the overall <lb/>differences between men and women in labour-market participation. Maternal employment rates are more <lb/>directly focussed on the relationship between gender, family and employment. Part-time employment is, in <lb/>many countries, an important means of gaining flexibility to combine work and family. However, a part-<lb/>time working status often entails lower earnings and more limited career opportunities. As part-timers are <lb/>predominantly women, a high share of part-time work not only means higher flexibility but also <lb/>restrictions for women in the labour market. Furthermore, the equal sharing of paid work, as captured by <lb/>labour-market participation rates, does not necessarily mean the equal sharing of unpaid work. Therefore <lb/>gendered information on the time spent on paid work care and household chores is an important indicator <lb/>to assess gender equality. <lb/>Box 13. Context and outcome indicators relevant to gender equality <lb/>Earnings <lb/>• <lb/>Gender wage gap <lb/>Employment <lb/>• <lb/>Gender employment gap <lb/>• <lb/>Maternal employment rates <lb/>• <lb/>Part-time employment rates by gender <lb/>• <lb/>Full-time employment rates by gender <lb/>Sharing of time <lb/>• <lb/>Time used for work, care and daily household chores <lb/>* Not yet available in the OECD Family Database. <lb/>190. <lb/>As with the policy aim of child wellbeing, there are a large number of policy measures that affect <lb/>the aim of gender equality. There is also substantial overlap among policies – that is, policies that affect <lb/>both aims. For instance, policies directed at the maternal labour market position and the sharing of unpaid <lb/>work also have an impact on child wellbeing (higher resources, less time for childcare). It is also true that <lb/>most family policies will have some impact on gender equality – some more directly, others less directly. <lb/>Thus, measures from all four policy areas (leave schemes, family benefits, early childhood education and <lb/>care, policies on the employer/firm level) are regarded as important for achieving the aim of gender <lb/>equality. A direct link can be assumed between policies such as leave schemes that affect maternal and <lb/>paternal labour market positions (in particular the relationship of maternal to paternal leave) and the <lb/>reversibility of part-time work to full-time work. Furthermore, a gender-neutral tax-benefit system is <lb/>expected to positively influence the equal division of labour within households. Indirectly, not only will the <lb/>relation of maternal to paternal leave affect gender equality, but also the design of leave policies in broader <lb/>terms. The availability of formal childcare increases opportunities for the labour-market participation of <lb/>care providers. Therefore, policies such as formal entitlement to daycare, take-up rates of daycare and <lb/>educational services, the share of children in full-time provision, opening hours, and ECEC expenditure are <lb/>included. It should be kept in mind that equal labour-market participation rates do not necessarily imply an <lb/>equal position on the labour market (e.g., due to the gender pay gap). The same constraint may apply to <lb/>policies at the employer/firm level that increase flexibility in the workplace. <lb/></body>

These <lb/>are set out in Box 15. It is not always easy to establish whether these are outcome or context indicators; for <lb/>example, high female employment rates may be the result of a preference for having fewer children or, <lb/>conversely, high labour force participation may cause women to prefer having fewer children. <lb/>Nevertheless, the indicators can be used for a better understanding of which factors are relevant in a <lb/>national assessment. Among the demographic indicators proposed to have direct relevance for the <lb/>understanding of the balance between work and family life, fertility rates and women&apos;s average age at first <lb/>birth should be considered, as they are likely to be influenced by problems combining work and family life. <lb/>The average household size, the proportion of households without children, as well as the difference <lb/>between the actual and ideal number of children may also be indicative of whether families succeed in <lb/>balancing work and family life. The reasons why women have not fulfilled their childbearing desires can <lb/>explain the extent to which these reasons are work-related. <lb/>192. <lb/>Among the employment indicators, one of the most important context and outcome indicators is <lb/>how many mothers are in employment, as this indicates whether it is possible to combine motherhood and <lb/>paid labour. Average working hours may also be indicative of how pressured men and women feel. We <lb/>assume that part-time employment rates for men and women indicate how much difficulty parents face <lb/>combining work and family life, but this may also represent a strategy for participating in the labour <lb/>market while children are small or it may be an (undesired) solution to problems balancing work and <lb/>family life. How men and women distribute the household chores between them may also indicate the <lb/>extent to which women are more burdened with these tasks and therefore find it difficult to participate in <lb/>paid labour. <lb/></body>

			<body>193. <lb/>Of the more indirect indicators, life satisfaction may reveal the difficulties men and women have <lb/>combining work and family life – if we accept this as part of general life satisfaction. The indicator of lone <lb/>parent households is relevant, albeit indirectly, for understanding in how many households the sole <lb/>breadwinner also bears sole responsibility for the family and household chores. <lb/>Box 15. Context and outcome indicators relevant to balancing work and family life <lb/>Directly related to balancing work and family life <lb/>Demography <lb/>• <lb/>Fertility rate <lb/>• <lb/>Women&apos;s average age at first birth <lb/>• <lb/>Average household size <lb/>• <lb/>Proportion of households with no children <lb/>• <lb/>Childbearing preferences of childless women <lb/>• <lb/>Mean actual and ideal number of children <lb/>• <lb/>Reason for not fulfilling stated childbearing desires (lack of balance between work and family life) <lb/>Employment <lb/>• <lb/>Maternal employment rates <lb/>• <lb/>Average number of actual working hours <lb/>• <lb/>Time used for work, care and daily household chores* <lb/>Indirectly relevant <lb/>• <lb/>Lone-parent households <lb/>• <lb/>Life satisfaction <lb/>* Not yet available in the OECD Family Database. <lb/>194. <lb/>Policy measures of direct relevance that should be included in an assessment of the policy goal of <lb/>balancing work and family life include measures on leave, ECEC, taxes and employment. These are <lb/>outlined in Box 16. <lb/>195. <lb/>We assume that the public investment in leave and ECEC services, represented by the social <lb/>expenditure levels in these two policy fields, will reflect the possibility for parents to choose between <lb/>looking after the child at home or having the child looked after in formal daycare. A combination of high <lb/>expenditure in both policy fields would very crudely indicate better possibilities to combine work and <lb/>family life (not taking into account institutional variation in leave and ECEC arrangements across <lb/>countries). Likewise, the length of leave may indicate whether it is possible to take time off work to look <lb/>after the child, but this would preferably exist in combination with high enrolment rates and formal <lb/>entitlement to ECEC in order to provide a choice between work and childcare. The compensation rates <lb/>provided by leave schemes as well as the effective amount of leave provided indicate how realistic it is for <lb/>men and women to actually take the leave, and in cases where the compensation rate is low, the rates also <lb/>indirectly indicate the pressure on the woman to take the majority of the leave, since she is normally the <lb/>one who earns lower wages. Finally, the gender equality index also portrays the possible gender imbalance <lb/>in the design of the leave schemes and how this may affect women&apos;s opportunities for balancing work and <lb/>family life. <lb/>196. <lb/>Payments for ECEC, opening hours, and the possibility to use full-time services may also <lb/>influence parents&apos; decisions to make use of these services and thus whether it is feasible to combine work <lb/>and family life. <lb/>197. <lb/>In regard to indicators on employment, the statutory regulation of the maximum number of <lb/>working hours as well as the average number of actual working hours are important for understanding how <lb/>much time work takes up and whether this leaves time for tending to a family, whereas existing problems <lb/></body>

			<body>balancing work and family life may be captured in the indicator current vs. preferred working hours of <lb/>parents. <lb/>198. <lb/>Parents may also consider the quality of the services, reported as child:staff ratios and staff <lb/>training levels, when deciding whether and how much they want to use services. <lb/>199. <lb/>Parents may also consider the quality of services, reported as child:staff ratios and staff training <lb/>levels, when deciding whether and how much they want to use services, but since these indicators relate to <lb/>the child&apos;s outcome from participating in ECEC services, they are treated as indirect indicators under this <lb/>policy aim. <lb/>200. <lb/>Finally, various family benefit indicators may be included as indirect indicators of whether men <lb/>and women can balance work and family life, insofar as they indicate the general support available to <lb/>families and the degree to which parents need to supplement their income from paid labour. <lb/>Box 16.

			<body>9.5 <lb/>Description of Scorecards <lb/>201. <lb/>Scorecards have been constructed for three countries – Denmark, Germany, and the UK – in <lb/>order to illustrate how a comparable synthesis of country context, policy measures and outcome indicators <lb/>can be presented. In principle, scorecards for all countries could be made in the same manner. <lb/>202. <lb/>For each country we present two figures. The first provides an overview of outcome and context <lb/>indicators (see Chapter 4) that are directly related to the policy aims of child wellbeing, gender equality <lb/>and balancing work and family life. The second contains information on indicators that describe the design <lb/>of family policy measures (see Chapter 5). Both figures follow the same style in organising the data. The <lb/>basic idea is to present a country&apos;s value for a given indicator in relation to the indicator&apos;s distribution <lb/>across all countries. Therefore, for each indicator the figures contain the mean, minimum and maximum <lb/>values. This allows for a quick and transparent assessment of a country&apos;s position in comparison to other <lb/>countries. <lb/>203. <lb/>All indicators have been transformed into z-scores (i.e., the deviation of a value from the mean <lb/>divided by the standard deviation). The mean of a z-standardised variable is zero; one unit equals the <lb/>standard variation of this variable. Hence, the scale is the same for all indicators and they can be compared <lb/>directly. To provide a better orientation, all figures include separating lines at +1/2 and -1/2 standard <lb/>deviations. Values falling between these two lines can be regarded as close to the mean of the variable. The <lb/>same logic has already been used in earlier chapters to differentiate between three levels for each indicator <lb/>(&gt;, O, &lt;). It is relatively unproblematic to update the z-scores, as they are simple calculations of raw <lb/>indicators based on the data available from the OECD database. <lb/>204. <lb/>The labels in the figures on family policy indicators contain the additional letters C, B and G. <lb/>These letters pick up the discussion in Section 6.1 of the link between family policy measures and policy <lb/>aims. For instance, C signifies that the respective indicator is directly or indirectly related to the aim of <lb/>child wellbeing (B=balancing work and family life, G=gender equality). However, many indicators are <lb/>directly related to all three policy aims or might be related to an additional policy aim at least indirectly. <lb/>Therefore, the letters are meant as a tool to read the figure, but they do not suggest that a proper evaluation <lb/>has established a causal relationship between a policy measure and an outcome. <lb/>205. <lb/>Two additional caveats should be added. First, the country sample differs from indicator to <lb/>indicator (see the respective tables in Chapters 4 and 5). Therefore, the calculation of the mean, the <lb/>standard deviation, and the minimum and maximum often does not take into account the full sample of 38 <lb/>countries examined in this report. Second, the direction of the indicators differs. A high value does not <lb/>always have to be read as a positive outcome, and a low value can be positive (e.g., a low proportion of <lb/>children in poverty). As the interpretation of a given value sometimes depends on the policy aim or is <lb/>simply a normative question, we have not attempted to produce unidirectional indicators. Hence, if a <lb/>country exhibits the maximum, it just means &quot; highest value &quot; and not necessarily &quot; best performer &quot; . <lb/>206. <lb/>We briefly discuss the example of Denmark to illustrate the contents of the scorecards. The first <lb/>graph is divided into three subsections that contain context and outcome indicators for the three policy <lb/>aims: child wellbeing, balancing work and family life and gender equality. Denmark scores low in most <lb/>indicators of child wellbeing (values below the average over all countries for which an indicator is <lb/>available). However, with the exception of the PISA scores, which are almost average, a low share can be <lb/>interpreted in a positive way. The share of young men and women not in education and the child poverty <lb/>rate there are the lowest among all countries. The share of children with low birth weight is also well <lb/>below the average. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 <lb/></note>

			<page>73 <lb/></page>

			<body>207. <lb/>Regarding the indicators that describe the context and outcomes in the field of balancing work <lb/>and family life, we also have to take into account the direction of the indicators. Denmark scores above-<lb/>average with regard to maternal employment rates, the part-time employment rate of men, the fertility rate, <lb/>and the share of households with no children, and the difference between the actual and ideal number of <lb/>children also tends to be high. The average household size is below average. However, the share of people <lb/>who state that they do not have children because of difficulties combining work and family life or due to <lb/>financial problems is low. The share of childless women who do not desire to have children (childbearing <lb/>preferences), the mean age of women at first birth, and the part-time employment rate of women are at a <lb/>level at or near the average. It is not easy to summarise the results for Denmark under a common heading <lb/>that reflects the complexity involved in assessing the outcomes and the contexts for the aim of balancing <lb/>work and family life. <lb/>208. <lb/>Looking at the aim of gender equality, we find three indicators that have already been used since <lb/>they are also related to the aim of balancing work and family life (part-time employment rates of men and <lb/>women, maternal employment rates). The other two indicators show that the gender wage gap as well as <lb/>the gender employment gap is comparatively low in Denmark. <lb/>209. <lb/>The second graph, which shows the family policy indicators, is divided into six subsections <lb/>(benefits and taxes, expenditure, firm-level policies, working time, child care, parental leave). Denmark <lb/>scores rather high (or at the top) with respect to compensation for parental leave, but lower with respect to <lb/>the length of parental leave. Denmark also scores high in almost all indicators that describe the child-care <lb/>system. In many areas – such as childcare – it is easy to assume that policy measures are related to all three <lb/>policy aims. The enrolment rates in childcare are high. For zero to two-year-olds, they are the highest of all <lb/>countries in our comparison. The share of children in full-time care (as a percentage of all children in care) <lb/>is high. Childcare facilities in Denmark have, on average, long opening hours. On some of the indicators, <lb/>Denmark scores low. First, the child:staff ratio in preschool programmes is low, which can be taken as an <lb/>indicator of the quality of the programmes. The share of public funding is also low (while the overall <lb/>public expenditure on ECEC is high). This example shows clearly that it takes a normative view to <lb/>evaluate whether high or low indicators should be interpreted in a positive or negative manner. <lb/>210. <lb/>Looking at working-time regulations, the scorecard shows a mixed picture for Denmark. The <lb/>statutory maximum is the highest of all OECD and EU countries. However, the collectively agreed average <lb/>working time is well below the average. There are, to varying degrees, possibilities to accumulate hours. A <lb/>comparatively high share of firms offer the option to reverse part-time work. With respect to firm-level <lb/>policies, the share of firms providing daycare is below average; the share of firms with males on parental <lb/>leave is above average. <lb/>211. <lb/>Overall, public expenditure indicators show that Denmark spends a high share of its GDP on <lb/>family policies, in particular on in-kind measures. But expenditure on cash benefits is also above average <lb/>(which includes expenditure on parental leave). Family support via tax breaks seems to play a minor role <lb/>compared to other countries. The family benefit package for a family at the average wage level is slightly <lb/>above average. Benefits for larger families or single parents are not particularly high compared to other <lb/>families. Average tax rates are high, as are the differences between the tax rates for single and dual earners <lb/>(i.e., the rate for dual earners is lower). <lb/>212. <lb/>Although the scorecards are meant as a tool to summarise the detailed information collected in <lb/>earlier chapters, they still provide information on the value of a given indicator, but in a more standardised <lb/>manner, with direct reference to the overall distribution of an indicator (minimum, maximum, average). In <lb/>our view, this allows for a quicker assessment of an overall country profile without assigning an overall <lb/>grade to that country&apos;s family policy, since many of the indicators can be read in different ways (positive <lb/>for one aim, negative for another). <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 10. CONCLUSION <lb/>213. <lb/>This report provides a first attempt at identifying and operationalising relevant indicators for a <lb/>national assessment of family policy. Indicators on contexts, outcomes and policy measures have been <lb/>selected according to a definition of family policy that focuses on families with younger children. The <lb/>indicators have been selected according to their importance and relevance for three overall policy aims: <lb/>child wellbeing, gender equality and balancing work and family life. Based on the indicators selected, <lb/>country-specific scorecards for the assessment of family policy were drawn up. Three national scorecards <lb/>have been presented as examples to illustrate how countries can assess their family policy relative to other <lb/>comparable countries. <lb/>214. <lb/>The indicators chosen for use in this report by no means represent an exhaustive list. They are <lb/>part of an pragmatic approach based on the data presently available. Throughout the report, we have <lb/>commented on the limitations of the available data and which additional data we would like to see <lb/>provided. Much of the data originates from the OECD Family Database, which represents a genuine <lb/>advance in making data comparable and accessible, and in providing an understanding of the cross-country <lb/>differences in family policy design. Still, more accuracy is needed in the overview of expenditure of family <lb/>services and early childhood services. <lb/>215. <lb/>We would also like to see more child-centred indicators oriented where the child is the primary <lb/>unit of observation and analysis. Child-centred data can give a more holistic picture of children&apos;s rights and <lb/>the realities that shape children&apos;s lives. For example, the number of hours worked and time devoted to <lb/>caring by both parents per child, which would suggest how the child might be affected by the amount of <lb/>time that both the mother and father work. Child-centred data would also further understanding of national <lb/>and international differences in combinations of leave and early years daycare. <lb/>216. <lb/>National governments should also consider investing more resources in developing panel data <lb/>sets which allow for the monitoring of child development over time. Examples of such an approach are the <lb/>British &apos;National Child Development Study&apos;, &apos;The British Cohort Study&apos;, and &apos;The Millennium Study&apos;, the <lb/>&apos;German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP)&apos;, from the US &apos;The NICD study&apos;, The Danish Longitudinal <lb/>Survey of Children, and the recently started French &quot; Etude Longitudinale Française depuis l&apos;Enfance &quot; . <lb/>217. <lb/>Overall, the available data on the various leave schemes is not sufficient for a full understanding <lb/>of the national differences, for example, for comprehending how parents combine various forms of <lb/>parental leave and what compensation is available for them across different income groupings and <lb/>employment sectors. Moreover, existing indicators mainly focus on the state agencies responsible for <lb/>family policies, while those for policies on the employer/firm level are sparse. Yet the firm level is <lb/>important, in particular to balancing work and family life. More and better data on the firm level are <lb/>needed for a cross-country evaluation on this level. This study has been based on comparable national data, <lb/>but regional data would be useful to understand the national variation, which can be substantial in some <lb/>countries. Apart from this, the indicators we selected are mainly objective measures; nevertheless, <lb/>subjective indicators are important as well. Further work in the creation of new comparable indicators <lb/>should take this into account. <lb/>218. <lb/>The choice of indicators has, as mentioned, been pragmatic and policy-driven. We have not <lb/>attempted to investigate whether indicators are directly related to policy aims. Since the policy aims are <lb/></body>

			<body>rather broad, most indicators can be used to explain more than one policy aim. It has not been the purpose <lb/>of this report to establish whether there is a linear or other relationship between indicators and policy aims, <lb/>or to test the level at which an indicator has a negative vs. positive relationship to a policy goal. It is left to <lb/>future investigation to establish such relationships. However, we hope that this report will contribute to <lb/>more depth in the discussion about how to best assess family policy. It is an assessment tool makes use of <lb/>the OECD Family Database which reflects the value of this unique data source for cross-country <lb/>comparisons in the field of family policy. <lb/></body>

There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek <lb/>Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus <lb/>(TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of the United Nations, <lb/>Turkey will maintain its position concerning the &quot; Cyprus issue &quot; . Footnote by all the European <lb/>Union member states of the OECD and the European Commission: The Republic of Cyprus is <lb/>recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information <lb/>in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic <lb/>of Cyprus. <lb/>• Households with no children<lb/>Definition: Households with no children, as a proportion of all households. <lb/>Table 2 <lb/>• Statutory maximum:<lb/>Definition: Some European countries set their maximum weekly hours at the 48 hours specified <lb/>in the EU working-time directive. Yet, some European countries also set a limit of about 40 <lb/>hours, and working-time flexibility schemes allow weekly hours to vary around an average over a <lb/>reference period. For example, in Austria, weekly hours may be varied up to a maximum of 50 <lb/>over a reference period, if an average 40-hour week is maintained (see OECD, 2007). <lb/>Table 5 <lb/>• Childbearing preferences<lb/>Definition: Childless women aged 15-39 with no preferences for children <lb/></body>

Although a <lb/>percentage of salary will in most cases be superior to a percentage of the minimum wage (or in <lb/>the Nordic countries, to the wage of an unskilled worker), the calculation of the replacement <lb/>wage in this table treats both sources in the same way, that is, 50% of the minimum wage and <lb/>50% of salary receive an equal weighting. <lb/>• Gender equality index<lb/>Definition: Measure of countries&apos; policies on a fifteen-point scale, with nine possible points for <lb/>the distribution of leave, five possible points for the level of wage replacement during leave, and <lb/>one possible point (positive or negative) for policy incentives that encourage men to take or not <lb/>take the leave available. <lb/>Table 7 <lb/>• Public expenditure ECEC<lb/>Definition: Public expenditure on childcare and pre-primary education services, percentage of <lb/>GDP. <lb/>Table 8 <lb/>• Average opening hours<lb/>Definition: Average opening hours of ECEC <lb/>• Training of staff<lb/>Definition: 50% of staff in accredited early education services tertiary educated with relevant <lb/>qualifications. <lb/>Note: Data for UK refers to England only. <lb/></body>
