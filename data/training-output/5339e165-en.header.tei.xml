	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IMPACT ASSESSMENT:<lb/> ISSUES, METHODS AND CHALLENGES<lb/> The Research Impact Assessment (RIA) is expected to increase the efficiency with which public funds are<lb/> used, and to improve more broadly the functioning of the research and innovation system and its contribution<lb/> to address a wide range of socio-economic and environmental issues. Both standard economic approaches,<lb/> which aim to estimate the economic benefits of research investments, and case-study approaches, which aim<lb/> to analyse the processes of impact generation, have been applied to agricultural research in practice.<lb/> Standard economic approaches generally focus on public research as information on private efforts in<lb/> agricultural research is limited, and on economic impacts such as productivity growth. Case studies provide<lb/> richer information, through a narrative, and highlight the complex relationships among the various variables,<lb/> events and actors, but it is difficult to standardise results and scale them up. The challenge for RIA is to take<lb/> into account broader impacts that go beyond science and economic impacts, and to improve knowledge on<lb/> impact-generating mechanisms. This has become more difficult as agricultural research and innovation<lb/> systems are increasingly open and complex, and changing quickly. Observation of practices applied to<lb/> agricultural research in five selected organisations confirms the difference found in RIA between academic<lb/> research and in practice. In both, the assessment systems pursue the same objectives: 1) Learning: enhance<lb/> the know-how to produce an environment conducive to socio-economic impact; 2) Capacity building: spread<lb/> the culture of socio-economic impact to its researchers; and 3) Reporting to stakeholders: from accountability<lb/> purposes to advocacy targeted to various audiences. The accountability objective, including estimating returns<lb/> on the financial investment, poses complex challenges and is in tension with the learning and capacity building<lb/> objectives. The future of RIA will depend on the capacity to improve estimation methods and gather quality<lb/> information (which also takes into account non-economic impacts) and the sharing of good practices.<lb/></div>
