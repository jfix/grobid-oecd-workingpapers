			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper is part of the joint project between the Directorate General for Migration and Home Affairs <lb/>of the European Commission and the OECD&apos;s Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs on <lb/> &quot; Review of Labour Migration Policy in Europe &quot; . <lb/>This document has been produced with the financial assistance of the European Union. The views <lb/>expressed herein can in no way be taken to reflect the official opinion of the European Union. <lb/>Grant: HOME/2013/EIFX/CA/002 / 30-CE-0615920/00-38 (DI130895) <lb/>A previous version of this paper was presented and discussed at the OECD Working Party on <lb/>Migration in June 2015.The paper investigates the preferences and post-graduation mobility behaviour of <lb/>international students, focusing on how the EU could succeed in attracting and keeping highly educated <lb/>talent from across the globe. Providing their skills to European labour markets, graduates from outside the <lb/>EU have a potential to enrich the supply of high-skilled labour. Seen as the 28 EU countries still constitute <lb/>the most attractive destination area for studying abroad, the paper examines different calculation methods <lb/>in order to generate stay rates for over 170 countries of origin. <lb/>Empirical results indicate that for the EU as a whole, aggregate stay rates from stayers from all non-<lb/>EU source countries lie within a range of 16.4% and 29.1%. They are also typically very low among <lb/>students from other OECD countries, and much higher for students from less developed or politically less <lb/>stable countries. The paper concludes by recommending a catalogue of measures to boost the EU&apos;s <lb/>attractiveness, and to increase stay rates. Proposed policy measures draw on a smooth labour market <lb/>integration of international graduates, as well as on cultivating strong points of the European countries, <lb/>such as: political stability and participation possibilities, reliable institutions and governance structure, as <lb/>well as an innovative and competitive environment. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 INTRODUCTION -ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRACTING AND KEEPING TALENT <lb/>1. <lb/>European economies have always been subject to change over time. Some changes were of a <lb/>short-term nature and occurred as negative shocks, sending economies into recession. Other changes <lb/>manifested themselves as medium-or long-term trends. An important evolution, belonging to the second <lb/>category, is the increasing importance of knowledge-based processes in all developed economies. The <lb/>input factor &apos;knowledge&apos;, human capital, contributes more and more to productivity in European <lb/>economies. <lb/>2. <lb/>Although EU member states experienced rather heterogeneous economic development since the <lb/>early 2000s, there remains one striking similarity: the relative share of tertiary educated individuals <lb/>employed in science and technology surged between 2002 and 2012. This development is primarily driven <lb/>by a rising absolute number of highly skilled individuals in these occupations. Consequently, European <lb/>economies now rely more than ever on the supply of high skilled labour. <lb/>Figure 1. Tertiary educated employees in science and technology as percentage of the total active <lb/>population, 2012 and 2002. <lb/>Source: Eurostat, own representation <lb/>Note: <lb/>EU 27 refers to all current members but Croatia. <lb/>1 Footnote by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to «Cyprus» relates to the southern part of the Island. <lb/>There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island.

			<body>3. <lb/>This dependence is likely to increase further as the evolution of knowledge-based economies <lb/>proceeds. To meet this rising demand, and to foster innovativeness, EU economies have to invest in the <lb/>formation of human capital -the &apos;brains&apos; of the future labour force. <lb/>4. <lb/>Demographic constraints however, already looming at the horizon, will limit the maximal <lb/>possible supply of &apos;brains&apos; the EU will be able to generate, even with increases in the share of youth who <lb/>are tertiary-educated. To ensure that knowledge-fuelled EU economies will not suffer a fuel shortage in the <lb/>near future, some short-acting measures might be required. <lb/> &quot; I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow. &quot; <lb/>Woodrow T. Wilson, 28 th president of the USA, 1856-1924 <lb/>5. <lb/>In this spirit, attracting third country workers to the EU is one potential approach. But what if <lb/>these migration streams are too small, or there still remains a qualification mismatch? To prevent this <lb/>issue, initiatives have been launched, such as the EU Blue Card, designed specifically to attract high-<lb/>skilled labour. However, resulting inflows might still be insufficient. <lb/>6. <lb/>Recent trends, i.e. the jump in the number of asylum seekers from 261 thousand in 2010 to 628 <lb/>thousand <lb/>in <lb/>2014 <lb/>2 <lb/>, indicate that actual inflows into the EU could mitigate the demographic constraint, depending on whether <lb/>the majority of these migrants stay temporarily or permanently. In any case, the distribution of these new <lb/>immigrants across European member states is not proportional to their labour market size. At the same <lb/>time, educational background and occupational skill sets of these new arrivals, already acquired abroad, are <lb/>heterogeneous. <lb/>7. <lb/>Aside from workers who completed education and vocational training abroad there is another <lb/>group of temporary migrants, namely international students. Their number reached in 2012 an all-time high <lb/>of almost 1.5 million enrolled students 3 , indicating that the EU remains one of the main destinations for <lb/>studying abroad (see Figure A. 1in the appendix). <lb/>8. <lb/>In 2012, 500 thousand of the 1.46 million of international students in the EU were students <lb/>from another EU country. Hence, almost two-thirds of all international students in the EU came from <lb/>countries outside the EU -they constitute potentially a substantial pool of well-educated and highly-skilled <lb/>future workers. Beyond their formal qualifications they also acquired additional cultural and social capital <lb/>as well as language skills during their years of study in the EU. All these aspects speak in favour of a <lb/>smooth integration into an EU labour market. Moreover, by their initial choice of studying in the EU they <lb/>already demonstrated that the EU has a certain appeal on them. <lb/>9. <lb/>Whereas all major destinations hosted in 2012 distinctly more internationally mobile students <lb/>than five years ago, the three major destinations attracted slightly smaller shares (Figure 2). Compared to <lb/>2007, students gravitated more frequently towards the Russian Federation and China. A noteworthy shift in <lb/>2 <lb/>Figures are rounded, extracted from Eurostat tables on &apos;Asylum and Managed Migration&apos;. <lb/>3 <lb/>Total stock numbers (3.85 million in 2012, 2.83 million in 2007) are below the figures reported in OECD <lb/>(2013). This is related to the underlying statistical concept – here international students, in case of OECD <lb/>(2013) foreign students. <lb/></body>

			<body>relative enrolment figures occurred also in favour of other economies in South East Asia, namely the <lb/>Republic of Korea, Malaysia or Thailand. <lb/>Figure 2. Relative attractiveness expressed as Top-10 destination shares <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation <lb/>Note: <lb/>* includes Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau <lb/>** most recent values from 2011 instead of 2012 <lb/>10. <lb/>In an increasingly interconnected and globalised world, students in tertiary education face a <lb/>growing number of potentially attractive destinations to study abroad. One of the essential questions in the <lb/>decades to come is how the EU could manage to remain among the top destinations for international <lb/>students in a world increasingly competing for highly-skilled labour. Another central question in this <lb/>context was how to turn effectively the potential of international students into real gains from an EU <lb/>perspective? Alternatively, referring to the above-noted quotation, one could ask how many brains could <lb/>be borrowed, under which circumstances and how to proceed to retain these talents for a longer time? <lb/>These questions constitute the main research questions guiding this report and defining its structure. <lb/>11. <lb/>In order to highlight students&apos; initial preferences, and a possible interconnectedness with <lb/>subsequent staying behaviour, chapter 2 provides an overview over the distribution of internationally <lb/>mobile students in the EU. The descriptive analysis sheds light on absolute numbers, as well as relative <lb/>numbers in relation to total enrolment. Internationally mobile students&apos; preferences are presented based on <lb/>country (or region) of origin, sex, as well as level and field of study. Aside from a status quo assessment in <lb/>the year 2012, some changes over time are highlighted as well. <lb/>12. <lb/>Chapter 3 is dedicated to the introduction of a measure for international students&apos; staying <lb/>behaviour – the so-called &apos;stay rate&apos;. Main findings from the literature are synthesised, including both <lb/>academic and administrative reports. A meta-study on internationally mobile academics served as starting <lb/>point for the exploratory study, presented in the extended version of this paper (Weisser, 2015a). This <lb/>methodological paper focuses on the derivation of suitable statistics and a detailed empirical assessment of <lb/>staying patterns of internationally mobile students in the EU and its member countries, eventually <lb/>indicating &apos;plausibility bands&apos; for stay rates on the EU level. The main findings, together with a short <lb/>discussion of related core issue, will be briefly summarised in chapter 4.1 of this report. <lb/></body>

			<body>13. <lb/>Yet, the exploratory study&apos;s summary is not to be seen as an end in itself, but rather as <lb/>foundation for an examination of determinants of staying behaviour in two alternative econometric <lb/>frameworks in the remainder of chapter 4. This empirical evaluation is followed by an analysis of potential <lb/>labour market and fiscal consequences and a discussion of implications of changing staying behaviour in <lb/>chapter 5. Based on the previously conducted empirical analyses, chapter 6 deduces some policy <lb/>recommendations. The concluding chapter 7 provides a summary of all previous chapters&apos; essential <lb/>findings. <lb/>2 DISTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONALLY MOBILE STUDENTS IN THE EU <lb/>14. <lb/>From an a priori point of view, the attractiveness of the EU Higher Education Area 4 could be <lb/>one of the most crucial determinants of post-graduation staying behaviour. Only those graduates who chose <lb/>studying in the European Union in the first place can then in a subsequent decision opt for a prolonged stay <lb/>and entry into the European labour market. Consequently, it is not only important to understand what <lb/>makes students staying in a host country after graduation, but also why they came in the beginning, from <lb/>where they originated and which destinations they have chosen. <lb/>15. <lb/>The decision to study abroad, being part of individual investment in human capital, depends not <lb/>only on intrinsic motivation but also on the educational landscape in the country of origin. <lb/>16. <lb/>Figure 3 shows how &apos;outbound mobility ratios&apos; vary across countries. This measure indicates <lb/>how many students study abroad in relation to all students enrolled in the respective country of origin. In <lb/>roughly 50 percent of all countries, this ratio is at least five percent. Especially smaller economies, with <lb/>smaller tertiary educational sectors often display an outbound ratio of more than 10 percent. <lb/>Figure 3. Outbound mobility ratio in 2012, by country of origin <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation <lb/>Note: <lb/>Outbound mobility ratio defined as &apos;Number of students from a given country studying abroad, expressed as a percentage of <lb/>total tertiary enrolment in that country&apos;. <lb/></body>

			<body>17. <lb/>Switching the perspective to the EU as a major destination region, Figure 4 displays the <lb/>percentage changes regarding the number of internationally mobile students 5 enrolled between 2002 and <lb/>2012 by country of origin. Though on average, the EU hosted more internationally mobile students than <lb/>ever, the emerging picture points to a somehow heterogeneous trend. Whilst the number of internationally <lb/>mobile students originating from some countries, for example China and India, more than tripled, other <lb/>countries of origin sent in 2012 distinctly fewer students than one decade ago. <lb/>18. <lb/>What are the reasons for these mixed developments -are they related to changing host or source <lb/>country conditions? Did changing students&apos; preferences or the structure of the tertiary educational system <lb/>contribute to such a pattern? <lb/>Figure 4. Source countries of internationally mobile students from non-EU countries, percentage change <lb/>2002-2012 <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation <lb/>19. <lb/>Referring to credit or degree mobility 6 , literature provides some guidance, for instance <lb/>regarding those general factors affecting students&apos; decision for studying abroad at all, and then, also with <lb/>respect to their preferred destination country. <lb/>5 <lb/>The group of internationally mobile students comprises &apos;international&apos; and &apos;foreign&apos; students. International <lb/>students are those students who crossed a border for studying in a specific destination country whilst their <lb/>usual domicile is abroad (resident concept). Foreign students are those students who do not hold the <lb/>citizenship of the respective country they are studying in (national concept). The first concept depicts <lb/>actual international student mobility in a precise way, but as some countries do only provide information <lb/>on foreign students, the second category cannot be neglected. Subsequent chapters will differentiate <lb/>between these two concepts whilst also commenting on the impact regarding outcomes. <lb/>6 <lb/>Credit mobility refers to short-to medium-duration study spells abroad, typically one or two semesters, <lb/>whilst staying enrolled at a university in the country of origin. Acquired credits from abroad, for instance <lb/>ECTS in the European context, are then allowed for the domestic degree. In contrast to this, degree <lb/>mobility refers to those internationally mobile students who enrol for a complete programme abroad, hence <lb/>obtain their degree abroad. This type of mobility will be at the centre of this work. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.1 Literature review on determinants of cross-border student mobility <lb/>20. <lb/>Aside from mere intrinsic motives, e.g. acquiring additional human capital, externally set <lb/>incentives seem able to foster student mobility as well. Within their analysis of any impact of studying <lb/>abroad on graduates&apos; propensity to start their career abroad, Oosterbeek and Webbink (2009) along with <lb/>Parey and Waldinger (2011) demonstrated that grants to high-achieving students or the availability of <lb/>Erasmus funding schemes increase the likelihood of going abroad during studies significantly. Scrutinizing <lb/>the mobility of ERASMUS-participants, Rodríguez González et al. (2011) focused on host country features <lb/>which possibly serve as pull-factors for intra-European student flows. Using a gravity model, they showed <lb/>that flows are positively affected by size of the host country and the share of the highly educated in the <lb/>country of origin. Quality of receiving institutions and the spoken language in the host country are also <lb/>relevant flow determinants 7 . Typically for findings in the migration context, distance between source and <lb/>destination country dampens flows, even in case of intra-European student mobility. Findings of Caruso <lb/>and de Wit (2013) supported the relevance of a host countries economic performance, regarding integration <lb/>and overall performance, in the context of intra-European student flows. Beyond that, educational spending <lb/>and higher levels of safety are positively associated with a host country&apos;s attractiveness. <lb/>21. <lb/>Following a human capital approach, Perkins and Neumayer (2013) analysed degree mobility <lb/>for a large set of source and destination countries, whilst accounting for distinct socio-political and <lb/>economic features. They also supported findings of Findlay et al. (2012) who stressed acquisition of social <lb/>and cultural capital to be one of the driving forces behind the decision to study abroad. At the same time <lb/>both author groups acknowledged that cross-border student mobility should not be seen as an isolated <lb/>event, but a decision in light of individual career plans. Perkins and Neumayer (2013) presented evidence <lb/>that enrolment abroad is positively influenced by the income level in the host country -an indication for <lb/>better labour market perspectives in a host country and thus possibly increasing benefits of studying <lb/>abroad. Additionally, network effects have been identified, implying that costs of mobility could be <lb/>mitigated by the presence of fellow nationals which could provide information and support. Sharing a <lb/>language, which facilitates studying and daily life likewise, seems to affect the decision to study abroad <lb/>positively as well. Distance, implying higher travel costs, and larger income gaps between sending and <lb/>receiving countries impose both non-negligible impeding factors in a monetary sense. Both effects are <lb/>larger in the case of least developed countries, compared to newly industrialised countries 8 . Institutional <lb/>quality matters primarily for international students from newly industrialised economies whereas higher <lb/>income levels increase host countries attractiveness to a larger extent for students originating from least <lb/>developed countries. <lb/>22. <lb/>The relative importance of higher educational sector&apos;s features is also emphasised by Van <lb/>Bouwel and Veugelers (2010) in an analysis of 18 European countries: a larger student base, better ranking <lb/>positions of universities 9 , tuition fees 10 and especially higher funding per student boost the numbers of <lb/>incoming students. Using data on 13 OECD countries, Beine et al. (2014) confirmed the afore-mentioned <lb/>major results concerning quality and tuition fee, whilst highlighting the signalling effect of tuition fees. <lb/>They also identified a positive network effect, pointing to the relevance of past migration streams. Once <lb/>again, geographical and linguistic proximity have been shown to influence flows positively. <lb/>7 <lb/>i.e. if the spoken official language in the destination country is English, French, German, Italian or Spanish <lb/>, inward flows are higher <lb/>8 <lb/>Both groupings follow the World Bank&apos;s classification in 2010. <lb/>9 <lb/>This may also reflect ranking according to the number of foreign students enrolled. <lb/>10 <lb/>Although perhaps counterintuitive at first glance, tuition fees could be perceived as a sign of quality of a <lb/>host country&apos;s universities, thus attracting more students. <lb/></body>

			<body>23. <lb/>Thissen and Ederveen (2006) focused more on labour market aspects in their evaluation of <lb/>possible determinants of enrolment of foreign students in EEA-countries: they concluded that higher <lb/>income levels and lower unemployment rates substantially foster inflows of foreign students. <lb/>24. <lb/>This short literature review provides some important information on main determinants of <lb/>cross-border student flows: institutional quality, distance, and economic conditions matter. If a host <lb/>country&apos;s tertiary educational system is perceived to be of high quality, more international students chose <lb/>this country as a destination. Geographically closer host countries or those with higher degrees of <lb/>proximity in a cultural or linguistic sense are favoured too. In addition, internationally mobile students <lb/>seem to be influenced by economic perspectives in a potential host country, accordingly to their individual <lb/>career plans. Studying abroad is not merely an &apos;adventure&apos;, but a deliberate choice right from the start. <lb/>25. <lb/>To provide an empirical examination of international students&apos; location choices, the following <lb/>chapter will present the distribution of international and foreign students within the EU Higher Education <lb/>Area. A special focus rests on source countries, as well on degree types and fields of study. <lb/>2.2 Source and destination countries <lb/>26. <lb/>Chapter 2.2 is dedicated to a detailed examination of the distribution of international students <lb/>within destination countries in the European Union, in terms of main countries and regions of origin. Such <lb/>an approach allows illustrating a host country&apos;s attractiveness for students from a specific geographical <lb/>area as well as from a political or economic entity. The results are of a descriptive nature, displaying four <lb/>types of cross-border student mobility: <lb/> intra-European mobility <lb/> students from EFTA countries <lb/> inbound mobility from OECD countries (net EU countries) <lb/> mobility of students from other countries (equal to worldwide net EU, EFTA and OECD countries, <lb/>subsequently also referred to as &apos;third countries&apos; or &apos;other countries&apos;) <lb/>The data is taken from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics database and covers the years 2007 to 2012, <lb/>with a maximum number of 218 possible countries of origin 11 . <lb/>11 <lb/>This number includes seven geographical residual categories for students with &apos;unknown&apos; source countries, <lb/>one within each of the larger geographical units (Africa, Asia, Caribbean and Central America, Europe, <lb/>North America, South America, and Oceania). <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 5. Origins and absolute numbers of incoming non-EU students studying in the EU, 2012 <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation <lb/>27. <lb/>Due to the fact that host countries&apos; population size, and thus also the size of the higher <lb/>education system varies considerably, the remainder of this section is divided into two parts. The first part <lb/>presents absolute enrolment figures of internationally mobile students to assess the relative attractiveness <lb/>of destination countries based on raw numbers. Absorptive capacity of a host country&apos;s tertiary educational <lb/>system is accounted for in the second part, by adjusting these numbers by the size of the respective HE <lb/>system. For each EU host country the value from 2012, if available, and a five year change rate of the <lb/>corresponding indicator will be reported. <lb/>Figure 6. Shares of outgoing students with EU as destination, 2012 <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation <lb/>A first impression regarding the attractiveness of the EU Higher Education Area can be obtained from <lb/>Figure 6. Though Chinese students are the largest group of international students in the EU in absolute <lb/>numbers (see Figure 5), their overall preference for studying in the EU is relatively small: only 23 percent <lb/>of all Chinese students studying abroad came to the EU in 2012. In case of another newly industrialising <lb/>country, i.e. Brazil, students favour the EU clearly – 58 percent chose an EU member state as destination <lb/>for their studies abroad. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2.1 Absolute numbers of international students in EU host countries <lb/>28. <lb/>Europe offers a large selection of possible destination countries, all providing a rich variety of <lb/>structured programmes in tertiary education. Though the Bologna process contributed substantially to a <lb/>harmonization of tertiary education, there still remain distinct features of each potential destination <lb/>country: the spoken language in daily life, the main language used in courses at HE institutions, cultural <lb/>peculiarities and economic conditions. <lb/>29. <lb/>As highlighted in the literature review, these distinct features can be expected to affect the <lb/>choices of international students regarding the preferred host country during their studies. Table 1 presents <lb/>an overview for 2012 of absolute figures for internationally mobile students enrolled in the current 28 <lb/>member states of the European Union, by source regions. <lb/>30. <lb/>Unsurprisingly, the largest number of incoming students (426875) was in 2012 enrolled at a <lb/>university in the UK. France and Germany attracted the second (256261) and third highest number <lb/>(191734) of international students. This picture corresponds to a large extent to the size of a destination <lb/>countries&apos; tertiary educational sector. Other leading destinations were Italy, Austria, Spain and the <lb/>Netherlands which attracted in 2012 between 55000 and 77000 internationally mobile students. With a <lb/>total number of 39128 enrolled international students, the Czech Republic was the leading destination <lb/>country in Central-Eastern Europe in 2012. <lb/></body>

More than two thirds of internationally mobile students originate from another EU <lb/>country in the case of Slovakia, Luxemburg, Austria, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. In 12 <lb/>member states, no more than one out of three international students originates from another EU-country -<lb/>this includes the five most populated EU countries. Intra-European student mobility is thus more important <lb/>in smaller countries. <lb/>32. <lb/>Students from third countries (other countries of origin, not members of EU, EFTA or OECD) <lb/>constitute the largest share in Lithuania. However, this is due to its direct neighbour Belarus, which <lb/>accounts for almost 40 percent of enrolled students from third countries. The highest absolute numbers of <lb/>inbound students from other countries are hosted in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and <lb/>Spain. Seemingly, most populated countries respectively larger economies attracted most students from <lb/>third countries. Within this group of five countries, France has with 73.4 percent the largest share of third <lb/>country students, and Germany with 44.2 percent the lowest. <lb/>33. <lb/>Table A. 1 (in the appendix) shows the Top Five of source countries for each EU member state, <lb/>excluding other EU or EFTA countries. In 11 out of 15 old (pre-2004) EU member states, Chinese students <lb/></body>

			<body>constitute the largest or second largest group of international students from outside the EU or EFTA. This <lb/>source country&apos;s relevance could be interpreted not only as reflecting the massive number of young <lb/>Chinese, but also as an outcome of the new global geographies: Since there occurs a shift of multi-national <lb/>corporations&apos; R&amp;D expenditures towards China as one new geographic focus (Bruche, 2009, p. 274), its <lb/>economy will naturally display an increasing demand for highly qualified employees in R&amp;D. And most <lb/>likely, a substantial fraction of this increased demand initially will be met by hiring employees having <lb/>received tertiary education abroad. <lb/>34. <lb/>The Top Five also suggests the importance of geographical proximity and persistent <lb/>implications of historical or colonial ties. Geographical proximity facilitates travel and the exchange of <lb/>information. Furthermore, it implies often a certain degree of cultural similarity. All those factors might <lb/>affect the costs of mobility in an advantageous way, either by decreasing uncertainty or by reducing <lb/>monetary costs of student mobility. The impact of historical or former colonial ties appears not to be <lb/>restricted to students, but is also found for immigration towards OECD or EU countries in general (see e.g., <lb/>DeWaard et al., 2012; Ortega, 2009) and appears to be increasing for certain countries 12 (Hooghe et al., <lb/>2008). <lb/>35. <lb/>Historical or colonial ties could exert an effect on today&apos;s students&apos; choices in a twofold way: <lb/>first, there are often well established institutional co-operations or programmes between HE institutions or <lb/>an ongoing thought exchange on a governmental or administrative level. These links can contribute to <lb/>lowering uncertainty about what to expect abroad. This can be observed for the Eastern European countries <lb/>having joined the EU in the 2004 enlargement: predominant other source countries are Russia or other <lb/>former members of the onetime Eastern Bloc -even more than two decades after it ceased to exist. Second, <lb/>colonial ties often imply a shared language, as for all of the Portuguese Top Five source countries. A <lb/>common language in turn eases daily life and facilitates the learning process at university (Perkins and <lb/>Neumayer, 2013). <lb/>36. <lb/>Bringing these descriptive findings together highlights that population&apos;s composition of third <lb/>country students in EU countries is partially history-dependent, and partially the result of an increasing <lb/>economic and demographic weight of emerging economies. <lb/>37. <lb/>Within a global market for higher education, the EU is the most important destination region: <lb/>EU countries which were also OECD members attracted almost 31 percent of foreign students worldwide <lb/>in 2011, followed by North America where 21 percent of all foreign students are enrolled in tertiary <lb/>education (OECD, 2013, p. 306). Within the EU, especially the United Kingdom strongly increased its <lb/>market share concerning tertiary education for foreign students within one decade. During the same period, <lb/>the global number of students enrolled outside their country of citizenship increased from 2.1 million in <lb/>2000 to 4.3 million in 2011 (OECD, 2013, p. 306). <lb/>38. <lb/>This dramatic rise in the number of internationally mobile students can be observed in almost <lb/>every single EU member state: since 2007, only Ireland and Croatia recorded a decline in the overall <lb/>number of international students. The increase is to a large extent caused by rising intra-European mobility, <lb/>but is bolstered by rising numbers of students from third countries. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">12 <lb/>Hooghe et al. (2008, p. 502) stated that &quot; [e]specially countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France <lb/>increasingly attract immigrants from their former colonies &quot; , which points even to a persistent importance <lb/>of colonial ties in the future. <lb/></note>

			<body>39. <lb/>As Table 2 reveals, most EU countries 13 hosted higher number of internationally mobile <lb/>students in 2012 than they did five years earlier. Amongst those countries, 13 recorded an even higher <lb/>increase for third country student mobility compared with intra-European student mobility. Belgium, Spain <lb/>and Lithuania have seen the number of internationally mobile students from third countries triple in five <lb/>years. <lb/>40. <lb/>In contrast to this development, Germany was the only major host country to experience a <lb/>decline -of almost 12 percent -in students from non-OECD/EU/EFTA countries, although this may be a <lb/>statistical artefact. 14 <lb/>13 <lb/>At the reference period 2007, two of those 28 countries have acceded to the European Union in this exact <lb/>year (Bulgaria and Romania), and Croatia was not yet a member state. <lb/>14 <lb/>the number of enrolled international students without clear information on country of origin rose to 17,000, <lb/>possibly explaining this decline. <lb/></body>

Inbound ratios for international students from non-EU countries, 2007 and 2012 <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations <lb/>Note: * <lb/>most recent values from 2011 <lb/>** most recent values from 2010 <lb/>45. <lb/>The majority of countries experienced a growing share of third country students. A number of <lb/>countries have, however, seen declines: Austria, Ireland and Portugal, principally. In the case of Austria, <lb/>the decrease is primarily attributable to a considerable drop of the enrolment of students from China as <lb/>well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. For Ireland and Portugal, the disadvantageous economic developments in <lb/>the analysed time horizon serve as likely explanations. <lb/>46. <lb/>How successful was the European Union overall with respect to attracting international <lb/>students? In relation to enrolment of domestic students a distinct answer can be given: Overall, the <lb/>European Union saw an increase in the weighted 15 inbound ratio of third country students from 2.9 to 3.8 <lb/>percent (EU students: 1.9 to 2.4 percent). The average increase in third country student inbound ratio in the <lb/>EU 28 is not driven by the rising enrolment of international students in the UK, but by a rather evenly <lb/>spread increase in internationalisation across the EU. Excluding the UK from the average still yields an <lb/>increase of 0.7 percentage points (instead of 0.9 percentage points) on the aggregate level. <lb/>15 <lb/>The weighting procedure accounts for substantial differences in the size of the tertiary educational sectors <lb/>of the examined countries. Each country-level inbound rate was weighted by the number of students <lb/>enrolled in this specific county, í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡ . Germany and Luxembourg are not included as no corresponding <lb/>figures for 2007 are available. <lb/></body>

			<body>47. <lb/>Whilst an analysis of absolute numbers for all internationally mobile students previously <lb/>(chapter 2.2.1) portrayed an unbalanced development, the overall trend relative to the size of their tertiary <lb/>educational system is once again similar across countries, as indicated by Figure 8. <lb/>48. <lb/>The inbound rate for all internationally mobile students in the EU rose from 2007 to 2012 by <lb/>1.5 percentage points on average. Consequently, international students represent a larger share of the <lb/>tertiary educational system within the European Union. Such findings give rise to the hypothesis that the <lb/>absorptive capacity of HE institutions evolves in a comparable manner across EU member states. <lb/>Figure 8. Inbound ratios for all internationally mobile students, 2007 and 2012 <lb/>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations <lb/>Note: <lb/>* <lb/>most recent values from 2011 <lb/>** most recent values from 2010 <lb/>49. <lb/>Aside from Luxembourg (figures from 2010) with by far smallest tertiary educational system in <lb/>the EU, Austria and Cyprus have the highest inbound rates referring to intra-EU mobility (see Table A. 2 <lb/>in the appendix). In the first case, a substantial number of German students, studying at universities in the <lb/>neighbouring country in the South-East, inflates this value; in the latter case, the result is mainly driven by <lb/>Greek students. Among large EU countries, only the United Kingdom has such a high share of EU students <lb/>enrolled at its tertiary institutions. In 2012, the share of European students in total enrolment in France, <lb/>Germany, Italy and Spain was lower than in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Denmark. <lb/>50. <lb/>When third country students are considered, the picture changes: France experiences large <lb/>inflows from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, pushing it into the Top three of destination countries. The fifth <lb/>and sixth highest inbound ratios, referring to third country students, can be found for Finland and Sweden. <lb/>Though these two countries rank relatively low as a destination for European students, they successfully <lb/>attract students from third countries. For most Eastern European countries, in contrast, the shares of <lb/>students from other countries are almost negligible. <lb/>51. <lb/>From an aerial perspective, looking at the European Union as a whole, the share of international <lb/>students enrolled increases. Universities across the EU become more diverse with respect to students&apos; <lb/>origins. This increase is in line with one of the major goals of Council Directive 2004/114/EC, namely <lb/> &quot; [p]romoting the mobility of third-country nationals to the Community for the purpose of studies &quot; <lb/>(European Commission, 2004, p. 1). <lb/>52. <lb/>Whilst previously described patterns provide credible evidence that the European Union is an <lb/>increasingly attractive place for temporary studies it yet has to be determined whether the EU is also <lb/>attractive to international graduates in a short-, medium-or long-run. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.3 Gender distributions of international students <lb/>53. <lb/>Studying abroad is not only an important aspect from an educational point of view, enlarging <lb/>the intellectual horizon and strengthening human capital. It offers also the opportunity for academic <lb/>exchange, and to participation in cultural or daily life of the destination country. Yet, there might be an <lb/>alternative aspect of participation which could provide valuable insights into the attractiveness of the EU <lb/>Higher Education Area, namely women&apos;s participation in international tertiary education. While the data <lb/>structure prevents conducting analyses on the source country level, it is possible to look at the time series <lb/>from 2002. <lb/>54. <lb/>Table A. 3 (in the appendix) contrasts inbound rates of male and female international students, <lb/>giving information on the gender-specific share of international students in relation to the respective <lb/>gender&apos;s enrolment numbers in a given country. For roughly 50 percent of the country-year observations <lb/>the ratios are balanced. For the majority of other cases, the female inbound ratio is at least 20 percent larger <lb/>or smaller than the corresponding male rate. Usually, the latter case prevails. <lb/>55. <lb/>As the presented numbers are ratios, the gender difference is not to be interpreted at face value <lb/>since its causes cannot be unambiguously determined. Gender differences within countries could emerge <lb/>either from gender differences between inbound numbers or differences between gender-specific enrolment <lb/>numbers, the latter primarily caused by domestic student enrolment. Hence, presented ratios for the three <lb/>observation points in time should be interpreted with caution in a within-country context. <lb/>56. <lb/>Despite this limitation, the ratios provided can be used to evaluate between-country differences <lb/>with respect to attractiveness on international students of a given gender in a specific year. What can be <lb/>derived is that for instance Austria draws more female international students than Denmark in relation to <lb/>each countries female total enrolment numbers (15.3% vs. 7.3% in 2012). Countries with relatively fewer <lb/>women than men include Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Romania and Sweden. <lb/></body>

Observable female/male enrolment ratios <lb/>for internationally mobile students show that there might be some destination countries which are <lb/>persistently preferred by one sex, compared to the other. Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain display <lb/>at all three reference points a larger number of female international students. <lb/>58. <lb/>The overall picture shows varying relative participation of female international students across <lb/>countries. But why are there substantial differences in internationally mobile students&apos; preferences between <lb/>the two sexes? <lb/>59. <lb/>Two main mechanisms could be driving this outcome: First, one should remember that host <lb/>countries display a heterogeneous composition of their international student body with regard to students&apos; <lb/>origins – some have a larger share of students from other EU member states, others a higher share from <lb/>other continents (see Table 1 and Table 2). Aside from general socio-cultural differences between countries <lb/>of origin and destination countries, distance could matter as well. <lb/>16 <lb/>The underlying data source provides only aggregate figures and an inbound rate for female <lb/>students, thus absolute figures for male and female enrolment of internationally mobile students <lb/>have to be &apos;recovered&apos;. <lb/></body>

			<body>60. <lb/>Keeping the possibly mobility-deterring effect of distance in mind, there is evidence that <lb/>willingness to migrate is associated to individual risk attitudes: less risk-averse individuals are more <lb/>willing to migrate (Jaeger et al., 2010; Nowotny, 2010). At the same time, women tend to be more risk-<lb/>averse in general than men (Dohmen et al., 2011), or even when several definitions of risk domains are <lb/>separately investigated (see e.g., Charness and Gneezy, 2012; Nicholson et al., 2005). There is even some <lb/>evidence of a relationship between risk attitude and migration patterns on the level of short-to medium <lb/>distance migration, when it comes to students&apos; choice of a study location (Weisser, 2015b). 17 <lb/>61. <lb/>In addition, gender-specific returns to education abroad might be influential as well: if studying <lb/>abroad was associated with a certain risk and women&apos;s marginal returns to the acquisition of <lb/>transnationally applicable human capital were lower, they would benefit less from studying abroad at more <lb/>remote destinations than their male fellow students. Consequently, if a host country was particularly <lb/>attractive to students from a specific remote country of origin, e.g. due to historically established <lb/>connections, it might be that only the most risk-seeking students with highest expected returns would <lb/>embark on the journey of studying several years abroad. This could explain higher inbound numbers of <lb/>male students in some countries. <lb/>62. <lb/>A second driving force of gender imbalances regarding numbers of inbound students could <lb/>reflect the portfolio of study programmes and access criteria in the tertiary educational system itself. If a <lb/>country had an especially strong focus on engineering sciences, it would plausibly attract a larger share of <lb/>those international students who are interested in such programmes. Gender differences concerning <lb/>enrolment preferences are known from domestic students and could apply to international students as well. <lb/>For example, Charles and Bradley (2009) examined students&apos; enrolment choices in 44 developing, <lb/>transitional or industrialised countries and show that women are underrepresented in the field of <lb/>engineering in all countries and overrepresented in the field of humanities and social sciences. Barone <lb/>(2011) concentrated on eight European countries and points to distinct gender differences in graduation <lb/>numbers on a finer grid of 14 different fields of study. He, too, identified gender-related preference <lb/>disparities which are also remarkably stable over time. Thus, regardless of the economic development of <lb/>source or destination countries, there remain substantial differences in gender-specific tastes. <lb/>63. <lb/>Plausibly, this will also come into play when it comes to enrolment at a European university, <lb/>and accordingly, gender-specific inbound rates will be affected. <lb/>2.4 Internationally mobile students by field of study <lb/>64. <lb/>As the choice of a specific destination country or a receiving institution will be heavily <lb/>influenced by the programmes and curricula offered, international students preferences for various fields of <lb/>studies will be examined in this paragraph. Overall, there is credible evidence that some sorting of students <lb/>into specific host countries occurs according to their tastes for a given field. At the same time, the <lb/>distribution of preferences implies that internationally mobile students do not display a higher preference <lb/>for the STEM fields in general. <lb/>Table 4. Relative study preferences of internationally mobile students, 2012 <lb/>student <lb/>type <lb/>total <lb/>enrolment <lb/>(ISCED 5 <lb/>+ <lb/>ISCED 6) <lb/>Education <lb/>Humanities <lb/>and <lb/>arts <lb/>Social <lb/>sciences, <lb/>business <lb/>and <lb/>law <lb/>Science, mathematics <lb/>and <lb/>computing <lb/>Engineering, manufacturing <lb/>and <lb/>construction <lb/>Agriculture <lb/>and <lb/>veterinary <lb/>Health <lb/>and <lb/>Welfare <lb/>Services <lb/>Unknown <lb/>field <lb/>Austria <lb/>int. <lb/>58056 5.6% <lb/>17.2% <lb/>39.0% <lb/>11.9% <lb/>14.0% <lb/>1.9% <lb/>8.7% <lb/>1.5% <lb/>0.3% <lb/>17 <lb/>i.e., even over short distances, the more risk-averse the student, the less s/he will want to migrate <lb/></body>

			<body>on internationally mobile students is available, international students are concentrated in those <lb/>programmes. 19 <lb/>66. <lb/>There is also a large fraction of internationally mobile students who chose Belgium, Hungary, <lb/>Latvia, Poland or Romania in order to enrol in the field of health or welfare. Engineering, manufacturing or <lb/>construction programmes draw internationally mobile students to Denmark, Finland, Germany and <lb/>Sweden. <lb/>67. <lb/>The fields of education, services, as well as agriculture or veterinary science are the least <lb/>chosen from the perspective of internationally mobile students. Within the four most preferred fields of <lb/>internationally mobile students, the dominating choices are humanities, business and administration, <lb/>computing and engineering respectively. <lb/>68. <lb/>Overall, there is credible evidence that some sorting of students into specific host countries <lb/>occurs according to their tastes for a given field. At the same time, the distribution of preferences implies <lb/>that internationally mobile students do not display a higher preference for the STEM fields in general. <lb/>2.5 Mobile students by study level and type <lb/>69. <lb/>Further insights can be obtained from disaggregating the international student body by level of <lb/>study. As the underlying goal of this work is an examination of factors which induce internationally mobile <lb/>students from other countries to stay in Europe after graduation, special attention will be paid to post-<lb/>graduate studies (ISCED 6). <lb/>70. <lb/>There are two reasons to focus on post-graduate education. First, if someone obtained a first or <lb/>second stage degree (Bachelor or Master, ISCED 5) within the EU Higher Education Area and choses then <lb/>to stay for doctoral studies (ISCED 6), this can be seen as an indication of attachment to the host country <lb/>and willingness to prolong the stay in general. <lb/>71. <lb/>Furthermore, there is some evidence that PhD students are more inclined to stay in the host <lb/>country than bachelor or master students after graduation (OECD, 2014). And, even if some international <lb/>post-graduate students earned their first degree outside the EU, they would still contribute during their <lb/>post-graduate studies to a host country&apos;s research output. <lb/>72. <lb/>The average ratio of post-graduate (ISCED 6) internationally mobile students to internationally <lb/>mobile students enrolled in a first-stage (ISCED 5) programme is 0.093 20 in 2012 for the EU 28 (Table 5). <lb/>In the United Kingdom, for example, there is one international post-graduate student enrolled for ten first-<lb/>stage international students. <lb/>73. <lb/>In agriculture and veterinary science, although total enrolment numbers are low, there is a <lb/>substantial share of international students coming to a European country for their doctoral education. <lb/>Similarly, in the fields of science, mathematics and computing as well as engineering, manufacturing and <lb/>construction, international PhD students have a more pronounced preference for studying in the EU than <lb/>international bachelor and master students do. <lb/>19 <lb/>Cyprus is the most obvious outlier. Here, almost 73 percent of international students are enrolled in the <lb/>field of social science, business and administration. <lb/>20 <lb/>Each countries ratio is weighted by the total number of enrolled international students in this respective <lb/>country. <lb/></body>

			<body>3 POST-GRADUATION STAY RATES IN THE LITERATURE <lb/>75. <lb/>Attracting international students during the course of their studies is one possible way <lb/>immigration can contribute to a knowledge economy. But how could the EU benefit from these talents <lb/>after graduation? <lb/>76. <lb/>Keeping a share of those graduates in Europe – the larger, the better – would contribute to this <lb/>goal. Having examined the distribution of internationally mobile students within the European Union, the <lb/>pool of potential stayers, the focus shall be shifted to the main part of this paper, namely understanding and <lb/>empirically examining staying behaviour of international graduates. <lb/>77. <lb/>The literature identifies several issues regarding the quantitative assessment of such staying <lb/>behaviour: Precise identification of international students on a cross-country level is the first challenge. A <lb/>second complication is the fact that internationally mobile individuals are often hard to track – if they <lb/>graduate from university, they can easily disappear from the &apos;administrative radar&apos; and in many cases it is <lb/>virtually impossible to follow them, and therefore to calculate reliable stay rates. <lb/>78. <lb/>Furthermore, staying behaviour is a dynamic phenomenon: although some international <lb/>graduates decide to stay immediately after graduation in the host country, they may change their minds in a <lb/>subsequent period – perhaps due to worsening economic conditions in the host country -and go back to <lb/>their country of origin or a third country. Others may have planned right from enrolment to study and then <lb/>gain initial work experience in a foreign country before returning after some years. Consequently, a <lb/>cohort&apos;s stay rate immediately after graduation will almost surely decline as time passes. This stresses the <lb/>importance of establishing stay rates&apos; reference periods. <lb/>79. <lb/>The following literature review 21 delivers a status quo picture, but also shines a light on <lb/>potential pitfalls with respect to the chosen calculation method. These findings serve as foundation for an <lb/>assessment of the feasibility and error-proneness of various proposed calculation methods in the extended <lb/>version of this paper; only the main implications and results will be presented in chapter 4 of this paper. <lb/>80. <lb/>There are two main branches in the literature on staying patterns of internationally mobile <lb/>students, respective academics in general. One is dedicated to the examination of stay (or return) rates <lb/>where the underlying implicit research question is who stays or returns after having graduated abroad? <lb/>Here, students displaying degree-mobility are in the centre of interest and it is possible to derive stay rates <lb/>in or return rates from a given host country, since information on host and source country is available. <lb/>81. <lb/>The second branch, which does not directly address stay or return rates, is guided by the slightly <lb/>different question who chooses to start a career abroad after having spent some time during studies <lb/>abroad? In this line of research, the usual observation unit are students exhibiting credit-mobility and it is <lb/>only known that they started their career either &apos;somewhere&apos; outside their home country or they have <lb/>returned from &apos;somewhere&apos;. Since there are many similarities between conceptual approaches and <lb/>discussed determinants, the second branch offers valuable insights with respect to locational choices of <lb/>graduates. <lb/>82. <lb/>In order to generate insights into observable staying behaviour, which is the prerequisite for any <lb/>evaluation of stay or return rates, staying or returning intentions are left out. Publications covered in this <lb/>21 <lb/>This literature review is not exhaustive, but includes the most prominent publications from 2002 onwards, <lb/>dedicated to stay or return rates of international or foreign academics, comprising students, graduates or <lb/>researchers. <lb/></body>

			<body>literature review represent authors&apos; most recent version of a paper discussing truly observable stay or <lb/>return decisions on an empirical basis. 22 <lb/>3.1 Credit mobility and the likelihood of starting a career abroad <lb/>83. <lb/>Typically, research on the effects of studying abroad concentrates primarily on the <lb/>improvement of language proficiency, intercultural skills or a change of individual attitudes or valuations. <lb/>If authors try to establish a connection between working abroad and previous experiences as internationally <lb/>mobile student, the data does not allow a comparison with a suitable reference group, i.e. non-mobile <lb/>graduates (Bracht et al., 2006; Norris and Gillespie, 2009). This in turn makes it virtually impossible to <lb/>infer a reliable effect of studying abroad. <lb/>84. <lb/>The overall focus on soft skills, network and intercultural aspects also applies in the context of <lb/>the few specifically designed long-term studies where authors used a suitable control group (Hansel, 2008; <lb/>Paige et al., 2010). Actual labour market outcomes, and thus any possible dependency from earlier <lb/>experiences abroad, are for the most part ignored. Instead, possible interconnections between credit <lb/>mobility on the one hand and self-assessed &apos;employability&apos;, a vaguely specified &apos;international dimension&apos; <lb/>in the job or &apos;intentions to work abroad&apos; on the other hand are examined. <lb/>85. <lb/>Limiting the review to quantitative studies of actually observable or retrospectively reported <lb/>episodes of employment abroad excludes a vast amount of small or medium scale survey publications, <lb/>relying mainly on descriptive presentations. <lb/>86. <lb/>Despite this restriction, a coherent picture arises in the investigated literature (see overview in <lb/>the extended version of this paper): When non-mobile students are used as a reference group, studying <lb/>abroad exerts an effect with respect to the chosen location of graduates&apos; labour market entry. <lb/>87. <lb/>For a short-to medium-term perspective (one to seven years after graduation), Parey and <lb/>Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro (2012) reported – whilst accounting for potential endogeneity of the <lb/>decision to study abroad – that Erasmus participation increases likelihood of starting the working career <lb/>abroad by 12 to 24 percentage points. Wiers-Jenssen (2008) presented smaller values, between 2 and 4 <lb/>percentage points, which come close to the OLS-benchmark values of the first two publications. <lb/>Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011) provided evidence that studying abroad also affects high achieving <lb/>students, with a stay abroad lowering the likelihood of starting working life in the country of origin by 30 <lb/>percentage points. <lb/>88. <lb/>Enlarging the time horizon to two decades after graduation, Voin and Gérard (2013) as well as <lb/>King and Ruiz-Gelices (2003) calculated probability differentials for those who studied abroad, finding <lb/>that the share of those who ever worked abroad after graduation was between 9 and 17 percentage points <lb/>larger within this group of formerly mobile students. <lb/>89. <lb/>Overall, the limited literature on the relationship between international study experience and <lb/>labour market entry location yields credible evidence for a positive and robust effect of student mobility on <lb/>the likelihood of starting a career as an expatriate. Studying at least one semester abroad raises the <lb/>likelihood of working after graduation in another country substantially, although the effect&apos;s magnitude <lb/>22 <lb/>Only the latest versions are cited, unless methodology and data source have changed. <lb/></body>

			<body>may vary considerably between fields of study, type of mobility programme, and applied evaluation <lb/>method 23 . <lb/>3.2 Degree mobility and stay rates for specific countries <lb/>90. <lb/>The type of cross-border mobility examined in this paragraph is mainly degree-mobility, since <lb/>only this type of mobility can provide answers to the question &apos;How large is the share of internationally <lb/>mobile students who stay in the host country after graduation?&apos; <lb/>91. <lb/>All but one of the 41 publications covered are from the periods 2002-2014, hence the same <lb/>timeframe that is also covered by this work&apos;s empirical part. The extended version of this paper comprises <lb/>detailed tables with a comprehensive overview over the main findings from the literature review. <lb/>92. <lb/>While all included publications address the phenomenon of international students&apos; post-<lb/>graduation mobility behaviour in one way or another, the procedures and data sources chosen varied <lb/>widely. Furthermore, derived results vary depending on the precise group under scrutiny, observed field of <lb/>study, combination of host and source country, time horizon, reference point in time etc. <lb/>93. <lb/>The first conclusion to be drawn is that no unique stay rate for international students exists for a <lb/>given country, but rather a multitude of stay rates. This reflects not primarily imprecise calculation <lb/>methods or small sample sizes, but great variance in the angle of observation. As a special case for <lb/>example, Ruiz (2014) ascertained even different stay rates related to varying levels of aggregation for the <lb/>US: whilst one third stayed after graduation in the US, 15 percentage points of foreign students lingered <lb/>even in the same metropolitan area. <lb/>94. <lb/>Nonetheless, some central tendencies and common patterns can be derived for some types of <lb/>bilateral stay rates or reference groups. <lb/>95. <lb/>A substantial number of authors (e.g. Achato et al., 2011; Bratsberg, 1995; Guo, 2010; <lb/>Merwood, 2007; OECD, 2011; Wilkinson et al., 2010) calculated stay rates based on permit status changes <lb/>of former students: the number of status changers over international (foreign) graduates or students. This <lb/>gives an idea how many international students have been granted (temporary) residence. Those studies <lb/>relied on large sample sizes, but overall results are sensitive to administrative and legislative changes over <lb/>time. Consequently, the figures presented should be interpreted as stay rates for individuals who were <lb/>allowed to stay instead of those who chose to stay. <lb/>96. <lb/>Short-term stay rates are much higher than medium-term stay rates (Finn, 2012; Ministeriet for <lb/>Forskning, Innovation og Videregående Uddannelser, 2013; Nemeckova and Krylova, 2014; Suter and <lb/>Jandl, 2006), reflecting a non-negligible subsequent emigration wave of initial stayers. The declining <lb/>numbers of stayers stabilise in a longer perspective. Nevertheless, the dynamic aspect of a staying decision, <lb/>which can be revised even years after graduation, is rarely accounted for directly. Only studies relying on a <lb/>survey, or those tracking career histories (CIDA, 2005; Sage et al., 2013; Tian, 2013), provide information <lb/>regarding repeated migration events in the context of international students&apos; mobility. Unfortunately, they <lb/>suffer from small or very small sample size, most times below 500 subject-specific observations (e.g. <lb/>Badikyan, 2011; Bond et al., 2006; Lehr, 2008; Silver, 2012). <lb/>97. <lb/>In general, medium-to long-run stay rates of doctoral students and researchers tend to be higher <lb/>than those of undergraduate students (Gaule, 2011; van Bouwel and Veugelers, 2012; van de Sande et al., <lb/>23 <lb/>Estimated coefficients of Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011), Parey and Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro <lb/>(2012) are larger in absolute magnitude since they are local average treatment effects. <lb/></body>

			<body>2005). This may be linked to a different focus at the time of the decisions to go abroad, although it may <lb/>also reflect greater returns to postgraduate degrees, or favourable policy settings for those with advanced <lb/>degrees. <lb/>98. <lb/>Students from countries with weaker economic conditions tend to display higher stay rates in <lb/>economically more developed countries than their peers from other economically developed countries <lb/>(Hein and Plesch, 2008; Vasiljev, 2014). Chinese and Indian international students are usually amongst <lb/>those with highest stay rates (Achato et al., 2011; Wang, 2012; Zang and Li, 2002). <lb/>99. <lb/>International students or researchers in a scholarship programme mostly leave the respective <lb/>host countries after graduation (Hein and Plesch, 2008; Lehr, 2008; van de Sande et al., 2005). This is <lb/>related to specific features of the scholarships, i.e. requiring students to leave after graduation. A second <lb/>explanation is that such grants can be a component of a development aid programme in fields relatively <lb/>more valued in source countries, for instance agriculture. <lb/>100. <lb/>With respect to field of study, stay rates of international students enrolled in natural sciences or <lb/>in a technical field tend to be higher than for those enrolled in social sciences and humanities. Retention <lb/>rates are especially higher in the field of life sciences (Finn, 2012; Kim et al., 2011; Wolfeil, 2009). <lb/>101. <lb/>Amongst those studies who reported gender-specific stay rates, results point to a more <lb/>pronounced staying behaviour of female international students. Where there was a substantial difference <lb/>between stay rates of the two sexes, male students are typically more prone to leave the host country after <lb/>they graduated (Bijwaard, 2010; Vasiljeva, 2014). <lb/>102. <lb/>Focusing on the EU, literature provides even more scarce guidance: only for approximately one <lb/>third of the current 28 EU members stay rates could be found. Once again, stay rates vary between bilateral <lb/>pairs of host and source countries (or regions), and across applied methodologies (Felbermayr and <lb/>Reczkowski, 2012 presented for the EU a kind of upper limit of 71%). The highest rates can be observed <lb/>for the UK, Germany, France, Denmark and the Netherlands -also five of the countries with highest per <lb/>capita income. Aside from the Netherlands and Denmark, they also have the largest tertiary educational <lb/>sectors. Also noteworthy is that stay rates based on permit data seem to be smaller than figures based on <lb/>survey or administrative micro-data. This might be attributable to the fact that implemented surveys <lb/>typically addressed a specific sub-sample of internationally mobile students, e.g. alumni of a university or <lb/>participants in a scholarship programme. In these cases special effort is exerted to track members of the <lb/>designated target group. Yet, if stayers had a higher response rate than returnees, as they first group might <lb/>be easier to track, results would be skewed towards higher stay rates. <lb/>103. <lb/>In the end, a non-conclusive picture emerges from the literature. There is an urgent need to <lb/>develop a more coherent approach to evaluate stay rates of internationally mobile students. To conduct <lb/>reliable between-country or between-group analyses, a robust methodological framework, underpinned by <lb/>comparable and reliable data, is required. <lb/>3.3 Determinants of post-graduation staying behaviour <lb/>104. <lb/>Having sketched some potential determinants of international students&apos; initial locational choices <lb/>in chapter 2, the extent to which those factors also contribute to international graduates&apos; staying decision <lb/>shall now be explored. <lb/>105. <lb/>Some host country characteristics, e.g. a specific language or cultural similarities, might affect <lb/>international students and graduates all alike. Other destination country features, such as labour market <lb/>conditions around graduation time or work permit regulations might have a more severe impact on the <lb/>decisions of graduates as they are immediately concerned. <lb/></body>

			<body>106. <lb/>In the literature on international student stay rates a number of publications assess determinants <lb/>of international students&apos; staying behaviour from a quantitative point of view. This subchapter summarises <lb/>already identified determinants or promising candidates and evaluates their magnitude, as indicated in the <lb/>literature. <lb/>107. <lb/>As one of the first authors, Bratsberg (1995) investigated possible determinants of students&apos; <lb/>long-run stay rates in the US for a set of 69 countries of origin in an econometrical framework. Within his <lb/>analysis special attention was paid to general economic and labour market differences between destination <lb/>and source countries. He presented evidence that earnings variations in both countries played a significant <lb/>role in explaining students staying behaviour. If earnings increased in the US by one standard deviation, <lb/>the average stay rate rose by 3.2 percentage points. Similarly, a one standard deviation decrease in the <lb/>source countries&apos; labour income raised the long-term stay rate by 8.2 percentage points. Furthermore, <lb/>higher degrees of income inequality or higher returns to education in the country of origin were associated <lb/>with lower stay rates. Interpreting higher earnings variation as an indication of a relatively higher valuation <lb/>of specific skills, this result points to the special importance of skills&apos; valuation in the home country – if <lb/>engineers were comparably poorly rewarded in the country of origin, international engineering graduates <lb/>would prefer to stay in the respective host country. If the source country&apos;s GDP was to double, observed <lb/>stay rate would decline on average by 5.5 percentage points. Bratsberg (1995) extended his empirical <lb/>analysis also to non-economic aspects: increasing geographical distance coincided with a higher stay rate 24 , <lb/>so did stronger immigration ties between source and destination country. <lb/>108. <lb/>In its evaluation of the Canadian Francophone Scholarship Program (CFSP), part of Canadian <lb/>development assistance, CIDA (2005) pointed to factors which made some former scholarship holders stay <lb/>in Canada. Amongst this group, the opportunity to bring one&apos;s family to Canada right from the start was <lb/>mentioned as fostering staying behaviour. The desire to gather working experience in an industrialised <lb/>country, specific job offers in Canada, respectively the lack of attractive job opportunities in the home <lb/>countries were also major concerns of those who stayed. The general socio-political and academic culture <lb/>in the host country, as well as non-deterring immigration regulations were referred to by survey <lb/>participants as relevant reasons for staying. <lb/>109. <lb/>In a discussion of brain circulation, Rosenzweig (2006) evaluated factors affecting the <lb/>depreciation rate of foreign student stocks in the US 25 . He derived that if the skill price in the source <lb/>country doubles, the stay rate decreased by 32 to 41 percent. Foreign students from Asian countries were in <lb/>general less likely to stay in the US after they completed their study programme, but they were also found <lb/>to react more sensitively to changes in skill prices. <lb/>110. <lb/>Within their analysis of locational and work place choice of Dutch graduates, Venhorst et al. <lb/>(2010) examined possible determinants of staying in peripheral regions of the Netherlands. They indicated <lb/>that students born outside of Europe were in general much more likely to leave these regions for work <lb/>abroad than to stay. This effect was even more pronounced for students from other European countries. <lb/>24 <lb/>If the distance between the home country&apos;s capital and the closest US gateway increased by 1000 miles, the <lb/>stay rate increased by 3.4 percentage points. The distance was likely to capture monetary and psychological <lb/>migration costs, thus staying would be a strategy to avoid the costs of re-migration to the country of origin. <lb/>25 <lb/>Rosenzweig (2006) calculated a stock depreciation rate, using asan unadjusted numerator students with an <lb/>F-1 visa who adjusted their status within a seven month period in 2003, rather than twelve months. In the <lb/>model specification, GDP in the source country is excluded &quot; as financing cost should not be a <lb/>significant factor for the decision to return &quot; . Rosenzwieg&apos;s model of returning behaviour includes <lb/>university ranking variables. In a subsequent version Rosenzweig (2008) accounts for average GDP growth <lb/>but not the possible impact of overall wealth of a source country. <lb/></body>

			<body>However, regions near a border successfully maintained high ability students from other countries, as they <lb/>were more inclined to stay than to start a career abroad. <lb/>111. <lb/>Conducting an analysis of life cycle migration to the Netherlands, Bijwaard (2010) applied <lb/>several mover-stayer duration models which identified factors that influence the probability of becoming a <lb/>stayer for several groups of migrants, including students. For students, he showed that the longer students <lb/>stayed in the Netherlands, the less likely they were to leave. If students were older than 25 years when they <lb/>arrived, they were also less likely to stay, but this effect diminished with increasing age. Accounting for re-<lb/>migration events, after having left the Netherlands, the author derived long-run probabilities for residing in <lb/>the Netherlands. Based on estimates, generated within the mover-stayer duration framework, he presented <lb/>distinct results in comparison to a student reference migrant 26 : married or female international students 27 <lb/>had a higher propensity to stay in the long-run in the Netherlands. This held true to an even larger extent <lb/>for students from other European countries (non-EU members), Turkey, China or Africa. Students from <lb/>English-speaking countries of origin, such as the UK, the USA or Canada, displayed either a similar or <lb/>lower probability of staying as the reference student does. Students from new EU-members and Germany, <lb/>in contrast, had a higher likelihood of staying – in the first cases economic differentials might matter, in the <lb/>latter case geographical or cultural proximity could serve as possible explanations. <lb/>112. <lb/>In a follow-up study Bijwaard and Wang (2013) shifted their analytical focus fully to <lb/>international students and investigated the relevance of labour market and family formation dynamics after <lb/>graduation too. Using a &apos;timing-of-events&apos; approach they estimated the impact of employment or <lb/>unemployment spells as well as of marriage on the hazard of leaving the Netherlands after graduation. The <lb/>social factor &apos;marriage&apos; reduced for sub-groups the hazard of returning, thus implies a prolonged stay in the <lb/>Netherlands. Aside from the special group of students from Surinam or the Antilles, finding employment <lb/>affected this hazard in the same way, but the impact was less pronounced. Unemployment spells affected <lb/>students from different regions or origin in varying ways: students from EU-15 and EFTA countries, less <lb/>developed countries and the afore-mentioned former colonies tended to return as reaction to individual <lb/>unemployment. The opposite holds true for students from other developed countries. <lb/>113. <lb/>Hein and Plesch (2008) used administrative data from a large Catholic scholarship-providing <lb/>institution to evaluate determinants of return for scholarship holders from developing or transitioning <lb/>countries who studied in Germany. Personal factors, such as age, having children or closer ties to the home <lb/>country were found to be negatively related to the likelihood of staying. Network effects tended to increase <lb/>only men&apos;s propensity to stay. Language proximity between the home country language and German <lb/>predicted staying behaviour in a pronounced manner, as did the time spent in Germany. Women were also <lb/>more likely to stay in general, and they reacted more sensitively to both factors. Hein and Plesch (2008) <lb/>provided also some insights regarding the impact of economic and political factors: poor labour market <lb/>conditions in the destination country or rising living standards in the country of origin made international <lb/>students return, and the former seems to especially affect women&apos;s decisions. Greater economic or political <lb/>freedom, and better living conditions for women in the home country, lowered the likelihood of staying <lb/>after graduation. Regarding the source regions, students from Asia were less inclined to stay in Germany <lb/>after graduation whilst historical ties operated in the opposite way for African students. <lb/>26 <lb/>The student reference migrant is defined as unmarried 21 year old male student originating from an EU15 <lb/>or EFTA country, not including Germany, the UK and France. His long-run staying probability is 21 <lb/>percent. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">27 <lb/>Most interestingly, the parameter estimate of females intensity to return (after having left) in the student <lb/>sample is negative – if they leave once, they are less inclined to return than their male peers. <lb/></note>

			<body>114. <lb/>Scrutinising returning decisions of scientists who joined a US chemistry department during <lb/>graduate studies or post-doctoral career, Gaule (2011) estimated a discrete-time model of the hazard of <lb/>return. He derived that those who came during their graduate studies were only one third as likely to return <lb/>as those who came as faculty. Recognising the potential impact of a selective stay or return decision he <lb/>controlled for researchers&apos; ability too: academic scientist within the highest category of productivity, <lb/>measured as number of publications weighted by publishing journals&apos; impact factors, were approximately <lb/>twice as likely to stay in the US. Beyond individual factors he also evaluated the possible influence of <lb/>source countries&apos; characteristics on the staying behaviour. He found that if GDP per capita in a country of <lb/>origin was to increase by USD 1,000, the odds of return were to increase by 20 percent. Considering a <lb/>home country&apos;s scientific strength in the field of chemistry, measured as relevant publications in relation to <lb/>its population, any significant impact on the staying decision disappeared when controlling for country&apos;s <lb/>wealth. <lb/>115. <lb/>Drawing from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), Kim et al. (2011) examined <lb/>determinants of staying behaviour for three cohorts (1980s, 1990s and 2000s) of foreign post-graduate <lb/>students in the US in a large sample. The impact of age diminished in later cohorts whilst female graduates <lb/>were persistently more inclined towards staying. His findings supported also the claim that students&apos; <lb/>attachment to a host country – as measured by continuing directly with post-graduate studies -is a non-<lb/>negligible factor: those who came to the US for their undergraduate studies were twice as likely to stay <lb/>after their PhD-Studies. Compared to the staying behaviour of the Canadian reference group, Chinese, <lb/>Indian and Korean students were always much more likely to stay. Though Europeans and students from <lb/>Africa displayed a higher likelihood too, they were less likely to stay than their peers from the three Asian <lb/>countries. Cohort-specific patterns varied also by field of study: whilst earlier cohorts in any fields, aside <lb/>from agriculture, were much more likely to stay than the reference group of biology-graduates, this pattern <lb/>was reversed for the 2000s cohort, suggesting that conditions for biologists in the USA must have <lb/>improved relative to those for graduates in other fields. Kim et al. (2011) also showed that staying <lb/>behaviour is partially influenced by financial aspects: being funded as research or teaching assistant during <lb/>the doctoral studies increased the likelihood of staying afterwards substantially compared to being self-<lb/>reliant. On the other hand, receiving a fellowship and employer or foreign government financial support <lb/>lowered the staying probability significantly. <lb/>116. <lb/>Van Bouwel (2010) provided some descriptive evidence of factors affecting the locational <lb/>choice of Europeans regarding the first job after graduation from doctoral studies in the US and a later <lb/>career stage. The author explained that staying is more frequently chosen in later cohorts. Like Kim et al. <lb/>(2011), she also highlighted the relevance of the funding source: those who chose to stay were less likely to <lb/>be funded by an institution in the country of origin. Furthermore, stayers were much less likely to focus on <lb/>a research topic related to Europe in their dissertation, but more likely to be involved in an US-specific <lb/>topic. It can be concluded that providing funding and supporting host country-specific research topics <lb/>might foster graduates attachment to a host country. <lb/>117. <lb/>In a follow-up study, Van Bouwel and Veugelers (2012) investigated determinants of staying <lb/>decisions of European doctoral students in the US incorporating scientific output measures. In addition to <lb/>confirming the basic previous findings, they found a strong positive effect of funding by the host institution <lb/>on the likelihood of staying after graduation. Additionally, being in a highly productive or supportive <lb/>research environment, indicated by existence or impact of early publications, encouraged European <lb/>graduates to stay. Conditioning on institutional quality or reputation, high-ability graduates chose high-<lb/>quality institutions for their first job in general, preferably in the host country, but also in the source <lb/>country over institutions with lower reputation. In this context, linguistic or cultural similarity seemed to <lb/>affect staying behaviour once again, since graduates from English-speaking countries were much more <lb/>likely to stay, irrespective of institutional reputation. <lb/></body>

			<body>118. <lb/>The entrenchment of doctoral students with their country of study was also highlighted by <lb/>OECD (2014). International PhD graduates were found to be significantly more likely to remain in Norway <lb/>after graduation, as were those who started a family. A further interesting finding was that having worked <lb/>during studies in a field related to the field of post-graduation employment increased the likelihood of <lb/>staying. Such job opportunities during studies might have served as entrance ticket to the labour market, <lb/>e.g. either by granting more direct access to job networks or by providing more country and occupation <lb/>specific human capital. <lb/>119. <lb/>Reconstructing the careers of Chinese scientists in the field of mathematics, physics, chemistry <lb/>and biology, Tian (2013) investigated possible determinants of return for those with a foreign doctoral <lb/>degree from an English-speaking country. Based on a sample of 159 foreign degree holders (the small size <lb/>is due to the biographical identification procedure of scientists&apos; career history), the only highly significant <lb/>determinant of return is the quality of the respective institution at which someone earned her or his <lb/>doctorate. Compared to the reference group of higher education institutions in the lower six deciles of the <lb/>Academic Ranking of World Universities (&apos;Shanghai Ranking&apos;), those with degree from the top decile <lb/>were six times as likely to stay abroad, those from third to fourth decile still four times as likely to choose a <lb/>career path abroad. This is an indication that institutional quality, e.g. research strength and reputation, <lb/>may affect job market success and thus staying decisions of international graduates who chose an academic <lb/>or research track. <lb/>120. <lb/>Using a unique combination of data from population, employment and educational institution <lb/>registers, Vasiljeva (2014) evaluated determinants of EU and EEA post-graduate students&apos; decision to stay <lb/>at least four years in Denmark after the 2004 EU enlargement. She concluded that the smaller the nominal <lb/>wage gap between source and host country, the more inclined students were to stay in Denmark in the <lb/>medium-run. Students from Southern or Western Europe were also more likely to stay than those from <lb/>Scandinavian countries. Unemployment and social security differentials between the country of origin and <lb/>Denmark did not play a significant role in explaining students&apos; staying decisions. Accounting for cultural <lb/>dimensions, students from countries with a higher acceptance for masculinity dominance 28 displayed a <lb/>higher preference for staying in Denmark. At the same time, male students from countries with higher <lb/>acceptance for power inequality were found to be less inclined towards staying – most likely as they <lb/>perceive that there might be more opportunities for them in their country of origin. In contrast to other <lb/>authors&apos; findings, Vasiljeva (2014) showed inequality in the home country to be positively related to <lb/>staying probabilities whilst linguistic similarity exhibited no explanatory power at all 29 . <lb/>121. <lb/>Some common findings can be derived from this literature review. The most obvious is that the <lb/>majority evolved around a discussion of staying behaviour in the US, a very large English-speaking <lb/>economy with a tertiary education sector attracting many international students. Most European countries <lb/>have very different labour markets from the US, even ignoring the language factor. Regarding staying <lb/>patterns of international graduates in the EU, literature provides only determinants for the Netherlands, <lb/>Norway or Denmark. <lb/>122. <lb/>Nevertheless, there are a number of common determinants of international graduate stay rates. <lb/>Women tend to be more inclined towards staying in the chosen country of destination. Forming social ties, <lb/>e.g. marriage, fosters the willingness to stay – so does a longer time spent in the host country. Both factors <lb/>contribute to a higher attachment to the destination country. The latter leads to a larger degree of <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">28 <lb/>measured by Hofstede&apos;s Masculinity vs. Femininity Index <lb/>29 <lb/>As the author indicated, this outcome may be driven by the fact that the &quot; language proximity variable <lb/>mainly accounts for the effect of neighbouring Scandinavian countries which score high on this index &quot; <lb/>(Vasiljeva, 2014, p. 16). <lb/></note>

			<body>familiarisation with a country&apos;s cultural peculiarities, contributing also to the formation of country-specific <lb/>human capital, which in turn facilities labour market entry in a host country. <lb/>123. <lb/>International graduates base their decisions whether to stay or to return also on perceived <lb/>chances: if they assume job opportunities, i.e. skill-specific wages to be relatively higher in the home <lb/>country, or if the wealth differential between source and host country is not in favour of the host country, <lb/>they tend to return. But if they expect to run into social or political impediments, lowering their perceived <lb/>opportunities in a country of origin, they show a preference for staying. <lb/>124. <lb/>Regarding the staying behaviour of doctoral students and scientists, especially the attractiveness <lb/>of the research environment and the funding source during their post-graduate studies is pivotal: the better <lb/>and stimulating working conditions were the less willing are those individuals to lose such benefits by <lb/>turning their back on the destination country. <lb/>125. <lb/>Thus, the central conclusion to be drawn is that international graduates do not decide lightly <lb/>where they start their career after graduation. Instead, they stay if they consider a destination to be a <lb/>country of social and economic opportunities, as other types of migrants do as well. <lb/></body>

			<body>4 WHAT MAKES INTERNATIONAL GRADUATES STAY IN THE EU: INVESTIGATING <lb/>DETERMINANTS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS&apos; POST-GRADUATION RESIDENCE <lb/>CHOICES <lb/>126. <lb/>This chapter is dedicated to empirically investigating the staying behaviour of international <lb/>graduates in the EU member states. The chosen econometric approach aims at providing some answers to <lb/>the question what determines international students&apos; stay rates in EU countries? Above insights into <lb/>possible mechanisms and determinants are addressed in an empirical framework, using permit based stay <lb/>rates. Although there are some drawbacks 30 , they offer also a huge advantage compared to the tested <lb/>alternatives: a substantial sample size of bilateral stay rates in 2012, ranging from 783 to 2107 <lb/>observations. <lb/>127. <lb/>A brief discussion of these statistics&apos; features and related issues will be given in chapter 4.1. <lb/>Chapter 4.2 lays the foundation for later econometric analysis by highlighting likely mechanisms and <lb/>introducing components which potentially exert an effect on stay rates. The econometric estimation <lb/>method will be presented in chapter 4.3. In chapter 4.4 results from the preferred model specifications will <lb/>be presented and their sensitivity to underlying modelling assumption will be evaluated. <lb/>4.1 About the nature of internationally mobile students&apos; stay rates in the EU <lb/>128. <lb/>Internationally mobile students are not an easy subject to study in a cross-country setup. First, <lb/>as a highly mobile group they are hard to track: Across countries, or even within countries, they are not <lb/>always registered in a comprehensive manner. In particular after graduation, during the transition from <lb/>university to working life, they easily disappear from the records. <lb/>129. <lb/>A second issue is the existence of various definitions or recording procedures in different <lb/>countries. Some compile information on internationally mobile students using the resident concept others <lb/>rely on the national concept. Additionally, the data may vary regarding the level of aggregation: some <lb/>countries report only aggregate figures for all incoming students whilst others itemise them by country of <lb/>origin. Most of the data on internationally mobile students in the EU is stock data which cannot be linked <lb/>to any individual characteristics. This drawback can be partially remedied by evaluating staying behaviour <lb/>of individuals included in the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS); yet, this too comes at a price. <lb/>130. <lb/>For the purpose of a cross-country assessment of staying behaviour of internationally mobile <lb/>students in the EU the previously mentioned hitches impose substantial analytical challenges. There is no <lb/>single perfect statistic identifying post-graduation mobility patterns in this group over all 28 EU member <lb/>states in a truly comparable and perfectly reliable manner. Instead, the statistic of choice depends on the <lb/>specific angle of a research question. For instance, the required statistic in an econometric analysis of <lb/>origin-specific stay rates for all member states should display different features then the statistic used to <lb/>evaluate labour market outcomes of internationally mobile students, respectively graduates. <lb/>131. <lb/>As integral part of this research, several alternative statistics have been derived and compared in <lb/>an exploratory study part, found in the extended version of this paper (Weisser, 2015a). Detailed <lb/>information regarding their construction is provided there and the resulting statistics are contrasted in light <lb/>of their advantages and limitations. The following subchapter only provides a brief overview of stay rates <lb/>used for subsequent econometric analysis. <lb/>30 <lb/>Methodological issues are discussed at length in the extended version of this paper. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.1.1 Construction of stay rates <lb/>132. <lb/>The three relevant permit based stay rates are: í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°´,µí°´, í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 , and í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ .While all of them <lb/>identify those who stayed using permit status changes (from education to another permit category), each <lb/>was constructed using a different denominator. Stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°´derivesµí°´derives the population of internationally <lb/>mobile graduates as the total number of those who relinquish education-related permit status. This <lb/>population proxy, however, has to be recovered from a demographic equality, based on changes in stock <lb/>data and new permits since the required figure is not in the data. Several drawbacks are associated: permits <lb/>for education reasons are not exclusively issued for those enrolled in tertiary education, and for available <lb/>data the demographic equality does not always allow recovering plausible population proxies for all <lb/>countries and periods. The latter problem can be circumvented using past inflows, recorded as newly <lb/>issued education permits in a previous period, to generate a proxy for the population in the denominator <lb/>and match the respective cohort to present status changers (the stayers). Several time horizons have been <lb/>evaluated, accordingly to usual durations of a study programme.

For example by far the <lb/>highest stay rate on the aggregate EU-level is displayed by internationally mobile students from Armenia <lb/>(79.5%). A high tendency to stay in the EU can also be observed for students from Northern and Western <lb/>Africa, some South-East Asian countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States. These patterns can <lb/>be seen as hints towards potential determinants of staying behaviour, such as economic development or <lb/>historical relations. <lb/>31 <lb/>corresponding to a three year bachelor programme <lb/>32 <lb/>For the United Kingdom stock data series only contained values from 2012, therefore it had frequently to <lb/>be excluded from stay rates&apos; analysis. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.2 Explaining stay rates: explanatory components and data sources <lb/>136. <lb/>As the previous section has demonstrated, observed bilateral stay rates are highly specific to the <lb/>examined country pairs, and to a certain extent to the calculation method. The chosen analytical strategy <lb/>thus accommodates these facts by focusing on country-related features and applying the econometric <lb/>estimation procedure to all three types of stay rates. <lb/>137. <lb/>The basic idea is to evaluate the impact of various specific features of source country í µí± and <lb/>destination country í µí± on the respective bilateral stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± . Within the analysis of these aggregate <lb/>pairwise stay rates three different types of influential factors will be considered 33 : <lb/>1. Time constant features of host country í µí± (í µí»¿ í µí± ) which affect students from all non-EU countries <lb/>during the time horizon in a similar manner, e.g. cultural or climatic aspects of the host country. <lb/>2. Specific pairwise time-constant factors (í µí± í µí±í µí± ), e.g. sharing a common language or having historical <lb/>ties. <lb/>3. Potentially time-varying factors (í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ ), such as economic conditions, social aspects or legal <lb/>frameworks, encompassing composite indicators: Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and <lb/>Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). <lb/>4.3 Estimating determinants: econometric methodology <lb/>138. <lb/>All three types of bilateral stay rates introduced in chapter 4.1 (í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°´,µí°´, í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 , and í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ <lb/>1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ ) <lb/>have been incorporated into two different modelling approaches. The first one, based on Papke and <lb/>Wooldridge (1996) can be applied if one assumes that zero stay rates and positive stay rates originate from <lb/>a common process, and the analytical focus rests on the stay rates&apos; conditional mean. However, if stay rates <lb/>are not the result of one single, but two sequential processes, a two-part estimation in the sense of Ramalho <lb/>et al. (2011) might be appropriate. The first part is a binary zero-one response: either there are no stayers at <lb/>all or there is some positive number, yielding a non-zero stay rate. The second part consists of a fractional <lb/>response estimation for those cases with stay rates larger than zero 34 . <lb/>4.4 Determinants of bilateral stay rates: empirical results <lb/>139. <lb/>Since model selection procedures (see Table A. 6 to Table A. 11) indicated that all other link <lb/>functions are more frequently rejected than the complementary loglog link function, the subsequent part is <lb/>dedicated to the discussion of the one-and two-part specifications applying this specific type of link <lb/>function. <lb/>140. <lb/>Table 6 shows the outcomes for the most preferred specification relying on the Global <lb/>Competitiveness Index. For all the three stay rates the respective results from the one-part and fractional <lb/>part of a two-part model are reported. The latter shows results for the subset of non-zero bilateral stay <lb/>rates, hence it accounts for the possibility that there might be in fact two distinct processes as discussed in <lb/>chapter 4.3. <lb/>141. <lb/>Due to the construction of stay rates as averages (typically 2010 to 2012), and for the sake of <lb/>model parsimoniousness, GDP per capita differences, unemployment and competitiveness differences <lb/>33 Further discussion on these components is included in the extended version of this paper. <lb/>34 Derivation of both models is explained in the extended version of this paper. <lb/></body>

			<body>entered the model as three year averages as well 35 . The &apos;diaspora effect&apos; incorporates potential network <lb/>effects with the corresponding variable being the share of migrants 36 from country í µí± living in a destination <lb/>country í µí± over the total population. This share can be interpreted as proxy for the likelihood of meeting <lb/>someone from the same country of origin – hence as probability of benefitting from potential diaspora <lb/>network effects. <lb/>142. <lb/>The implementation of differentials between destination country (DC) and country of origin <lb/>(OC) was a result of two arguments. First, the degree of precision increased substantially when destination <lb/>country controls have been introduced (see appendix). This was mainly due to an improved estimation for <lb/>observations at the lower bound of zero. An immediate consequence is that variables at the destination <lb/>country level display perfect colinearity with these country controls and thus cannot be used anymore in <lb/>the cross-section sample. <lb/>143. <lb/>The second consideration refers to the underlying decision-making process of individuals. As <lb/>previously mentioned, perceived opportunities will most likely govern the process whether to stay or to <lb/>return on an individual level. If an international graduate arrives at the conclusion that her living standard <lb/>will probably be higher in the destination country, she would be more inclined towards staying. Such <lb/>comparisons can be accounted for on the aggregate level by using differences whilst perfect colinearity <lb/>poses no longer an issue. <lb/>144. <lb/>Testing the model&apos;s specification by usage of a generalised goodness of functional form test <lb/>(GGOFF, Ramalho et al., 2014), suitable to detect symmetric and asymmetric misspecification alike, <lb/>supported the complementary loglog specification clearly in favour of symmetric ones, i.e. logit or probit. <lb/>Parallel conducted RESET-tests yielded also results in favour of the complementary loglog fractional <lb/>modelling approach. Direct model comparisons of one-and two-part specifications, using a P-test <lb/>(Davidson and MacKinnon, 1981; results not reported), lead to varying preferences depending on the <lb/>dependent variable and set of explanatory variables. Overall results insinuate a weak preference for the <lb/>two-part specifications. <lb/>145. <lb/>For all three different stay rates to be investigated, some common results can be derived from <lb/>the GCI specification: bilateral time-invariant factors play a predominant role. If destination and source <lb/>country share a common official language the stay rate is between 3.7 and 6.3 percentage points higher for <lb/>students from such a country of origin. The effect of colonial ties after 1945 is similarly pronounced but <lb/>less frequently significant. The impact of distance is also non-negligible. If the distance between capitals <lb/>was to increase by one percent beyond 1000 kilometres 37 observed stay rates decline on average by 0.61 to <lb/>0.84 percentage points. <lb/>35 <lb/>Alternative specifications including lagged differences have been tested. These yielded neither substantial <lb/>changes in other variables estimated coefficients nor in additional robust insights into the dynamic <lb/>influence of GDP per capita or unemployment differentials. <lb/>36 <lb/>The stock of migrants is based on the OECD&apos;s DIOC database 2010 and has been restricted to those being <lb/>at least 35 years old. The restriction has been adopted to limit the likelihood that the derived share of <lb/>migrants includes also internationally mobile students whose numbers are actually an integral part of the <lb/>stay rate to be explained. <lb/>37 <lb/>Average marginal effects &apos;dy/ex&apos; have the interpretation of semi-elasticities. Since marginal effects are not <lb/>constant, but depending on the reference distance, reported results referring to a specific value deliver a <lb/>more precise picture. Alternative specifications accounted for non-linearities as well. The quadratic <lb/>distance showed up to be insignificant. <lb/></body>

			<body>perspectives in their country of origin even when the general unemployment rate is higher than in the <lb/>destination country, if for example they offered a scarce and highly valued skill portfolio (e.g. international <lb/>experience or specific technical knowledge not widely spread in the source country).Regarding aspects of <lb/>competitiveness, two remarkable facts emerge. First, international graduates seem to display a certain <lb/>preference for destination countries with more developed institutions: stay rates rise by 3.2 to 7.8 <lb/>percentage points if the average score differential of the GCI&apos;s first pillar is at least one standard deviation <lb/>above the mean. Second, if a country of origin scores distinctly higher compared to a destination country in <lb/>the pillar &apos;innovations&apos;, observed stay rates decline by 4 to 8.5 percentage points. Staying behaviour would <lb/>thus respond to improved innovativeness and a focus on a technological pioneering role in the country of <lb/>study. <lb/>149. <lb/>There is also an indication that stay rates for students from larger economies (market size) are <lb/>smaller. Possibly, they expect to have a larger variety of opportunities in their home economy. In a similar <lb/>fashion, distinctly higher scores in the infrastructure pillar of a country of origin are associated with lower <lb/>stay rates as well. <lb/>150. <lb/>The following table presents average marginal effects obtained using the governance <lb/>specifications (WGI). The results are highly consistent with respect to time-constant bilateral components <lb/>and economic differentials, measured by GDP per capita and unemployment rate differences (Table 7). <lb/>151. <lb/>Furthermore, the diaspora effect seems to be robust across almost all specifications. If the share <lb/>of migrants from a specific country of origin increases from 0.1 to 0.101 percent 39 , observed stay rates tend <lb/>to be higher by 0.95 to 2.8 percentage points. <lb/>152. <lb/>Average WGI score differentials have been constructed in accordance with the 90 percent <lb/>confidence intervals from Kaufmann et al. (2010) 40 . The aspect of &apos;government effectiveness&apos; bears across <lb/>all types of stay rates and model specifications significant explanatory power: if a destination country <lb/>scores on average always significantly above a country of origin, stay rates are between 4.8 and 8.7 <lb/>percentage points higher; if the country of origin performs better in this regard, stay rates are typically 10 <lb/>to 11.4 percent smaller. All six specifications thus point to the fact that international graduates have a <lb/>certain preference to settle in the country which has more effective government and better public services. <lb/>153. <lb/>Similarly, if a source country scores on average better in the domain of &apos;voice and <lb/>accountability&apos;, the average staying likelihood decreases by 13.6 to 16.1 percentage points 41 . <lb/>39 <lb/>Respective shares have a mean of 0.04 percent and a maximum of 10 percent. The chosen reference value <lb/>of 0.1 percent was already in the highest decile. <lb/>40 <lb/>&apos;DC&gt;OC&apos; indicates that the average score difference for the years 2010 to 2012 was always positive whilst <lb/>the 90% confidence intervals of both countries&apos; scores were always non-overlapping. This implies that the <lb/>resulting difference is in fact significant. The reference category for the WGI differential indicator consists <lb/>of those observations which displayed in at least one year an insignificant score differential. Based on the <lb/>indicators distribution it can be concluded that country-pairs in the reference group displayed a comparably <lb/>high degree of similarity in the specific domain. <lb/>41 <lb/>The positive marginal effect for SR 1A highlights the issue associated with much smaller sample size and a <lb/>reduced set of involved countries. <lb/></body>

Additional information in the lower segment originates from the estimation of the <lb/>underlying model with a complementary loglog link function. &apos;DC&gt;OC&apos; represents a dummy category, indicating that the variables&apos; <lb/>value is distinctly (significantly) larger in the destination country, and &apos;OC&gt;DC&apos; vice-versa.

GDP per capita, <lb/>unemployment rate and GCI pillar score differences entered as three year averages. <lb/>154. <lb/>For stay rates derived based on method 1B, the dimensions &apos;political stability and the absence <lb/>of violence&apos; as well as &apos;rule of law&apos; reveal significant correlations with the expected sign. Yet, some <lb/>marginal effects are larger in magnitude or become significant only in the two-part specification, for <lb/>instance derived average marginal effects for &apos;rule of law&apos;. This can be seen as an argument for the <lb/>existence of two distinct processes governing the likelihood of observing a positive stay rate at all and then <lb/>the relative size of stayers&apos; population. <lb/>155. <lb/>Taken together, these findings suggest that participation opportunities in general, stability and <lb/>reliability may influence staying decision. <lb/>156. <lb/>Both modelling approaches, the competitiveness and the governance specification, lead to <lb/>similar conclusions: Some persistent factors, e.g. historical links or linguistic similarities, are likely to <lb/>influence staying behaviour heavily. Time-dependent aspects, such as per capita income, referring to <lb/>wealth level differentials between destination and source country might only be partially relevant. <lb/>Economic differentials might tip the scales, but are not necessarily major determinants on an aggregate <lb/>level. Well educated and globally mobile international students are likely to find their niche in most <lb/>economies. <lb/>157. <lb/>Furthermore, findings on the aggregate level suggest that staying decisions are indeed linked to <lb/>an assessment of individual opportunities. Those countries seen as more innovative are more attractive to <lb/>international graduates. Institutional quality and the quality of political processes are plausible <lb/>determinants of stay rates too. Just like other migrants, international students and graduates opt for a career <lb/>start in the respective country offering more opportunities whilst providing an institutional environment <lb/>suitable to sustain these prospects. <lb/></body>

			<body>5 CONSEQUENCES OF POST-GRADUATION STAYING BEHAVIOUR ON EUROPEAN <lb/>ECONOMIES <lb/>158. <lb/>Post-graduation mobility decisions of international students, i.e. the choice where they start <lb/>their careers, clearly have important economic consequences. Aside from the mere question in which <lb/>country they enter the labour market, their successful integration is relevant too. If their integration into a <lb/>host country&apos;s labour force proves difficult, not only public acceptance of tertiary educated labour migrants <lb/>might suffer but the economy would incur a loss as well -through a waste of international graduate <lb/>stayers&apos; potential and skills. <lb/>159. <lb/>Aside from labour market related consequences, staying behaviour of international graduates <lb/>has implications with respect to fiscal policy too. There might be plausible arguments linking the costs of <lb/>providing education to international students and their post-graduation migration patterns. Beyond this, the <lb/>ramifications of changing stay rates on other policy domains should be considered as well. <lb/>5.1 Labour market related consequences <lb/>160. <lb/>The integration of international graduate stayers into the labour market will be evaluated based <lb/>on descriptive statistics, derived from the EU-LFS. Available data, for most of the presented statistics, <lb/>allows a distinction between EU and third country national stayers. This entails the opportunity to evaluate <lb/>the degree of substitutability between these two distinct types of stayers. <lb/>161. <lb/>This empirical examination is followed by a brief discussion of possible consequences of a shift <lb/>in the tertiary educated labour supply, induced by an increasing stay rate of international students and <lb/>graduates. <lb/>5.1.1 Labour market outcomes of stayers -LFS <lb/>162. <lb/>Regarding labour market integration and outcomes of international student stayers 42 the EU-<lb/>LFS provides valuable insights. A direct comparison of stayers to their native peers (domestic graduate <lb/>stayers), which graduated in the same year, allows a more in-depth analysis of employment outcomes in <lb/>general but also with respect to sectorial differences or other distinguishing characteristics. <lb/>163. <lb/>International graduates are just as successful regarding their labour market entrance as domestic <lb/>graduates: one year after graduation there is no significant difference between the employment status of <lb/>domestic graduate stayers and international graduate stayers 43 . <lb/>164. <lb/>International graduate stayers (10.9%) do not face larger risks of being unemployed than their <lb/>domestic peers (11.6 %). However, one should bear in mind that these international stayers might be <lb/>positively selected, with skills in high demand, whilst international graduates who failed to find a job or <lb/>who saw dim employment prospects already left the country. <lb/>165. <lb/>International graduate stayers have a higher likelihood of receiving part-time contracts. This <lb/>result is to a large extent driven by stayers from third countries, especially female graduates. There <lb/>emerges also a noticeable difference regarding income deciles: international stayers have a slightly lower <lb/>probability of reaching the two highest deciles and a higher probability of being in the lowest two deciles. <lb/>The observed differences are not however significant at conventional levels. <lb/>42 <lb/>Stayers are identified following the concept SR3, illustrated shortly in chapter 4.1. <lb/>43 <lb/>The large share of inactive individuals is for EU graduate stayers, and especially for domestic graduates, <lb/>mainly driven by those who are studying on or who are in further training after their first degree. <lb/></body>

			<body>168. <lb/>The preferred locational choice of international graduate stayers deviates clearly from domestic <lb/>stayers&apos; preferences. Third country graduate stayers, and even more so EU graduate stayers, prefer densely <lb/>populated areas over intermediate or more rural ones. <lb/>169. <lb/>Overall, international graduate stayers perform comparably well regarding the integration into a <lb/>country&apos;s labour force. But as this brief analysis indicates, graduate stayers preferences and national or <lb/>regional labour market needs do not necessarily coincide. International graduate stayers seem little inclined <lb/>to reside outside of metropolitan areas, nor do they currently show signs of more pronounced preferences <lb/>for a career in STEM fields (science, mathematics and computing or engineering, manufacturing and <lb/>construction) or the area of health and welfare. <lb/>5.1.2 On the nexus of stay rates and skilled labour supply shifts <lb/>170. <lb/>The question regarding a likely impact of a supply shift of tertiary educated labour on labour <lb/>market outcomes for involved groups is an ample field of research in itself. This paragraph thus can neither <lb/>provide a comprehensive overview over the state of current research nor can it present detailed empirical <lb/>results. It serves merely to spotlight three relevant aspects in the nexus of international graduates&apos; staying <lb/>behaviour and labour market outcomes: permanence of supply shifts, the impact on wage levels and <lb/>employment, and the unemployment of younger cohorts of tertiary educated labour. <lb/>171. <lb/>Every international graduate who decides to stay in the country of graduation (or the EU) <lb/>contributes to a marginal supply shift of tertiary educated labour. Abstracting from all other effects of such <lb/>a supply shift, there still remains the question concerning the aspect of permanence: is an international <lb/>graduate&apos;s decision to stay final or only part of a qualification process which increases human capital <lb/>further before returning? <lb/>172. <lb/>Literature provides some direct information regarding staying behaviour of internationally <lb/>mobile graduates in a more dynamic context. For instance Finn (2012) reported for foreign PhD-holders in <lb/>the USA five year stay rates which declined by eight percentage points on average compared to short-term <lb/>rates. This decrease holds also for graduates in computer sciences and engineering, and it is even more <lb/>pronounced for physical science and mathematics. <lb/>173. <lb/>Similarly, figures presented by Van Bouwel (2010) pointed to a decrease of five to eight <lb/>percentage points, depending on the source region of European PhD-holders graduating in the USA. For <lb/>Denmark, Ministeriet for Forskning (2013) showed stay rates of international students three years after <lb/>graduation to be six percentage points lower than after the first year. <lb/>174. <lb/>Unsurprisingly, staying behaviour of internationally mobile students might only be temporary. <lb/>Whilst some came initially to stay for good, others aimed at gathering some working experience and <lb/>collect then the additional skill premium in a different labour market. As the previous chapter indicated, <lb/>short-run stayers are likely to be positively selected, this might also hold true for sequential staying <lb/>decisions in the medium-or long-run. <lb/>175. <lb/>Nevertheless, the cohort of those who chose to stay at first will shrink over time, even in the so-<lb/>called STEM-fields which are typically mentioned in the context of alleged skill-shortages. If international <lb/>graduates are sought to alleviate the impact of this kind of stated friction, it has to be kept in mind that only <lb/>a fraction will be there to fulfil this role in the long-run. They are highly-skilled and have already proven to <lb/>be highly mobile as well, so in the end, some of them will only be temporary migrants and not permanently <lb/>provide their talent to the EU. <lb/>176. <lb/>Turning to the second aspect, namely the connection between changing staying patterns and <lb/>wages, one could try to infer whether status quo and recent wage trends might be conducive to a desired <lb/></body>

			<body>expansion of tertiary educated labour supply. Although purely monetary motives are not necessarily <lb/>pivotal regarding staying decisions of international graduates, comparably higher wages at career start after <lb/>graduation might nevertheless increase someone&apos;s inclination towards staying. On an aggregate level, this <lb/>could then result in a broadening of tertiary educated labour supply. <lb/>Figure 11.

			<body>177. <lb/>Figure 11 depicts the changes between 2002 and 2010 in hourly average real wages of high-<lb/>skilled employees for three different sectorial aggregates. The sample has been restricted to those below 30 <lb/>years of age to represent the entry ages after university graduation. <lb/>178. <lb/>In almost all EU member states which acceded in the 2004 enlargement, average real wages <lb/>surged. This can be attributed to a large extent to a catching-up process, since in 2010 the average hourly <lb/>wages are still clearly below the wages in the old EU member states. <lb/>179. <lb/>Most of the older EU member states experienced moderate real wage increases for young <lb/>professionals. However, some of them welcomed high-skilled labour market entrants with decreasing real <lb/>wages, with the United Kingdom leading the way. Here, &quot; each cohort of graduates since the financial crisis <lb/>is earning less than the one before &quot; . &quot; New graduates who earned £15,000 or more in 2011-12 – enough to <lb/>start repaying their loans – were paid on average 12 per cent less in real terms than graduates at the same <lb/>stage of their careers in 2007-08 &quot; (Financial Times, 2013). <lb/>180. <lb/>For the EU as a whole, the picture looks similar: across all high-skilled occupations, real wages <lb/>declined between 2002 and 2010 by 6.9 to 34.3 percent. This is not exclusively a result to the financial <lb/>crisis: between 2002 and 2006 young professionals employed in the field of &apos;Education; human health and <lb/>social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; other service activities&apos; benefitted from a real <lb/>average wage growth of 4.4 percent – while young high-skilled workers in the remaining eight groups <lb/>experienced a decline of average real wages of 1.5 to 17.4 percent. <lb/>181. <lb/>Real wage developments for young high-skilled professionals in the EU 15 raise doubt on the <lb/>existence of a general labour shortage concerning high-skilled employees. Beyond, partly declining <lb/>average real wages for this group will neither increase enrolment in tertiary education in general, nor <lb/>improve the EU&apos;s retention capability with respect to international graduates. Instead, this adverse <lb/>development suggests a relatively weaker demand for tertiary educated or high-skilled labour at an early <lb/>career stage in the EU in the period examined. <lb/>182. <lb/>The third aspect to be briefly highlighted are employment perspectives for internationally <lb/>mobile graduates with respect to their risk of being unemployed. As previously shown, those who stayed <lb/>upon graduation have almost identical unemployment rates than their domestic peers. This suggests that <lb/>the sample of stayers is affected by a country&apos;s general labour market conditions in a similar manner as <lb/>nationals. These general conditions have worsened from 2008 onwards on a broad scale. In most of the EU <lb/>countries, tertiary educated (ISCED 5 and 6) individuals below age 40 faced in 2013 a much higher <lb/>likelihood of being unemployed than they did five years ago (see Figure 12). <lb/>183. <lb/>This adverse labour market environment was especially harsh for the age cohorts 20 to 24 and <lb/>25 to 29 years, which is the typical age at which someone graduates from university. The unemployment <lb/>rate of the youngest graduates reached 18.8 percent in 2013, for those aged 25 to 29 it was at 10.7 percent <lb/>still the highest value since this series has been introduced. This general trend is also mirrored in some <lb/>anecdotal evidence, highlighting that even a costly university education is no longer a guarantee for a <lb/>smooth labour market entry: the top 100 employers in the UK offered in 2014 nine percent fewer graduate <lb/>vacancies than before the crisis (Financial Times, 2013). <lb/>184. <lb/>Under the currently prevailing circumstances in most EU countries, higher stay rates or <lb/>especially higher absolute numbers of stayers would most likely not contribute to improving the labour <lb/>market situation for tertiary educated entrants. This is also true in light of the fact that stayers&apos; fields of <lb/>graduation are not significantly different from those of their domestic peers -hence they offer a similar <lb/>portfolio of qualification and skills. Taking recent years&apos; unemployment trends and the similarity of <lb/></body>

			<body>international and domestic graduates into account, any first-glance impression of those two types of <lb/>graduates being substitutes cannot be easily dismissed. If international graduates are supposed to <lb/>strengthen the economic position of EU member states by providing their skills and talents, the general <lb/>environment which enables them to do so should be improved. <lb/>Figure 12. EU 28 unemployment rates for tertiary educated, by age <lb/>Source: Eurostat, EU-LFS data <lb/>185. <lb/>What are the general conclusion regarding the nexus of staying behaviour of international <lb/>graduates and skilled labour supply shifts? Current labour market conditions, thus unemployment rates and <lb/>remuneration trends, indicate relatively poor conditions for labour market entrants after graduation on the <lb/>aggregate EU level. With some exceptions, international graduates are now facing in most EU countries <lb/>less favourable labour market conditions than five to ten years ago. This in turn might translate into lower <lb/>stay rates in the short-or medium term as highly-skilled and internationally mobile graduates attribute a <lb/>dwindling attractiveness to the EU labour markets. <lb/>186. <lb/>In addition, graduate stayers&apos; initial study preferences are similar to those of domestic students. <lb/>Hence it is rather unlikely that higher numbers of stayers translate immediately into substantially higher <lb/>numbers of qualified job applicants in STEM occupations, especially in non-metropolitan areas. The <lb/>underlying issue, a mismatch between applicants&apos; study or location preferences and employers&apos; demands, <lb/>cannot be eradicated by unselective retention of international graduates. <lb/>5.2 General fiscal and demand-related implications of graduates&apos; staying behaviour <lb/>187. <lb/>Labour market outcomes of international graduate stayers have shown that stayers display an <lb/>employment rate at least as high as the native comparison group. Such high shares regarding stayers&apos; <lb/>participation indicate that they constitute a relevant part of the highly skilled labour force. <lb/>188. <lb/>If, furthermore, a host country has a high demand for tertiary educated labour, which cannot be <lb/>satisfied by domestic supply, international graduate stayers&apos; labour supply will be complementary. Hence, <lb/>any additional graduate stayer would marginally contribute to an expansion of the host country&apos;s output -<lb/>and as employee to an increasing income tax base alike. <lb/>189. <lb/>Moreover, these stayers display an unemployment rate similar to domestic graduates or below, <lb/>hence they typically do not pose a burden to social security systems: amongst those graduates who one <lb/>year after graduation are unemployed or inactive, 5.4 percent of domestic graduates and 5.1 percent of all <lb/>international graduate stayers receive benefits or assistance. Restricting the sample to third country <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 <lb/></note>

			<page>54 <lb/></page>

			<body>nationals who stay, 97.1 percent of unemployed or inactive stayers do not receive any social benefits or <lb/>assistance whilst the same holds true for only 94.6 percent of domestic graduates. The design of social <lb/>security benefits or assistance, most likely eligibility criteria, and the high employment rate of international <lb/>stayers ensure that international stayers are from a relative point of view a lesser burden to EU social <lb/>systems than domestic graduates. <lb/>190. <lb/>International graduate stayers who are unemployed or inactive do still consume in the chosen <lb/>country of residence, thus they contribute to the demand for commodity goods. This plausibly results in a <lb/>marginal contribution to the respective country&apos;s GDP. At the same time, by means of value added <lb/>commodity good and service taxation, they further contribute to municipal or governmental revenues. <lb/>191. <lb/>If one extends the time horizon to comprise also periods prospective international graduates are <lb/>still enrolled at university, the consumption argument holds of course already during studies. Vossensteyn <lb/>et al. (2013) quote for example a weekly consumption level of 500 Australian Dollar for international <lb/>students in Australia. They also report that international students in Canada spent in 2010 more than 7.7 <lb/>billion Dollars for tuition fees, accommodation and discretionary spending. NAFSA (2013) provides <lb/>figures regarding the economic relevance of international students in the US: international students and <lb/>their dependents contributed in the academic year 2012/2013 approximately 24 billion US-$ to the US <lb/>economy and supported 313,000 jobs. For the UK, international students&apos; contribution to the economy is <lb/>assumed to be in the range of 12.5 billion British Pound. Over and above, &quot; for every ten international <lb/>students, three full time equivalent jobs are created in the UK &quot; (House of Commons, 2011, p. 8). <lb/>192. <lb/>Taken these facts together, the average graduate stayer can be expected to become already in <lb/>the short-run not only a consumer, adding to internal demand, but also a fiscal net-contributor. <lb/>5.3 Funding of higher education and internationally mobile students <lb/>193. <lb/>Before international stayers can contribute to a host country&apos;s economic prosperity after <lb/>graduation, they already constitute a part of the overall demand for tertiary education. For a couple of <lb/>countries, this fraction amounts to more than ten percent of total enrolment (see Table A. 2). This has <lb/>further fiscal implications regarding the funding of higher education. <lb/>194. <lb/>Some countries, for instance the UK, charge higher tuition fees from non-EU students. Others, <lb/>aside from administrative fees, provide access to higher education for all students free of tuition fees. The <lb/>first group of countries not only manages to recover marginal costs of providing tertiary education to a <lb/>third country student but also to lessen fiscal restrictions regarding the funding of higher education <lb/>institutions in general. In fact, this might even result in a successful sort of cross-subsidising tertiary <lb/>education for domestic students 44 by attracting international students (Findlay, 2011, p. 178). In the <lb/>absence of capacity constraints, any additional international student generates an immediate fiscal gain. <lb/>195. <lb/>This outcome is partially efficient since those who benefit personally from a high quality <lb/>education system also shoulder associated costs. On the other hand it might be partially inefficient as well: <lb/>if international fee paying students decide to stay upon graduation, then the host country would benefit <lb/>from a privately funded human capital investment. This kind of positive externality might imply an <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">44 The claim that this is a non-negligible case of cross-subsidising is supported by figures from the <lb/>academic year 2005/2006. According to House of Lords (2008, p. 512), non-EU domiciled students paid <lb/>fees of approximately GBP 1.5 billion, which amounted to 8% of the higher education sector&apos;s total <lb/>funding in the UK. <lb/></note>

			<body>initially too low private investment in education, and the higher the stay rate, the larger the overall impact <lb/>of this externality might become. <lb/>196. <lb/>For the second group of countries, the immediate net effect is not as unambiguous. Accounting <lb/>only for the purely fiscal aspect of funding tertiary education in a short-run, any additional international <lb/>student will lead to a marginal increase of public expenditure. Thus, from a merely fiscal point, if <lb/>consumption levels of international students were low, e.g. due to individual financial constraints, and they <lb/>had complete access to all public services, the governmental budget might incur a net loss due to an <lb/>international student. This however can change in the medium-to long-run, mainly depending on whether <lb/>international students stay after graduation and successfully integrate themselves into the labour force or <lb/>not. Here, the post-graduation stay rates are of key interest. <lb/>197. <lb/>Referring to previous considerations with respect to fiscal or economic net contributions after <lb/>graduation, the higher the stay rate, the faster or more likely previous public expenditures can be <lb/>recovered. Both cases, referring to the extremes of the basic funding alternatives (private versus public), <lb/>lead to the conclusion that an optimal fiscal policy should neither focus exclusively on minimising fiscal <lb/>burden of providing tertiary education to international students nor on maximising subsequently generated <lb/>additional (income) tax revenues. <lb/>198. <lb/>In the presence of highly mobile international graduates, the overall fiscal outcome would not <lb/>only be determined by education policy competition but also by tax competition between host countries. In <lb/>this context, Krieger and Lange (2010) discuss in a fiscal competition model the impact of student and <lb/>labour mobility. They model the mechanisms of interconnected student and graduate mobility on the one <lb/>side and education expenditures and tax rates on the other. Amongst other findings, they establish a <lb/>relationship between international graduates&apos; tax sensitivity and decreasing overall net revenues. This <lb/>effect is mainly driven by a comparative cost advantage when it comes to migration, which allows <lb/>international graduates to leave high taxation countries more easily. This tax base erosion can only <lb/>partially be offset by lowering education expenditure or increasing fees. <lb/>199. <lb/>In an alternative modelling approach Lange (2013) aims at explaining the impact of changing <lb/>stay rates on optimal tuition fees if some net gains already accrue to the host country during international <lb/>students&apos; study period. This was for example the case if costs of tertiary education in relation to students&apos; <lb/>consumption levels were sufficiently low. If international students correctly anticipate, at the time of their <lb/>initial study choice, a low post-graduation staying probability, their demand for tertiary education abroad <lb/>reacts more sensitively to changes in tuition fees. If international students generate public net gains already <lb/>during studies, lowering tuition fees in case of declining stay rates would be the optimal policy. <lb/>200. <lb/>The outcome changes however, if international students had irrational, i.e. overly optimistic <lb/>expectations regarding the possibility to stay. If they assume to be able to reap the benefits from a high <lb/>quality education and favourable labour market outcomes in the host country in any case, their demand for <lb/>foreign education is less elastic with respect to tuition fees. Here, rising tuition fees and simultaneously <lb/>declining stay rates might still increase governments&apos; net revenues. Both approaches provide strong <lb/>arguments in favour of a high importance of international students&apos; choice sensitivity regarding host <lb/>countries tuition fees and expectations regarding post-graduation opportunities. <lb/>201. <lb/>Poutvaara (2008) incorporated the fact that tertiary education may not be equally transferable <lb/>across countries: for example degrees in law may have a rather national relevance, whereas degrees in <lb/>natural sciences should be applicable in an international context – principles of quantum physics do not <lb/>change depending on which side of a border they have been taught, yet paragraphs in fiscal law are likely <lb/>to differ. He established that the national public provision of internationally applicable education, yielding <lb/>positive externalities for other countries as well (due to graduate mobility, fostered e.g. by mobility <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 <lb/></note>

			<page>56 <lb/></page>

			<body>programmes), could remain strictly below a global optimum. A possible suggested solution was the <lb/>introduction of a graduate tax, accruing to the country where a possibly mobile graduate acquired her <lb/>university degree. <lb/>202. <lb/>A further extension was investigated by Delpierre and Verheyden (2014) who addressed also <lb/>quality of provided education and location preferences of graduates. Optimal funding schemes could <lb/>change in the presence of potentially conflicting priorities of universities and governments. Universities <lb/>might engage in competition for (international) students, by raising quality, whilst governments aimed at <lb/>maximising an economy&apos;s output under fiscal competition. Some resulting inefficiencies, e.g. <lb/>underinvestment in human capital if workers are mobile, could be remedied by transnational transfers for <lb/>mobile students. <lb/>203. <lb/>Theoretical models&apos; mechanisms and previously presented empirical evidence underscore the <lb/>economic relevance of international students for a host country. Yet, when it comes to defining policy <lb/>measures regarding international students&apos; enrolment, all associated decisions will be made between <lb/>conflicting priorities of fiscal goals, revenue or output maximising aspects in the short-and long-run, <lb/>socio-political necessities and other policy fields. <lb/>204. <lb/>The complexity of determining an optimal policy (mix) can be easily demonstrated: Higher <lb/>tuition fees for international students might relax short-run fiscal constraints at the cost of lower enrolment <lb/>numbers if students&apos; demand for foreign education is price sensitive. But this in turn might hamper the <lb/>generation of future revenues or economic output, by negatively affecting the overall number of <lb/>prospective stayers <lb/>205. <lb/>Low tuition fees in contrast could be a suitable policy to attract in a first step brains to fuel the <lb/>knowledge economy. If post-graduation stay rates were at the same time low, this might indicate a certain <lb/>degree of free-riding. Yet, if the policy goal was to export higher education -jointly with low or no tuition <lb/>fees at all, this could be seen as part of a host country&apos;s development assistance -low stay rates for <lb/>international students from developing countries would then indicate a rather successful outcome. As it <lb/>happens, achieving this latter goal seems difficult, as there is evidence that even setting quotas, and <lb/>defining scholarship schemes to foster return to developing countries often fail their purpose (Brekke, <lb/>2006; Hein and Plesch, 2008). <lb/>206. <lb/>This chapter prompts the conclusion that any measure directly or indirectly targeting <lb/>international students&apos; stay rates should only be implemented after having clearly defined a country&apos;s <lb/>policy priorities. Increasing stay rates by all means may produce the desired advantageous result in one <lb/>policy domain, but at the same time come at the price of impairment in another field. <lb/></body>

			<body>6 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>207. <lb/>Empirical results from this study, as well as established findings in the migration literature may <lb/>now serve as point of reference for the derivation of policy recommendations. Presented suggestions <lb/>concern two major questions: how to increase the number of stayers -thus stimulate associated positive <lb/>economic outcomes, and which measures to promote for a reliable investigation of future dynamics? <lb/>208. <lb/>Answers to the first question address directly the goal of turning international students&apos; <lb/>potential and skills into real gains for the EU in the medium and long-run and these answers might have <lb/>immediate practical implications. Here, the ever present underlying assumption is that higher stay rates <lb/>translate into real socio-economic net gains. The second question is more a technical one, but nevertheless <lb/>an important aspect if internationally mobile students&apos; staying behaviour or the effectiveness of intertwined <lb/>policies shall be evaluated more precisely. <lb/>6.1 Measures to foster international students&apos; attachment to the European host country <lb/>209. <lb/>Although some plausible determinants of stay rates have been identified, not all empirical <lb/>findings may be translated into tangible policy measures: for instance, it is just not possible to reduce <lb/>geographical distance between a country of origin and a destination country. Nevertheless, there might be <lb/>some policies which have the potential to strengthen the EU&apos;s retention capabilities by increasing <lb/>countries&apos; or individuals&apos; &apos;proximity&apos; in other domains, e.g. in the sense of reducing barriers to integration <lb/>and by lowering associated costs. <lb/>210. <lb/>The overarching goal has to be to foster international students&apos; attachment to EU host countries <lb/>and to facilitate integration in general as well as into the labour market in particular. As the main leverage <lb/>points for retaining talents in the EU have been identified the following aspects: <lb/>1. Group specific recruitment <lb/>International students from some countries of origin display a higher inclination towards staying in the <lb/>EU than others. Furthermore, focusing on undergraduate international students implies that these <lb/>students have more time to get familiar with a host country&apos;s culture, language and administrative <lb/>procedures. This in turn reduces the effective (and perceived) obstacles for staying after graduation. <lb/>Recruiting and educating more of these likely stayers would then subsequently translate into higher <lb/>numbers of stayers. <lb/>2. Granting funding for advanced studies <lb/>Scholarship programmes&apos; negative monetary incentives, i.e. to induce return after graduation, appear <lb/>to be ineffective. The other way round, providing funding to doctoral students and offering them the <lb/>opportunity to become more familiar with host country specific research fields strengthens their <lb/>attachment to the host country and reduces financial insecurity. Funding schemes could be <lb/>concentrated in those areas which are perceived to suffer from a certain &apos;brain&apos; shortage. This might <lb/>be achievable within the framework of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions and explicitly address <lb/>international students at the end of their masters&apos; programme, just when they decide whether to stay or <lb/>to return. Most importantly, funding opportunities have to be made publicly known in the designated <lb/>target group. <lb/>3. Language courses <lb/>Even if more and more study programmes are taught in English, most EU countries&apos; business and <lb/>daily life language is not English. Offering more intensive high-quality language courses and setting <lb/>incentives for participation during studies will reduce actual or perceived comparative disadvantages <lb/>regarding employment. As taking additional courses implies higher workload, an integration of these <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 <lb/></note>

			<page>58 <lb/></page>

			<body>courses into the ECTS system deems advisable. As such courses foster social inclusion, tapping the <lb/>European Social Fund to support high-quality language courses at universities or for university <lb/>students could be a feasible solution. <lb/>4. Labour market policies <lb/>As the analysis of labour market outcomes has shown, there are some dimensions where international <lb/>graduate stayers find themselves in a less favourable situation: they tend to be more often in part-time <lb/>and less adequate employment, considering their educational attainment. Here, providing additional <lb/>support, e.g. by financing seminars specifically designed for introducing international students to <lb/>national peculiarities of an application process, might improve their integration into the labour market. <lb/>Moreover, all essential information from employment agencies should be available not solely in the <lb/>national language, but at least in English or other major languages. This would facilitate the <lb/>understanding of administrative procedures and job search itself. <lb/>From a general point of view, there remain also some policy issues on the macro level: although <lb/>international graduate stayers are willing and able to integrate themselves into a host country&apos;s labour <lb/>market, their willingness to stay is certainly depending on the specific labour market situation. Current <lb/>labour market conditions in some larger EU countries signal however a certain degree of saturation <lb/>regarding tertiary educated labour. If more international graduates are to be kept in order to cope with <lb/>future demographic trends, these underlying adverse labour market conditions for young professionals <lb/>should be addressed first. <lb/>5. Political stability and participation <lb/>Empirical findings indicate that stay rates are higher in politically stable countries and those where the <lb/>possibility for political participation is more pronounced. Whilst the first aspect can be seen as <lb/>guaranteed in any EU member state, more participation opportunities for third country nationals might <lb/>improve their inclination towards staying: if a foreign national contributes to a country&apos;s economic <lb/>and social success he or she should also be given a voice. In this regard, a harmonization of EU <lb/>nationals&apos; and third country nationals&apos; rights would represent a credible commitment. <lb/>6. Institutional design and governance <lb/>Properly working institutions, which handle administrative procedures not only transparently but also <lb/>promptly, are important. For instance, if the processing of visa takes too long, an international <lb/>graduate who would have otherwise found skill-adequate employment in the host country might take <lb/>up a job offer in the country of origin. Furthermore, administrative processes should be designed in <lb/>such a way that they can be understood and appropriately prepared by someone who is not familiar <lb/>with country-specific administrative hurdles. <lb/>7. Innovative and competitive environment <lb/>Keeping the brightest requires being able to offer them an interesting and challenging working or <lb/>living environment. This holds especially true when it comes to graduates in the technical or <lb/>engineering field, and especially for researchers -keeping their ideas means providing them with an <lb/>opportunity to realise these ideas. This in turn strengthens the importance of preserving or even <lb/>increasing technological competitiveness: private and public R&amp;D expenditures have to mirror such <lb/>an aspiration. Furthermore, a research and innovation friendly environment – in a political and social <lb/>dimension alike – is important as well. <lb/>211. <lb/>Potential graduate stayers have probably gained some experience with respect to the <lb/>performance of a host country in some of the above mentioned domains. Being well educated, highly <lb/>mobile and possibly also being a sought employee abroad, they will base their decision to stay to a large <lb/>extent on whether a respective EU member state meets their expectations or not. In the end it is not about <lb/></body>

			<body>announcing a welcoming culture but about adopting concrete measures which actually translate into a <lb/>working and living environment offering real opportunities for those we want to stay. <lb/>6.2 Monitoring international graduates&apos; residential choices <lb/>212. <lb/>Previous chapters&apos; elaborations adverted briefly to some drawbacks regarding the various <lb/>methods to assess international graduates&apos; staying behaviour. Aside from general reliability issues, <lb/>insufficient data coverage and harmonization have been identified as additional limitations in the extended <lb/>version of this paper. Furthermore, all investigated calculation methods can only provide information with <lb/>respect to short-term staying behaviour. <lb/>213. <lb/>Especially the latter deserves some additional considerations as such short-term outcomes might <lb/>be poor predictors for medium-or long-term staying behaviour: if studying abroad and starting the career <lb/>abroad is only seen as one way to increase human capital, e.g. by acquiring international experience, the <lb/>return to a country of origin might have been always part of an individual career plan (Perkins and <lb/>Neumayer, 2013; Findlay et al., 2012). Consequently, short-term stay rates in EU countries might be high <lb/>whilst long-term rates could be very low. This implies that those who have been educated in an EU <lb/>country, gathered country-specific human capital and first practical working experience were afterwards <lb/>likely to leave – probably exactly at a point where they reached a high productivity level. <lb/>214. <lb/>Hence, for the EU to benefit from international graduates&apos; in an extensive way, the goal should <lb/>not be to concentrate exclusively on short-term staying behaviour, but to ensure that the EU remains <lb/>attractive for these individuals for a longer period. Yet, to evaluate whether the EU achieves this objective, <lb/>reliable medium-and long-term stay rates have to be derived. At the present state it is infeasible to obtain <lb/>such measures on the scale of the EU due to a lack of adequate data. In the following, two possible <lb/>approaches to resolve this issue are briefly sketched. <lb/>1. Augmenting EU-LFS <lb/>The basic issue regarding the identification of stayers in the LFS is related to the country of university <lb/>graduation. Currently, it can only be inferred one year after graduation via country of residence at the <lb/>graduation year – this implies directly its short-term nature. If the basic set of items regarding highest <lb/>education attained (level, field and year) was supplemented by &apos;region of graduation&apos;, international <lb/>graduates would be easier to identify and trace over time. This basic adjustment would remove all <lb/>doubts regarding the identification of stayers amongst the set of internationally mobile students. <lb/>Although such a modification would constitute a significant improvement, only a partial picture of <lb/>international graduates&apos; mobility could be derived, namely cohort-specific stay rates for í µí± and í µí± − 1 <lb/>years after graduation. Additional elicitation of the region of work or residence in the year after <lb/>graduation would further allow determining a cohorts&apos; short-run stay rate, even if some time has <lb/>elapsed between graduation and respective survey year. <lb/>Two remarks remain: First, the larger í µí± the fewer stayers can be expected. This might conflict with <lb/>reliability thresholds once again. Second, this simple modification would not enable any inference <lb/>regarding mobility or migratory events after the first year after graduation and before year í µí± − 1. <lb/>Nevertheless it constituted a substantial improvement regarding capturing more facets of dynamic <lb/>staying behaviour in the EU-LFS. <lb/>2. Harmonized graduate survey on the national level <lb/>To avoid the underlying pitfalls related to usage of EU-LFS data, a graduate survey could be suitable <lb/>to derive short-and medium-run stay rates. Since a survey targeting potentially highly mobile <lb/>individuals suffers probably from high non-response, likely to increase over time, and small sample <lb/>size, a special procedure is proposed: implementation as an event history calendar for international <lb/></body>

			<page>60 <lb/></page>

			<body>graduates from nationally representative universities. The so-called event history calendar (Sage et al., <lb/>2013) can be set up as an online-based tool which asks participants to report status changes. These <lb/>changes may cover changes of employment status, residence change but also cover other topics of <lb/>interest, which allows then an analysis with respect to determinants of staying (or returning) behaviour <lb/>on the subject level. Such an approach would in fact account for detailed mobility-related experiences <lb/>in a medium-term time horizon, for example three to five years. <lb/>Participants, however, should be offered some incentive to report changes constantly and to avoid <lb/>increasing non-response levels. This necessity implies that a restriction to a subset of universities was <lb/>unavoidable. These participating universities should host an international student body of substantial <lb/>size whilst offering a wide range of programmes and fields of study. A positive and required by-<lb/>product of involving specific universities is that university-specific numbers of international <lb/>graduates, possibly even by field and sex, could be obtained concurrently. <lb/>Whilst the first approach would be easier to implement, as it does not involve the development of a specific <lb/>tool on the European level, the second was suitable to deliver more detailed insights into sub-groups&apos; <lb/>staying behaviour. Furthermore, detailed determinants of international graduates&apos; mobility could be <lb/>investigated as well. <lb/>Both approaches would constitute a significant improvement to the current state regarding the examination <lb/>of dynamic staying behaviour of international students and graduates. If we want to understand what <lb/>makes them stay in a longer perspective, we need a reliable and transnationally comparable data source. <lb/>7 SUMMARY <lb/>215. <lb/>This report investigated the preferences of internationally mobile students with a special focus <lb/>on post-graduation mobility. The key findings emerging during this research project, as well as the main <lb/>implications will be briefly summarised below. <lb/>216. <lb/>Some stylised facts on the distribution of internationally mobile students in the EU: <lb/> With almost 1.5 million international students enrolled in 2012, the 28 EU countries constitute still the <lb/>most attractive destination area for studying abroad -38 percent of all internationally mobile students <lb/>chose the EU in 2012. However, Asian destination countries are becoming increasingly more popular. <lb/> Approximately two thirds of internationally mobile students in the EU come from outside the EU. <lb/> Students from Asia and Latin America choose the EU as a destination much more frequently than 10 <lb/>years ago. This mirrors the growing importance of these countries in the global context. <lb/> Some EU countries are primarily destinations in the context of intra-EU mobility (Austria, Belgium, <lb/>Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovakia). Others are especially attractive <lb/>for students from non-EU and non-OECD countries, as the composition of their international student <lb/>body displays (Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania and Sweden). <lb/> Geographical proximity, historical ties and language similarities seem to contribute in a substantial way <lb/>to students&apos; country preferences. <lb/> Some countries, in particular (?)their higher education institutions, attract male and female students in <lb/>different ways, which is likely associated with the curriculum offered by study programmes. <lb/> Aside from some Eastern European countries, the preferred field of study is social sciences, business <lb/>and law. Most frequently chosen studies in these Eastern EU members belong to the field of health <lb/>and welfare. <lb/></body>

			<body>217. <lb/>The main insights from the exploratory study part 45 concern the identification and discussion of <lb/>internationally mobile students&apos; staying behaviour: <lb/> Typically, measures of staying or returning behaviour of internationally mobile students in the <lb/>literature vary drastically for destination countries. This variation originates from a multitude of <lb/>sources, such as countries of origin, reference year, time horizon, calculation procedure, underlying <lb/>data source and type of student (e.g. Germany: 9 – 77.5%, the Netherlands: 29 – 94%, United <lb/>Kingdom: 3 – 64%). <lb/> More than a dozen alternative calculation methods were evaluated in the context of EU destination <lb/>countries. Some of these examined methods generated for over 170 countries of origin specific stay <lb/>rates. <lb/> Within the exploratory study, a substantial degree of between-method variation could be observed on <lb/>the EU member state level. This phenomenon is mainly driven by small sample sizes, data quality and <lb/>partial violation of required assumptions. To mitigate stay rates&apos; sensitivity to those issues, stay rates <lb/>have been constructed in most cases as three year average over the years 2010 to 2012. <lb/> For the EU as a whole, aggregate stay rates from stayers from all non-EU source countries lie within a <lb/>range of 16.4 to 29.1%. <lb/> Derived stay rates on the EU level are especially high for students from North-Western Africa and the <lb/>Commonwealth of Independent States. Large enrolment numbers do not automatically imply high stay <lb/>rates; for instance Chinese students, being by far the largest group, display only a stay rate between <lb/>13.7 and 15.5%. <lb/> Current data sources only allow assessing short-term stay rates (6-12 months after the end of studies), <lb/>this implies that the dynamic nature of subsequent staying decisions at a later career stage cannot be <lb/>analysed. <lb/>218. <lb/>Taking into account potential shortcomings of permit based stay rates these bilateral measures <lb/>nevertheless offer the opportunity to investigate potential determinants of staying behaviour. The most <lb/>essential results are the following ones: <lb/> Internationally mobile students see their studies abroad as an integral part of their career path. <lb/>Subsequent staying decisions are not taken lightly but made in light of perceived opportunities. <lb/> Addressing the impact of perceived opportunities by observable differences between destination and <lb/>source countries in socio-economic or socio-political dimensions provides valuable insights on an <lb/>aggregate level. <lb/> Similarity between host and source countries&apos; language are associated with higher stay rates. A larger <lb/>distance between these countries, reflecting higher monetary costs of migration and lower degrees of <lb/>cultural proximity, is indicative of lower stay rates. <lb/> Assuming that internationally mobile students base their staying or returning decision purely on <lb/>economic differentials around their graduation might be too short-sighted. <lb/> Higher general unemployment has not necessarily a deterring effect. Tertiary educated workers might <lb/>still be able to find employment in a niche, according to their qualification. <lb/> If an EU host country scores better regarding institutional quality and governance effectiveness, higher <lb/>stay rates can be observed. This gives rise to the claim that stayers prefer a &apos;reliable&apos; business or daily <lb/>life environment. <lb/> In a similar manner, higher scores regarding technological readiness and innovation serve as predictors <lb/>for higher stay rates. <lb/> Living circumstances in general have to be considered as relevant factors as well – more pronounced <lb/>levels of political stability and absence of violence are associated with more likely staying decisions. <lb/></body>

			<body>But if (political) participation opportunities are more developed in the home country, return becomes <lb/>more likely. <lb/> These possible determinants deliver a plausible explanation why stay rates amongst students from other <lb/>OECD countries are typically very low and stay rates from students from less developed or politically <lb/>less stable countries are much higher. <lb/>219. <lb/>Examining the impact of post-graduation staying decision on European economies allowed <lb/>drawing the following conclusions: <lb/> Regarding labour market outcomes, those internationally mobile students who decide to stay are likely <lb/>to be positively selected, especially if permission to stay is only granted in case of employment. <lb/> International stayers have an employment rate which is at least as high as for their domestic peers. <lb/>Unemployment is also not more frequent amongst stayers. The subsample of stayers from other EU <lb/>countries is more often self-employed. <lb/> Part-time employment is more widespread amongst international stayers, partially due to the fact that <lb/>this group consists to a larger extent of married women. A positive selection of stayers explains also <lb/>why they have a higher likelihood of having found permanent employment. <lb/> Whilst there are no significant differences regarding income, international stayers face a much higher <lb/>probability of working in a job requiring only medium or low skills. This is mainly driven by stayers <lb/>from non-EU countries and points to problematic skill mismatches. <lb/> Fields of study and preferred residential locations of international stayers lead to the conclusion that <lb/>they have a low inclination towards selecting themselves into labour market segments with alleged <lb/>shortages – they strictly prefer metropolitan areas and are not more likely to have graduated in the <lb/>fields of &quot; science, mathematics and computing &quot; , &quot; engineering, manufacturing and construction &quot; or <lb/> &quot; health and welfare &quot; . <lb/> Current labour market conditions, i.e. increasing unemployment rates for tertiary educated labour <lb/>below 30 years of age and declining real wages for young professionals in some larger EU economies, <lb/>are neither favourable nor fostering the attractiveness of the EU labour market(s). <lb/> International stayers can be expected to become net contributors to EU economies by no later than <lb/>graduation. But already during their studies, their consumption of commodity and services adds to the <lb/>host country&apos;s demand. <lb/> Fiscal implications of providing funding for the education of internationally mobile students and <lb/>related inefficiencies due to externalities could be taken into account, for instance by conditioning <lb/>subsidies on subsequent staying behaviour. <lb/>220. <lb/>Considering all above mentioned findings, two main policy recommendations can be distilled. <lb/>The first one refers to structural data deficiencies which prevent a more in-depth analysis: to broaden <lb/>analytical possibilities in this line of research, the harmonisation of existing data series should be <lb/>promoted. Relevant dynamic aspects, regarding the retention of internationally mobile students after <lb/>graduation in a medium-or long-run, can only be addressed if either the EU-LFS is slightly extended or a <lb/>representative sample of international graduates participates in an online based survey. But, once again <lb/>referring to the introductory Wilson quote, exactly such a medium-to long-term analysis enables to assess <lb/>for how long the EU can &apos;borrow&apos; the brains of internationally mobile academics. <lb/>221. <lb/>The second recommendation encompasses a catalogue of measures to boost the EU&apos;s <lb/>attractiveness, hence to increase stay rates. Proposed policy measures draw on a smooth labour market <lb/>integration of international graduates by setting further incentives to remove language barriers already <lb/>during studies or providing support regarding country-specific labour market peculiarities. Actively <lb/>supporting post-graduate studies seems to be another promising way to increase retention of international <lb/>talents in a medium-run. At the same time, the EU and all its members are well advised not only to <lb/>maintain, but to cultivate their strong points: political stability and participation possibilities, reliable <lb/>institutions and governance structure, as well as an innovative and competitive environment – all these <lb/></body>

			<body>aspects exert a non-negligible influence on the decision to stay of highly-skilled, but also highly-mobile, <lb/>individuals. <lb/>222. <lb/>If we want to turn the potential, ensuing from a huge pool of internationally mobile students, <lb/>into real and lasting gains for the EU, we should provide these individuals with long-term perspectives, not <lb/>only long-term permits. <lb/></body>
