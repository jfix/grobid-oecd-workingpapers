	<p type="introduction">The OECD Green Growth Strategy, launched in May 2011, provides concrete recommendations and<lb/> measurement tools to support countries&apos; efforts to achieve economic growth and development, while at the<lb/> same time ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the ecosystem services on which our well-being<lb/> relies. The strategy proposes a flexible policy framework that can be tailored to different country<lb/> circumstances and stages of development.<lb/> OECD Green Growth Papers should not be reported as representing the official views of the OECD or<lb/> of its member countries. The opinions expressed and arguments employed are those of the author(s).<lb/> OECD Green Growth Papers aim to describe preliminary results or research in progress by the<lb/> author(s) and are published to stimulate discussion on specific topics and obtain feedback from interested<lb/> audiences.<lb/> They complement the OECD Green Growth Studies series, which aims to provide in-depth reviews of<lb/> the green growth issues faced by different sectors.<lb/> This paper has been authorised for publication by Jon Lomøy, Director, Development Co-operation<lb/> Directorate.
