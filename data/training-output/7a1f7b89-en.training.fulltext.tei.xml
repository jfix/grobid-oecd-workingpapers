			<head>What we did<lb/></head>

			<p>This report investigates the convergence of public transport and innovative mobility solutions, such as ride<lb/> services, car-and bicycle-sharing, app-enabled on-demand micro-bus services, and platforms that connect<lb/> app-using travellers and drivers. It examines the role of public authorities in ensuring this convergence<lb/> supports commercial innovation as well as public policy objectives and identifies principles to guide<lb/> partnerships between innovative mobility services and public transport operators. The report also explores<lb/> where action may be needed to ensure that this convergence does not lead to reduced mobility options for<lb/> those that have difficulty using existing transport modes, and in particular, how the needs of an ageing<lb/> population may be met in an evolving mobility service landscape.<lb/> This study was organised under the auspices of the International Transport Forum&apos;s Corporate Partnership<lb/> Board (CPB). It is based on a workshop with commercial actors, public authorities and other experts that<lb/> took place in November 2016, and interviews with various officials and experts as well as input from CPB<lb/> member companies. Additionally, extensive desk research for this study was carried out by the<lb/> International Transport Forum.<lb/></p>

			<head>What we found<lb/></head>

			<p>The rapid deployment of new types of mobility services has the potential to change the way in which urban<lb/> mobility and access are delivered. This will have an impact on the nature of public transport. The<lb/> convergence of public transport and ride services in particular provides an opportunity to deliver better<lb/> mobility outcomes for a broader share of the population. At the same time it poses clear risks to the<lb/> provision of equitable and sustainable mobility for all.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ride services like those offered by Didi Chuxing, Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber and other innovative mobility options<lb/> -including app-based microtransit platforms like Chariot and car-and bicycle-sharing -account for a small<lb/> share of trips in most urban areas. Nonetheless, they are starting to have an impact of trip-making<lb/> behaviour where they are present and are starting to be seen as a potential complement for first and last<lb/> mile connections. In low density regions difficult to service with public transport and areas where public<lb/> transport is available but quality is perceived to be lacking, ride services may also come to be seen as an<lb/> alternative.<lb/> Some public transport operators and authorities are already exploring partnerships with app-enabled<lb/> mobility services. Most of these initiatives are taking place in the United States – partly because of the<lb/> popularity of ride services there, partly because many urban areas there have difficulty providing attractive<lb/> public transport. Many of the partnerships described in this report are pilot projects or promotional<lb/> campaigns and at present there is no evidence for a permanent shift in public transport service delivery<lb/> towards structural partnerships with ride services. Nonetheless, authorities and ride-service operators are<lb/> using these pilots to test new ways of improving mobility outcomes where it is difficult to provide quality<lb/> public transport.<lb/> Co-operation with ride services is unlikely to save poor-quality public transport, however. Providing first and<lb/> last mile connections via ride services to poor quality (i.e. unreliable, crowded, slow, infrequent) public<lb/> transport will not suffice to attract users to public transport; it certainly seems unlikely to entice car users<lb/> to switch. Such co-operations may result in cost savings for public transport operators in certain contexts.<lb/></p>

			<p>But introducing ride services alone will not reverse a decline in ridership if the overall service offer does not<lb/> result in improved outcomes for travellers.<lb/></p>

			<head>What we recommend<lb/></head>

			<p>Focus on improving overall mobility outcomes, not just on lowering public transport costs<lb/> Replacing more expensive, less demand-responsive and less flexible public transport with less expensive,<lb/> more demand-responsive and more flexible ride services (or other combinations of innovative mobility<lb/> services) can free funds that public transport operators could allocate to improving service quality. Cost<lb/> savings should not be the only motivation for seeking synergies between ride services and public transport.<lb/></p>

			<p>These synergies can be leveraged to provide improved outcomes for travellers while at the same time<lb/> allowing public authorities to deliver on important public policy objectives such as improved equity, reduced<lb/> congestion and improved environmental outcomes.<lb/> Set a vision for urban transport that includes full integration of innovative mobility options<lb/> Public policy is best served when it is framed within a coherent set of visions and goals. These should be<lb/> incorporated into a publicly vetted plan that sets out how authorities intend to deliver on these goals<lb/> despite fast-changing circumstances. This is the case with the public policy approach to innovative mobility<lb/> services, automated driving and generally how digitally-driven changes may fundamentally challenge the<lb/> concept of public transport. One good example of this type of plan is the city of Los Angeles&apos; &quot; Urban Mobility<lb/> Plan in a Digital Age &quot; that re-orients the focus to Mobility as a Service.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ensure partnerships between public transport and innovative mobility operators to improve mobility for all<lb/> people, including those with disabilities<lb/> If innovative mobility services complement or replace accessible mainstream public transport, they will<lb/> need to provide at least the same degree of spontaneity and flexibility to travel when the individual wants<lb/> or needs. Where frequent accessible buses and on-street hail taxis are available, licensed ride services must<lb/> not erode overall levels of accessible transport. App-based ride services can improve overall accessibility by<lb/> better matching supply of accessible vehicles and demand -but only if the design of the service and of the<lb/> partnership takes into account the specific needs of travellers with impairments.<lb/> Target low-performing or costly routes, and leverage government assets to guide convergence<lb/></p>

			<p>Where public transport is expensive and service quality is low, replacing certain poorly-performing,<lb/> expensive bus services may increase the overall attractiveness of public transport. By undertaking<lb/> inventories of existing public transport routes to examine the potential for alternative service delivery<lb/> models, public authorities and public transport operators can evaluate where synergies with innovative<lb/> mobility services are strongest. Governments can also leverage assets they control to guide this<lb/> convergence: Re-allocating parking space at public transport hubs, for instance, can improve the<lb/> convenience of trips by public transport combined with rides-services; as can the creation of curb-side<lb/> pick-up and drop-off zones.<lb/> Split regulatory oversight from operation of urban transport and adapt procurement practices<lb/></p>

			<p>The governance of public transport will play an essential role in either facilitating or impeding the<lb/> convergence of traditional and innovative mobility services, and of ride services in particular. Split<lb/> responsibilities complicate the task of aligning outcomes. For instance the regulation of ride services may<lb/> be in the hands of an authority in charge of taxi or for-hire services, while public transport regulation may<lb/> fall under a completely different authority. Governance models that unify regulatory oversight and planning<lb/> functions, define quality outcomes and performance objectives, and set contractual relationships to deliver<lb/> these across a wide range of mobility operators may accelerate the integration of these into a co-ordinated<lb/> ecosystem. Procurement rules for ride services and platform-based micro-transit services, however, will<lb/> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – 9<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> have to adapt to the specificities of these services. In particular, this will require a focus on outcomes (e.g.<lb/> average wait times) versus strict service delivery (e.g. on-time performance).<lb/> Mitigate innovation risk for new services through pilots and portfolio management<lb/> Public authorities must ensure that public expenditure delivers value to citizens. This is understandable, but<lb/> can also hamper their ability to engage in innovative arrangements where the value for the public is initially<lb/> uncertain. Time-bound pilot projects contain this risk, and many jurisdictions in the United States have<lb/> used these. Public agencies might also create public-private &quot; innovation laboratories &quot; that manage a<lb/> portfolio of new projects to help identify interesting initiatives. National authorities can help as well, by<lb/> creating dedicated programmes to help fund trials that have the potential for widespread replication. A good<lb/> example is the US Federal Transit Agency&apos;s &quot; Mobility on Demand Sandbox &quot; programme. Another option to<lb/> avoid the risk of lock-in with single service providers is for public authorities to implement user-side<lb/> subsidies rather than supplier-side subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Incentivise age-and disability-friendly interactions in partnerships between public transport and<lb/> ride-service operators<lb/> Ageing has a major influence on disability trends. These, in turn, will have an impact on the ability of an<lb/> ageing population to remain mobile and enjoy good access to services, opportunities and other people.<lb/></p>

			<p>Many older people are affected by impairments including loss of visual acuity, loss of hearing, short-term<lb/> memory loss or difficulties in balancing. The design and delivery of partnerships between public transport<lb/> and ride services must take this development into account so as not to exclude older people and those with<lb/> disabilities. Public authorities should generally ensure that innovative services meet the needs of the<lb/> population as a whole on an inclusive basis. Incentives for ride-services to deploy wheelchair-accessible<lb/> vehicles, appropriate levels of training for drivers, call centres for bookings and questions for users with<lb/> special needs and innovative contracts between operators and public authorities to improve para-transit<lb/> services (like in Boston) are examples for how this can be achieved.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The past few years have seen the rapid global deployment of new types of mobility services that leverage<lb/> advances in ubiquitous computing, geo-location, cashless payment. These services, ranging from car-and<lb/> bicycle-sharing, app-enabled on-demand micro-bus services, and platforms that connect travellers and<lb/> drivers, are starting to significantly disrupt the mobility landscape of cities around the world. Even though<lb/> the most visible of these – ride services like those offered by Didi Chuxing, Grab, Lyft, Ola and Uber -have<lb/> had an important impact on global taxi markets, they still only account for a relatively small share of trips<lb/> in most urban areas, especially compared to trips taken by car, walking and cycling, and public transport.<lb/> In San Francisco, one of the cities where uptake of app-based ride services like those offered by<lb/> Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) Lyft and Uber has been strongest in North America, these<lb/> services account for 2% of all trips though about a quarter of all residents use these services at least once a<lb/> month (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Recent analysis from New York City indicate that additional travel generated by TNCs<lb/> account for 3.5% of overall distances travelled by all vehicles in 2016 (<ref type="biblio">Schaller, 2017</ref>) (see also Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. San Francisco Bay Area mode share (2015)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Source: San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Travel Decisions Survey (2015).<lb/> Despite accounting for a small share of urban trips, the popularity of app-based ride services is evident in<lb/> the rapid growth of trips in metropolitan areas where they are present, the growing volume of application<lb/> downloads, the increase of new cities serviced and in the number of competing services offered around the<lb/> world. Behind the popularity of ride services is the convenience and flexibility they afford both their users<lb/> and their drivers. This popularity suggests that these services may not only continue to have an impact on<lb/> for-hire markets, but that they may also likely disrupt public transport markets in significant ways. Their<lb/> ultimate impact on urban transport, especially when combined with advances in automated driving, may be<lb/> game-changing since some of the major players in this emerging field have indicated that their goal is to<lb/> deliver most urban trips in the future.<lb/> Public transport operators have typically not dealt in the kind of diffuse and fractional capacity supply<lb/> provided by many new ride services and, with some rare exceptions, have not typically seen developing<lb/> these markets as part of their core mission. The convergence between traditional public transport operators<lb/> and many ride-sourcing and ride-sharing services, however, is no longer just a theoretical possibility. Some<lb/></p>

			<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

			<table>– 11<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> public transport operators and authorities have already, or are currently in the process of exploring<lb/> partnerships with new, app-enabled mobility services.<lb/></table>

			<p>There are important lessons to be learned for the governance of public transport from the on-going<lb/> confrontation of ride services with, and adaptation of, rules regarding for-hire transport. The report<lb/> &quot; Unfinished Business: A Blueprint for Uber, Lyft and Taxi Regulation &quot; notes:<lb/></p>

			<p>The history of taxi regulation shows the potential peril from poorly constructed<lb/> regulatory frameworks. The product of decisions made over several decades, taxi<lb/> regulations served to limit competition and innovation, compromise the quality and<lb/> reliability of cab services and as a result, limited the taxi industry to niche markets<lb/> centered on business travellers and non-car owning households. (<ref type="biblio">Schaller,2016)<lb/></ref> Similarly, certain types of public transport may become marginalised in the face of new forms of mobility<lb/> services that public transport operators may fail to understand and account for. This is unfortunate since<lb/> there are many areas where traditional public transport operators can seek synergies with emerging ride<lb/> services.<lb/></p>

			<p>The convergence of public transport and ride services in particular could potentially deliver better mobility<lb/> outcomes for a broader share of the population than currently feasible. Yet at the same time it poses clear<lb/> risks to the provision of equitable and sustainable mobility for all. These risks include replacing<lb/> well-understood business models and the regulatory framework governing them with a greater reliance on<lb/> services whose business models are in flux and whose long-term financial robustness is not yet proven.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also a risk that a shift in service from traditional public transport to ride services could lead to a<lb/> loss of travel options for those with mobility impediments since ride services currently do not face the same<lb/> accessibility requirements as public transport. Other risks could include increased congestion and<lb/> environmental degradation and an erosion of equitable access opportunities. These and other risks are only<lb/> potential; and in some cases, they may be overstated since the case can be made that mobility outcomes<lb/> may greatly improve through this convergence. Nonetheless, they highlight the need for properly framing<lb/> the policy principles that should guide action in this area.<lb/></p>

			<p>This report investigates motivations guiding the convergence of ride services and public transport, the role<lb/> public authorities can play to ensure that this convergence supports both commercial innovation and public<lb/> policy objectives and what set of principles can usefully guide partnerships between innovative mobility<lb/> services and public transport operators. In addition, this report explores where action may be needed to<lb/> ensure that this convergence does not lead to reduced mobility options for those that have difficulty using<lb/> existing transport modes, and in particular, how the needs of an ageing population may be met in</p>

			<table>an<lb/> evolving mobility service landscape. It builds on similar work published in 2016 in the International<lb/> Transport Forum&apos;s Corporate Partnership Board report &quot; App-Based Ride and Taxi Services: Principles for<lb/> Regulation &quot; (ITF, 2016a).<lb/> 12 – GETTING AROUND CITIES:THEN, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE…<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> 2. Getting around cities: Then, now and in the future…<lb/></table>

			<p>Urban travel patterns differ around the world, between different cities and amongst different demographic<lb/> and income groups. People travel for different reasons, at different times and with more or less flexibility in<lb/> their trip-making choices. They also value trips differently according to convenience, speed and willingness<lb/> to pay for these and other features. And yet, despite these differences in individual trip-making patterns,<lb/> there are global similarities that broadly characterise urban transport. These include a choice-set that has<lb/> traditionally included walking and cycling, various forms of formal or informal public transportation and<lb/> individual motorcycle or car use. Historically, and in many developing countries today, as incomes rise there<lb/> is a general trend away from the former modes to the latter.<lb/> Urban mobility is the sum total of people moving in and around urban areas to access opportunities, to gain<lb/> access to each other and to gain access to the goods they wish to consume or the movement of goods to<lb/> their final point of consumption. The movement of people and vehicles through cities is perhaps one of the<lb/> most dynamic and noticeable features of urbanisation. Mobility, and the access it confers, is essential in<lb/> delivering agglomeration benefits that result from people crowding together in urban regions. It is also an<lb/> enduring and significant source of frustration and dis-benefits linked to the erosion of the very benefits it<lb/> helps support. Managing congestion, eliminating traffic injuries, reducing noise and environmental impacts<lb/> and improving equity outcomes all are integral public objectives that guide policy in this field.<lb/></p>

			<head>Traditional urban transport modes: Limited choices, broad uptake<lb/></head>

			<p>Mobility has historically been delivered by a relatively limited set of travel modes and options: active modes<lb/> (walking and cycling), formal and informal public transport and individualised motorised modes covering<lb/> two-and three-wheelers and cars. For the better part of the last half-century, this choice set has been<lb/> constant across the world albeit with each mode accounting for a different share across regions, in time and<lb/> for various trip purposes.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are a number of reasons that people choose one mode over another but at the heart of these choices<lb/> is the expected and achieved outcome and user experience. These aspects, in terms of speed, comfort,<lb/> safety, cost, accessibility, reliability and convenience, are critical in determining demand for transport<lb/> services, at least when there is a choice of alternative ways to travel (ITF, 2014). The relevant measure of<lb/> user experience extends beyond each individual trip to the entirety of the oftentimes complex trip chains<lb/> that characterise everyday travel. In the end, people generally choose the mode that best fits the a small<lb/> subset of their overall daily trips, either because those trips are the most important or are those for which<lb/> the fewest acceptable alternative modes exist, and then use that mode for all trips out of both convenience<lb/> and habit.<lb/></p>

			<p>The relative simplicity and flexibility of individual motorised travel helps explain why cars dominate travel<lb/> within many urban regions (especially outside the core) across the OECD member countries and are making<lb/> rapid inroads in rapidly-developing economies around the world. While car travel in certain high-income<lb/> countries has stagnated or has even decreased recently, many people have grown accustomed to the<lb/> convenience that at least occasional car travel confers.<lb/> Convenience (e.g. faster, on-demand, perception of low cost) is one of the strongest attractions of private<lb/> cars and motorised two-wheelers in cities. Because they offer flexible and on-demand door-to-door travel<lb/> opportunities, people generally value car-based mobility highly; they are willing to put up with its cost<lb/> which is higher than walking and cycling, and often higher than the consumer-facing price of many public<lb/> transport services. They are also willing to overlook inherent inefficiencies (in terms of poor capital use<lb/> given the amount of time cars remain idle, energy efficiency and time losses due to traffic congestion at<lb/> peak use periods) because of the utility they derive from travelling with these modes. This helps to explain<lb/> the persistent attraction that people have for acquiring and using cars. Associated with this preference,<lb/> many people in mid-to highly-motorised regions have made housing, employment and lifestyle choices that<lb/> require some level of access to cars.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all of these contexts, e.g. where car use remains elevated or is becoming more popular, there will be<lb/> pressure to prolong driving as long as possible in life. At the same time, those who lose the ability to safely<lb/> operate vehicles may see a reduction in their mobility options and access – especially if they live in areas<lb/> that are difficultly served by other modes. This has important policy repercussions when considering how to<lb/> ensure high-quality access and mobility for all, while not eroding overall gains in road safety as a result of<lb/> retaining older drivers who may no longer be able to safely operate cars.<lb/> Some see the eventual arrival of self-driving vehicles – especially those operating as shared mobility fleets<lb/> (see ITF, 2016) as one way around inequitable outcomes that may arise if people are no longer able to<lb/> drive cars and do not have high quality alternative options. Automated vehicle technology can potentially<lb/> prolong car-like mobility for many, but it is not a panacea. It will require careful framing in order to not<lb/> erode commonly shared public policy outcomes (e.g. congestion mitigation, use of public space, energy and<lb/> environmental impacts).<lb/> Taxis provide many of the benefits of individually-owned car mobility albeit at a higher price for consumers<lb/> and oftentimes lower convenience than cars. This lower convenience generally stems from the lower<lb/> flexibility and availability of taxis as compared to cars, although in certain dense urban environments with<lb/> elevated parking costs, taxis – especially street-hailed taxis – have provided an attractive urban mobility<lb/> option. Taxis therefore have historically become a means for those not familiar with a city to get around, for<lb/> wealthier travellers to get around where car use may be inconvenient and as a way of filling the gap in<lb/> public transport provision for those who do not have access to cars – especially in off-peak hours and to<lb/> destinations not well-served by public transport.<lb/></p>

			<p>Public transport – e.g. openly shared passenger services that are available to the general public – offer<lb/> essential mobility services in urban areas. These include the efficient provision of large-scale and mostly<lb/> frequent passenger transport across fixed-route networks that would be difficult and, in many cases,<lb/> impossible to provide otherwise. These services make living in urban areas highly convenient though in<lb/> many cases the fixed nature of both networks and schedules may make public transport itself not<lb/> necessarily convenient. This is especially the case if travel to destinations includes transfers and significant<lb/> waiting times. Public transport also provides basic mobility to those who may not have access to cars and<lb/> whose travel requirements are not suited to walking or cycling.<lb/></p>

			<p>Public transport thus serves different populations and is characterised by different levels of service and<lb/> quality. High-frequency, rapid and good quality public transport supply may compete with cars in terms of<lb/> convenience, cost and overall user experience. It does so while decreasing per-passenger land-take, energy<lb/> use and environmental impacts due to efficiencies derived from scale and electrification in the case of many<lb/> rail, trolley and electric-powered bus systems. As such, these types of public transport networks represent<lb/> an essential component in delivering more sustainable urban transport options.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where investments in public transport have been consistent and accompanied by land-use decisions that<lb/> concentrate populations in easily-serviced areas, core public transport networks are generally well-used and<lb/> account for a significant mode share. These central networks (including both well-used rail and bus lines)<lb/> typically provide good service between large residential areas and employment centres, especially at peak<lb/> hours. As such, they best serve commuting trips. Other travel, especially that occurring off-peak and in<lb/> lower density areas outside of these key corridors, may be more difficult to service cost-effectively. This is<lb/> especially the case for trips connecting the first and last kilometres to core public transport networks.<lb/></p>

			<head>14</head>

			<table>– GETTING AROUND CITIES:THEN, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE…<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/></table>

			<p>Delivering these trips is generally an expensive proposition for public transport operators and often requires<lb/> some form of cross-subsidy from other more profitable services or a direct payment from public authorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are real equity stakes at play since public transport services focusing primarily on peak travel along<lb/> core networks may not adequately respond to the mobility needs of certain demographic and or geographic<lb/> groups. Women generally have complex trip-making patterns that extend beyond the pendular commute<lb/> trip. Public transport, especially in low-density urban and suburban areas, may not provide as convenient a<lb/> service as cars in those instances. Many low-income workers are employed in the service sector,<lb/> manufacturing jobs or in part-time employment. These jobs may be located in areas poorly served by public<lb/> transport or may have schedules that are incompatible with public transport services. For these<lb/> populations, a car, when they can afford it, may be the most convenient option – and a taxi, an expensive<lb/> but sometimes convenient choice.<lb/></p>

			<p>Historically, public transport started as relatively informal systems and this continues to be the case in<lb/> many countries today, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Informal public transport systems (e.g.<lb/> jitneys, collectivos, matutus) have a range of characteristics that may compare favourably or unfavourably<lb/> with formal public transport systems. They generally have unpublished (or inexistent) schedules and routes,<lb/> and may change service frequently. They are largely unregulated and thus may not be safe nor offer<lb/> sufficient consumer protection. On the other hand, these services offer great flexibility at affordable rates<lb/> for many inhabitants. As micro-enterprises, they also offer a non-negligible source of income to their<lb/> drivers. The history of public transport is marked by the gradual formalisation of these types of services to<lb/> improve co-ordination, safety and transparency but this has come at the expense of convenience for many<lb/> users of these systems. Tellingly, many ride services mimic several of the beneficial characteristics of<lb/> informal transport systems while delivering better safety and consumer outcomes, albeit at higher costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>In many OECD member countries, public authorities seek to ensure that as many people as possible are<lb/> afforded meaningful mobility options and are not excluded from participating in essential activities due to<lb/> physical or other impediments. The right for equitable access is codified in law building on the example of<lb/> the</p>

			<table>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (USA) and the U.N. Standard Rules for the Equalization of<lb/> Opportunities of 1993.<lb/></table>

			<p>For public transport, this has led to requirements to provide services for those with a wide range of physical<lb/> or cognitive impairments. Paratransit services ensure a minimum coverage of accessible services for those<lb/> qualifying to use them but this coverage comes at a significant cost to the public authorities that subsidise<lb/> them – often at levels several times that of traditional public transport due to the need for specialised<lb/> equipment, dedicated vehicles and well-trained drivers. In the United States, paratransit services cost on<lb/> average 3.5 times the cost of providing a regular public transport trip (<ref type="biblio">Kaufman et al., 2015</ref>) and these<lb/> costs are increasing as a greater share of the population ages into impairments that require specialised<lb/> services and/or accessible vehicles. Paratransit services are also typically more cumbersome to use than<lb/> traditional public transport (requiring reservations hours and up to a day in advance) and are in some cases<lb/> less dependable.<lb/> Because of the high and growing cost of providing mandated paratransit services and the desire to ensure<lb/> high levels of equitable access, many authorities are seeking to make the general public transport fleet<lb/> accessible to all but the most physically challenged travellers. The same is true for taxis with<lb/> disability-accessible requirements , ranging from a percentage to the whole of the fleet. In many instances,<lb/> those travelling with physical or cognitive impairments do not require the use of an expensive, dedicated,<lb/> wheelchair-accessible vehicle but could benefit from improved accessibility in other transport modes<lb/> combined with better trained operators. Thus in those regions where providing such a broad level of access<lb/> has been a focus, public transport and taxis represent important complements to the dedicated paratransit<lb/> fleet and deliver essential services to mobility-challenged travellers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Innovative mobility options: More choices but an uncertain future<lb/></head>

			<p>The set of mobility options that have characterised most cities in the world has expanded in recent years<lb/> with the appearance of many new public and private sector services. New business models including car-<lb/>and bike-sharing, ride-sourcing and ride-sharing have become possible thanks to advances in technology,<lb/> algorithmic skill, ubiquitous internet access and the broad uptake of mobile computing and smart phones.<lb/></p>

			<p>Not all of these services are new – in some instances, they have given new life to existing services like<lb/> on-demand public transport. As these services become more popular, they both complement existing<lb/> services and provide new alternatives for many travellers. The set of emerging mobility options is<lb/> constantly evolving as are the companies or partnerships providing them.<lb/></p>

			<head>Many evolving and shifting business models<lb/></head>

			<p>The rapid spread of these services and their sometimes unpredictable evolution underscores the limited<lb/> capacity of classic modal-based approaches to address them, especially approaches that focus on a strict<lb/> dichotomy between public and private transport. At least on a strategic level, policy can be better served by<lb/> focusing on outcomes rather than focusing on the delivery of specific services. In so doing, public<lb/> authorities and private operators will need to account for the growing diversity of options that can be<lb/> mobilised to improve mobility and access outcomes. In this context, perhaps a more relevant conceptual<lb/> lens for this century&apos;s urban transport systems is between transport using one&apos;s own vehicle and transport<lb/> provided by personalised or shared services.<lb/></p>

			<p>The innovative mobility ecosystem is complex and combines multiple conceptual models that bring a much<lb/> wider range of actors into play than before. Capturing the diversity of innovative mobility services is not<lb/> straightforward since business models are constantly evolving and new services are continually being<lb/> trialled -even within individual companies. These models may include formal business-to-consumer<lb/> services (commercial car-sharing, micro-transit, bicycle and scooter sharing), peer-to-peer models for<lb/> sharing the use of cars or that enable the sourcing of rides, platform-based business models that connect<lb/> passengers and drivers (or goods and carriers) and hybrid models that combine aspects of some or all of<lb/> those approaches (<ref type="biblio">Shaheen et al., 2016a</ref>).<lb/> From a policy perspective, the diversity of new actors and business models, their rapid flux and evolution<lb/> and the many potential deployment pathways complicate the task for public authorities seeking to create<lb/> new partnerships. This is especially true for transport authorities that are operating or contracting/procuring<lb/> services from relatively stable and established public transport operators.<lb/> At present, the evolving mobility landscape in many cities around the world includes some or all of the<lb/> types of services outlined below and largely drawn from the work of the Transportation Sustainability<lb/> Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley (<ref type="biblio">Shaheen et al., 2016a</ref>; 2016b).<lb/> Bicycle-sharing<lb/> Bicycle-sharing allows members and users to access bicycles that are available in public space. Analogue<lb/> bicycle-sharing systems have been around for decades but the arrival of IT-enabled, automated<lb/> bicycle-sharing systems has led to massive growth. In 2016, approximately 2 million shared bicycles were<lb/> available in second generation or later systems in 63 countries and in over 1 000 cities, municipalities or<lb/> district jurisdictions (Demaio, 2017). In sufficiently dense networks and where provisions have been made<lb/> to increase bicycle safety, bicycle-share systems can improve access and extend the reach of traditional<lb/> public transport networks.<lb/> Shared bicycle systems require registration and payment is ensured via various subscription or time-based<lb/> fees. There are several bike-share models. Currently, bike-share systems are dominated by dock-based<lb/> networks where bicycles are picked up and returned at specific stations. These systems must address some<lb/> inherent challenges that have an impact on their viability, including deploying a sufficiently widespread and<lb/> dense network of stations and cost-effectively handling system-wide rebalancing needs. An alternative,<lb/> emerging model for bike-share is centred on dockless fleets of bicycles that can be picked up and dropped<lb/> off anywhere within a within a geo-fenced zone. In these instances, bicycles come equipped with on-board<lb/> GPS and communications equipment. Some peer-to-peer services also exist. Most IT-enabled systems have<lb/> proprietary apps that enable users to find bicycles and drop-off locations. In some cases, open application<lb/> programming interfaces (APIs) allow third party developers to include bike-share data in their applications.<lb/> A standardised bicycle data model – the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) – has been developed<lb/> in order to facilitate data-sharing and inclusion of bicycle share data in modular APIs. This specification is<lb/> modelled along the lines of the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and may facilitate the integration<lb/> of bicycle-share services and payments with other bundled mobility services.<lb/> Car-sharing (and scooter-sharing)<lb/></table>

			<p>Car-sharing services allow members to access cars for individual trips or short periods of time. They require<lb/> registration and can be paid on a per-use, per-time or on a subscription basis. As with bicycle sharing,<lb/> car-sharing has a relatively long history in its pre-digital form but its success has really taken off with the<lb/> transition to online and digitally-enabled platforms. As with shared bicycles, they can be station-based or<lb/> free-floating. In both instances, data is generated and logged in order to manage payment and system<lb/> operation. Some systems share this data through APIs that offer some level of integration with third-party<lb/> service providers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Car sharing fleets can be commercially owned business-to-consumer ventures though there are many<lb/> services that facilitate peer-to-peer car sharing. In some instances, car-sharing may be bundled with other<lb/> mobility services (e.g. agreements between Mobility Car Sharing and the Swiss Federal Railways). Both the<lb/> range of actors involved in various forms of car-sharing and their business models are in flux with many<lb/> traditional rental car companies and automobile manufacturers creating, purchasing or taking stakes in<lb/> car-sharing companies. Common data standards might facilitate the bundling of car-sharing services with<lb/> other mobility offers (including first-and last-kilometre public transport) but these are currently lacking.<lb/></p>

			<p>Though it is too early to tell, vertically integrated models where some form of car-sharing is embedded in a<lb/> suite of other mobility services offered by a single company seems to be an approach favoured by major<lb/> automotive companies.<lb/> Much along the lines of car-sharing business models, some companies offer scooter-sharing services that<lb/> are typically free-floating rather than station-based.<lb/> On-demand micro-transit<lb/> Many public transport companies, especially in low density areas in Europe, have offered on-demand public<lb/> transport services as a way of reducing the costs of fixed route services in thin markets. One example of a<lb/> comprehensive, national implementation of such a platform-enabled on-demand marketplace is<lb/> FlexDanmark (see Box 1). This system builds on regulatory requirements to ensure health-and<lb/> education-related accessibility across the country to create a nationally co-ordinated and optimised<lb/> on-demand transport facilitated by a common IT platform. By centralising information on demand and<lb/> creating a marketplace to provide flexible supply, it enables specialised trips (medical, school, etc.) to be<lb/> carried out more efficiently and at lower cost than by traditional services and allows other trips to be carried<lb/> out by shared vehicles rather than by single occupancy cars or large poorly-utilised buses.<lb/></p>

			<table>Taking advantage of new technological possibilities and in part inspired by informal public transport systems<lb/> around the world, some companies have developed app-enabled shared micro-bus services that replicate<lb/> the flexibility of car-based travel (or taxi and ride-sourcing) in certain markets (e.g. Chariot, Didi Bus, Grab<lb/> Shuttle, Ola Shuttle, Via or Ford&apos;s Go Ride service). Multiple business models supporting these services<lb/> have been developed and they encompass different approaches to service design. For example, some<lb/> operate fixed routes that are in-part crowd-sourced by users (e.g. Chariot – see Figure 2) and others offer<lb/> services where riders are directed to pop-up stops within defined geographic areas. Some companies, like<lb/> Chariot, offer a mix of crowd-sourced fixed-route services alongside point-to-point travel. For example, the<lb/> Chariot Direct service runs counter to dominant commuting flows in San Francisco as a way to offer more<lb/> flexible options for commuters heading away from downtown and to help rebalance (and monetise)<lb/></table>

			<p>Chariot&apos;s fleet. Market entry and zone coverage is also handled in many ways. Bridj, an app-based<lb/> micro-transit operator no longer in operation, gauged market entry based, in part, on app downloads and<lb/> adjusts its service zones dynamically by analysing service requests from riders. Chariot, on the other hand,<lb/> mixes pre-set routes based on obvious trip-generating and trip-ending destinations with crowd-sourced<lb/> routes requests and new account sign-ins. Cashless payments, reserved seating, transfer-less rides and<lb/> geo-localised customisation are all part of the user experience for services whose public-facing cost is<lb/> somewhere between traditional public transport and ride-sourcing services or taxis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. National platform-enabled demand responsive transport: FlexDanmark<lb/></head>

			<p>In light of regulatory requirements to ensure public service access for people with mobility impairments, and for<lb/> medical and school-related trips throughout the country and in light of the elevated cost of doing so via<lb/> fixed-route bus services – especially in rural and peri-urban areas – a number of Danish transport operators and<lb/> authorities joined forces to put in place a nationwide IT platform and service offer for cost-effective and<lb/> high-quality on-demand transport – Flex Traffic operated by the mixed public-private company FlexDanmark.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Traffic and other impacts of ride services in New York City<lb/></head>

			<p>Independent third-party analysis of ride-service impacts has been limited in cities where these services have been<lb/> deployed. One reason for this is that ride service operators understandably want to preserve commercially<lb/> sensitive and privacy-eroding data – especially in light of the obligations that some public authorities have to<lb/> make public data they hold. Ride service companies have faced calls for detailed data release that they have<lb/> sometimes accepted. At least one company, Uber, has created an on-line tool, Movement, allowing registered<lb/> users to access some of the data Uber collects. One exception to the general rule of limited data sharing by ride<lb/> services is New York City, where the city&apos;s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) compels ride services to provide<lb/> detailed data analogous to the data that taxis and other traditional ride services must provide. Former New York<lb/> City Deputy Commissioner for Traffic Planning and Taxi-Transportation Network Company (TNC) expert, Bruce<lb/> Schaller, analysed this data and released a report in February, 2017, highlighting what these reveal in terms of<lb/> traffic and other impacts the growth of ride services have had in New York City.<lb/></p>

			<p>Though data are available for taxis, TNCs and other ride services, as of 2016 comparison was difficult because<lb/> reporting requirements were not the same for each category. In particular, taxi data includes pick-up and drop-off<lb/> location, date, time, distance, duration and fares. TNC data, on the other hand, only includes date, time and<lb/> pick-up location, though TNC data for selected months in 2014 and 2015 include trip destination, duration and<lb/> distance. New requirements for TNC reporting will include destination and duration from 2016 on. These data<lb/> discrepancies are important to understand since, in the absence of fully comparable data (especially as regards<lb/> travel distances), the report estimates traffic impacts on the basis of other data sources, including aggregate<lb/> travel distance data gathered from ride service odometer data.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Findings from this analysis indicate that TNCs have become an important and fast-growing part of the city&apos;s<lb/> transportation system. In 2015 and 2016, they have been the leading source of growth in non-auto (i.e.<lb/> non-personal car) travel in the city. They have also added significantly to vehicular travel and mileage on city<lb/> streets. Key findings of the report are:<lb/> <lb/> TNCs transported 15 million passengers per month in Fall 2016 -nearly as many trips as served by the<lb/> city&apos;s yellow cab industry -in 43 000 licensed vehicles.<lb/> <lb/> TNC ridership tripled between June 2015 (the end of the period examined by the City of New York&apos;s<lb/> For-Hire Vehicle Transportation Study) and the fall of 2016.<lb/> <lb/> After accounting for declines in yellow cab, black car and car service ridership, TNCs have generated net<lb/> increases of 31 million trips and 52 million passengers since 2013.<lb/> <lb/> In 2015 and to an even greater extent in 2016, growth in taxi and for-hire ridership outpaced growth in<lb/> transit (subway and bus) ridership and is now the leading source of growth in non-auto travel in New<lb/> York City. This marks a reversal from the transit-oriented growth that lasted from 1990 to 2014.<lb/> <lb/> TNCs accounted for the addition of 600 million miles of vehicular travel to the city&apos;s roadway network<lb/> over the past three years, after accounting for declines in yellow cab mileage and mileage in personal<lb/> vehicles. The additional 600 million miles exceeds the total mileage driven by yellow cabs in Manhattan.<lb/> <lb/> Total mileage of TNCs, yellow cabs, black cars and car services combined increased from 14% to 19% of<lb/> total citywide mileage from 2013 to 2016. (The industry mileage includes transportation of passengers,<lb/> &quot;dead-head&quot; miles between dropping off one passenger and picking up the next passenger, and drivers&apos;<lb/> personal use of driver-owned vehicles.)<lb/></figure>

			<p><lb/> In Manhattan, western Queens and western Brooklyn, TNCs added an estimated 7% to existing miles<lb/> driven by all vehicles, an increase of the same magnitude as the 2007 congestion pricing proposal would<lb/> have decreased vehicle miles travelled (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head><lb/></head>

			<table>Since mid-2015 TNCs have offered and heavily promoted &quot;pooled&quot; options such as UberPool and LyftLine.<lb/> TNC mileage nonetheless continues to grow rapidly because exclusive-ride trips still predominate, and<lb/> because most TNC customers are coming from public transport, walking and biking. Migration from public<lb/> transport translates to increased mileage even if the trips are shared.<lb/> <lb/> Growth in trips, passengers and mileage is seen throughout the city as TNCs attracted yellow cab riders,<lb/> those who would otherwise use the bus, subway or their personal vehicle, and people who would not<lb/> otherwise have made the trip.<lb/> Box 2. Traffic and other impacts of ride services in New York City (continued)<lb/> <lb/> Trip growth in Manhattan has been concentrated during the morning and evening peak periods, when<lb/> yellow cab shift changes produced a shortage of cab availability, and late evenings and weekends when<lb/> passengers may prefer the comfort and convenience of TNCs over yellow cabs or transit services.<lb/></table>

			<p>The report finds that a continuation of the type of TNC-led growth in travel the city has experienced in recent<lb/> years is not aligned with sustainability objectives (mobility, economic growth, road safety, environmental) that the<lb/> city has set. Nonetheless, the correlation the report observes with the rise of ride services and a decline in public<lb/> transport ridership may not necessarily be a causal one as there are other potential explanatory factors. These<lb/> other confounding factors include the drop in gas prices since 2013, which has a well-documented statistical<lb/> relationship with transit ridership and an increase in the prevalence of public transport delays in the city over this<lb/> period. Other issues to consider may be the reports reliance on mode share data for trips that pre-dates the<lb/> uptake of ride services, the degree of pooled ride service share and the possibility that since the bulk of ride<lb/> service growth occurred in the outer, more car-dependent, boroughs of the city, many new ride service trips may<lb/> indeed have disproportionately replaced single occupancy vehicle trips.<lb/></p>

			<p>While these findings are specific to New York, the report does note that there are lessons to be drawn for other<lb/> similar cities. The local context will also matter insofar as specific impacts are concerned. For example, in cities<lb/> with (relatively) low car use and high public transport, cycling and walking, it seems more likely that TNCs will<lb/> lead to a transfer from those modes to car-based TNCs and thus lead to an increase in car travel. In cities with a<lb/> much higher reliance and mode share for single-occupancy car travels, traffic impacts may be less marked as TNC<lb/> riders would switch from single car use to TNC trips.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report identifies a variety of steps to address the rising attractiveness of TNCs while also supporting the<lb/> mobility benefits that TNCs clearly offer. These include many initiatives already underway to improve the speed,<lb/> reliability, comfort and ease-of-use of bus and subway service and the comfort and safety of cyclists and<lb/> pedestrians. The report also finds that continued TNC growth, particularly as that growth becomes increasingly<lb/> fuelled by low fares, will raise the broader issues of road traffic management, including, through the use of road<lb/> pricing.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report notes that New York City authorities have historically used pricing of taxicab fares and parking to<lb/> discourage auto use in Manhattan. As they steadily cut fares, TNCs are erasing these longstanding financial<lb/> disincentives for traveling by motor vehicle in Manhattan. The report suggests that if TNC growth continues at the<lb/> current pace (and it finds there is no sign of it levelling off), the necessity of some type of road pricing will become<lb/> more and more evident.<lb/></p>

			<table>– GETTING AROUND CITIES:THEN, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE…<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> Commercial ride-splitting or ride-pooling<lb/> Some ride-sourcing companies offer commercial ride-splitting, services (e.g. DIDI Hitch, GrabHitch, Lyft<lb/> Line, UberPool). These function are much like ride-sourcing services except that they match multiple,<lb/> unrelated individuals or parties to share the same vehicle over the course of the same ride. Ride-sharing<lb/> algorithms treat ride requests and allocate them in real time to available vehicles such that people get on<lb/> and off along the trip while minimising added travel distance and trip duration – e.g. the &quot; insertion cost &quot; .<lb/> Because insertion costs are contained and overall costs are split, these services provide a less-expensive<lb/> option to ride-sourcing and have proven popular in many markets. In some markets, these pooled ride<lb/> services are cost-competitive with traditional forms of public transport. These services are slightly<lb/> analogous to micro on-demand transit services although they generally remain door-to-door (and not<lb/> route-based) and typically use smaller vehicles. In some cases, access to ride-sharing services has been<lb/> bundled into a monthly subscription package (e.g. Lyft Line and UberPool pass trials).<lb/> Ride companies have tested a number of shared ride services based on fixed routes – for example, Uber&apos;s<lb/> Smart Routes in San Francisco and Chicago and Uber Hop in Seattle. In March, 2017 Lyft announced a trial<lb/> of its fixed-route shared service &quot; Lyft Shuttle &quot; in Chicago and San Francisco. It will offer fixed fares and no<lb/> peak demand surcharges unlike other Lyft Line services. These initiatives indicate that ride service data<lb/> reveals a potential for aggregating riders with common departure zones and destinations into shared fixed<lb/> route lines – operated by cars now but potentially involving minibuses in the future thus shifting towards<lb/> the on-demand micro-transit models described earlier. This shift also reveals potential for hybrid services to<lb/> develop that may be the basis for more formal and structured relationships with public transport operators<lb/> and authorities.<lb/> Maps, routing apps and services<lb/></table>

			<p>Web or app-based mapping services have rapidly become an essential element in urban travel. Initially<lb/> providing mapping and routing information to help plan travel, they now combine real-time data on travel<lb/> conditions, available travel options and, in some cases, allow for remote booking of transport services in<lb/> response to itinerary requests. These apps can be purely third-party providers that consolidate and display<lb/> travel options from a number of other sources in dedicated way-finding apps (e.g. Citymapper, Moovit,<lb/> TransLoc). Map-based platforms like those offered by Apple, Baidu, Bing, Google and Naver have also<lb/> tapped into public transport, ride-service and other mobility provider APIs to offer alternative itinerary<lb/> choices to travellers differentiated by route, cost and travel times. In some cases these third-party apps or<lb/> platforms calculate and offer mixed-mode itineraries that combine public transport with other mobility<lb/> services (e.g. bicycle-sharing and bus, or a ride service and the subway). In-app booking is not restricted to<lb/> mapping and navigation apps. Some social media and communications platforms allow for instant<lb/> ride-service booking from within the chat application (e.g. WeChat in China, KakaoTaxi in Korea). From a<lb/> practical perspective, this consolidation of information on available travel modes, especially when combined<lb/> with a booking option, opens a doorway to more formal service convergence models.<lb/></p>

			<head>Leveraging new possibilities: &quot; Mobility as a Service &quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>Clearly, much of the potential for improved mobility outcomes as compared to today stems from people<lb/> being able to access the whole range of mobility options seamlessly and reliably according to their specific<lb/> trip purposes and requirements, preferences, willingness-to-pay and superior user experience, as well as<lb/> availability of each of those options at the time and place desired by the user. The convergence of and<lb/> co-ordination among services, business models and disparate actors in today&apos;s rapidly evolving mobility<lb/> landscape may lead to a situation where consumers no longer purchase and use vehicles or depend solely<lb/> on providers of traditional public transport services to get around. Rather, people would purchase<lb/> broker-bundled subscriptions of trip services delivered by a number of service providers much as they<lb/> currently purchase bundled internet and telephone subscriptions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The formal concept of &quot; Mobility as a Service &quot; (MaaS), first developed in Finland, encapsulates this approach<lb/> that is gaining traction across some public agencies (e.g. Los Angeles Department of Transport, Helsinki<lb/> Regional Transport Authority). Perhaps more telling is that 9 out of 15 of the world&apos;s largest automobile<lb/> manufacturers (and four out of the top five) have announced a new focus on &quot; mobility services &quot; rather than<lb/> depending only, or sometimes even principally, on vehicle sales and maintenance. In some cases,<lb/> manufacturers have stated that a shift to selling mobility services to consumers will gradually become their<lb/> core strategic focus (e.g. Ford, Daimler, PSA). Other companies beyond the automotive industry have<lb/> announced visions that centre on rolling out fleets of shared and perhaps automated vehicles that will<lb/> obviate the need for car ownership in many cities (e.g. Lyft, Uber and Waymo).<lb/> At its base, MaaS is not strictly a new concept. Examples already exist of bundled mobility packages<lb/> bringing together public transport, car-share, taxi, etc., like those offered in Brussels (MOBIB), Hannover<lb/></p>

			<p>(HANNOVERmobil), Montpellier (EMMA), Vienna (Smile), and across Germany via Moovel or Deutsche<lb/> Bahn&apos;s Qixxit. These packages tend to be regionally negotiated and cover different models and are thus not<lb/> necessarily designed for broad scalability. What is new is the emergence of technology-empowered mobility<lb/> brokers that can define, assemble and offer compelling packages of reliable multi-modal services in a way<lb/> that promises to be as compelling an option as private car ownership.<lb/></p>

			<p>More recently, the city of Gothenburg housed a small MaaS trial project for 70 households from November<lb/> 2013 to April 2014. Participants purchased bundled mobility services from operators allowing them to tailor<lb/> their service packages to their needs – though one result of the trial was that many households had unused<lb/> travel allocations left at the end of every month, perhaps indicating the value of having mobility &quot; on call &quot; ,<lb/> similar to cars that lay unused (<ref type="biblio">Hensher, 2017</ref>). MaaS Global, perhaps the best publicised &quot; new &quot; MaaS<lb/> service, has developed a blueprint for developing mobility as a service packages. This blueprint integrates<lb/> an app-based consumer interface, cross-modal routing algorithms and application programming interfaces<lb/></p>

			<p>(APIs) allowing transport service providers to seamlessly handle bookings and interact within the<lb/> application space. In this context, MaaS Global serves as a technical platform and as a mobility broker<lb/> negotiating the on-boarding of all participating service providers. The company has announced the<lb/> deployment of its first service offers - &quot; Whim &quot; -in Helsinki and the West Midlands in the United Kingdom.<lb/></p>

			<p>An alternative approach adopted by some automotive equipment manufacturers is to deploy a suite of<lb/> vertically integrated services that cover a range of mobility options. This approach is illustrated by Ford&apos;s<lb/> move to federate bicycle-sharing (Bay Area Bike Share), on-demand minibuses (Chariot), and ultimately<lb/> fleets of automated self-driving cars in an enclosed ecosystem. Yet another approach is to offer subscription<lb/> packages to a range of services facilitated on an on-line ride-matching platform. Both Lyft and Uber are<lb/> testing subscription packages in selected markets for their ride-sharing products Lyft Line and UberPool.<lb/></p>

			<p>These and other bundled services are likely to play an important role in the convergence between<lb/> traditional subscription-based public transport packages and new ride services and other emerging mobility<lb/> options.<lb/></p>

			<p>The broad uptake of mobility as a service business models will depend on deploying easy-to-use and<lb/> reliable consumer-facing gateways while at the same time successfully negotiating the back-office<lb/> co-ordination amongst service providers. The back-office challenge is not trivial and is not solely<lb/> technological. The physical production of co-ordinated and joined-up services is a complex task but one that<lb/> is not necessarily difficult to implement. Ensuring reliable service performance is perhaps more complicated<lb/> and requires building-in redundancies or back-up measures (e.g. guaranteed ride services) for when<lb/> services break-down. Handling back-office payment options and negotiating revenue allocation amongst<lb/> participating companies will also be challenging. Perhaps the most daunting task will be to convince people<lb/> 3. Shifting the status quo: Where mobility services and<lb/> public transport are beginning to converge<lb/> Ride-sourcing, commercial ride-sharing and other innovative mobility services have only recently appeared<lb/> in the urban mobility landscape and yet it hasn&apos;t taken long for many to point out the possible synergies<lb/> between these services and other more traditional public transport options. This is in part because the rise<lb/> of the range of innovative mobility options is itself often directly related to some of the shortcomings of<lb/> existing transport options. High costs, long wait times, uncertain quality and limited competitive pressure in<lb/> the taxi sector has contributed to the rise of ride sourcing and ride sharing in many markets, especially at<lb/> times and in areas where public transport performs poorly. Bus services, in particular, have a hard time<lb/> offering quality services in thin markets outside of core routes; a recurrent problem in these markets is to<lb/> provide a sufficiently compelling and affordable (to both consumers and public authorities) alternative to<lb/> single occupancy car use. Public transport services may be reduced to a minimum level of &quot; coverage &quot;<lb/> routes and schedules that provide extremely limited and inconvenient service. The dilemma facing many<lb/> authorities in low-density areas is that car use and car dependency rises, increasing congestion and other<lb/> impacts (even in mid-sized urban areas) which, in turn, puts pressure on authorities to provide sufficiently<lb/> compelling public transport options to attract car drivers. Quite often, such options are unaffordable as<lb/> currently delivered or undeliverable as currently priced.<lb/> So it is understandable that some authorities facing this dilemma have started to experiment with other<lb/> ways of providing the services currently delivered via oftentimes mediocre public transport options and<lb/> indeed, have sought to improve mobility outcomes overall through innovative partnerships. The genesis of<lb/> this convergence between two putatively competitive services comes not solely for the public sector – many<lb/> early initiatives were launched by ride-sourcing companies based on the realisation that a significant share<lb/> of their traffic originates or terminates at public transport stops. Public authorities have been instrumental,<lb/> however, in seeking out more formal partnerships that may eventually mark the urban mobility landscape.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following section looks at a range of experiences in this area as of Spring 2017. Because it catalogues<lb/> where these partnerships have been deployed, it focuses largely on North American examples where many<lb/> of these pilot programmes have been initiated.<lb/></p>

			<head>Promotions, special events and on-off offers<lb/></head>

			<p>At a very basic level, some public transportation operators and agencies have integrated a ride-sourcing or<lb/> commercial ride sharing within their bespoke trip planner applications and web-based portals. Examples<lb/> include Lyft (and Uber, at the outset) offered as an option in Los Angeles Department of Transport Go LA<lb/> app designed by Xerox and in the Dallas Area Rapid Transit trip planning app. These initiatives are<lb/> analogous to those offered by several commercial third-party routing apps described in Chapter 2.<lb/></p>

			<p>Going beyond simply providing an in-app booking option, several initiatives and nascent partnerships have<lb/> focused on providing discount codes for one-off events or promotions linked to public transport services. In<lb/> some instances, these discount codes may help compensate for a temporary lack or loss of service. The<lb/> focus here has often been to get people to start using combined ride-sourcing and public transport trips or<lb/> to ensure that public transport remains a compelling choice even at times when service is infrequent or<lb/> after hours. Many of these promotional offers are limited to specific geographic locales and/or times of day<lb/></p>

			<p>– features that are easy to set up within the platform and deliver to consumers in the app.</p>

Travellers starting or ending trips at<lb/> participating MTS Trolley or Rapid stations could enter a promotion code to receive USD 5 off an<lb/> UberPOOL ride.<lb/> <lb/> During August 2016, Uber put in place the uberTREIN promotion whereby riders received<lb/> discounted trips to and from the airport while the rail corridor linking Schiphol airport to<lb/> Amsterdam was undergoing maintenance. Uber fares were capped at the cost of the train ride<lb/> (EUR 16.80), approximately 30% lower than the un-capped average Uber fare on the same route.<lb/> <lb/> On weekends in December 2016, Australia Capital Territory (ACT) Government and Transport<lb/> Canberra partnered with Uber to ensure late-night, last-mile connections from Night Rider bus<lb/> stops between 22:00 and 2:00. Using in-app geofencing and a promotion code, riders requested<lb/> UberX service from within 20 metres of designated Night Rider stops to any location within one of<lb/> three geographic zones. Qualifying rides received a AUD 10 discount covered half by the ACT<lb/> Government and half by Uber.<lb/> <lb/> Starting in 2015, Uber started offering a one-time USD 20 discount for travellers going to or<lb/> leaving from a MARTA Metro station in Atlanta.

During the same period, Uber also helped distribute (via their drivers) free<lb/> pre-loaded EASY public transport passes to encourage riders to try mixing Uber and Metrorail.<lb/> <lb/> During the closure of the Alaskan Way Viaduct in Seattle in April-May 2016 the Seattle Department<lb/> of Transport partnered with Uber to offer flat-rate USD 2.50 UberHOP (a route-based ride-sharing<lb/> service that was the predecessor to UberPOOL) rides between the central business district and<lb/> South Lake Union as well as to and from a selected group of water taxi stops.<lb/> <lb/> When the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) curtailed late night services on the<lb/> T line in March, 2016, both Lyft and Uber initiated temporary discounts for night ride services to<lb/> and from T stations. For several weeks between 00:30 and 4:00, Lyft offered up to a 75% discount<lb/> for shared Lyft Line rides along the T line and Uber offered a flat USD 5 UberPOOL fare.<lb/> <lb/> The town of Evesham, New Jersey, started a unique programme in October 2015 to cover the cost<lb/> of free rides home with Uber from selected bars, restaurants and other establishments from 21:00<lb/> to 02:00 in a bid to reduce drink-driving.<lb/> In some instances (e.g. Evesham and Seattle), local authorities temporarily helped cover the cost of<lb/> ride-service trips when they met specific conditions.<lb/></table>

			<head>Formal partnerships with public transport involving subsidies and<lb/> integration<lb/></head>

			<p>Many of the promotions described above are time-bound or very limited in their area of application. They<lb/> represent very early experimentation by companies and public authorities seeking synergies between the<lb/> types of services provided by ride-sourcing and commercial ride-sharing companies and public transport<lb/> operators. Many of these initiatives seem to focus more on marketing the notion of combining ride service<lb/> and public transport trips to the public than on replacing certain public transport services with ride services.<lb/></p>

			<p>They do not represent a structural shift in the way public transport is delivered though they do open a<lb/> doorway to exploring further, more formal partnerships. This is what has happened in several jurisdictions<lb/> as described in the following examples.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Altamonte Springs, Florida<lb/> In March of 2016, the City of Altamonte Springs, Florida – a low-density city near Orlando -started a pilot<lb/> programme to subsidise 20% of the cost of every trip beginning and ending within city limits. In addition,<lb/> the city subsidises 25% of the cost of all Uber trips starting or ending at the Altamonte Springs SunRail<lb/> station. In July, 2016, the pilot was expanded to four neighbouring communities.<lb/> Centennial, Colorado<lb/> From August 2016 to February 2017, the City of Centennial ran a six-month pilot programme offering free<lb/> rides to and from the Dry Creek Light Rail Station within a geofenced area. The Go Centennial pilot<lb/> temporarily replaced the Dry Creek Call-n-Ride service with a shared Lyft Line or Via Mobility Service (a<lb/> paratransit service provider) rides. In addition to those ride-service companies, the Go Centennial<lb/> partnership also included the City of Centennial, CH2M, the Denver South Transportation Management<lb/> Association (DSTMA)/Southeast Public Improvement Metropolitan District (SPIMD), and Xerox (Conduent).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The service was accessed through the Lyft app or through the Xerox-developed Go Denver app as well as<lb/> through a call response centre supported by Lyft. Available Monday through Friday from 5:30 to 19:00, the<lb/> pilot sought to increase ridership on the light rail system and decrease car use for accessing the rail station<lb/> or driving to Denver. The programme is currently (<ref type="biblio">Spring 2017</ref>) under evaluation having run its initially<lb/> planned course.<lb/></p>

				<formula>Dublin, California<lb/></formula>

			<p>In early 2016, the Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority (LAVTA) and their transit operator, Wheels,<lb/> started investigating ways to better serve connections between low-density suburban neighbourhoods and<lb/> the East Dublin/Pleasanton BART metro station. Bus service was costly in those areas and in <ref type="biblio">August 2016<lb/></ref> LAVTA shut down an underperforming bus line 1 with an eye to replacing it with ride-sourcing and taxis.<lb/></p>

			<table>In January, 2017, LAVTMA signed agreements with Desoto cab, Lyft and Uber to launch the Go Dublin!<lb/> Rideshare pilot set to initially run through June, 2017. This pilot offers a 50% reduction on all Desoto taxi<lb/> Share, Lyft Line or UberPOOL rides (up to USD 5) taken anywhere within Dublin, including to and from the<lb/> East Dublin/Pleasanton BART metro station. Lyft, Uber and Desoto all offer booking apps that process credit<lb/> card payments and Desoto also allows telephone booking and cash payments. Based on average distances<lb/> and costs, LAVTA estimated its average subsidy coverage required would be USD 5 per trip. Funding for the<lb/> pilot came equally from Wheels (USD 100 000) and from a grant from the Alameda County Transportation<lb/> Commission (USD 100 000).<lb/> Pinellas County, Florida<lb/> In January 2016, the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) expanded a smaller Uber-PSTA pilot<lb/> programme to the entire county and extended it to other ride services and taxi companies, including<lb/> 28 – SHIFTING THE STATUS QUO: WHERE MOBILITY SERVCES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT ARE BEGINNING TO CONVERGE<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> paratransit operators. The expanded Direct Connect service links locations within the county to designated<lb/> bus stops. PSTA estimates users will pay USD 1 on average with the authority covering up to USD 5 per<lb/> ride. The new service covers rides taken with Uber, Lyft, United Taxi, and Care Ride and Wheelchair<lb/></table>

			<p>Transport. The latter two offer specially-equipped paratransit vehicles, the latter three accept telephone<lb/> reservations and United Taxi accepts cash payments. A special promotion offered free bus rides for those<lb/> using the service in its opening month. The Direct Connect pilot is slated to run six months and will be<lb/> re-evaluated. Part of the motivation for the initial pilot was the rejection by local voters of a referendum in<lb/> 2014 that would have helped to fund an expansion of the county&apos;s bus service and build a 24-mile light rail<lb/> system.<lb/></p>

			<head>San Clemente, California<lb/></head>

			<p>In October, 2016, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) started a new exclusive partnership<lb/> with Lyft in low density neighbourhoods previously served by two fixed-service bus routes. The rationale for<lb/> seeking out this arrangement was the high cost of operating the services for too few riders and to free up<lb/> these resources for better service and higher frequencies elsewhere in the OCTA network.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Using an in-app promotion code, riders benefit from reduced-price Lyft fares. Depending on distance, riders<lb/> picked up or dropped off at stops along the old bus route from 6:00 to 20:00 pay USD 2-5 for rides that<lb/> otherwise would have cost USD 5-14 using Lyft&apos;s regular pricing. The City of San Clemente subsidises the<lb/> difference until the approximately USD 100 000 budget allocated for this pilot is exhausted. Additional<lb/> sources of revenue for the programme are being explored by both Lyft and OCTA to extend the pilot&apos;s<lb/> duration. The programme requires using the Lyft app on a smartphone but since not all Orange County<lb/> residents own a smartphone or have an adequate data plan, City officials will help qualifying residents<lb/> purchase government subsidised smartphones. In order to monitor the impact of the pilot, Lyft provides<lb/> monthly ride statistics to OCTA.<lb/> Town of Innisfil, Ontario, Canada<lb/> The town of Innisfil has entered into a partnership with Uber to provide its 36 000 residents guaranteed<lb/> rates and rides through the Uber app. As part of this partnership, the town will provide CAD 100 000 in<lb/> 2017 and CAD 125 000 in 2018. Residents will pay base fees for trips to key locations in Innisfil, and the<lb/> town will pay Uber the balance. For example, Innisfil residents will pay CAD 3 per person for any trip to or<lb/> from the Innisfil Recreational Complex and Town Hall area, and the town will cover the remainder of the<lb/> fare, from CAD 6-9. Residents will also be able to book a trip from Innisfil to anywhere they wish and<lb/> receive CAD 5 off their fare.<lb/> City of Summit, New Jersey<lb/> The City of Summit Commuter Ridesharing Pilot Program, a six-month pilot started in October 2016, covers<lb/> the full cost of Uber rides to or from the Summit light rail station (in fact, to and from a specified pick-up<lb/> and drop-off zone adjacent to the rail station) for Summit residents who have paid their monthly parking<lb/> pass at the rail station. This is because the programme aims to reduce the number of commuter cars left in<lb/> parking lots during workdays. The pilot is limited to 100 participants who are either parking pass<lb/> subscribers or non-parking pass subscribers. Parking pass subscribers receive free trips to and from the<lb/> station and non-parking pass subscribers will be charged a flat USD 2 rate per ride. Because the focus is on<lb/> work commute trips, rides are limited to two per workday per person and from only 5:00 to 21:00.<lb/></figure>

			<table>Partnerships to provide paratransit services: Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority<lb/> The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) has partnered with both Lyft and Uber to offer<lb/> subsidised paratransit trips via each ride service company&apos;s platform during a year-long pilot starting in<lb/> September 2016. Registered users of MBTA&apos;s THE RIDE paratransit service will now be able to book<lb/> on-demand service via their smartphone instead of having to call in advanced reservations. Phone booking<lb/> is also offered for Lyft rides via their call-in centre and Uber is making available a limited number of<lb/> smartphones for qualifying riders. Riders will pay the first USD 2 of the trip with MBTA covering up to USD<lb/> 13 extra; although riders must cover any remaining trip costs, MBTA believes the majority of trips will fall<lb/> within the USD 15 overall rider plus subsidy cost. This compares to rider costs of USD 3.15-5.25 for RIDE<lb/> trips before the pilot and an average trip cost of USD 31.The pilot will offer instantaneous booking and low<lb/> wait times in contrast with minimum one-day advance reservation and one half hour pick-up windows. The<lb/> service covers the greater Boston area with the exception of Logan Airport. Both ride service companies<lb/> offer wheelchair equipped vehicles, Uber through its UberACCESS programme and Lyft through a<lb/> partnership to provide Lyft drivers with wheelchair-accessible rentals. MBTA offers an additional USD 12 per<lb/> completed trip to Lyft drivers renting wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Finally, both Uber and Lyft will provide<lb/> free training to RIDE pilot drivers to help mobility or otherwise impaired customers get into and out of their<lb/> vehicles.<lb/></table>

			<head>Other initiatives<lb/></head>

			<p>Platform-based microtransit: Kutsuplus, Helsinki<lb/></p>

			<p>Kutsuplus was a three-year trial of a pop-up bus service offered by HSL, the Helsinki-Area public transport<lb/> operator. Based on app-ordered minibus services that optimised routes in real-time, the service promised<lb/> flexible, on-demand microtransit in central Helsinki at an attractive price for riders. Trips cost a base fee of<lb/> EUR 1.50 plus an additional EUR 0.15 per direct-route kilometre (due to the nature of the service, actual<lb/> service deviated from the direct route due to additional pick-ups and drop-offs). The project was the first of<lb/> its kind bringing together microtransit and an app-enabled on-demand booking/payment environment but<lb/> ultimately was not renewed in 2016 due to uneconomic performance linked to two design flaws. The first<lb/> was that too few vehicles were deployed and the second was that the trial area was too large. Together,<lb/> this meant that wait times were unacceptably long and the service never gained commercial traction (<ref type="biblio">HSL,<lb/> 2016</ref>). The dispatching algorithm and the app itself were seen as innovative and valuable and the<lb/> IT-company behind both is still involved in other ride-service initiatives.<lb/> Platform-based microtransit: RideKC Bridj, Kansas City<lb/> Bridj was a platform and app-based microtransit service that offered on-demand micro-bus services within<lb/> and between set zones. Users requested service via the app and were directed to a pop-up stop where the<lb/> bus picked them up. The service offered guaranteed seats, free Wi-Fi, no transfers and fewer stops along<lb/> the way. The flexibility of Bridj&apos;s platform, in use in Boston and at least briefly in Washington, DC, led<lb/> Kansas City, Missouri, to develop a pilot program around it to offer new commuter services between areas<lb/> of the city that had been difficult to service with traditional buses. The exact service boundaries are flexible<lb/> and Bridj&apos;s platform allows for real-time adjustments to meet where people are requesting rides.<lb/></p>

			<table>The RideKC pilot ran from March 2016 to March 2017 and built on a partnership between the Kansas City<lb/> Area Transportation Authority (KCATA), Ford Motor Company (for the American Disabilities Act-compliant<lb/> mini-buses) and Bridj for the app-based ride matching platform. The drivers were KCATA drivers that had<lb/> volunteered to participate in the pilot. The service was offered during the morning and evening peak<lb/> commute periods and cost riders USD 1.50 per ride (with the first 10 rides free). The remaining costs were<lb/> covered by KCATA who spent USD 1.3 million on the pilot programme.<lb/></table>

			<p>In the end, the pilot was not extended as it had only generated 1 480 rides over the course of the year – an<lb/> extremely small uptake in a city of more than 2 million people. There were numerous reasons for the pilot&apos;s<lb/> poor performance. Too few people knew about the service – approximately 40% of the people in the pilot<lb/></p>

			<table>30 – SHIFTING THE STATUS QUO: WHERE MOBILITY SERVCES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT ARE BEGINNING TO CONVERGE<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> service areas had not even heard of the service. Rider retention also posed challenges – nearly half of all<lb/> riders only made one trip with the service and only 9% of all riders made 10 trips or more. Reasons for this<lb/></table>

			<p>low retention rate included the fact that services didn&apos;t go where riders wanted to travel or at the times<lb/> they wanted to travel (especially late at night). Riders noted that the service was attractive because it was<lb/> less expensive than alternatives. Survey evidence six months into the pilot found that riders used the<lb/> service instead of a car trip (~30%), a bus trip (~30%) or a ride service (in this case, Uber – ~22%)<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Marshall, 2017; Shaheen et al., 2016c</ref>). KCATA plans to use the lessons learned in the pilot to deploy an<lb/> app-enabled service targeting riders in need of accessible paratransit services at subsidised fares but open<lb/> to all potential riders without fare support.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bridj itself ceased operations in April, 2017 after three years of operations as a result of a cash shortfall<lb/> that resulted when the company was unsuccessful in attracting new capital. Following on the demise of<lb/> Kutsuplus, the closure of Bridj, which had been highlighted as one of the more innovative start-ups in the<lb/> ride-service and public transport field, underscores the difficulty that app-enabled on-demand micro-bus<lb/> shared ride services face at present. Whether the difficulty rests in service design, poor implementation,<lb/> context-specific challenges or fundamental challenges related to this type of ride service model remains to<lb/> be seen.<lb/> Real-estate developer incentive to use ride services with public transport<lb/></p>

			<p>Developers often face costs associated with providing a legally mandated minimum number of parking<lb/> spaces for their properties. It is in their interest therefore to reduce those costs but they will only do so if<lb/> inhabitants or tenants have sufficient alternatives to car use such that the commercial value of the real<lb/> estate does not suffer in the absence of sufficient parking. Maximus Real Estate Partners, the developer of<lb/> ParkMerced in San Francisco, is experimenting with offering residents a USD 100 per month stipend to<lb/> cover multimodal transport, including Uber and public transit. The stated goal of the initiative is to make<lb/> car-free living as easy and convenient as possible. Uber is partnering with ParkMerced by capping uberPOOL<lb/> fares to and from nearby the Daly City BART, Balboa Park BART, and Westportal MUNI public transport<lb/> stations at USD 5.<lb/></p>

			<head>Features of current ride service: Public transport partnerships<lb/></head>

			<p>Though the previous examples show a great diversity in the types of services being offered and the range<lb/> of partners involved, there are a few key characteristics emerging from the admittedly restricted set of<lb/> mostly North American initiatives. The first is that there are a great number of temporary, one-time<lb/> promotions being trialled by both commercial ride service companies and local authorities. These seem<lb/> largely to either serve a particular need for extra capacity due to disruptions to public transport systems<lb/> (e.g. in Seattle and in Amsterdam) or as a way to help travellers learn new behaviours combining ride<lb/> services and public transport. These are interesting in that they allow a lot of creative trialling of services<lb/> but unless they are extended and incorporated into a more formal partnership, they are unlikely to durably<lb/> impact behaviour.<lb/> Most of the more extended formal partnerships between ride services and public transport, with the<lb/> exception of the Boston MBTA&apos;s RIDE paratransit service (and similar initiatives planned in New York City<lb/> and Washington DC), have occurred in smaller, low-density, suburban towns. This is understandable given<lb/> the elevated cost of providing fixed bus service in these geographic contexts and also because of the<lb/> simplicity of organisation and governance at that scale. Because of this, these geographic contexts are<lb/> where these services may naturally develop and possibly be confined. However, ITF analysis from previous<lb/> Corporate Partnership Board reports indicate that exclusive deployment of shared mobility systems has<lb/> potential to handle all trips across entire urban regions with significant benefits (ITF, 2016c). If this were to<lb/> be the case, then the nature of these early pilots, and the regulatory frameworks surrounding their<lb/> deployment, will have to adapt to situations where they potentially play a greater and greater role in<lb/> everyday mobility across wider urban regions.<lb/> All of the initiatives currently underway are organised as pilot programmes. This is to enable learning from<lb/> the exercises and to mitigate some of the potential risk if the pilot does not perform as expected and<lb/> hoped. Pilots allow a safe, time-bound, space for experimentation and ensure that ex-post evaluation<lb/> occurs before the initiative is prolonged, adapted or terminated. Perhaps one of the most compelling<lb/> reasons, however, that these initiatives are run as pilots is that they allow public authorities to enter into<lb/> contractual agreements with service providers without going through typical procurement processes. This is<lb/> due to the limited budget involved which in most instances is below the threshold for formal bid processes<lb/> and due to the temporary nature of the partnerships. In some instances, however (the RIDE partnership in<lb/></p>

			<p>Boston), the pilot is run through a bid-based procurement process. Another aspect of some pilots is that<lb/> they are open in that any provider meeting the criteria can participate (up to the exhaustion of the<lb/> allocated budget if a subsidy is involved). This also allows authorities to test new service configurations<lb/> without going through a formal procurement of exclusive services.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, it is worth noting that the pilots described in this section are embedded in a US-specific public<lb/> transport agency context where funding is generally lacking, where political support for public transport and<lb/> trials are sometimes mixed and where agencies are burdened with constraining procurement processes and<lb/> are generally risk averse.<lb/> US Federal Transit Agency guidance on shared mobility and public transport<lb/> Since many of these experiments are taking place in the United States, the Federal Transit Agency (FTA)<lb/> has issued guidance to local authorities to help them design ride service – public transport partnerships.<lb/></p>

			<p>Issued on 30 January 2017 2 , this guidance takes the form of several frequently asked questions (FAQs)<lb/> seeking to clarify requirements for shared mobility alternatives regarding funding eligibility under federal<lb/> public transportation law for FTA grant programs and compliance with federal requirements, such as the<lb/> Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).<lb/> The FTA defines public transport as &quot; regular, continuing shared-ride surface transportation services that are<lb/> open to the general public or a segment of the general public defined by age, disability or low-income &quot;<lb/> (FTA, 2017), and finds that ride services may qualify for funding depending on the nature of the service<lb/> provided. In particular, FTA makes the distinction between &quot; shared-ride &quot; service and &quot; exclusive ride &quot;<lb/> service. The former are services where open sharing of the ride occurs by design and passengers or drivers<lb/> cannot limit who comes on board if there is capacity, conditioned on certain operational, safety or security<lb/> considerations. Ride services which can be reserved for the exclusive use of individuals or private groups,<lb/> either by the operator or the first passenger&apos;s refusal to permit additional passengers, are considered<lb/> exclusive-ride services (FTA, 2017). Generally, exclusive ride services are not eligible for funding through<lb/> Federal grant programmes (with some limited exceptions where the exclusive ride service is part of a<lb/> specific programme supporting alternatives to public transport – like some job access programmes).<lb/></p>

			<p>Both operational and capital expenditures are allowed for shared ride services. The former may involve<lb/> infrastructure modifications for pick-up and drop-off zones and the latter may involve reimbursing a public<lb/> transport operator or a public agency</p>

			<table>for the costs associated with subsidising first and last-mile access to a<lb/> public transport network using ride services. FTA rules, however, prohibit the direct payment to ride service<lb/> companies.<lb/> The January 2017 guidance also helps US authorities determine how to reconcile Federal requirements<lb/> regarding access for the disabled enacted in the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ride service<lb/> partnerships. Generally, all fixed-route public transport services must be provided with ADA-compliant<lb/> vehicles whereas all non-fixed route services must themselves be ADA-compliant. This distinction means<lb/> 32 – SHIFTING THE STATUS QUO: WHERE MOBILITY SERVCES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT ARE BEGINNING TO CONVERGE<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> that a ride service based on fixed routes must employ vehicles that enable, for example, wheelchair access.<lb/> On-demand services, on the other-hand, must allow convenient, affordable and timely access to<lb/> wheelchair-accessible vehicles though not all vehicles deployed in the service must meet these criteria as<lb/> long as the vehicles have a capacity of less than 16 people including the driver.<lb/> For instance, the services operated by Chariot, described in Chapter 2, use vehicles with a capacity of less<lb/> than 16 people and thus the rules state &quot; the vehicles must be accessible unless the fixed route system,<lb/> when viewed in its entirety, provides equivalent service to persons with disabilities, including wheelchair<lb/> users &quot; (FTA, 2017). In the case of the KACTA-Bridj trial, vehicles were ADA-compliant whereas Bridj&apos;s<lb/> Boston service and Chariot&apos;s services, the overall service, but not necessarily every vehicle, provide &quot; ADA<lb/> equivalent &quot; service. In this context, the service design and the involvement of partners with sufficiently<lb/> large fleets of wheelchair-accessible services, can ensure conformity with ADA requirements. Arguably, the<lb/> flexibility and effectiveness of platform-based ride sourcing allows better deployment and use of the<lb/> accessible fleet as compared to single operator paratransit services. Platform-mediated ADA vehicle<lb/> requests also enable the pooling of adapted vehicles across multiple suppliers. The potential increase in<lb/> efficiency and improvement in wait times and other outcomes are what motivated MBTA to pilot its RIDE<lb/> service with Lyft and Uber in the first place.<lb/> FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT – 33<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> 4. Framing the convergence of ride services and public<lb/> transport<lb/> From public transport to a &quot; Mobility as a Service &quot; ecosystem<lb/></table>

			<p>Public policy is best served when it is framed within a coherent set of visions and goals. This ensures that<lb/> specific initiatives, measures and partnerships contribute to shared and clearly articulated outcomes. This is<lb/> especially important in complex situations where there is a risk that uncoordinated policies may serve<lb/> counter-purposes or even may erode generally shared but poorly articulated objectives. A<lb/> commonly-referenced framework vision also helps ensure consistency and complementarity in investment<lb/> and planning decisions that may span decades. Because it is complex and subject to so many influences,<lb/> urban transport policy is one area where these risks are elevated and the need for correctly framing policy<lb/> is clear.<lb/> Many urban regions, especially in Europe, have a long tradition of carrying out co-ordinated urban mobility<lb/> plans that frame transport decision-making and investment. In France, Germany and certain other<lb/> countries, these plans are required by national law; they must conform to specific methodologies and the<lb/> outcome of the plans are linked to legally enforceable decisions. Outside of Europe, India and Brazil have<lb/> put in place national requirements for urban mobility planning though their implementation remains<lb/> challenging. Many urban regions also create long-term strategic plans in order to help guide transport and<lb/> land-use policy and, in some cases, as in regional metropolitan planning organizations in the United States,<lb/> to help meet requirements in order to gain access to national funding sources.<lb/></p>

			<p>These plans require a lot of input, and may be time-consuming to develop but once completed, serve as a<lb/> common reference until they are updated or replaced. There is a risk in this context that these plans may<lb/> not adequately address fast-changing circumstances and emerging phenomena. This seems to be the case<lb/> with the treatment of innovative mobility services, the potential impact of automated driving and how<lb/> digitally-driven changes may fundamentally challenge the concept of public transport. Plans that address<lb/> these issues and provide guidance in dealing with uncertainty regarding the way in which urban transport<lb/> ecosystems will evolve can frame policy addressing the evolution of public transport. The city of</p>

			<table>Los<lb/> Angeles&apos; Urban Mobility Plan in a Digital Age, for example, illustrates one such comprehensive and<lb/> future-proof vision-setting exercise (see Box 3). Another good example is Finland&apos;s Strategic Growth<lb/> Environment Plan For Digital Transport that also addresses multimodal regulatory and market access<lb/> issues, and data accessibility; it paves the way to automation and nationwide Mobility as a Service<lb/> platform.<lb/></table>

			<p>The convergence of public transport and emerging mobility services opens up innovative mobility options<lb/> for many people. The upside potential of this convergence is difficult to realise under traditional public<lb/> transport service delivery models. This is because that potential rests on leveraging synergies between<lb/> legacy systems and emerging technologies, between operators that may display considerable institutional<lb/> inertia and more agile new players and because the very service being &quot; produced &quot; by public transport<lb/> operators may no longer represent the best option for delivering satisfactory outcomes to travellers in<lb/> certain circumstances.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the very top level, reforming governance structures for transport services should as much as possible<lb/> seek to gather responsibility for all aspects of transport service provision under one coherent framework.<lb/> This may be a specific agency or an oversight committee that sets objectives and policies, in some cases<lb/> carries out operations or licensing/contracting, monitors outcomes and follows up with adjustments as<lb/> necessary.<lb/></p>

			<table>– FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> One of the first challenges facing authorities will be to re-evaluate what constitutes public transport, what<lb/> outcomes authorities should work towards and how to ensure that these outcomes are aligned with what<lb/> people want. Equitable access will be part of the equation, as will efficiency improvements that deliver cost<lb/> savings – but the fundamental building blocks of this vision should be structured around the provision of a<lb/> compelling user experience irrespective of service delivery mode or operator. Initiatives to facilitate<lb/> mode-agnostic Mobility as a Service ecosystems will be important and will require re-visiting and possibly<lb/> adapting many of the rules and governance structures that frame urban transport policy.<lb/> Box 3. Los Angeles&apos; vision for a digitally-enabled transport system<lb/></table>

			<p>Urban Mobility in a Digital Age is a transportation technology strategy that is meant to guide the City of Los<lb/> Angeles and its Department of Transportation (LADOT) as regulator and transportation service provider in a<lb/> complex and evolving ecosystem of public and private services. It focuses on building a solid data foundation,<lb/> leveraging technology and design for a better customer experience, creating partnerships for more complimentary<lb/> shared services, establishing feedback loops for services and infrastructure, and preparing for an automated<lb/> future. Urban Mobility for a Digital Age seeks to position LADOT as a platform for mobility innovation that supports<lb/> better transport options by targeting three impact goals:<lb/></p>

			<p>Goal 1: Data as a Service<lb/> LADOT must be able to provide and receive real-time data from an increasingly complex marketplace of public and<lb/> private transportation service providers, other jurisdictions, and connected and automated vehicles to maximise<lb/> the efficiency and safety of the road and transportation networks. This requires a seamless data exchange with a<lb/> variety of partners and stakeholders, privacy and security protections, the capacity to analyse data from a variety<lb/> of resources, and the ability to integrate this insight into a data-driven decision-making process at the level of<lb/> elected officials and department management.<lb/></p>

			<p>Goal 2: Mobility as a Service<lb/> Mobility as a Service seeks to develop a single platform and payment system that offers access to a suite of<lb/> transportation mode choices, often bundled together in packages in order to improve transport outcomes for<lb/> people. LADOT has already partnered to make it easier for customers to evaluate transportation options through a<lb/> trip planning application, Go LA, which compares mode options for the fastest, cheapest and/or greenest routes.<lb/> Additionally, LADOT has piloted a mobile payment application for its transit services and there are plans to expand<lb/> Go LA to include reservation and payment capabilities in Summer 2016. LADOT is committed to being a leading<lb/> advocate for expanded access through a series of actions to better connect and integrate the existing marketplace<lb/> of public and private services.<lb/></p>

			<p>Goal 3: Infrastructure as a Service<lb/></p>

			<p>Infrastructure as a Service proposes that the use of public infrastructure should be subject to pay-as-you-go user<lb/> fees that more closely align the costs associated with providing the infrastructure itself to how the infrastructure is<lb/> being used. Infrastructure as a Service more transparently reflects the costs to build, maintain and operate public<lb/> infrastructure by charging fees for this service. With a solid data baseline, this approach can also support tiered<lb/> fees to ensure there is equity in access to the public right-of-way. Infrastructure as a Service can help shift<lb/> behaviour by incentivising shared mobility, promoting staggered commute times and other active transportation<lb/> alternatives.<lb/> Source: Adapted from LADOT (2016).<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparing mobility services and public transport<lb/></head>

			<p>The innovative mobility services outlined in Chapter 2 help people travel without needing to own a car. As<lb/> with good quality public transport, these services help make it as easy to live without a car as with one –<lb/> and in some cases, more easily.

			<p>Perhaps the most fundamental difference between public transport and the business models of many<lb/> emerging mobility providers is that the provision of public transport is almost always seen as necessary to<lb/> provide a minimal level of service to a portion of the population. At the same time, where markets are<lb/> sufficiently dense and the context supports it, high-quality public transport is also perhaps the only way to<lb/> provide access-improving mobility efficiently and affordably. For both of these reasons, public authorities<lb/> strictly regulate public transport while, at the same time, accept paying for the broader services it provides<lb/> beyond what is covered by farebox revenues. Public authorities consider these payments necessary in order<lb/></p>

			<head>36 – FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT<lb/></head>

			<p>SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> to sustain minimum service coverage, to keep fares affordable for those that depend on public transport<lb/> and because they consider that public transport delivers external benefits.<lb/> This is a quite different approach from the way that many emerging mobility services have been treated in<lb/> public discourse and in policy-making. Initially, few authorities saw these services as threatening public<lb/> transport and its various missions. However, as taxi markets are increasingly disrupted by ride service<lb/> companies, there is an increasing realisation that public transport may be next and that authorities must<lb/> re-evaluate their stance on the whole mobility ecosystem in a unified and coherent manner. There are<lb/> many reasons that this will not necessarily be straightforward, not least of which is that some see emerging<lb/> mobility services, and ride services in particular, as increasingly competing in the same space as public<lb/> transport (and potentially for certain pedestrian and cycling trips).<lb/></p>

			<head>Managing competition between innovative mobility services and<lb/> traditional public transport<lb/></head>

			<p>A recurrent fear raised in discussions surrounding the convergence of public transport and ride services is<lb/> that the latter will cannibalise the former, drawing away riders (especially &quot; premium &quot; riders) and revenues,<lb/> and ultimately eroding the capability for public transport to provide quality services and contribute to<lb/> equitable outcomes. This, if true, would certainly counter stated policy objectives for many public<lb/> authorities and would require strong action to prevent such a loss. This framing of the question – ride<lb/> services and public transport competing for a uniform, fixed and possibly even shrinking market, however,<lb/> belies the reality in many cities.<lb/></p>

			<p>In low-density and thin bus markets, many public transport operators are struggling to offer services that<lb/> are competitive with car use. In those areas, those who can afford cars, who find them a more convenient<lb/> option to low-frequency, inflexible bus services and who can safely operate them have already largely<lb/> abandoned bus services – even if these services may feed into higher frequency and better quality public<lb/> transport networks. Those bus users who remain are often captive users who have few alternatives.<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted earlier, not all trips are the same and many are quite expensive to supply via traditional, often<lb/> bus-based, services. In these contexts, ride services can be (and have been) seen as a way to deliver the<lb/> same trips as those delivered by some bus services but at lower overall costs. This motivation – to use ride<lb/> services as a way to reduce public transport operating costs and subsidies in thin markets – seems largely<lb/> to have been the motivation for several recent trials like those described in the previous chapter. It is<lb/> important to note, however, that these cost savings are driven by the shift to more variable cost factors,<lb/> including labour, which can be directly matched with any revenue gained from operations. Ride service<lb/> models clearly leverage capital cost savings from switching from large public transport vehicles sized for<lb/> peak demand to smaller vehicles that can more flexibly handle most demand. Ride services also benefit<lb/> from lower variable costs savings related to lower labour-related costs. These result from most ride services<lb/> employing a business model that depends on using independent, oftentimes less trained and sometimes<lb/> less skilled drivers in place of full-time, generally more skilled and organised labour. With the collective<lb/> bargaining power of the latter also comes defined benefits, including pensions, that independent contractors<lb/> lack. There are exceptions to this rule, for example KCATA&apos;s use of the agency&apos;s unionised bus drivers for<lb/> the Bridj pilot described in the previous section.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cost savings are therefore an important motivation for seeking to replace certain expensive public transport<lb/> routes with ride services. They are also an important motivator for early action as they provide a tangible<lb/> reason to act. But going forward, it is not clear that cost savings are either a sufficient motivation or even a<lb/> major motivation for seeking better synergies between ride services and public transport – at least where<lb/> there is a desire to improve mobility and access outcomes for as broad a group as possible. That is because<lb/> these synergies, if well managed, can be leveraged to provide improved outcomes for travellers while at the<lb/></p>

			<p>same time allowing public authorities to deliver on important public policy objectives such as improved<lb/> equity, reduced congestion and improved environmental outcomes.<lb/> One key factor to consider is that replacing more expensive, less demand-responsive and less flexible public<lb/> transport services with less expensive, more demand-responsive and more flexible ride services or other<lb/> combinations of innovative mobility services can free funds that public transport operators could allocate to<lb/> improving the quality of core services. Under this framing of the question, the potential for ride services<lb/> and other innovative mobility options to draw away riders from specific routes does not necessarily imply<lb/> that overall ridership would drop. In fact, if core services are improved and the convenience of using public<lb/> transport as part of a trip chain increases, then overall ridership may even increase. In the broader picture,<lb/> adding a more convenient mobility choice into the mix may improve overall access and mobility outcomes<lb/> even as it reduces the need to own a car.<lb/></p>

			<p>A recent survey of the trip behaviour of users of ride-sourcing and other emerging mobility services in the<lb/> United States indicates that this potential is real though the extent of this synergy – especially if ride<lb/> services significantly increase their overall mode share – is uncertain. According to (<ref type="biblio">Feigan and Murphy,<lb/> 2016</ref>), those who use emerging mobility services – and especially those who use many of these services in<lb/> conjunction with each other – are likely to be heavy users of public transport as well. This is partly a result<lb/> of lower car ownership amongst this subset of the population. The survey also found that use of innovative<lb/> mobility services often complements public transport use (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) – but that at certain times of the<lb/> day and for certain trips, these modes compete for the same riders. Ride services are most used for<lb/> non-work trips, especially recreational trips, and off-peak hours – especially at night. These are precisely<lb/> the types of trips that public transport operators find impossible to provide or that are extremely costly to<lb/> do so. Public subsidies to operators disproportionately cover these low frequency services in thin markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Replacing these trips with less costly and possibly more convenient options could also free up public<lb/> resources for other uses.<lb/></p>

			<p>In other related studies, Feigan and Murphy (2016) found that bicycle-sharing in the United States often<lb/> serves to access or to extend public transport trips and that car sharing typically occurs in off-peak hours<lb/> for non-work trips. According to the survey, car-sharing and ride-services were generally seen as competing<lb/> more with taxi and private car use than with public transport.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is admittedly insufficient empirical evidence on the impact of ride services and other innovative<lb/> mobility options on public transport ridership, especially outside of North America. Even if there were, it<lb/> would be difficult to generalise at this stage on how this impact, either positive or negative, might evolve as<lb/> more and more people use ride services. But at present, there seems to be evidence that in certain<lb/> contexts – especially where the provision of public transport services is expensive and quality is low –<lb/> well-targeted policy to replace certain poorly-performing and expensive bus services may indeed increase<lb/> the overall attractiveness of public transport. In these cases, public authorities and public transport<lb/> operators can start to evaluate where these synergies are strongest by undertaking inventories of existing<lb/> public transport routes and services to evaluate the potential for alternative service delivery models –<lb/> including those based on co-operation with ride services. These inventories would be best served by<lb/> seeking improvements in overall outcomes rather than only looking solely at cost savings.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Further evidence-based analysis of the interaction effects between ride services and public transport, and<lb/> the overall impact on mobility outcomes can also help guide policy-making in this area. This will require<lb/> perhaps more information from rides services than they have typically provided in the past (we discuss data<lb/> and performance indicator frameworks later) but can lead to better framed policy discussions.<lb/> 38 – FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT<lb/> Figure 4. Uber pick-ups and drop-offs (blue) within a quarter mile of suburban rail services (black) in<lb/> Portland, Oregon<lb/> Source: Uber (2017).<lb/> The investigation of employee shuttle services between San Francisco and Silicon Valley is one example of<lb/> this type of evidence-based investigation of the impacts of innovative mobility services. Prior to 2014, a<lb/> number of bus and mini-bus based employee shuttles proliferated throughout the city bringing workers in<lb/> the tech industry from their residences in San Francisco to their places of employment in Silicon Valley.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Individual companies organised entire networks of routes and stops using public street infrastructure,<lb/> including marked loading areas and public transport stops, and thus offered a &quot; shadow &quot; public transport<lb/> network that rivalled that of established services (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). These private shuttles were controversial<lb/> in that boarding and off-loading hampered public bus service and disrupted traffic due to inconsistent<lb/> enforcement and confusing rules, or the lack thereof. Many felt that these shuttles not only drew riders<lb/> away from existing public transport services eroding their revenue base but that the shuttles also prioritised<lb/> the travel of relatively better-paid tech workers over more captive users of traditional public transport.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Starting in January 2014, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) initiated a pilot<lb/> program that streamlined and enforced rules and monitored performance in co-operation with shuttle<lb/> operators. The programme found that while 29% of the shuttle riders would otherwise have used public<lb/> transport to get to work, nearly half (47%) would have driven alone to work along an already very<lb/> congested route. While the employee shuttle fleet did draw some riders away from public transport, it drew<lb/> many more people out of cars and thus had a positive impact on peak hour traffic. This analysis led SFMTA<lb/> to recommend that the shuttles be allowed to operate albeit under tighter regulatory control to ensure as<lb/> little impact as possible on public bus services in San Francisco (SFMTA, 2015). Such an open-ended,<lb/> flexible and evidence-based trialling of new rules could also be a model for authorities seeking synergies<lb/> between ride services and public transport.<lb/> FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT – 39<lb/> Figure 5.

			<head>Adopting governance structures aligned with the range of mobility<lb/> services on offer<lb/></head>

			<p>The governance of public transport, and of transport services more generally, will play an essential role in<lb/> either facilitating or impeding the convergence of traditional and innovative mobility services – and of ride<lb/> services in particular. In the first instance, the licensing of innovative mobility services and their regulation<lb/> is a role conferred to governments. These roles may be unified within one level of government or agency<lb/> but in many instances it may be spread across several levels (national, regional or local). Even at any given<lb/> level, responsibility may be spread across several departments or services with little top-level co-ordination.<lb/> This complicates the task of aligning outcomes in, say, the regulation of ride services that may fall under<lb/> those in charge of taxi or for-hire regulations and public transport regulation which may fall under a<lb/> completely different authority.<lb/> Secondly, initiating outreach to ride services typically comes from public authorities or public transport<lb/> operators and in many instances, this may be stymied by internal resistance to what may be perceived as<lb/> direct or unfair competition with public transport services. It may also be difficult since, under the current<lb/> framework of public transport provision, the less regulated ride service sector may be seen as running<lb/> counter to the public service component of existing services. If transport governance structures contribute<lb/> to this friction, it may be very difficult to even broach the subject of synergies between ride services and<lb/> public transport, let alone experiment with them. This is certainly the case where, for any number of<lb/> reasons, new ride services are prevented from operating or face constraining conditions. At a very basic<lb/> level, split responsibility and split levels of decision-making may hamper the trialling of innovative new<lb/> arrangements.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a great diversity of governance structures for public transport around the world and the enactment<lb/> of this governance rests on a wide variety of legal arrangements. These may include authorisations,<lb/> licences, concessions, contracts or hybrid arrangements built on multiple instruments. Because of this<lb/> diversity, it is hard to generalise on what seems to be the most effective form of transport governance,<lb/> especially since this diversity generally rests on local or regional characteristics. Nonetheless, there are<lb/> three broad service delivery models around the world that necessitate slightly different governance<lb/> structures.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first model is characterised by a privatised public transport operator that has significant freedom to<lb/> make operational decisions and strategic investments. These operators may be fully privatised, as in the<lb/> case of the Tokyu Corporation providing metropolitan rail services in the Tokyo region, or may consist of<lb/> operators established as private companies with public shareholders, as in the case of the Mass Transit<lb/> Railway (MTR) Corporation that operates rail and bus services in Hong Kong. These types of arrangements<lb/> have led to a certain degree of innovation with regards to funding models that generate revenue from<lb/> commercial services and real estate linked to public transport networks. Such operators have a strong focus<lb/> on the profitability of their services and have extremely limited recourse to public subsidies. Because they<lb/> run generally profit-clearing services, the cost-savings attraction of partnering with innovative mobility<lb/> services may not be very compelling. But there is room for seeking out partnerships to improve certain<lb/> operational aspects of services – especially if they attract riders out of congested networks at peak times.<lb/> A second, relatively widespread model, for the organisation of public transport is one where the operator is<lb/> fully under the direct control of a government body and indeed may even be a government agency.<lb/> Self-provided services are common feature in North America and, to a lower extent, elsewhere. These types<lb/> of operators have generally emerged from the privatisation of commercial operators when these lost market<lb/> share in the face of rising car use.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rationale for bringing public transport under direct government control was to ensure the provision of<lb/> minimum levels of service, coverage and controlled fares as a safety net to ensure mobility for those unable<lb/> or unwilling to use cars. These types of operators are governed directly by regional/local transport<lb/> authorities who define the level of service, fares and coverage. In some instances, national authorities also<lb/> set requirements for these operators, especially in return for payments and subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the United States, government agencies and operators delivering public transport services have been<lb/> among the first to seek out partnerships with ride services and other innovative mobility operators as<lb/> outlined in Chapter 3. However, this model may harbour some inherent tensions in that officially partnering<lb/> with innovative mobility operators, especially those that have limited or no public service obligations, may<lb/> be seen as running counter to the agency mission. This is one of the reasons the US Federal Transit<lb/> Administration has issued guidance on the matter. Because of this inherent tension, the scalability of<lb/> public-private partnerships bringing together public transport with other mobility services may be<lb/> compromised beyond a limited set of innovators and small-to medium-sized pilot programmes.<lb/> A third common model, especially prevalent in Europe (but not exclusively:</p>

			<table>Los Angeles and Portland are<lb/> North American examples) is one where transport authorities define the strategic and tactical objectives for<lb/> public transport but the actual operation of these services is contracted out to independent operators. As<lb/> described by the UITP, &quot; Organising Authorities are organisations which act in the public interest to ensure a<lb/> FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT – 41<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> well-functioning, attractive, and integrated transport system. They provide the framework for successful<lb/> public transport directed at economic, social, and environmental value for citizens and business &quot; (UITP,<lb/> 2009). Conceptually, this model provides greater flexibility for integrating new types of services into the<lb/> urban mobility mix. FlexDanmark&apos;s Flex Traffic platform is one example of this type of approach for<lb/> integrating on-demand services (see Box 1).<lb/></table>

			<p>In Europe, this model typically revolves around a competent authority at a regional or metropolitan level<lb/> that establishes public service contracts with operators to carry out transport operations. The authority is<lb/> not a public transport operator but, as described in a report from the New Cities Foundation, is a &quot; mobility<lb/> orchestrator &quot; establishing a mix of contract-based mobility options for the region (Lindsay, 2016). These<lb/> contracts are subject to public tender and the operators may be commercial entities or publicly-owned<lb/> companies. European legislation allows for exemptions to the tendering process where the operator is<lb/> owned by the authority and where such exemptions are not prohibited by national law. In those cases,<lb/> strict legal obligations on payment, performance and service quality frame the contract.<lb/></p>

			<p>Because the responsibility for goal-setting and oversight is split from operations and service delivery, this<lb/> type of model intuitively makes sense for contracting out or procuring services from ride companies. Some<lb/> of the inherent conflicts that may need to be overcome in the previous two models are not necessarily<lb/> present and the potential contribution of ride services to an overall vision and objectives for transport can<lb/> be more objectively assessed and acted upon. This is in theory at least, because in practice, public<lb/> transport organising authorities in Europe have been particularly loathe to seek out partnerships with ride<lb/> services and most of the innovation in this field comes from North America. This may stem from the<lb/> strength and effectiveness of traditional public transport service in European countries as well as from an<lb/> institutional bias in favour of traditional public transport service delivery models. Yet, even in metropolitan<lb/> areas with well-functioning public transport networks, operators must often cross-subsidise lower<lb/> performing routes with revenues derived from core services. Innovation in service delivery in those markets<lb/> may increase the overall function of the network and improve customers&apos; outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Current public transport service procurement practices and ride services<lb/></head>

			<p>Because many partnerships between public transport agencies and rides services are currently run as trials<lb/> or on a small scale, they don&apos;t necessarily require completely revisiting procurement rules or contracting<lb/> practices. If these arrangements are to scale up or become an integral part of the transport options<lb/> overseen by public contracting agencies, adjustments will likely be required to procurement. It is probably<lb/> too early at this stage to specify what form or forms those contracts and practices should take and the<lb/> diversity of local conditions would suggest that multiple models may emerge – much as they have for the<lb/> contracting of public transport services. Further experimentation with procurement rules may even be<lb/> beneficial as long as risks are identified and contained.<lb/> Generally, however, a few elements in the procurement/contracting framework for public transport will<lb/> need to be adjusted – especially as concerns public service contracts. Public service contracts establish the<lb/> rights and obligations of both transport authorities contracting services and the operator providing those<lb/> services. They typically cover a wide range of aspects relevant to the delivery of fixed route public transport<lb/> services as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Not all of these areas are necessarily relevant for the oversight of<lb/> public-private partnerships (where the public transport operator is a public agency or under its effective<lb/> control and where the ride service operator is a commercial venture) to deliver ride services in conjunction<lb/> with, or as a replacement for, public transport. In particular, public service contracts typically specify the<lb/> quantity of services to be provided (in terms of frequency, coverage, vehicles, etc.), may grant exclusivity<lb/> of fixed routes, set fares, specify how revenue is to be allocated and identify responsibilities for<lb/> infrastructure investments in return for payments or subsidies for service from the public authority. These<lb/></p>

			<table>– FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/></table>

			<p>contract components do not necessarily apply to the provision of ride services as they are typically<lb/> characterised by routeless networks (with the exception of some microtransit services), fares and revenues<lb/> are normally the sole responsibility of the ride service (though the difference between the public-facing<lb/> price and the full cost to the ride service may be part of the contract since this determines the level of<lb/> public subsidy) and no infrastructure expenditure. Ride service contracts may grant exclusivity to ride<lb/> service platforms or operators and may specify a geographic scope where the contract and its provisions<lb/> are enabled.<lb/> How contracts and procurement rules specify quality objectives for ride services will likely diverge from<lb/> traditional bus and rail-based public transport. The latter typically look at specifying operational aspects of<lb/> service provision: on-time performance, availability of service, location of stops and even detailed<lb/> schedule-based frequency. These are adapted to the type of services route-based bus and rail services<lb/> provide but make little sense for platform-based ride services. Coverage of services, average wait times<lb/> (and their distribution) for both regular services and for accessible services, for example, all focus more on<lb/> the outcomes that ride services can contribute to and may be more relevant for contracting with the<lb/> providers of ride services.<lb/> An additional element to consider is the allocation of risk in contracting arrangements. Currently, most of<lb/> the pilots looking at the delivery of ride services allocate risk to the public authority contracting the service.<lb/></p>

			<p>Authorities accept this since they realise substantial cost savings with these arrangements as compared to<lb/> their prior arrangements. This may need to evolve.<lb/></p>

If these investments do not provide expected<lb/></table>

			<p>value, the public may feel authorities have squandered taxpayer revenues. This limits the ability for<lb/> authorities to seek innovative arrangements that may only provide uncertain, or at least, untested value at<lb/> the outset. Public-private partnerships typically seek to balance risk amongst both parties but are often<lb/> seen as a way to unload risk to private enterprises in return for which they are compensated through<lb/> beneficial revenue allocation arrangements. The treatment of risk, both on the cost and on the revenue side<lb/> is important to consider when looking at the future potential for linking ride services to public transport. In<lb/> most (temporary) initiatives reviewed here, much of the risk is borne by the contracting public agency or<lb/> authority.<lb/> Risk on the cost side is relatively contained for ride service operators and the platforms they operate, and<lb/> the remittances they provide drivers are largely covered by general revenues they derive from their<lb/> commercial services. While there may be some debate on just how profitable different ride service models<lb/> are, the services they provide in conjunction with public transport options remains a minuscule part of their<lb/> overall costs. In some cases operators do invest in dedicated services and facilities as Lyft has done in<lb/> order to provide or pay for call centres. These costs are covered by the ride services. Risk on the cost side<lb/> for public agencies is also contained since most of the services to-date are time bound pilots with fixed<lb/> budgets for subsidy payments – once the money runs out, so too does the service unless additional funds<lb/> are allocated through the budget process. And the pilots typically allow public agencies and operators to<lb/> enact sometimes substantial cost savings.<lb/> Revenue risk is also relatively well contained, since costs are generally contained and marginal revenues<lb/> cover additional services generated through the pilot programmes. Revenue estimates also oftentimes<lb/> correctly assume a rise in ridership linked to the greater convenience and contained costs of services<lb/> offered – especially in comparison to the pre-existing public transport-alone offer.<lb/></p>

			<p>While risks are contained by design in the case of the pilots described previously, this may not hold true as<lb/> services scale up and are extended to a broader field of application. In this case, alternative risk mitigation<lb/> structures may be necessary on the public side. Innovation management is not limited to efforts seeking to<lb/> reconfigure the provision of mobility services; it is something public agencies are facing across a broad<lb/> spectrum of fields including broadband access, water services and housing, for instance. In these instances,<lb/> it may be worthwhile to think about alternative structures that enable sustainable risk-taking in public<lb/> governance.<lb/></p>

			<p>One possible approach is to mimic the portfolio approach adopted by many venture capital firms. These<lb/> firms invest in a broad range of potential new businesses with the expectation that many will fail -<lb/>sometimes quickly; lessons will be learnt and incorporated into new business models and eventually, a<lb/> sufficient number of ideas take hold and generate adequate returns to sustain and grow the overall portfolio<lb/> value.<lb/></p>

			<p>A slightly analogous &quot; innovation finance agency &quot; or &quot; urban mobility lab &quot; could help bring this type of<lb/> approach to public expenditures in the field of urban mobility innovation. Under this framework, the<lb/> independent agency might pool public and private monies with an eye to investing in a wide range of<lb/> innovative services with the expectation that many will fail leading to higher and higher skill and that this,<lb/> in return, will ensure that some projects succeed, maximise overall return on taxpayer investments and<lb/> lead to innovative new offers. This approach likely falls outside of the comfort level of many public agencies<lb/> but some are starting to investigate governance models to help generate innovative services. For example,<lb/> Metro, Los Angeles&apos; public transport operator, has put in place a programme to receive, evaluate and act<lb/> upon (if needed) completely unsolicited innovative ideas from the public and from the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<figure><lb/> Enhance transit industry preparedness for MOD.<lb/> <lb/> Assist the transit industry to develop the ability to integrate MOD practices with existing transit service.<lb/> <lb/> Validate the technical and institutional feasibility of innovative MOD business models and document MOD<lb/> best practices that may emerge from the demonstrations.<lb/> <lb/> Measure the impacts of MOD on travellers and transportation systems.<lb/></figure>

			<p><lb/> Examine relevant public sector and federal requirements, regulations and policies that may support or<lb/> impede transit sector adoption of MOD.<lb/></p>

			<p>Eligible activities include all those leading to the demonstration of the innovative MOD and transit integration<lb/> concept, such as planning and developing business models, obtaining equipment and service, acquiring/developing<lb/> software and hardware interfaces to implement the project, and operating the demonstration. Eligible recipients<lb/> are providers of public transportation, including public transit agencies, state/local government DOTs, and<lb/> federally recognised Indian tribes. Each recipient must identify one or more strategic project partner(s) with a<lb/> substantial interest and involvement in the project. These partners may include private for-profit and not-for-profit<lb/> organizations, including shared use mobility providers, and technology system suppliers; operators of<lb/> transportation services, such as employee shuttle services, airport connector services, university transportation<lb/> systems, or parking and tolling authorities; State or local government entities; and other organisations that may<lb/> contribute to the success of the project team including consultants, research consortia or not-for-profit industry<lb/> organisations, and institutions of higher education.<lb/> Source: Adapted from FTA (2016).<lb/></p>

			<p>Another approach to manage more &quot; risky &quot; initiatives is to use dedicated funds and programmes to<lb/> incentivise innovative projects. The United States Department of Transport has used this approach in its<lb/> &quot; Smart City &quot; Grant programme and its Federal Transit Agency uses a similar approach in its Mobility on<lb/></p>

			<p>Demand (MOD) Sandbox programme (see Box 4). This program provides up to 80% matching federal funds<lb/> (up to the programme budget of USD 8 million) for innovative new integrated mobility-on-demand concepts<lb/> and solutions. The goal of the programme is to investigate how public transport agencies can develop<lb/> synergies with, and best manage the disruption caused by, emerging innovative mobility services.<lb/></p>

			<p>A final risk category to consider is that posed by the &quot; lock-in &quot; of a particular service provider through public<lb/> agency contracts. Single-provider contracts may make sense but these raise risks of monopolistic behaviour<lb/> and may prevent more innovative services or providers from entering markets. These risks can be<lb/> mitigated in a number of ways, for example by shortening the contract period, putting in place<lb/></p>

			<figure>FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT – 45<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/></figure>

			<p>performance-based contracting with bonuses and penalties for meeting/surpassing or falling short of<lb/> objectives or splitting the market. Another approach to consider, especially when public authorities provide<lb/> payments or subsidies for services is to put in place user-side subsidies which allow the private sector to<lb/> innovate and seek out users who then allocate public funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>Leveraging government assets to guide convergence<lb/></head>

			<p>Public authorities control a substantial amount of infrastructure that can be used or re-configured to help<lb/> guide the convergence of ride services and public transport. Preferred access to managed lanes, priority<lb/> given to commercial ride sharing vehicles in publicly owned parking facilities and reconfiguring public street<lb/> space for pick-up and drop-off zones are all areas where public action can help leverage ownership of<lb/> infrastructure to support a greater diversity of mobility options.<lb/></p>

			<p>One issue to consider is that many local authorities derive revenue from infrastructure, especially from<lb/> parking. A move towards greater reliance on ride services and public transport will likely reduce parking<lb/> revenues, or at least shift where these are generated. This is in itself not a problem if the costs borne by<lb/> the public sector also decrease obviating the need for that revenue. But if cost recovery is still required on<lb/> the part of public authority, it is unlikely that revenue derived from storing inactive vehicles will suffice if a<lb/> rising share of vehicles provide ride services and therefore only stop briefly at the curb.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this context, new revenue models may be needed – such as a &quot; kerb-kiss &quot; fee levied for pick-up or<lb/> drop-off at the kerb applicable to all vehicles (ride services, public transport, goods delivery, etc.) but this<lb/> would suppose a technological platform able to track and correctly charge these fees in a trustworthy and<lb/> transparent manner. This may be easier to do at some point in the future, especially with a greater<lb/> penetration of potentially fully-automated vehicles, but it is worth starting to investigate these models<lb/> already today.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another aspect to consider from the public transport operator side is that parking connected to certain<lb/> stations may also be a constrained resource. In these cases, operators may need to invest significant<lb/> resources to increase parking capacity for stations servicing extended and low-density catchment areas. As<lb/> some of the cases outlined in Chapter 3 indicate, partnering with ride services to provide better car-based<lb/> connectivity to these stations may be in the operator&apos;s best interest as this solution can help increase<lb/> ridership on core services while obviating the need to invest in expensive parking capacity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monitoring outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted earlier, there is insufficient reliable evidence on the impacts of joining ride services and public<lb/> transport, or of using the former to replace the latter. This is precisely why there are so many pilots – they<lb/> serve as learning exercises both in the organisational aspects of such programmes but also on their<lb/> impacts. Monitoring outcomes is key at this early stage. However, the metrics used to monitor outcomes<lb/> should not be limited to those traditionally used by public transport operators in reference to traditional<lb/> service models. These types of metrics may include on-time performance, average headways, and other<lb/> operational aspects of public transport production. These are important but they do not capture how the<lb/> public views the services being offered. Other metrics relating to wait times (average and distribution),<lb/> frequency, the &quot; feel &quot; of the trip experience (e.g. Los Angeles is tracking transport &quot; happiness &quot; ), overall<lb/> convenience, etc., may be as, or more relevant. These are important metrics that allow agencies and<lb/> authorities to understand how well users view the mobility offer on hand and whether or not it is compelling<lb/> enough to effectively compete with car transport.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another aspect to keep in mind is that even the &quot; production &quot; indices related to ride services are likely to be<lb/> quite different from those used for public transport. This, in conjunction with the great amount of data<lb/></p>

			<head>46</head>

			<table>– FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/></table>

			<p>produced by app-based ride service platforms, has led to calls for ride services – especially (but not only)<lb/> those engaged in pilots with public transport services – to provide a large amount of data. This typically has<lb/> occurred in an uncoordinated manner across different cities and countries but there are increasing calls for<lb/> some form of standardised data-sharing from ride service companies to cities. Certain cities, like New York<lb/> and London, have compelled ride services to share data in return for operational licensing, while yet others<lb/> have been unsuccessful with the same companies – possibly because of a poorly structured or overly broad<lb/> data requests. ITF (2016b) notes how public interest data sharing must balance private security,<lb/> commercial secrets, valid public insight into the impact of operations and technical capacity on the part of<lb/> public agencies. It also points out how data sharing – as currently construed – is not the only way, nor even<lb/> necessarily the best way, to extract useable and trustable insight from ride service data. Nonetheless, the<lb/> calls for data sharing continue, prompting at least two interesting responses.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the first instance, Uber has offered to share anonymised trip data with cities through its</p>

			<table>Movement data<lb/> platform announced in January 2017. This platform provides city officials and regulators with data on trips<lb/> in areas where sufficient density allows adequate anonymisation. Information on individual trips is not<lb/> provided. Movement will give insight into traffic flow speeds and locations where trip density is elevated. It<lb/> will also provide insights into the manner in which events and other disruptions impact street traffic.<lb/> Table 2. NACTO-suggested ride service data sharing elements<lb/> 1.

These principles cover a much broader set of data than released by Uber through<lb/> its Movement platform and, for instance, while it may be analogous to some of the data that taxis may<lb/> have to provide in New York City, it represents a broad expansion of data requests in relation to ride<lb/></table>

			<p>services. This, NACTO states, is necessary in order to enable cities to better carry out data-driven planning<lb/> and policy decisions, and to help them redesign streets to meet modern needs. Ride services view this<lb/> expansive data request as over-reaching what might constitute reasonable data sharing on their part.<lb/> Especially as concerns the potential for the release of privacy-eroding or commercially sensitive data.<lb/> Furthermore, it isn&apos;t clear if all ride service providers even collect some of the data elements specified in the<lb/> NACTO list, especially as concerns accelerometer data. Very likely that data in particular, will be<lb/> increasingly generated and stored by vehicles themselves and data discovery will involve automobile<lb/> manufacturers rather than ride service companies.<lb/> Irrespective of the specification for data elements to be shared by ride service companies, there is the issue<lb/> of fairness in data discovery requirements. The vast majority of traffic entails privately owned vehicles and<lb/> there are no requirements on these to provide the type of data outlined in the NACTO guidelines. That is<lb/> partly because there is no defined regulatory mandate to do so. People acquire a right to drive based on<lb/> passing a minimum skills test and are not restricted in where they may drive except as determined by the<lb/> rules governing road use. This may change as higher levels of automation come about and there is a need<lb/> to understand how algorithms operate in traffic – especially as concerns safety outcomes. Public transport<lb/> and taxi services do operate in a licensed environment and it makes sense that, in return for operations,<lb/> they too provide the same type of data as being sought from ride services in many cities. This may be an<lb/> area where further cross-modal harmonisation is required in gathering data for public or commercial<lb/> services operated on public roads.<lb/></p>

			<table>– ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> 5. Ensuring equitable access for an ageing population<lb/> One of the recurrent questions in discussions regarding the convergence of innovative mobility services and<lb/> public transport relates to the broader equity impacts of this convergence as they relate to equitable<lb/> access. Equity issues extend to many potential groups, including low-income groups, minorities, part-time<lb/> workers, people with physical and cognitive impairments and the elderly. The Institute for Transport and<lb/> Development Policy has issued useful guidance in addressing how innovative mobility services can also<lb/> provide opportunities for low-income households (Kodransky and Lewenstein<ref type="biblio">, 2014</ref>). This chapter focuses<lb/> on what it would take to make innovative mobility services accessible and acceptable to, and useable by,<lb/> older people and people with physical, sensory or cognitive impairments.<lb/></p>

			<p>This is an important question and one that will become even more relevant over time. This is due to a close<lb/> correlation between age and disability; as populations age, disability becomes more prevalent. Virtually<lb/> every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number of older people in their population.<lb/></p>

			<p>Between 2015 and 2030, the number of people in the world aged 60 years or over is projected to grow by<lb/> 56% from 901 million to 1.4 billion, and by 2050, the global population of older people is projected to more<lb/> than double its size in 2015, reaching nearly 2.1 billion.<lb/> Global ageing has a major influence on disability trends. The relationship is straightforward: there is higher<lb/> risk of disability at older ages. Informal estimates suggest that some two-thirds of people with disabilities<lb/> are over retirement age and that one-third of older people have some kind of disability. The prevalence and<lb/> severity of disability increases with older old age (currently 80 years plus).<lb/> Data on disability reveals that across the age spectrum mobility impairments are the most common<lb/> problem, with difficulty lifting and carrying, poor manual dexterity and problems with communication and<lb/> memory loss also significant factors. Many older people are affected by a range of impairments including<lb/> some loss of visual acuity, some loss of hearing, short term memory loss and difficulty gripping, climbing<lb/></p>

			<p>(steps) and balancing. There is also a clear link between a loss of mobility and a decline in physical and<lb/> mental health and wellbeing. An OECD report noted that &quot; even though disability prevalence rates have<lb/> declined to some extent in recent years in some countries, the ageing of the population and the greater<lb/> longevity of individuals can be expected to lead to increasing numbers of people at older ages with a severe<lb/> disability &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Lafortune and Balestat, 2007</ref>).<lb/> In terms of providing adequately equipped vehicles, it is important to note that only a small proportion of<lb/> people with disabilities are wheelchair users. In addition to those with mobility or sensory impairments,<lb/> many have &quot; hidden &quot; conditions including cognitive and mental health issues. Dementia in all its many forms<lb/> affects a growing number of people. UK figures indicate that dementia and related neurological conditions<lb/> affect around 10% of people aged over 65 and around 50% of those aged over 80.<lb/></p>

			<head>Enabling older people and people with disabilities to travel<lb/></head>

			<p>There are a number of key factors to be considered before designing or committing to any transport service<lb/> or system:<lb/></p>

			<table><lb/> Low levels of Internet and smartphone access and usage among older people and those with low<lb/> income (which includes many people with disabilities) (see section below).<lb/> <lb/> Discomfort/lack of confidence with using on-line systems even if people have access.<lb/> <lb/> Strong preference for human contact as means of booking trip/seeking advice during trip. In this<lb/> context services provided in future by driverless vehicles could present particular challenges to the<lb/> confidence of older people.<lb/> <lb/> Reluctance to use automated answering systems/push button options for correct department, etc.,<lb/> which many older and disabled people lack confidence to understand or physical ability to use.<lb/> <lb/> Concerns about giving out personal/bank information/data.<lb/> <lb/> Concerns for personal safety (exacerbated by being alone in a vehicle with an unknown driver).<lb/> <lb/> Need for social interaction that comes with mainstream bus/train travel.<lb/> <lb/> Physical accessibility of vehicles (more difficult in smaller vehicles). Features need to include:<lb/> wheelchair access (not necessarily all vehicles but see next point), low level entry, grab handles,<lb/> swivel seats, colour contrast, arm rests.<lb/> <lb/> Availability of vehicles for spontaneous travel: Many cities in Europe and North America now have<lb/></table>

			<p>mainstream public transport that is accessible to many people with disabilities, including wheelchair<lb/> users. If that is replaced by on-demand mobility services, the same level of accessibility/availability<lb/> will be needed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another key consideration relating to the delivery of app-based ride services is whether or not current and<lb/> successive older populations are capable of using these services – are they technologically savvy? This is an<lb/> important consideration since increasingly, internet and/or smartphone access is needed to organise<lb/> spontaneous travel and to get the best price deals on trips. For many older people this represents a major<lb/> barrier:<lb/></p>

			<table><lb/> 44% of Americans aged 65 and above are not on-line.<lb/> <lb/> Only 27% of Americans aged over 65 have a smartphone (compared with 85% of those aged<lb/> 18-29. Although this might suggest that the next generation of older people will be more<lb/> comfortable with technology, note the final bullet in this section.<lb/> Some of the difficulties for older people using technology include:<lb/> <lb/> poor manual dexterity affecting ability to use keyboard and touch screen<lb/> <lb/> vision problems affecting ability to read screens and keyboards<lb/> <lb/> confusion and short-term memory loss making on-line transactions difficult and stressful<lb/> <lb/> concern about data security and reluctance to disclose personal information.<lb/></table>

			<p>These difficulties are likely to persist even as currently technologically savvy generations age. It is likely<lb/> that as each generation reaches old age, it will face similar difficulties as the pace of technology moves<lb/> faster than people&apos;s ability to stay ahead of it mentally and physically. Given the likely increase in<lb/> prevalence of digital interfaces – especially in the context of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) – designing<lb/> services that are accessible for as wide a population as possible will become a core concern. This is already<lb/> the case for Finland, a pioneer in MaaS policy and deployment (see Box 5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Current accessibility trends in transport<lb/></head>

			<p>Against the background of the discussion on mobility services, it is important to understand both the<lb/> historical context and the current situation on</p>

			<table>transport accessibility. Over the past 30 years, in North<lb/> America, Europe and elsewhere there have been developments, initiated by the civil rights movement and<lb/> increasingly enshrined in law, to require all public transport to be designed and operated by vehicles and<lb/> systems accessible to people who use wheelchairs, have walking difficulty, impaired sight or hearing, etc. In<lb/> many towns and cities 100% of public transport is now accessible. These developments have opened up<lb/> 50 – ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/> opportunities for people with disabilities to live independent lives, to enjoy spontaneous travel and to access<lb/> employment, education and social activities freely.<lb/> Box 5. Mobility as a Service and accessibility: Experience and guidance from Finland<lb/></table>

			<p>Finland is an early leader in terms of integrating the concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) into regulatory<lb/> frameworks, data structures and systems, operational rules and commercial deployment. Government policy aims<lb/> to ensure that the deployment of these services does not exclude people requiring assistance to travel or those<lb/> with various physical and cognitive disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Finland more than 19% of the population is considered disabled and 1.2 million people are over 65 years old.<lb/> Any system inaccessible to these people prevents their contribution and equitable participation in society.<lb/> Digitalisation of information acquisition about, and the purchase of, transport services has led to great efficiencies<lb/> but simultaneously, has eroded the ability for the non-digitally savvy or those who cannot use non-accessible<lb/> digital interfaces to travel easily. This trend in digitalisation has been accompanied by a reduction of personal<lb/> customer service in vehicles, terminals, service centres and call centres. This increases the risk of marginalisation<lb/> for those that those who cannot use mobile devices due to age, disability, language skills, or other reasons.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a strong push in Finland to ensure that MaaS deployment also includes accessibility considerations. This<lb/> takes several forms at present:<lb/></p>

			<figure><lb/> There is a need for structured and standardised data to be communicated across the range of MaaS<lb/> actors regarding travel route accessibility and vehicular accessibility and capacity. This data should be an<lb/> integral part of the data package provided by transport operators to MaaS operators and eventually to<lb/> customers. This data is required by law to be available in machine readable format through open<lb/> interfaces by 1 January 2018. These essential accessibility data elements via open interfaces are required<lb/> by the Finnish Transport Code (TC) coming into force in 2018 and covers all transport modes and<lb/> services. However each transport mode have their mode specific data attributes, so additional work is<lb/> underway to define &quot; agreed minimums &quot; for the most critical data.<lb/> <lb/> Data regarding passengers special needs should be delivered in standardised form from MaaS operators<lb/> to the producers of transport services. The MyData model (https://mydatafi.wordpress.com/) that<lb/> emphasises the users right to limit or share the use of their personal data, could allow even more detailed<lb/> health and personal data to be communicated via application programming interfaces. Model interfaces<lb/> are being developed under a implementation project for the Finnish TC.<lb/></figure>

			<p><lb/> Accessibility should be designed into user interfaces from the outset using existing and accepted<lb/> standards.<lb/> <lb/> Additional services, e.g. call centre and alternative sales channels, will be needed for those who cannot<lb/> use digital user interfaces. Responsibilities in organising these additional services will need to be allocated<lb/> between public and commercial actors according to common rules. The new Finnish TC gives public<lb/> entities more flexibility to purchase or cover additional expenses to organise rural area or night duty<lb/> coverage for people with special needs.<lb/> Source: Adapted from Somerpalo et al. (2017).<lb/> Door-to-door or paratransit services, common in North America and many parts of Europe, which were the<lb/> starting point for accessibility for older and disabled people, are increasingly seen as a complement to<lb/> rather than a substitute for accessible public transport. In some cities (for example Barcelona and London),<lb/> the transport operator encourages people to use public transport rather than &quot; special &quot; services by providing<lb/> a mentor or companion to travel with them until they are comfortable with the route and the process.<lb/></p>

			<p>For those older people who have never been public transport users, the prospect of giving up driving is<lb/> often very frightening and as a consequence, many stay behind the wheel longer than they should. Many<lb/> are deterred by the complexity of accessing and understanding bus or rail timetables or purchasing tickets.<lb/> At the same time, they may feel intimidated by ride services that combine technological elements that they<lb/> may poorly master and the need to provide banking details in advance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Suggested prerequisites for inclusive mobility services<lb/></head>

			<p>Taking on board the points set out above, if mobility services complement or replace accessible mainstream<lb/> public transport, they would need to provide at least the same degree of spontaneity and flexibility to travel<lb/> when the individual wants or needs. In cities where frequent accessible buses and on-street hail taxis are<lb/> available, this would mean ensuring that ride services licensed by public authorities provide services as<lb/> accessible as those they complement or replace and that drivers are sufficiently trained. This may mean a<lb/> substantial number of vehicles deployed would meet international accessibility standards. On-going<lb/> monitoring of these outcomes is necessary.<lb/> However, in places without this tradition of high levels of accessibility, or where on-street hailing is less<lb/> frequent and bus service headways poorer, a proportion of accessible vehicles could probably meet<lb/> demand, although defining the optimum number would depend on the efficiency of booking and vehicle<lb/> location systems. This seems to be the case for many of the US-based pilot programmes. As part of this<lb/> provision, real-time mapping system would need to be able to locate and book the nearest accessible<lb/> vehicle. In all circumstances and situations, an adequate pool of accessible vehicles would need to be<lb/> available at all times so that people with disabilities did not have to wait (much) longer than other people to<lb/> make their trip. There is some experimentation underway (e.g. Uber in New York City) on mixing<lb/> short-term leases for accessible vehicles, a flat incentive payment for drivers undertaking those trips and<lb/> reduced commissions by the ride service platform. In contexts where accessibility requirements impose that<lb/> all public transport vehicles are accessible and public transport frequencies are high, a move to longer wait<lb/> times for accessible ride service vehicles will represent a retrograde step.<lb/></p>

			<p>Drivers providing accessible services would need to have specialist training in understanding and meeting<lb/> the needs of older people and people with disabilities. This would include both disability awareness training<lb/> and job specific practical training in areas such as guiding a blind person, assisting a wheelchair user,<lb/> understanding and supporting a person with dementia.<lb/> Furthermore, a system would need to be set up that incentivised companies/drivers to purchase more<lb/> expensive accessible vehicles and that compensated them for making fewer trips because of the time taken<lb/> to assist a passenger with a disability. These are the principles that guided the development of MBTA&apos;s RIDE<lb/> pilot.<lb/> Close monitoring and a contractual framework would need to be in place to ensure that drivers/companies<lb/> were not avoiding the calls from people with disabilities (there is some evidence of this from the<lb/> introduction of accessible taxis is the UK and elsewhere).<lb/></p>

			<p>For younger people with physical or sensory disabilities (at least in the developed world), internet access<lb/> and smartphone use is generally not a problem with new technology compensating for lack of manual<lb/> dexterity or vision, etc. Provided that vehicles were suitable and drivers were trained, they would mostly<lb/> adapt without difficulty. For those with learning disabilities or mental health issues, the challenges would<lb/> include understanding how to use the system and being able to trust the driver (police checks as well as<lb/> training would be necessary for all drivers dealing with vulnerable passengers). Non hi-tech systems such<lb/> as those suggested below for older people might also be helpful to those with learning disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For older people without access to the internet or without the skills to make bookings and other<lb/> transactions, alternatives could include:<lb/> <lb/> a phone line, staffed by people (Lyft has put in place this service in some of its paratransit pilots in<lb/> the United States)<lb/> <lb/> access points in local shops and cafés where people would be available to help with the transaction<lb/> 52 – ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/></figure>

			<p><lb/> a simple means of data protection that would give older people the confidence that their personal<lb/> finances were not being compromised<lb/> <lb/> enabling people to travel with a companion at no charge or reduced charge to give people the<lb/> confidence to make the journey (particularly important for those with dementia and a common<lb/> policy among mainstream local transport providers).<lb/></p>

			<head>Can mobility services meet everyone&apos;s needs?<lb/></head>

			<p>The section above sets out some of the basic parameters for accessibility, acceptability and usability by<lb/> older people and people with disabilities. Some other issues also need to be addressed, such as consistency<lb/> of service, equality and social issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>For many older people, particularly those living alone, using public transport may be the only opportunity<lb/> for social interaction and is an important part of retaining their ability to live and to function independently.<lb/> Social interaction is a major factor in preventing both physical and mental decline (which represent a huge<lb/> economic cost to society, as well as social and personal cost to the individual). Travelling as the only<lb/> passenger is a vehicle will not provide the same stimulation and may cause anxiety, which leads to a<lb/> preference for inclusive services, covering all users including those with access needs. Also, the ability to<lb/> travel with a companion (at no extra costs) would help with this concern both for older people and for those<lb/> with mental health issues or learning disabilities.<lb/> One of the key achievements of the past 30 years (in Europe and North America among others) has been to<lb/> achieve harmonised and consistent rules on what accessible vehicles should look like so that people with<lb/> disabilities can travel with confidence knowing that they will be able to complete all stages of their journey.<lb/> It will be important for the criteria for vehicle accessibility to be clearly defined and non-negotiable<lb/> otherwise there is a risk of sending an &quot; accessible &quot; vehicle that cannot accommodate, for example,<lb/> someone travelling in a large wheelchair or with a mobility scooter.<lb/></p>

			<p>To avoid a major backlash from the disability community that 30 years of campaigning for civil rights has<lb/> been thrown away, it is vital that mobility services are promoted and introduced as a new way of travel for<lb/> the population as a whole and one that is as universally accessible as public transport has increasingly<lb/> become. There is otherwise a risk that it will look as if there is a regression back to the days of separate<lb/> specialised transport.<lb/></p>

			<head>What about the future? Testing equitable accessibility of shared mobility<lb/> services<lb/></head>

			<p>Going forward, it seems clear that urban mobility markets will undergo significant changes as ride services<lb/> and other, innovative, mobility services are developed in conjunction with, or as competition to, existing<lb/> transport options including personal car use, taxis and public transport. At the same time, as mentioned in<lb/> the opening of this report, there is considerable uncertainty regarding which business model (or models)<lb/> will prevail and what role public authorities will play in facilitating, guiding or blocking new initiatives from<lb/> the private sector. This uncertainty extends to the ability for new business models to address the mobility<lb/> and accessibility needs of the entire population. In order to help reduce some of this uncertainty, ITF has<lb/> investigated the extent to which shared mobility systems as modelled in previous work (see ITF 2015;<lb/> 2016c) could handle the needs of a population requiring special assistance or accessible vehicles to travel.<lb/> It finds that under certain configurations, deploying a fleet of fully accessible vehicles is an attractive and<lb/> cost-effective solution (see Box 6). While the shared mobility services modelled in the work represent just<lb/> one potential mobility market in the future, the work suggests that pro-consumer innovation can, when<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION – 53<lb/> SHAPING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND INNOVATIVE MOBILITY – © OECD/ITF 2017<lb/></figure>

			<p>carefully and purposefully designed, also result in better outcomes for all urban travellers – including those<lb/> with physical or cognitive disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 6. Inclusive mobility services based on shared rides<lb/></head>

			<p>The ITF has undertaken extensive modelling of optimised shared-use mobility services in urban areas (see ITF,<lb/> 2015; 2016d) as a way of re-thinking the nature of urban public-transport-like services. This work has shown how<lb/> the flexibility and convenience of demand-responsive shared mobility solutions can lead to better mobility,<lb/> congestion, environmental and spatial accessibility outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>But what about the potential contribution of such systems to improved access for older people and those with<lb/> reduced mobility, including individuals with physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities or travellers carrying heavy<lb/> bags or accompanying young children? ITF proposes a framework to value the social and economic benefits of<lb/> improved access, including time savings, greater convenience, more employment opportunities and savings across<lb/> the social care and health sectors (ITF, 2016d).<lb/> A new ITF report (ITF, 2017) assumes that 10% of all trips in an urban simulation will be generated by people<lb/> requiring accessible vehicles, and that these trips are carried out only by on-demand, door-to-door, Shared Taxi<lb/> services. Other trips are handled by demand-responsive mini-bus services, high-capacity public transport, walking<lb/> as well as by Shared Taxis. Accessible service trips are carried out by vehicles fitted with a ramp (or a lift), a wider<lb/> door (on the side or on the back) and a safe place to anchor a wheelchair along the lines required by the US ADA<lb/> (Americans with Disabilities Act)(United States Access Board, 1991) or other applicable national standards. Not all<lb/> &quot; accessible &quot; trips require wheelchair access vehicles but for the purposes of the exercise, the ITF only modelled<lb/> one accessible vehicle class.<lb/></p>

			<p>Wheelchair accessible vehicles have a higher capital cost (the report assumes 40% more) and have higher fuel<lb/> costs (10% more in the simulation) due to the higher weight. In addition, the longer boarding and alighting times<lb/> for people with special mobility needs can imply somewhat lower service productivity. For these two reasons,<lb/> delivering a disability-accessible service costs a bit more in the modelling exercise than a service that has no<lb/> accessible vehicles.<lb/></p>

			<p>In cities that provide on-call paratransit services travellers requiring accessible vehicles often have 24-hour<lb/> advance reservation requirements. In this case, the model specification was set such that people requiring<lb/> accessible vehicles would face the same (rather low) maximum acceptable waiting times for all other travellers.<lb/> The most optimal approach to ensure this was to model a Shared Taxi fleet that was 100% accessible – as is the<lb/> case in certain cities around the world.<lb/> Taking all of these considerations into account, the report finds that, when modelling a scenario considering that<lb/> 10% of the travelling population has special mobility needs and including 100% accessible Shared Taxis, the<lb/> breakeven price per passenger.kilometre (including overheads and profits) was only a bit higher than in the<lb/> scenario with no accessible Shared Taxis, and still at 60% of the current equivalent price for public transport.<lb/> International evidence also points to the potential of accessible transport systems to generate large economic<lb/> benefits (ITF, 2016d).<lb/></p>

			<p>The main reasons for the quite small increment in the price per passenger.kilometre in spite of the 40% higher<lb/> capital costs and 10% fuel costs of the adapted vehicles, are the large distances run each day by these shared<lb/> vehicles and the relatively large part of the costs corresponding to labour.<lb/></p>

			<p>These results confirm the high value of shared solutions also for this particular segment of the urban mobility<lb/> market, and thus a promising option offering high levels of personal accessibility in an inclusive and very efficient<lb/> scheme.</p>
