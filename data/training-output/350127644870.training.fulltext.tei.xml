			<figure>THE IMPACT OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT ON AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT<lb/> CAPACITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES<lb/> Air quality data: the first step toward cleaner skies in the developing world<lb/></figure>

			<p>Air quality in many developing countries, particularly urban centres, has become severely polluted<lb/> over the last several decades as a consequence of industrial development, economic growth and large-scale<lb/> migrations by rural residents to cities. Air pollution degrades the health and quality of life for people. Air<lb/> pollution also exacts direct costs on national economies in the forms of reduced productivity and greater<lb/> demand for medical services. In addition, there are indirect costs that are rarely accounted for such as the<lb/> decreased value of the natural resource &apos;asset&apos; of clean air in a nation, decreased tourism and even reduced<lb/> foreign investment as a result of polluted air or other environmental and health impacts of polluted air.<lb/> Citizens in the United States, Japan and much of Europe enjoy relatively clean air thanks to<lb/> enforcement of air quality laws and market-based incentives for emitters to reduce their output of sulphur<lb/> dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants. But efforts to reduce<lb/> pollution lag significantly in most developing countries largely because the costs of obtaining cleaner air<lb/> — through such measures as replacing and upgrading vehicles and installing air pollution control devices<lb/> on industrial facilities and power plants — represent a large investment relative to national economic<lb/> output.<lb/> Nonetheless, there is a strong interest in improving air quality among citizens and leaders of<lb/> developing countries with heavily polluted airsheds. Reflecting the desire for cleaner air, many developing<lb/> countries have enacted clean-air laws similar to those of developed nations, although to date most of these<lb/> laws have been poorly enforced. Regional initiatives such as the Air Pollution in the Megacities of Asia<lb/> (APMA) and Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities are aiding national governments and developing<lb/> transnational strategies for cleaner air; and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian<lb/> Development Bank are funding air-quality management programs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The challenges to improving air quality in developing countries range from a lack of government<lb/> commitment to even weak policies and standards to lack of accurate air-quality data, according to APMA&apos;s<lb/> Strategic Framework for Air Quality Management in Asia (2004). All these obstacles must be overcome to<lb/> improve air quality in developing countries, but a key starting point is obtaining comprehensive and<lb/> reliable air-quality monitoring data. Such data are scarce in developing countries, and where they exist,<lb/> they are often incomplete or inaccurate. Without effective and useful data, it is impossible to identify and<lb/> apportion the sources of emissions, and to establish permanent monitoring systems and hence impossible to<lb/> develop effective measures to prevent and reduce harmful pollutants.<lb/> In the Philippines, for example, acquiring accurate and reliable data on the sources and levels of air<lb/> pollution is viewed as a crucial first step in implementing national clean-air policies. While the government<lb/> has the legal authority to regulate emissions through fees or taxes on major emitters, according to Air<lb/> Pollution Control Policy Options (2003), a report by Resources for the Future, it must first develop the<lb/> capacity to compile specific emissions data and validate data from emitters. The agency must also<lb/> determine the &quot; precise extent and distribution of stationary source and other emissions in Metro Manila, &quot;<lb/> according to the report.<lb/></p>

			<head>Five case studies: NGOs, Governments and businesses collaborate to build air quality monitoring<lb/> capacity<lb/></head>

			<p>A range of air quality monitoring projects has been implemented over the last decade in developing<lb/> countries. This report explores the impacts of such projects, focusing on case studies from five countries:<lb/> Morocco, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Malaysia. These projects were selected and profiled in late<lb/> 2005.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all the case studies except for the Indian fuel testing project, imported air-quality monitoring<lb/> equipment was crucial to the programmes&apos; successes. Such equipment is not manufactured to any<lb/> significant degree in developing countries at this point. (In the Indian case, advanced imported equipment<lb/> for fuel testing would have increased the speed and efficiency of testing, but project funding limits forced<lb/> the investigators to use older, indigenously manufactured equipment.)<lb/></p>

			<p>With the vast majority of their sales in the developed countries, manufacturers still do not see much of<lb/> a market in the developing world and have little incentive to license their technology to producers in<lb/> developing nations. While manufacturers&apos; instruments and monitoring systems source sub-components<lb/> worldwide, virtually all technologically advanced components are sourced from developed countries, and<lb/> virtually all assembly and testing is performed in the manufacturers&apos; domestic factories. This could change<lb/> in the future if the volume of purchases in developing countries increased to the point where manufacturers<lb/> could achieve the economies of scale necessary to outsource or franchise production to manufacturers in<lb/> developing countries.<lb/> Overall it seems to be clear that most analytical technology used in the developing world for<lb/> environmental purposes is imported from developed nations. However, like much of the broader<lb/> environmental industry that involves air, waste, wastewater, solid waste, recycling and remediation, there<lb/> are significant service and labour components involved in almost every environmental project. So often,<lb/> the importation of a piece of sophisticated machinery involves the employment and training of a large<lb/> number of individuals and contributes to the building of institutions. An example exists in the Manila<lb/> project where a USD2.3-million project funded by the Asian Development Bank involves the purchase of<lb/> just USD170 000 worth of monitoring equipment, with most of the remaining amount used for data<lb/> collection and analysis by local project team members.<lb/> important step in capacity building to address the very serious problem of air pollution in the developing<lb/> world.<lb/></p>

			<head>ANNEX 1. CASE STUDIES OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAMMES IN<lb/> DEVELOPING COUNTRIES<lb/> Jorf Lasfar Energy Company<lb/> Air Quality Monitoring Project<lb/> El Jadida, Morocco<lb/></head>

			<p>To stimulate economic development and reduce poverty through the provision of reliable electricity,<lb/> the Moroccan government embarked in the early 1990s on a project to build a large coal-fired electrical<lb/> generation station near the port of Jorf Lasfar in El Jadida, 130 km west of Casablanca.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Two 330-MW units were constructed by the national electric utility, Office National de l&apos;Electricité<lb/> (ONE), and placed in service in 1994 and 1995. During this period, the national legal framework was<lb/> modified to allow independent power production, and in 1994, ONE requested bids for the construction of<lb/> two additional units. Because the electricity law required that power assets be owned by ONE, the agency<lb/> sought a builder-operator team to construct the two new units and operate all four units with a 30-year<lb/> power purchase agreement.<lb/> ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd (Zurich) and CMS Morocco Operating Co., a wholly owned subsidiary<lb/> of CMS Energy Corporation (Dearborn, Michigan, USA) were the chosen bidders to build and operate the<lb/> power plant. These entities formed the jointly owned Jorf Lasfar Energy Company and entered into a long-<lb/>term agreement, which was a 30-year lease by the project company of the four units.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In addition to cash flows from the existing units and investor equity, the project was financed with<lb/> loans from Swiss, Italian and U.S. export credit agencies and commercial loans backed by World Bank<lb/> guarantees. The USD 1.483 billion project included port enhancements to facilitate the increase in coal<lb/> shipments, as well as upgraded transmission lines from the power plant.<lb/></p>

			<p>To meet World Bank standards for NO X , SO 2 and particulate air emissions, the power plant<lb/> incorporated electrostatic precipitators and other measures. In accordance with loan conditions, the project<lb/> also included an ambient air-quality monitoring system to evaluate the effect of the power plant on the<lb/> local environment.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two meteorological stations and one air-monitoring station were established to measure SO 2 , NO X ,<lb/> total suspended particulates (TSP), and respirable particulates (PM 10 ). The initial contract for monitoring<lb/> equipment and related services was approximately USD 250 000. The monitoring stations are operated by<lb/> JLEC, but to ensure the data quality and the sustainability of the monitoring effort, URS Corporation (San<lb/> Francisco) is under contract to perform annual audits of the monitoring network. Additional auditing,<lb/> preventative maintenance and training are provided by URS, as needed.<lb/></p>

			<p>The system has been in operation for almost 10 years and has a very good reliability record (valid data<lb/> capture rates are consistently above 90%). The monitoring system has documented that the plant does not<lb/> emit pollutants in excess of levels that would exceed World Bank or WHO guidelines for air quality. Of<lb/> particular importance, monitoring data have shown that occasional elevated levels of SO 2 in the area are<lb/> caused by other industrial sources and not the JLEC power plant. Similarly, the occasional days with high<lb/> dust levels have been shown to be due to natural windblown dust (the plant is on the edge of the desert)<lb/> and not the power plant.<lb/> The Jorf Lasfar power plant has brought enormous advantages to the country&apos;s people. It provides<lb/> approximately 65% of Morocco&apos;s baseload electricity demand and one-third of the country&apos;s total<lb/> electricity supply. And with this monitoring system, the government and plant operators are confident that<lb/> the electricity is generated without significant adverse impacts on the environment.<lb/> Additionally, the project provides an example of the type of data that is needed to improve air quality<lb/> in polluted airsheds throughout the country. In a recent report by the World Bank, (<ref type="biblio">Sarraf and Jorio, 2003</ref>),<lb/> improved air quality monitoring was cited as a top priority. &quot; Despite progress to date, much still needs to<lb/> be done in the area of air quality monitoring. Studies should be conducted not only to measure the<lb/> concentration of air pollutants and track the effectiveness of pollution control mechanisms, but also to<lb/> show the relationship between pollution and the environment, health, quality of life and natural resources, &quot;<lb/> states the report. The JLEC air quality monitoring system provides an excellent example for other<lb/> industrial and power generating plants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Metro Manila Air Quality Monitoring Project<lb/> Manila, Philippines<lb/></head>

			<p>Pollution from vehicles and industries render the air in Metropolitan Manila increasingly dangerous<lb/> for the region&apos;s approximately 20 million residents. When pediatricians were asked in the late 1990s to<lb/> identify the most common illnesses they treated, respiratory diseases were cited by 100% of the<lb/> respondents. While affluent families keep their children indoors, breathing filtered air, poor children,<lb/> especially those who beg in areas with heavy traffic, suffer chronic exposure to the heavily polluted air.<lb/> Adults suffer as well, with citizens complaining that the air on major thoroughfares leaves them dizzy and<lb/> hyperventilating. Studies by European and British health experts have demonstrated a strong link between<lb/> the region&apos;s polluted air and abnormally high rates of heart disease.<lb/></p>

			<p>As the metropolitan population continues to grow, so does the rate of pollution emissions, taking an<lb/> increasing toll on human health. If air-quality controls are not forthcoming, it is likely that the harmful<lb/> effects of polluted air will undermine advances in economic and social development.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cleaner air is a policy goal widely supported by citizens and leaders in the country. Indeed, the<lb/> Philippines passed an air-quality law similar to the U.S. Clean Air Act in 1999. Yet relatively little has<lb/> been done to implement the law. As in other developing nations, economic growth is the dominant priority,<lb/> and the nation lacks the resources to subsidise the costs of replacing and upgrading vehicles and installing<lb/> pollution controls on industrial emitters.<lb/> Acquiring good data on the sources and levels of air pollution is viewed as the key first step in<lb/> implementing the nation&apos;s clean-air policies. While the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural<lb/> Resources (DENR) has the legal authority to regulate emissions through fees or taxes on major emitters,<lb/> the agency must first develop greater capacity to compile specific emissions data, validate data from<lb/> emitters, collect fees, enforce penalties, and manage the resulting revenues, according to Air Pollution<lb/> Control Policy Options (<ref type="biblio">Krupnick et al., 2003</ref>), a report by Resources for the Future. The agency must also<lb/> determine the &quot; precise extent and distribution of stationary source and other emissions in Metro Manila, &quot;<lb/> according to the report. Of particular concern is the extent to which sulfur and SO 2 emissions must be<lb/> reduced. Existing data are old and came from just one source. &quot; Better data are critical to designing the fee<lb/> and evaluating the program, &quot; states the report.<lb/> To develop more comprehensive and reliable data on pollution levels and sources, DENR has created<lb/> the Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program. With funding from the Asian<lb/> Development Bank, a major emission sampling programme was initiated in 2004. DENR contracted with<lb/> TRC Environmental Corporation (Irvine, California) for a three-year,</p>

			<figure>USD 2.3 million Outsource<lb/> Sampling Program. TRC in turn contracted with a Filipino firm, Technical Experts on Environmental<lb/> Management (TEEM), to provide the manpower for data collection. The Outsource Sampling Program<lb/> involves four teams that are deploying mobile testing sets to measure stack emissions from about 1 000<lb/> sources in metropolitan Manila.<lb/> As of November 2005, 60% of the 500 emitters tested failed one or more criteria of the Philippine<lb/> clean air law. While no enforcement action has been taken to date, the initial results indicate that there is a<lb/> high rate of non-compliance. It is anticipated that the full data set and accompanying analysis will enable<lb/> the DENR to adapt appropriate enforcement protocols.<lb/></figure>

			<p>At the conclusion of the project, the equipment — approximately USD 160 000 worth of U.S.-made<lb/> gear for measuring PM, SO 2 , NO X , CO and some metals, as well as laboratory analysis equipment — will<lb/> be turned over to the agency. Since the contract includes a training component, it is anticipated that the<lb/> DENR will develop the capacity to operate the equipment in an expanded monitoring programme after<lb/> conclusion of the contract period.<lb/></p>

			<head>Imports of goods associated with the project<lb/></head>

			<p>Because the project was government-funded, tariffs were waived, but clearing customs was still<lb/> extraordinarily difficult, requiring specialised consultants and approximately 40 person-hours of staff time.<lb/> With six major shipments to date, approximately 240 hours have been expended on this activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Malaysia Air Quality Monitoring Network<lb/></head>

			<p>In the early 1990s, the Malaysian government issued an unusual request for a contractor to build a<lb/> nationwide air-quality monitoring system and provide its own financing. The government sought bidders<lb/> who would finance the project&apos;s construction and operating costs in exchange for a long-term contract to<lb/> sell air quality data to the government and the rights to sell data to third-party entities such as media<lb/> outlets. The high risks involved in such an arrangement dissuaded many would-be contractors and<lb/> equipment suppliers from the United States and other developed countries, but ultimately a joint venture<lb/> between Bovar (a Canadian company that merged with Orbus Life Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, in<lb/> 2002) and PIC Corp., a Malaysian company, met the government&apos;s terms.<lb/> Initiated in 1995, the network has become one of the most successful air-quality monitoring<lb/> programmes in the developing world. The USD 6 million system includes 51 continuous monitoring<lb/> stations, 44 to measure CO, SO 2 , NO X , PM 10 and ozone (O 3 ), and seven to measure PM 10 only; in addition,<lb/> there are 25 manual stations for TSP, PM 10 and heavy metals which are checked every six days. The<lb/> continuous monitors provide real-time updates every hour. The average data capture rate has been more<lb/> than 95%, and the project passed an audit by the US EPA.<lb/></p>

			<p>The 20-year contract between the joint venture, Alam Sekitar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (ASMA), and the<lb/> Malaysia Dept. of Environment included performance targets and penalties for nonperformance. Air<lb/> quality data sales have yielded enough revenue (approximately USD 4.8 million in 2002) to sustain the<lb/> company and finance its expansion. The company also maintains and earns revenues from a database of<lb/> water-quality data, but revenue figures are not available for that data. The ASMA staff of approximately<lb/> 100 is predominantly Malay; staffing by expatriate professionals has never exceeded five.<lb/></p>

			<head>Jakarta Health Risk Monitoring Project:<lb/> Exposure to Particulate Matter and Carbon Monoxide<lb/> Jakarta, Indonesia<lb/></head>

			<p>As in other Asian megacities, residents of Jakarta, Indonesia, suffer from extremely degraded air. Air<lb/> pollution is estimated to result in net costs of at least USD 400 million annually, exacting a very serious<lb/> health consequences in the form of respiratory diseases, which are the sixth leading cause of death in<lb/> Indonesia (after accidents, diarrhoea, cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis and measles). 2<lb/></p>

			<p>The Indonesian government ordered the phasing out of leaded gasoline in 2001, but implementation<lb/> has been repeatedly delayed, and nationwide phase-out of leaded gasoline is now expected to be<lb/> accomplished in 2006. Lead levels in one study of children were high enough to impair cognitive<lb/> development in one-third of those tested.<lb/> Air-quality monitoring in Jakarta has historically consisted of a dispersed system of five ambient air-<lb/>quality monitoring stations that collect data of little practical use in identifying sources. In order to<lb/> generate more reliable and useful data on air pollution sources and exposure levels, the Ministry of the<lb/> Environment, the University of Indonesia, and the University of California Berkeley have collaborated to<lb/> develop and implement a unique project that uses citizen volunteers to monitor other citizens&apos; exposure to<lb/> PM and CO. The project&apos;s USD 200 000 budget has been provided by the US-Asian Environmental<lb/> Partnership (USAID), the project partners, and the Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation<lb/> (Swisscontact).<lb/> State-of-the-art equipment for measuring PM and CO was borrowed and purchased from<lb/> manufacturers and air-quality laboratories in the United States. It included highly sensitive devices capable<lb/> of measuring particles from 0.1 microns to 2.5 microns. Placing the equipment in backpacks and shoulder<lb/> packs, student investigators from the University of Indonesia shadowed more than 50 individuals —<lb/> students of many ages, traffic officers, a variety of workers — for 8-hour and 24-hour periods. The<lb/> investigators recorded the time, environment and conditions precisely, including such factors as whether<lb/> the air conditioning on a bus was functioning and how long the subject spent on a particular street corner.<lb/> Pollution levels were monitored continuously, with 10-second resolution.<lb/></p>

			<p>Such a technically sophisticated measuring program is rare even in the developed world. Project<lb/> managers designed the programme to provide extraordinarily robust and precise data to provide Indonesian<lb/> air quality management policy makers with tools to craft and implement effective regulations in a cost-<lb/>efficient and timely manner. By screening particle sizes so precisely, the resulting data will identify the<lb/> types and locations of pollution sources with unusual specificity. Data analysis was still underway at the<lb/> time this report was being written.<lb/> The project was also geared to empower Indonesian staff and volunteers to gain the technical<lb/> expertise necessary to continue and expand such monitoring programmes. It has reportedly inspired<lb/> officials at the city and national environmental agencies with a vision of what can be accomplished in<lb/> terms of effective monitoring. However, additional resources and training will be required to assure that<lb/> future monitoring yields reliable data.<lb/></p>

			<head>Imports of goods associated with the project<lb/></head>

			<p>To avoid the delays and unusual fees associated with Indonesian customs, project equipment was<lb/> brought into the country as personal luggage by professional consultants travelling to the country.<lb/> Importing the equipment commercially would have caused delays of 8 to 12 weeks and added significant<lb/> costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fuel Testing for Air Quality Project<lb/> Tamil Nadu, India<lb/></head>

			<p>Air quality in Indian cities has deteriorated over the last decade due in large measure to the sharp<lb/> increase in the number and use of motor vehicles of all types. In addition to the increase in numbers of<lb/> vehicles and emissions, there is widespread evidence that the air-quality problems are compounded by<lb/> retail gasoline dealers who adulterate gasoline and diesel with less expensive hydrocarbon fuels. Gasoline<lb/> is typically adulterated with solvents such as hexane, benzene, toluene, naphtha and other hydrocarbon<lb/> mixtures having the boiling range within that of gasoline, while diesel is typically adulterated with<lb/> kerosene. Vehicles powered by adulterated fuel emit high levels of air pollutants, including PM, CO, NO X ,<lb/> SO 2 , and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The price differential between gasoline purchased<lb/> from oil companies and these materials presents an irresistible profit opportunity to many fuel dealers.<lb/> Even imported kerosene is less expensive than domestic diesel fuel.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Oil companies have begun testing fuel at retail outlets, but it is believed that fuel adulterated by as<lb/> much as 30% still tests clean because of the range of values in the testing methods of the Bureau of Indian<lb/> Standards (BIS), and also because the high-quality fuels provided by oil companies can accommodate<lb/> significant adulteration without violating BIS specifications.<lb/> In 1999, CONCERT (the Center for Consumer Education, Research Teaching, Training and Testing)<lb/> in Chennai (formerly Madras), Tamil Nadu, took samples from 21 retail fuel outlets in Chennai. Using a<lb/> gas chromatograph method developed by a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, CONCERT&apos;s<lb/> research showed a high level of adulteration of diesel and gasoline in all 21 samples.<lb/> To more rigorously test for fuel adulteration, CONCERT proposed establishing a fuel-testing<lb/> laboratory with a gas chromatographic to compare fuel obtained from retail outlets with fuel obtained from<lb/> distribution depots and refineries. With funding and support from the Environmental Partnership Grant<lb/> Program of the U.S. Council of State Governments, the US-Asian Environmental Partnership and the<lb/> government of Tamil Nadu, and technical support and training from the California Air Resources Board,<lb/> the project broke ground in 2003 and began operating in 2004.<lb/></figure>

			<p>After analyzing more than 60 retail gasoline and diesel fuel samples, CONCERT&apos;s data was highly<lb/> suggestive of contamination because adulterants were found at the high end of allowable concentrations.<lb/> Armed with evidence of likely fuel adulteration, CONCERT intends to expand its sampling programme,<lb/> upgrade and procure additional laboratory equipment, establish a mobile laboratory to collect and test<lb/> samples in the field, seek greater enforcement by government agencies, and increase outreach to retail fuel<lb/> dealers. CONCERT believes widespread fuel testing, coupled with greater enforcement, would<lb/> significantly improve air quality throughout India. CONCERT has informed the public and government<lb/> about the results of their fuel testing, and the agency is now working with the local air-quality agency and<lb/> NGOs to create more stringent fuel specifications.<lb/> All the equipment purchased for CONCERT&apos;s Fuel Testing Laboratory were indigenously<lb/> manufactured. Project managers would have preferred to purchase automated equipment with<lb/> computerized data-logging to speed up the process and increase the number of samples analyzed per unit<lb/> of time and labor. But the necessary resources were not available. While the Indian-made equipment took<lb/> longer to operate, it did not compromise the accuracy of analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sophisticated analytical equipment for fuel analysis is imported into India, but it is only utilised by the<lb/> oil companies for quality control and for research related to refinery operations. CONCERT staff believe<lb/> that if such equipment could be purchased, and if testing facilities could be established in every Indian<lb/> state, the nation&apos;s fuel supply --and hence its air quality --would be greatly improved.<lb/></p>

			<head>Goods associated with the project<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted above, in this project, the project participants from the United States lent expertise only; all<lb/> the equipment was procured within India.</p>
