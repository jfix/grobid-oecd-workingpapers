This would however require<lb/> appropriate policy instruments and real political will. Currently, project development activities are<lb/> at an early stage in China, India, and Indonesia for providing electricity to rural households by<lb/> harnessing energy from ocean waves and tidal currents. During 2007, Ponte di Archimede<lb/> International S.p.A. entered into three joint ventures with the People&apos;s Republic of China, Indonesia Page | 16<lb/> and the Philippines to install tidal current-based generation in remote villages. The Research and<lb/> Technology Ministries in the respective countries participated actively in the formation of these<lb/> ventures. The installation of tidal current projects of a similar size in remote villages is currently<lb/> being planned in China and the Philippines. A 2 MW tidal current plant is being considered by India<lb/> to bring electricity to a remote area near Sunderban in West Bengal. A low-temperature ocean<lb/> thermal desalination (LTTD) plant has been operating since 2005 at Kavaratti in Lakshadweep<lb/> islands in western India and that provides 100 m 3 per day of drinking water to a local community.<lb/> There are also significant opportunities to utilise wave and tidal current energy for sustainable<lb/> energisation of remote coastal areas in Mexico, Brazil and South Africa and activities are already<lb/> under way in these countries.</table>

It is limited to its east and north by the Atlantic Ocean, its<lb/> inland frontiers border with all Southern American countries except for Chile and Ecuador<lb/> (Wikipedia, 2009a). Brazil belongs to the so-called megadiverse countries, a group that<lb/> encompasses about 70% of the planet&apos;s biodiversity (WCMC, 1992). Particularly notable are its large<lb/> tropical Amazon and Atlantic coast rainforests as well as the large peatlands (the Pantanal) of the<lb/> midwest. Brazil also extends over semi-arid areas in the north-east (the Sertão) and vast plains in<lb/> the south. It has one of the world&apos;s most extensive river systems, including the Amazon and São<lb/> Francisco rivers. Most of the country lies between 200 and 800 metres in elevation. The weather is<lb/> mainly tropical (Wikipedia, 2009a).<lb/> Economic data<lb/> Over the past years, Brazil has enjoyed a period of stable economic growth with significant social<lb/> and environmental advances. While the country did not escape the global economic downturn in<lb/> 2008, Brazil has been able to cope with the crisis by relying on sound macroeconomic policies, as<lb/> well as by expanding its social security net, infrastructure and housing investments (World Bank,<lb/> 2009a). Real GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) growth has averaged 4.5% over the 2000-2007<lb/> period (OECD, 2009) before growth prospects dropped to 0.5% in 2009 because of the crisis (World<lb/> Bank, 2009a). GDP/PPP attained USD 1 833 billion in 2007 (OECD, 2009) but is highly concentrated<lb/> in a few regions: the three major economic states of the south-east (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and<lb/> Minas Gerais) account for over half (54.4%) of GDP (IBGE, 2007a). 6 Brazil&apos;s main foreign trade<lb/> partners include the European Union, the United States, Mercosur members, as well as China.<lb/> Population and economic profile<lb/> In 2000 Brazil undertook a census which reported a population close to 170 million inhabitants<lb/> (IBGE, 2002). By 2007 this number had increased to nearly 190 million people, an increase of about<lb/> 20 million in only eight years. While the urban population has been constantly rising throughout<lb/> these years (from 142 million in 2001 to 160 million in 2006), the rural population has remained<lb/> relatively constant at 30 million inhabitants (IBGE, 2007b). 7 Estimations of population density show much lower indices in rural areas (6.3 inhabitants/km 2 ) 8 than in urban areas (between 33.1 and<lb/> 36.8 inhabitants/km 2 ). 9 Of the total economically active population, the largest share works in<lb/> services (59.6%), followed by industry (28.0%) and agriculture (6.7%) (OECD, 2009).<lb/> There is no officially defined poverty line in Brazil; however, the concept of minimum wage is often<lb/> used in analyses. Accordingly, Silveira and Fernandes (2007) find that the number of indigent people<lb/> decreased from 12.4% in 2001 to about 7.6% in 2005, and the number of poor people from 28.7%<lb/> to 20.8%. 10 Brazil has thus already met the Millennium Development Goal of reducing substantially<lb/> the number of people living in poverty (World Bank, 2009a). Though poverty has been alleviated in<lb/> the past few years, extreme poverty still affects a large population, particularly in the country&apos;s<lb/> rural parts of the north-east (Presidency of the Republic, 2007; Silveira et al., 2007). Average rural<lb/> per-capita income is substantially lower than in urban areas: BRL 312 (USD 171) against BRL 689<lb/> (USD 377.5) (IBGE, 2007b</table>

In<lb/> 2007, the country&apos;s overall energy consumption reached 216 million tonnes of oil equivalent<lb/> (Mtoe), with demand driven mainly by petroleum derivates (41.4%, particularly diesel oil and<lb/> gasoline), electricity (16.4%), and sugar cane bagasse (12.4%) (EPE, 2008).

Both programmes also drew funding from different sources, the National<lb/> Treasury Funds in the case of PRODEEM, and Reserva Global de Reversão (Global Reversion<lb/> Reserve, or RGR) loans for utilities in the case of LnC (Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005).

About one-fourth of<lb/> the available RGR resources are set aside by law for low-income consumers in rural areas (ESMAP,<lb/> 2005). There were no other significant federal rural electrification funds.<lb/> In 2003 the current rural electrification programme, Luz para Todos (Light for All, or LpT), which is<lb/> to give universal access in the country&apos;s rural areas by 2010, was formalised and implemented. The<lb/> programme is based on the obligation for service providers to universalise rural electricity access<lb/> (as set by the Brazilian Constitution), on substantial federal and state resources for the service<lb/> providers, and on low tariffs for low-income and rural consumers (Zerriffi, 2007; Poppe, 2009).</table>

LpT&apos;s original aim was universal access to electricity in<lb/> all rural areas of Brazil by 2008, keeping in mind the five-year deadline defended by ANEEL. In total<lb/> numbers, Lpt was to provide two million rural connections (MME, 2003; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009)<lb/> for free to yet unattended consumers, where each household would also receive an &quot; internal kit &quot;<lb/> containing several power plugs, lamps, and other necessary material (Eletrobrás and MME, 2009).<lb/> Because of the surge of new demands for rural electrification not identified when the programme<lb/> started and for other reasons, the original LpT deadline was postponed to 2010 (Eletrobrás and<lb/> MME, 2009).<lb/> With LpT, a new institutional structure for rural electrification emerged, in which the Regulatory Agency<lb/> ANEEL (established during the electricity sector restructuring process during the 1990s) and Eletrobrás<lb/> play pivotal roles.

As connection costs within LpT are totally free for rural consumers,<lb/> in general any long-run costs occurring to the service providers (operation and management,<lb/> capital, and replacement costs) following electrification are to be covered by the service providers<lb/> themselves through electricity tariffs (ESMAP, 2005; Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a).

When<lb/> it started, the LpT programme had considerable difficulties in keeping up with the tight schedule set<lb/> by ANEEL: already by 2005 the deficit of electricity connections had reached nearly 270 thousand<lb/> households. Inexperience with LpT, political and administrative interferences, as well as supply<lb/> shortages of material and services including cables, posts, etc. caused by the explosion of demand<lb/> may explain part of these delays (Andrade, 2009b). In 2006, however, LpT&apos;s actual installations<lb/> surpassed planned installations, and thus led to a declining deficit. In 2008, LpT was about<lb/> 65 thousand installations short of the original targets. Finally, the pace of electrification is estimated<lb/> to increase substantially until 2010, with 510 thousand new installations planned for 2009 and<lb/> 578 thousand more for 2010, which is far above what had been realised the years before. These<lb/> planned connections correspond mainly to the newly identified rural electrification demand – the<lb/> original LpT target of two million installations had nearly been met in 2008 with 1.88 million<lb/> connections. At the beginning of LpT, Dilma Rousseff, Minister of the MME, defined LpT as &quot; a proposal to reduce<lb/> poverty and hunger, using electricity as a vector for development &quot; (MME, 2003, author&apos;s own<lb/> translation). This statement underlines that rural electrification is prioritised as a key objective of<lb/> Brazil&apos;s overall poverty alleviation strategy (ESMAP</table>

        <figure type="table">

            <table>). Thus until 2009, 4.62 million posts, 883 thousand km of<lb/> cable, and 708 thousand transformers have been installed within the universalisation strategy<lb/> (MME, 2009b).<lb/> Large reliance on grid extension to attain universal rural access may not be economical in the future<lb/> as LpT is now expected to reach out to the marginally more remote and dispersed consumers away<lb/> from the existing distribution lines (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a; Andrade, 2009b). 18 Nevertheless,<lb/> according to MME, the remaining one million connections planned for 2009 and 2010 (see Table 1)<lb/> will still be realised largely through extensions of the grid. It should be noted that already under the<lb/> LnC phase, lack of incentives to provide low-cost connections and non-grid electrification had been<lb/> perceived (Goldemberg et al., 2004). Connection costs may reach USD 4 000 and more if population<lb/> density is low and consumers are dispersed. These costs are well above any international<lb/> benchmark, and electrification options other than grid extensions may provide much cheaper<lb/> alternatives in such cases (ESMAP, 2005; Reiche et al., 2006).<lb/> Renewable energy has been used very little in the beginning of LpT (Pertusier, 2004). Even by end of<lb/> 2006, only around 3 100 solar home systems (SHS) had been installed under LpT, although it had<lb/> been estimated that for 17 500 localities – translating into some 130 000 systems – such systems<lb/> would be the most cost-effective option (IEA, 2009d). Decentralised renewable electrification<lb/> options, by either individual systems or mini-grids, could play a more relevant role during the 2009-<lb/>2010 period, particularly in the remote and isolated villages of the Amazon region. There are still<lb/> many rural isolated communities in the Amazon that cannot be assisted by the conventional system. 19 However, the use of expensive diesel generators in this region is still the norm (Andrade,<lb/> 2009b). It is estimated that in the Amazon region 80% of the unattended communities have less<lb/> than 30 households (Amazonas Energia, 2009), and very few settlements have more than<lb/> 100 inhabitants. Because of the distance from the main transmission and distribution lines, grid<lb/> extension for these communities is economically unviable.

            <table>a total population of 1 325 bn people in 2008 (World Bank, 2009c), China ranks first in the<lb/> world. Almost half of the population (45%) live in cities while 55 % live in rural areas. In the past, Page | 36<lb/> subject to a strict local residence permit system, domestic migration from rural to urban areas was<lb/> nearly impossible. In recent years, rural to urban migration has been more prominent. In this<lb/> context, latest estimates suggest that China&apos;s urbanisation rate will increase by nearly 1% per year<lb/> during the next 15 to 20 years, which represents around 300 million people who will move from<lb/> rural areas into cities (China Daily, 2009). Today, China&apos;s average population density is<lb/> approximately 138 per km 2 (Wikipedia, 2009b), but with extreme variations in rural population<lb/> densities, ranging from less than one to more than 400 per km 2 . In stark contrast, the highest urban<lb/> population density per km 2 is 50 000 to 60 000 as in the case of central Beijing, Shanghai and<lb/> Chongqing (China Daily, 2009).<lb/> Of the total working population, 40.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.8 % in industry and 32.4% in<lb/> services (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2008).

            <table>Since 1998, China has invested more than CNY 400 bn (USD 58.68 bn) in construction of power<lb/> plants in rural areas (Tang, 2009) of which USD 49.5 billion over the past seven years. 33 By the end<lb/> of 2005, the State Grid Corporation had invested over USD 27.89 billion in two phases of rural<lb/> power grid renovation (State Grid Corporation of China, 2009); USD 5.98 billion was invested in the<lb/> renovation of county power grids and USD 50.81 million in the renovation of the western power<lb/> grid; 20 % of these investments came from Treasury Bonds as capital, the remaining 80% from bank<lb/> loans. After the renovation of the rural grids, the depreciation cost and financial cost of the State<lb/> Grid Corporation have increased substantially. According to the &quot;Rural Grid Programme for the<lb/> Eleventh Five-Year Period by the State Grid Corporation&quot;, during the period covered by the plan, the<lb/> estimated investment in rural grids by the Corporation will be USD 16.57 billion, of which<lb/> USD 3.31 billion of capital, and USD 13.26 billion of bank loans. The average annual investment will<lb/> be USD 3.26 billion, of which USD 0.65 billion of capital, and USD 2.61 billion of bank loans. 34 Page | 53<lb/> Brightness Programme/Township Programme<lb/> The national &quot; Township Programme &quot; , authorised by the State Council in 2001, was initiated in mid-<lb/>2002 with the goal to supply electricity to the remaining 1 065 administrative townships 35 in rural<lb/> western China. The programme has cost CNY 4.97 bn (USD 730 million) of which CNY 2 bn<lb/> (USD 293 million) came from the central government and the rest from provincial and township<lb/> governments. Through a competitive bidding procedure at the provincial level, the so-called system<lb/> integrators responsible for the installation, operation and maintenance for three years were<lb/> selected. Most systems were installed during the mid-2002 to 2004 period. In total, 989 power<lb/> stations were constructed of which 721 are PV and PV/wind hybrid systems with a total capacity of<lb/> 15.53 MW and 146 small hydropower stations with a total capacity of 113 MW.</table>

            <figDesc>companies under permanent financial strain. Rural grids need constant renovation and<lb/> maintenance. Page | 57<lb/> Main remaining challenges linked to the Brightness Programme/Township Programme<lb/> Use of unsuitable material: As a first step towards the ambitious objectives of the Brightness<lb/> Programme, a three-year pilot phase was launched in 1999 in three provinces. A survey conducted<lb/> by the Institute of Electrical Engineering (JKD) in Inner Mongolia in late 2003 (Chinese Academy of<lb/> Science, 2003) revealed that out of 5 240 PV/wind/battery hybrid systems for which statistics were<lb/> available, a total of 2 119 systems (40.4%) were malfunctioning. Problems with the inverters/charge<lb/> controllers accounted for 1 099 sets (20.9%) followed by 657 problems with batteries (12.5%) and<lb/> 363 problems with wind turbines (6.9%). On-site investigations suggested that the bearings of wind<lb/> turbines were made out of unsuitable copper material. The main causes of the exceptionally high<lb/> proportion of malfunctioning charge controllers/inverters were poor technical design and the<lb/> utilisation of unsuitable material during assembly. Consequently, the malfunctioning charge<lb/> controller/inverter shortened the lifetime of 657 batteries. As a result, a general dissatisfaction<lb/> among end-users prevailed and led in many cases to the refusal to pay the final instalment for the<lb/> systems. Table 16 provides an overview of future costs to 2020. 36<lb/> Unclear long-term operation and maintenance: When the Township Electrification Programme was<lb/> designed, government financial support was almost entirely earmarked for the procurement of<lb/> hardware. Through a competitive bidding system, system integrators were selected and according<lb/> to what the bidding documents stipulated, their responsibility merely included the design,<lb/> construction, operation and maintenance of the off-grid systems. However, this lasted only three<lb/> years. Today, more than six years after the Township Electrification Programme was initiated, a<lb/> number of pressing issues are still pending here and there, e.g. ownership (transfer from national to<lb/> provincial/township government), management (financial and contractual requirements for<lb/> Renewable Energy Service Companies, RESCOs), financial support (governmental subsidies to cover<lb/> expenses incurred for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) during the 20 years of the system&apos;s life),<lb/> tariff setting (official guidelines to set a tariff to be paid by end-users and how the difference in<lb/> tariffs can be balanced through the provisions made in the Chinese Renewable Energy Law).<lb/> Moreover, ownership in most of the provinces has not been defined, so that many entities are<lb/> unwilling to take responsibility for operation and maintenance, causing problems in daily<lb/> management, bill collection, equipment replacements and repairs, etc. Different tariffs (there is no<lb/> single tariff for all townships), lead to insufficient revenues earmarked for O&amp;M. The collection of<lb/> one end-user tariff is not sufficient to cover all the costs incurred for O&amp;M, replacement of<lb/> components, repairs and the monthly salary of local technicians/operators. Thus, continued<lb/> financial support from the government is indispensable.<lb/> Long-term technical reliability: Many technologies used in the electrification programme have<lb/> never been applied on a large scale and some were even specifically developed for this programme.<lb/> This poses the question of long-term reliability of the technologies applied.<lb/> 36 In the course of the survey involving 11 out of 13 system integrators, budget estimates were compiled<lb/> covering the potential lifetime of village power PV systems over the 2006-2020 period. In total, four cost<lb/> categories have been identified.<lb/> -Operation &amp; maintenance of PV systems (primarily maintenance and monthly salary of on-site local<lb/> operator);<lb/> -Cost to cover the technical support rendered by Renewable Energy Service Companies&apos; routine<lb/> inspection, labour, problem-solving, communication, management, reasonable profit;<lb/> -Cost to cover the replacement of equipment (twice battery replacement, major repair, other<lb/> electronic devices such as inverter, controller, mini-grid);<lb/> -Other cost (training and unforeseen expenses).</figDesc>

Some<lb/> concessionaires have been providing maintenance for the systems, charging on a fee-for-service<lb/> basis, while others have not provided this service. Non-payment of bills has also been a cause for<lb/> concern in most concessionaires and lack of expected government capital subsidies has delayed<lb/> much of the work. Decision making concerning the definition of a non-grid area has also caused<lb/> delays and costs to the concessionaires. These difficulties have weakened the financial stability of<lb/> the concessionaires and delayed the installation process.</table>

            <table>revenues.<lb/> An important by-product of the INEP is the adoption of standard methodologies, coupled with a<lb/> greater awareness of technology options. The standards were established after broad stakeholder<lb/> consultations, including electricity utility practitioners, equipment suppliers, regulatory bodies and<lb/> end-user representatives. These standards are now widely used not only in South Africa but also<lb/> throughout the Southern African region. The INEP provides incentives for a range of new<lb/> technologies, including planning tools, to meet a variety of site-specific conditions during the roll-<lb/>out of the programme. In the case of South Africa&apos;s electrification programme the policy of &quot; inventing &quot; technologies<lb/> specifically for the poor has not been successful. If solar water heating had been used by the richer<lb/> households and in the cities, then the technology could have been extended to the poorer<lb/> communities. The rapid flow of information has determined electrification preferences of the<lb/> people. Cities have been electrified through grid extension. Renewable energy is publicly called<lb/> &quot; rural energy &quot; , and this has led to the negative image attached to all renewable energy applications.<lb/> The implementation of the DoE programme for renewable energy has been slow and the share of<lb/> renewable energy in power supply is still insignificant. In 2008, Eskom launched a programme to<lb/> subsidise solar water heating (SWH), but the subsidy level was too low and required massive<lb/> administration and control systems so that the programme has had little success. Since 2008 some<lb/> municipalities have introduced SWH as a way of avoiding load shedding by Eskom. In early 2009<lb/> South Africa announced a feed-in tariff for grid-connected renewable energy.</table>
