A more recent example of such developmental effects of major road investments is discernable in<lb/> Sri Lanka (Gunasekara, Anderson and Lakshmanan 2007 forthcoming). The broader literature on<lb/> transport and economic development suggests that transport infrastructure facilitates the transformation of low-income economies from subsistence to commercial agriculture, the development of basic, transport-<lb/>intensive industries and the growth of cites (Haynes and Button, 2001).<lb/> It would be a mistake to think that developmental impacts occur only at an early stage of<lb/> economic development. Even in a mature economy, transportation infrastructure improvements might<lb/> promote structural changes such as increased decentralization or agglomeration of economic activity;<lb/> changes in the way business enterprises conduct operations such as inventory management, logistics and<lb/> other practices; enhanced opportunities for face-to-face interaction; and a range of new recreational<lb/> opportunities (Anderson and Lakshmanan, 2007.) These impacts, which affect the long-term evolution of<lb/> the economy, are difficult to measure and even more difficult to predict. Nevertheless they are important,<lb/> and a better understanding of developmental effects should lead to better decision-making on<lb/> transportation infrastructure.</table>

Parry<lb/> and Bento (2001) note that the ability to substitute between transport modes mitigates the cost of reducing<lb/> congestion. Our assumption that households and firms substitute among both transport modes and<lb/> network segments means that the elasticities in the aforementioned CES and CET functions will likely be<lb/> a key influence on the marginal benefit of investments to increase the capacity of congested links.<lb/> </figDesc>
