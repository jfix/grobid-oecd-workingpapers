	<div type="abstract">• Excess capacity is hurting the global steel industry. Excessive levels of steelmaking capacity<lb/> have important implications for the steel industry, resulting in over-supply, low prices, weak<lb/> profitability, bankruptcies and localised job losses. Given the global nature of the industry, excess<lb/> capacity in one region can displace production in other regions, thus harming producers in those<lb/> markets and creating risks for trade actions and government interventions to protect domestic<lb/> industries. It can also lead to wasteful energy use and thus have negative environmental impacts.<lb/> • What should be done? In competitive economies, it is the responsibility of the steel companies<lb/> themselves to identify ways to adapt to changing market conditions. The role of governments<lb/> should be to allow market mechanisms to work properly and avoid measures that artificially<lb/> support steelmaking capacity. Of particular importance for governments will be to work towards<lb/> removing market distorting policies such as subsidies that promote the emergence of new<lb/> capacity or delay the closure of failing companies, eliminating trade and investment barriers that<lb/> slow the restructuring that is needed for the industry, allowing market-based investment decisions<lb/> in the steel sector, and ensuring that new plants are subject to standards that protect the<lb/> environment and uphold worker safety.</div>
