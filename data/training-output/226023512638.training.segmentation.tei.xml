			<front>TOWARDS HARMONISED BILATERAL TRADE DATA FOR INTER-COUNTRY <lb/>INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSES: STATISTICAL ISSUES * <lb/>Dong Guo, Colin Webb and Norihiko Yamano <lb/>Economic Analysis and Statistics Division <lb/>Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry (DSTI), OECD <lb/>colin.webb@oecd.org <lb/>norihiko.yamano@oecd.org <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Understanding the increasingly complex structures of international trade is an important concern for <lb/>policy makers, as deepening economic integration is characterised by the growing trade in intermediate <lb/>goods and services between countries. Analyses based on international input-output tables can help address <lb/>trade-related policy issues as well as providing other insights into the socio-economic and environmental <lb/>impacts of globalisation. To link national input-output tables in order to carry out interdependent analyses <lb/>across countries requires a consistent set of harmonised international bilateral trade data that ideally <lb/>reflects recent output by the economic activities in question. This paper discusses the challenges faced <lb/>when attempting to construct appropriate bilateral trade matrices using annual data collected by the OECD <lb/>and United Nations, as well as national sources. While the main focus is on the increasing presence of <lb/> &quot; re-exports &quot; in reported exports of goods data, this paper also addresses some other statistical and data <lb/>issues that need to be considered, such as treatment of confidential (or &quot; unallocated &quot; ) trade in goods; trade <lb/>in secondhand goods, scrap metal and other waste; differences in trade statistics across international <lb/>statistical agencies; and the additional problems encountered when converting product-based trade data to <lb/>industry-based classifications. Issues concerning Balance of Payments data, the main source for trade in <lb/>services, are also addressed. <lb/> * <lb/>A draft of this paper was presented to OECD&apos;s Working Party on International Trade in Goods and Trade <lb/>in Services Statistics (WPTGS) organised by OECD in September 2008 (www.oecd.org/std/its/wptgs2008). <lb/>The authors would like to thank the participants of this meeting.

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Economic globalisation is currently characterised not only by increasing international trade in final <lb/>goods but also by increasing trade in intermediate goods and service transactions, as innovation and <lb/>production processes are fragmented across countries. The structure of such trends can be tracked by <lb/>carefully constructed multi-national input-output (I-O) tables. To do so, researchers link standardised (or <lb/>harmonised) national I-O tables to international bilateral trade matrices using standard assumptions (see <lb/>Box 1). In recent years, the OECD has undertaken efforts to improve and increase the coverage of its <lb/>database of harmonised I-O tables, not least to incorporate major non-OECD countries such as Brazil, <lb/>China, India, Indonesia and Russia (Yamano and Ahmad, 2006). A useful feature of the OECD I-O tables <lb/>is that intermediate inputs are divided into goods and services that are domestically-produced and those <lb/>that are imported. To extend the analytical power of this data set, OECD is embarking on a project to <lb/>develop bilateral trade matrices that can help identify the country of origin of imported intermediate inputs <lb/>and be used to link I-O tables. However, this requires analyses of currently available international bilateral <lb/>trade data to identify areas where adjustments may be required to best match the estimates of exports and <lb/>imports in I-O tables. <lb/>This paper discusses the challenges faced when attempting to construct consistent bilateral trade <lb/>matrices using the widely used annual databases of international trade hosted by the OECD and United <lb/>Nations Statistical Division (UNSD) 1 as well as national sources. While the focus is on identifying and <lb/>measuring re-exported goods, other reasons for inconsistencies in so-called mirror trade are discussed, as <lb/>is the issue of identifying internationally traded goods that were not manufactured recently (for example <lb/>secondhand goods, scrap metal and other waste products). The additional problems faced when attempting <lb/>to convert trade data from product classifications to industry classification are also addressed – not least <lb/>identifying imported intermediate products. While the discussion mainly concerns international trade in <lb/>goods, one cannot ignore the issues concerning measurement of international trade in services and the <lb/>related methodological requirements for compiling Balance of Payments (BOP) accounts. National <lb/>Supply-Use tables (SUTs) and I-O tables are constructed within the framework of National Accounts <lb/>(according to SNA93 2 or, in EU, ESA95 recommendations) which use BOP definitions for aggregate <lb/>international trade data. Ultimately, to link national harmonised I-O tables, matrices with &quot; adjusted &quot; <lb/>bilateral trade data for both goods and services are required. Discussion of certain types of international <lb/>trade in services such as Foreign Affiliates Trade in Services (FATS) data is not included here but can be <lb/>found in separate studies such as Bensidoun and Ünal-Kesenci (2008) 3 . <lb/>1. <lb/>For trade in goods, OECD&apos;s International Trade in Commodity Statistics (ITCS) and U.N.&apos;s Comtrade <lb/>database. <lb/>2. <lb/>http://unstats.un.org/unsd/sna1993/toctop.asp. <lb/>3. <lb/>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) recognises four modes of provision of trade in <lb/>services. BOP covers modes 1 and 2 (Cross-border supply and Consumption abroad) while FATS mainly <lb/>covers mode 3 (Commercial presence). Mode 4 (Presence of natural persons) can be found in both BOP <lb/>and FATS. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. Using inter-regional trade matrices in input-output systems <lb/>In general, to measure economic interactions between regions, there are two different types of input-output <lb/>systems that can take account of trade flows: inter-regional input-output (IRIO) and multi-regional input-output (MRIO). <lb/>For IRIO, suppose that an inter-regional trade flow can be expressed as <lb/>-i.e. the value of intermediate <lb/>goods from industry i in region h purchased by industry j in region m; that <lb/>is the total output of industry j in <lb/>region m; that <lb/>is the final demand of output from industry j in region m by region h (for private or <lb/>government consumption or investment); and that N and R represent the number of industries and regions, <lb/>respectively; then in IRIO, the total output of industry j in region m can be written as: <lb/>where <lb/>= <lb/>are the input coefficients. In IRIO, the data requirements are substantial as consistent matrices <lb/>of inter-regional, inter-industry trade are required. <lb/>Alternatively, in MRIO some assumptions are made in order to build matrices with reduced data requirements. <lb/>Notably, it uses transactions data where the sector of destination is ignored. Rather than using trade flows between <lb/>industries i and j, MRIO requires <lb/>: the value of goods from industry i that region m ships from region h. This <lb/>yields the proportion of goods from industry i in region m shipped from other regions, also known as the trade <lb/>coefficient of region m of goods from industry i and expressed as <lb/>with <lb/>=1. With each <lb/>region&apos;s input coefficient <lb/>( <lb/>, m = 1, 2, …, R) available, then in the MRIO system, the inter-regional flow <lb/>can be expressed as: <lb/>Note that <lb/>is the total final demand of output from industry j in region m. <lb/>Source: Isard et al. (1998, Chapter 3) <lb/>For measuring trade flows among the 40 or so countries targeted in the OECD I-O database, the trade coefficient <lb/>matrix can be estimated using OECD&apos;s STAN Bilateral Trade by industry Database (BTD) for member countries and <lb/>for non-member countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN GOODS: STATISTICAL ISSUES AND DATA ISSUES <lb/>2.1. Origins of problems with &quot; mirror statistics &quot; – an overview <lb/>Trade is the activity of buying, selling, or exchanging goods or services within a country or between <lb/>countries. In this paper we concentrate on international trade between countries. Statistically, international <lb/>merchandise trade in goods measures physical movements of goods across international frontiers. In <lb/>Balance of Payments, BPM5 definitions, international trade should be recorded when there has been a <lb/>change of ownership of goods between a resident and non-resident. <lb/>When conducting analyses of trade flows between countries or regions, it is highly desirable that <lb/>merchandise trade data recorded by country A for exports to country B match data recorded by country B <lb/>for imports from country A in order to produce consistent A-B trade flow matrices by year (and by <lb/>commodity groups). Unfortunately this is rarely the case. Problems with &quot; mirror statistics &quot; occur for many <lb/>reasons, including: <lb/>• different valuations for imports (c.i.f.) and exports (f.o.b.) 4 ;<lb/>• different trade recording systems for imports and exports, general v. special trade 4 ;<lb/>• differences across countries in definitions of trade partners;<lb/>• differences in thresholds for recording international trade 5 which by extension means differences <lb/>in definition of trade in &quot; small transactions &quot; ;<lb/>• consequences of &quot; merchanting &quot; ; and<lb/>• others, such as timing of measurement (recording by customs), differing allocation of product <lb/>classification to goods or mis-attribution; and smuggling (Tsigas et al.1992).<lb/>At an aggregate level, in the context of National Accounts and Balance of Payments (BoP), <lb/>adjustments are made to merchandise trade in goods to produce more consistent estimates. For example, <lb/>valuation adjustments for imports (i.e. costs of insurance and freight are deducted from imports of goods <lb/>and added to imports of services), adjustments due to timing (i.e. when time of change in ownership does <lb/>not coincide with movement of goods), and adjustments when there has been a change in ownership but <lb/>the goods have not crossed the customs frontier (for example, large value capital items such as ships and <lb/>aircraft). However, few national authorities make such BoP adjustments at more detailed levels – either by <lb/>partner country or by commodity (even for relatively aggregate levels). Also, while the United Nations <lb/>(1998) provides clear recommendations on defining trade partners, practices may differ across countries <lb/>when compiling trade statistics. Close attention needs to be paid to national definitions when looking at <lb/>trade statistics. <lb/>For analyses of the impact of globalisation, linking harmonised I-O tables with consistent trade <lb/>matrices can provide a range of interesting insights (inter-dependencies etc.). While the general problems <lb/>4 . <lb/>For definitions of different trade systems, c.i.f. and f.o.b., please refer to Table 3. <lb/>5. <lb/>In the EU, external trade statistics apply a transaction threshold system. Transactions below a certain value <lb/>or quantity do not have to be reported by Member States. For extra-EU trade this threshold is currently <lb/>EUR 1 000 or 1 000 kg in net mass. For intra-EU trade statistics the threshold is EUR 200. <lb/>(see: http://europa.eu.int/estatref/info/sdds/en/ext/ext_sm.htm). Note that the EU Intrastat system is the <lb/>main reason for differences in trade statistics published by OECD/UN and EU (see Lindner, 2008). <lb/></body>

			<body>connected with mirror statistics need to be addressed, an increasingly significant problem across an <lb/>increasing number of countries is the presence of &quot; re-exports &quot; in recorded trade statistics. Indeed it is a <lb/>major reason for the existing discrepancies between international trade data reported by importers and <lb/>exporters. <lb/>2.2. Re-exports <lb/>According to the UN definition of general trade flows (United Nations, 1998), re-exports take place <lb/>when goods enter a customs territory from one country and are shipped to another country without being <lb/>transformed 6 . It is also known as transhipment (see Mellens et al., 2007, Andriamananjara et al., 2004, <lb/>Fung and Lau, 1998). Although rarely recorded separately in published national or international databases, <lb/>re-exports can sometimes be distinguished from other trade flows as demonstrated by Roos (2005, 2006) in <lb/>the case of the Netherlands (where re-exports now account for over 40% of recorded exports). <lb/>The presence of re-exports is most likely in those countries and regions with favourable geographical <lb/>positions from a perspective of intercontinental transportation. These include the Netherlands, Belgium, <lb/>Germany, and possibly France in Europe, and Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia, in the sense that these <lb/>countries act as the hubs for shipments of trade between countries of their continental region and the rest of <lb/>the world. For example, major hub functions between the European economy and the rest of the world are <lb/>located at Dutch and Belgian ports while the ports of Hong Kong play a similar role for eastern Asia. In <lb/>this context it should be noted that over 80% of the world&apos;s trade in goods is transported by sea (UNCTAD, <lb/>2008). <lb/>When coupled with differences across countries in definitions of country of origin and country of <lb/>consignment for import partners, re-exports (and re-imports) can significantly increase export/import <lb/>discrepancies between countries. For example, if China exports USD 5 million worth of <lb/>domestically-produced goods to the US via Hong Kong, then effectively China exports USD 5 million <lb/>worth of domestically-produced goods to Hong Kong and Hong Kong re-exports the same amount to the <lb/>US (see Figure 1). <lb/>Figure 1. An example of flows of goods in three countries/regions <lb/>6. <lb/>A brief note about exports and re-exports is attached to UN Comtrade database at <lb/>http://comtrade.un.org/kb/article.aspx?id=10152. <lb/>Hong Kong <lb/>The US <lb/>• Imported the same <lb/>USD 5 million in goods <lb/>from China <lb/>(recorded as imports <lb/>from China)<lb/>• Re-exported to China <lb/>USD 5 million <lb/>(recorded as re-exports <lb/>to the US)<lb/>• Exported <lb/>USD 5 million <lb/>in domestically-<lb/>produced goods<lb/>China <lb/>• Imported <lb/>USD 5 million in <lb/>goods from Hong Kong<lb/>to Hong Kong <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2009)4 <lb/></body>

Taking the above example whereby China exports domestically-produced goods to <lb/>the U.S. via Hong Kong, from the perspective of Hong Kong, imports from China are recorded as <lb/>re-exports to the U.S. as shown in Figure 1. However, for both China and the U.S., data compilers may <lb/>record the transaction differently depending on the information available to them. Both countries follow <lb/>the recommendations of the United Nations (1998) to define their trading partners, as country of origin for <lb/>imports and last known destination for exports. However, the US also accepts the country of shipment as <lb/>an import partner country if the country of origin could not be identified. Note that, the last known <lb/>destination also limits the information known at the time of exports as specified by the UN (1998). <lb/>Therefore, there are potentially four different combinations recording the 5-million-dollar trade transaction: <lb/>1. China knows the last known destination of the exported goods is the U.S., and the U.S. identifies the origin <lb/>of the goods as China; <lb/>2. China knows the last known destination of the exported goods is the U.S., however, the U.S. cannot <lb/>identify the origin of the imports, but can only track that it is shipped from Hong Kong; <lb/>3. China only knows the exports go to Hong Kong 7 , no further information of future destination is available, <lb/>but somehow, the U.S. knows the origin of their imports are from China; and <lb/>4. China only knows the exports go to Hong Kong, no further information of future destination is available; <lb/>the U.S. cannot track the origin of the import but only the shipment region, Hong Kong. <lb/>The different recordings are also illustrated in Figure 1. In fact, this example reflects the reality of the <lb/>long-existing and controversial trade discrepancies between China and the U.S. as shown in Table 1. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Note that this example does not deal with the possibility of mark-ups in Hong Kong (via branding, <lb/>re-packaging etc.) before the goods are shipped to the U.S. so that, for example, the USD 50 million worth <lb/>of goods shipped from China to Hong Kong become USD 60 million worth of goods imported by the USA. <lb/>2.2.1. Re-exports – a growing phenomenon <lb/>As liberalisation of global trade increases, more countries, particularly those with a special trade <lb/>status or geographical location (such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Hong Kong and Singapore), are paying <lb/>more attention to their trade flows as domestically-produced goods account for less of the total volume of <lb/>trade with their partner countries. As a result, increasing asymmetries in trade statistics with their partner <lb/>countries are becoming apparent (Geyer-Schaefer 2007). The classic case is the trade discrepancy between <lb/>China and the U.S. where re-exports from Hong Kong account for a very large share (see Table 2). In the <lb/>case of the Netherlands, the trend of increasing re-exports started in the mid-80s, and has continued since <lb/>then. Currently, re-exports account for more than 40% of the total exports in the country compared to less <lb/>than 20% in 1990 (Mellens et al., 2007; Kusters and Verbruggen, 2001). Increasing re-exports is a <lb/>worldwide trend, affecting not only Hong Kong and the Netherlands but countries such as Singapore and <lb/>Germany. For Hong Kong the average growth rate of re-exports was about 18% from 1983 to 2005, while <lb/>for the Netherlands it was about 9% between 1985 and 1997, and for Germany the annual growth in <lb/>re-exports from 1992 to 2002 was about 14%. Estimates of re-exports as a share of total exports varies <lb/>across countries – in Germany it is about 15%, in Singapore, more that 50%, while in Hong Kong, it is <lb/>around 95% (Mellens et al., 2007). <lb/>Table 2. Re-exports through Hong Kong (USD billion) <lb/>Source: Fung and Lau (2003) Table 2. <lb/>As mentioned earlier, UN (1998) considers re-exports to be foreign goods exported from any part of <lb/>the economic territory of a country in the same state 8 as previously imported 9 . However, in practice, <lb/>countries have different ways to define and account for re-exports and consequently different methods for <lb/>refining trade flow data. In the Netherlands, for example, re-exports are imported goods leaving the <lb/>Netherlands in a largely unprocessed state. That is, a Dutch trader may buy goods in the United States, <lb/>store them in his own warehouse searching for a buyer, and then export them to Germany. There are three <lb/>different ways to define the re-exports, which are (1) based on the origin criteria, (2) based on the rule of <lb/>8. <lb/>The term &quot; goods in the same state &quot; includes goods which underwent processing that did not change their <lb/>origin. Re-packing, splitting into lots, sorting or grading, marking and the like are not considered as <lb/>undergoing a process of transformation of a good. <lb/>9. <lb/>For the definition of re-export flows in general trade systems and special trade systems, see United Nations <lb/>(1998), page 27, paragraph 78 and page 30, paragraph 84, respectively. <lb/>Year <lb/>Hong Kong re-exports of <lb/>U.S. goods to China <lb/>(Hong Kong data) <lb/>Hong Kong re-exports as a <lb/>share of official U.S. data <lb/>on exports to China (%) <lb/>Hong Kong re-exports of <lb/>Chinese goods to the U.S. <lb/>(Hong Kong data) <lb/>Hong Kong re-exports as a <lb/>share of official Chinese <lb/>data on exports to the U.S. (%) <lb/>1995 <lb/>5.0 <lb/>42.7 <lb/>27.6 <lb/>111.7 <lb/>1996 <lb/>5.9 <lb/>49.2 <lb/>29.2 <lb/>109.4 <lb/>1997 <lb/>6.0 <lb/>46.9 <lb/>31.3 <lb/>95.7 <lb/>1998 <lb/>5.3 <lb/>37.1 <lb/>31.1 <lb/>81.8 <lb/>1999 <lb/>5.4 <lb/>41.2 <lb/>32.1 <lb/>76.6 <lb/>2000 <lb/>6.1 <lb/>37.7 <lb/>36.5 <lb/>70.1 <lb/>2001 <lb/>6.5 <lb/>33.9 <lb/>33.3 <lb/>61.3 <lb/>2002 <lb/>6.2 <lb/>28.1 <lb/>34.3 <lb/>49.0 <lb/></body>

			<body>value added, (3) the change code of a good. A distinction also has to be made for other types of flows such <lb/>as transit and quasi transit via a custom warehouse or through the Netherlands (Roos, 2005). <lb/>2.2.2. Re-exports – methodological issues <lb/>Roos (2005) presented some ways to identify and measure re-exports in the Netherlands. In practice, <lb/>companies in the Netherlands have to provide Statistics Netherlands with a code to specify the trade flow <lb/>in order to distinguish re-exports from domestic exports. In practice, not every company provides the <lb/>correct code and as a result only one-third of what is assumed to be re-exports are reported in this way. <lb/>Re-exports can be estimated by using the information in the supply-and-use tables of National <lb/>Accounts. This method can provide estimates at a reasonably detailed level of products and was applied to <lb/>estimate re-exports of the Netherlands in the nineties (Roos, 2006). However, it has the drawback of only <lb/>providing data at the total world level i.e. without additional information by partner country. Another way <lb/>of identifying re-exports is to compare the volume of imports to the volume of exports of the company. If <lb/>measured imports are more or less equal to exports for the same product code, then the exports are <lb/>probably re-exports, while if measured exports are notably higher than imports, then there is some <lb/>domestic production. Usually the largest exporters are profiled to enhance the estimations. Note that some <lb/>other factors, such as production structure, can be taken into account of estimating re-exports. For example, <lb/>if certain goods are not produced or grown in a country (e.g. bananas), then all exports of such goods can <lb/>be considered re-exports (Roos, 2006). <lb/>In New Zealand re-exports are defined as &quot; merchandise exports that were earlier imported into <lb/>New Zealand and comprise less than 50 percent New Zealand content by value. &quot; New Zealand has adopted <lb/>a value-added-based assessment to determine whether a &quot; transformation &quot; of a good is &quot; substantial &quot; , which <lb/>is called &quot; 50 percent New Zealand content by value &quot; . Actually, it is a simplified definition, referring to the <lb/>exact rules of origin in the Customs and Excise Regulations that govern whether a good is of domestic or <lb/>foreign origin. In detail, the &quot; 50 percent rule of origin &quot; is calculated as: <lb/>Qualifying Expenditure (QE) <lb/>Factory Cost (FC) <lb/>which is expressed as a percentage, where qualifying expenditure (QE) are domestic expenditure on <lb/>materials, labour &amp; overheads, while Factory Cost (FC) are the total expenditure on materials, labour and <lb/>overheads, including (1) the purchase price, (2) overseas freight and insurance, (3) port and clearance <lb/>charges, and (4) inward transport to store, but not (1) customs duty, (2) anti-dumping duty, (3) excise duty, <lb/>and (4) sales &amp; goods and services taxes. In March 2004, New Zealand implemented an electronic system <lb/>for tracing the origin of a good being exported through New Zealand customs. This allows the timely <lb/>transfer of monthly export statistics to Statistics New Zealand so that re-export statistics can be compiled <lb/>along with the total exports statistics 10 . Note that trade statistics in New Zealand are compiled at a detailed, <lb/>10-digit, level of the Harmonised System. <lb/>In Hong Kong, more than 90% of merchandise trade is due to re-exports (re-imports) mainly <lb/>involving China. This high-profile case of re-exports has been recognised by many researchers in recent <lb/>years with much effort going into making necessary adjustments to trade statistics prior to analyses. For <lb/>example, in the series of analyses by Fung and Lau since 1998, they have used the trade data from China, <lb/>the US and Hong Kong to re-adjust the data on bilateral trade between the US and China by taking into <lb/>account different aspects of the issues which could cause discrepancies, such as estimates of re-exports by <lb/>10. <lb/>For more detail, see Statistics New Zealand (2006). <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2009)4 <lb/></body>

			<body>Hong Kong not previously covered (1998), the measurement of exports and imports 11 ; smuggling, mark-up <lb/>rate and trade in services (2001, 2003) – adjusting the data covering the period from 1998 to 2002. <lb/>Recently Ferrantino and Wang (2007) tried to explore reasons for discrepancies by establishing a <lb/>regression model. <lb/>Further, Noda (1997) and Feenstra et al. (2005) provide some methods to build trade matrices by <lb/>using more extensive trade statistics. For example, Noda (1997) constructed a Hong Kong re-export trade <lb/>matrix by using detailed re-exports statistics from 1988 to 1995. If the re-export value of a certain <lb/>commodity from original country A i to trading partner A j via Hong Kong is designated as e ij , then the total <lb/>re-exporting value of this commodity to trading partner A j from different origin countries via Hong Kong, <lb/>ReX j , can be expressed as Re X j = e ij <lb/>i=1 <lb/>m <lb/>∑ , where m is the number of originating countries. Note that <lb/>Hong Kong merchandise trade statistics are compiled at the 8-digit level of HS. <lb/>Feenstra et al. (2005), on the other hand, adjusted the trade flows between China/Hong Kong and <lb/>other countries by taking into account the re-exports between China and Hong Kong. Their starting point is <lb/>to consider the value-added generated in Hong Kong when the re-exports occur. Different mark-up rates <lb/>are applied to different destination countries based on 1-digit SITC level according to the availability of <lb/>trade statistics for Chinese exports to Hong Kong and the Hong Kong re-exports of the same commodities. <lb/>That is, the mark-up of the value added is calculated by multiplying the mark-up rate to the value of <lb/>Chinese re-exports through Hong Kong to the destination countries. However, in order to avoid the <lb/>situation in which the Hong Kong re-export value added is higher than the import value from China as <lb/>reported in UN trade statistics, the value added of Hong Kong is re-defined as: <lb/>HK VA = Mark-up rate × min {UN country imports from China, China re-exports to UN country} <lb/>Note that the import statistics from China reported by the UN are at the 4-digit level of SITC. For <lb/>each country in the UN dataset, the value of imports from China is reduced by the calculated HK VA, while <lb/>the value of imports from Hong Kong is increased by the calculated HK VA. <lb/>The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 12 makes adjustments for re-exports for Hong Kong and <lb/>Netherlands in its GTAP 6 database. For Hong Kong, it also recognises that there is a re-export margin <lb/>included in re-exports which should be considered as value added by services and allocated accordingly. <lb/>11. <lb/>Such as the different valuations of exports and imports used by the US and China. Exports are measured by <lb/>China as free on board (f.o.b.) while for the US the valuation is freight alongside ship (f.a.s.) – the <lb/>difference being the cost of loading the goods from alongside the vessel or aircraft onto the vessel or <lb/>aircraft. For import measurement, both countries use cost, insurance, and freight (c.i.f.). Note that to <lb/>convert f.a.s. value to f.o.b. value, 1% cost is added to the f.a.s. exports value (see Fung and Lau, 2003). <lb/>12. <lb/>See www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=1819. Note that GTAP 7 (Nov <lb/>2008) is now available (www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v7/default.asp) but at the time of writing, <lb/>updated documentation concerning GTAP treatment of trade data was not yet available. <lb/></body>

			<body>Jin (2005) also provides an interesting discussion concentrating on &quot; processing trade &quot; and concludes: <lb/> &quot; Hong Kong&apos;s re-export of Chinese goods, in particular Chinese processing goods, is the major <lb/>reason for discrepancies in China&apos;s reported trade statistics with its major partners. The results <lb/>reflect changing economic reality rather than casting doubt on the quality of published trade data: <lb/>the real expansion of Chinese foreign trade in the last twenty years is due to the massive outsourcing <lb/>schemes of foreign invested enterprises into the low-margin processing sector in China. Despite the <lb/>decreasing trend in reliance on Hong Kong, the increasing scale of the processing trade means <lb/>large discrepancies will still exist in the future. &quot; <lb/>2.2.3. Re-exports – availability of data <lb/>Many countries, especially those using special trade systems, do not provide detailed information on <lb/>re-export statistics even though their exports figures routinely include re-exports. 13 As summarised in <lb/>Table 3, detailed re-exports data are currently only available in OECD ITCS and/or UN Comtrade for <lb/>New Zealand, the United States, Hong Kong, Russia and Singapore though not necessarily for all the years <lb/>covered by exports. <lb/>Re-exports data are available in the 2006 edition of OECD Input-Output database for most EU <lb/>countries (see Table 3 for exceptions), Canada, Norway, Chinese Taipei, South Africa, Switzerland and <lb/>Turkey. <lb/>Note that in the OECD ITCS and UN Comtrade databases, data are sometimes reported where the <lb/>declaring country and partner country are identical (for example: Australian imports from Australia or <lb/>French exports to France). Such information is more prevalent for import data. While some of these data <lb/>can be attributed to re-imports or re-exports of goods, according to the available country notes in ITCS, <lb/>this is not always the case – see latest documentation for OECD&apos;s Bilateral Trade Database (OECD, 2008) <lb/>for more details. <lb/>13. <lb/>See http://comtrade.un.org/kb/article.aspx?id=10152. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.3. Other data issues – an overview <lb/>When linking I-O tables we need to have trade-in-goods matrices that are consistent with countries&apos; <lb/>data for domestic production and intermediate consumption and thus adjustments for re-exports (and <lb/>re-imports) are an obvious priority. I-O analytical tools, especially inter-regional and multi-regional I-O <lb/>models that link production structures across countries, are increasingly being used to address a wide range <lb/>of socio-economic and environmental issues such as embodied carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions (Ahmad <lb/>and Wyckoff, 2003), international spatial organisation of the motor vehicle production (Wixted, 2006), and <lb/>material and environmental flows measurement (Wixted et al., 2006). If multinational I-O tables are not <lb/>well-constructed, subsequent analyses may be misleading. <lb/>Besides re-exports, there are other issues related to international trade-in-goods data, which should be <lb/>considered when linking I-O tables. These include: <lb/>•  &quot; Unallocated trade &quot; data: This is the trade that is not recorded in international databases under <lb/>regular (HS or SITC) product codes and/or not recorded by partner country, due to confidentiality <lb/>or other reasons. Such transactions may be recorded with special codes (e.g. HS 99 for products). <lb/> &quot; Unallocated trade &quot; as a share of total trade varies across countries and is often likely to be <lb/>concentrated in certain product groups or industries. The extent to which special codes are used <lb/>may even vary across time. In order to optimise trade data for linking input-output tables it would <lb/>be useful to have an idea of the underlying composition of any &quot; unallocated trade &quot; .<lb/>• Identification of trade in secondhand goods (e.g. transport equipment): These are not the result of <lb/>recent production and thus should not be linked to manufacturing production data for a given <lb/>year.<lb/>• Identification of certain scrap and waste products for recycling or disposal (e.g. PCs).<lb/>• Identification of exports from the recycling industry: For example, distinguishing exports of <lb/>recycled metals or paper from exports of similar products manufactured from raw materials.<lb/>• Consequences of &quot; merchanting &quot; : If a merchant in country A buys goods in country B and sells <lb/>them to country C, and the physical movement of goods is directly from B to C, then the value of <lb/>imports recorded by country C is usually greater than the value of exports recorded by country B <lb/>– the difference being recorded as a merchanting service credit in the Balance-of-Payments <lb/>account of country A. See Takeda (2006) for detailed discussion.<lb/>• Differences in trade structures when comparing, within countries, merchandise trade statistics <lb/>found in ITCS or Comtrade with those given in official Supply-Use or I-O tables even when <lb/>allowing for the differences in definitions used for BoP and customs-based trade statistics.<lb/>• Miscellaneous: For example, the significant impact of VAT intra-Community missing trader <lb/>fraud ( &quot; Carousel fraud &quot; ), as documented by the UK, affecting high-value low weight goods (such <lb/>as mobile phones). &quot; Official &quot; adjustments only made for total goods in a Balance of Payments <lb/>context – upward adjustments to imports of GBP 1.7 billion in 1999, GBP 2.8 billion <lb/>in <lb/>2000, <lb/>GBP 7.1 billion in 2001 and GBP 11.1 billion in 2002. <lb/>See <lb/>www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?id=402. Also, under-reporting of Canadian <lb/>exports <lb/>to <lb/>non-US <lb/>destinations <lb/>as <lb/>documented <lb/>by <lb/>Statistics <lb/>Canada: <lb/>www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2008doc.nsf/linkTo/std-ses-wptgs(2008)5.<lb/></body>

			<body>Also, for certain trade data sources, such as UN Comtrade and OECD ITCS, there may be differences <lb/>in reported trade statistics for certain countries, by partner country as well as at total level. <lb/>2.3.1. Difference of definitions in compiling trade statistics <lb/>Table 3 summarises the different trade definitions and valuations used by the countries targeted in <lb/>OECD I-O tables. Even though the UN has recommendations for defining trade partners of each country, <lb/>different countries still have different definitions on import and export partner countries. Most countries on <lb/>our list consider the country of origin as their import partner and the last known destination as their export <lb/>partner. However, there are still some exceptions. For example, New Zealand and Hong Kong take the <lb/>country of consignment as the import partner. Some countries apply a second rule of defining partner <lb/>countries if the first rule cannot be met. For example, the US takes the country of shipment as the import <lb/>partner if the country of origin cannot be identified. <lb/>Two different trade systems are commonly used – the General Trade System and the Special Trade <lb/>System. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its <lb/>economic territory, while a special trade system is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a <lb/>particular part of the economic territory (UN 1998). The general trade system is recommended by the UN <lb/>(1998) and used by most of the non-EU countries in our sample. In the EU, Special Trade is generally used, <lb/>the exceptions being Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. All European countries take countries of <lb/>consignment as export and import partners as far as intra-EU trade is concerned 14 . However, there are <lb/>exceptions. For example, Greece also takes the country of the first consignment as import partner country, <lb/>while Poland considers the countries of buyers as the import partner countries. <lb/>14. <lb/>According to Eurostat, there are ten countries that use the country of origin as a criterion for their national <lb/>figures, but provide data to Eurostat on a country-of-consignment basis for intra-community trade. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.3.2. Unallocated trade data <lb/>Unallocated trade refers to reported transactions not allocated to regular HS product codes, and/or not <lb/>allocated to a particular partner country, but reported using special codes (for example, HS 99 or <lb/> &quot; Commodities not specified according to kind &quot; for products; &quot; Other Areas n.e.s. &quot; for partners). The special <lb/>items cover confidential transactions as well as data that could not be allocated for other statistical reasons <lb/>(e.g. incomplete or ambiguous information on transactions). Such data cannot be ignored when linking the <lb/>trade data to I-O tables because unclassified goods in each country may be concentrated in certain <lb/>industries and/or related to certain partners. A maximum amount of information concerning the product, <lb/>and partner, composition of &quot; unallocated trade &quot; should be solicited from national authorities to make the <lb/>linkage of trade data to I-O tables more justified. On the other hand, if a country does not have unallocated <lb/>trade reported in databases it may be worth investigating whether the country really does not have <lb/>unallocated trade (confidential trade) or it is just not being reported. Note that GTAP also addresses this <lb/>issue when compiling GTAP database on the world economy as a system of flows of goods and services 15 . <lb/>Table 4 summarises the percentage of trade in products not specified, in HS according to kind. On <lb/>average, OECD countries have higher shares than non-OECD countries for both exports and imports. The <lb/>situation varies from country to country. Some countries such as Germany, Ireland, Russia, United <lb/>Kingdom and United States have relatively high shares of unallocated trade for both exports and imports, <lb/>while other countries have high shares in just exports or imports. For example, Norway has high <lb/>unallocated shares for exports compared to imports while Mexico has higher shares for imports. Note that <lb/>for certain countries such as Australia, Russia and South Africa, unallocated products can account for a <lb/>significant share of the total trade for certain years, sometimes for both exports and imports. <lb/>Of particular note are the variations of shares of unallocated trade for product across years within <lb/>countries. For example, in OECD&apos;s ITCS database, Australia has very high shares of exports not allocated <lb/>by product from 1990 to 2000 (14-19%) which drops to about 7% in 2005. Reasons for such variations can <lb/>include improvements in identifying transactions; changes in trading structures so that more or fewer <lb/>transactions in &quot; confidential trade &quot; are undertaken; or changes in the way such data are reported – from <lb/>providing data by partner but not by product to providing data by product but not by partner or vice versa. <lb/></body>

			<body>Table 5 summarises the percentage of trade not allocated by partner country (labelled &quot; Unspecified &quot; <lb/>in the OECD STAN Bilateral Trade by industry Database (BTD) and including &quot; Other areas n.e.s. &quot; , free <lb/>zones, fuel bunkers and special categories) for 41 countries in various years. As with unallocated products, <lb/>the shares vary across countries and across years within countries. Of particular note are the high and <lb/>increasing shares of imports from unspecified partners apparent for India and Israel. It should be noted that <lb/>for some countries a notable proportion of trade is reported with neither partner nor commodity. Also, the <lb/>share of trade allocated to recognised partners and commodities can be relatively low, even for OECD <lb/>countries – for example, for Australia, only 83% of exports are allocated to partner countries and HS <lb/>2-digit commodities in 2005. Care should thus be taken when using the apparent structure of such a subset <lb/>to determine the structure of total trade. <lb/>Table 6 details the sectoral shares of unspecified partners&apos; trade in total merchandise trade for an <lb/>aggregate of 41 OECD and non-OECD countries. In general, the &quot; energy-producing sectors &quot; (Mining and <lb/>quarrying, Coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel and Utilities) are the most commonly <lb/>reported without reference to partner countries. Close inspection reveals, however, that such practices are <lb/>concentrated in certain countries for certain sectors. For example, for Mining and Quarrying exports, the <lb/>shares are mainly explained by Russia where during 2000-2006, about 30% of exports were recorded <lb/>without a partner country – while for imports, the overall share is mainly due to the non-recording of <lb/>partners by Germany (30%) and India (49%). <lb/>A consequence of such variations in reporting &quot; confidential &quot; or &quot; unallocated &quot; trade is that if it affects <lb/>a small subset of products or partners, then any analyses of data over time for these products or partners <lb/>may be subject to biases – and it is often not easy to identify which products and/or partners are affected. <lb/>Table 6.

			<body>2.3.3. Scrap metal, waste products and secondhand goods <lb/>The increasing movement of scrap metal and assorted waste around the world is of obvious concern to <lb/>environmental analysts, particularly the increasing exports from developed to developing countries, so it is <lb/>important to be able to distinguish such products in international trade statistics. In a more general sense, <lb/>when linking trade in goods data to I-O tables, we need to be able to distinguish scrap metal, waste <lb/>products and secondhand goods from the output of recent manufacturing production and, for example, <lb/>identify imported inputs into the recycling industry. Currently, scrap metal and certain waste products <lb/>(e.g. paper and plastic) can be identified as they are coded in HS – see Table 7. However, there are many <lb/>types of used goods, such as discarded PCs and secondhand transport equipment that do not have separate <lb/>codes in HS and are thus difficult to identify in trade statistics – they may be &quot; recorded and classified <lb/>under the appropriate commodity heading if their value is positive &quot; . (The United Nations, 1998, para. 41) <lb/>Table 7. Waste and scrap metal products identified in trade data by HS code <lb/>HS 1988 Code <lb/>HS Description <lb/>Miscellaneous waste <lb/>3915 <lb/>Waste, parings and scrap, of plastics. <lb/>401220 <lb/>Used pneumatic tyres <lb/>4707 <lb/>Waste and scrap of paper or paperboard. <lb/>5103 <lb/>Waste of wool or of fine or coarse animal hair, including yarn waste but excluding garnetted stock. <lb/>5104 <lb/>Garnetted stock of wool or of fine or coarse animal hair. <lb/>5202 <lb/>Cotton waste (including yarn waste and garnetted stock). <lb/>5505 <lb/>Waste (including noils, yarn waste and garnetted stock) of man-made fibres. <lb/>Scrap metal <lb/>7112 <lb/>Waste and scrap of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal. <lb/>7204 <lb/>Ferrous waste and scrap; remelting scrap ingots of iron or steel. <lb/>7404 <lb/>Copper waste and scrap. <lb/>7503 <lb/>Nickel waste and scrap. <lb/>7602 <lb/>Aluminium waste and scrap. <lb/>7802 <lb/>Lead waste and scrap. <lb/>7902 <lb/>Zinc waste and scrap. <lb/>8002 <lb/>Tin waste and scrap. <lb/>8908 <lb/>Vessels and other floating structures for breaking up. <lb/>When looking at trade in identifiable scrap and waste (Table 8), it is no surprise that non-OECD <lb/>countries have higher and increasing import shares (e.g. China and India with about 1.8% each in 2005) <lb/>while OECD countries tend to have higher export shares (exceptions include Korea and Turkey). On <lb/>average, the import share for non-OECD countries was about 1% in 2005, double that for OECD, while for <lb/>exports, the OECD share was about 0.6%, double that for non-OECD countries. It is important to note that <lb/>for many countries, scrap and waste materials may be exported to (or imported from) a limited number of <lb/>trading partners so that while the share of such trade may be relatively low at total world level, it can be <lb/>quite significant when looking at certain bilateral trade flows. Trade in used goods not identified by HS (or <lb/>SITC) codes may follow similar patterns. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.3.4. Differences in published merchandise trade statistics <lb/>One source of frustration for researchers in recent years has been apparent differences in trade in <lb/>goods data from different published sources. While differences between OECD ITCS and Eurostat trade <lb/>data are to be expected, not least because of the latter&apos;s use of the Intrastat system, differences between <lb/>OECD ITCS and UN Comtrade are less intuitive since common definitions are generally applied. <lb/>Previously, OECD and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) developed their merchandise trade <lb/>statistics systems independently. However since 2001, via a &quot; Memorandum of Understanding &quot; , both <lb/>organisations have been sharing data sources 16 . The general idea behind the agreement is that trade data for <lb/>OECD member countries are processed by OECD while data for non-OECD countries are processed by <lb/>UNSD. While some reduction in the data reporting burden of OECD national statistical institutes has <lb/>occurred, the main aim of the exercise was the alignment and harmonisation of the UN and OECD trade <lb/>databases. Data for years beyond 2005 have been processed by OECD and UNSD with nearly identical <lb/>software systems and during 2008 increased efforts were made to &quot; harmonise &quot; ITCS with Comtrade by <lb/>reprocessing data for all OECD countries back to 2000 with the common software and procedures. <lb/>However, even when both databases have been &quot; synchronised &quot; there remain some subtle differences. <lb/>For example, ITCS has a more detailed treatment of &quot; unallocated trade &quot; (see 2.3.2, also known as <lb/> &quot; memoranda items &quot; ), for EU countries than UNSD – it hosts a range of special 6-digit product codes for <lb/> &quot; unallocated trade &quot; below the 2-digit HS level. A consequence is that for certain 2-digit product groups, <lb/>ITCS data may be higher than Comtrade while being lower for the general &quot; Commodities not specified <lb/>according to kind &quot; . This is illustrated in Table 9 by a comparison between ITCS and Comtrade 2-digit HS <lb/>data for Germany, where for example, exports of HS 88 &quot; Aircraft, spacecraft and parts thereof &quot; are <lb/>reported to be 5-7% higher in ITCS than in Comtrade. <lb/>Table 9.

There may be several reasons for this such as: i) use of different versions of national source <lb/>data: i.e. first version versus subsequent revision(s); ii) differing treatment of confidential data <lb/>(e.g. allocated to partner &quot; Other Areas n.e.s. &quot; versus allocated to &quot; Commodities n.e.s. &quot; ); and iii) differing <lb/>partner country and commodity coding regimes. Such problems mainly affect data for OECD countries. <lb/>This is because the OECD has only ever processed a few non-OECD countries such as China, Hong Kong <lb/>and Chinese Taipei (not recognised by the U.N.). Resources permitting, OECD hopes to extend the <lb/>synchronisation exercise to data prior to 2000. Reviewing data for 1995 would be particularly useful as this <lb/>was a common benchmark year for national I-O tables. <lb/>16. <lb/>For details concerning UNSD-OECD joint trade data collection and processing see Legoff, (2005, 2006). <lb/></body>

			<body>2.3.5. Bilateral trade by industry classifications <lb/>As well as the conceptual and statistical issues that affect the basic bilateral trade by commodity data, <lb/>such as re-exports and unallocated trade, there are additional challenges to be faced when attempting to <lb/>estimate trade flows by economic activity (whether producers of primary products, manufactures or <lb/>services). When linking industry x industry I-O tables for inter-country I-O analysis, matrices of bilateral <lb/>trade according to an industry classification are required, yet there are particular problems when <lb/>constructing such matrices. <lb/>For some years the OECD has produced the Bilateral Trade Database (BTD) for industrial analysis <lb/>which presents trade in goods according to economic activities, most recently using a classification based <lb/>on ISIC Rev.3. It is designed to be comparable with other data sets in OECD&apos;s &quot; STAN family &quot; including <lb/>OECD&apos;s I-O tables 17 . BTD is compiled from OECD&apos;s ITCS by using a standard conversion from the 1988 <lb/>version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS 1988) to ISIC Rev.3 for all <lb/>countries 18 . Data recorded in later versions of HS (HS 1996, HS 2002) are converted to HS 1988 <lb/>beforehand. The drawbacks of this standard approach include the following: <lb/>• BTD does not necessarily provide explicit trade figures for industry: products are linked to the <lb/>industries that typically produce them (and thus in this case, BTD assumes &quot; homogeneity &quot; in <lb/>industries). For industrial activity data, enterprises (or establishments) are allocated an ISIC code <lb/>according to their primary activity. If an industry has significant goods producing secondary <lb/>activities, its exports in BTD may be underestimated (and over-estimated in the industry deemed <lb/>likely to produce the goods).<lb/>• BTD presents estimates for all imports from partners&apos; industries, not intermediate imports by <lb/>domestic industries. While useful for developing indicators such as import penetration by <lb/>industry, this restricts the use of BTD imports for linking to imports of intermediates by industry <lb/>that are present in I-O tables.<lb/>• There are very few product codes allocated to service industries. However, industrial activity data <lb/>for some service sectors (e.g. wholesale and retail) may include enterprises involved in assembly <lb/>and export of final goods (e.g. PCs), considered as secondary activities. This is not recorded in <lb/>BTD (c.f. first bullet above).<lb/>• Exported output of recycling industry cannot be identified.<lb/>The consequences of some of the issues described above are illustrated in Table 10, which shows <lb/>exports as a percentage of production (gross output) for the ISIC Rev.3 activity &quot; Office, accounting and <lb/>computing machinery &quot; . For many countries the estimated value of exports is significantly greater than <lb/>production. While the main reason may be the presence of re-exports (particularly for Belgium and the <lb/>Netherlands), there are undoubtedly cases where wholesale firms are involved in the assembly and export <lb/>of PCs. Exports of used PCs to developing countries for re-use or dismantling may also be included, but <lb/>the value is probably quite low. In other words, in OECD countries, &quot; true &quot; manufacturing of PCs is not as <lb/>prevalent as exports data may suggest. <lb/>17. <lb/>BTD (OECD, 2008) was first developed by OECD&apos;s Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry in <lb/>the early 1990s as part of a project to provide data tools for &quot; advanced &quot; structural analysis such as the <lb/>measurement of international technology diffusion. Other data sets developed, and still maintained, include <lb/>the I-O database, STAN industry database (www.oecd.org/sti/stan) and the business R&amp;D expenditure <lb/>(ANBERD) database (www.oecd.org/sti/anberd). <lb/>18. <lb/>www.oecd.org/dataoecd/50/24/37990672.xls. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN SERVICES <lb/>3.1. Sources of data – Balance of Payments <lb/>International trade in services is defined as the supply of a service with four GATS modes of <lb/>provision: 1. Cross-border supply, 2. Consumption abroad, 3. Commercial presence and 4. Presence of <lb/>natural persons (United Nations, 2002, page 11; and page 23 for a graphical summary). The well <lb/>established Balance of Payments accounts cover the first two, as well as aspects of modes 3. and 4., and is <lb/>the principle source for estimates of bilateral trade in services. There is no equivalent of detailed customs <lb/>records for measuring international service transactions. <lb/>In the currently used recommendations of the 5 th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), <lb/>international service transactions are classified into a dozen or so major categories with some additional <lb/>detail (see IMF, 1993, page 43). More detailed information became available with the development and <lb/>introduction from 1996 of the Extended Balance of Payment Services (EBOPS) classification (United <lb/>Nations, 2002, pages 29-53). A concordance table is provided between EBOPS and the CPC Ver.1 <lb/>production classification (United Nations, 2002, Annex III). However, reconciling the EBOPS <lb/>classification with the activity classification used in harmonised industry x industry I-O tables is not <lb/>straightforward (Annex Table 1). For example, the subcategories of &quot; Travel &quot; (EBOPS236), &quot; Business <lb/>travel expenditure &quot; (EBOPS237) and &quot; Personal travel expenditure &quot; (EBOPS240), cover purchases from a <lb/>variety of service industries such as accommodation, restaurants and retail. <lb/>3.2. Availability of bilateral trade in services statistics <lb/>Despite substantial improvements in recent years, published bilateral trade in services data are still <lb/>quite limited compared to the availability of bilateral trade in goods. While most exports and imports <lb/>figures of commodity trade for all partners of our target of 40 or so countries are available, the number of <lb/>available figures of exports (credit) and imports (debit) are limited for services sectors. In the OECD Trade <lb/>in Services by partner countries database, 34 of our targeted reporter countries are currently covered, while <lb/>in UN Service Trade dataset, 29 reporter countries are covered. OECD Trade in Services provide as much <lb/>data as possible by different service categories among partner countries, while UN Service Trade only has <lb/>trade data on countries with the world as their partner. <lb/>Although the availability of data on bilateral trade in services is expanding steadily, there remain <lb/>conceptual differences between EBOPS and activity classifications such as ISIC Rev.3. One solution for <lb/>developing appropriate bilateral trade in service matrices for linking I-O tables is to exploit existing <lb/>bilateral trade in services data through use of non-survey modelling techniques such as gravity equations <lb/>(Kimura and Lee, 2006). <lb/>Differences not only exist for trade in goods, they also occur in trade in service statistics, for example <lb/>between UN and OECD trade in service databases. Encouragingly, notable differences in total trade in <lb/>services are observed for few countries (see Table 12). <lb/></body>

			<body>4. IMPENDING CHANGES TO BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFINITIONS <lb/>Two types of international transactions that will be recorded differently in the forthcoming revisions <lb/>to BoP recommendations, BPM6, and the System of National Accounts (SNA 1993 Rev.1), to be finalised <lb/>in 2009, are &quot; Goods sent abroad for processing &quot; and &quot; Merchanting &quot; . <lb/>4.1. Goods sent abroad for processing <lb/>Goods sent abroad for processing are defined as materials or semi-processed goods belonging to a unit <lb/>in country A which are shipped to a unit in country B for significant transformation and then either i) are <lb/>returned to the original unit in country A; ii) enter domestic economy of B; or iii) are exported to a third <lb/>country C. The goods do not change ownership from A to B and B receives a fee from A for processing the <lb/>goods. Minor transformations of goods, such as repair and packaging are not regarded as processing and <lb/>are excluded from this consideration. See Chapter 4 of United Nations (2008) for detailed discussion. <lb/>Under BPM5 and SNA 1993, &quot; goods for processing &quot; are recorded in both exports and imports of <lb/>goods as genuine external trade in gross terms although no change of ownership has taken place. This is <lb/>contrary to the basic principle of Balance of Payments that transactions should involve a change of <lb/>ownership. To rectify this, under the new recommendations, goods for processing will be excluded from <lb/>exports and imports in the goods accounts. Instead, the exchange of processing fees will be recorded under <lb/>services in the economies concerned: the outward processing economy recording payment of fees as <lb/>imports of services, the inward processing economy recording the receipt of fees as exports of services. <lb/>Thus there will be a mismatch with the physical movement of goods recorded in customs-based <lb/>merchandise trade statistics. <lb/>4.2. Merchanting <lb/>Merchanting is defined as the purchase of a good by a resident (of compiling economy A) from a <lb/>non-resident in country B and the subsequent resale of the good to another non-resident in country C. <lb/>During the process, the good does not enter or leave the compiling economy A. The difference between the <lb/>value of goods when acquired and the value when sold is recorded, under BPM5, as a merchanting service <lb/>credit in country A. Three categories of merchanting can be identified: &quot; Transactions accompanied by <lb/>global manufacturing &quot; , &quot; Global wholesaling &quot; and &quot; Commodity dealing &quot; (Takeda, 2006). Under BPM6, the <lb/>merchant&apos;s margin will be recorded in the goods account of economy A as a &quot; net export under <lb/>merchanting &quot; . Thus, as with goods for processing, there will be a mismatch with the physical movement of <lb/>goods recorded in customs-based merchandise trade statistics. <lb/>4.3. Impact of changes <lb/>In international merchandise trade statistics, goods for processing will continue to be recorded on a <lb/>gross basis (i.e. as exports for the processing country if returning goods to country of ownership), as will <lb/>the movement of goods under merchanting. Therefore, any approach adopted for adjusting/analysing <lb/>bilateral merchandise trade statistics will not necessarily have to change. However, when linking to <lb/>Supply-Use and I-O tables, there could be increased difficulties in reconciling the merchandise trade data <lb/>with SNA 1993 Rev.1 data since, for example, many transactions previously recorded as manufactured <lb/>goods in I-O tables will now be recorded as services. Given the time lags (2-3 years or more) involved in <lb/>implementing major changes to international standards, it is not expected that there will be a great impact <lb/>on harmonising and linking forthcoming 2005 (benchmark) I-O tables. However, when the time comes to <lb/>focus on 2010 I-O tables these issues will need to be addressed. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. SUMMARY <lb/>This paper highlights some issues that need to be taken into consideration when using bilateral trade <lb/>in goods statistics from existing international databases in order to construct multi-national I-O tables. For <lb/>researchers undertaking such work, the goal is to produce the best possible bilateral trade in goods and <lb/>services matrices that can be linked to the trade data present in harmonised I-O tables via, for example, a <lb/>multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model (as described in Box 1). Even if only analysing trade statistics, <lb/>the issues are worth taking into account. <lb/>In order to make the best possible use of existing trade statistics some short-term solutions could help <lb/>make necessary adjustments: <lb/>• Re-exports are of the most immediate concern due to their increasing shares in total trade <lb/>reported by many countries. Starting with countries with significant re-exports, national statistical <lb/>authorities could be requested to provide information on re-exports at the most detailed level <lb/>possible by partner and/or commodity for a few key years (e.g. 2000 and 2005). Some countries <lb/>have already carried out research concerning re-exports and their results could be exploited.<lb/>• For unallocated trade, national statistical authorities or research institutes with local knowledge <lb/>may be able to provide indications of the composition &quot; unallocated trade &quot; reported in OECD and <lb/>UNSD databases. Again, efforts should first be concentrated on the countries where the problem <lb/>is predominant.<lb/>• Identifying secondhand goods and assorted scrap and waste may be possible, under certain <lb/>circumstances, by exploiting quantity information and analysing average unit values of <lb/>transactions between countries.<lb/>• The most significant BoP adjustment concerns removing c.i.f. from total imports of goods and <lb/>allocating to services. For imports by commodity (or industry) c.i.f. adjustments could be made <lb/>on a pro rata basis, but it may be preferable for researchers to continue to benchmark bilateral <lb/>imports on the imports present in I-O tables with possible further adjustments for certain partner <lb/>countries based on distance matrices. In fact, understanding how national statisticians estimate <lb/>merchandise imports and exports by product (or industry) for integration into SUTs and I-O <lb/>tables could be beneficial. GTAP tackle this problem via bilateral estimates of transport margins <lb/>based on information from U.S. Census Bureau 19 .<lb/>• Close inspection of detailed HS categories in order to identify, where possible, products that are <lb/>likely to be intermediate goods rather than final consumption goods. For example, referring to <lb/>UN classification of Broad Economic Categories (BEC Rev.3) and/or concentrating on HS codes <lb/>for parts and components – cf. Yeats (1998) and use of SITC Rev.2 based list. A minimum <lb/>requirement when using I-O tables in conjunction with trade data is having consistent estimates <lb/>of the shares of imports of intermediate goods in total imports by industry.<lb/>19. <lb/>www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=1868. <lb/></body>

			<body>Long-term solutions to improve trade statistics databases could include: <lb/>• systematic reporting of re-exports for all countries;<lb/>• more detailed reporting of &quot; unallocated trade &quot; without breaking any confidentiality barriers;<lb/>• additional product codes (or other coding system) to identify secondhand goods and waste and <lb/>scrap not currently coded;<lb/>• additional product codes (or other coding system) to identify recycled goods;<lb/>• reporting of Balance of Payments trade in goods by commodity groups (i.e. adjustments below <lb/>the level of total goods);<lb/>• introduce export and import variables for goods and services in structural business statistics; and<lb/>• encourage more countries to produce (more) detailed bilateral trade in services data.<lb/>Whatever progress is made towards producing &quot; ideal &quot; bilateral trade matrices, researchers will still <lb/>need to build econometric models to fill the data shortage. However, this paper provides some insights as <lb/>why certain difficulties in matching trade and I-O may occur and so help researchers focus their efforts <lb/>when carrying out further data adjustments. Furthermore, the paper provides the groundwork for a possible <lb/>OECD project to develop improved bilateral trade matrices for use with I-O tables. <lb/></body>
