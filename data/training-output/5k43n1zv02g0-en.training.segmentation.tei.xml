			<front>QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE RETURNS OF INVESTMENT: <lb/>EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF COHESION EXPENDITURE IN EUROPEAN REGIONS <lb/>Andrés Rodriguez-Pose <lb/>Professor of Economic Geography at the London School of Economics <lb/>Enrique Garcilazo <lb/>Public Governance and Territorial Development Directorate, OECD <lb/>This paper sets out to examine the impact of the quality of local and regional governments on the <lb/>returns of investment, focusing on the returns of EU structural and cohesion funds.

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>There has been much debate in policy and scholarly circles investigating whether the quality of <lb/>institutions, in general, and the quality of government, in particular, affects the delivery and efficiency of public <lb/>investment. The growing agreement is that institutions and quality of government make an important difference <lb/>for the efficiency in the delivery of public policies and, consequently, for economic development (Amin and <lb/>Thrift, 1995; Amin, 1999; Hall and Jones, 1999; Acemoglu et al, 2001; Rodrik et al, 2004). Places with weak <lb/>and/or inefficient institutions suffer from a variety of problems which can range from pervasive corruption, rent-<lb/>seeking, insider-outsider problems, clientelism and nepotism to principal agent or impacted information <lb/>problems (Rodríguez-Pose and Storper, 2006). Different combinations of these problems lead to imperfectly <lb/>functioning markets and institutional and government failure, reducing, in turn, the capacity of governments to <lb/>adequately design and efficiently deliver public goods and policies. <lb/>The European Union (EU) has also adopted the view that poor institutions undermine the returns of public <lb/>investments. As stated in the EU &quot; s Fifth Cohesion Report, &quot; poor institutions can, in particular, hinder the <lb/>effectiveness of regional development strategies &quot; (EU, 2010: 65). The quality of local institutions is thus <lb/>considered to mediate the potential returns of investment in regional cohesion: the weaker the institutional <lb/>setting, the greater the problems in transforming European regional development investment into growth and <lb/>development. Regions with weak institutions have been considered as incapable of absorbing regional <lb/>development and cohesion funds and to make the most of the investments taking place in their territory. It <lb/>comes therefore is no surprise that, as early as 1997 in its draft Agenda 2000, the European Commission sought <lb/>to establish a ceiling of regional development expenditures, stating that in order &quot; to avoid major problems with <lb/>regard to absorption, the level of annual aid should increase gradually, subject to the general limit of 4% of <lb/>national GDP, which would apply to the structural funds and the cohesion fund together &quot; (EU, 1997, page 25). <lb/>Yet, despite the growing interest on institutional factors, the empirical literature on how the quality of <lb/>government impinges on the returns of European public policies and public investments at a regional level is <lb/>still in its infancy. While in development economics there has been a growing body of literature linking, for <lb/>example, the institutions associated to colonial origins and economic outcomes (e.g. Acemoglu et al. 2001), <lb/>there is still relatively little evidence about whether and how the quality of government has shaped the efficient <lb/>implementation of public policies and the use of public investment at regional level. We know even less about <lb/>the mechanisms at play in the interaction between regional political institutions – beyond social capital <lb/>(Beugelsdijk and van Schaik, 2005a and 2005b) and culture (e.g. Tabellini, 2010) – and economic development. <lb/>At the EU level there is to our knowledge no clear-cut evidence that the quality of government of the different <lb/>regions affects the returns of European cohesion support and no proof that poor quality of government limits the <lb/>absorptive capacity of European funds. There is also little evidence, beyond the work of Becker et al. (2012), <lb/>that the returns of European cohesion efforts decline as cohesion investment increases and none that they <lb/>diminish when regional transfers exceed a threshold of 4% of GDP. <lb/>In this paper we combine data on the investment undertaken by the EU in cohesion and structural policies <lb/>targeting regions, with data on the quality of government gathered by the Quality of Government Institute at the <lb/>University of Gothenburg. This allows us to assess whether different local combinations taking into account the <lb/>rule of law, the control of corruption, government effectiveness, and voice and accountability affect the returns <lb/>of European structural and cohesion fund investments across the regions of the EU during the period between <lb/>1996 and 2007. In particular, we are interested in whether and how the quality of government in any given <lb/>European region mediates the returns of European investments and whether these effects are larger or smaller <lb/>beyond a given threshold of cohesion investment. <lb/>The results indicate that, although at first sight the quality of government does not seem to affect the <lb/>returns of European investment across the whole sample of regions considered, it does play a major role in <lb/>determining whether the cohesion effort is connected to greater growth in those regions receiving the greatest <lb/>amount of funds. For those regions receiving on average more than 80 euros of cohesion expenditure per capita <lb/>per year, the quality of government is a basic determinant of whether greater cohesion investment is translated <lb/>into greater growth. The importance of the quality of government increases significantly as the level of cohesion <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>expenditure rises. In addition, our analysis using interaction terms, finds that for regions receiving a <lb/>considerable amount of funds and sharing a similar level of quality of government, greater expenditure does not <lb/>necessarily translate into greater economic growth, unless the quality of government is improved. <lb/>2. Institutions, quality of government and economic development <lb/>Across all areas of the social sciences there is a growing scholarly consensus that institutions matter for <lb/>economic development. Economic sociologists (Tönnies, 1887; Weber, 1921; Granovetter, 1973; Coleman, <lb/>1988) have for now more than a century been stressing the importance of institutions for the effectiveness of <lb/>public policy and economic development. Different types of institutions not only create the rules of the game by <lb/>which economic activities are governed, but also de facto shape the incentives and disincentives driving <lb/>economic interactions, making them essential determinants for the economic outcomes in any given territory. <lb/>The baton laid by economic sociologists has been taken over in recent decades by a raft of other social <lb/>scientists. Geographers (Amin and Thrift, 1994; Amin, 1999), political scientists (Putnam, 1993, 2000) and <lb/>economists (North, 1990; Acemoglu et al., 2001; Rodrik et al., 2004) have of late delved into how institutions <lb/>shape and determine economic development, indicating that long-term economic outcomes tend frequently to <lb/>be the result of institutional conditions more than of alternative economic factors (Rodrik et al., 2004). <lb/>One essential form of political institution is that related to the quality of government. Government, in <lb/>general, and local and regional governments, in particular, are the key organisations determining the rules of the <lb/>game at the local level. The quality of local governments is therefore likely to affect the efficiency and the <lb/>returns of any type of public investment. Accountable and transparent governments, staffed by well-trained civil <lb/>servants and led by trustworthy politicians who have the interests of the local community at heart will, in all <lb/>likelihood, design and implement policies and public goods which benefit the whole community and result in <lb/>inclusive sustainable development. Unaccountable governments, poorly staffed and with inept and/or corrupt <lb/>politicians at the helm will, by contrast, deliver inefficient policies or, worse still, lead to situations where rent-<lb/>seeking and insider-outsider problems become the norm. <lb/>The views that institutions matter and that the quality of local governments affects the effectiveness and <lb/>returns of public policies has been assimilated by the EU in the application of its regional cohesion policy. This <lb/>is important because, although all member states of the EU should have adopted the so-called, Acquis <lb/>Communautaire 1 or the accumulated legislation and court decisions of the EU, it is plainly evident that the <lb/>functioning of these formal institutions varies considerably from country to country and even within countries. <lb/>This is because, as underlined by Vachudova (2009), especially in the case of former transition countries which <lb/>have joined the EU since 2004, the requirements to improve the transparency and efficiency of state institutions <lb/>have been adopted, rather than enforced. This leads to still considerable differences across the EU in the quality <lb/>of formal institutions and, in particular, in those of informal institutions, with corruption and clientelism still <lb/>representing major obstacles for the full establishment of the rule of law in many areas of the former transition <lb/>countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Guasti and Dobovsek, 2011). Hence, across parts of Europe we find <lb/>different combinations of corruption, pervasive rent-seeking, self-serving decision-makers, and low quality of <lb/>bureaucracy – all indicators of the presence of weak governmental institutions and a low quality of government <lb/>– which are likely to hurt the effectiveness of all types of public policies and, in the case of the EU cohesion <lb/>effort, may undermine the assimilation of funds and affect the potential returns of EU expenditure in structural <lb/>and cohesion funds. Furthermore, the quality of government at the local level is a key element in multilevel <lb/>forms of government for coordinating actions across tiers of government, aligning policy objectives, enhancing <lb/>the delivery of goods and services, and ensuring the local needs are represented and taken into account in the <lb/>policy design across the different layers. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1. <lb/>From an institutional perspective and following the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership, the Acquis <lb/>Communautaire implies democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of <lb/>minorities, and a functioning market economy. <lb/></note>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>From this perspective, the lower the quality of government, the lower the capacity to absorb development <lb/>funds, and the lower the efficiency and returns of public investments. This sort of reasoning is at the heart of the <lb/>4% of GDP expenditure limit proposed in the Agenda 2000: if institutions and the quality of government of any <lb/>given European region are deficient, more expenditure on development would not lead to the expected results, <lb/>unless the institutional conditions which limit the effectiveness of expenditure are not improved. <lb/>3. Measuring the quality of government <lb/>Linking government quality to the returns of public policies is difficult and there is little empirical <lb/>evidence so far that establishes such a nexus. Perhaps the main problem in this respect is that of defining and <lb/>measuring the quality of government. Government quality is an elusive concept. It may mean different things to <lb/>different people and it is likely to be affected by myriad of factors. Notwithstanding this, the number of studies <lb/>and indices which have looked at issues of quality of government and governance at national level has not <lb/>ceased to grow (e.g. Kaufman et al., 2009). However, subnational regions, cities and localities remain – despite <lb/>the perception of wide internal variations in quality of government within countries – virtually uncharted <lb/>territories. Some studies have ventured more in depth into how the quality of governmental institutions affects <lb/>economic performance in different parts of the country. This type of analysis been very prevalent for the case of <lb/>Italy, where a large number of local Meridionalisti (e.g. Trigilia, 1992; Diamanti et al., 1995; Bodo and Viesti, <lb/>1997) and many foreign scholars (e.g. Putnam, 1993) have delved for the roots of the differences in <lb/>development between the North and the South of the country, among other factors, in the variation in the <lb/>efficiency of local governments between diverse parts of Italy. But analyses covering subnational entities <lb/>beyond the borders of the nation-states are conspicuously absent. <lb/>This lack of comparable data on the quality of government across national borders for Europe has recently <lb/>been addressed by a report by the Quality of Government Institute of the University of Gothenburg (Quality of <lb/>Government Institute, 2010). This study resorts to survey data from 34,000 respondents, living in 172 NUTS1 <lb/>and NUTS2 regions (NUTS2 is largely equivalent to the OECD &quot; s Territorial Level 2) 2 in 18 EU states 3 in order <lb/>to measure the perception of the quality of regional and local governments across Europe. In the report, <lb/>following Rothstein and Teorell (2008), the quality of government is assimilated to the concept of impartial <lb/>government institutions, that is &quot; when public officials who implement policies do not take anything about the <lb/>citizen/case into consideration that is not beforehand stipulated in the policy or the law &quot; (Quality of Government <lb/>Institute, 2010, page 9). In order to operationalise this concept, the Quality of Government Institute resorts to <lb/>decomposing the idea of quality of government into four components: a) rule of law; b) corruption; c) quality of <lb/>the bureaucracy or bureaucratic effectiveness; and d) democracy and the strength of electoral institutions <lb/>(Quality of Government Institute, 2010, page 21). <lb/>Thirty-four questions regarding all these four components were included in a survey which – after the <lb/>thematic and geographical aggregation of the different answers by the 34,000 respondents – resulted in the <lb/>formation of a regional-level quality of government index and to the first mapping of regional government <lb/>quality across regions of the EU in the year 2009 (Figure 1). <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1 reveals the presence of a West/East and, to a much lesser extent, North/South divide in the <lb/>subnational quality of government in Europe. Regions in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands rank <lb/>among those with the best quality of government in Europe, as do Scotland and the East Midlands in the <lb/>UK. Among the regions in the South, Trentino-Alto Adige and Valle d &quot; Aosta are also amongst the best <lb/>performers. Some Spanish regions, such as Asturias, the Basque Country, Extremadura or Galicia also <lb/>score highly in the index, as is the case of Friuli-Venezia Giulia in Italy. The worst scores are found in the <lb/>South East of Europe. Bulgarian, Greek and Slovakian regions have, according to the results of the survey, <lb/>the worst quality of government. Some southern Italian regions, such as Calabria and Campania, are also <lb/>perceived to be in the same category. <lb/>Internal contrasts are visible in a number of countries. This is more evident in countries with an <lb/>overall low subnational quality of government (Slovakia being the main exception). Italy represents the <lb/>most extreme case. While some northern regions have levels of quality of government matching those of <lb/>Scandinavian countries or the Netherlands, there is very little difference in the perception of the quality of <lb/>government between regions in the South of the country and those of Bulgaria or Romania. In Romania <lb/>some regions in the west of the country – Nord Vest and Centru – perform relatively well, whereas the <lb/>quality of government for Bucharest is regarded to be well below the national mean. Strong internal <lb/>variation can also be observed in Belgium, Bulgaria, Portugal, or Spain. <lb/>The data provided by the Quality of Government Institute are only available for a single year (2009). <lb/>Following Charron et al. (2012), we interpolate values across a longer time period by combining the data <lb/>with the World Bank &quot; s World Governance Indicators, available at the national level. The assumption is that <lb/>regional variations within countries are relatively stable; and variations at the national level are captured by <lb/>the World Bank World Indicators. Details on how this indicator is calculated can be found in Charron et al. <lb/>(2012). The combined interpolated data for 2009 is presented in Figure 2. It displays a picture of quality of <lb/>government in Europe which is strongly associated to the levels of socio-economic development and social <lb/>trust of the regions of the EU, but uncorrelated to other factors, such as population and area size (Charron <lb/>et al., 2012). The strong West/East divide in quality of government of Figure 1 is maintained, but the <lb/>North/South divide becomes even more pronounced (figure 2). The introduction of the World Bank Global <lb/>Governance indicators in the resulting regional index drags down the scores for the quality of government <lb/>fundamentally in Romanian, Italian and Spanish regions, while the highest scores remain concentrated in <lb/>Scandinavia, West and North Netherlands, Scotland, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia, and Burgenland. <lb/>Slovakian regions, by contrast, no longer rank amongst those with the lowest quality of government in <lb/>Europe. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Model and data <lb/>Given that &quot; good governance is a necessary requirement for countries to foster economic <lb/>development &quot; (Quality of Government Institute, 2010, page 19) and government quality determines the <lb/>capacity to transform investment into economic activity and development, this implies that the quality of <lb/>government mediates the returns of public policy. <lb/>Our analysis explores whether this is the case in Europe: do the economic returns of structural funds <lb/>and cohesion investment in Europe depend on the quality of government of the regions where the <lb/>investment takes place? Our aim is to assess the extent to which the quality of local or regional <lb/>governments might mitigate or enhance the effects of structural and cohesion fund investment on regional <lb/>economic performance. <lb/>Model specification <lb/>Our econometric model uses panel data and aims to assess the returns of European investment in <lb/>economic and social cohesion at a regional level and, more specifically, to determine whether these returns <lb/>are affected by the quality of the government of the regions receiving funds, while controlling for a series <lb/>of regional factors deemed to affect economic performance. In this interactive model, the growth of GDP <lb/>per capita across regions in Europe between 1996 and 2007 is specified by the following equation: <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>QGov <lb/>Cohesion <lb/>QGov <lb/>Cohesion <lb/>y <lb/>y <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>φX <lb/>* <lb/>(1) <lb/>Where: <lb/>Δy is the average annual growth of real GDP per capita of region i over the period 1996-2005; <lb/>y i is the GDP per capita in the previous period in region i; <lb/>Cohesion is our main independent variable of interest and represents the per capita investments <lb/>undertaken by the European Union in region i under the structural and cohesion policy <lb/>framework; <lb/>QGov is our moderator, proxied by the composite indicator of the quality of government in any <lb/>given European region collected by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of <lb/>Gothenburg; <lb/>Cohesion*QGov is the interaction term between the previous two variables; <lb/>X denotes a vector of variables controlling for other factors assumed to influence growth, <lb/>including the level of education and training of the adult population of the region, measures of <lb/>infrastructure endowment, levels of employment, and agglomeration effects and finally <lb/>υ is the corresponding disturbance term. <lb/>Our main interest lies in the coefficients δ, ϕ, and γ, which intend to capture the connection between <lb/>the level of investments of the EU on regional cohesion, the quality of regional and local governments, and <lb/>the interaction of both terms, respectively, with economic growth. <lb/></body>

The main independent variable of interest is structural <lb/>fund and cohesion investments undertaken by the European Union targeting NUTS2 regions. Quality of <lb/>government is our moderating variable and we control for the interaction between cohesion investments <lb/>and quality of government. <lb/>The public investments financed by the European Union (CohesionExp) are measured over the period <lb/>between 1996 and 2007, and represent the actual payments – rather than the commitments, as in a number <lb/>of prior studies on the impact of structural and cohesion funds – to European regions. Unfortunately, these <lb/>data do not cover public investments financed by regions and by national governments. Such data exist <lb/>only for a very limited number of countries. The variable thus represents a fraction of all public <lb/>investment, and a highly variable fraction at that, as there are large differences in the degree to which <lb/>regions draw on EU financing. These differences are explicitly addressed in some of the models below. <lb/>The quality of institutions is proxied by the use of a quality of government (QualGov) composite <lb/>index. As indicated earlier, this index is constructed for 172 European regions by the Quality of <lb/>Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg (see QGI, 2010, for full details of its construction). <lb/>The measure is a composite indicator of government quality based on survey data of public perceptions of <lb/>four components of governance. These components include (1) the rule of law, (2) corruption (3) the <lb/>quality of the bureaucracy and (4) democracy and the strength of electoral institutions. The main problem <lb/>with this indicator is that it was collected in 2009/2010 and only for that year. This implies that there are no <lb/>time series of quality of government data at the regional level, making it problematic to introduce this <lb/>indicator in a panel data analysis. We are therefore left with an option which includes a rather strong <lb/>assumption. <lb/>The option used in order to circumvent the problem of lack of time series in quality of government <lb/>data across European regions is to assume that the quality of government detected in every region in 2009 <lb/>has evolved in a similar way as changes in governance at the national level over time. We therefore follow <lb/>Charron et al. (2012) and interpolate the quality of government composite index with a national <lb/>governance variable extracted from the World Bank Governance Data. The components included in the <lb/>World Bank national governance indicators encompass (1) rule of law (2) governance effectiveness (3) <lb/>control of corruption (4) voice and accountability. Mixing both indices gives us a regional indicator of <lb/>quality of government which varies for the whole period of analysis. This means that we are using the <lb/>Quality of Government Institute &quot; s (2010) combined with the quality of government index (see Figure 2) as <lb/>an independent variable, rather than the regional quality of government index (Figure 1). <lb/>Our third key independent variable of interest is the interaction term for public investment and the <lb/>quality of government (CohesionExp*QualGov). The introduction of this interaction represents an effort to <lb/>discern to what extent, if any, the impact of public investments depends on quality of government. <lb/></body>

			<body>In addition, a number of control variables which, according to the theoretical and empirical literature, <lb/>may affect regional economic performance in Europe are also included in the analysis. Data for the control <lb/>variables are taken from the OECD Regional Database. The key control variables are: <lb/>InfrasDen: Infrastructure density defined by motorway kilometres by population; <lb/>Education: The percentage of adults having either only completed primary school (Primary <lb/>Education) or with a university degree (Tertiary Education) represent our proxies of the level of <lb/>human capital of the workforce. <lb/>Emp Rate: The rate of employment in the region; <lb/>Density: Employment density (Emp Density) and population density (Pop Density) capture <lb/>agglomeration effects and are measured as employment per square kilometres and population per <lb/>square kilometres, respectively <lb/>GDP t-1 is the previous level of GDP per capita. <lb/>Our model specification considers a two-way fixed effect panel regression model, with <lb/>heteroskedasticity robust estimators and country (C) and time (T) controls. Our sample of regions totals <lb/>169 (three regions had to be dropped from the analysis) in 18 different countries in the European Union. <lb/>Most data are gathered – following the territorial division used in order to compile the Quality of <lb/>Government indicator – at NUTS2 level, with the exception of data for Belgium, Germany, Greece, the <lb/>Netherlands and the UK, which refers to NUTS1 regions. The time period covered in the analysis is limited <lb/>to the years between 1996 and 2007, due to the lack of availability World Bank Global Governance <lb/>Indicators before 1996. <lb/>5. Results of the analysis <lb/>As mentioned earlier, the analysis is conducted – in order to take advantage of the panel dimension of <lb/>the data – following the assumption that the quality of government in every EU region has evolved in a <lb/>similar way to changes in the quality of governance at the national level. By interpolating the quality of <lb/>government regional index with a national governance variable extracted from the World Bank <lb/>Governance Data, we achieve a continuous variable of quality of government (QualGov) which can be <lb/>used both as a moderator of the returns of cohesion investment and main effect, and as one of the two <lb/>components of the interaction. <lb/>Using these variables, we are capable of examining the link between investments in EU cohesion <lb/>policy (Table 1, model 1) and quality of government (Table 1, model 2), on the one hand, and economic <lb/>growth, on the other, separately; of both factors together (Table 1, model 3); and of both main components <lb/>with their interaction (Table 1, model 4) <lb/>The empirical model is estimated first including all regions considered in the analysis, regardless of <lb/>the level of expenditure in each of the regions by the EU (Table 1). This analysis provides evidence that <lb/>EU-financed public investment has had a positive and statistically significant link with regional growth, <lb/>regardless of the quality of local and regional government. The coefficient of the average expenditure per <lb/>head per region in cohesion funds is always positive and significant, whereas that referring to the quality of <lb/>government remains statistically insignificant (with the exception of model 3), despite having a positive <lb/>sign. The interaction between cohesion investments by the EU and the quality of government is also <lb/>insignificant, pointing to the possibility that the investment efforts by the EU may work regardless of the <lb/>quality of the government of the region where the expenditure takes place. <lb/></body>

Hence, the presence of a large number of regions that are relatively well-off, where EU intervention <lb/>in order to achieve greater cohesion is very limited, and where the overwhelming majority of public <lb/>expenditure is bound to come from local, regional and national sources, rather than from the EU, may bias <lb/>the results. EU structural fund and cohesion intervention in most of these regions would be insufficient to <lb/>make any real difference in economic performance. <lb/>As can be seen in Figure 3, EU-financed public investment varies widely across regions and this <lb/>variation is decidedly non-linear.

These regions include the so-called &quot; convergence &quot; regions – <lb/>formerly known as &quot; Objective 1 &quot; regions – which, by definition, are considerably poorer and, in general, <lb/>also tend to have greater government quality problems. These regions are, moreover, concentrated in <lb/>specific parts of Europe – mainly in central and eastern and southern Europe – which, as we saw in Figures <lb/>1 and 2, are precisely those with the lowest levels of quality of government. Consequently, there is some <lb/>reason to believe that there may be a good deal of covariation in the expenditure and government quality <lb/>variables – that is, highly supported regions tend to be more prevalent in countries where the quality of <lb/>government scores are lower. <lb/>Figure 3. Distribution of EU funds per capita: Kernel density estimate <lb/>Given the very unequal distribution of cohesion funds across the regions of the EU, we assume that <lb/>quality of government may only make a real difference in the impact of European cohesion expenditure in <lb/>those regions which received a considerable amount of funding per head per year.

These thresholds are established at 80, 100, 120 and 150 euros of regional expenditure per <lb/>capita, allowing us to discriminate between the effects of public investment and quality of government on <lb/>regional performance on regions benefiting from different levels of public intervention.

			<body> When both factors are considered together (Table 2, model 3), the coefficient for quality of <lb/>government remains positive and significant while that for cohesion expenditure is still <lb/>insignificant. <lb/> The introduction of both factors together with their interaction in Table 2, model 4, makes the <lb/>coefficient of all three variables significant, although quality of government remains by far the <lb/>most significant of the three variables.

			<body>The application of the different thresholds corroborates the results of the regressions for the more than <lb/>100 euros threshold reported in Table 2: <lb/> Above an expenditure threshold of 80 euros per head per annum, the coefficient for the cohesion <lb/>expenditure variable is always very close to 0 and keeps on losing significance as the threshold <lb/>increases. <lb/> For those regions receiving more than 150 euros per person additional investments in structural <lb/>and cohesion funds becomes totally dissociated from greater economic growth (Table 3, model <lb/>5). <lb/>Hence, the positive and significant association between this variable and economic growth reported in <lb/>Table 1 (and also in Table 3, model 1) gradually evaporates, leading to a much stronger and significant <lb/>connection between government quality and regional economic performance. Indeed, at relatively high <lb/>levels of cohesion expenditure per capita, the quality of local or regional government always dominates the <lb/>level of expenditure per head as the key predictor of the returns of cohesion investment. Beyond 80 euros <lb/>of expenditure in regional development per capita per annum, the coefficient for quality of government is <lb/>always highly positive and significant. And this relationship becomes progressively reinforced as the <lb/>threshold of expenditure is increased (Table 3, models 2 to 5). The association between quality of <lb/>government and regional economic performance is considerably stronger when the threshold of <lb/>expenditure is above 120 euros per head per annum in any given region than when the threshold is limited <lb/>to 80 euros. It is strongest for those regions receiving more than 150 euros per inhabitant per year. <lb/>The introduction of the interaction between public investment and quality of government (Table 3) <lb/>further reinforces the importance of the quality of government variable in determining the returns of <lb/>cohesion expenditure. As seen in Table 2 and reproduced in all regressions for Table 3 – with the exception <lb/>of when the no expenditure threshold is applied (model 1) – the introduction of the interaction term not <lb/>only reinforces the positive and significant coefficients associated to the quality of government variable, <lb/>but also renders the cohesion investment variable positive and significant, with the only exception of the <lb/>regression where the threshold is set at 150 euros. <lb/>However and against expectations, the coefficient of the interaction term between cohesion <lb/>investment and quality of government above the 80 euro per head investment threshold is always negative <lb/>and significant, and very close to 0 (Tables 4, models 2 to 5). <lb/>In order to correctly interpret the interaction between regional government quality and EU <lb/>investments in cohesion and structural policies, we plot in Figure 4 the two-way interaction effects for the <lb/>unstandardized variables using the procedures of Aiken and West (1991) and Dawson and Richter (2006). 4 <lb/>4. <lb/>The webpage www.jeremydawson.co.uk/slopes.htm contains various Excel worksheets which help interpret <lb/>the interaction effects. <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>Figure 4. Two-way interaction effect for quality of government and cohesion expenditure <lb/>Note: unstandardized values <lb/>Figure 4 plots the returns of EU investments (low-and high-cohesion expenditure in the x-axis) in <lb/>terms of economic growth per capita (y-axis), taking into account the quality of government at the different <lb/>thresholds of cohesion expenditure considered in the analysis. Several conclusions can be extracted from <lb/>this Figure. <lb/>First of all, it is evident that the returns of European investment in regional cohesion increase as the <lb/>threshold of investment per capita per annum increases. The returns are higher at a 100 euro threshold than <lb/>at an 80 euro threshold. In turn, regions which receive more than 120 euros of structural and cohesion fund <lb/>expenditure per annum do better in growth terms than those getting a minimum of 100 euros. However, the <lb/>increase seems to stop at 120 euros, as there is virtually no difference between the returns experienced by <lb/>regions receiving more than 120 euros and those receiving more than 150 (please note that the two lines for <lb/>low quality of government for expenditure thresholds of 120 and 150 euros overlap). In this respect, our <lb/>results confirm that poor quality of government may be at the root of what Becker et al. (2012) describe as <lb/>declining returns of regional development funds in Europe as the transfer intensity increases. These <lb/>authors, using a radically different method, reach the conclusion that in a considerable number of European <lb/>regions the transfer intensity of European regional funds exceeds what can be considered the efficiency <lb/>maximising level. They even highlight that, in some cases, a reduction of transfers would not affect <lb/>regional economic performance (Becker et al. 2012). <lb/>Second, in all categories considered, regions with a higher quality of government perform <lb/>significantly better at the same level of cohesion expenditure than those with a lower quality of <lb/>government. <lb/>Third, although increasing cohesion investment helps reduce the gap in the economic returns <lb/>experienced by high quality government and low quality government regions, this reduction is marginal <lb/>and does not suffice to overcome the quality of government gap which is the main explanation behind the <lb/>difference in the returns from cohesion expenditure of regions benefiting from a similar level of European <lb/>regional cohesion support. <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>To give a more precise idea of the dimension by which differences in quality of government trump the <lb/>potential effects of additional cohesion investment on regional growth, we have performed some <lb/>calculations based on Figure 4. The results indicate that above a certain threshold of cohesion expenditure <lb/>per capita, investing more in cohesion expenditure has positive, but very limited returns on the growth of <lb/>GDP per head. At levels of more than 80 euros in cohesion expenditure per head per annum, increasing the <lb/>amount of cohesion funds by one standard deviation in a region with a low quality of government yields an <lb/>added growth of a mere 1.9% above what would have been achieved had that additional investment not <lb/>taken place. The positive influence of any further cohesion investment declines as the investment threshold <lb/>rises: the additional impact on growth is of 1.7% above 100 euros of expenditure; 1.6% above 120; and <lb/>1.5% above 150. By contrast, increasing the quality of government by that same standard deviation would <lb/>lead to significantly higher rises in growth. The additional impact of improving the quality of government <lb/>hovers just below 7% across all categories, with the exception of the 120 euro threshold (5.6%). The <lb/>positive impact of improvements in quality of government is somewhat lower for those regions which <lb/>benefit from levels of support which are considerably higher than the pre-established threshold. Yet, even <lb/>in those cases, improving the quality of government would yield greater returns than continuing to increase <lb/>cohesion expenditure. The additional effect of improving quality of government by one standard deviation <lb/>in these cases ranges between a minimum of 2.9% additional growth (above 120 euros) and a maximum of <lb/>3.9% (above 100 euros). <lb/>6. Conclusions <lb/>In this paper we have analysed the extent to which the returns of European regional development and <lb/>cohesion investment across the whole of Europe are affected by the quality of the government of the <lb/>regions receiving the funds. The capital role played by government quality on the returns of public policy <lb/>has been strongly posited by the literature dealing with the economic implications of institutions. It has <lb/>also been indirectly presumed by the EU in its structural and cohesion policy by the mere fact of having <lb/>discussed a cap on the amount of resources which could be channelled to specific regions on the basis of <lb/>their capacity to absorb and adequately use funds. However, to date there has been no empirical <lb/>demonstration that quality of government is a strong mediator of the returns of European cohesion <lb/>investment and that regions with lower quality governments experience greater difficulties in transforming <lb/>structural and cohesion funds into greater economic growth and development. <lb/>Using the quality of government index of the Quality of Government Institute at the University of <lb/>Gothenburg (Quality of Government Institute, 2010) and complementing it with the World Bank Global <lb/>Governance indicators, the results of our panel data analysis for the period between 1996 and 2007 <lb/>demonstrate that, although at first sight quality of government does not appear to affect the returns of <lb/>European investments for all the regions in Europe, its effect as a moderator kicks in above a certain <lb/>threshold of expenditure. When a region receives a level of investment in cohesion and regional <lb/>development which can be considered more than testimonial, the quality of the local government becomes <lb/>a vital factor in determining the extent to which the regional development investment is transferred into <lb/>economic growth. This is clearly evident for regions where structural and cohesion funds represent more <lb/>than 80 euros per head per year. In these regions the importance of quality of government, both as a factor <lb/>for economic growth on its own and as a mediator for an efficient use of structural cohesion funds, <lb/>increases as the expenditure threshold rises. Beyond levels of cohesion expenditure which exceed 120 <lb/>euros per person and per year the most efficient way to increase the returns of the European effort on <lb/>territorial cohesion is best done by an improvement of the quality of government of any given region. <lb/>Pouring more funds into the region will simply not do the trick. <lb/>Hence, it can be said that both EU investments targeting regions and quality of government make a <lb/>difference for regional economic growth, but above a certain threshold of expenditure (which our analysis <lb/>establishes at levels of cohesion expenditure of around 120 euros per person per annum), the quality of <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>government becomes the basic factor determining the returns of public investments. In many of the regions <lb/>receiving the bulk of structural funds, greater levels of cohesion expenditure would, in the best case <lb/>scenario, only lead to a marginal improvement in economic growth, unless the quality of the government is <lb/>significantly improved. <lb/>Overall, our analysis has contributed to the rapidly expanding literature on how institutions shape <lb/>economic performance and the returns of economic policy at a regional level in Europe (Rodríguez-Pose, <lb/>2013). As in the case of Beugelsdijk and van Schaik (2005a, 2005b) and Tabellini (2010), it demonstrates <lb/>how regional institutions in Europe are key shapers of economic performance. In particular, in has shown <lb/>that, in the case of European cohesion investment aiming at the development of regions, there are no <lb/>shortcuts: the returns to investment do not come necessarily from the degree of investment itself, but from <lb/>the quality of government of the region receiving the support. Improvements in the quality of government <lb/>are thus likely to lead to greater returns to public investment. In addition, the need to address quality of <lb/>government bottlenecks in order to maximise the returns of cohesion investment becomes all too evident <lb/>the greater the level of investment. In these regions, simply throwing greater amount of funds at areas with <lb/>inefficient and/or corrupt governments will lead to waste, unless the quality of government is seriously <lb/>improved. <lb/>Our findings give thus support to the broad thrust of recent EU Cohesion Policy changes, aimed at <lb/>shifting to &apos;softer&apos; forms of infrastructure, while simultaneously setting up systems and incentives (linked to <lb/>results indicators, conditionalities, and greater monitoring) targeting the improvement of local governance <lb/>and institutions. They also raise warning signs for development policies elsewhere around the world. If <lb/>development policies are to be successful, they should build in an institutional component, including <lb/>promoting transparency and accountability and dealing with corruption as ways to improve the quality of <lb/>government, as an essential part of the strategic planning process. Otherwise the implementation of one-<lb/>size-fits-all policies may not yield the expected results. Taking into account place-based institutional <lb/>conditions and learning how institutional quality can be consistently improved hence needs to become a <lb/>basic element for any development strategy (Barca et al. 2012). <lb/></body>
