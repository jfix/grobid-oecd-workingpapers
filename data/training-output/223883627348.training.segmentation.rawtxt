of national family policies. The report is part of a joint EU and OECD project, which aims to help the EU 
Government Expert Group on Demographic Issues in evaluating national family policies. The idea behind 
the framework is that it allows individual countries to compare their overall performance in the area of 
family policies with the performance of other countries. The main focus of the report is policies for 
families with smaller children. The framework provides a set of cross-nationally comparable indicators on contexts, policy measures, 
and outcomes, organised on a systematic basis. The policy measure indicators presented in the report cover 
leave schemes, early childhood education and care, family benefits and workplace policies. The indicators 
build upon, inter alia, previous work by the OECD in various studies on family-friendly policies that were 
carried out on a cross-national basis using different sets of indicators. Most of these indicators are today 
available in the OECD Family Database. Wherever the OECD Family Database contains indicators for the 
majority of EU member states and OECD countries, these data have been used in the present study. 
Otherwise, data from other cross-national databases have been included. Each indicator in the framework is presented as a single-standing indicator in the general absence of 
scientific consensus on different aggregation weights. In the report no explicit ranking of countries has 
been attempted, instead the relative position of countries has been illustrated with the help of standard 
deviation scores. In the last part of the report the linkages between policy aims and the various context, outcome and 
policy measures are indicated, which help construct  " score cards " . This  " score card-approach "  is illustrated 
for three countries: Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. The report offers tools for assessment that may be developed further, and should offer an approach to 
using the OECD Family Database, acknowledging this unique data source for cross-country comparisons 
in the field of family policy. JEL classification: H2, H4, I1, I2, I3, J13, J18, J2, J3 Keywords: Parental leave schemes, early childhood education and care, family benefits, workplace

performance des politiques nationales en faveur des familles. Ce rapport fait partie d'un projet élaboré 
conjointement par l'Union Européenne et l'OCDE, qui vise à aider le groupe d'experts gouvernementaux 
sur les sujets démographiques de l'Union Européenne pour évaluer les politiques nationales d'aides aux 
familles. L'idée sous-jacente est de permettre à chaque pays de comparer ses performances avec celles des 
autres pays. Les familles avec de jeunes enfants sont le principal sujet d'analyse de ce rapport. Le cadre élaboré propose un ensemble d'indicateurs comparables entre pays sur les contextes, les 
mesures politiques et les résultats, organisés sur une base systématique. Les indicateurs de mesures 
politiques couvrent les dispositifs de congé, d'aides à l'éducation et aux soins accordées à la petite enfance, 
les prestations financières et les politiques liées au lieu de travail. Ces indicateurs ont été élaborés, inter 
alia, à partir des travaux antérieurs de l'OCDE sur les politiques favorables aux familles qui ont été 
conduites de manière comparative sur la base de différents ensembles d'indicateurs. La plupart de ces 
indicateurs sont aujourd'hui disponibles au sein de la base de données OCDE sur les Familles. Ces 
indicateurs ont été inclus pour la majorité des pays de l'Union Européenne et de l'OCDE pour lesquels ils 
sont disponibles. Lorsqu'ils n'étaient pas disponibles, des données provenant de bases internationales ont 
été prises en compte. Chaque indicateur est présenté ici de façon séparée, car il n'y a pas de consensus scientifique sur la 
pondération qui permettrait de les agréger. Aucun classement explicite des pays n'a été tenté ici ; la 
position relative des pays est, au contraire, illustrée au moyen de scores d'écarts-types. Dans la dernière partie du rapport, les liens entre les objectifs politiques et les variables de contexte, 
de résultats et de mesures politiques sont pris en compte pour élaborer des « cartes de score ». Cette 
approche par « cartes de scores » est illustrée pour trois pays : le Danemark, l'Allemagne et le Royaume-
Uni. Ce rapport offre des outils d'évaluation qui pourront être encore développés, et devrait offrir une 
approche de la manière d'utiliser la base de données de l'OCDE sur les Familles, qui constitue une source 
de données incontournable pour faire des comparaisons internationales dans le champ des politiques 
familiales.

consequences. It seems clear, however, that the contemporary family lay at its epicentre. Families across 
Europe are navigating new realities, as birth rates have fallen, solo parenting has become more 
commonplace, and older family members are living longer. In addition, in many countries, women's labour 
force participation is approaching that of men's, a change that is both cause and effect of shifting attitudes 
and values with respect to gender equality. Across diverse countries, the majority of children now live in 
families in which both or the single parent are employed, and most mothers, as well as fathers, combine 
employment with caregiving responsibilities at home. These changing patterns of family structure and labour market attachment have created new 
opportunities and unprecedented prosperity for many families. Yet these changes have also catalyzed new 
problems and needs, especially for parents, who struggle with the increasingly complex task of reconciling 
parenthood and employment. Demographic renewal in Europe clearly calls for the development of 
improved public policy supports for the millions of parents grappling with multiple challenges: balancing 
the demands of work and family, creating fair and efficient gender divisions of labour, stabilizing family 
income following birth or adoption, preserving adequate parenting time throughout their children's lives, 
and accessing, as appropriate, affordable and high-quality non-parental child care. Towards a Framework for Assessing Family Policies in the European Union was produced in 
response to these evolving private and public challenges. Its purpose is to aid supranational and national 
policy makers, employers, and other key stakeholders as they evaluate policy instruments that support 
families in these changing times. The report lays the groundwork for evaluating policies, and policy 
features, vis-à-vis the main goals identified by the European Commission and in place across member 
states of the European Union: increasing child wellbeing, improving gender equality, enabling the 
balancing of work and family life, and, in a number of countries, raising fertility. The team assembled to produce this report – internationally recognised family policy experts from 
DIW Berlin and SFI Copenhagen – has compiled a remarkably rich and comprehensive collection of 
indicators. These indicators include, first, a set of contextual and outcome variables; second, detailed 
policy indicators capturing provisions for family-related leaves, early childhood education and care, and 
family benefits; and third, work-family reconciliation programmes offered by employers. For each 
indicator, the rationale for its selection is presented, as well as an empirical portrait of variation across the 
EU-27 and OECD countries. The report culminates in an innovative exercise in which individual countries 
are scored with respect to both their context and outcome profiles and their family policy packages. This 
exercise allows countries to assess their cross-national positions regarding the core policy goals; it also 
provides a baseline against which future outcomes and policy configurations can be assessed. 1 Professor of Political Science and Sociology, The Graduate Center, City University of New York and 
Director, Luxembourg Income Study. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 9 The idea to develop this framework for assessing family policies emerged and developed during 
discussions between the authors, EU and OECD staff. The paper discusses family policy against the 
backdrop of EU employment and social policy objectives, a discussion which is also relevant to ongoing 
policy debates in OECD countries which do not belong to the EU. Throughout the project, the report 
benefitted from the support of both of these organisations. A draft version of the report was presented to 
the EU High Level Expert Group on Demographic Issues, whose members also provided invaluable 
feedback. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1. 
This report is part of a joint EU OECD project which aims to help the EU Government Expert 
Group on Demographic Issues who has expressed an interest in evaluating national family policies. The 
report presents the results of a first attempt to create a framework for assessing the performance of national 
family policies. The idea behind the framework is that it allows individual countries to compare their 
overall performance in the area of family policies with the performance of other countries. The main 
interest of the report is on policies for families with smaller children. 2. 
Improving a policy performance ideally starts with the measurement of its effects while 
accounting for the context in which it operates. Thus a set of indicators of context and outcome as well as 
policy dimensions are needed that should preferably also be comparable so that a country can see where it 
stands relative to other countries. By providing a set of indicators we hope to foster international discussion 
about the most important elements of family policy, and the contexts and outcome dimensions that should 
be used to measure them. For this purpose, our framework provides a set of cross-nationally comparable 
indicators on contexts, policies, and outcomes, organised on a systematic basis. 3. 
The indicators build upon, inter alia, previous work by the OECD in various studies on family-
friendly policies that were carried out on a cross-national basis using different sets of indicators. Most of 
these indicators are today available in the OECD Family Database. Wherever the OECD Family Database 
contains indicators for the majority of EU member states and OECD countries, these data have been used 
in the present study. Otherwise data from other cross-national databases have been included. 4. 
The indicators have been selected according to their importance and relevance for three overall 
policy goals: child wellbeing, gender equality, and balancing work and family life (see Chapter 2 for 
further elaboration of these goals). Each indicator in this framework is presented as a stand-alone indicator 
in the absence of consensus on different aggregation weights. In the report no explicit ranking of countries 
has been attempted, instead the relative position of countries has been illustrated with the help of standard 
deviation scores. This position therefore does not indicate a desired position, but merely how an individual 
country compares to other countries. 5. 
Since the report focuses on EU policy goals, the countries included are all present EU member 
states, but also as far as possible other OECD countries, in order to evaluate the EU member states within a 
larger setting. 6. 
The choice of indicators in the framework does not reflect the idea that there is a direct statistical 
causal relationship between context, policy measures, and outcomes as this would require much more 
extensive statistical testing. However, the framework does present information on a number of important 
indicators to be taken into consideration when assessing policy settings. In this way it provides a summary 
illustration of national family (policy) situations. As part of the present study, national scorecards for three 
different countries have been created by way of examples enabling these countries to assess their positions 
regarding the three policy goals relative to the other countries. The approach of the scorecards is a first 
attempt that needs to be further tested and improved with respect to its practicability and effectiveness. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 11 7. 
The report is structured in the following way: Chapter 2 provides an overview of current family 
policy goals, in particular for the EU countries. Chapter 3 presents an approach for government for 
assessing the performance of national family policies. In Chapter 4, the context and outcome indicators are 
presented for the topics of demography, parental labour market and income position, gender equality, child 
outcomes as well as childbearing preferences, values and life satisfaction. Chapter 5 provides an overview 
of those family policy indicators that are relevant for assessing leave schemes, Chapter 6 family policy 
indicators on early childhood education and care, and Chapter 7 family benefits and Chapter 8 contains 
indicators on firm and employer policy. Chapter 9 contains an assessment of the performance of some 
member states in the form of scorecards. Chapter 10 concludes the report. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 12 CHAPTER 2. GOALS IN THE FIELD OF FAMILY POLICIES 8. 
Demographic change has started to affect the industrialised world and family-friendly policies are 
occupying an increasingly prominent place on the policy agenda in many EU, OECD, and also non-OECD 
countries. Moreover many countries have already established policies in this field. Some of these policies 
and the goals behind them are very similar across countries, while others differ in their specificities. On the 
supranational level as well, various political actors have set goals in the context of family policy. In this 
chapter, we discuss the policy goals of the EU, one of the key political actors on the supranational level. It 
is however important to keep in mind that the political responsibility for family policies has largely 
remained with the member states and that any EU goals are always firmly based on a consensus view of 
the member states. We also add a short description of UN goals in this field, since the UN includes more 
OECD member states than just those in the EU. 9. 
In general, the European Union views families as a source of economic prosperity, and 
encourages the member states to incorporate family policies into their broader economic and social 
policies. Already under the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs some targets and tools of the European 
Union in this context have been formulated. These aims were described as important for improved 
reconciliation of family and working life and for the development of policy responses to demographic 
change (European Council 2007: p. 4). One aim set by the Lisbon European Council in 2000 was to 
increase the proportion of women in employment to more than 60% by 2010. In 2001, the Stockholm 
European Council proposed the development of indicators for the services provided by care facilities for 
children and other dependents and by family benefit systems. In 2002, the Barcelona European Council 
advocated that by 2010, countries should provide childcare to at least 90% of children between 3 and 6 
years old and to at least 33% of children under 3 years old. In 2006, the Spring European Council 
emphasised the necessity to significantly reduce child poverty and to provide all children with equal 
opportunities, regardless of their social background. The European Council of 2007 concluded that it is 
necessary to emphasise sustainable family policies in order to improve social cohesion, and their decision 
outlines areas of importance to family policies. Yet the European Union has stated explicitly that its 
member states themselves are responsible for formulating appropriate, sustainable family policies. Hence 
the EU targets for family policies are guidelines with shared objectives that the member states should 
consider in setting their own policies. 10. 
Gender equality, based on the equal-pay principle (article 141 of the EU treaty), is an official 
policy priority of the European Union with important implications for families. The EU monitors and 
promotes gender mainstreaming, and it tackles the gender pay gap explicitly through such initiatives as the 
analysis of current legislation in order to urge the member states to implement existing legislation on the 
provision of information about equality measures and to raise awareness about existing laws (European 
Commission 2007b: p. 8). Gender equality is also promoted with the financial support from the European 
Social Fund, the European Commission in its two communications, has set targets for equal opportunity. 
The 2002 Barcelona targets state that efforts should be made to increase formal child care services to 
enable women and men to better reconcile work and family life. Here, the services available on the market 
are adapting too slowly to a situation in which both men and women work. Yet this will also involve 
parental leave policies. The Roadmap for equality of women and men (2006-2013) states that  " fewer men 
take parental leave or work part-time (7.4% compared to 32.6% for women) and women remain the main 
carers of children and other dependents "  (European Commission 2006a: p. 5). The EU strongly encourages 
men to take parental leave as well. Lindén points out that as a strategy the EU advises its member states to DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 13 study closely those member states  " that have developed successful policies in this area, for instance the 
Swedish parental leave system and its father's quota, and thus indirectly give direction "  (Lindén, 2007: 
p. 11). This is supported by the Parental Leave Directive (96/34/EC) of the European Council, which states 
that male and female workers have individual entitlement to parental leave (see also Chapter 5). The 
Commission identified several areas where the Maternity Leave Directive Pregnant Workers Directive 
(1992) could be improved. This Directive is one of the few EU laws in the field of social policy (Lindén, 
2007: p. 10). It provides provisional measures to protect workers who have recently given birth or are 
breastfeeding against the risks related to chemical, physical and biological agents. Additionally, the 
Directive contains specific provisions regarding night work, maternity leave, pre-natal examinations, 
employment rights, and protection against discriminatory dismissal (Council Directive 92/85/EEC). The 
Pregnant Workers Directive could be improved regarding the duration of leave, the level of payment, the 
access of self employed and their partners, and the protection of women returning from maternity leave to 
work. The consultation document also identifies six areas where the provisions for parental leave could be 
improved, providing suggestions for action on the following aspects (European Commission, 2007c): 
(1) Incentives for fathers to take parental leave, (2) Employment rights and prohibiting discrimination 
(making sure workers who take parental leave do not encounter less favourable working conditions), 
(3) Duration of parental leave, (4) Flexibility in relation to the taking of leave (the possibility to take leave 
in a piecemeal way), (5) The age-bracket of the child for which parental leave can be taken (increasing the 
age limit to cover the entire primary school cycle) and (6) Payment during parental leave (linking payment 
on parental leave to a workers' salary). 11. 
In September 2008, the social partners at the European level launched negotiations on parental 
leave with a view to revising the existing EU legislation based on a framework agreement concluded by 
European employer and trade union representatives (European Commission, 2008b). Additionally, in 
October 2008, the EU Commission proposed a change in maternity leave revising the Pregnant Worker's 
Directive (European Commission, 2008b). 12. 
Another integral part of the Lisbon Strategy is the so-called Open Method of Coordination 
(OMC) which presupposes that member states should define certain policy targets as a  " common concern, 
whereas the actual choice of policies remains a national responsibility "  (Scharpf, 2001). The procedure 
involves the participation of the member states by the formulation of national action plans, and is seen as a 
method of best practice. This is a new approach applied by the EU to  " achieve growth, modernisation and 
welfare, and is about policy learning instead of binding law "  (Lindén, 2007: p. 9). There are currently 
several OMCs in place and the one most relevant to family policy is dedicated to (child) poverty and more 
generally social exclusion. It is clear that a more formal discussion of these issues at the EU level may lead 
to more consensuses among the member states about what  " EU family policy "  should be about. 13. 
In its guidelines, the European Union addresses the different aspects of family policy. First, 
improving the social infrastructure for families plays an important role in the fight against poverty, since it 
enables parents to enter and stay in employment. It is important to provide affordable and accessible care 
services for children, which includes parental education, training for care providers and daycare workers, 
and leisure-time facilities for young people (European Council, 2007: p. 6). Second, family policies should 
focus on providing support for families that helps to compensate for the costs of raising children, especially 
during the period immediately after birth, and that takes into account the specific needs of single-parent 
families and of families with a large number of children (European Council, 2007: p. 6). A final suggestion 
by the Council is directed at reconciliation:  " a better balance between employment and security 
( " flexicurity " ) over the life cycle to the benefit of family life, including in particular appropriate 
arrangements for parental and care leave for both women and men, better access to lifelong learning, and 
ensuring gender equality in employment "  (European Council, 2007: p. 6). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 14 14. 
The new European Alliance for Families is slowly becoming more influential in the development 
of a common EU approach to family policies in recent years. This initiative goes back to the year 2007, 
when the EU heads of state and government decided at the European Summit of 8 and 9 March 2007, to 
establish a European Alliance for Families. Through the Alliance the EU hopes to create impulses for more 
family-friendly policies. The Alliance is intended as an instrument to foster cooperation and fruitful 
learning from each other in the European Union. In May 2007, the Permanent Representatives Committee 
submitted its  " Conclusions of the Council on 'Alliance for Families' "  to the Council for adoption. Here, 
tools and targets of the European Union, as well as opinions on issues related to family-friendly policies, 
are summarised and discussed. The paper represents the EU's first step towards a European  " family 
policy "  approach and was developed in close cooperation with its member states. Thus, the European 
Alliance for Families constitutes one tool in a set of various family-related approaches on the EU level. 
The Commission has stated that this alliance  " will first of all take the form of a platform for exchanges and 
knowledge concerning pro-family policies and best practices in the Member States "  (European 
Commission, 2007a: p. 7). 15. 
The discussion of the actual content of the EU goals above, makes it possible to identify three 
key dimensions which in our view together summarise the Commission's and thus also the member states' 
family policy goals: These three dimensions or  " aims "  as we will call them in the remainder of this report, 
are (1) child wellbeing, (2) gender equality, and (3) balancing work and family life. These three aims 
are, however, interrelated, and development in one area often depends on development in another. There is 
empirical evidence that a good balance between work and family life improves child wellbeing, as the life 
satisfaction of parents improves if they can achieve their preferred balance between family life and work. 
Moreover, one could argue that there is a fourth dimension: namely, the need to increase fertility in those 
member states where fertility rates are markedly low. Although low fertility in many member states has 
become a  " matter of public concern "  none of the explicitly stated EU goals deal directly with this issue. 
The 2006 Communication of the Commission on  " The demographic future of Europe from challenge to 
opportunity "  (European Commission, 2006b) for instance uses the term  " demographic renewal "  instead of 
talking about a need for higher birth rates. Much the same is true on the national level. Even among the 
member states who have low fertility rates and are aware of their consequences, only a few countries have 
made the aim of increasing fertility an explicit and official policy goal. This might be due to the difficulty 
of finding evidence of clear and direct correlations between family policy and birth rates, and particularly 
in demonstrating that increased family benefits (e.g., taxes and transfers) actually increase fertility. Instead 
the most frequently adopted policy goal has been to make it easier for young people to have the number of 
children they desire by extending public support to families. 16. 
The first dimension of EU family policy, child wellbeing, focuses on children as family 
members. The European Union regards an increase in the wellbeing of children and young people as a 
means of helping future generations to develop to their full potential and of enabling them to contribute 
more to society and to the economy (European Commission, 2008a: p. 111). An important EU objective is 
to reduce child poverty, since  " despite overall progress in the labour market, this figure (at 19% the risk of 
poverty among children in the EU is higher than that of the general population) has remained unchanged 
since 2000 "  (European Commission, 2008a: p. 112). The EU has also addressed child health and 
development, as described in the WHO European strategy for child and adolescent health and 
development. Furthermore, in the framework of the programme Education and Training 2010, the member 
states have committed themselves to reducing the school dropout rate in the EU to a maximum of 10% by 
2010 (European Commission, 2008a: p. 26). The European Commission has stated that the best means of 
overcoming child poverty is by  " addressing the issue on all fronts and striking the appropriate balance 
between targeting the family and the child in its own right. This entails combining strategies to increase 
parents' access and attachment to employment with enabling services and with income support that 
minimise the risk of creating trap effects "  (European Commission, 2008a: p. 112). Hence, the EU advises 
all of its member states to apply a balanced policy mix. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 15 17. 
As part of the EU's gender equality policy, the Commission promotes equal participation of 
women and men in paid work, equal pay for equal work and a higher women's participation in politics or 
in economic decision-making through transparency in promotion processes, flexible working 
arrangements, and availability of child care facilities (European Commission, 2006a: p. 6). Furthermore, 
the EU has stressed the importance of eradicating gender-based violence, focusing on gender equality 
targets, and also eliminating gender stereotypes in society. According to the EU, gender stereotypes occur 
in education, in the labour market, and in the media (European Commission, 2006a: p. 8). The Commission 
emphasises the need to increase public awareness of this issue, and encourages young women and men to 
pursue non-traditional educational paths. To overcome the segregation in the labour market, the EU 
suggests that anti-discrimination laws be enforced and that special incentives be offered for female 
employment. The media should present a realistic picture of the skills and potentials of women and men in 
society (European Commission, 2006a: p. 8). 18. 
With respect to the third dimension, balancing work and family life, the EU uses reconciliation 
policies to strengthen the position of parents on the labour market. Parental employment is a major 
component of family policies and it is also clearly intertwined with targets for gender equality. The 
employment targets formulated in the Lisbon Strategy are thus assigned to the member states, who are 
expected to develop corresponding policies to achieve them. The European Commission addresses a 
variety of other family issues indirectly – for example, by setting key policy priorities through the OMC 
for eradicating poverty and social exclusion. The indicator of parental labour market position may also 
reflect family poverty and/or child poverty, and is thus directly related to the EU's stated goals of 
improving social inclusion and providing equal opportunities. The EU describes an increase in labour 
market participation as an important priority to overcome poverty, but also as a useful step to balance work 
and family life. Family poverty should be eradicated by modernising social protection systems. Providing 
family benefits, both universal and targeted benefits, is a key tool in combating poverty. These policies 
could be implemented usefully by expanding childcare facilities, providing flexible or part-time working 
arrangements, and offering financial support to families with young children. Again, the European 
Commission does not explicitly state policies or set targets for the member states to meet, but it does 
suggest the method of OMC (Lindén, 2007: p. 14). Furthermore, balancing work and family life also 
implies improved education and wellbeing for all family members. By fostering educational attainment, 
social exclusion problems are tackled in line with the overall European Commission goal of reducing 
disadvantages in education and training. This particular goal is also one of the seven key policy priorities 
(European Commission, 2005a: p. 6-7). The EU also advocates that its member states prevent early 
departures from formal education and training. 19. 
Analogously to the EU targets mentioned above – child wellbeing, gender equality, and 
balancing work and family life – the non-EU OECD countries as well as the European countries are 
following the Beijing Platform for Action developed by the UN during the Fourth World Conference on 
Women (UN, 1995). The Platform for Action pursues the empowerment of women. It aims at abolishing 
the obstacles to women's participation in public and private life through a full and equal share in 
economic, social, cultural and political decision-making. This emphasises the principle of shared 
responsibility between women and men at home, in the workplace and in the wider communities. Particular 
interest in balancing work and family life is expressed in strategic objective F.6, which is to  " Promote 
harmonization of work and family responsibilities for women and men "  under the topic Women and the 
Economy (UN, 1995). Another objective advocated by the UN, as well as by the EU, is equality of 
opportunity. The majority of non-European OECD countries also support the reconciliation of work and 
private life following the UN Platform for Action established in Beijing. Apart from this, it should be kept 
in mind that every country has its own approaches to family policy, which is true of both EU member 
states as well as non-EU countries – for example, Japan, whose focus is on the relatively low Japanese 
fertility rate, and Canada, whose specific focus is on legislation to improve policies on the employer/firm 
level (OECD, 2008a). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 16 CHAPTER 3. APPROACHES TO THE ASSESSMENT OF FAMILY POLICIES 20. 
This chapter provides an overview of some theoretical and empirical observations and 
approaches to assessing family policy in order to help understand the variety of policy goals and the use of 
family policy instruments across different national contexts. It also outlines the elements of a more 
practical approach that countries can use to assess family policies at the national level. 3.1 
Family Policy Variation across Contexts – Theoretical and Empirical Observations 21. 
Theoretical analysis of family policy programmes generally supports the common division of 
countries into universalist (social democrat), residual (liberal economic), and social insurance 
(conservative) welfare regimes as originally formulated and further developed by Esping-Andersen (1997) 
(see also Gauthier, 2002). These groupings often correspond to regional country clusters. 22. 
The universalist welfare regime is known for its universal state support for families, high 
commitment to gender equality in work and care, and strong support for working parents. The Nordic 
countries are examples of this welfare regime. The social insurance regime is characterised by a medium 
level of support for families, mainly in the form of cash benefits that are often related to working status. 
This regime tends to support a traditional male breadwinner model, where the man works full-time and the 
woman is responsible for the domestic sphere. Countries traditionally belonging to this model include, for 
example, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In the residual welfare regime, we find low support for 
families, and the few policies that do exist are mainly targeted at groups in the population with special 
needs. The state is not supposed to interfere in private matters, and there is wide support for market 
solutions. In this welfare regime, we find UK, Australia, the United States, and Switzerland. 23. 
In addition, there may also be a fourth model comprising the southern European countries. This 
model is characterised by fragmentation along occupational lines, and by a combination of universal and 
private services and benefits. There is usually no national guaranteed statutory minimum income scheme 
(Gauthier, 2002). 24. 
In regard to the eastern European countries, there is no general agreement on a predominant 
model, given the wide variation in the institutional structure of social security programmes and the 
different levels of social and economic performance among countries (Kangas, 1999; Manning, 2004). 
Some would, however, argue that a separate East European/post-socialist model is emerging, which does 
not fall into Esping-Andersen's categorisation of welfare models but has characteristics of both the liberal 
and conservative corporatist regimes, as well as some distinct features of its own, such as a mixture of 
insurance-based but universally covered schemes, high-take up rates but low benefits (Kaariainen & 
Lehtonen, 2006; van Oorschots & Arts, 2005). 25. 
Although the main characteristics of the welfare regimes appear to persist, since the 1970s there 
seems to be some common response among countries to demographic changes and diversifying family 
forms, constrained budgets, increasing EU coordination of policies, and global economic integration 
(Gauthier, 2002). The demographic changes that have emerged with ageing populations and falling fertility 
rates thus seem to have become influential drivers of policy change with regard to the need to reconsider 
family policy and its role in helping men and women start families. Most countries within the EU are today 
promoting the adult worker model, in which men and women are assumed equally employable, in order to DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 17 improve economic growth, promote social inclusion, combat problems of a shrinking labour force, and 
tackle poverty. The adult worker model presupposes a new understanding of optimal ways of sharing paid 
work and care work, not only between state, market, and family, but also between men and women. 
Gender equality is also one of the policy drivers, but is seen by some as a largely rhetorical goal, especially 
outside the Nordic countries (Stratigaki, 2000). The adult worker model has accentuated the need to 
promote policies that can help men and women balance work and family life. Also, among all these 
models, there seems to be more attention to children overall, but the investments focus mainly on children 
as future workers, ensuring that they acquire the skills and competencies they will need on the job market, 
or as Lewis (2008: 10) phrases it, more in their  " ability of becoming than being. "  26. 
This has not resulted in full convergence among different countries' national family policies, but 
there has been a general increase in public support for working parents across countries, attempting to 
make it easier for them to reconcile work and family life. There has also been a greater focus on children's 
outcomes and investments in the services provided to them. 27. 
Regarding the approach to daycare, parental leave, and family policies on the employer/firm 
level, Bennett (2008) outlines that in the universalist countries of northern Europe there seems to be a 
societal approach to daycare that encompasses the full-employment paradigm (at least after a leave period), 
so that the state provides parental leave, early childhood education and care (ECEC), and family-friendly 
jobs. In the central European countries, there is a belief that the young child is better off being cared for in 
the family, and consequently, leave schemes are relatively long but in general with low or no pay. 
Germany, however, has been in transition since the introduction of parental leave with a wage replacement 
benefit (Spiess & Wrohlich, 2008). In many of the former communist countries of eastern Europe, where 
daycare used to be provided to the majority of children, daycare services have been replaced by extended 
leave schemes (Rostgaard, 2004). In countries belonging to the residual welfare regime, female labour 
force participation is encouraged just as in other countries, but no public and/or subsidised daycare is 
provided. 3.2 
Practical Assessment of Family Policy 28. 
How are countries assessed in practice in most family policy models? Gauthier (2002) notes that 
the literature contains two main approaches: first, the family type approach assesses the impact of family 
policy in variations of family types, across a number of countries. This approach has been used by 
Bradshaw and others (e.g., Bradshaw and Finch, 2002) in a series of studies of European countries. Their 
analysis showed considerable differences between countries, but also suffered from the problem of the 
need to constantly update data. 29. 
A second approach, which has been applied, for example, by Kamerman & Kahn (1997), and 
Pampel & Adams (1992), looks at aggregate data such as on social expenditure . This approach cannot take 
into account the variation in family types, and is vulnerable, for example, to fluctuations in GDP. On the 
other hand, it enables comparisons across a number of years. 30. 
One may add to this approach the study by Gornick and Meyers (2003) assessing countries on the 
basis of their respective family policy designs. The authors developed a quantitative family policy index in 
which elements of policies were evaluated and weighted according to their supposed importance – for 
example, compensation rates for parental leave or parental payment of daycare services. These policy 
indicators were supplemented with data on, for example, social expenditure. In this way, the important 
institutional differences among policy programmes were acknowledged while also employing aggregate 
data. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 18 31. 
Overall, the various attempts in the literature to assess family policy depend heavily on the 
research interests of the team developing the respective approach. These research interests are embedded in 
various disciplines, such as sociology, economics, political science, and thereby differ in approach and 
focus. Some approaches may also be designed to promote a particular policy model, and the selection of 
indicators may reflect this. 32. 
Studies assessing family policies sometimes result in a specific weighting of particular measures 
or indicators. Based on this weighting, overall scores can be calculated. (It is important to keep in mind, 
however, that even a non-weighted summary score of various indicators implicitly assumes that all 
measures have the same weight.) Finally, data availability also shapes the scientific approach and 
conceptualisations of family policy. 33. 
This report combines previous approaches with an approach that should provide a transparent and 
up-to-date analysis of the data. Overall, the writing of the report is driven by the ambition of the EU 
Commission to develop a framework to assess family policies for its government expert group on 
demographic issues that is independent of particular research approaches and – as much as possible – 
independent of particular policy preferences, but at the same time, using a straightforward and transparent 
approach. Moreover, the idea is that in the medium run, this framework should be entirely based on the 
indicators of the OECD Family Database (see below). 34. 
On the one hand, our approach combines former approaches by looking at outcomes for family 
types and by looking at expenditure data. On the other hand, our main emphasis is on the different 
dimensions of family policy goals or aims, and on the measures of family policy. This report also identifies 
the aims and measures of family policies, quantifies and compares them, but in comparison to the Gornick 
and Meyers (2003) approach, for instance, it does not calculate aggregate scores based on weights. 
Nevertheless, we are aware of the fact that even a non-weighted summary score of various indicators 
implicitly assumes that all measures have the same weight. In this respect, our approach can be considered 
as  " normative "  as well. 35. 
In order to cope with the great variety of available indicators, the following search strategy was 
used: the primary data source for this exercise is the indicators of the current OECD Family Database (see 
Box 1). In the case that no information was available or in the case of missing information for some 
countries, further efforts were made to find other sources offering appropriate information. Detailed 
information was available in some cases, and in some other cases no information could be found at all. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 19 Box 1. The OECD Family Database The OECD Family Database is a collection of cross-national indicators on family outcomes and family policies 2 . 
At present, the focus of the database is on families with children. It does not include indicators on the position and care 
needs of elderly family members. The database began to be developed in 2006. The aim is to provide data covering a 
broad range of topics categorised into four broad headings, each of which is sub-divided into three or four 
subheadings. The development of the database is an on-going process. It is intended to provide full information on 54 
indicators by mid-2009. As of March 2009, 37 indicators were available. The four broad headings are: @BULLET The structure of families (SF) @BULLET The labour market position of families (LMF) @BULLET Public policies for family and children (PF) @BULLET Child outcomes (CO) For each subheading, the database provides between two and six indicators, which originate from different 
sources. Most of the indicators are taken from other OECD databases (e.g., the OECD Social Expenditure Database, 
the OECD Benefits and Wages Database or the OECD Education Database) or from databases maintained by other 
(international) organisations (e.g., Eurostat, UN). Each indicator combines a variety of statistics (e.g., the indicator SF1 
on family size and composition provides information on the size of households by household type, the distribution of 
households by type, the share of households with children by household type, and the distribution of households by 
number of children). Most of the information is provided in cross-sectional perspective. For some topics longitudinal 
information is also available. It is intended to provide information on 38 countries, i.e., all OECD countries and all non-
OECD EU member states, but not all statistics are available for the full country sample. Some statistics cover less than 
15 countries. All information is provided online. The presentation of the indicators differs (charts, tables and description 
of transfer and care systems). 36. 
The framework is structured according to context, outcome, and policy measure indicators. It is 
important to have information on the context in which family policy is assessed, as it is obvious that 
family policy depends on the overall socio-demographic and socio-economic context of a country. 
Furthermore, the family policy of a country can be assessed by analysing various outcome indicators. It 
is, however, worth keeping in mind that the distinction between context and outcome indicators may seem 
arbitrary or at times even irrelevant, for example, whether to treat labour force participation or fertility as 
an outcome or a context indicator. Most important, family policy should be assessed by analysing measures 
in particular policy fields. Based on the OECD approach of  " Babies and Bosses "  (OECD, 2007), we 
distinguish four fields of policy measures: parental leave policies, early childhood education and care, 
family benefits, and policies on the employer/firm level. Various indicators have been selected to 
describe all four policy measurement fields as well as the outcomes and contexts. 37. 
Since a practical approach to assessing family policy should not cover all indicators, mainly for 
reasons of  " practicability " , we selected a certain number of indicators in each field. We propose to work 
with a limited number of indicators for a core assessment of family policy. Ideally, such a core 
assessment should be based on indicators that are available for a maximum number of countries and for the 
most recent years. However, these two criteria still leave a large number of indicators to be analysed, at 
least if the focus is on the context or the outcomes. Therefore, further selections had to be made. For each 
field we propose a selection based on the current research literature, meaning that we select those 
indicators that were used most often in the literature. This allowed us to develop a core framework of 
indicators. If a core assessment turns out to be too limited, a broader set of indicators may be used. The 
OECD Family Database and other sources offer additional indicators which could be useful for a more 
extensive assessment of family policy. 2 See http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,2340,en_2649_34819_37836996_1_1_1_1,00.html (22 April 2009). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 20 38. 
Once indicators have been selected for our core assessment of family policy, a method is needed 
to analyse them. We base our method on the earlier work of the OECD as described in the  " Babies and 
Bosses "  reports (OECD, 2007): in the chapters presenting the context, outcome, and indicators on policy 
measures, the indicators of a country will be assessed according to the standard deviations of the 
particular indicators. On the basis of calculated standard deviations, countries can be divided into three 
groups: (1) <= -½ of the standard deviation (2) -½ to +½ standard deviation and (3) >= + ½ standard 
deviation. Thus, for each indicator, countries are grouped according to their position in the overall 
distribution of countries. For reasons of simplicity, three different symbols are used in the tables to identify 
the countries: Group (1): <, Group (2): 0, Group (3): >. With the help of three these groupings, the 
differences in a countries' family policies in each field can be described in comparison to all other 
countries. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 21 CHAPTER 4. CONTEXTS AND OUTCOMES OF FAMILY POLICIES 39. 
Knowledge of national contexts is crucial for understanding the possible implications of 
demographic trends and for identifying where family policy interventions are needed. Policy-making 
requires an understanding of demographic factors, since changes in the size, composition and growth rate 
of the population can have an impact on many life domains, both social and economic. This chapter 
outlines what we consider to be the most important socio-demographic and socio-economic indicators to 
describe and assess the contexts of family policy. 40. 
Apart from context indicators, a family policy assessment framework should also provide an 
overview of the outcomes of existing policies in order to determine what needs to be changed or improved. 
However, drawing a clear distinction between context and outcome indicators is often possible only from a 
short-term perspective. In the long run – or even in the medium term – context measures may change and 
in fact become outcome measures. Outcome indicators, on the other hand, may be context indicators in the 
short run. The example of fertility may make this clearer. In the short run, it is obvious that fertility rates 
are one of the indicators describing the context of national or even supranational family policies. In the 
long run, however, policy measures might affect fertility rates either negatively or positively. Although 
there is no clear empirical evidence on the direction of the influence of family policy, it can be argued that 
fertility rates are an outcome indicator for a country's family policy. Figure 1 illustrates this 
interdependence. Figure 1. Interdependence of context, outcomes and policy measures 41. 
Given the difficulty of drawing a clear distinction between context and outcome indicators, we 
group potential context and outcome indicators instead according to the subject of the indicators, such as 
demography, parental labour market and income positions, gender equality, child outcomes and values, 
preferences and life satisfaction. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 22 4.1 
Selection of Indicators 42. 
The selected indicators can mainly be found in the OECD Family Database, 3 except where noted 
otherwise. In the following we briefly discuss how the indicators are selected and describe them 
individually. For each group, we start with a summary of the respective indicators in a box. Box 2. Indicators for core assessment: demography @BULLET Life expectancy @BULLET Fertility rate @BULLET Teenage births @BULLET Women's average age at first child birth @BULLET Out-of-wedlock births @BULLET Lone-parent households @BULLET Average household size @BULLET Proportion of families with no children 43. 
The most debated demographic trend in developed countries is without doubt declining 
population growth, which is a cause of societal ageing. Most countries are experiencing declining 
population growth because the number of children being born is lower than the number of people dying. 
One cause of societal ageing is that people are living longer. Low mortality levels and thus increasing life 
expectancy trigger population ageing. Life expectancy is one of the first indicators presented in this 
chapter to describe the variation in contexts across the countries. Life expectancy at birth is calculated as 
the average number of years a person is expected to live, subject to current mortality trends. Over time, life 
expectancy has been increasing in most countries, faster for women than for men. Generally, however, the 
gap between men and women is narrowing, at least in Europe (Council of Europe, 2004). 44. 
Among the causes of population decline is the declining number of births, which has been 
experienced in all of the OECD countries over the past several decades. The fertility rate is an indicator 
that explains variation in reproduction between countries, taking into account current fertility levels. The 
decline in fertility is often associated with women's higher educational attainment and increasing labour-
market participation. In turn, as a result of the higher female involvement in the labour force, the 
opportunity cost of foregone wages is assumed to be related to women's desire to have children. Although 
the fall in fertility rates has been seen in all of the countries under examination here, the pace of the decline 
and the present levels vary between countries. The decline in fertility rates started early in the Nordic 
countries, in the 1960s, but stabilised around 1.8 in the early 1990s, whereas the southern European 
countries, for example, experienced a decline beginning in the mid-1970s leading to currently very low 
figures. Fertility rates are often calculated as the period total fertility rate (TFR), which is the total number 
of children born to each woman over her life cycle if current fertility rates remained constant at every age. 
Total period fertility rates are sensitive to the timing of births, that is, fertility rates may decline in severe 
economic periods. Should a couple decide to postpone having a child, the total fertility rate will 
immediately be affected, whereas the completed fertility rate may stay the same if the couple ends up 
having the originally intended number of children. Total fertility rates are, however, often used in 
international comparisons, as they are more widely available and allow the tracking of recent changes 
(e.g., d'Addio and d'Ercole, 2005). The age group considered for the calculation of fertility is, in all OECD 
countries, 15 to 49. It is, however, worth noting that some women give birth after their 50 th birthday due to 
recent advances in fertility-enhancing therapies (d'Addio and d'Ercole, 2005), which is why age-grouped 
fertility rates may be preferable. 3 In the tables covering the indicators, the tag is reported in parentheses. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 23 45. 
Special attention is often paid to the rate of teenage births, as these are women who will often 
face problems continuing their education or gaining a foothold in the labour market after giving birth, so 
the teenage birth rate is reported as an indicator. 46. 
One key determinant of declining fertility rates is that women are postponing having their first 
child, and this tendency is considered to be the most important factor behind the so-called  " second 
demographic transition "  in the OECD countries (van de Kaa, 1987). Women's average age at first birth 
will be used as an indicator in this report to underscore the sensitivity of the total fertility rate, but also to 
emphasise what are believed to be the associated risks in terms of childlessness and higher health risks for 
mothers and children (d'Addio and d'Ercole, 2005). 47. 
Among the countries where out-of-wedlock births are more frequent, statistics suggest that 
fertility rates are also lower (d'Addio and d'Ercole, 2005). 48. 
Another crucial indicator, usually referred to as a context indicator, is the number of single-
person households. Data from the OECD shows that from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s we have 
witnessed an increase in the population share of single-person households (OECD, 1999). Not all of these 
singles have dependent children, and some of them are young and elderly persons who for various reasons 
live without a partner. However, we have also witnessed an increase in the number of lone-parent families 
in the last 40 years (OECD, 2007). The share of lone-parent households as a proportion of all 
households with children is used here to report the proportion of children who grow up in a household 
with only one breadwinner, which can be an important indication of how many children risk living in an 
economically vulnerable family. Across the OECD countries in general, poverty risks are proportionally 
much higher among children living in single-parent households than for children living in two-parent 
households, whether or not the parents are working (OECD, 2007). 49. 
The decline in fertility also results both in smaller average numbers of persons overall in 
households, and in a tendency to have a smaller number of children per household. We suggest using the 
average household size and also the proportion of households with no children to describe the context. 
Both indicators are sensitive to the age composition of the population, as societal ageing means that a 
larger proportion of persons presumably live without children under age 18. Family structures are also 
changing as divorce and separation rates rise, resulting in a larger proportion of households without 
dependent children. However, both measures can be used as crude indicators of the tendency for more and 
more men and women to have fewer children and of the tendency for some of them to remain childless. At 
this stage, we do not include the number of households with children, as most data on this are divided 
according to the number of children and thus would require substantially more space to report. Box 3. Indicators for core assessment: parental labour market and income positions @BULLET Maternal employment rates @BULLET Part-time and full-time employment for women @BULLET Part-time and full-time employment for men @BULLET Statutory maximum of working hours @BULLET Average number of actual working hours @BULLET Current vs. preferred working hours of parents @BULLET Poverty in households with children 50. 
Another set of indicators that can be characterised as context indicators in the short run and 
outcome indicators in the long run refers to the labour market position of parents and the income position 
of families. The obstacles parents may face in combining work obligations and childcare responsibilities 
are diverse in the sense that working permits parents to maintain a certain living standard that contributes DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 24 positively to child development, yet working time deprives children of time spent with their parents. With 
respect to the two policy aims of promoting child wellbeing and enabling parents to balance work and 
family life, countries that want to assess their family policy should look at indicators reporting parental 
labour market and income positions. 51. 
Given that mothers still hold the main care-giving responsibility for younger children, it is crucial 
to analyse maternal employment rates. The indicator we refer to covers mothers with children up to the 
age of 16. A more detailed analysis should use more specific maternal employment rates: Usually 
employment rates are available for mothers of children up to the age of three, three to six, and six and 
older. Employment rates usually increase with the age of the child, which is a result of maternal or paternal 
preferences for employment, the demand side of the labour market, leave regulations, daycare provision 
and so on. Apart from maternal employment, the type of employment is important. Part-time work is one 
of the most important means of balancing work and family life. Still, part-time workers are mainly women 
and especially mothers. Thus, one indicator for assessment should be the part-time employment of 
women. Again, a deeper analysis could differentiate between the part-time employment rates of women 
without children and those of women with children in different age groups. Moreover, part-time 
employment rates could also differ by the number of average hours working part-time. This reflects the 
broad variety of part-time work. Such indicators could also indicate whether part-time work substantially 
increases the financial resources of families. This is important as parental employment can contribute to 
the aim of reducing child poverty. Part-time employment rates for men show that this is still not a 
widely used tool for taking on childcare responsibilities. Men usually work full-time and do not adjust their 
working hours for family reasons. However, country differences in part-time employment rates for men 
might show differences in the outcomes of different family policies. The same differences might be useful 
for the analysis of full-time employment rates of women and men, respectively. 52. 
Apart from adjusting working hours by switching to part-time employment, the statutory 
maximum and the average number of actual working hours are indicators that make it possible to 
assess a country's overall policy with regard to work-life balance concepts. They give a good picture of the 
overall statutory framework and the real outcomes. Statutory working-time requirements protect 
employees from being required to work beyond legal limits, but also provide information on time 
allocation by employees with care responsibilities. If their statutory maximum working time is already 
high, employees with care responsibilities could face greater difficulties combining work and family life. 
The actual working hours also gives hints as to how parents' work-life balance is affected by overtime or 
other unplanned work schedules. 53. 
While all indicators reported so far deal with working-time arrangements and regulations, they do 
not account for the time allocations of employees during the day. Working parents and employees with 
care obligations are often required to organise their duties around their working time. Therefore, it could be 
informative to assess the quality of the work-life balance by comparing the actual hours parents worked to 
their preferred hours of work. A gap could indicate a need for different policies to allow parents to fulfil 
their care obligations as well as their working arrangements. This indicator of differences between 
preferred and actual hours of work could demonstrate how the combination of national level support and 
firm-level practices enables parents to target their preferred distribution of work and care. The respective 
indicators are not yet available in the OECD Family Database but are planned for future inclusion. 54. 
Both the income position and the employment status of parents influence the poverty risks of 
their children. Parental income is another indirect indicator of child wellbeing and thus useful for the 
assessment of family policy. Parental income positions can be assessed using an indicator of poverty in 
households with children. This indicator is part of the OECD Family Database, and presents figures on 
the percentage of all households with children and a working-age household head facing poverty. A 
household is considered poor if the equivalised income of all household members lies below the 50% DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 25 median threshold. 4 The percentage of families living in poverty tends to be slightly lower than the 
percentage of children living in poverty. The interplay between parental living arrangements and 
employment status is revealed when considering the possible relationship between mothers in paid work 
and child poverty. The OECD reports that countries with higher levels of maternal employment report 
lower poverty rates among children (OECD, 2008b). This indicator differs from child poverty slightly with 
regard to the unit of measurement. The poverty of households with children refers to all individuals in the 
family living below the poverty line – adults and children. Box 4. Indicators for core assessment: gender equality @BULLET Gender gap in employment @BULLET Gender wage gap 55. 
With respect to gender equality, we suggest that countries assess the gender gap in employment 
reported by the OECD Family Database. The gender gap in employment indicates percentage point 
differences between employment rates for men and women of the same age. Here, the OECD refers to the 
population aged 25 to 64. The value countries assess thus measures how many women relative to men are 
in full-time employment. A high value indicates that fewer women than men are working full-time. 56. 
The gender gap that has received the most attention, however, is the difference in reported 
earnings for men and women. Countries should therefore also consider the gender pay gap when 
evaluating gender equality. Across the OECD countries, fewer women than men are employed, on average, 
and they are paid less than their male colleagues (OECD, 2008b). Both the EU and the UN have addressed 
the gender pay gap explicitly in an attempt to achieve equality between women and men. The gender wage 
gap is calculated as the ratio of median earnings of female employees relative to male employees. The 
earnings used refer to gross full-time wage and salary workers (OECD, 2008b). Box 5. Indicators for core assessment: child outcomes @BULLET Child poverty @BULLET Children in families by employment status* @BULLET Infant mortality rate @BULLET Low birth weight @BULLET PISA scores @BULLET Literacy scores, age nine* @BULLET Young people not in education * Indicator planned to be included in the OECD Family Database 57. 
Child outcome indicators in various fields can be analysed with respect to both material outcomes 
and health and child development (for such an approach, see, for instance, UNICEF, 2007). All of these 
could, in principle, be further differentiated according to a child's age. 58. 
One of the main indicators with regard to material resources is child poverty. Like poverty in 
households with children, this captures the percentage of children living below the poverty line, using 50% 
of the median equivalised income as a threshold. Children living in poor families face obstacles to their 4 It should be mentioned that the broad poverty literature offers various concepts for measuring poverty. 
Given the range of measurement concepts available, there are also various indicators available, which 
should be interpreted with care. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 26 development. If countries want to assess their performance in improving child wellbeing, they should 
consider the indicator for child income poverty. 5 Reducing child poverty is an important objective, 
especially among EU member states. However, UNICEF states that such poverty measures, while 
necessary, are not sufficient indicators of children's material wellbeing, since all such measurements are 
based on household income (UNICEF, 2007). In contrast to the poverty of households with children, only 
children are counted in measures of child poverty. This can lead to differences between child poverty rates 
and family poverty rates in the same country. Children sometimes outnumber the adults per household, 
especially in households that face a high risk of poverty, that is, single-parent households or households 
with more than three children. 59. 
Furthermore, countries can evaluate child wellbeing by using a set of health indicators collected 
for babies and newborns. These measures are particularly important indicators of whether children have 
had a good start in life and thus had good opportunities for appropriate development. The most frequently 
used indicators in this context are infant mortality rates and low birth weights (see e.g., UNICEF, 2007). 60. 
With respect to indicators of child development, for older children, literacy scores at age nine and 
PISA scores can be assessed. Young adolescents are evaluated according to their school performance. 
PISA scores enable countries to assess the quality and performance of their educational system. Moreover, 
equality of opportunity means making a high-quality education equally accessible to all children. 
Furthermore, the transition from education to working life has become difficult in recent times. The high 
proportion of young people not in education in many countries illustrates the problems surrounding school-
to-work transitions. The percentage of young people not in education also makes it possible to infer 
possible social exclusion. It indicates that young adolescents lack relevant skills and qualifications to earn 
a living later in life. Thus, for the assessment of educational attainment, we report the percentage of young 
people not participating in education. For children under the compulsory school age, there are hardly 
any internationally comparable skill indicators available. Thus, no skill indicators could be assessed for 
these young age groups. Box 6. Indicators for core assessment: values, preferences and satisfaction @BULLET Childbearing preferences of childless women @BULLET Mean actual and ideal number of children @BULLET Reasons for not fulfilling stated childbearing desires @BULLET Life satisfaction 61. 
Apart from more objective indicators, a successful assessment of family policies should take 
subjective indicators into account as well. Values, preferences and life satisfaction indicators should be 
assessed as context indicators in the short run and outcome measures in the long run. 62. 
In addition to women's higher take-up of education and increasing participation in the labour 
market, another factor contributing to the decline in fertility rates is also believed to be changes in 
women's values and attitudes towards childbearing and gender roles (Gilbert, 2005; Hakim, 2003). Here, 
we propose assessing the childbearing preferences of childless women. 63. 
Often, however, there is discrepancy between the number of children that women want to have 
and their actual childbearing behaviour. This indicates that women (and men) face difficulties fulfilling 
their ideals for family life or for a balance between work and family life. Here, we propose using the 5 The same caveats we refer to in the context of family poverty also apply to child poverty. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 27 difference between the mean actual and ideal number of children and some of the associated reasons 
for not fulfilling stated childbearing desires. 64. 
In order to assess subjective wellbeing, countries should use the mean of life satisfaction as an 
important overall indicator for the wellbeing of all the individuals in a family. For an extended assessment 
of the subjective wellbeing of family members, the indicator satisfaction with family life could be used. 
This indicator is reported in EurLIFE, 6 a database on the quality of life in Europe. It offers data from the 
European Foundation's own surveys and from other published sources. The indicator on satisfaction with 
family life measures how content each family member is with his or her family life. 4.2 
Assessment of Country Differences 65. 
In Tables 1 to 5, we present an overview of available indicators for the five context/outcome 
categories discussed above: demography; parental labour market position; gender equality; child outcomes; 
and values, preferences and life satisfaction. 66. 
In general, information is available for all countries, but this differs from indicator to indicator. 
Hence, we discuss OECD and EU averages of the individual indicators referring to averages computed on 
the basis of different sample sizes. 67. 
Indicators depicting the demographic situation are presented in Table 1. In regard to average life 
span, life expectancy at birth for men and women in total is slightly higher on average among the OECD 
countries, at 78.2 years, than in the EU-27, at 77.1 years. Among the countries in the study, the lowest 
average life expectancy is found in Greece, with 69.5 years, and highest in Japan, at 82.1 years. The OECD 
countries listed are widely distributed across the three SD-groups (SD stands for Standard Deviation), with 
no particular regional clustering. The countries above the high SD, at 79.2, include the UK, Australia, New 
Zealand and Korea, whereas the middle SD contains mainly Scandinavian and eastern European countries. 
The low SD, at 72 years, includes most of southern Europe together with various countries from other parts 
of Europe. 68. 
The total fertility rate in the OECD countries is 1.64 children per woman overall and 1.51 in the 
EU-27. The only two countries above the fertility replacement level, at 2.1, are Turkey at 2.19 and Mexico 
at 2.2. Asia, most of the East European countries, and the southern European countries fell in the low SD 
group at 1.43. The western European countries are spread across all three SD groups, with Germany, for 
example, at 1.32 in the low SD, and France in the high SD at 1.74. The northern European countries are all 
to be found in the high SD, together with Australia, New Zealand, the US and the UK. 69. 
The percentage of births outside marriage as a share of all births varies significantly, with 
Korea having the lowest percentage (1.3%) and Iceland the highest (65.6%). All southern European 
countries placed below the EU-27 average of 34.4%, whereas all northern European countries placed 
above, except Ireland at 33.2% and Lithuania at 29.6%. The average among the OECD countries is 33%. 70. 
The teenage birth rate has an OECD average of 14.4 per 1 000 births. Countries with low 
teenage birth rates are the Asian countries, Italy and the western European countries. The high SD group 
includes New Zealand, United Kingdom and the two deviating countries Turkey, with 41.4, and the US, 
with 50.3. 6 http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eurlife/index.php DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 28 71. 
Average household size varies, with the lowest found in Latvia (one person on average) and the 
highest in Turkey (4.1 persons on average). Across the EU-27 countries, average household size is 2.5 
persons per household and is slightly higher among OECD countries, at 2.6. 72. 
The OECD average for households with no children as a percentage of all households is 64.5%, 
and the EU-27 average is 64.6%. In the high SD at 69% are mainly western and northern European 
countries. In the low SD, which is defined at 60%, we find southern and eastern European countries, 
including Ireland, which is isolated at 45%. A number of countries do not, however, have data for this 
indicator. 73. 
The OECD average for the mean age for women at first birth was 27.8 years, with an EU-27 
average of 27.4 years. In the low SD group, at 26.4 years, we find mainly eastern European countries, the 
Baltic countries plus the US, Ireland and Iceland. The Netherlands has the lowest mean age at 21.3 years. 
The western and northern European countries place in the middle and high SD group, which ranges from 
27 to 28 years. In these two SD groups, we also find Asia and New Zealand, the latter having the highest 
mean age at 30.7 years. 74. 
The OECD average for lone-parent households as a proportion of all households with 
children is 15.4%, with a somewhat lower figure for the EU-27, at 12.1%. In the low SD group, at 11% of 
all households, we find all of the southern European countries for which data is available, with the lowest 
proportion found in Greece at 5%. The US, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are in the 
high SD group. 75. 
Indicators depicting parental labour market and income positions are presented in Table 2. 
Employment rates of women with children aged 0-16 are on average 61.6% among the OECD countries. 
The average labour-market participation of mothers is slightly lower among the EU-27 (59.5%). For new 
EU members, information is only available for Slovakia (48.4%) and the Czech Republic (52.8%). 76. 
Part-time and full-time employment rates are stated for men and women separately. Most men 
work full-time, and the averages of the OECD and EU-27 countries are nearly the same. Among the OECD 
countries, 96.2% of males are employed full-time (in the EU 96.4%), whereas only 7.2% of men are 
employed part-time in the OECD member states (6.3% for the EU-27). The employment rates for women 
differ, as the full-time employment rate on average is above 60% in both country groupings. Female full-
time employment averages 77.1% in the OECD countries, and is slightly higher in the European countries 
(78.1%). Part-time employment rates of women are, on average, three times higher than for male 
employees. In Europe, 24.1% of women are employed part-time, while the OECD countries average 
25.6%. Yet male part-time employment is not below 10% in all countries. The Netherlands report 16.2% of 
total male employment as part-time work, and in Norway (11.2%) and Australia (12.4%) large percentages 
of men also work part-time. 77. 
Concerning statutory working hours, the maximum working time per week comes to 44.4 hours 
in the OECD countries and 44.1 hours in the European countries. This indicates that working time is 
regulated similarly among all countries covered in the tables. With respect to working time assessments, 
collectively agreed working time is considered in our table, given the widespread use of collective 
bargaining in Europe. The collectively agreed number of working hours per week is the same for both 
country groupings. In Europe, the average working week is 38.2 hours, and in the OECD countries it is 
38.3 hours. 78. 
Statutory rights relate only to the maximum number of working hours per week, but do not 
account for how many hours employees actually do work – or would like to work. Therefore, we also state 
differences between preferred and actual hours by gender. This sample, however, is only available for the DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 29 EU-15, and hence the OECD average could only be computed for its European members. Thus, we discuss 
only European averages for the indicators of actual and preferred time allocations. The average current 
number of working hours for men with children is 42.5 hours per week, which reflects that the majority of 
men work full-time. The average current number of working hours for women with children is 32.5 hours a 
week. Men would prefer to reduce their number of working hours by a greater amount than women. Men 
prefer a working time of 36.9 hours per week on average, whereas women prefer 29.3 hours per week. 79. 
Table 2 also reports poverty rates for households with children for all countries, as parental 
income is one indicator of child wellbeing. Family poverty rates are available for all OECD member states, 
and only eight countries are not included in our sample. The OECD average is 10.6%, indicating that 11% 
of all households with children and a working household head face poverty. For the European countries, 
family poverty is slightly below the OECD average at 9.9%. In Mexico and Poland, the family poverty rate 
is 19%. In Turkey it is as high as 20%. 80. 
Indicators that permit assessment of gender equality among the countries are stated in Table 3. 
Here, we report two indicators of a gender wage gap. The European source only reports data on the 
EU-24. We therefore discuss the OECD average reported by the OECD database and the EU average taken 
from the European source. On average, the gender wage gap in the OECD countries amounts to 18.8%. For 
Europe, the gender wage gap averages 14.5%. 7 For the OECD countries, the gender wage gap indicates a 
high gender inequity in Japan (33%) and Korea (38%), whereas in Europe, Germany (22%) and Slovakia 
(22%) are more discriminatory in terms of gender payment than other EU member states such as Belgium 
(7%). Another indicator referring to gender equality is the gender gap in employment. It indicates 
percentage point differences between male and female employment rates for people of the same age group. 
The OECD countries' gender gap in employment averages 18.6%, whereas in Europe it adds up to 16.8%. 
Here, southern Mediterranean countries such as Greece (32%) and Turkey (51%) stand out. 81. 
In Table 4 we depict different indicators related to child outcomes. In addition to family poverty, 
we also report child poverty. On average, child poverty is higher than family poverty in all countries. In 
the OECD countries, child poverty averages 12.4%, whereas in Europe the average is 11.4%. And in many 
countries, child poverty is even worse: the highest rates are found in Turkey (24.6%) and in Mexico 
(22.2%). Yet, among the developed western countries, US child poverty rates are extremely high, with 
20.6% of all children living in households below the poverty line. 82. 
Furthermore, Table 4 reports a number of health indicators that can be used to assess child 
outcomes. Particularly for young children, health measures are important as they indicate whether children 
have good chances of healthy development. The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths during the 
first year of a child's life expressed per 1 000 live births. On average, 5.5 deaths per 1 000 live births occur 
in the OECD countries, whereas in Europe the average amounts to 4.3 deaths. Infant mortality rates are the 
highest in Turkey (23.6 deaths) and Mexico (18.8 deaths), but in the US infant mortality rates are also 
relatively high at 6.8 deaths per 1 000 live births. 83. 
Low birth weight is also reported as a health indicator in Table 4. Among the OECD and 
European countries, 6.5% of newborns weigh less than 2 500 grams. Low birth weight rates range up to a 
high of 8.9% in Iceland and 8.8% in Greece. 84. 
Finally, child outcomes can also be assessed by educational indicators. For this purpose, we 
discuss the percentage of young people not in education by gender as well as the PISA scores for each 
country. Only 6.9% of young males are not in education in the OECD countries, and about 6.3% in Europe. 
For young females, the average among the OECD members is higher than for males, given the high 7 Please note that the difference might be caused by different sample sizes and sources. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 30 percentage of young women not enrolled in education in countries such as Turkey (47.1%). The average 
percentage of young females not participating in the educational system is 8.5% in the OECD countries 
and about 6.3% in Europe. PISA scores range from 410 (Mexico) to 563 (Finland). The averages between 
OECD and European countries are quite close. PISA scores average 499 points for the OECD states and an 
average of 497 points among the EU member states. 85. 
The indicators reported in Table 5 enable countries to assess values, preferences and life 
satisfaction. 86. 
In regard to the childbearing preferences of childless women between the ages of 15 and 39, on 
average 12.3% of these women in the OECD countries and 9.6% in the EU-27 countries state that they 
have no desire to have children. The proportion is lowest in Iceland, where virtually all childless women 
express a desire to have children at some point in their lives, and highest in Finland, where 20% of 
childless women have no desire to have children. 87. 
Among all women – both with and without children – there exists a discrepancy between the 
desired number of children and the actual number of children that these women give birth to when they are 
of childbearing age (15-55) . The highest difference is found in Cyprus, where women generally want to 
have 1.1 more children than they actually have during their fertile years, and lowest in Malta at 0.36 and 
Turkey at 0.37. Thus, in the latter countries, women are closer to achieving their desired number of 
children. Among the OECD and EU-27 countries, there is an average discrepancy of 0.65. 88. 
Finally, women aged 25-55+ who had not fulfilled the childbearing desires they had had at the 
age of 20 were asked about the reasons for this. Across the OECD and EU-27 countries, 6.3% and 7.9%, 
respectively, cited financial problems within the couple, while a similar proportion (5.7% average across 
the OECD countries and 6% across the EU-27 countries) cited problems combining work and family life. It 
seems that women, especially in Greece (28%), find it difficult for financial reasons to fulfil their 
childbearing desires, while this is less the case in countries such as Denmark, Sweden, the UK and Ireland 
(all 1%), and Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium (all 2%). Among the countries with the 
highest proportion of women who mention difficulties combining work and family life as a reason for not 
fulfilling childbearing desires, we find countries such as Bulgaria (13%), Slovakia, Belgium, Greece and 
Austria (all 11%). 89. 
Subjective wellbeing can be assessed by looking at the mean of life satisfaction. Life 
satisfaction is evaluated by means of a scale ranging from 1  " very dissatisfied "  to 10  " very satisfied " . The 
reported mean per country depicts the average answer on this scale. We report two different sources of life 
satisfaction data. The European source provides an average among the EU-27 member states of 6.9. This 
indicates that on average, people usually evaluate their personal life satisfaction as 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. 
The missing OECD countries that are not members of the EU show a slightly higher average value on this 
satisfaction scale, with 7.5. In addition to life satisfaction, European countries can also consider the 
satisfaction with family life. Here, the European average is 7.8. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 31 Table 1. Demography Life expectancy at

Selection of Indicators 90. 
For a family with a newborn or newly adopted child, some of the most important family policies 
are those that offer the possibility to take time off work to care for the child. This chapter will present the 
main indicators to consider when assessing leave schemes for families with infants or young children. 
These are grouped under the themes of time and money available for parents to care for their child, social 
investment in leave schemes in terms of expenditure, the actual use of parental leave, and finally, issues 
relating to gender equality (see Box 7). Box 7. Indicators for core assessment: leave schemes @BULLET

Gender equality 91. 
The provision of leave is intended to protect the mother before birth and allow her to recover 
fully (physically and mentally) immediately following birth. It is also provided in recognition of the child's 
needs to be nurtured and to establish a close relationship with both parents. Some studies from the US 
suggest that full-time maternal employment during the first year of a child's life may affect the child 
negatively in terms of its development (e.g., Waldfogel et al., 2002), for example, due to negative effects 
on breastfeeding and the child's general health conditions (Berger et al., 2005). Leave policies also 
recognise the father's needs to bond with the child, and support the equal division of childcare between 
men and women from a gender equality point of view. 92. 
Existing leave schemes cover a period of time in which parents can take off work, and in most 
countries also include cash benefits as compensation for lost wages. The leave schemes included here are: 93. 
Maternity leave is a period of job-protected leave for the employed woman, generally to be taken 
during the last weeks prior to birth and the weeks following birth (or adoption in some countries). It is 
intended to offer the mother and the unborn child rest before birth, and to allow the mother to recover and 
spend time with the newborn after birth. Only in special circumstances such as serious illness of the mother 
or the mother's death may the right to maternity leave be transferred to the father. Most countries provide 
financial support to mothers on maternity leave. 94. 
Paternity leave is job-protected leave provided to the employed father, normally to be taken near 
the time of childbirth in order for him to spend time with his newborn and offer support to the mother and 
other children in the home. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 37 95. 
Parental leave is job-protected term leave provided to enable parents to care for their child, 
normally during the first years of childhood. The right to take leave is individual and available to the 
mother and the father, who decide which one will make use of the leave. Sometimes, a certain period is set 
aside for the parent who is not on leave as an individual, non-transferable right – the so-called  " father 
quotas "  often introduced to encourage fathers to take leave. Entitlement to public income support during 
leave is often family-based, giving one parent at a time entitlement to claim the benefit. Social expenditure 96. 
As a first indicator for parental leave for an assessment of family policy, we suggest social 
expenditure on leave schemes as a percentage of GDP. This provides an overview of public social 
investments in leave schemes. In combination with the indicator on social expenditure for daycare and 
educational services for children as a percentage of GDP presented in Chapter 5.2, it may indicate whether 
countries emphasise daycare/educational services for children or leave benefits. A more sophisticated 
indicator is, however, the indicator social expenditure for maternity and parental leave payments per 
child born, as a percentage of GDP. This indicator combines the expenditure on leave schemes with the 
actual number of children being born, and thus takes into account cross-national differences in birth rates. Length of leave 97. 
Another important indicator when assessing leave policies is the number of weeks available to 
the parents. This is reported here as the numbers of weeks of maternity, paternity and parental leave 
available in each country. The length of leave varies between countries and has varied over the years 
according to cultural norms about good parenthood and childhood. Maternity leave is defined by the ILO 
as at least 14 weeks, some of which may be stipulated to be taken before birth. Not all countries provide 
paternity leave, and of those that do, two weeks is the most common. In the table on indicators, a special 
period of time set aside for the father, the so-called  " father quota " , is, however, included under paternity 
leave although it is actually part of parental leave (and the amount may thus differ substantially from the 
amount of paternity leave payments). Some countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic have for a 
number of years provided relatively long parental leave up to the child's third year, for example, while 
others such as Denmark have provided relatively short leave up to age one because of the imperative that 
women return quickly to the labour market. 98. 
With the introduction of new parental leave schemes and the increased number of weeks now 
available, a frequently debated issue is how leave take-up affects women's careers, especially since women 
use the majority of weeks available. Opponents of long leave schemes argue that they have an adverse 
effect on women's careers and lifetime earnings. They attribute some of the gender wage gap to women's 
more frequent use of parental leave (Pylkänen and Smith, 2003), and it is argued that employers may be 
more reluctant to hire women in some sectors because of generous leave schemes (Fagnani, 1999). The 
(unresolved) question is what the turnaround point is where the length of leave shifts from strengthening 
women's labour market positions to weakening them, that is, when a leave period actually becomes too 
long. Swedish studies, for example, suggest that 12 months of parental leave seem to have no negative 
effect on women's wages (Albrecht et al,. 1999). 99. 
Some studies have claimed that long parental leave can disadvantage the child as well. It has 
been argued, for example, that the availability of long leave periods further disadvantages children born 
into dysfunctional families or to second-language parents, as these children are considered to benefit more 
in terms of socio-emotional development or language skills from participating in daycare programmes 
(Bennett, 2008). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 38 Payment during leave 100. 
The leave schemes provided may just provide a period away from the labour market, or they may 
include payments to compensate for the loss of income during the leave period. A paid leave scheme 
would be more attractive to parents, and the provision of a relatively high compensation rate would ensure 
that more fathers make use of the scheme, since their earnings often make an important contribution to the 
family budget. It is worth noting that local authorities may provide supplements to the statutory leave 
benefit that make the leave scheme even more attractive. 101. 
In some cases, the entitlement to leave and to a benefit may be separate, as is the case in the 
Finnish child care leave scheme and the benefit scheme, and full take-up of these forms of leave therefore 
depends on approval from the employer. Take-up rates will invariably reflect whether a benefit is paid or 
unpaid, and any comparison of schemes must take these factors into account. Here, we suggest using the 
compensation rate as given for an Average Worker (AW) working full-time. 102. 
To understand the interplay between leave length and compensation rate, a calculation of 
 " effective leave "  is provided, while taking into account that the entitlement to several weeks of leave is 
most useful if accompanied by a sufficiently large benefit. The effective leave is computed by weighting 
the duration of the length of parental leave by the level of payment, that is, weeks are multiplied by the % 
payment benefit in FTE (full-time equivalent) payments (Gornick and Meyers, 2003; Plantenga and Siegel, 
2004; Moss and Wall, 2007). Countries may thus provide a generous period of leave, but if it is not 
accompanied by a good compensation rate, the indicator will accordingly have a low numerical value. 
Thus, 40 weeks with a wage replacement of 100% has a coefficient of 40, and at a wage replacement of 
50%, a coefficient of 20. Use of leave 103. 
Any national assessment of leave take-up should take two key issues into account: whether 
parents are eligible to take leave, and how many eligible parents actually do take leave. Data on eligibility 
are, however, rarely comparable, as they depend on national surveys with variations in question wording 
(OECD, 2008). Take-up rates can therefore not be calculated, and the comparable data can only report the 
use of leave. Using data from the European Labour Force Survey (ELFS), we provide an indicator of 
paternal and maternal leave take-up. The indicator covers the proportion of employed parents with a 
child under the age of one on leave. An approach to fine-tuning this indicator has been suggested by 
Brunning and Plantenga (1999), who advocate calculating user rates instead, which is the average number 
of parents with children on leave divided by the average number of working parents with children. Gender issues 104. 
Finally, we suggest using a weighted gender equality index indicator, which summarises how 
national leave policies have incorporated issues of gender equality. The indicator consists of a fifteen-point 
scale, with nine possible points for the portion of leave available to fathers or provided exclusively to 
fathers, five possible points for the level of wage replacement during leave, and one possible point 
(positive or negative) for incentives for fathers to either take their permitted leave or transfer it to the 
mother (Ray et al., 2008). Scoring high on this indicator is an expression of full equality in workplace and 
care-giving benefits for men and women. The value of the total index indicator is given in the table, as are 
disaggregated indicator values. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 39 5.2 
Assessment of Country Differences 105. 
In Table 6 the values for the various indicators are reported. In regard to public expenditure on 
maternity leave, on average countries spend 0.3% of GDP for leave payments, with the highest proportion 
being spent in Hungary (0.8%). If expenditures on leave schemes are calculated as expenditure per child 
as a percentage of GDP per capita, the EU-27 countries spend on average 31% and the OECD countries 
27.4%. Hungary spends the highest proportion (83%) and Korea the lowest (0.1%). 106. 
In regard to leave length, maternity leave is longest in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (28 
weeks) and shortest in Norway (9 weeks). On average, mothers in the EU countries have 17.7 weeks 
available and in the OECD countries 16.1 weeks. Of the countries that provide paternity leave, the longest 
leave is available in Iceland (13 weeks), as this includes the fathers' quotas in the parental leave, and the 
shortest in Austria, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain, which each award less than 
one week. On average, fathers in the EU countries have 1.9 weeks of paternity leave available and in the 
OECD countries 2.8 weeks, taking into account fathers' quotas. Parental periods vary from 12 weeks 
(Belgium and Italy) to 156 weeks (Poland, France the Czech Republic and Slovakia), with an EU average 
of 82.4 weeks and an OECD average of 69.4 weeks. 107. 
In regard to the effective leave, which takes into account both the length and the compensation 
paid, the most generous system is found in Norway, where relatively long periods of leave are 
accompanied by a high compensation rate (100%) and the least generous in Australia, where the only leave 
available – parental leave – is unpaid. On average, the effective leave is reported to be 45.4 in EU and 37.1 
in the OECD countries; that is, slightly more generous leave schemes are found in the EU. 108. 
A number of countries provide 100% of an Average Production Worker's (AW) salary in 
compensation during maternity leave. The lowest compensation rate reported is in the UK (46.2%). Most 
countries also provide 100% of an AW's salary in compensation during paternity leave. Exceptions are the 
UK, where compensation rates are as low as 25%. On average, compensation rates for paternity leave are 
93.9% in the EU and 92.3% in the OECD countries. Compensation rates during parental leave are lower 
than during maternity or paternity leave. The highest compensation rate is provided in Norway (100%) and 
the lowest in Germany (11%). Across the EU countries, the average compensation rate during parental 
leave is 39.9%, and across the OECD countries 45.3%. 109. 
In relation to gender equality, Sweden scores highest (12 points), indicating that gender equality 
is highest there, when paternity leave, paternity compensation and policy incentives to encourage paternal 
caregiving are taken together, and Switzerland scores lowest. The EU countries reported under the gender 
equality index score on average 9.6 in comparison to the OECD countries, with the score 8.4. 110. 
Use of leave by mothers is highest in Slovenia, where 87.2% of women with children under the 
age of one were reported to be on leave, and lowest in the UK, with 0.6%. Among the men, in many 
countries no men are reported to be on leave. The highest proportion of men reported to be on leave is in 
Romania, with 6.2%. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 40 Table 6. Maternity, paternity and parental leave Thereof:

The provision of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) has received increasing attention 
during recent years, and it has been acknowledged that the provision of good ECEC services is of major 
importance for child development – both in social life as well as in education. Research in neuroscience, 
for example, studies of the effect of children's participation in high-quality ECEC programmes on early 
brain development, has heightened governments' interest in providing such programmes as part of life-
long learning initiatives (Myers, 2000; Bennett, 2008). Children who participate in kindergarten or pre-
school education achieve better results on the OECD PISA study (Bennet, 2008). Of equal importance, as 
mentioned in Chapter 2, ECEC provision has been recognised as a means of increasing the participation of 
women in the labour market. Furthermore, the provision of ECEC services has been found to relate to the 
rate of fertility. According to Blau and Robins (1998; 1989), for example, countries with a high availability 
of public childcare also show relatively high fertility rates. 6.1 
Selection of Indicators 112. 
Merely having a high enrolment rate in ECEC services is not, however, sufficient to ensure 
children the best opportunities and allow parents to participate to the desired extent in the labour market. 
Other issues are important as well, such as the quality of ECEC provision and the affordability of the 
services to parents. This chapter will provide an overview of indicators that are related to universalism, 
affordability and the quality of services. Box 8. Indicators for core assessment: ECEC @BULLET Formal entitlement to daycare @BULLET Enrolment rate in daycare and educational services, percentage of children 0-2 and 3-6 @BULLET Children attending full-time childcare as a percentage of overall provision @BULLET Opening hours @BULLET Social expenditure on ECEC as a percentage of GDP @BULLET Public share of expenditure @BULLET Childcare costs for dual-earner families @BULLET Child/staff ratio @BULLET 80% or more staff members have received training @BULLET 50% or more staff members have finished tertiary education Universalism 113. 
The  " universalism "  of ECEC provision applies first of all to the availability of daycare to all 
children. This may be measured as the proportion of children in ECEC programmes for a given age group. 
ECEC may include services for children under school age; for example, according to the OECD definition 
(2001: 14), ECEC includes  " …all arrangements providing care and education for children under 
compulsory school age, regardless of setting, funding, opening hours, or programme content "  (p. 14). 
Eurostat's (2004) definition, on the other hand, includes arrangements for older children and socialisation: 
 " any arrangement for children aged 0 to 12 outside compulsory school involving elements of physical care, 
socialisation and/or education " . This would include the provision of after-school care, which is lacking in 
many countries and which means that many parents have problems if both want to hold a full-time job (the DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 42 OECD Family Database includes information on Out-of-School-Hours Care, but data is not comparable, as 
age groupings vary across countries). 114. 
In the OECD approach, the focus is on all organised ECEC provision  " in centres and in group 
settings (including schools) and family daycare (individuals who provide care to non-related children in the 
carer's home) "  (OECD, 2001: 15), and this is the approach followed here as well. 115. 
The term ECEC originates from the term Early Childhood Development (ECD), which 
emphasises a holistic approach to the child's physical, emotional, social and cognitive development. In 
contrast, ECEC places the emphasis on care affecting development and learning. Another commonly used 
name, Early Childhood Education (ECE) is favoured by educational authorities, who wish to emphasise 
the learning aspect, and is used especially in the US (White, 2002). 116. 
Here, we will use the OECD definition of ECEC and include arrangements providing care and/or 
educational services for children aged 0-6, as this is the generally agreed cut-off point in many statistical 
accounts. This was also the convention used originally by the European Commission Childcare Network, 
which was then followed in the OECD Starting Strong reviews (Bennett, 2008), and in the formulation of 
the Barcelona targets for formal childcare capacity. This does not, however, take into account that children 
may start in primary school earlier, for example, in the Netherlands, where it is common for children to 
start school at the age of four. 117. 
ECEC provisions may thus include arrangements for education and/or childcare. Across 
countries, there are institutional differences in how ECEC provisions were initially established and for 
what purpose. In some, such as the Nordic countries, ECEC arrangements were initially set up to provide 
care for the entire age group from birth to compulsory school age during the times when parents were at 
work. In other countries, such as Germany, ECEC provisions originally reflected the objective of offering 
educational or pedagogical provision to children aged three and over before they entered primary school. A 
certain adaptation has taken place, especially following the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. This 
reflects the desire to tap the female labour reserve, as mentioned in Chapter 2, but the institutional design 
of services for young children still in many ways also reflects this fundamental difference in objectives in 
terms of funding, organisation and provision. Arrangements included under ECEC services may thus vary 
and be termed  " daycare centre "  in one country and  " nursery school "  in another, although both serve the 
same age groups. Family daycare is another way of providing for children, and in some countries, play 
groups offer part-time care for children without parental supervision. 118. 
ECEC services also differ from one country to the next in whether they are under the auspices of 
the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Welfare. Until recently, comparative analyses of daycare 
services concentrated mainly on educational services for children three and over, where some similarity 
across systems could be found. This, however, led to underestimating provisions for the under-three-year-
olds – for whom extensive services are provided in the Nordic countries, for instance – and also ignored 
services provided under the Ministries of Welfare. Today, most comparative indicators also take into 
account provisions under the auspices of these Ministries. 119. 
With the recent emphasis on the educational advantages of participating in ECEC, there is a new 
focus on ensuring educational equity by providing daycare to all children, especially on children at risk of 
educational failure (Bennett, 2008). The OECD national reviews of daycare in the Starting Strong project 
showed that it was particularly children with special or additional educational needs – children with 
disabilities, from disadvantaged backgrounds, or from ethnic or cultural minorities – who did not have 
access to these services (Leseman, 2002). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 43 120. 
Some countries have introduced legal entitlements to daycare; most of these guarantee daycare 
services to children over the age of three, but some of the Nordic countries also provide these services to 
children under three. The first indicator of universalism in the report is whether or not children aged 0-2 
and 3-6 are offered a formal entitlement to daycare. A guarantee of service provision does not, however, 
mean that adequate services are actually available: there may, for example, be long waiting lists to get into 
daycare programmes. 121. 
Most countries have, however, experienced enormous growth in daycare provision in the last 20 
years. Among the EU countries, where the Barcelona targets of 33% for 0-2 and 90% for 3-6 by 2010 have 
set new standards, this growth has been especially rapid. Most EU countries provide for more or less all 
children aged 3-6, and some components of these services are in pre-primary education, which prepares 
children for schooling. There has also been an increase in the proportion of children in the 0-2 age group 
using daycare services. In this report, we use the indicator enrolment in daycare and educational 
services for children, which encompasses arrangements under welfare as well as educational authorities, 
and private as well as public services. It should be noted that some countries may not register arrangements 
such as family daycare, which means actual provision may be higher. Also, many forms of private daycare 
provision are not included, whether they are non-profit or for-profit, as is the case in Australia, Canada, 
Ireland, Mexico and the US, where a significant portion of childcare is provided privately or through 
informal channels (OECD, 2008a). Also workplace-provided daycare may not be included in the registers. 
In Chapter 5.4, daycare provided by employers is considered. 122. 
Most countries differentiate between services for children aged 0-2 and for children between the 
age of three and school age, though there are many exceptions. For example, in France, crèches parentales 
are provided for children 0-3 years of age, and in Italy, scuola materna is for children aged 3-6. Here, we 
use enrolment for the 0-2 and 3-6 age groups, but actual cut-off points may vary between the countries. 123. 
It is worth keeping in mind that enrolment rates do not reveal the number of places available in 
daycare programmes, but only the proportion of children using the services. Enrolment rates thus do not 
tell us whether demand has been met, which makes them a crude indicator of accessibility. Demand may 
also vary between countries and over time. Cultural norms regarding motherhood and parenthood affect the 
demand for daycare, as do levels of employment and unemployment. In addition, parental leave systems 
vary substantially between countries, offering great variation in the number of weeks that parents may stay 
home to care for the child. When interpreting enrolment rates, alternative ways of looking after children 
– especially very young children – must therefore be taken into consideration. Some countries do, 
however, take the parental system into account when calculating take-up rates and only report the 
proportion of children in ECEC following the end of the parental leave period. 124. 
The interpretation of enrolment rates is also complicated by the difference in hours provided. 
While services within the educational sector are mainly part-time, either a few hours every day or several 
hours on a few days with one or more days off per week, services within the welfare sector tend to be full-
time. Moreover, welfare services such as daycare centres and family daycare are mainly offered on a full-
year basis, whereas services within the educational sector are for the most part provided during term-time 
only. Again, there are institutional traditions as well as cultural norms behind the differences across 
countries, so full-time provision may seem more appropriate in some countries than others. Nevertheless, 
in regards to fulfilling the Barcelona targets, full-time provision may make it easier for families to combine 
work and family life. 125. 
In order to emphasise the differences across countries in full-time and part-time provision, an 
indicator showing the proportion of children attending full-time provision is included. This shows the 
proportion of children in full-time daycare of all the children attending daycare programmes. Again, this DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 44 does not reveal whether there is provision in accordance with the demand for ECEC services, or whether 
children are in either full-time or part-time care mainly because this is what is provided. 126. 
We also report  " daily coverage "  by providing an indicator of average opening hours in order to 
emphasise the variation across countries. This indicator is, however, based on the most commonly used 
daycare institutions (the form of daycare with the highest proportion of children attending) and does not 
take into account family daycare. Again, the average hours do not take into account whether there is ECEC 
provision for the majority of the year or only during the school term. Opening hours do not indicate the 
actual time that the child spends in daycare, merely the hours of care and education available to the child 
during the day. Long opening hours may of course enable parents to pursue work objectives, but may 
negatively affect children's relationships with their parents and reduce the amount of time they spend in a 
home setting. 127. 
Availability may also be measured as public investments in the provision of daycare services. 
Here, we report social expenditure on ECEC as a percentage of GDP. This is divided into expenditure 
for childcare (mainly 0-2 years) and pre-primary education (mainly 3-6 years) in order to emphasise where 
countries place their emphasis. Not all ECEC expenditure, especially when related to social welfare 
provision, is necessarily included, however. As reported by Bennett (2008), the data on expenditure taken 
from the OECD Social Expenditure Database is often lower than what was reported by the individual 
countries in 2004 to the Starting Strong reviews conducted by the OECD. He notes that there seems to be 
some underreporting, as expenditure levels were considerably higher in the Nordic countries in the OECD 
national reviews. Employers' investments in the financing of ECEC services – as is common in the 
Netherlands, for instance – may not be included in social expenditure data either. It is also worth keeping 
in mind that social expenditure levels will generally depend on the age of the child, as expenditure levels 
on younger children tend to be higher due to the higher number of staff members and also to cross-national 
variation in the calculation of fees, required child:staff ratios and staff training levels. In daycare 
programmes with a high ratio of staff members to children, and with staff members who have received 
tertiary education, for example, costs will be higher, given that the largest share of ECEC expenditure goes 
to staff wages. 128. 
Expenditure levels may nevertheless indicate public involvement in this field. We have thus 
included the public share of expenditure as an indicator. This indicator shows the proportion of 
expenditure that the public contributes, and thus indicates how much is left for the parents (or employer) to 
cover. Affordability 129. 
The financial burden of childcare plays an important part in parents' decisions about whether to 
participate in the labour market. Expensive services may prevent parents from using ECEC or even 
applying to such programmes. Correlations between childcare costs and fertility rates give some indication 
that high childcare costs may also affect decisions about whether to have a child, but this is modified to 
some degree by a high availability of daycare services (OECD, 2008a). 130. 
Countries may subsidise daycare provision, reduce costs for low-income or lone-parent families, 
or offer a sibling rebate to parents with more than one child. Tax reductions may also be provided so that 
working parents can reduce the costs of childcare. Tax breaks towards the costs of childcare are common 
in, for example, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK. 131. 
One indicator of the affordability of ECEC systems is the total of what childcare costs for a 
dual-earner family with earnings representing one full-time and one part-time earner (calculated DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 45 according to earnings for an Average Production Worker) would amount to for two participating children 
aged 2 and 3, after any tax reductions and childcare benefits. Quality 132. 
In addition to the cost of daycare, quality is likely to be an issue of importance for parents when 
they choose whether and where their child should be looked after. Quality can be measured in many ways, 
such as general satisfaction among parents or children with the provision of services, or the quality of the 
interaction between the child and teachers/daycare staff. Often, however, more quantifiable measures are 
used, such as the child:staff ratio, which outlines how many adults work with a given group of children. 
The child:staff ratio is calculated by dividing the number of full-time equivalent children enrolled in ECEC 
programmes by the number of full-time equivalent teachers/daycare staff. 133. 
The child:staff ratio should be seen in relation to age, as younger children need more care and 
attention and thus lower child:staff ratios. Often, however, age-differentiated statistics are not available. 
According to Fiene (2002), the preferred ratio for younger children aged 0-2 is three to four children per 
staff member in daycare centres, and a minimum of two staff members per group. For older children aged 
3-6, there should ideally be eight children per staff member. 134. 
Of concern when assessing the child:staff ratio is also the practice of registering staff members, 
that is, whether the director, kitchen and cleaning staff, and parent volunteers are included in the 
calculation of staff members. Preferably the ratios should be measured as full-time staff to the number of 
full-time daycare slots, and not the number of children attending the programme, but this is very rarely the 
case. Most often, child:staff ratios are reported only for the main institutional care arrangements and not 
for family daycare providers (see Rostgaard and Fridberg, 1998 for an exception). 135. 
Another important quality indicator in ECEC provision is the training level of staff. Good staff 
training can foster high-quality social care provision. The level of training is reported here as whether there 
are 80% or more of staff members who have received training. In addition, we have included an 
indicator that shows whether 50% or more staff members have finished tertiary education. Also 
relevant would be personal aptitude and work experience and the combinations of trained and untrained 
staff. 6.2 
Assessment of Country Differences 136. 
Tables 7 and 8 present the different indicators. Apart from Hungary, it is only the Nordic 
countries that provide entitlement to daycare for younger children aged 0-2. Norway does not, however, 
guarantee daycare to either the younger or the older children. A daycare guarantee for older children aged 
3-6 is more common, except in countries such as Australia, Austria, Canada, Korea and the US (other 
countries may or may not have a daycare guarantee, but no data is available). 137. 
Overall enrolment is 22.4% on average for children aged 0-2 in the OECD countries and 19.6% 
in the EU-27, and thus far from the Lisbon target of 33%. Several countries have, however, already 
reached the Lisbon target, including countries outside the EU such as Denmark (61.7%), Iceland (58.7%), 
Norway (43.7%), Sweden (39.5%), the US (35.5%) and Belgium (33.6%). For the older children, on 
average 77.6% in the EU-27 and 74% in the OECD countries are enrolled in daycare or pre-primary 
activities, with the highest rates in France and Italy (100%, note some over-reporting), but the Lisbon goal 
of 90% provision has also been met in Belgium (99.6%), Spain (98.6%), Iceland (94.7%) and New Zealand 
(92.7%). The lowest coverage is found in Turkey (10.5%). 138. 
The highest proportion of young children aged 0-2 attending full-time care is found in Poland 
and Lithuania (100%) and the lowest in the Netherlands. On average in the EU countries, 60.5% of young DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 46 children attend full-time care, slightly lower among the OECD countries (57.1%). Among the older 
children, aged 3-6, it is more common to attend full-time daycare. On average in the EU countries, 54.6% 
attend full-time and on average among the OECD countries, 58.4%. Full-time provision for the older 
children is lowest in the Netherlands (8%) and highest in Lithuania (93%). 139. 
The level of public expenditure on childcare provision mainly for 0-2-year-olds as a percentage 
of GDP is highest in Iceland (0.7%) and lowest in Mexico (at 0.0%). On average, the EU countries spend 
0.26% of GDP on childcare, and the OECD countries spend 0.27%. For pre-primary education, mainly for 
children aged 3-6, average levels are somewhat higher: 0.44% in the EU countries and 0.34% in the OECD 
countries. 140. 
Public funding for ECEC for 0-2 year-olds covers on average 82% of total costs in EU 
countries, that is, leaving 18% of costs to be covered by parents and/or employers, and also 82% in OECD 
countries. The public share is highest in Ireland (100%) and lowest in the Netherlands (64.5%). For older 
children, aged 3-6, the EU and the OECD average public funding both cover 94%. In many countries, 
public funding covers 100% of expenditure, with the lowest level covered by the public in Denmark 
(75%). 141. 
In Table 8, the average opening hours of the most commonly used daycare services are reported. 
These vary from seven hours per day (Spain) to 11.5 hours (in Sweden for younger children aged 0-2), 
with an EU and OECD average of 9.3. For older children, much provision is offered part-time, and opening 
hours for 3-6-year-olds vary from four hours per day (Greece and Ireland) to 11.5 hours (Sweden). 142. 
In daycare programmes, average child:staff ratios are in general higher for the younger children 
aged 0-2. They are lowest in Denmark, with 3.3 children per staff member, and highest in Australia, with 
7.5 children per staff member. For the countries reporting data for the age group 3-6, the highest number of 
children per staff member is found in Norway and the UK (8 children). For countries reporting only for the 
whole age group 0-6, the highest number of children per staff member is found in Portugal (11 children) 
and the lowest in the US (5 children). In pre-school programmes, the EU average is 13.8 children per staff 
member and the OECD average 14.8 children, being highest in Mexico (28.3 children) and lowest in 
Denmark (6.9 children). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 47 Table 7. Early childhood education and care Formal

This chapter explores possible methods of assessing the differences in the availability and 
generosity of family benefits in OECD and EU countries. Family benefits are understood as a means to 
compensate for the costs associated with rearing children. On the one hand, families face higher needs than 
other households. On the other, the earnings capacity (or labour supply) is restricted due to childcare 
obligations. Although the restrictions differ according to the design of the early childhood education and 
care system (see Section 5.1) and the prevalence of family-oriented policies on the employer or firm level 
(see Section 5.4), it is not likely that such policies fully level out the differences between families and other 
households. As a consequence, families with children are more economically vulnerable. In many 
countries, families with more than two children or lone-parent families face a higher poverty risk than 
other households. Family benefits can play a crucial role in limiting the economic disadvantages of 
families. If we assume a negative relationship between economic strain and child wellbeing, family 
benefits may help to better achieve this policy aim. Family benefits may also play an indirect role in 
balancing work and family life, as they reduce the need to be fully active in the labour market. 144. 
In general, we can distinguish between family cash allowances, family-related tax reductions, and 
family-related elements of the social insurance system. With regard to the latter, the main focus is on 
family-related reductions in employee social security contributions (for a discussion of other, more indirect 
aspects, such as family-related elements of the old-age pension system, see Dingeldey 2000). There are a 
number of approaches to capturing differences between countries in the availability and generosity of 
family benefits (for an overview, see Gauthier, 1999). Each of the approaches is characterised by its own 
advantages or disadvantages; each one alludes to specific features of the family benefit system and ignores 
others (see also Chapter 3). Therefore, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of family benefits in 
a large number of countries, it is necessary to combine evidence gathered using different approaches. We 
rely mainly on the expenditure approach and the model family approach, both of which we discuss in the 
following. 7.1 
General Approaches 145. 
The expenditure approach uses data on public social expenditure to assess a given country's 
welfare effort. Many of the classic studies on the welfare state are based on the expenditure approach 
(e.g., Wilensky, 1975). This approach is also used in studies with a specific focus on family policies, 
including family benefits (see, e.g., Pampel and Adams, 1992; Kamerman and Kahn, 1997; Guo and 
Gilbert, 2007). The expenditure approach has been criticised for various reasons (see Esping-Andersen, 
1990; Gauthier, 1999). First, expenditure data do not reveal whether a given level of expenditure is due to 
the provision of low benefits to a large share of the population (broad coverage) or to the provision of high 
benefits to a small share of the population (narrow coverage). Qualitative differences in the family benefit 
system that yield differential outcomes in terms of family wellbeing are not captured adequately. Second, 
internationally comparable expenditure data contain information about expenditure on broad categories of 
programmes rather than on individual measures. Some studies look at social expenditure on family policies 
in general, which includes expenditure on family benefits, parental leave policies and family services (see, 
e.g., Siaroff, 1994; Guo and Gilbert, 2007). The differential outcomes of different provisions of leave 
policies, benefits, or services from one country to the next cannot be evaluated based on such broad 
expenditure categories. However, the available expenditure data have become richer in detail, with the 
consequence that expenditure on family benefits can be analysed separately from other types of family DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 50 policy expenditure. A third objection, which is related to the second, is that – due to the complexity of 
expenditure data (which captures all types of social expenditure) – it is sometimes difficult to achieve full 
comparability between countries. Similar policies may fall into different fields of competence and be dealt 
with by different government agencies from one country to the next, and may thus be counted as different 
types of expenditure (e.g., care or education). 146. 
Despite these objections, which we will have to account for when we compare countries on the 
basis of such indicators, the expenditure approach has some distinct advantages. First, expenditure data is 
available for a large number of countries in highly standardised databases, which are updated on a regular 
basis and allow for broad cross-country comparisons. Second, expenditure data allow for a comprehensive 
overview, as all types of expenditure on family policy are included. However, the inclusion of information 
on tax reductions as a third type of family expenditure has not yet been fully implemented. The OECD has 
systematically begun to include such information (see OECD, 2007). However, up to now, these data are 
not available for all countries, and there is some unclarity about how the issue is handled in the other 
databases. 147. 
While the expenditure approach is most useful to provide a broad overview of the family-related 
welfare effort of a given country, the model family approach aims at providing information about the level 
and structure of benefits at the individual level. The basic idea is to calculate the size of the benefit 
package for a number of family types that differ, for instance, in the level of earnings and the number and 
age of the children. In addition, most studies differentiate between lone parents and couples. The approach 
allows for the inclusion of all aspects of the tax-benefit system, such as tax reductions, family-related 
components of the social insurance system, family allowances, housing benefits and social assistance 
payments (see, e.g., Bradshaw and Finch, 2002). This approach is illustrative, as it provides information on 
the level of individual types of benefits at the family level and not at a highly aggregated level. However, 
the computation of the family benefit package on a wide range of model families is demanding, as it 
requires detailed knowledge of a country's tax-benefit system. Therefore, all studies rely on networks of 
country experts to provide the necessary information. This often works as a restriction on the number of 
countries included. But compared to earlier studies (see, e.g., Bradshaw and Piachaud, 1980), more recent 
studies have gained in terms of the number of countries covered (Bradshaw and Finch, 2002; Bradshaw, 
2006; OECD, 2007). Still, the information is available for individual years or a few years only, and is not 
– like expenditure data – updated on a regular basis, which means that the indicators may soon be outdated. 
Bradshaw (2006) looks at changes in the family benefit package from 2001 to 2004. However, the 
comparison is based on a small sample of countries, and it is unclear whether Jonathan Bradshaw or other 
researchers will prepare further updates. The OECD tax-benefit models could provide a basis for 
continuous reporting of such indicators. However, the respective indicators are not included in the OECD 
Family Database. 8 148. 
A second criticism refers to the problem that the results on the various model families cannot be 
generalised at a population level. Every study can provide information on a selected range of model 
families only, which does not allow for generalisation to families of different sizes, structures and earnings. 
Since the share of these  " other "  family types differs between countries, the model families will represent a 
smaller or larger share of the population in each country. Hence, depending on the choice of model 
families, the approach may yield different results for the same country. Furthermore, the method has the 
disadvantage of producing numerous different indicators. This is not a disadvantage per se, as it reflects the 
variation in the family benefit package by family type. But to allow for easy comparisons, some studies 
(see, e.g., Bradshaw et al., 1993) also provide average values over all family types. However, as these 8 Instead, the Family Database provides a detailed description of the child benefit systems (indicator PF3) 
including information on the level of benefits, variation by family size, age of children and aspects of 
means-testing. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 51 averaged values are usually not weighted by the prevalence of a given family type, and the range of model 
families does not cover all families in a given country, such indicators do not provide a representative 
estimation of the average family package in a given country. A third issue has been raised as a 
disadvantage, but it can be read as an advantage as well. The approach is based on a mere description of 
the tax-benefit system and does not reflect the level of benefits families actually receive (Gauthier, 1999: 
45). In the case of non-take-up of benefits, the model family approach will overestimate the impact of 
family policy on problems such as child poverty. However, this can also be regarded as a strong point of 
the approach, as it provides a full picture of the policy framework and allows for analyses that are able to 
differentiate between policy effects and family behaviour. 9 In providing instructive results on how different 
policies (are intended to) affect the economic situation of a broad range of family types, the model family 
approach convincingly complements the representative but unspecific perspective of the expenditure 
approach. Therefore, an evaluation of family benefits needs to take into account both perspectives. 149. 
Although the combination of both approaches already provides a detailed overview of country 
differences in the field of family benefits, information from a third source may be added. As described 
above, the model family approach provides information at the policy level, while it cannot take into 
account the actual payment of transfers. The expenditure approach reflects the payment of transfers at a 
highly aggregated level only. Comparative micro-data on income, such as the Luxembourg Income Study 
(LIS) or the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), allow for the assessment of the 
impact of family benefits at the household level. These databases provide detailed information on the 
income package of households. Thus, family benefits can be separated from other types of income, and this 
information can be used to calculate the average value of family benefits or their share of total family 
income. Such databases allow not only for an evaluation of the size of benefits but also for detailed 
analyses of the distributional impact of such measures. Therefore, such data are usually provided in studies 
on poverty or the income distribution (see, e.g., Whiteford and Adema, 2007). However, respective 
indicators have also been included in studies on family policy (Gornick and Meyers, 2001) and in the 
OECD Family Database. 10 7.2 
Selection of Indicators 150. 
As in the previous chapters, we provide an overview on the country differences on the basis of a 
selection of the available indicators. We suggest a combination of evidence from expenditure data and 
from indicators derived from the model family approach. The core assessment looks at four main areas: 
(1) the level of public expenditure on cash family benefits and its relation to total expenditure on family 
policy, (2) the level of family benefits, (3) the variation in the level of benefits according to family 
characteristics such as earnings level, family size and family type and, (4) the gender-neutrality of the tax-
benefit system. As discussed above, expenditure data is available from different sources. We suggest using 
indicators from the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX) and the European System of Integrated 
Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS). The main reason for including an additional database is that 
ESSPROS provides information on all non-OECD EU countries, for which comparable data on family 
policies are still scarce. Combined, the two databases cover the full sample of OECD and EU countries 9 However, this view ignores that the design of policy measures (e.g., means-testing) and administrative 
procedures have an influence on the process of claiming benefits and on the non-take-up rate (van 
Oorschot 1991). 10 The OECD Family Database contains an indicator on the level of child support (PF5). However, the 
indicator on the level of benefits covers only a small set of countries and is therefore not included. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 52 (see indicator PF1 in OECD FDB). 11 Since the two databases are not fully comparable, the ESSPROS data 
should be reported also for the countries covered in SOCX. There are no or tiny deviations for many 
countries, but some distinct differences for some countries, which we discuss when presenting the data. 
SOCX as well as ESSPROS provide detailed information on different types of expenditure on family 
policy; in ESSPROS, for example, expenditures are subdivided into 48 categories. In order to assess the 
basic characteristics of the general focus of a country's family policy, we first present information on total 
public expenditure on family policy. In addition, we distinguish the aggregate categories of cash benefits 
(and as a subcategory child or family allowances), in-kind benefits and tax breaks. The databases allow 
for additional comparisons of differences in targeting (means-tested vs. non-means-tested expenditure), 
periodic and lump-sum payments, and other details that we do not include in our core assessment. Box 9. Indicators for core assessment: family benefits @BULLET Total public expenditure on family policy @BULLET Public expenditure on cash benefits @BULLET Public expenditure in kind @BULLET Tax breaks @BULLET Public expenditure on child or family allowances @BULLET Size of family benefit package by level of earnings @BULLET Size of family benefit package by family size @BULLET Size of family benefit package by family type @BULLET Gender-neutrality of tax-benefit system 151. 
While many details can be omitted because the respective benefits represent just a tiny share of 
total expenditure (and therefore do not exhibit strong variation between countries), there are crucial 
distinctions in the targeting of benefit systems. However, we do not suggest addressing the targeting of 
benefits based on expenditure data (means-tested, non-means-tested spending), but based on the 
comparison of model families at different earnings levels. In our view, the evidence provided by the model 
family approach is more illustrative for assessing the crucial differences in the family benefit spending 
patterns of different countries. But how is variation by earnings level addressed in the model family 
approach in recent studies? Bradshaw and Finch (2002) and Bradshaw (2006) examine different earnings 
constellations within families, for example, couples with no earner or with one or two earners at a half or 
full average wage. If the size of the family benefit package is dependent on the earnings level, we will find 
variation by earnings constellation. If family benefits are granted independently of the level of earnings 
(such as a non-means-tested child allowance), the size will not vary. The indicators provided by the OECD 
(2007: 77) differentiate between even more earnings levels (0%, 25%, 50%, … 200% of the average 
wage). Furthermore, the OECD indicators cover a larger sample of countries than the studies by Bradshaw 
and Finch (2002) and Bradshaw (2006). Therefore, we will report the OECD indicators on the size of the 
family benefit package by level of earnings. However, it is not necessary to provide information on the 
full range of income levels as indicators in the core assessment. Instead we report the size of the family 
benefit package for a family with average earnings, which provides information about the generosity of 
family benefits for an average family. If (some) benefits are means-tested, these values are informative 
about a certain range of earnings only. Therefore the OECD computes what could be called a  " targeting 
ratio " . This compares the level of benefits for those with high earnings (200% AW) to those with no 
earnings (0% AW). In the case of targeting, this ratio is greater than one. If there is no targeting of benefits 11 In the latest update of the Family Database the OECD has also used ESSPROS data for countries that are 
not included in the SOCX database. In addition, the latest version of the FDB contains updated SOCX data 
(2005). But as some of the more detailed SOCX data used in this report are not yet publicly available (only 
data on broad categories), we use the 2003 version of the SOCX data. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 53 and no earnings-dependent tax breaks, the ratio equals one. 12 If the measures – such as tax breaks – affect 
rich families more than poor families, the ratio is below one. 152. 
In a similar manner, one can assess the variation in the level of family benefits by family size 
and family type (lone parents vs. couples). We selected as core indicators the level of family benefits of a 
family with one child (aged seven) as well as a ratio that compares the benefits for a third child who is 17 
years old ( " family size ratio " ). Unfortunately, there is no information on families of different sizes with 
children in the same age group. Therefore the ratio refers to differences in the benefits for additional 
children but also to differences by the age of the child. If this ratio is greater than one, the tax-benefit 
system in a given country favours larger families and/or older children. In addition, indicators are available 
to assess the level of benefits for lone parents and couples in order to see whether different countries' 
family policies take the situation of lone parents specifically into account. Up to now, the OECD has not 
published results based on the model family approach that allow for a differentiation of families of 
different size and type. Therefore, we use the most recent data collected by Bradshaw and colleagues (see 
Bradshaw, 2006), although the study covers only 21 countries. An advantage of this study is that the data 
are fully documented, so they can be used to calculate the size of the family benefit package as a 
percentage of an average worker's wage (i.e., producing the same measure as used by the OECD). In 
addition, the results refer to the same year (2004). Again, the data available are rich in detail, but we will 
report only selected indicators. These are, however, able to give hints about the  " preferences "  of countries' 
tax-benefits systems towards smaller or larger families and towards lone parents or couples. 13 153. 
The OECD Family Database offers an alternative approach. It provides information on the level 
of family allowances in comparison to an average worker's wage (indicator PF1). In addition, the database 
contains information on the general characteristics of the family allowance system in a given country (e.g., 
differences in the level of benefits by age of child, by size of family, by income level). However, the 
information is provided in qualitative terms only. The quantitative indicator on the level of child 
allowances refers to the maximum benefit for one child between age 3 and 12. But particularly in countries 
with means-testing or strong differences in the level of benefits by family size, the full amount will be paid 
only to a small share of families. Therefore, for the core assessment we are using the information derived 
from the family model approach, which provides quantitative information on a large variety of family 
types. 154. 
The expenditure data and the indicators based on the model family approach provide information 
on the relevance of family benefits in general and the variation in the level of benefits according to the 
structure, size and earnings of families. In a last step in the core assessment, we propose to use indicators 
on the gender-neutrality of tax-benefit systems (PF4). With regard to gender equality, the extent to 
which the tax-benefit system sets incentives for an equal division of labour is crucial. A simple indicator 
that addresses this issue is whether a couple's earnings are taxed jointly or individually. However, 
individualised tax systems also have elements that take into account an earner's family context, such as 
child or partner tax breaks, which may yield similar outcomes to joint taxation systems (see Dingeldey, 
2001). We therefore suggest assessing potential differences between countries on the basis of the tax rates 
of model families, which differ by the division of labour between partners. Using information from the 
OECD tax-benefit model, we compare the tax rates of a single-earner family (earnings at 133% of the 
average wage) with a dual-earner family, where both partners earn 67% of the average rate. 12 If no benefits at the 200%-earnings levels are paid, the ratio is not defined. 13 The full data is available at the project webpage http://php.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/summs/welempfc.php (last access on 4 December 2008). Thanks to 
Jonathan Bradshaw for some additional hints. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 54 7.3 
Assessment of Country Differences 155. 
Tables 9, 10 and 11 present an overview of the indicators for all countries (as far as information 
is available). As in previous sections of this report, we briefly discuss OECD and EU averages of the 
individual indicators. However, since the number of countries differs from indicator to indicator, the 
average values are computed on the basis of different samples. 156. 
We discuss expenditure data first. We will comment separately on ESSPROS and SOCX data only 
if there are relevant differences. OECD countries spend 2.2% of their GDP on family policy. Depending on 
our data source, average expenditure in EU countries is slightly higher or lower. The total public 
expenditure on family policy ranges from less than 1% to about 4% of GDP. Expenditure on cash benefits 
is about 1.5% in the OECD and EU countries. In-kind expenditure is significantly lower. The data on 
expenditure in the form of tax breaks is available for OECD countries only (with some countries missing). 
As tax breaks are not always used to support families, the expenditure is zero in many countries. The OECD 
and EU averages are therefore below 0.5%. The indicators discussed so far allow for a general overview of 
family policy expenditure. As the broad category of cash benefits contains expenditure on parental leave as 
well as on child or family allowances, we provide an additional, more detailed indicator. It shows that, on 
average, the OECD and EU countries spend around 1% of GDP on child or family allowances. This is about 
two thirds of the total expenditure on cash benefits. However, countries such as Denmark or Sweden put an 
emphasis on parental leave compensation and therefore exhibit only average spending on family allowances 
despite an overall high expenditure on total cash benefits. In Germany and Ireland, a larger share of cash 
benefits goes into family allowances rather than into parental leave compensation. 157. 
A detailed comparison of SOCX and ESSPROS data reveals important differences between a 
number of countries. In some countries, there are large differences in the level of in-kind expenditure (e.g., 
France). A likely explanation is that part of the expenditure in the ESSPROS data on childcare is not 
counted as in-kind expenditure on family policy but on education. Differences in the level of cash spending 
can be explained by expenditure that may be classified either as social assistance or family expenditure 
(e.g., in the UK). There also appear to be different approaches to how to classify expenditure on tax breaks. 
Expenditure on cash benefits and tax breaks for some countries in SOCX approximately add up to the 
expenditure on cash benefits in ESSPROS (e.g., Germany). However, it is unclear whether this is the only 
reason for these differences (for a brief discussion of differences between SOCX and ESSPROS data, see 
also Math and Thévenon, 2008). 158. 
The family model approach provides information on the level of benefits at the family level. At 
average earnings, the family benefit package of a family is worth on average about 10% of the average 
wage. In many countries, the size of the package depends on earnings. Therefore, the targeting ratio (ratio 
of 0% AW to 200% AW) is on average greater than one. The difference between the OECD average ratio 
(2.5) and the EU average ratio (1.6) is explained by the fact that in some non-EU OECD countries, family 
benefits are strongly targeted (e.g., Australia, Canada, Korea). In some countries the family benefit 
package differs sharply by family size. In Table 10, this is expressed in the indicator for the difference 
between the benefit for the third child and that for the first child. On average, the benefit for the third child 
is about two percentage points (percentage of an average wage) higher than for the first child. The situation 
for single parents in terms of the family benefits package is not preferable in all countries. Comparing the 
family benefit packages by family type shows that in Belgium, Sweden and the Slovak Republic, taxes 
and benefits place single parents in a worse position than couples without children. In comparison to 
couples with children, the benefits for single parents are the same or lower in a larger number of countries, 
with some notable exceptions like Austria and Norway. On average, the family benefit packages of single 
parents are about the same as those of couples with children at the same wage level in the OECD countries 
(-0.2) and are smaller on average in the EU countries. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 55 159. 
Table 11 presents indicators on the gender-neutrality of the tax-benefit system. On average, 
the tax rate for single-earner couples is 21.3% in the OECD countries and 23.3% in the EU countries. It is 
on average smaller for dual-earner couples (at the same level of family earnings – 133% of an average 
wage). Hence, most countries support an equal division of paid labour in families or tax single-earner and 
dual-earner couples in the same manner. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 56 Table 9. Public expenditure on family policy SOCX

Policies on the employer/firm level are another group of measures that allow parents – or people 
with care-giving responsibilities in general – to balance work and family life. Moreover, policies on the 
employer/firm level can promote gender equality and child wellbeing. People with care obligations need 
flexibility in organising their time during the day. Hence, for employed parents balancing work and family 
life involves not only the distribution of childcare (see Chapter 6) and parental leave (see Chapter 5), but 
also policies on the employer/firm level, such as flexible working hours and particular family-friendly 
workplace arrangements. One might argue that policies on the employer/firm level are of less importance 
for the assessment of family policy on the state level, given their narrow focus on the firm or employer. 
Nevertheless, there is a clear connection between family-friendly workplaces and outcomes for society and 
the economy as a whole (see Chapter 3). Moreover, new approaches to national family policy – such as 
those introduced in Germany – focus much more on employers than former policy approaches did. Other 
countries, like the Netherlands, have a longer tradition of employer support for families, such as the 
co-financing of childcare. 161. 
In this vein, joint efforts by the government and employers to improve workplaces are one 
potential instrument for family policy. Given the increasing importance of such approaches, countries need 
indicators to assess family policies that reflect and influence workplace practices. 162. 
In general, one can distinguish between sets of workplace practices that either are enforced by 
law on the national or sub-national level or are agreed upon between unions and employers or within the 
firms themselves. At the firm level, four types of family-friendly working arrangements can be 
distinguished: flexible working arrangements, special leave arrangements, special childcare arrangements 
and other supportive arrangements (originally developed by Den Dulk, 2001). With regard to leave and 
childcare arrangements, the measures provided at the firm level are often complementary to parental leave 
and childcare provided on the national level, as discussed in the preceding chapters. Thus, leave 
arrangements offered by employers are often provided for family reasons (e.g., sick child leave). Childcare 
arrangements at the firm level may include workplace nurseries, contractually guaranteed slots in outside 
childcare facilities, or financial assistance (for an overview, see Den Dulk, 2001). Flexible time 
arrangements are the most common approach by employers to enable employees to reconcile work and 
care responsibilities. Other supportive measures offer possibilities such as work-family management 
training or employee counselling. So far, these services are not widespread among firms, and there are 
hardly any representative internationally comparable data on this. 8.1 
General Approach 163. 
On the firm level, two ways of balancing work and family life can be distinguished (Den Dulk, 
2001): providing facilities that ease the burden of childcare, or giving employees the flexibility to adjust 
their work to their childcare responsibilities. Flexible working-time arrangements on the firm level consist 
of part-time work, flexitime, telework, and banking hours. Many analyses focus on part-time work as the 
most common work-family arrangement. For Europe, the Establishment Survey on Working Time and 
Work-Life Balance (ESWT), surveying more than 21 000 firms with 10 or more employees in 21 European 
countries, makes it possible to assess part-time work on the firm level in all its particulars (e.g., Anxo et 
al., 2007b). Apart from the proportion of employees who work part-time, another important facet of part-
time work is the notion of reversibility. Authors often estimate whether firms provide the possibility to DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 60 reverse a temporary part-time job to a full-time job. Reversibility depicts the quality of part-time work with 
respect to reconciliation of work and family life. This indicator is used by several studies analysing part-
time work in firms; see, for instance, Anxo et al. (2007b), Flüter-Hoffmann and Solbig (2003), Klammer 
and Letablier (2007) and Riedmann et al. (2006). Other forms of flexible working-time arrangements that 
should be assessed include the option to vary the start and end of daily work, to accumulate hours, to use 
accumulated hours for full days off, and to use accumulated hours for longer periods of leave. This 
selection of flexible time schemes is used in analyses of family-friendly policies at the firm level by 
authors such as Den Dulk (2001), Evans (2002), Hurley (2006) and Pärnänen et al. (2007). The use of 
flexible working arrangements to assess the level of reconciliation needs to be treated with care, as other 
studies report that companies do not necessarily provide the same type of family-friendly working 
measures, as certain arrangements depend on the structure of the firms (Chung et al., 2007). 164. 
While leave arrangements have been discussed in Chapter 5.1, in a workplace context it is 
important whether the organisational culture in the workplace encourages or discourages employees from 
taking parental leave. The different or additional leave options provided by employers reveal attitudes and 
barriers in the workplace. Fathers might face negative attitudes towards taking paternity leave. Conversely, 
employers face difficulties managing parental leave absences. Hence, in order to assess a firm's flexibility 
with regard to parental leave, fathers' take-up rates need to be considered, as does the overall prevalence of 
leave take-up. Besides Anxo et al. (2007a), Gornick and Hegewisch (2008) also refer to parental leave at 
the firm level. The take-up of leave is often used to assess parental leave systems – either at the state level 
or at the firm level. Take-up is affected by factors that influence the way parental leave operates in firms, 
including the gender division of labour, access to complementary policy measures, and opportunities for 
reduced hours. 165. 
Although childcare arrangements have been discussed in a preceding chapter (see Chapter 5.2), 
employers' provision of workplace nurseries or financial assistance indicates whether firms take an 
approach of lightening the childcare burden, or an approach enabling employees to adjust their working 
time, or both. Even today, very few firms provide employees with childcare support. In Europe, a small 
number of companies provide a variety of such services. The literature assumes that policies at the firm 
level are clustered, in that companies seem to combine childcare arrangements and leave arrangements 
(Anxo et al., 2007a). The provision of daycare by employers is also examined by Den Dulk (2001), 
Plantenga and Remery (2005) and Fagan (2003). 166. 
Other supportive arrangements have been subjected to almost no systematic cross-country 
analysis. However, a survey has been conducted of firms that provide work-family management training or 
research on employees' needs in Europe. It found that in the Netherlands, for example, only a small 
proportion of organisations have begun using an investigative method to establish employees' needs for 
certain arrangements, since work-family policies are widely covered in the media and by policy makers 
(Den Dulk, 2001). Thus, employees are already well-informed. 167. 
There are various sources available for indicators on workplace practices on the national level. 
These indicators are included in studies of the OECD countries (see, e.g., Evans, 2001) and are planned 
and to some extent already included in the OECD Family Database (e.g., indicator of employment patterns 
of couple families). For some of these indicators, see Chapter 4 on parental labour market outcomes. 
Comparative data on workplace practices on the firm level, however, are rare. They are found in sources 
such as the Establishment Survey on Working Time (ESWT), which allows for the analysis of family-
friendly arrangements in Europe. Data on OECD countries outside Europe are even more difficult to come 
by. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 61 8.2 
Selection of Indicators 168. 
For a core assessment of a country's family policy, we suggest using indicators on the firm level 
only. In the following, indicators of workplace practices are described briefly. Looking over the indicators, 
it will become obvious that they are the result of voluntary regulations or practices on the firm level (such 
as the prevalence of leave take-up). Box 10. Indicators for core assessment: policies on the employer/ firm level @BULLET Flexible working-time arrangements 
@BULLET Rationale for introducing part-time work 
@BULLET Reversibility of part-time work 
@BULLET Proportion of firms with males on parental leave 
@BULLET Prevalence of leave take-up 
@BULLET Proportion of firms providing daycare 169. 
As stated above, part-time work is, in principle, the most common flexible working-time 
arrangement. Yet part-time work is not the only form of flexible working time; hence other indicators on 
flexible working-time arrangements, such as possibilities to vary the start and end of the working day, to 
accumulate hours, to use accumulated hours for a day off, and to use accumulated hours for longer leaves, 
should be assessed as well. 14 170. 
In Europe, part-time work seems to be a good example of a practice that results from combining 
labour law and collective agreements at the firm level. The Part-Time Directive (97/81/EC) developed by 
the European Commission gives some support for a right to part-time work in its member states. At the 
firm level, employers are requested to consider (a) requests by workers to transfer from full-time to 
part-time work as the latter becomes available in the firm, and (b) requests by workers to transfer from 
part-time to full-time work or to increase their working hours should the opportunity arise (European 
Commission, 1998). Reasons for introducing part-time work may vary across firms. For many employees, 
part-time work is not regarded as a permanent status but rather as a transitory phase. The ESWT survey 
asks questions regarding the rationale for introducing part-time work in a firm, and results show that 
although companies in some countries (e.g., Germany) are obliged by law to offer their employees 
adequate part-time work upon request, the managers of many firms regard such transitions as difficult 
(Riedmann et al., 2006). About one-third of the managers questioned introduced part-time work mainly in 
response to the firm's needs rather than in response to employees' wishes (Anxo et al., 2007b). The 
indicator on the rationale for introducing part-time work in a firm approximates the right to request 
part-time work at the firm level. It shows whether part-time work is introduced in a company for economic 
or organisational reasons, or in response to employees' requests. It is particularly difficult for companies to 
provide employees the option to switch at will, as stated in the Part-Time Directive of the European Union, 
especially from full-time to part-time work. This reversibility of part-time employment is a major issue for 
the quality of part-time work. Thus we suggest adding an indicator to reflect the notion of reversibility at 
the firm level. This indicator describes the proportion of establishments offering full reversibility between 
part-time and full-time work. The majority of firms with part-timers prefer to switch employees from 
full-time to part-time work, and often do so quickly, whereas they have difficulties with the reverse process 
(Riedmann et al., 2006). 14 For an extensive assessment of family policy, the organisational methods of part-time work for country groups might 
be helpful. Nevertheless there are no country data available on this. There is only information in country groups, such 
as Scandinavia, Western Europe, the UK, the Mediterranean countries, and central Europe. Firms offer employees four 
possibilities to work part-time: they can work a set number of fixed hours every day, a set number of hours over other 
fixed periods, flexible hours on demand, or other forms (see Riedmann et al. 2006). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 62 171. 
Leave arrangements initiated at the firm level are less frequent than leave decisions mandated by 
law. Nonetheless, we consider two indicators in this context to be valuable for family policy assessment: 
first, an indicator covering the proportion of firms with male employees on parental leave and the 
respective take-up of leave for males. This indicator enables us to identify countries where fathers might 
face negative attitudes or other barriers that could prevent them from taking up parental leave. A second 
leave-related indicator is the prevalence of leave take-up among women and men. With regard to the 
gender division of parental leave, it is helpful to describe the overall acceptance of extended leave 
provision. 172. 
An indicator that clearly belongs at the firm level is the childcare arrangements of firms. The 
indicator depicting employer provision of daycare compares firms with employees on leave and firms with 
no employees on leave. It does not necessarily hold that firms with leave arrangements are more likely to 
provide daycare, as some countries differ in the state provision of childcare and leave arrangements. 8.3 
Assessment of Country Differences 173. 
As in previous sections of this report, we now briefly discuss OECD and EU averages of the 
indicators used in this chapter. Table 12 presents an overview of the indicators for all countries. Indicators 
related to policies on the employer level are scarce for the OECD countries outside Europe. In fact, all 
indicators had to be taken from European sources. This lack of non-European data is also the reason why 
the OECD and EU averages do not differ (significantly). 174. 
First, Table 12 reports indicators related to flexible working-time arrangements. Regarding 
these different possibilities, the following patterns can be noted for Europe. The possibility to vary the 
start and end of the working day is widely used among the members of the EU-21, followed by the 
possibility to use accumulated hours for longer leave periods. The former possibility is provided on 
average by 14.8% of firms in Europe, and the latter by 12.4%. The variation in the start and end of the 
working day is used mostly in Ireland (25% of firms) and Spain (23% of firms), whereas Scandinavian 
firms prefer to offer their employees the option to accumulate hours for longer leaves, i.e., Denmark (25%) 
and Sweden (27%). The possibility to use accumulated hours for full days off is provided by an average 
of 12.0% firms. The option least-used by European firms is the possibility to accumulate hours but not 
in order to take full days off; here, on average, only 7.1% of firms offer this option as a flexible working 
time arrangement. 175. 
The indicators describing the rationale for introducing part-time work in firms approximate 
the right, provided at the firm level, to request a switch from full-time to part-time work. Here, for the most 
part firms report that employees switch to part-time work mainly on employee wishes (on average 
37.9%). This is for instance the case for firms in Scandinavian countries, i.e., 50% in Denmark. The reason 
 " mainly needs of establishment "  is high in Cyprus (60%) and in Poland (65%). This rationale averages 
34.3% among the members of the EU-21. Firms that reported establishment needs and employee wishes 
being of equal importance in switches to part-time work make up 20.8% of all firms in Europe. 176. 
Countries should assess not only the possibility of part-time work at the firm level, but also the 
notion of reversibility. The indicator reporting reversibility indicates the proportion of firms per country 
where employees can switch from part-time to full-time. On average 9% of firms that allow their 
employees to switch from full-time to part-time also provide the possibility to switch back to full-time 
employment. The highest proportion of firms providing reversibility can be found in Sweden (17%), in 
Austria (16%), in France (16%) and in the UK (16%). 177. 
Leave arrangements provided at the firm level are less frequent than at state level. The indicators 
firms with males on parental leave and prevalence of leave take-up allow parental leave to be assessed DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 63 at the firm level. In Europe, 31.6% of establishments allow male employees to go on leave. The 
Scandinavian countries report the highest proportion of firms offering leave periods to male employees 
among all firms with employees on parental leave in past three years, for example, Finland (59%) and 
Sweden (69%). The prevalence of leave take-up amounts to an average of 54.7% of firms. Sweden (89%) 
and Finland (80%) again state the highest prevalence of leave. However, a preferable situation for 
employees with regard to leave take-up is not found in all countries. In Spain, for instance, only 25% of 
firms report a prevalence of leave. 178. 
Finally, we discuss the childcare arrangements of firms. The proportion of firms offering 
childcare arrangements as an additional form of support is reported separately according to the number of 
employees on leave. On average, 6.9% of firms providing childcare arrangements have no employees on 
leave, whereas 8.1% of firms offering childcare as an additional support do have employees on leave. The 
provision of such services at a company level is significantly more extensive in some countries, i.e., the 
Netherlands (41% of firms with employees on leave), Latvia (22%) and the UK (17%) than in other 
countries. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 64 Table 12. Policies on the employer/firm level P o s s ib ility to v a ry

For governments that want to assess their family policies, it is important to have some guidance 
as to which context and outcome indicators on the one hand and which indicators on policy measures on 
the other hand should be analysed. It is the purpose of this chapter to demonstrate which indicators and 
which measures should be considered when assessing the policy aims discussed here: gender equality, 
child wellbeing and balancing work and family life. 180. 
In order for countries to assess their national family policies, it is important not only for them to 
interpret policies according to relevant context and outcome criteria, but also for them to be able to assess 
their position relative to other countries. For this purpose, national scorecards have been developed. In 
principle they can be constructed for all countries. We demonstrate the use and construction of these 
scorecards for three countries: Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany. These are merely examples 
that demonstrate the principles of our scorecards. 181. 
The scorecards cover most of the core indicators discussed earlier in the report and consist of a 
selection of what are considered to be the most relevant context, outcome and policy indicators for the 
achievement of any of the three policy goals: gender equality, child wellbeing and balancing work and 
family life. 182. 
Each policy indicator in the scorecards is chosen according to its importance for achieving the 
policy goal, whereas context and outcome indicators are chosen based on how well they illustrate the 
country context and state of the policy goal. Policy measure, context and outcome indicators might be part 
of more than one policy goal; for example, the provision of early childhood education and care might serve 
all three purposes of achieving gender equality, promoting child wellbeing, and maintaining a balance 
between work and family life. In most cases, however, indicators have either a direct or an indirect 
relationship with policy goals. 183. 
In the scorecards, each state can assess the relative value of its national indicators in two graphs. 
The first graph presents the relative values of the national indicators on context and outcome dimensions; 
the second graph presents the relative values of the family policy indicators. For each indicator, its 
assumed relationship with one of our three overall policy goals has been indicated by a capital letter: G for 
gender equality, C for child wellbeing and B for balancing work and family life. 184. 
It is of great importance to keep in mind that the choice of indicators does not reflect the stance 
that there is a direct statistical causal relationship between context, policy measures and outcomes. This 
would require much more extensive statistical testing. The scorecards can only give a first indication as to 
which indicators are important to take into consideration when assessing policy settings. 185. 
Moreover, we would like to emphasise that the scorecards are merely first attempts at a family 
policy assessment. They should stimulate the discussion. Furthermore, they are open for improvement. 
Such improvements can take place in the methodology, in the data quality, in the availability of data to 
construct the indicators, and in the links between policy aims and indicators. Apart from this, more 
indicators could be added. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 66 9.1 
Potential Linkages between Policy Aims, Context and Outcome Indicators and Policy Measures 186. 
As described in Chapter 3.2, agreeing and then defining the aims of family policy is a major 
precondition for family policy assessment. These aims establish the foundation for the assessment and 
determine what direction it will take. In some cases, the results of the assessment will differ depending on 
which guiding aims are chosen; in others, they will not. However, since both the list of indicators and the 
list of policy measures are subject to change, the proposed groupings may change as well. What is 
presented here should be regarded as suggestions, open for discussion and improvement. In the end, only 
the extent to which such groupings are being used will demonstrate whether they were appropriate and 
useful for government assessment. 9.2 
Policy Aim: Child Wellbeing 187. 
If governments want to assess whether the aim of ensuring child wellbeing has been achieved in 
their countries, a first set of context indicators in the short run and outcome measures in the long run could 
be considered. The following box summarises indicators that refer clearly and directly to the wellbeing of 
the child. Some indicators refer to child wellbeing in a more indirect manner, via the time parents spend 
with their children and via the financial resources available to the family if one or both parents are 
employed. While the use of the first set of indicators is relatively straightforward, the use of the latter more 
indirect set provides an example of the difficulties associated with attempting to link particular indicators 
with even one particular policy aim. On the one hand, parental employment clearly increases the material 
wellbeing of families, leading to a potential increase in the material wellbeing of the children. But on the 
other hand, there is no clear correlation between parental employment and child development or child 
wellbeing. This correlation depends on a set of various factors related to employment, or even other factors 
relating to parents, children and the care situation. The average number of actual working hours, preferred 
hours versus current hours, and the time spent on childcare and daily household chores are important as 
well. But even these objective indicators show no clear picture. Some child development advocates argue 
that what matters is not simply the time parents spend with their children but the quality of that time. 
Others may argue that it is the parents' satisfaction with their work-life balance that matters, and not so 
much the question of employment. Thus, the life satisfaction of parents could be another important 
indicator for child wellbeing. Box 11. Context and outcome indicators relevant to child wellbeing Directly related to child wellbeing

The linkage between policy measures and the policy aim of child wellbeing is affected by a 
number of direct and more indirect measures. Again, we try to summarise some of the measures relevant to 
child wellbeing that were discussed in Chapter 5. Leave and ECEC measures in particular are directly 
linked to child wellbeing. It is assumed that longer paid leave periods promote child development, because 
they allow parents (in particular mothers) to spend time with their very young children in what is 
considered an important phase for child development. However, from a long-term perspective, a longer 
leave period affects the labour market performance of mothers, and thus might reduce family income, 
which in turn affects the material wellbeing of the child. The linkage with ECEC measures is clearer. In 
particular, measures to increase the quality of ECEC services are of great importance for the wellbeing of 
children. With respect to more indirect measures, it is important that leave periods be paid, and that enough 
(public) funds be allocated to ECEC. These factors may affect the quantity and quality of ECEC services. 
An increase in quantity increases the employment opportunities for both parents, and thus might lead to an 
increase in the material wellbeing of children. Various family benefit measures help to increase the 
financial resources of families, and thus promote the material wellbeing of children. Moreover, special 
benefits for lone parents or families with many children might provide focussed support to groups that are 
known to be at a higher risk of poverty. Finally, policies on the employer/firm level should be considered, 
as they can help to improve the wellbeing of children as well. Flexible working-time arrangements enable 
parents to react in a more flexible way to the needs of their children. Box 12. Policy measures relevant to child wellbeing More directly related to child wellbeing

Policy Aim: Gender Equality 189. 
A large number of indicators make it possible to assess the extent to which the aim of gender 
equality has been achieved. These could include aspects of labour market equality and income inequality, 
but also issues of political participation and representation. From a family policy perspective, equal 
representation in the labour market, equal pay and equal sharing of time appear most pertinent. The 
respective indicators can thus be used for an assessment of the aim of gender equality. Differences in 
labour earnings between men and women are reflected in the gender pay gap. There are various indicators 
that measure the gendered structure of the labour market. The gender employment gap captures the overall 
differences between men and women in labour-market participation. Maternal employment rates are more 
directly focussed on the relationship between gender, family and employment. Part-time employment is, in 
many countries, an important means of gaining flexibility to combine work and family. However, a part-
time working status often entails lower earnings and more limited career opportunities. As part-timers are 
predominantly women, a high share of part-time work not only means higher flexibility but also 
restrictions for women in the labour market. Furthermore, the equal sharing of paid work, as captured by 
labour-market participation rates, does not necessarily mean the equal sharing of unpaid work. Therefore 
gendered information on the time spent on paid work care and household chores is an important indicator 
to assess gender equality. Box 13. Context and outcome indicators relevant to gender equality Earnings

As with the policy aim of child wellbeing, there are a large number of policy measures that affect 
the aim of gender equality. There is also substantial overlap among policies – that is, policies that affect 
both aims. For instance, policies directed at the maternal labour market position and the sharing of unpaid 
work also have an impact on child wellbeing (higher resources, less time for childcare). It is also true that 
most family policies will have some impact on gender equality – some more directly, others less directly. 
Thus, measures from all four policy areas (leave schemes, family benefits, early childhood education and 
care, policies on the employer/firm level) are regarded as important for achieving the aim of gender 
equality. A direct link can be assumed between policies such as leave schemes that affect maternal and 
paternal labour market positions (in particular the relationship of maternal to paternal leave) and the 
reversibility of part-time work to full-time work. Furthermore, a gender-neutral tax-benefit system is 
expected to positively influence the equal division of labour within households. Indirectly, not only will the 
relation of maternal to paternal leave affect gender equality, but also the design of leave policies in broader 
terms. The availability of formal childcare increases opportunities for the labour-market participation of 
care providers. Therefore, policies such as formal entitlement to daycare, take-up rates of daycare and 
educational services, the share of children in full-time provision, opening hours, and ECEC expenditure are 
included. It should be kept in mind that equal labour-market participation rates do not necessarily imply an 
equal position on the labour market (e.g., due to the gender pay gap). The same constraint may apply to 
policies at the employer/firm level that increase flexibility in the workplace. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 69 Box 14. Policy measures relevant to gender equality More directly related to gender equality

Policy Aim: Balancing Work and Family Life 191. 
When assessing whether parents can balance work and family life, relevant direct context and 
outcome indicators should outline the demographic structure as well as the employment situation. These 
are set out in Box 15. It is not always easy to establish whether these are outcome or context indicators; for 
example, high female employment rates may be the result of a preference for having fewer children or, 
conversely, high labour force participation may cause women to prefer having fewer children. 
Nevertheless, the indicators can be used for a better understanding of which factors are relevant in a 
national assessment. Among the demographic indicators proposed to have direct relevance for the 
understanding of the balance between work and family life, fertility rates and women's average age at first 
birth should be considered, as they are likely to be influenced by problems combining work and family life. 
The average household size, the proportion of households without children, as well as the difference 
between the actual and ideal number of children may also be indicative of whether families succeed in 
balancing work and family life. The reasons why women have not fulfilled their childbearing desires can 
explain the extent to which these reasons are work-related. 192. 
Among the employment indicators, one of the most important context and outcome indicators is 
how many mothers are in employment, as this indicates whether it is possible to combine motherhood and 
paid labour. Average working hours may also be indicative of how pressured men and women feel. We 
assume that part-time employment rates for men and women indicate how much difficulty parents face 
combining work and family life, but this may also represent a strategy for participating in the labour 
market while children are small or it may be an (undesired) solution to problems balancing work and 
family life. How men and women distribute the household chores between them may also indicate the 
extent to which women are more burdened with these tasks and therefore find it difficult to participate in 
paid labour. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 70 193. 
Of the more indirect indicators, life satisfaction may reveal the difficulties men and women have 
combining work and family life – if we accept this as part of general life satisfaction. The indicator of lone 
parent households is relevant, albeit indirectly, for understanding in how many households the sole 
breadwinner also bears sole responsibility for the family and household chores. Box 15. Context and outcome indicators relevant to balancing work and family life Directly related to balancing work and family life

Policy measures of direct relevance that should be included in an assessment of the policy goal of 
balancing work and family life include measures on leave, ECEC, taxes and employment. These are 
outlined in Box 16. 195. 
We assume that the public investment in leave and ECEC services, represented by the social 
expenditure levels in these two policy fields, will reflect the possibility for parents to choose between 
looking after the child at home or having the child looked after in formal daycare. A combination of high 
expenditure in both policy fields would very crudely indicate better possibilities to combine work and 
family life (not taking into account institutional variation in leave and ECEC arrangements across 
countries). Likewise, the length of leave may indicate whether it is possible to take time off work to look 
after the child, but this would preferably exist in combination with high enrolment rates and formal 
entitlement to ECEC in order to provide a choice between work and childcare. The compensation rates 
provided by leave schemes as well as the effective amount of leave provided indicate how realistic it is for 
men and women to actually take the leave, and in cases where the compensation rate is low, the rates also 
indirectly indicate the pressure on the woman to take the majority of the leave, since she is normally the 
one who earns lower wages. Finally, the gender equality index also portrays the possible gender imbalance 
in the design of the leave schemes and how this may affect women's opportunities for balancing work and 
family life. 196. 
Payments for ECEC, opening hours, and the possibility to use full-time services may also 
influence parents' decisions to make use of these services and thus whether it is feasible to combine work 
and family life. 197. 
In regard to indicators on employment, the statutory regulation of the maximum number of 
working hours as well as the average number of actual working hours are important for understanding how 
much time work takes up and whether this leaves time for tending to a family, whereas existing problems DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 71 balancing work and family life may be captured in the indicator current vs. preferred working hours of 
parents. 198. 
Parents may also consider the quality of the services, reported as child:staff ratios and staff 
training levels, when deciding whether and how much they want to use services. 199. 
Parents may also consider the quality of services, reported as child:staff ratios and staff training 
levels, when deciding whether and how much they want to use services, but since these indicators relate to 
the child's outcome from participating in ECEC services, they are treated as indirect indicators under this 
policy aim. 200. 
Finally, various family benefit indicators may be included as indirect indicators of whether men 
and women can balance work and family life, insofar as they indicate the general support available to 
families and the degree to which parents need to supplement their income from paid labour. Box 16. Policy measure indicators relevant to balancing work and family life Directly relevant to balancing work and family life

Description of Scorecards 201. 
Scorecards have been constructed for three countries – Denmark, Germany, and the UK – in 
order to illustrate how a comparable synthesis of country context, policy measures and outcome indicators 
can be presented. In principle, scorecards for all countries could be made in the same manner. 202. 
For each country we present two figures. The first provides an overview of outcome and context 
indicators (see Chapter 4) that are directly related to the policy aims of child wellbeing, gender equality 
and balancing work and family life. The second contains information on indicators that describe the design 
of family policy measures (see Chapter 5). Both figures follow the same style in organising the data. The 
basic idea is to present a country's value for a given indicator in relation to the indicator's distribution 
across all countries. Therefore, for each indicator the figures contain the mean, minimum and maximum 
values. This allows for a quick and transparent assessment of a country's position in comparison to other 
countries. 203. 
All indicators have been transformed into z-scores (i.e., the deviation of a value from the mean 
divided by the standard deviation). The mean of a z-standardised variable is zero; one unit equals the 
standard variation of this variable. Hence, the scale is the same for all indicators and they can be compared 
directly. To provide a better orientation, all figures include separating lines at +1/2 and -1/2 standard 
deviations. Values falling between these two lines can be regarded as close to the mean of the variable. The 
same logic has already been used in earlier chapters to differentiate between three levels for each indicator 
(>, O, <). It is relatively unproblematic to update the z-scores, as they are simple calculations of raw 
indicators based on the data available from the OECD database. 204. 
The labels in the figures on family policy indicators contain the additional letters C, B and G. 
These letters pick up the discussion in Section 6.1 of the link between family policy measures and policy 
aims. For instance, C signifies that the respective indicator is directly or indirectly related to the aim of 
child wellbeing (B=balancing work and family life, G=gender equality). However, many indicators are 
directly related to all three policy aims or might be related to an additional policy aim at least indirectly. 
Therefore, the letters are meant as a tool to read the figure, but they do not suggest that a proper evaluation 
has established a causal relationship between a policy measure and an outcome. 205. 
Two additional caveats should be added. First, the country sample differs from indicator to 
indicator (see the respective tables in Chapters 4 and 5). Therefore, the calculation of the mean, the 
standard deviation, and the minimum and maximum often does not take into account the full sample of 38 
countries examined in this report. Second, the direction of the indicators differs. A high value does not 
always have to be read as a positive outcome, and a low value can be positive (e.g., a low proportion of 
children in poverty). As the interpretation of a given value sometimes depends on the policy aim or is 
simply a normative question, we have not attempted to produce unidirectional indicators. Hence, if a 
country exhibits the maximum, it just means  " highest value "  and not necessarily  " best performer " . 206. 
We briefly discuss the example of Denmark to illustrate the contents of the scorecards. The first 
graph is divided into three subsections that contain context and outcome indicators for the three policy 
aims: child wellbeing, balancing work and family life and gender equality. Denmark scores low in most 
indicators of child wellbeing (values below the average over all countries for which an indicator is 
available). However, with the exception of the PISA scores, which are almost average, a low share can be 
interpreted in a positive way. The share of young men and women not in education and the child poverty 
rate there are the lowest among all countries. The share of children with low birth weight is also well 
below the average. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 73 207. 
Regarding the indicators that describe the context and outcomes in the field of balancing work 
and family life, we also have to take into account the direction of the indicators. Denmark scores above-
average with regard to maternal employment rates, the part-time employment rate of men, the fertility rate, 
and the share of households with no children, and the difference between the actual and ideal number of 
children also tends to be high. The average household size is below average. However, the share of people 
who state that they do not have children because of difficulties combining work and family life or due to 
financial problems is low. The share of childless women who do not desire to have children (childbearing 
preferences), the mean age of women at first birth, and the part-time employment rate of women are at a 
level at or near the average. It is not easy to summarise the results for Denmark under a common heading 
that reflects the complexity involved in assessing the outcomes and the contexts for the aim of balancing 
work and family life. 208. 
Looking at the aim of gender equality, we find three indicators that have already been used since 
they are also related to the aim of balancing work and family life (part-time employment rates of men and 
women, maternal employment rates). The other two indicators show that the gender wage gap as well as 
the gender employment gap is comparatively low in Denmark. 209. 
The second graph, which shows the family policy indicators, is divided into six subsections 
(benefits and taxes, expenditure, firm-level policies, working time, child care, parental leave). Denmark 
scores rather high (or at the top) with respect to compensation for parental leave, but lower with respect to 
the length of parental leave. Denmark also scores high in almost all indicators that describe the child-care 
system. In many areas – such as childcare – it is easy to assume that policy measures are related to all three 
policy aims. The enrolment rates in childcare are high. For zero to two-year-olds, they are the highest of all 
countries in our comparison. The share of children in full-time care (as a percentage of all children in care) 
is high. Childcare facilities in Denmark have, on average, long opening hours. On some of the indicators, 
Denmark scores low. First, the child:staff ratio in preschool programmes is low, which can be taken as an 
indicator of the quality of the programmes. The share of public funding is also low (while the overall 
public expenditure on ECEC is high). This example shows clearly that it takes a normative view to 
evaluate whether high or low indicators should be interpreted in a positive or negative manner. 210. 
Looking at working-time regulations, the scorecard shows a mixed picture for Denmark. The 
statutory maximum is the highest of all OECD and EU countries. However, the collectively agreed average 
working time is well below the average. There are, to varying degrees, possibilities to accumulate hours. A 
comparatively high share of firms offer the option to reverse part-time work. With respect to firm-level 
policies, the share of firms providing daycare is below average; the share of firms with males on parental 
leave is above average. 211. 
Overall, public expenditure indicators show that Denmark spends a high share of its GDP on 
family policies, in particular on in-kind measures. But expenditure on cash benefits is also above average 
(which includes expenditure on parental leave). Family support via tax breaks seems to play a minor role 
compared to other countries. The family benefit package for a family at the average wage level is slightly 
above average. Benefits for larger families or single parents are not particularly high compared to other 
families. Average tax rates are high, as are the differences between the tax rates for single and dual earners 
(i.e., the rate for dual earners is lower). 212. 
Although the scorecards are meant as a tool to summarise the detailed information collected in 
earlier chapters, they still provide information on the value of a given indicator, but in a more standardised 
manner, with direct reference to the overall distribution of an indicator (minimum, maximum, average). In 
our view, this allows for a quicker assessment of an overall country profile without assigning an overall 
grade to that country's family policy, since many of the indicators can be read in different ways (positive 
for one aim, negative for another). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 74 CHAPTER 10. CONCLUSION 213. 
This report provides a first attempt at identifying and operationalising relevant indicators for a 
national assessment of family policy. Indicators on contexts, outcomes and policy measures have been 
selected according to a definition of family policy that focuses on families with younger children. The 
indicators have been selected according to their importance and relevance for three overall policy aims: 
child wellbeing, gender equality and balancing work and family life. Based on the indicators selected, 
country-specific scorecards for the assessment of family policy were drawn up. Three national scorecards 
have been presented as examples to illustrate how countries can assess their family policy relative to other 
comparable countries. 214. 
The indicators chosen for use in this report by no means represent an exhaustive list. They are 
part of an pragmatic approach based on the data presently available. Throughout the report, we have 
commented on the limitations of the available data and which additional data we would like to see 
provided. Much of the data originates from the OECD Family Database, which represents a genuine 
advance in making data comparable and accessible, and in providing an understanding of the cross-country 
differences in family policy design. Still, more accuracy is needed in the overview of expenditure of family 
services and early childhood services. 215. 
We would also like to see more child-centred indicators oriented where the child is the primary 
unit of observation and analysis. Child-centred data can give a more holistic picture of children's rights and 
the realities that shape children's lives. For example, the number of hours worked and time devoted to 
caring by both parents per child, which would suggest how the child might be affected by the amount of 
time that both the mother and father work. Child-centred data would also further understanding of national 
and international differences in combinations of leave and early years daycare. 216. 
National governments should also consider investing more resources in developing panel data 
sets which allow for the monitoring of child development over time. Examples of such an approach are the 
British 'National Child Development Study', 'The British Cohort Study', and 'The Millennium Study', the 
'German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP)', from the US 'The NICD study', The Danish Longitudinal 
Survey of Children, and the recently started French  " Etude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance " . 217. 
Overall, the available data on the various leave schemes is not sufficient for a full understanding 
of the national differences, for example, for comprehending how parents combine various forms of 
parental leave and what compensation is available for them across different income groupings and 
employment sectors. Moreover, existing indicators mainly focus on the state agencies responsible for 
family policies, while those for policies on the employer/firm level are sparse. Yet the firm level is 
important, in particular to balancing work and family life. More and better data on the firm level are 
needed for a cross-country evaluation on this level. This study has been based on comparable national data, 
but regional data would be useful to understand the national variation, which can be substantial in some 
countries. Apart from this, the indicators we selected are mainly objective measures; nevertheless, 
subjective indicators are important as well. Further work in the creation of new comparable indicators 
should take this into account. 218. 
The choice of indicators has, as mentioned, been pragmatic and policy-driven. We have not 
attempted to investigate whether indicators are directly related to policy aims. Since the policy aims are DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 75 rather broad, most indicators can be used to explain more than one policy aim. It has not been the purpose 
of this report to establish whether there is a linear or other relationship between indicators and policy aims, 
or to test the level at which an indicator has a negative vs. positive relationship to a policy goal. It is left to 
future investigation to establish such relationships. However, we hope that this report will contribute to 
more depth in the discussion about how to best assess family policy. It is an assessment tool makes use of 
the OECD Family Database which reflects the value of this unique data source for cross-country 
comparisons in the field of family policy.

establishments (management interviews), Data 2004-2005 Table Notes and Definitions (sorted by tables and indicators) Table 1 @BULLET Life expectancy at birth Definition: Life expectancy at birth is the average number of years that a person can be expected 
to live, assuming that age-specific mortality levels remain constant. Note: Life expectancy at birth for the total population is estimated by the OECD Secretariat for 
all countries, using the unweighted average of life expectancy of men and women. @BULLET Teenage birth rate Definition: Births per 1 000 women aged 15-19. @BULLET Births out-of-wedlock Definition: Births, where the mother's marital status at the time of birth is other than married. @BULLET Average household size Definition: The size of households is determined by members who live in the same dwelling and 
includes dependent children of all ages. Footnote to Turkey: The information in this document with reference to  " Cyprus "  relates to the 
southern part of the Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek 
Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
(TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of the United Nations, 
Turkey will maintain its position concerning the  " Cyprus issue " . Footnote by all the European 
Union member states of the OECD and the European Commission: The Republic of Cyprus is 
recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information 
in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic 
of Cyprus. @BULLET Households with no children Definition: Households with no children, as a proportion of all households. Table 2 @BULLET Statutory maximum: Definition: Some European countries set their maximum weekly hours at the 48 hours specified 
in the EU working-time directive. Yet, some European countries also set a limit of about 40 
hours, and working-time flexibility schemes allow weekly hours to vary around an average over a 
reference period. For example, in Austria, weekly hours may be varied up to a maximum of 50 
over a reference period, if an average 40-hour week is maintained (see OECD, 2007). Table 5 @BULLET Childbearing preferences Definition: Childless women aged 15-39 with no preferences for children DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2009)16 80 @BULLET Difference between actual and ideal number of children Definition: The difference between the mean actual number of children and the mean general 
ideal number of children. Note: Females @BULLET Reasons for not fulfilling childbearing desires Definition: Distribution of people not fulfilling childbearing desires formulated at age 20 by 
reason of not having had all the children desired. Table 6 @BULLET Length of leave Note: Paternity leave includes periods set for fathers' quotas; payment may vary between the two 
schemes. @BULLET Effective leave Note: Based on 2FTE/SR meaning full-time equivalent salary replacement. Thus, 40 weeks 
replaced by 100% of earnings has a coefficient of 40; at 50% of earnings, a coefficient of 20. 
Please note that the calculations are approximate, as some countries offer a percentage of salary 
while others offer only a percentage of a minimum wage or unemployment benefit. Although a 
percentage of salary will in most cases be superior to a percentage of the minimum wage (or in 
the Nordic countries, to the wage of an unskilled worker), the calculation of the replacement 
wage in this table treats both sources in the same way, that is, 50% of the minimum wage and 
50% of salary receive an equal weighting. @BULLET Gender equality index Definition: Measure of countries' policies on a fifteen-point scale, with nine possible points for 
the distribution of leave, five possible points for the level of wage replacement during leave, and 
one possible point (positive or negative) for policy incentives that encourage men to take or not 
take the leave available. Table 7 @BULLET Public expenditure ECEC Definition: Public expenditure on childcare and pre-primary education services, percentage of 
GDP. Table 8 @BULLET Average opening hours Definition: Average opening hours of ECEC @BULLET Training of staff Definition: 50% of staff in accredited early education services tertiary educated with relevant 
qualifications. Note: Data for UK refers to England only.
