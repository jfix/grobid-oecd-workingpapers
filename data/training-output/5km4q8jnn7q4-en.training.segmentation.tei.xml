			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Transport is closely linked with economic activity. Some types of transport provide inputs to <lb/>production in the form of commuting and business trips and by moving goods between producers and <lb/>consumers. The decrease in the cost of freight transport by a factor 10 over the last 100 years <lb/>(Glaeser &amp; Kohlhase, 2004) has facilitated a freight-intensive organization of production. Other forms <lb/>of transport help households carry out the activities they are interested in. Income growth stimulates <lb/>the demand for such transport and, together with the decrease in prices of car and air transport, has <lb/>generated a strong increase in individual mobility in rich countries for all kinds of activities, including <lb/>commuting, education, recreation, use of services, shopping, and tourism. Public policy has largely <lb/>accommodated – and sometimes inadvertently stimulated – these developments via its spatial <lb/>planning and infrastructure capacity decisions, so that economic development in advanced economies <lb/>has gone hand in hand with strongly growing transport volumes. <lb/>Despite its obvious success, this model meets with criticism. Current transport patterns are <lb/>widely seen as &quot; unsustainable &quot; , especially with emerging economies evolving towards current <lb/>advanced economies&apos; levels of economic welfare and transport activity. In economics, sustainability is <lb/>mostly defined in a narrow way (Arrow et al., 2004) focusing on guaranteeing the consumption <lb/>possibilities of the future generations. It is clear that transport activities contribute to long-term <lb/>problems concerning climate change, jeopardize the long-term availability of oil resources, so <lb/>transport is relevant to the narrow sustainability problem. However, in the transport sector other, flow-<lb/>type, externalities threaten our current way of life. With continued urbanization and concentration of <lb/>economic activity in ever larger metropolitan areas, congestion levels could become intolerable. Levels <lb/>of noise and pollution remain problematic despite advanced emission control technology. Evidence <lb/></body>

			<body>suggests that these flow externalities are quantitatively at least as important as the climate and energy <lb/>resource problem (cf. e.g. Small and Van Dender, 2007 or Proost et al., 2009, for the EU). <lb/>Given these problems, it is widely felt that something must be done. Addressing the different <lb/>external costs of transport requires well-targeted policies, including congestion pricing, fuel taxes, and <lb/>fuel economy regulations. These are discussed in for example, Anas and Lindsey, 2010, and <lb/>Anderson et al., 2010. Here we focus on the role of modal choice, technologies and spatial structure <lb/>as framework factors that determine transport demand and its energy and environmental impact, and <lb/>that may be amenable to modification through policy. Taking such a broad view helps establish policy <lb/>priorities. <lb/>A word of caution is in order. What makes transport activities different from say house or <lb/>factory heating, two activities that also emit greenhouse gasses? There are two differences. First in <lb/>most transport activities users compete for the use of common transport infrastructure, causing <lb/>congestion. This level of congestion has a negative feedback on the volume of demand. The effect of <lb/>congestion on the volume of transport demand and the policies to address the problem are relatively <lb/>well understood in economics (see e.g. Small &amp; Verhoef, 2007). There is a second difference: <lb/>transport is ultimately the movement of persons or goods over space between houses, shops, <lb/>factories etc. Put naively, we can minimize transport activities by having a very large number of small <lb/>towns that are self sufficient. This comes at an economic cost in terms of productivity (scale, diversity, <lb/>specialization etc.) and in terms of other externalities (noise, neighbour interferences etc.). Our <lb/>knowledge of the long term interplay between economic development, spatial distribution of economic <lb/>activities and transport costs is at best still very partial (see Fujita &amp; Thisse, 2002, for regional location <lb/>and Glaeser, 2008, for urban location). Often the causality runs both ways and multiple equilibriums <lb/>can exist. Poor knowledge by economists leaves a lot of room for interpretation by policy makers so <lb/>we should not be surprised to encounter very different policies. <lb/>Section 2 briefly reviews some scenarios on long-term developments of the demand for <lb/>transport, emphasizing that there is little hope for controlling transport externalities through reductions <lb/>in global transport volumes. Sections 3, 4 and 5 examine three policy levers: modal choice, technology <lb/></body>

			<body>and spatial structure. In a nutshell, we find that policies that affect modal choice can in some cases <lb/>reduce environmental impacts, but whether they are attractive from a broader economic point of view <lb/>is far from obvious. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through improved technology is possible, at <lb/>relatively low cost and at first through the improvement of conventional drive-train technology. Spatial <lb/>structure affects transport demand, but using it as a policy lever is difficult and less effective than often <lb/>thought. In addition, limited understanding of the interactions heightens the risk of triggering <lb/>unintended – and undesirable – consequences. Section 6 concludes. <lb/>2. LONG TERM VIEWS AND DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL COSTS <lb/>Taking a long-term view, this section explores how transport volumes (measured in passenger <lb/>kilometres and ton kilometres for freight) and the associated greenhouse gas emissions and levels of <lb/>congestion might evolve under a business-as-usual scenario. <lb/>2.1 <lb/>Long-term trends in transport volumes <lb/>Transport was responsible for about 13% of world greenhouse gas emissions in 2004, and it <lb/>represented 23% of greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion in 2005 (30% in the OECD; ITF, <lb/>2009). Greenhouse gas emissions from transport depend on transport volumes and on the <lb/>carbon-intensity of the various technologies used. Section 3 discusses how technologies in a number <lb/>of key market segments could evolve. Here, we ask how demand for transport might develop. Various <lb/>institutions publish global projections for transport demand with a 2030 or 2050 horizon, see e.g. IEA <lb/>(2009), ITF (2009), Exxon (2009). These projections are based on partial models of the transport <lb/>sector, focusing on the likely development of demand more than on supply and price formation. Oil <lb/>and fuel price developments, for example, are usually exogenous to the model, so independent of how <lb/>demand changes. The demand for private transport is driven mainly by income growth, according to <lb/>estimated S-shaped ownership dispersion patterns and assumptions on the evolution of usage. Given <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/></note>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>that supply is often implicitly supposed to be perfectly or at least highly elastic, the projections can be <lb/>seen as sketching &quot; where demand would like to go &quot; . <lb/>While there are differences among them, the projections agree on the key expectations: <lb/>overall transport volumes will grow very rapidly in emerging economies, while growth will be much <lb/>slower in OECD countries and may even come to a halt in some segments of the transport market. <lb/>With respect to private car travel, fast income growth in emerging economies translates into very fast <lb/>growth of car ownership levels, given the low initial levels of ownership and given population growth. In <lb/>the OECD, incomes grow at a more moderate pace and this means tepid growth of car stocks, <lb/>especially given already high ownership levels and often limited population growth. <lb/>Puentes and Tomer (2009) note that car travel in the US stopped growing in recent years, and <lb/>argue that this is not just the consequence of higher prices but also of saturation of demand, i.e. even <lb/>with higher incomes or lower prices the demand for transport would no longer increase. Crozet (2009) <lb/>makes a similar analysis for France, but notes that slower or zero growth of car transportation does <lb/>not mean that overall transportation demand stops increasing. Faster modes, such as high speed rail <lb/>and air transport, keep growing as incomes rise, as they allow consumers to squeeze more, and more <lb/>spatially dispersed, activities into the time budget. Although the jury is still out on whether car travel <lb/>has stopped growing in advanced economies, and if it did whether this is because of saturation with <lb/>travel, a zero income effect, higher fuel prices, or a combination of these factors, it is plausible that car <lb/>travel volumes will grow slowly or not at all in advanced economies and grow rapidly in emerging <lb/>economies. The overall result is considerable growth of world car transport volumes as well as in <lb/>faster travel modes (air, high speed rail) and freight transport. <lb/>2.2 <lb/>Expected GHG emissions <lb/>Policies that aim to control traffic growth in advanced economies or reduce the carbon <lb/>intensity of travel in those countries may or may not be justifiable, but they will in all likelihood not be <lb/>sufficient to reduce global emissions if expectations on how emerging economies will evolve hold true. <lb/>Although better fuel economy offsets part of the demand growth, the result is that, in a business as <lb/>usual scenario, world transport emissions of CO2 are expected to more than double by 2050 (ITF, <lb/></body>

			<body>2008). According to the same exercise, the share of OECD countries in total transport emissions is <lb/>about 60% in 2010, declining to 45% in 2030 and 35% in 2050. The share of light-duty vehicle <lb/>emissions in the total is expected to decline from 42% in 2010 to 36% in 2030 and in 2050. The share <lb/>of aviation is set to grow, from 15% in 2010 to 22% in 2030 and in 2050. <lb/>These expectations are clearly not compatible with ambitious climate change mitigation <lb/>objectives, and the underlying transport volume growth also raises challenges in terms of other <lb/>transport related externalities, including noise, traffic safety, conventional air pollution and congestion. <lb/>The continuing trend towards urbanization and the particularly fast growth of the number of <lb/>megacities 2 further stresses the need to address local pollution and congestion problems. <lb/>Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the availability and the security of resources to fuel all this <lb/>transport activity. Even taking into account that growth may be slowed down by higher energy prices, it <lb/>is still widely accepted that policy interventions are needed to control the main transport externalities. <lb/>2.3 <lb/>Main types of externalities <lb/>Transport activities cause a range of external costs, i.e. costs that are ignored by users when <lb/>they decide if, where, how, and when to travel. The level of these externalities depends on many <lb/>factors. For surface transport, key determinants include traffic volumes, mode choice, fuel type, fuel <lb/>efficiency, driver behaviour, and the location and time of day of travel. <lb/>Table 1 summarizes the main externalities and their drivers. Of the five externalities <lb/>mentioned, we will not discuss in this paper conventional air pollution, noise and traffic accidents. <lb/>Conventional air pollution and noise occur at the local level and can be contained to a substantial <lb/>degree by fairly inexpensive technical solutions. Over the period 2000-2020, the use of catalytic <lb/>converters, particulate traps and cleaner fuels is expected to reduce conventional air pollution of road <lb/>transport by 70 to 95% in the EU (TREMOVE, 2007). 3 Noise problems also can be handled to a large <lb/>2 In 2008 about half of the global population lived in cities; in 2050 city dwellers are expected to make up about <lb/>70% of the (bigger) total (UN, 2008), <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 This is not to say all problems are resolved. For example, particulate emissions are very costly in terms of <lb/>human health and control technologies remain expensive. Dieselisation strategies, favoured in some countries for <lb/>reasons of fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions, carry a cost in terms of particulate emissions or the <lb/>control thereof. Furthermore, as cheap technological fixes are gradually exhausted, policies that target a smaller <lb/>numbers of gross polluters may become preferable. <lb/></note>

			<body>extent using better vehicles, public abatement (noise screens) and protective measures (noise <lb/>insulation). Accident externalities are complex and heavily dependent on coordination of human <lb/>behaviour. Well-enforced traffic regulations and car and road technology have greatly reduced the <lb/>average accident rate in most rich countries. The rationale for ignoring these externalities here is not <lb/>that the remaining problems are unimportant, but that addressing them will require customized policy <lb/>innovations that are unlikely to have major impacts on the fundamental features of our transport <lb/>systems. In debates about congestion and climate change, more incisive changes are sometimes <lb/>envisaged. <lb/>Congestion and climate change externalities are both strongly dependent on the volume of <lb/>transport, but apart from that they are very different. With congestion there is a negative feedback loop <lb/>(more congestion leads to higher time costs of travel, and higher costs discourage demand). <lb/>Congestion derives from the concentration of volumes in time and space. If spreading demand over <lb/>time and space were easy, there would be no congestion problem as there would be ample capacity to <lb/>handle volumes. This basic observation suggests that policies to spread demand may be as effective <lb/>as attempts to reduce overall demand. For climate change, transport volumes matter as well as the <lb/>carbon intensity of travel. The distribution of demand over time and space has no impact on <lb/>greenhouse gas emissions, except to the extent that congestion levels affect fuel consumption. It <lb/>follows that policies to address congestion and climate change costs concur to the extent that volume <lb/>reductions are concerned. Anas and Lindsey (this symposium) find that in the few cities where <lb/>congestion pricing has been implemented, transport volumes within charging zones decreased by <lb/>some 10-20% and so did the CO2 emissions. However if congestion pricing mainly redistributes <lb/>demand over time and over space, the best feasible policy to address congestion may have little <lb/>impact on greenhouse gas emissions and vice versa, so that confounding both issues in policy <lb/>debates may be unproductive. <lb/></body>

MODAL CHOICE <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Modal choice for passenger transportation <lb/>In this section we consecutively discuss modal choice policies for passenger and for freight <lb/>transport. Passengers&apos; modal choices matter for many externalities. A car with 1 passenger has an <lb/>external congestion cost per passenger about 10 times as large as a bus with 25 passengers. Still <lb/>assuming sufficiently high occupancy rates, a bus uses also less fuel and causes less accident costs per <lb/>passenger. Rail uses separate track and its air pollution cost per passenger depends on the occupancy <lb/>rate and on the type of fuel used to generate the electricity needed. With a high occupancy rate, rail has <lb/>almost no external costs except for the congestion costs among the rail passengers and rail freight, and <lb/>the external noise costs. These comparisons suggest that external costs of transport can be mitigated by <lb/>favouring bus and especially rail transport, an idea that has gained currency widely in policy circles. <lb/>The present market shares of different modes differ strongly across countries. In 2005, private <lb/>passenger cars had a market share, in terms of passenger kilometre, of less than 20% in China and India <lb/>(IEA, 2009, p. 50). The other passenger kilometres were taken care of by minibuses, busses, rail and air. <lb/>In OECD Europe, cars account for 65% of total volume, bus and rail 15% and air about 15% as well. In <lb/>North America, cars take account of approximately 80%, bus and rail 5% and 15% is air transport (IEA <lb/>2009). Congestion and air pollution problems are more acute in urban areas. Urban transport is a small <lb/>share of overall passenger transport (about 20 %) and also for urban transport modal shares are very <lb/>different across countries. One of the striking differences is the much higher share of busses and rail in <lb/>OECD Europe, China and India compared to many North-American cities. <lb/>14 <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>There are three main drivers of modal choice for passengers (De Jong &amp; Van Riet, 2008): income <lb/>levels, relative user costs (including time costs) and public policy. As discussed in Section 2, higher <lb/>incomes lead to increased demand for transport services, in particular for car ownership and use. Higher <lb/>incomes also tend to imply higher opportunity costs of time, and this means an increased preference for <lb/>faster modes: at first car transport, then high speed rail and air transport which allow covering large <lb/>distances in short time frames. Population density and land use matter as well (see Section 4.2): high <lb/>population densities are necessary for rail, light rail and metro solutions to become economically <lb/>attractive. Finally, public policy affects modal choice. Public transport solutions like busses and rail are <lb/>characterized by economies of density and by economies of scale (although scale economies for bus <lb/>operations are exhausted in even medium sized cities). It is very costly to construct a railway track but <lb/>once in place, the variable cost of a train is low and roughly constant (as long as the network is not <lb/>congested). In addition, with more users, the occupancy rates increase, so that more vehicles need to be <lb/>deployed, so increasing the frequency of public transport services and reducing waiting times at stops <lb/>(Mohring, 1972). <lb/>3.1.1 <lb/>Urban transport <lb/>Except for minibuses in developing countries and a few isolated exceptions, investment and even <lb/>operation costs of urban public transport are subsidized. The main justifications are the economies of <lb/>scale and second best pricing in urban areas where the external congestion and air pollution costs of car <lb/>use are not reflected in prices. Experience with public transport subsidies differs a lot among the different <lb/>continents and has given rise to fierce debate among economists. The optimization of public transport <lb/>fares on existing networks points to high subsidy rates when the external costs of car use are not reflected <lb/>in car use costs (see e.g. Proost and Van Dender, 2008 and Parry and Small, 2009) where even operation <lb/>costs are subsidized at more than 50%. However, high subsidies are no guarantee for a highly performing <lb/>public transit system. Winston &amp; Maheshri (2007) find that the US public rail systems are heavily <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>15 <lb/>subsidized but not welfare improving, except for the BART in San Francisco. In many countries, light rail <lb/>systems have been absorbing a disproportionately large share of the public transport investments without <lb/>solid economic justification. <lb/>Duranton &amp; Turner (2010) found evidence for the fundamental law of road congestion in the US <lb/>cities: over the period 1983-2003 transport volumes increased proportionally to highway capacity. They <lb/>found that individual as well as commercial traffic increased with the stock of roads in their city and that <lb/>cities with less congestion attract people. This implies that an increase in urban road transport is partly <lb/>generated by the new road capacity, so public policy matters. Second, they tested the full effect of a small <lb/>increase in highway capacity and found that, given the absence of congestion pricing, for most areas, the <lb/>costs of the investment were lower than the benefits. This does not imply that there are no beneficial road <lb/>investment projects but that these projects need also to be submitted to a rigorous economic analysis. <lb/>Finally, also these authors found that, in the US, the provision of public transport had no impact on <lb/>volumes of car transport. <lb/>Darido et al. (2009) compare broad policy approaches in Beijing and Shangai, showing how the <lb/>former focused on providing road capacity and the latter on mixed and dense development and restrictive <lb/>car use policies, with obvious effects on modal split and CO2-emissions. This clearly illustrates how <lb/>strategic policy choices can affect development, and the resulting diversity in spatial structures is <lb/>beneficial in itself. <lb/>3.1.2. <lb/>Non urban transport <lb/>For the medium distance passenger transport, the main competing modes are car, bus and rail. <lb/>For the long distance (beyond 300km) HSR and air are the most important. Rail and HSR display strong <lb/>economies of scale and require a high patronage to be justified economically. HSR needs huge up front <lb/>investments and has low variable costs. An efficient HSR system requires high public investment <lb/>subsidies, fares that cover more or less the marginal operation costs, and a large market. de Rus &amp; Nash, <lb/></body>

			<body>2007, and ITF, 2010,b estimate that in the most favourable circumstances (low construction cost and <lb/>distance of 500km), one needs a minimum of 6 to 9 million passengers in the first year to justify a <lb/>HSR-project; When the investment costs are mainly paid by public money, the door is wide open for <lb/>political lobbying. In the EU, China and Japan, governments have opted for a highly subsidized network of <lb/>HSR. In North America, no HSR system has yet been built. The current administration favours this <lb/>solution, but only limited funding has been made available to date. <lb/>Air transport clearly is the main alternative for long distance trips. Air transport is less fuel efficient <lb/>per passenger kilometre than rail and it also generates more external noise costs (Maibach et al. 2007). In <lb/>a study of all the main HSR projects in the EU, Adler et al. (2010) find that some HSR projects are <lb/>economically justified on condition that prices reflect marginal costs and not average costs. They find also <lb/>that the environmental disadvantages of air transport are not at all sufficient to justify the HSR <lb/>investments. This limited environmental appeal is further reduced when account is taken of the emissions <lb/>during the construction phase, where high-speed rail is at a disadvantage. Furthermore, if environmental <lb/>and energy concerns dominate, then the more energy-efficient conventional rail may be preferable over <lb/>the high speed option. <lb/>In summary, the economic analysis casts doubt on the validity of modal split as an intermediate <lb/>policy objective in the case of passenger transport. Rail and bus have a role to play in some markets, in <lb/>particular where densities of demand are very high. But to pursue modal change towards these modes <lb/>across the board can be a costly policy mistake. The rationale for investing in high-speed rail and bus lies <lb/>mainly in the spatial density of demand, much less – if at all – in environmental performance. There is a <lb/>striking difference between the policy options taken in the US and in the EU and Asia. This is partly a <lb/>reflection of different types of economic geography and spatial development. With differences in distances <lb/>and densities, different transport options regarding e.g. HSR and air can be economically justified. <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>17 <lb/>3.2 <lb/>Modal choice for freight transportation <lb/>Up to 100 years ago the location of economic activities and cities was directly determined by <lb/>transport costs, as driven by access to railroads, ports and inland waterways. Since then the road network <lb/>has expanded dramatically and freight costs have declined strongly. This has given rise to relocation of <lb/>economic activity and a higher share for road freight transport at the expense of rail and inland waterways. <lb/>Road (and air) freight can be up to 10 times less fuel efficient than freight rail and a factor 100 or <lb/>more less fuel efficient than waterborne freight. So why did the shares of rail and inland waterway <lb/>shipping decline over time at road freight&apos;s expense? Explanations include changes in the nature of the <lb/>goods moved, the rising importance of speed and flexibility, and institutional factors. As an example of the <lb/>latter, moving a freight train through different EU countries traditionally required a different locomotive and <lb/>driver for every country that was crossed. In the US, in contrast, often one company organizes freight from <lb/>coast to coast, and this is one (not the only) reason for the higher modal share of rail in the US compared <lb/>to Europe. <lb/>In the EU, one of the main policy orientations of the last 15 years has been to discourage the <lb/>strong growth in road freight that accompanied the European integration process. In the CEC (2001) <lb/>paper, the policy objective was to approximately double the market share of both passenger and freight <lb/>rail traffic, which had fallen in 1998 to 6% (passenger) and 8% (freight) respectively. This required a <lb/>harmonization of procedures allowing the use of the same equipment and a single driver in different <lb/>countries. It also gave rise to a massive European subsidy program for rail investments. 4 Proost et al. <lb/>(2010) show that modal share objectives are not ideal for selecting investments.

It also came out that only a minority of the selected projects has any real European <lb/>value added in the sense of local investments benefiting other countries, so that the case for European <lb/>funds is weak overall. Lastly, the TEN-T projects are not situated systematically in the poorer regions of <lb/>the EU, so it is difficult to defend the selection on pure equity grounds (whereas &quot; cohesion &quot; traditionally <lb/>features large in EU policy strategies). <lb/>This example of the misallocation of funds for transport investments is not an exception. Knight <lb/>(2004) used the representative democracy model to analyze the decision making process applied to the <lb/>Interstate Highway Fund in the U.S.A. in the 1990s. The logic is that elected representatives try to favour <lb/>their own constituency. When they becomes agenda setters, they will form a winning majority of states by <lb/>selecting those states that are not costly to please in terms of public works and will use the opportunity to <lb/>favour their districts by selecting an oversupply of federally paid public works. Knight&apos;s findings suggest <lb/>that for every dollar invested, an additional dollar was wasted leading to the funding of a substantial <lb/>number of inefficient transport projects. <lb/>Overall, there are reasons to subsidize particular rail and inland waterways projects. Economies of <lb/>scale in rail and inland waterways require large investments and large public subsidies to operate the <lb/>infrastructure at their social marginal cost. However, the high public investment requirements have often <lb/>given rise to pork barrel politics and were not always justified in welfare terms. To reduce the probability of <lb/>wasteful use of public funds, it deserves recommendation to evaluate investment projects separately, <lb/>rather than build in an orientation towards modal shift at the strategic policy level. This is useful because it <lb/>recognizes that different modes work in different circumstances and avoids bias towards particular modes <lb/>through the adoption of artificial intermediate policy objectives like modal choice and greenhouse emission <lb/>limits for the transport sector. <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>19 <lb/>4. VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES <lb/>Greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks count for the bulk of GHG emissions in the <lb/>transport sector. 5 In the short term, one counts on the improvement of conventional engines to reduce <lb/>GHG (cf. Anderson et al., 2010). In the longer term new vehicle technologies that use other fuels could <lb/>deliver reductions of GHG emissions and avoid oil dependency and/or oil depletion. We discuss three <lb/>questions in this regard. First, how costly and environmentally efficient are these alternative technologies? <lb/>Second, what is the willingness of consumers to adopt them? And third, do car manufacturers have <lb/>sufficient incentives to develop the new technologies? <lb/>4.1 <lb/>New car technologies <lb/>Table 2 lists the technologies that could play a role at the 2020-2040 horizon, according to IEA <lb/>(2009). We start with the characteristics of new cars in the US and in the EU. Taking as basis (index=100) <lb/>the GHG emissions per vehicle mile in the OECD, one sees that there is a difference of 25% between US <lb/>and EU GHG emissions for new cars in 2010. Several factors are responsible for this but the dominant <lb/>factor is probably the difference in gasoline taxes and other car-related taxes. In the US, the tax on <lb/>gasoline is 17% of the resource cost, in the EU it can be 160% or more. 6 This implies an effective CO2 tax <lb/>(called gasoline tax) of 47 $/ ton of CO2 in the US and 365 €/ton of CO2 in the EU. In some EU countries, <lb/>diesel cars have a market share of over 50%. They are more fuel efficient but emit more conventional <lb/>pollutants (mainly highly damaging particulates even if a particulate trap is installed, Maibach et al., 2007). <lb/>5 According to IEA&apos;s MoMo-model, light-duty vehicles and freight trucks account for 70% of global tank-to-wheel <lb/>emissions of CO2 from transport, <lb/></body>

			<body>Car choices depend on fuel taxes but also on ownership or purchase taxes. Braathen (2009) <lb/>shows how tax schedules vary strongly among European countries and how taxes rise very strongly with <lb/>emission ratings in some cases. <lb/>For 2020-2040, it is not yet clear what type of cars will be used but it is likely that improved <lb/>conventional cars will still dominate the market. If the EU and Japan continue to use high taxes on <lb/>gasoline and diesel and if evermore stringent emission standards are used in an increasing number of <lb/>countries, new cars may emit only 50% as much as existing new cars for the same mileage, at an extra <lb/>cost of up to $2000/vehicle (Table 2). This requires a combination of engine improvements, weight <lb/>reduction, better aerodynamics, reduced rolling resistance, etc. Some design choices will imply reducing <lb/>other desirable vehicle attributes, including size, comfort, and possibly (and more controversially) safety. If <lb/>current incentives are not re-enforced, emission reductions for conventional cars may be limited to 20%. <lb/>The next step, after the improved gasoline and diesel cars, are the hybrid cars. These are already <lb/>on the market but can become more efficient. They can offer an extra 20% saving compared to improved <lb/>gasoline and diesel cars, at a cost per vehicle of $2000 to $4000 compared to the standard gasoline and <lb/>diesel car. They are more expensive but have the advantage that they can bridge the gap with electric <lb/>cars. The intermediate technology is the plug-in-hybrid that has a larger battery to take power from the <lb/>grid but can still rely on a small combustion engine for longer trips. <lb/>The GHG reduction potential of plug-in-hybrids and electric vehicles depends ultimately on the <lb/>emissions associated with the production of electricity. If electricity production is mainly coal based (as <lb/>expected in the US, China and India), one needs well performing carbon capture and storage (CCS) <lb/>technologies before electric vehicles can deliver savings in GHG emissions compared to improved <lb/>conventional vehicles. Even where the base load on the electrical grid is produced in a low carbon manner <lb/>(nuclear or wind), the marginal load can be considerably more carbon-intensive, and transitioning to <lb/>broader low carbon loads takes time. Plug-in-hybrid and pure electric cars come at an extra cost of $7500 <lb/>to over $10000/vehicle. They also have a more limited range and less trunk space. While improvements <lb/></body>

			<body>will be made, it is not obvious that electric cars will become very close substitutes for conventional cars. <lb/>They may be sufficiently appealing for some market segments (e.g. multiple vehicle households in rich <lb/>economies), but expecting them to conquer the market overall appears unduly optimistic for the period up <lb/>to 2040. Electric mobility may be part of the solution for decarbonising transport, but it is not a panacea. <lb/>4.2 <lb/>Low GHG fuels <lb/>Apart from turning to more efficient conventional cars and electric cars, a third route to saving <lb/>GHG emissions in the road sector is to use low-carbon fuels, e.g. biodiesel, ethanol, and compressed <lb/>natural gas. These fuels can be used in conventional engines but require an additional distribution <lb/>infrastructure. Furthermore, when the whole fuel cycle is taken into account, several of these fuels deliver <lb/>no or only small GHG emission reductions and there are concerns about general equilibrium effects in <lb/>non-fuel markets (notably food prices). After the initial enthusiasm, awareness of the limitations of biofuels <lb/>has risen, and research into better performing fuels continues. As with electric vehicles, it seems that <lb/>biofuels can play a role in reducing road (or air) transport emissions, but setting quantity targets for their <lb/>deployment risks obtaining few real reductions at a high cost per unit. The other alternative fuel -<lb/>hydrogen-delivers GHG emission savings only if it is made with low carbon electricity, vehicle and <lb/>distribution costs are high. We see little scope for this solution over the next two or three decades. <lb/>4.3 <lb/>Consumer attitudes and government policies <lb/>Our second question, the attitude of consumers to new car technologies, has been studied <lb/>extensively since the 1990s as the state of California wanted zero emission vehicles to reach a significant <lb/>market share. Most non standard technologies offer a smaller range (pure electric vehicles), smaller trunk <lb/>space (natural gas, electric vehicles), smaller size (very fuel efficient vehicles etc.) and lower speed and <lb/>acceleration. Consumers&apos; purchase decisions are based on a subjective assessment of these and other <lb/>vehicle characteristics, given expected patterns of use and energy prices. The value of the various <lb/></body>

			<body>attributes can be estimated using revealed and stated preference techniques (see e.g. Brownstone et al., <lb/>2000) and the values can be integrated into the &quot; fair &quot; comparison of alternative technologies. This <lb/>technique can be used for any new type of vehicle technology. <lb/>The results show that with a sufficient price discount, some consumers are prepared to accept the <lb/>discomfort of certain new technologies. Sometimes there even is even a &quot; green glow &quot; effect to driving <lb/>more costly cars with a green image. Again, the evidence is that there is a market for alternative <lb/>technologies but that one should not expect conventional technologies to be swept away as long as the <lb/>alternatives can&apos;t compete on key attributes, including purchase price and expected user costs. <lb/>What will drive the government policies in the car sector? There are four main concerns: climate <lb/>change, the tax base, the security of oil supply, and profits and employment in the domestic car industry. <lb/>With respect to climate change, the probability that a general and strong global climate agreement is <lb/>signed and observed is small because climate change is a pure public bad and abatement benefits are <lb/>uncertain and come only in the very long run. As long as alternative car technologies remain expensive, it <lb/>is rather unlikely that there will be widespread adoption of the least carbon-intensive technologies, simply <lb/>because the threat of climate change cannot be translated into a credible policy commitment to cooperate <lb/>in the R&amp;D phase and stimulate such widespread adoption (Barrett, 2006). However, for a big country that <lb/>wants to continue a climate policy in a non-cooperative world, developing low GHG car technologies and <lb/>transferring them to the rest of the world could be an important element of its strategy (see Barla &amp; Proost, <lb/>2008). Actually, Europe and Japan have in the past developed more fuel efficient cars that can be used in <lb/>the US, China, India etc. It appears, hence, that government policies are as much steered by strategic <lb/>industrial and trade considerations as by environmental concerns. A deeper understanding the different <lb/>national fuel efficiency policies as strategic trade policies, e.g. along the lines of Ulph and Ulph (2007), is <lb/>needed. 7 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">7 Whether Europe and Japan will be able to maintain leadership in producing fuel-efficient cars is not clear.

			<body>24 <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>There is a second reason why the adoption of technologies that use alternative fuels will be <lb/>limited. In many countries with high gasoline taxes, alternative fuels like electricity, natural gas and <lb/>biodiesel are subject to much lower excise duties than traditional fuels. This strong tax incentive is <lb/>unsustainable for the tax authorities who see their revenue base eroded in case of a large shift towards <lb/>lower-taxed fuels. Of course removing the tax advantage makes alternative fuels less attractive. The <lb/>political tension between environmental and public finance concerns shifts over time, but the latter <lb/>ultimately tend to weigh heavily on decisions. In addition, it is expected – or hoped – that countries sooner <lb/>or later move away from an energy-based taxation system for road transport towards one based on <lb/>distance, time of day and place (see e.g. NTPP, 2009, and Anas and Lindsey, 2010, this symposium). 8 <lb/>The price increases necessary to contain other externalities will keep traffic from growing too strongly but <lb/>abandoning fuel or energy as the main tax base means that the progress to more fuel efficient cars will be <lb/>based mainly on technologies that are already available (see Proost et al., 2009). <lb/>Higher oil prices and the concern for oil supply security are in principle an extra incentive to <lb/>reduce the oil consumption in the road sector. As long as this reduction takes the form of more fuel <lb/>efficient vehicles, the oil security concern and the climate concern work in the same direction. Whenever <lb/>the oil import concern implies the use of more non-conventional fuel, both concerns can diverge as the <lb/>production of some non-conventional fuel generates much higher CO2 emissions. <lb/>Finally, in this debate, the interaction between long-run and short-run policy approaches needs <lb/>consideration for two reasons. First, in the short run conventional vehicles are made more efficient, <lb/>switching to alternative technologies is more difficult (all else equal). Second as both oil reserves and <lb/>10% in 2007; its share in global triadic patent families increases from 0.1% to 1.1% over the same period (OECD, <lb/>2010). <lb/></body>

TRANSPORT AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE <lb/>The distribution of economic activity over space co-determines transport patterns and volumes. <lb/>Conversely, transport costs co-determine the location of economic activity. Section 4.1 reviews key <lb/>insights from the new economic geography, focusing on agglomeration economies. Adopting a narrower, <lb/>microscopic perspective, Section 4.2 summarizes theoretical and applied work on the relation between <lb/>urban spatial structure and transport volumes. More specifically, the widespread view that urban sprawl <lb/>leads to excessive transport volumes and thus justifies land-use policies, is investigated. This debate <lb/>matters for greenhouse gas emissions for two reasons. First, transport activity is a direct source of <lb/>emissions. Second, urban density affects also the energy use for heating and cooling via the size and type <lb/>of dwellings. <lb/>5.1 <lb/>Transport and agglomeration <lb/>The spatial distribution of activities obviously is an important driver of transport demand. <lb/>Passenger transport flows are dependent on the locations of workplace, school, recreation facilities, <lb/>shops, etc. Freight transport flows depend on the organization of production and the location of input and <lb/>output markets. In the other direction, location choices (at any level of spatial resolution) depend on <lb/>transport costs. <lb/>The new economic geography provides a macroscopic (yet microeconomic) framework that helps <lb/>get a grip on the evolution of the spatial distribution of economic activity, through its focus on the location <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>decisions of firms, workers and consumers. We do not aim to summarize the main insights of this work <lb/>here; see Fujita and Thisse, 2002. At its core, the new economic geography (NEG) identifies a tradeoff for <lb/>location choices between transport costs and scale economies. The latter can be internal to firms, <lb/>favouring concentration of production in fewer plants, and can be external, favouring agglomeration of <lb/>economic activity in fewer locations (cities). The external benefits of agglomeration originate from lower <lb/>transport costs of intermediate inputs, labour market pooling and exchange of ideas. The concentration of <lb/>economic activity in cities hence boosts productivity. <lb/>However, the decision to locate in a city also depends on intra-urban transport costs that are often <lb/>ignored in the NEG. Within a city, congestion of fixed factors puts a brake on agglomeration through high <lb/>property prices that result partly from high travel times on transport networks. Transport costs between <lb/>cities or markets matter as well. When they are high, the tendency to concentrate production is weaker <lb/>because getting goods to faraway markets costs more. The historical decline in transport costs therefore <lb/>has been an important impetus for continued concentration of economic activity. <lb/>Recently, agglomeration economies have received attention in the context of the appraisal of <lb/>intra-regional transport investment. If there are external agglomeration economies and if transport <lb/>infrastructure contributes to their exploitation, then there are benefits to transport investments over and <lb/>above those included in standard project appraisal (which focuses on effects on transport users, under the <lb/>standard assumptions of cost-benefit analysis). The Eddington Study (2006), for example, argues that <lb/>agglomeration economies ought to be taken into account on the basis of empirical evidence. Doing so <lb/>increases the returns to transport investment on average, and differentiates between projects on the basis <lb/>of where they improve transport conditions. Ellison et al. (2010) find for US manufacturing sector that <lb/>sharing of goods (inter-industry deliveries), labour market pooling and transfer of ideas all contribute more <lb/>or less equally to explain agglomeration but that inter-industry linkages are somewhat more important. It <lb/>is, however, not clear how strong the empirical case for accounting for agglomeration economies is at this <lb/>stage, see Graham and Van Dender (2009). <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/></note>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>The new economic geography analysis differs from the &quot; fixed location &quot; view that is common in <lb/>transport economics, and highlights that decisions on what transport networks to develop have a direct <lb/>and long-lasting impact on where economic activity will take place and how efficient it will be. Ideally, <lb/>these location effects should be taken into account in appraisal but the state of the art of research <lb/>probably does not yet allow the construction of models that provide concrete, project-specific policy <lb/>guidance. <lb/>5.2 <lb/>Passenger transport and urban sprawl <lb/>Whereas much of transport economics takes locations of households and firms as given, urban <lb/>economics has focused on tradeoffs between transport and property or rental costs in location decisions. <lb/>A stylized fact in this context is that many households favour living in relatively low-density urbanized <lb/>environments, and employers choose to locate out of city centres in response to high central city prices. <lb/>Where legislation and other framework conditions allow it (or favour it 9 ), the result is urban development <lb/>with fairly low-densities and decentralized distribution of employment. This pattern is particularly prevalent <lb/>in – but not unique to – the postwar United States, and is often labelled as urban sprawl. Sprawl has a <lb/>negative connotation, being associated with a range of problems. For example, decentralization and low <lb/>densities are thought to generate lifestyles that induce excessive car travel and energy consumption. <lb/>Travel survey data indeed suggest a strong dependence of distances travelled on residential <lb/>density (a common but imperfect indicator for sprawl). Table 3 shows the relation for the US in 1995, and <lb/>clarifies that density has hardly an impact on the number of trips but a large impact on average annual <lb/>distance travelled, with households in the least dense areas travelling 20% more than the average <lb/>household and households in the most dense areas travelling 25% less. At first sight, then, sprawl (lower <lb/>density development) would seem to inflate travel distances by increasing average trip lengths. Apart from <lb/></body>

The evidence in Table 3 suggests this <lb/>effect appears to play mostly at very high densities. 10 Trip distances are one possible explanation, as with <lb/>very short trips non-motorised modes become feasible. Alternatively, access to transit, or different <lb/>transport demand patterns of households choosing to reside where densities are high, may matter (see <lb/>below). <lb/>Table 3.

Before considering the evidence, however, we <lb/>ask to what extent the popular argument that urban development patterns affect transport choices and <lb/>that therefore urban sprawl justifies land-use policy. . <lb/>Basic microeconomics holds that urban sprawl is an issue for policy concern because of market <lb/>failures that render non-interventionist outcomes inefficient. Some important market failures associated <lb/>with development are that markets don&apos;t account for the benefits of open space and that they don&apos;t contain <lb/>a mechanism for charging developers for infrastructure. Furthermore, external costs of traffic congestion <lb/>and of energy consumption are not accounted for without policy. <lb/>10 Published travel survey data for the Netherlands for 2008 confirms that the share of car distance in total distance <lb/>drops strongly only at very high levels of density: the average share is 82% and it drops to 61% at density levels of <lb/>more than 25,000 addresses per square mile (MVW, 2009, Table 9). <lb/></div>

			<body>In order to control these externalities, well-targeted policies are required. External congestion <lb/>costs, and possibly local air pollution costs, ideally are reflected in congestion charges. Greenhouse gas <lb/>emissions are closely linked to fuel consumption, and hence are best dealt with through fuel taxes. Private <lb/>development choices can be steered through property and development taxes. There are two problems <lb/>with this line of reasoning. First, in practice, these ideal instruments are not implemented. Instead, a wide <lb/>range of instruments affect location decisions and transport costs, so that it is not ex ante clear in which <lb/>direction urban form is distorted, although the dominant view is that zoning policies and underpricing of <lb/>transport lead to too low densities. Second, when one allows for the development of new cities, the <lb/>optimal equilibrium may well contain more cities, more polycentricity and more sprawl (see Anas &amp; Pines, <lb/>2010). This is not unimportant when one considers the problems and growth of mega-cities in newly <lb/>developing countries that will see car ownership grow exponentially. <lb/>A particularly popular policy approach is to rely on command-and-control type of regulations that <lb/>directly regulate land-use by stipulating what kind of development is allowed where. When they are <lb/>enforceable, such instruments certainly are effective, i.e. they produce tangible results. However, they are <lb/>not necessarily cost-effective (i.e. the results may be obtained at too high a cost) or efficient (i.e. the <lb/>results don&apos;t necessarily coincide with what an efficient market would produce). Hence, direct regulations <lb/>can only be justified when there are severe restrictions on better targeted instruments and when the extra <lb/>costs of using command-and-control approaches are worth incurring. <lb/>As indicated above, recent empirical studies investigate whether the strong link between residential <lb/>density and travel distance, as shown in Table 3, implies an equally strong causal connection in the sense <lb/>of higher density reducing travel distance; for a detailed review, see NRC, 2009. Work using <lb/>disaggregated data shows that this causal link exists but is not as strong as it appears at first sight. The <lb/>reason is that households sort into particular locations on the basis of their preferences (captured through <lb/>observed and non-observed characteristics), and those preferences partially explain transport choices <lb/>rather than density alone. The result is that no major reductions in transport volumes or energy <lb/></body>

			<body>consumption should be expected unless truly drastic changes in land-use are brought about (Bento et al., <lb/>2005, Brownstone and Golob, 2009). Brownstone and Golob (2009) find that, for two Californian <lb/>households that are otherwise identical in observed characteristics, a difference in residential density of <lb/>1,000 housing units per square mile (40% of the sample mean) leads to 1,171 fewer miles driven and 64.7 <lb/>less gallons of gasoline consumed per year; this is 4.7% and 5.5% of the sample mean, respectively. Of <lb/>the change in gasoline consumption, about 2/3 is due to less driving and 1/3 to the fact that households in <lb/>denser areas tend to own more fuel-efficient vehicles. Changing driving and energy consumption by about <lb/>5% of course is not negligible, but it is highly doubtful that changing density by 40% is feasible in all but a <lb/>limited number of circumstances. According to evidence mentioned in Brownstone and Golob (2009), <lb/>about 6.6% of 456 US cities increased population density by more than 40% between 1950 and 1990 (and <lb/>those that did tended to experience declining living conditions), while in the median city it declined by <lb/>36%. The NRC Special Report (NRC, 2009) concludes that the potential of anti-sprawl policies is limited, <lb/>insisting nevertheless that this limited potential should be exploited, by removing excessive constraints on <lb/>development and – ultimately – consumer choice. 11 <lb/>A potential message for newly (re-)developing cities could be that rapid declines of density along <lb/>the US model ought to be avoided if energy use is to be contained. However, such policies can be costly <lb/>in terms of welfare and probably are justified only when the shadow price of carbon is high. Even with <lb/>stringent decarbonisation targets, there are less costly policies than those that focus on discouraging <lb/>driving for the sake of energy saving alone (Van Dender, 2009). In addition, reducing sprawl to residential <lb/>density can produce misleading results on the connection between urban spatial structure and travel <lb/>needs, as the latter depend on other factors as well. For example, a monocentric city likely displays longer <lb/>commutes on average than a polycentric city of the same residential density. Gaigné et al. (2010) point <lb/>out that polycentricity under many circumstances may be a better way to contain travel demand and <lb/>energy consumption than striving for a more compact city, especially because making one city more <lb/></body>

			<body>compact may well mean that another becomes more sprawled. This general equilibrium view, <lb/>emphasizing that it is the overall outcome that matters and not just what happens in one city, is also <lb/>discussed in Glaeser and Kahn (2010). Taking such a global view naturally leads one to favour carbon <lb/>taxes instead of local policies to handle emissions of greenhouse gases. <lb/>6. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Road and air transport, two less energy efficient modes of transport, will continue to expand. Road <lb/>use in emerging economics will soon account for more than half of the world car and truck use. This paper <lb/>has analyzed three types of policy levers to address the growing GHG emissions and congestion <lb/>externalities associated to this development. <lb/>Modal switch from road and air to rail and inland waterways offers in theory a huge potential. <lb/>However, the vigorous pursuit of modal shift in the EU shows that such a shift is justified only when the <lb/>spatial density of demand is sufficiently high. The environmental and congestion performance of rail and <lb/>canals is in general a bad guide for massive investments in these modes. <lb/>Over the last 20 years, technological developments for cars and trucks have allowed to reduce <lb/>conventional air pollution by a factor 5 or so. Achieving the same level of progress for GHG emissions will <lb/>be difficult. The fuel efficient cars sold where fuel taxes are high can be adopted in the rest of the world. If <lb/>the policy of high gasoline taxes and strict fuel efficiency standards is continued, the conventional car <lb/>technology can become 50% more efficient and is therefore likely to stay around for the next 20 to <lb/>40 years. Plug-in hybrids smoothen the transition to the electric vehicle. Compared to the improved <lb/>combustion engines, the electric car technology is only interesting in terms of GHG emissions if the <lb/>32 <lb/>Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14 <lb/>electric power production is itself not very GHG-intensive and this implies requires Carbon Capture and <lb/>Storage in most regions. <lb/>Transport needs are the result of the spatial distribution of activities. Policy makers are tempted to <lb/>use land use planning to increase residential densities and to limit commuting distances. These policies <lb/>have a rather limited potential because lower densities result from non-internalized externalities but also <lb/>from a preference for low density. In addition, our limited understanding of location choices implies that <lb/>well-intentioned policies can have widely diverging outcomes. <lb/>Our overview of policy challenges related to congestion and climate change, and of proposed solutions <lb/>shows that containing overall transport volumes is very difficult, and is only justified in some cases rather <lb/>than as a general strategy. Reducing the sector&apos;s carbon footprint will to a large extent be a technological <lb/>challenge. Here, progress is being made, and fuel economy can be improved at moderate costs. Whether <lb/>such improvements will actually materialize is a matter of strong policy commitment to decarbonisation <lb/>goals. Whether reducing carbon emissions in transport is the cheapest way of attaining decarbonisation <lb/>targets is not obvious either. <lb/></body>
