            <figDesc>On the 2009 PISA reading assessment, girls outperformed boys in every country, and on average<lb/> by 39 score points – the equivalent of one year of schooling. By contrast, boys tend to outperform<lb/> girls in mathematics.<lb/> An estimated 66% of young women in OECD countries are expected to enter a university<lb/> programme during their lifetime, compared to 52% of young men.<lb/> Men are more likely than women to hold advanced research qualifications, and 74% of all graduates<lb/> in the fields of engineering, manufacturing and construction are men.<lb/> Higher (tertiary) education improves job prospects for both men and women, and the gender<lb/> gap in employment narrows at the highest levels of educational attainment.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>For instance, the proportion of women who are expected<lb/> to enter a university programme rose from 51% in 2000 to 66% in 2009, while the proportion of men<lb/> who are expected to enter these programmes rose from 42% in 2000 to 52% in 2009.<lb/> Across OECD countries, the proportion of women who hold a university-level qualification now<lb/> equals or exceeds that of men in 29 of the 32 countries for which data are comparable. On average,<lb/> 59% of all graduates who held a first university degree in 2009 are women; this proportion is<lb/> below 50% only in China, Japan, Korea and Turkey.</figDesc>
