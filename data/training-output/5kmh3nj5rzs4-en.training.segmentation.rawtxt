ELECTRIFICATION POLICIES 
IN EMERGING ECONOMIES Keys to successful policies 2010 March INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in 
November 1974. Its mandate is two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member 
countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply and to advise member 
countries on sound energy policy. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among 28 advanced 
economies, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. 
The Agency aims to: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, 
through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection 
in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute 
to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of 
energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies 
and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy 
efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement 
and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, 
international organisations and other stakeholders. IEA member countries:

While many of the challenges faced by these countries are similar, the means of addressing them 
varied in their application and effectiveness. On the basis of our analysis of these four country 
profiles, we have determined the prerequisites to successful rural electrification policies. 1: Preconditions to successful rural electrification policies  Sound statistical data on populations' geographical distribution and a clear description 
of the electrification situation are essential if governments are to avoid the risk of 
overlooking remote population groups and to facilitate the choice of end-use. 
 Sustained government support and long-term funding will guarantee a more effective 
implementation of electrification objectives, and the elimination of any misuse of 
electrification funds in favour of other objectives. 
 Dedicated institutional structures and independence from political agendas ensure that 
funds are  " ring-fenced " , efforts are durable and electrification objectives are not 
interfered with according to politicians' personal agendas. 
 The establishment of a strong market infrastructure to attract private investors ensures 
the wider use of stand-alone systems in remote areas. 
 Related policies and/or regulations including energy efficiency policies should be 
implemented alongside the electrification process to sustain long-term economic 
development. 
 Connection costs should be eliminated or spread over time so as to minimise any 
upfront hindrances to being connected, and electricity tariffs should be affordable but 
not necessarily subsidised. 
 Effective metering, billing and payment recovery ensure the long-term viability of the 
electricity supplier and therefore of the electrification process as a whole. 
 Full involvement of the rural communities in the electrification efforts throughout the 
decision-making process increases their sense of ownership and brings support to 
utilities' efforts to encourage customers to use electricity wisely once they are 
connected. 2: Stand-alone systems: conditions for successful rural 
electrification efforts  Locally-produced and resource-specific technologies for electrification will reduce the 
need to import systems and facilitate their use in any given region. 
 Good management and maintenance of the systems require adequate training, 
assistance services and customer supply chains for their long-term use. 
 Sufficient long-term funding ensures long-term system maintenance. 
 Banning the idea that stand-alone systems provide  " second-class "  electricity gives 
communities a sense of ownership of the system. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 10 3: Grid extension: conditions for successful rural 
electrification efforts  Reduction of transmission and distribution losses keeps costs of electrification under 
control. 
 Reduction of losses due to electricity theft ensures suppliers' longer-term viability. 
 The use of low-cost technologies keeps costs of electrification under control. 4: Three rural electrification boosters  Social fairness can be one of the initial driving motivators in the first stages of 
electrification. Indeed, economic development will follow sooner or later even when 
productive end-uses are not the prime objective to electrification. 
 Minimising trial and error through benchmarking and exchanges with other countries 
accelerate the electrification process. 
 Co-operation in the framework of IEA Implementing Agreements for exchanges on 
technologies and support in policy formulation will spur the electrification process and 
facilitate long-term collaboration with other countries on other policy and technology 
issues of interest. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 11 Introduction Since the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Networks of Expertise 
in Energy Technology (NEET) Initiative 1 has sought to encourage further involvement of major emerging 
economies in the IEA Technology Network comprising international energy technology and R&D 
collaborative programmes. Missions and workshops when feasible have been organised in the so-called 
 " Plus-Five "  countries, namely Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. These outreach efforts have 
been geared towards identifying areas of mutually desirable and potential future collaboration between 
experts of these major emerging economies and the IEA Technology Network including the Committee 
on Energy Research and Technology (CERT), Working Parties (WP) and Implementing Agreements (IA). 2 Rural electrification has been singled out as a potential field for international collaborative activities within 
the IEA framework. Policy makers, industries and R&D institutions in the targeted economies have all 
expressed interest in discussing with one another and with international experts, in exchanging their 
experiences, lessons learned and continuing challenges in their efforts to bring energy services to the rural 
world. In response to this interest, the IEA has begun exploring its role as facilitator of international 
exchanges on energy technologies and policies for rural electrification in developing economies. In May 2008, the IEA hosted a workshop on  " Sustainable Rural Energisation in Major Emerging 
Economies " , in collaboration with the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and with 
the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Renewable Energy 
Policy Network for the 21 st Century (REN21). The goal of this workshop was to explore opportunities 
for extending IEA's collaborative activities to better respond to the major emerging economies' 
interest in international collaboration on rural energisation. 3 Delegates from eleven emerging 
economies, namely Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, 
Pakistan and South Africa, met representatives from nine IEA Implementing Agreement (IA) 
programmes and from interested government and international bodies. This was an opportunity for 
IAs to display their collaborative activities and discuss with the country representatives on how to 
join forces in carrying forward existing efforts. Specific goals were also to establish to what degree 
the emerging economies are committed to such collaboration and to identify the preferred vehicle. 
The key messages emerging from the workshop highlighted the importance of a constructive 
dialogue and a  " made-to-measure " , non-prescriptive approach. Participants also noted the need to 
have the IEA as a focal point for information exchanges not only between the IEA countries and 
emerging economies, but also among the latter. They noted that rural energy decision makers 
required support in adapting policies to local conditions and that assistance was needed in 
technology transfer and capacity building, both technical and policy-related. They encouraged 
further work on policy benchmarking and invited the IEA to undertake a comparative analysis of the 
effectiveness and efficiency of national and regional policies to accelerate rural energisation. 1 For more information on the IEA's NEET Initiative, refer to http://www.iea.org/neet

http://www.iea.org/textbase/work/workshopdetail.asp?WS_ID=379 Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 12 This paper directly stems from the conclusions of this workshop. It describes the rural electrification 
policies adopted by the four major emerging economies, with a view to analysing the keys to the 
successful implementation of such policies. 4 Rural electrification: main challenges and issues Roughly 22% of the world's population still does not have access to electricity. In 2008, this 
represented 1.5 billion people, most of whom lived in remote areas often difficult to access and 
therefore to connect to national or regional grids. The International Energy Agency estimates that 
roughly 85% of the people without electricity live in rural areas in developing countries, mostly in 
peri-urban or remote rural areas (IEA, 2009b). Today, most of these people are found in sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia. The IEA predicts that in 2030, if no new policy to alleviate energy 
poverty is introduced, 1.3 billion people (some 16% of the total world population) will still be denied 
electricity most of whom in South Asia and Africa (IEA, 2009b). Not all electrification policies target poor rural households. Some also target a mix of farms, big 
villages and small towns all of which call for different technologies. In fact, rural electrification 
policies are shaped according to the various energy needs, resources and target groups. Electrifying 
the suburb of a major Indian city obviously poses problems that are different from those of a 
remote village in China. As problems are far greater in rural areas than in urban settings (Barnes, 
2007) we will focus our attention on electrification policies in favour of the world's rural poor. General challenges faced by rural communities Rural electrification is defined here as the process by which access to electricity is provided to households 
or villages located in the isolated or remote areas of a country. Remote or rural regions lacking electricity 
supply are often characterised by well identified challenges. They may lie at a reasonable distance from 
national or regional electricity grids (remote villages in the Amazon), may be difficult to access (far from 
urban centres with a difficult terrain such as large rivers or jungles), or may suffer harsh climatic conditions 
that render electrification through grid extension a perilous task. Rural communities are also often highly 
dispersed with a low population density and characterised by a low level of education, low load density 
generally concentrated at evening peak hours, and low revenues. Adding to these challenges, the rural 
poor without access to electricity either spend relatively large amounts of their scarce financial resources 
on energy, or a disproportionate amount of time collecting firewood. In light of these challenges, electricity provision to the world's rural poor calls for a committed and 
long-term action plan. The benefits that electricity access brings to households and communities 
are justified not only on social and economic grounds but also on grounds of equity objectives. Social benefits of electrification At the household level, electricity is mainly used for powering light bulbs, fans, television sets, 
computers and phones (when available). For over 30 years the World Bank and other organisations 
have studied the social benefits of electricity access and have noted that these benefits usually 
derive from the longer days that powered light bulbs offer to the household. In addition, access to 
information, communication and health care is facilitated by the powering of computers and 4 As a first step, rural electrification and not energisation is the focus of the paper. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 13 phones. When electricity is used for powering home appliances, household chores tend to become 
less tedious; when it is used for lighting, the relative brightness of the light bulb as opposed to 
candle light allows children to read or study in the later hours of the day, bringing obvious 
education and leisure benefits (Barnes, 2007). Women and children benefit directly from these 
improvements, but table or ceiling fans and television sets offer comfort during evening leisure 
time, increasing the general welfare of all members of the household. Economic benefits of electrification Besides the social benefits, decision makers tend to give more importance to the economic impact 
of access to electricity as an income-generating process. Electricity use is expected to lead to more 
productive processes; the growth of businesses or farms using electricity will then increase demand 
for electricity, leading to a virtuous growth cycle profitable to both electricity providers and rural 
communities. Such economic growth is obviously an important achievement of any rural 
electrification programme. Some experts (Barnes, 2007), however, warn that the necessary 
conditions for such economic growth lie in the parallel or complementary development 
programmes for the newly electrified communities. While electricity is indeed an important input to 
rural businesses, farms or other small rural structures, adequate local conditions such as organised 
rural markets and sufficient credit are necessary for such businesses to grow. Lack of such 
complementary development programmes in these regions may hinder their economic growth. Technologies commonly used in rural electrification policies Socially, ethically and economically beneficial, the electrification of rural or remote areas is usually 
high on the agenda of the leaders of major emerging economies, but the main problem to 
overcome is the choice of the technology. The choice of a specific energy technology for rural electrification naturally depends on the targeted 
country and on whether it is a whole region, community, business, farm or household that is to benefit 
from the process. But this is not the only concern. Issues of customer and load density, relative distance 
to the national or regional grid, landscape, availability of natural resources such as wind, sun, water, 
forests, economic and financial aspects, availability and maturity of any chosen technology, all these 
factors influence the decision maker in his choice of the technology or technology mix. The pool of potential energy technologies for rural electrification programmes is quite large and 
each technology naturally varies in its generation technique, its costs, and in the quality of the 
service it delivers. Depending in part on the degree of urbanisation of the targeted population, 
energy technologies used in electrification programmes generally involve national or regional grid 
extension, diesel generators, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), disposable batteries, kerosene lamps, 
renewable energies (including photovoltaic systems, wind energy, hydropower, and new wave 
energy and hydrogen) or hybrid systems. National or regional grid extension When aiming to electrify a rural community, the first question is its distance from a grid. If grid 
extension appears to be relatively easy (the region is near to the grid, flat landscape), is cost-
competitive with respect to other local autogenerators, and if the region's load density is 
considered sufficient, then grid extension will usually be a preferred option. In India for instance, Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 14 the first choice for a majority of the villages has been through grid extension. But many of the 
dispersed rural communities did not meet all these criteria at once. Grid extension was then the 
final phase of a sequential rural electrification process and other local electrification technologies 
were chosen in the meantime. In fact, once demand was built over the years by means of auto-
generation, and it became economically feasible to connect to the central grid, grid extension was 
chosen as a final step. Recently, however, mentalities have been changing and governments as well 
as rural communities are beginning to see stand-alone systems as long-term and reliable options for 
power generation, rendering grid extension less of a mandatory long-term means of electrification. Conventional systems Diesel generators, LPG, disposable batteries, paraffin (or kerosene) and biomass technologies have 
all been conventional means for dispersed populations to have access to electricity services. Today 
however, sustainability considerations are encouraging developing economies to focus their efforts, 
where possible, in deploying cleaner energy technologies such as renewable and more sustainable 
bioenergy applications. But diesel generators remain an attractive technology in rural 
electrification, mainly used in hybrid systems. Renewable energy systems Often considered the optimal means of bringing electricity to rural areas that cannot be connected 
to the grid, renewable energies offer notable environmental advantages over conventional fossil 
fuel technologies. The most widely used renewable energy technologies for rural electrification are 
described below. Photovoltaic (PV) power systems already provide electricity in developing countries to an estimated 
minimum of 500 000 to 1 million rural households without access to the grid (International Finance 
Corporation, 2007). Particularly attractive for countries with ample sunlight and whose rural electricity 
grid is poorly developed, PV systems can provide electricity to relatively dispersed populations but also 
to groups of houses or entire villages. The most common systems used in rural areas in developing 
countries are solar home systems (SHS), which have the potential to power light bulbs and small 
appliances such as televisions, radios or fans. Generally the capacity of the units used in rural households 
ranges from 30 to 100 peak watts, but their size varies (Erickson & Chapman, 1995). However, because 
of the systems' limited capacity, mechanisms are often needed to prevent excessive consumption by 
users. Currently, there is a move towards solar-diesel hybrid-powered mini-grids. Photo 1: School in South Africa powered by a photovoltaic system Source: Courtesy of Bernard Mc Nelis, IEA PVPS. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 15 Wind energy has a very high potential for rural electrification thanks to its intrinsic characteristics. 
Wind energy does not necessitate long-term centralised planning for its development as it is fast 
and simple to install. In most rural settings, when several smaller wind turbines are installed rather 
than a very large one, the grid can easily absorb wind generation. Successful examples of rural 
electrification based on wind power are the Atlantic islands of Canary, Azores and Cape Verde, 
where the high wind resource turns this renewable energy into among the most cost-effective 
power plants to install and operate. Small hydropower projects already provide electricity to millions of people throughout the world, 
with the largest deployment being in China. These power plants can vary in size from less than 
500 kW to about 10 MW and most are developed at the community level or for small industry. In 
addition to electricity, they also provide mechanical energy for small businesses, drinking water and 
irrigation through canals or pumps. While some small hydro plants use imported technology, there 
is an increased reliance on local manufacture. This provides employment opportunities over and 
above electricity to the communities. There remains a huge potential to increase the role of small 
hydro in supplying electricity to small, rural populations. Mini-hydropower plants are however often 
criticised for their inability to provide sufficient power to meet peak demand or for their excess 
capacity during off-peak periods. In order to limit the financial burden due to such tensions, 
consumers often have to either constrain their use of electricity during peak hours, or transfer their 
demand on to off-peak hours. Bioenergy already provides the main source of energy for heating and cooking for many millions of 
people in rural communities. Where adequate sources of biomass raw materials are available – for 
example from crop or forest residues – then these can also be used to generate electricity. This can 
be done in conjunction with larger plants which also use energy to process crops (for example the 
use of bagasse in sugar cane production). Alternatively smaller-scale systems based on biomass 
combustion or small-scale gasification can be used to generate electricity for local use. Moreover, 
biofuels such as non-edible straight vegetable oils (SVOs) produced from plants like Jatropha, can be 
directly used for transport applications and decentralised power generation or converted to 
biodiesel and blended with petro-diesel. Photo 2: Transporting fuel wood in Brazil Source: Courtesy J. Tustin, IEA Bioenergy IA. Ocean energy could play a significant role in enabling sustainable energisation of rural coastal and 
island regions of the developing countries by generating electricity, producing drinking water 
through desalination, or food through aquaculture, and cooling. This would however require 
appropriate policy instruments and real political will. Currently, project development activities are 
at an early stage in China, India, and Indonesia for providing electricity to rural households by 
harnessing energy from ocean waves and tidal currents. During 2007, Ponte di Archimede 
International S.p.A. entered into three joint ventures with the People's Republic of China, Indonesia Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 16 and the Philippines to install tidal current-based generation in remote villages. The Research and 
Technology Ministries in the respective countries participated actively in the formation of these 
ventures. The installation of tidal current projects of a similar size in remote villages is currently 
being planned in China and the Philippines. A 2 MW tidal current plant is being considered by India 
to bring electricity to a remote area near Sunderban in West Bengal. A low-temperature ocean 
thermal desalination (LTTD) plant has been operating since 2005 at Kavaratti in Lakshadweep 
islands in western India and that provides 100 m 3 per day of drinking water to a local community. 
There are also significant opportunities to utilise wave and tidal current energy for sustainable 
energisation of remote coastal areas in Mexico, Brazil and South Africa and activities are already 
under way in these countries. Hydrogen may well play a key role in distributed energy generation for which rural areas are prime 
candidates. Hydrogen "generators" (small-scale portable power devices such as reformers and fuel 
cells) may be substituted for the common diesel generators that are widely used. Hydrogen can also 
be used as fuel to power backup devices (larger fuel cells) and to provide combined heat and power 
(CHP). However, because it is innovative and new (at the demonstration and early market 
introduction stages) the typical household in rural settings would not be appropriate for hydrogen 
use. There are, however, some 400 stationary hydrogen demonstrations in the world. Unlike the 
photovoltaic industry or solar water-heating and cooling and other alternative technology industries 
which have started from scratch, hydrogen is already a large business with an infrastructure that 
can kick-start production, storage, delivery or energy applications as the deployment process 
continues. Hydrogen technologies may in the future bring innovation to the current supply of rural 
electrification technologies. Photo 3: Prince Edward Island (PEI) Wind-Hydrogen Village Project CanmetENERGY Source: Natural Resources Canada. Hybrid systems Hybrid systems are basically a combination of two or more different but complementary energy 
supply systems located on the same site. The advantage of hybrid systems is their ability to avoid 
fluctuations in the system's energy supply, which is the main disadvantage of stand-alone 
renewable energy technologies such as wind and PV. A hybrid system will provide a relatively 
constant delivery of energy even when one of the supply devices of the system is unable to 
generate power (lack of wind in the case of a windmill or of sunlight in the case of a PV). Often, 
hybrid systems will be a combination of different renewable energy technologies, sometimes 
coupled with diesel gen-sets. Typical hybrid systems are photovoltaic/wind systems, wind/diesel 
systems, wind/photovoltaic/micro hydropower systems, or wind/small hydropower and so forth. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 17 Typically, apart from local ambient conditions, economical and financial issues, the choice of which 
energy technology or mix of technologies to use for rural electrification will depend on whether the 
energy produced will be used for lighting or cooling purposes in a single household, or for 
productive processes (irrigation pumping, water supplies, crop processing, refrigeration, etc.) of 
businesses, agro-industries, small shops, and so on. A focus on government policies for rural electrification Most developing countries include rural electrification policies in their socio-political development 
efforts. The existing economic inequalities between urban and rural populations and these 
countries' social equity objectives tend to be the main drivers to providing electricity access to 
isolated populations. By doing this, governments of developing countries seek to improve the living 
standards of their rural populations and help them economically in order to help level out 
rural/urban disparities. Moreover, substantial upfront costs and long-term financial investments are 
required to accelerate the pace of rural electrification. Such financial security depends on 
government support. Efficient implementation of rural electrification programmes often needs regulations and market 
reforms, including market incentives through increased competition for private involvement and 
above all government involvement. Moreover, technical standards and norms can lead to an 
oversizing or costly infrastructure set-up for the electrification of rural households or villages, which 
will increase connection costs and the price of electricity. A reassessment of these standards and 
norms at the government level may prove necessary to alleviate the unnecessary additional 
financial burden from the electrification effort in rural areas. The following chapters will analyse countries where government-led rural electrification 
programmes have been implemented. These countries are Brazil, China, India and South Africa. 
Through benchmarking current achievements with previously set targets, we will infer the main 
challenges faced by implementing bodies and how these have been addressed. The analysis of the 
country chapters 5 bring forth the important issues that need to be considered and addressed for 
the successful implementation of a rural electrification policy. 5 These four country chapters display the electrification efforts of Brazil, China, India and South Africa which 
have achieved more than 65% electrification rate, through huge and running systems, albeit with difficulties. 
These countries have been able to release substantive funds to finance rural electrification, and have relied 
on companies which had sufficient know-how and expertise to achieve the plans. The situation is different 
in sub-Saharan Africa where electrification is closer to 10% (with some exceptions such as Ghana or 
Cameroon). Country reviews on some Sub-Saharan African or South Asian countries would bring greater 
insights into the additional difficulties faced by countries with lower national capacity. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 19 1 Brazil Since the 1988 Constitution, the federal government of Brazil has been assuming full responsibility 
for the distribution of electricity as an essential public service. As a consequence of strong political 
will and the release of sufficient funds, in 2009 Brazil reached an overall electrification rate of 
97.8%. This rate was 99.5% in urban areas and 88 % in rural areas (IEA, 2009b). This has been 
achieved largely through grid extension. Stand-alone systems may be more widely used in the 
future. The country's energy sector, electrification efforts and remaining challenges are described 
below. 1.1 Introduction and country description Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, covering an area of 8.5 million km 2 , equal to about 
half of the South American continent. It is limited to its east and north by the Atlantic Ocean, its 
inland frontiers border with all Southern American countries except for Chile and Ecuador 
(Wikipedia, 2009a). Brazil belongs to the so-called megadiverse countries, a group that 
encompasses about 70% of the planet's biodiversity (WCMC, 1992). Particularly notable are its large 
tropical Amazon and Atlantic coast rainforests as well as the large peatlands (the Pantanal) of the 
midwest. Brazil also extends over semi-arid areas in the north-east (the Sertão) and vast plains in 
the south. It has one of the world's most extensive river systems, including the Amazon and São 
Francisco rivers. Most of the country lies between 200 and 800 metres in elevation. The weather is 
mainly tropical (Wikipedia, 2009a). Economic data 
Over the past years, Brazil has enjoyed a period of stable economic growth with significant social 
and environmental advances. While the country did not escape the global economic downturn in 
2008, Brazil has been able to cope with the crisis by relying on sound macroeconomic policies, as 
well as by expanding its social security net, infrastructure and housing investments (World Bank, 
2009a). Real GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) growth has averaged 4.5% over the 2000-2007 
period (OECD, 2009) before growth prospects dropped to 0.5% in 2009 because of the crisis (World 
Bank, 2009a). GDP/PPP attained USD 1 833 billion in 2007 (OECD, 2009) but is highly concentrated 
in a few regions: the three major economic states of the south-east (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and 
Minas Gerais) account for over half (54.4%) of GDP (IBGE, 2007a). 6 Brazil's main foreign trade 
partners include the European Union, the United States, Mercosur members, as well as China. Population and economic profile 
In 2000 Brazil undertook a census which reported a population close to 170 million inhabitants 
(IBGE, 2002). By 2007 this number had increased to nearly 190 million people, an increase of about 
20 million in only eight years. While the urban population has been constantly rising throughout 
these years (from 142 million in 2001 to 160 million in 2006), the rural population has remained 
relatively constant at 30 million inhabitants (IBGE, 2007b). 7 Estimations of population density show 6 Brazilian reals (BRL) have been converted in USD using the 11 September 2009 exchange rate between the 
two currencies. 1 USD is equal to BRL 1.83035 and 1 BRL to USD 0.54790 (source: http://www.oanda.com). 
7 According to IBGE (2007b) urban includes all municipal and district capitals as well as isolated urban-like 
areas, while rural includes everything outside these perimeters. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 20 much lower indices in rural areas (6.3 inhabitants/km 2 ) 8 than in urban areas (between 33.1 and 
36.8 inhabitants/km 2 ). 9 Of the total economically active population, the largest share works in 
services (59.6%), followed by industry (28.0%) and agriculture (6.7%) (OECD, 2009). There is no officially defined poverty line in Brazil; however, the concept of minimum wage is often 
used in analyses. Accordingly, Silveira and Fernandes (2007) find that the number of indigent people 
decreased from 12.4% in 2001 to about 7.6% in 2005, and the number of poor people from 28.7% 
to 20.8%. 10 Brazil has thus already met the Millennium Development Goal of reducing substantially 
the number of people living in poverty (World Bank, 2009a). Though poverty has been alleviated in 
the past few years, extreme poverty still affects a large population, particularly in the country's 
rural parts of the north-east (Presidency of the Republic, 2007; Silveira et al., 2007). Average rural 
per-capita income is substantially lower than in urban areas: BRL 312 (USD 171) against BRL 689 
(USD 377.5) (IBGE, 2007b). Furthermore, rural regions also display less access to public services, 
such as lack of clean water, sanitation, health services, education, and particularly electricity supply, 
further highlighting the gravity of the rural poverty problem (Rosa et al., 2006). Energy data 
Brazil' energy matrix is based on a comparatively high use of renewable energy, including large-
scale hydropower for electricity generation and biofuels for transport (IEA, 2006; EPE, 2008). In 
2007, the country's overall energy consumption reached 216 million tonnes of oil equivalent 
(Mtoe), with demand driven mainly by petroleum derivates (41.4%, particularly diesel oil and 
gasoline), electricity (16.4%), and sugar cane bagasse (12.4%) (EPE, 2008). Owing to dramatically 
increased production of petroleum, domestic dependence on oil imports has decreased sharply 
over the past years (EPE, 2008; OECD, 2009). Brazil still imports considerable amounts of coal and, 
to a lesser degree, electricity, the latter being obtained in particular from Argentina (EPE, 2008; 
Costa et al., 2008). Electricity generation 
Overall domestic electricity supply increased by 5% between 2006 and 2007, reaching a total of 
483.4 TWh (EPE, 2008). This makes Brazil the largest electricity market in South America (IEA, 
2009c). Large hydroelectricity supplies 72.6% of all electricity, followed by thermoelectricity 
generation (14.7%) (EPE, 2008). Installed electricity generating capacity is around 100 GW (EPE, 
2008). It can be assumed that electricity consumption in rural areas is considerably lower than in 
metropolitan areas. This holds particularly for the household sector where poverty levels are higher 
and overall population is low. Because of the strong reliance on large hydropower dams for electricity generation, most electric 
energy today (98%) is supplied by the large regionally integrated grid transmission system (also 
known as the Sistema Interligado Nacional, SIN) (ESMAP, 2005). Only in the remote areas of the 
Amazon, which cover about 45% of the Brazilian territory but with only 3% of the national 
population, grid electrification has been in part replaced by decentralised electricity supply 
alternatives: mainly small diesel plants supply isolated villages and towns at a total nominal capacity 
of only about 3 GW (Andrade, 2009a). The cost of electricity generation in these areas is high and 
reaches USD 200/MWh (ESMAP, 2005). This is mainly due to the high costs of fuel and 8 Calculations based on Girardi (2008).

10 The poor include those with less than 1/2 a minimum wage per month and the indigent those with less than 
1/4 of a minimum wage per month (Silveira and Fernandes, 2007). For comparison, in September 2007 the 
minimum wage was at BRL 380 (IBGE, 2007a). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 21 transportation (Goldemberg et al., 2004). The service is also weak, often because of the inefficient 
functioning of old motors. Figure 1: Sistema Interligado Nacional (SIN, or National Interconnected System) The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on maps included in this publication do not

Source: ONS (2009). Institutions involved in the power sector 
Brazil's electricity sector today is fully deregulated. Generators (mostly large government-controlled 
companies, but also several private power producers) sell their electricity to distributors via 
auctions. Electricity distribution is mainly operated by the private sector, whereas transmission is 
both publicly and privately owned. The provision of electricity services relies on government 
concessions, and the country is fully covered by either private or state-owned concession areas. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 22 Smaller regions are sometimes covered by authorised rural electrification cooperatives (ESMAP, 
2005). Institutionally, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) oversees the whole power sector 
and is responsible for policy setting. The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL), operating 
under the jurisdiction of the MME, regulates and controls the generation, transmission and 
distribution of power in compliance with current legislation. Eletrobrás is a federally-owned holding 
company for electricity assets, controlling a large part of electric power generation and transmission 
systems mainly through six subsidiary companies, as well as some distribution capacity in the 
Amazon area. The Empresa de Pesquisa Energética (EPE, or Energy Research Company) is 
responsible for the development of integrated long-term planning of Brazil's power sector, thus 
supporting MME's national energy policy and long-term planning. Urban-rural electricity access 
Access to electricity in rural areas has widened strongly throughout the past years. By 2007, 
55.35 million out of a total 56.34 million permanent residences were connected to electric energy. 
In 2009, the overall Brazilian electrification rate reached 97.8%. The rate is 99.5% in urban areas 
and 88 % in rural areas, putting Brazil among the group of Latin American countries with near-
universal electricity access (IEA, 2009b). The Ministry of Mines and Energy expects that electricity 
will be available in every single Brazilian household by 2010. A few years ago, only 73% of the rural 
population had access to electricity and 12 million people in 2.5 million households were still 
without electricity (ESMAP, 2005). 1.2 Institutional structures for rural electrification The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 recognises the distribution of electricity as an essential public 
service, for which the federal government is to assume full responsibility, either directly or through 
designated concessions or permits (Goldemberg et al., 2004). 11 Up to the 1990s, rural electrification 
policies were often implemented at the state level, using state treasury resources, and having the 
programmes implemented by concessionaires controlled by state governments (ESMAP, 2005; 
Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). Besides these activities, a number of international donors as well as 
non-governmental organisations supported or implemented several non-sectoral and decentralised 
electrification projects in Brazil, with institutional set-ups and responsibilities varying considerably 
between the different programmes (see Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005; Zerriffi, 2007). 1.2.1 Major electrification programmes Two large federal-led rural electrification programmes – PRODEEM (Programa de Desenvolvimento 
Energético de Estados e de Municípios, or Energy Development Programme of States and 
Municipalities) and Luz no Campo (LnC, Light in the Countryside) – were established in 1994 and 
2000 respectively, however without a clear target for reaching universal access in rural areas. 
Because no specialised federal rural electrification agency existed, PRODEEM and LnC were co-
ordinated by different actors: LnC by Eletrobrás under coordination of the MME, and PRODEEM 
directly by the MME. Both programmes also drew funding from different sources, the National 
Treasury Funds in the case of PRODEEM, and Reserva Global de Reversão (Global Reversion 
Reserve, or RGR) loans for utilities in the case of LnC (Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005). The 11 Service providers are mainly concessionaires and permissionaires (permit-holders) authorised by ANEEL. 
Generally speaking, permit-holders are independent operators that work inside a concession area. Rural 
electrification co-operatives can become permit-holders if they provide a public service (ESMAP, 2005). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 23 RGR was implemented as early as 1971 and has been managed by Eletrobrás. About one-fourth of 
the available RGR resources are set aside by law for low-income consumers in rural areas (ESMAP, 
2005). There were no other significant federal rural electrification funds. In 2003 the current rural electrification programme, Luz para Todos (Light for All, or LpT), which is 
to give universal access in the country's rural areas by 2010, was formalised and implemented. The 
programme is based on the obligation for service providers to universalise rural electricity access 
(as set by the Brazilian Constitution), on substantial federal and state resources for the service 
providers, and on low tariffs for low-income and rural consumers (Zerriffi, 2007; Poppe, 2009). 1.2.2 Institutional structure – implementation and funding On 11 November 2003, LpT was inaugurated. LpT's original aim was universal access to electricity in 
all rural areas of Brazil by 2008, keeping in mind the five-year deadline defended by ANEEL. In total 
numbers, Lpt was to provide two million rural connections (MME, 2003; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009) 
for free to yet unattended consumers, where each household would also receive an  " internal kit "  
containing several power plugs, lamps, and other necessary material (Eletrobrás and MME, 2009). 
Because of the surge of new demands for rural electrification not identified when the programme 
started and for other reasons, the original LpT deadline was postponed to 2010 (Eletrobrás and 
MME, 2009). With LpT, a new institutional structure for rural electrification emerged, in which the Regulatory Agency 
ANEEL (established during the electricity sector restructuring process during the 1990s) and Eletrobrás 
play pivotal roles. ANEEL is responsible for the authorisation of concessionaires and other service 
providers (which generally occurs through bidding processes among interested actors) (ESMAP, 2005). 
ANEEL also sets and verifies the annual electrification targets for LpT. Eletrobrás, on the other hand, 
holds the operational secretariat of the programme. This includes carrying out the technical and 
financial analyses of the connections to be installed by the service providers, the allocation of funds to 
these actors, and the supervision of the installations. As with LnC, the MME co-ordinates the 
development of the LpT programme and sets its general policies. Several decision and advisory councils 
at federal and state levels support the institutional structure for rural electrification, dealing with various 
issues such as the promotion of productive uses of energy in newly connected municipalities or the 
setting-up of priority lists for rural electrification operations. These councils generally involve a great 
variety of stakeholders which, depending on the level of the council (federal or state), may include 
representatives from the MME, other ministries, Eletrobrás, ANEEL, local municipalities, unions, and the 
service providers (Eletrobrás, 2008; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009). 12 State governments support the federal government's LpT universalisation strategy by providing part 
of the funds – in the form of grants to the service providers – to finance operations. These 
contributions are on average in the order of 10% of total LpT investments (Instituto Acende Brasil, 
2007a). The main funding sources, however, still come from the federal government: through RGR 
grants and loans (at low interest rates) and grants from the newly implemented Conta de 
Desenvolvimento Energético (Energy Development Account, or CDE) (Strazzi et al., 2008). RGR is 
funded by annual levies on investments by concessionaires, while the CDE was implemented in 
2002 specifically for creating a new instrument to finance the universalisation of rural electricity 
access in Brazil. 13 CDE resources come from a variety of sources, including payments for the use of 12 See Eletrobrás and MME, 2009, p. 28 for a schematic overview on the current institutional structure. 
13 It should be noted that while CDE was specifically designed to help reach universal rural electricity access in 
Brazil, no new financial burdens were created due to its implementation as CDE basically substituted an Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 24 public assets, fines by ANEEL to concessionaires and permit-holders, and annual quotas paid by 
electricity sellers (ESMAP, 2005). 14 The concessionaires' participation in financing the operations is 
defined together with the MME and Eletrobrás, and varies on average between 10% and 15% 
(Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). As connection costs within LpT are totally free for rural consumers, 
in general any long-run costs occurring to the service providers (operation and management, 
capital, and replacement costs) following electrification are to be covered by the service providers 
themselves through electricity tariffs (ESMAP, 2005; Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). These tariffs 
are subsidised for small consumption levels. More than a third of residential customers (35%) in 
Brazil belong to the low consumer tariff sub-class. A total of 77% of the low-income consumers use 
up to 80 kWh of electricity per month and 23% between 80 and 220 kWh. Low-income consumers 
represent 43% of total consumers in the north, 62% in the north-east, 25% both in the south-east 
and the south, and 29% in the midwest (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007b). Tariff increases due to LpT had been limited to 8% in 2005, so that concessionaires and other 
service providers have limited possibilities to recover their operation and management costs in the 
long run (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). 1.3 Description of current electrification programmes and 
objectives Interestingly enough the creation of a programme aiming to provide universal access to electricity in 
Brazil gained force exactly at a time when two federal-led rural electrification programmes (LnC and 
PRODEEM) were still in their implementation phase. 15 Most centralised concessionaires did not have 
clear univeralisation targets, and particularly privately run concessionaires (with tight budget 
constraints) had little interest in promoting rural electrification because of the high costs of supplying 
electricity services to low-consuming, remote and dispersed households, which would make cost 
recovery of the investments extremely difficult (Goldemberg et al., 2004; Obermaier, 2005). As they were unable to reach substantial progress regarding rural electrification, as early as 2000 the 
authorities formed the idea of a universal electricity access programme that would supply electricity to 
all rural properties in Brazil within a five-year period (Cortez and Rosillo-Calle, 2001; Poppe, 2002). 
Particularly taken forward by ANEEL, the following discussions, involving a large variety of stakeholders 
(including representatives from other ministries, MME, Eletrobrás, ANEEL, development banks, 
associations of concessionaires, rural electrification co-operatives, renewable energy trade associations, earlier power sector fund. In fact, financial contributions for the CDE remained at the same level compared 
with its predecessor (Poppe, 2009). 
14 Other important resources come from the fuel compensation account (CCC, or Conta de Consumo de 
Combustíveis), which is a levy on all Brazilian electricity consumers. Today it primarily finances thermal 
generation via diesel in the Amazon region (ESMAP, 2005). 
15 Both programmes were criticised throughout their implementation: LnC financed grid electrification for 
some 600 thousand households living near a grid all over Brazil over a period of three years, falling short of 
the initial one million households target as well as in providing inexpensive electrification (Goldemberg et al., 
2004; ESMAP, 2005). The PRODEEM programme provided mainly non-grid solar PV electrification to 
community installations, health facilities and schools. Top-down management with little local stakeholder 
involvement, lack of cost-recovery schemes, and lack of co-ordination with grid electrification plans severely 
affected the results of PRODEEM (Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005; Costa et al., 2008). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 25 universities and research centres, and non-governmental organisations), eventually led to the 
formalisation and implementation of the federal Luz para Todos programme (ESMAP, 2005). 16 1.3.1 Luz para Todos targets and achievements LpT prioritises investments that focus on productive uses of electricity and integrated local 
development projects − community production centres, water wells, health clinics and schools − 
but also seeks to service municipalities that had been left aside by the previous electrification 
efforts, such as indigenous areas, settlements, as well as areas with lower-than-average human 
development indices (HDI), regions where inhabitants are affected by hydropower dams, etc. (see 
Eletrobrás and MME, 2009, for the complete priority list). The target groups for rural electrification 
thus live mainly in the northern and north-eastern states of the country where electricity access at 
the beginning of LpT was lowest in both nominal and relative numbers: in the north-east 1.1 million 
rural households (34.4% of all rural households in the region), and in the north 447 thousand rural 
households (59.7% of all rural households in that region) lacked access to electric energy. 
Altogether, both regions thus accounted for more than 75% of the originally planned installations 
within LpT (Obermaier, 2005; ESMAP, 2005); both rural regions are also those with higher poverty 
rates and less access to other basic services (Rosa et al., 2006). Table 1: LpT rural electricity connection timetable (number of households) 2004

it started, the LpT programme had considerable difficulties in keeping up with the tight schedule set 
by ANEEL: already by 2005 the deficit of electricity connections had reached nearly 270 thousand 
households. Inexperience with LpT, political and administrative interferences, as well as supply 
shortages of material and services including cables, posts, etc. caused by the explosion of demand 
may explain part of these delays (Andrade, 2009b). In 2006, however, LpT's actual installations 
surpassed planned installations, and thus led to a declining deficit. In 2008, LpT was about 
65 thousand installations short of the original targets. Finally, the pace of electrification is estimated 
to increase substantially until 2010, with 510 thousand new installations planned for 2009 and 
578 thousand more for 2010, which is far above what had been realised the years before. These 
planned connections correspond mainly to the newly identified rural electrification demand – the 
original LpT target of two million installations had nearly been met in 2008 with 1.88 million 
connections. 16 Initially ANEEL published a resolution by which universal access was to be attained by 2015. With the 
implementation of LpT, however, this target was brought forward by seven years (2008 instead of the original 
end date of 2015). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 26 At the beginning of LpT, Dilma Rousseff, Minister of the MME, defined LpT as  " a proposal to reduce 
poverty and hunger, using electricity as a vector for development "  (MME, 2003, author's own 
translation). This statement underlines that rural electrification is prioritised as a key objective of 
Brazil's overall poverty alleviation strategy (ESMAP, 2005), particularly regarding social inclusion of 
the rural poor (Goldemberg et al., 2004). While prior rural electrification initiatives had 
concentrated mostly on increasing access to infrastructure, it was decreed that a universal access 
strategy should also encompass electricity consumption so as to enable the beneficiaries to use 
electricity as an instrument for economic and social development (Obermaier, 2005). Electricity use 
for the rural poor is promoted essentially through lower tariffs for low-consumption classes, the 
idea being that low consumption is correlated with low income (Zerriffi, 2007). 17 1.3.2 Means of electrification under the LpT In the operational manual of LpT, three technological options are listed to provide electricity to 
rural households: i) extension of grid distribution lines, ii) decentralised generation in isolated grids, 
and iii) individual systems. Despite these different possibilities for service providers, the Brazilian 
electrification model is primarily based on extension of the grid (Reiche et al., 2006; Zerriffi, 2007; 
Andrade, 2009b). At least during the first years of LpT, grid extensions have often been the least-
cost option for the utility (Zerriffi, 2007). Thus until 2009, 4.62 million posts, 883 thousand km of 
cable, and 708 thousand transformers have been installed within the universalisation strategy 
(MME, 2009b). Large reliance on grid extension to attain universal rural access may not be economical in the future 
as LpT is now expected to reach out to the marginally more remote and dispersed consumers away 
from the existing distribution lines (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a; Andrade, 2009b). 18 Nevertheless, 
according to MME, the remaining one million connections planned for 2009 and 2010 (see Table 1) 
will still be realised largely through extensions of the grid. It should be noted that already under the 
LnC phase, lack of incentives to provide low-cost connections and non-grid electrification had been 
perceived (Goldemberg et al., 2004). Connection costs may reach USD 4 000 and more if population 
density is low and consumers are dispersed. These costs are well above any international 
benchmark, and electrification options other than grid extensions may provide much cheaper 
alternatives in such cases (ESMAP, 2005; Reiche et al., 2006). Renewable energy has been used very little in the beginning of LpT (Pertusier, 2004). Even by end of 
2006, only around 3 100 solar home systems (SHS) had been installed under LpT, although it had 
been estimated that for 17 500 localities – translating into some 130 000 systems – such systems 
would be the most cost-effective option (IEA, 2009d). Decentralised renewable electrification 
options, by either individual systems or mini-grids, could play a more relevant role during the 2009-
2010 period, particularly in the remote and isolated villages of the Amazon region. There are still 
many rural isolated communities in the Amazon that cannot be assisted by the conventional 17 This is not always the case: a study on the impacts of rural electrification in the State of Bahia in the north-
east of Brazil finds that electricity consumption and income are not strongly correlated, neither on a per-
capita nor at household level, although families had received electricity three years earlier (Obermaier, 2009). 
18 The options used to connect rural consumers are found in the contracts established between Eletrobràs 
and the concessionaires or other service providers. Thus, information on the costs and technological choices 
are not publicly available. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 27 system. 19 However, the use of expensive diesel generators in this region is still the norm (Andrade, 
2009b). It is estimated that in the Amazon region 80% of the unattended communities have less 
than 30 households (Amazonas Energia, 2009), and very few settlements have more than 
100 inhabitants. Because of the distance from the main transmission and distribution lines, grid 
extension for these communities is economically unviable. With the publication of the 
February 2009 Manual de Projetos Especiais of the MME (a special projects manual that establishes 
technical and financial criteria to be applied for electricity services through renewable energies), the 
choice between which renewable energy technology to use, such as solar PV systems, wind and 
hybrid power plants, thermal power plants powered by natural gas or biofuels, mini and micro-
hydro systems, and vegetable palm oil as a replacement for diesel imports will be done according to 
local conditions (MME, 2009d). However, at the moment only 23 special projects are being analysed 
by Eletrobrás, and there is a strong concern that diesel generators will continue to be used to attain 
universalisation targets if current projects fail to go beyond their pilot testing phase. 1.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs For the ambitious targets of LpT a significant budget was set up during its implementation phase. As the 
LpT programme was a partnership between the federal government, the states and the concessionaires, 
funding resources were to be divided among the various actors, with the federal government taking up the 
largest share (71.5% of investments are covered by the federal government's power sector funds, 13% by 
the states and 15.5% by the concessionaires). The federal government's power sector funds direct more 
resources on loans to states with lower electrification rates and in greater need of investment, and fewer 
to regions whose rates are much higher. Initially LpT total costs were estimated at BRL 7.6 billion 
(USD 4.16 billion), with Energy Deelopment Accounts (CDE) and Global Reversion Reserve (RGR) funds 
contributing BRL 5.3 (USD 2.9 billion) or around 75% to the overall budget, and the remainder being split in 
equal shares between the states and the service providers (MME, 2003). According to the calculations 
made at the time, investments were to be particularly high in the northern and north-eastern states of the 
country: with BRL 1.73 billion (USD 0.94 billion) and BRL 2.64 billion (USD 1.44 billion) respectively, these 
states would account for over two-thirds of the total planned investments (Loureiro de Azeredo, 2004). 
When implementation of LpT began, however, overall costs soon increased significantly. By 2007, total 
contracted rural electrification operations had already reached BRL 8.69 billion (USD 4.76 billion) (Instituto 
Acende Brasil, 2007a), implying that the originally planned budget had already been overstepped even 
though rural connections were still significantly behind schedule at that time (about a 125 thousand 
connections short, see Table 1). Current MME estimates (MME, 2009c) show that the LpT budget has 
further increased: the federal share is now at BRL 9.1 billion (USD 5 billion), with total investment costs 
estimated at BRL 12.7 billion (USD 7 billion). Therefore, in only six years, estimated LpT costs have 
increased by 67% over the original BRL 7.6 billion (USD 4.16 billion) initially projected. Increased demand for connections in rural areas (one million connections more than initially identified) 
may be responsible for a large share of the cost increases, but it is also likely that electrification costs 
were simply underestimated from the start. The technical standards for rural electricity connections did 19 The long distances to these communities are only a part of the problem. Logistics are strongly affected by 
the tropical climate, which leaves settlements and towns completely isolated from November to April during 
the rainy season when rivers overflow and landscapes change completely (Andrade, 2009b). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 28 indeed change since LpT implementation in 2003 (compare Eletrobrás and MME, 2005 and 2009), but it 
is unclear whether these changes had any significant impact on the overall programme costs. 20 1.4.1 Framework conditions and business incentives Eletrobrás, through the Eletrobrás' Control system, is in charge of contract management and 
supervision, from the establishment of the contracts to the transfer of funds. Eletrobrás uses its 
own monitoring methodology, carrying out sample inspections on site. At the state level, a State 
Managing Committee reviews and prioritises the needs of the communities, and monitors the 
implementation of prioritised works. To facilitate smooth implementation of the LpT, minimise misusage of funds, reduce the risk of disruption 
of the work, and advance the disbursement by the concessionaires, financial transfers 21 in the case of grid 
extension are conducted as described in Table 2. Table 2: Timeline of funds release for grid extension works Quota

supply technologies), as well as difficulties to electrify remote and isolated villages in the Amazon may have driven 
costs upwards. No data are publicly available which could prove this assumption. To verify this, one would have to 
analyse the contracts between Eletrobrás and the concessionaires. They are not publicly available.

(MME, 2009d) receive 85% of the electrification costs in the form of grants from the CDE, with the 
remaining 15% to be financed by the service providers. Total funds are released according to the 
timeline presented in Table 3. 1.4.2 Customer tariffs Beneficiaries of LpT usually pay discounted consumer tariffs owing to their low consumption level. 
These so-called  " social tariffs "  are not linked to LpT, but available also to urban consumers. Those 
who use up to 30 kWh per month pay only 35% of the regular residential tariff, while those 
consuming between 31 kWh and 80 kWh per month pay the reduced tariff of 60% of the regular 
residential tariff. Under certain circumstances a 10% discount can be obtained even by consumers 
who use less than 140 kWh/month to 220 kWh/month (with the upper limit varying regionally), but 
who must also prove that they have a low income. In the states of the north and the north-east 43% 
and 62% of all consumers fall within the social tariff classes, which are the highest rates for all Brazil 
(Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007b). It should be noted that these regions also display the highest 
poverty indices and lowest access rates to a variety of public services. Although low income does 
not always correlate with low consumption levels, recently connected households that live below or 
near the poverty line rarely consume high amounts of electricity but rather around 30 to 40 kWh 
per month (Obermaier, 2005 and 2009). In 2007, the average electricity tariff in Brazil was BRL 252.91/MWh (USD 138.5/MWh), with 
residential consumers paying BRL 293.59/MWh (USD 160.8/MWh) and industrial consumers paying 
BRL 216.61/MWh (USD 118.7/MWh). 1.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed Management of the networks 
The LpT programme was created from an already consolidated electricity sector structure, with 
concessionaires having to abide by their system operation and maintenance obligations and to Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 30 follow the regulations in force. A concessionaire is therefore responsible for the management of the 
installed networks, unless it has transferred its obligations to a permit-holder, for example. In the 
case of isolated and remote communities in the Amazon (where costs are extremely high) 
independent producers (that is without a concession) may become the main actors in supplying and 
maintaining rural electricity services. The Special Projects Manual of the MME (MME, 2009d) sets 
the technical, financial and management criteria for the use of renewable energy technologies in 
electrification of isolated communities. Means for future capacity expansion 
The focus on household electrification under the LpT programme seems to have led sometimes to 
an undersizing of capacity, including isolated diesel generators in the Amazon region and solar PV 
systems (Zerriffi, 2007). However, no further commitments have been made by the Brazilian 
government regarding future capacity expansion once universal electricity access has been reached. 
Given the unfavourable economics of rural electrification, it can thus be expected that no further 
efforts will be made in the near future to increase loads. If consumers desire better-quality supply, 
they would have to contact their service providers directly. Revenue collection 
One of the challenges of the LpT programme is to bring electricity to remote and isolated areas, 
such as in the north, where the programme has not achieved its goal. The current concern is that 
concessionaires may have difficulties in collecting bills in systems that use renewable energies. For 
this reason, the 2009 Special Projects Manual (MME, 2009d) encourages projects that include a 
prepaid solution, whereby consumers pay in advance for the electricity they expect to use, and 
within their financial capacity. Moreover, remote monitoring computer systems are being 
connected to central systems for better supervision. Involvement of the rural communities in the decision-making process 
Under the LpT, rural dwellers themselves request the installation of electricity directly to the 
concessionaires. These requests are then analysed and prioritised by State Management 
Committees (CGE) according to the characteristics of the locality. To date, 26 Brazilian states have 
State Management Committees, which are composed of members of the federal government, the 
state government, the concessionaires and rural electrification co-operatives, regulatory agencies, 
mayors and the civil society. These committees meet regularly to assess requests and prioritise 
work. The involvement of the civil society is fundamental in the electrification process, as it 
improves the planning and implementation process and gives communities a sense of ownership of 
the electrification process. Progress monitoring 
As mentioned before, Eletrobrás uses its own monitoring methodology through on-site inspections. 
At the state level, a State Managing Committee reviews and prioritises the needs of the targeted 
communities, and monitors the implementation of the works. This monitoring is linked to the 
release of funds for further works, and allows to follow-up the work of the concessionaires. Implementation of other policies in parallel to the LpT 
The Commissão Nacional de Universalização (National Universalisation Commission, CNU), which is 
part of the LpT institutional structure and formed by Brazilian federal ministries, including the MME, 
the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and the Regulatory Agency ANEEL, establishes policies and 
directives for electricity use to promote integrated rural development. The MME has also 
established united action protocols with other ministries so as to facilitate the improvement or 
even the creation of basic health and education services, water supply, and communication in the 
communities, along with rural electrification. The Brazilian Bolsa Família income transfer Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 31 programme and other recent activities such as a social housing project or the national biodiesel 
programme are examples of policies designed for the same groups targeted by LpT, namely the 
rural poor. Together, these activities may lead to a more sustainable rural economic development. More direct actions under LpT include the construction of so-called Centros Comunitários de 
Produção (CCP), community centres which are to promote a rational and efficient use of electricity 
for productive purposes. Initially CCPs were to be installed throughout Brazil (MME, 2003) but the 
total number is expected to be relatively low. For example, Eletrobrás has so far managed to 
establish only three CCPs, none of which is located in remote and poor municipalities. The MME is 
currently in the process of contracting specialists which are to work directly with CCPs, so that more 
efforts in this regard can be expected. In 2008, the federal government launched the Programa Territórios da Cidadania (Territories of 
Citizenship Programme). This programme is a joint ministerial effort to promote economic growth 
through territorial development to improve the quality of life of the people living in rural or poor 
regions. The MME has joined other ministries in this effort currently implemented in 120 selected 
territories and to be ended in 2010. The LpT programme makes hardly any room for energy efficiency policies. There is only one 
example in the current version of the LpT operational manual, which states that the complete kit to 
be installed with the electricity connection will contain fluorescent lamps which are more efficient 
(Eletrobrás and MME, 2009). Otherwise, no comprehensive approach seems to have been taken to 
ensure efficient energy use by the new consumers. Other country-specific challenges and how they were addressed 
Several country-specific challenges regarding LpT rural electrification were identified: i) reaching 
universal access by concessionaires that in some cases are in great financial difficulties, ii) finding 
technological and organisational solutions for the Amazon region, and iii) ensuring long-term 
sustainability of the programme once funds have run out. Most of these challenges had been 
identified even before LpT was implemented. Given that they have not been addressed properly, 
most problems remain (Poppe, 2009). The concessionaires have access to the Energy Development Accounts (CDE) and Global Reversion 
Reserve (RGR) funds as well as to state subsidies in order to finance installations for rural 
consumers to receive free electricity access under LpT. According to the overall funding schemes, 
fewer subsidies are granted to states with higher electrification rates and where electrification can 
be achieved at lower cost, whereas states with low rural access and higher costs receive larger 
federal subsidies. Such flexibility allows for relatively uniform tariffs throughout the country, so that 
customers in remote places do not have to pay disproportionately high bills because they are 
difficult to reach by the concessionaires or other service providers. Combined with this, in some cases, a concessionaire may have many consumers with low 
consumption levels to whom the so-called social tariffs apply. These discounted tariffs make cost 
recovery extremely difficult even with LpT subsidies, particularly for utilities that in addition have 
low rates of rural electricity access (ESMAP, 2005). In these cases, privately owned concessionaires 
often charge their wealthier, urban consumers higher tariffs in order to cross-subsidise rural 
consumers. Public concessionaires with softer budget constraints are usually allowed to show 
losses, thus reducing the need to cross-subsidise (Zerriffi, 2007). However, as the current rural 
electrification strategy could well lead to rapidly rising electricity tariffs, the tariff impact of LpT was 
limited to 8%, which in turn strongly affected the concessionaires' ability to proceed with rural 
electrification. In case the tariff impact would rise above 8%, original universalisation schedules 
would have to be postponed until the conditions within the concession area had improved, insofar Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 32 as continued electrification could be undertaken without going beyond the 8% limit. In fact, since 
2005 there have been twelve cases of concessionaires that had to interrupt their rural 
electrification programmes before reaching universal access because of this restriction (Instituto 
Acende Brasil, 2007a). Furthermore, ensuring cost recovery under LpT poses problems. Service providers are likely to still 
require subsidies even after LpT reaches its universalisation target. This is because costs for 
operation and management, capital and replacement have to be incorporated into the calculations 
by the service providers (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). Where low consumption levels remain, 
concessionaires are expected to face serious problems, especially if they are already in financial 
difficulties. Finally, it should be noted that the current model also creates problems in case of a 
greater use of distributed generation technologies. For example, independent producers 
implementing mini-grids are unlikely to use cross-subsidisation mechanisms when the consumer 
base is small, thus making it impossible for the producer to charge the social tariffs (Zerriffi, 2007). Finally, the rural isolated communities, located for the most part in the Amazon region, will be 
serviced through the guidelines of the Special Manual Projects. But since these guidelines have 
been released at a very late stage (in 2009), only a few projects have yet been undertaken. 1.6 Rural electrification progress, assessment and conclusion The Brazilian LpT rural electrification programme is now well known internationally because of its 
ambitious targets and its success in carrying out the necessary investments and installations. In 
Brazil, LpT was since its beginning considered as one of the few programmes with the potential to 
significantly improve living conditions in rural Brazil (Loureiro de Azeredo, 2004). While operations 
have been lagging behind the originally agreed universalisation plans, the current pace of LpT 
installations is such that the 2010 deadline is within reach. In June 2009, the number of connections 
had surpassed two million so that over ten million people have now benefited directly from LpT. 
The original target (two million rural connections) established in 2003 has been met. However, 
reaching universal access in the poorer and sparsely populated northern and north-eastern states 
has proven to be a more difficult task (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007; Poppe, 2009). It is estimated 
that up to 2010 another million connections will be brought to the rural areas of Brazil, benefiting 
to some five more million people (Presidency of the Republic, 2009). Considerable difficulties can be 
expected for this last million connections, as grid electrification may no longer be a feasible option 
for many communities, particularly in the Amazon region. According to the MME, grid extension will 
continue to play a substantial role in connecting the remaining one million households within LpT. Table 4 summarises the actual results of LpT including the latest data available for 2009.

Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 33 The postponement of the original 2008 deadline can be explained by several factors: the number of 
rural households to benefit from electricity access was greatly underestimated; occasionally 
administrative inexperience or interferences by various stakeholder levels; delays by service 
providers because of their obligation to limit the tariff impact of LpT to 8%; higher costs and 
sometimes depleted stocks for electrification material and services. Nevertheless, it should be 
acknowledged that even with the postponement of the deadlines, LpT schedules are still 
impressive, and missing the 2008 target should not have come as a total surprise. While there is little doubt that LpT will succeed in providing universal access to electricity, it is 
important to note that several obstacles need to be overcome not only regarding the current focus 
on electricity access, but also regarding questions about the financial and economic long-term 
sustainability of the programme. The twin policies of universal access (high costs) and low tariffs 
(low revenues) for concessionaires lead to a very difficult situation even when accounting for the 
subsidies the utilities receive (Zerriffi, 2007) as operation and management, capital and 
replacement costs need to be covered by the service providers in the long run. 22 The dominance of 
grid electrification − even when little productive use can be expected in the near future − is causing 
this problem, further compromising the financial balance of the utilities. Promoting productive uses 
of electricity in order to raise utilities' revenues is thus vital to guarantee the long-term success of 
the electrification installations once LpT comes to an end (Zerriffi, 2007). Despite the efforts to promote such uses, the impacts of LpT so far seem to be much more on the 
consumption side than on the production side. An ex post study on the benefits of LpT found that, 
thanks to the programme, households find their living conditions significantly improved. 
Furthermore, purchases of household appliances such as TVs, refrigerators and sound systems have 
increased. Other positive impacts of LpT are better conditions to study, for longer hours during the 
day and the evening, as well as increased work opportunities (MME, 2009). It is unclear whether 
these perceived benefits will eventually result in, for example, higher family incomes. 22 This is the case for service providers that cannot show losses, particularly privately owned concessionaires. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 35 2 China China, with strong political will, extended its electricity grids and exploited the country's 
hydropower and solar potential. China achieved an electrification rate of 99.4% in 2009, with rural 
areas reaching 99% and urban areas 100% (IEA, 2009b). Over the last ten years, rural electrification 
has slowed down because of nearly complete nationwide electrification. The emphasis is put on 
modernisation, service and quality improvements, poverty alleviation and introduction of 
innovative technology solutions for the remaining non-electrified remote areas in the vast western 
regions of the country. China will now focus mainly on the use of decentralised power systems to 
supply, by the end of 2020, most of the people who are still without electricity. 2.1 Introduction and country description China, with a land area of 9.6 million square kilometres, is the world's third-largest country by 
geographical extent. China, with 22 147 km of land boundaries, shares its borders with a total of 
14 countries, namely, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, 
Mongolia, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam. China is characterised by 
three climatic zones: tropical, subtropical and temperate. Economic data and investment 
In 2008, China's economy grew by 9%, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of USD 4 400 billion 
(bn). The primary sector amounted to USD 501.6 bn (11.3% of GDP), the secondary sector to 
USD 2 138.4 bn (48.6% of GDP) and the tertiary sector to USD 1 764.4 bn (40.1% of GDP) (National 
Bureau of Statistics China, 2009). If measured in purchasing power parity (PPP), China's GDP grew to 
USD 7 903 bn in 2008, ranking second after the United States (World Bank, 2009b). In China, foreign investment is generally driven by directives from the central government that sets 
detailed rules for numerous parameters such as technology, location and investment size. China 
proactively guides and encourages foreign investments in new and renewable energies, while 
restricting investment in conventional coal-fired power plants. At present, procedures for approval 
of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects are in accordance with the  " Regulation on Guiding the 
Direction of Foreign Investment "  (February 2002, Decree of the State Council) and with the 
 " Decision of the State Council on the Reform of Investment System " , July 2004). With respect to investment in energy structures, under  " The Directory of Industry for Foreign 
Investment "  (revised in 2007), foreign investment is encouraged in  " the construction and operation 
of hydropower stations, giving priority to electricity " , and  " the construction and operation of new 
energy power stations (including solar energy, wind energy, magnetic energy, geothermal energy, 
tidal and wave energy, biomass energy, etc.) " . Foreign investment is prohibited in  " the construction 
and operation of coal-fired steam-condensing power plants with the stand-alone capacity of 
300 000 kilowatts (kW) and below, the coal-fired dual units of steam-condensing and extracting, 
heat and power co-generation plants with the stand-alone capacity of 100 000 kW and below, 
outside the range of Tibet, Xinjiang, Hainan minor power grids " . Population and its economic profile 
With a total population of 1 325 bn people in 2008 (World Bank, 2009c), China ranks first in the 
world. Almost half of the population (45%) live in cities while 55 % live in rural areas. In the past, Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 36 subject to a strict local residence permit system, domestic migration from rural to urban areas was 
nearly impossible. In recent years, rural to urban migration has been more prominent. In this 
context, latest estimates suggest that China's urbanisation rate will increase by nearly 1% per year 
during the next 15 to 20 years, which represents around 300 million people who will move from 
rural areas into cities (China Daily, 2009). Today, China's average population density is 
approximately 138 per km 2 (Wikipedia, 2009b), but with extreme variations in rural population 
densities, ranging from less than one to more than 400 per km 2 . In stark contrast, the highest urban 
population density per km 2 is 50 000 to 60 000 as in the case of central Beijing, Shanghai and 
Chongqing (China Daily, 2009). Of the total working population, 40.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.8 % in industry and 32.4% in 
services (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2008). With China's rapid economic development, 
the income of Chinese residents has risen steadily. In 2008, the gross national income per capita per 
atlas method amounted to USD 2 770 (global country ranking 130 out of 210 countries) and 
accordingly purchasing power parity amounted to USD 6 020 (global country ranking 122 out of 
210 countries) (World Bank, 2009d). At the end of 2008, China's national employment amounted to 774.80 million people, of which 
39.01% lived in urban areas. A total of 40.07 million people in rural areas lived below the poverty 
level, 23 defined as CNY 1 196 24 (approximately USD 75) per capita per annum (National Bureau of 
Statistics of China, 2009). Electricity generation and consumption 
In 2008, total electricity production amounted to 3.45 trillion kWh, an increase of 5.6% compared to 
2007. Thermal power accounted for 81.2% of total production, with hydropower accounting for 
16.5% and nuclear energy for 2%. Forecasts for 2009 suggest that total power consumption will 
increase by 3.5%, to 3.56 trillion kWh. According to estimates by the Power Economic Research 
Institute of the State Grid Corporation, national consumption of electricity is expected to reach 
approximately 3.94 trillion kWh by 2015 and approximately 7.425 trillion kWh by 2020 (State Grid 
Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). Figure 2: China's national power generation structure (in %) in 2008 Source: State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping (2009). In 2007, total electricity consumption amounted to 3.27 TWh, comprising of 58.8% urban 
consumption and 41.2% rural consumption (NBS and NDRC, 2008). 23 There is no information regarding urban poverty. 
24 Chinese yuan (CNY) have been converted in USD using the 6 October 2009 exchange rate between the two 
currencies. 1 USD is equal to CNY 6.83640 and 1 CNY into USD 0.14671 (source: http://www.oanda.com). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 37 Installed capacity and energy consumption 
By the end of 2008, China's total installed power generation capacity amounted to 793 GW, an 
increase of 10.4% since 2007. In 2009, an additional 80 GW is expected to be installed, and by 2020 
total capacity should more than double, reaching 1 600 GW with thermal power accounting for 65% 
(State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). Owing to its coal-
dominated energy supply structure, thermal power generation capacity accounts for more than 
75% of total installed capacity and China ranks first worldwide in hard coal 25 production, producing 
47.4 % of the world's total hard coal in 2008 (IEA, 2009c). Figure 3: China's power generation capacity (in %) in 2008 Source: State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping (2009). China's 2008 total energy consumption amounted to 1 995 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) 
with coal accounting for 70%. In 2008, total consumption amounted to 2.74 bn tonnes (a 3% 
increase compared to 2007) of which approximately 40 Mt of coal had been imported. In the first 
half of 2009, approximately 48.2 Mt were imported, an increase of 126.3 % (State Grid Corp. Power 
Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). Total consumption of oil in 2008, mainly used in 
the transport sector, amounted to 360 Mt with domestic production accounting for roughly half. 
China, after the United States and Japan, is the third-largest oil importer in the world. Recent 
estimates by the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of China suggest that by 2020, the oil consumption 
may reach 620 Mt, of which approximately 60% will have to be imported. Although its share in total 
energy consumption has increased over the years, natural gas only represented 3.63% of total 
energy consumption in 2008. The government is seeking to increase that share to 10% by 2020 
(State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). During the 11 th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) the Chinese government plans to reduce energy use per 
unit of GDP by 20%. In this context, a reduction of 1.79% was achieved in 2006, 4.04% in 2007 and 
4.59 % in 2008 leading to a cumulative reduction of 10.4% (Energy Research Institute Han, Wenke 
2009). Additional efforts will be needed to reach the 20% target. 25 Including recovered coal.

Institutions involved in the power sector 
Over the past 50 years, China's power management system has been in the process of continual 
adjustment and changes. Before 1985, China centralised planning and management of the power 
industry system, whereby the only decision-making body was the central government which was 
directly responsible for production and allocation of resources. The system was managed through a 
combination of central government and enterprises, and all investment and operation funds were 
allocated by the State, while all the revenues were allocated to the Treasury. In 1985, the State 
Council approved the  " Provisional Regulation on Encouragement of Fund-raising for Power Plants 
and Implementation of Varied Prices " , with the introduction of a new principle whereby the 
enterprise now runs the power plant and the State manages the grid. Provinces were then also 
allowed to manage power. The central government therefore gradually relaxed the regulation and 
control on market access and pricing of the power industry, and at the same time delegated part of 
the authority to local governments. Since then, the Chinese electricity market has shifted from 
central planning to more private investment, competition and less regulation. Relevant policies are 
therefore frequently adjusted and it is difficult to predict how far this liberalisation process will go 
in the future. Today, authority over the energy sector at the national level is distributed over a dozen of 
governmental agencies of which the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) plays 
the most important role. Such a wide distribution of responsibilities has impaired co-ordination, 
formulation, implementation and enforcement of energy policies. In its latest attempt to create an 
effective national energy institution, the government established the National Energy Commission 
(NEC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) in March 2008. The latter has a broad 
mandate, which includes drafting energy plans and policies, negotiating with international energy 
agencies, and approving foreign energy investments. A more detailed overview of NEA's individual 
departments is shown in Table 5. Despite being a formal establishment, the NEA lacks the authority to set energy prices, which has 
remained with the NDRC. Although, the NEA submits suggestions concerning energy price 
adjustments to the NDRC, it is the latter and ultimately the State Council whose approval is required 
for any major energy price change. In China, the responsibility for electricity pricing rests with the 
State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), an independent regulator established under the 
State Council in 2003. The SERC performs administrative and regulatory duties with regard to the 
national electric power sector in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations.

China's national grid is divided into the  " State Grid Corporation of China "  (SGCC) (comprising of five 
sub-grids in the north, connected to a sixth  " Central Grid " , together supplying a population of 
approximately 1.1 bn people) and the  " China Southern Power Grid "  (CSPG) (south China, supplying 
a population of 230 million) as shown in Figure 5 and Table 6. In this respect, distributed power 
generation through stand-alone systems is becoming increasingly confined to areas with very low 
population density and to remote regions of the vast west of the country. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 40 Figure 5: China's power grid structure Table 6: China's power grid companies Power Grid

Authority concerning rural electrification policy planning and financing is located at central and 
provincial levels, but is also shared among different government institutions. Related responsibilities 
may differ regionally and are usually difficult to locate in the relatively complex administrative system. In 1996, with the introduction of the Electric Power Law, the State began to implement preferential 
policies for rural electrification, giving major support for ethnic minority settlements, remote areas and 
poverty stricken areas. Moreover, the central government promoted the development of water 
resources in rural areas, building small and medium-sized hydropower stations to boost rural 
electrification. The State encouraged and supported the use of solar energy, wind energy, geothermal 
energy, biomass and other energy sources so as to increase the power supply in rural areas. In 1999, the 
State Council approved the  " Notification on Accelerating the Reform of Rural Power Systems and 
Enhancing Rural Power Management "  (the State Council Doc. No. 2 1999), which carried out a 
comprehensive structural reform of the management of rural electrification which affected rural power 
marketing, rural power prices, power grids, investment and management. The reform introduced, 
among other things, a practice whereby rural and urban residents in one province would pay the same 
price for electricity. In 2002, the State Council's  " Circular on Program of Power System Reform "  (the 
State Council Doc. No.5 2002) introduced the practice of  " Separation of Power Plants from Grid, and 
Bidding for Generation " , and the State Power Corporation was split into the two power grid companies 
and five power generation groups. In 2007, the General Office of the State Council issued  " Views on the 
Implementation of Deepening the Reform on Power System during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period "  
(The General Office of the State Council Doc. No.19 2007), which standardised the restructuring of 
power enterprises at the county level, and encouraged the involvement of independent power 
companies. Since 2007, the State encourages all types of investors to invest in rural power grids. Table 7: Un-electrified households and populations (early 2006) No Province

reaching 99% and urban areas 100% (IEA, 2009b). In 2006, a total of 11.5 million people were still lacking 
electricity access (see Table 7), with wide variations among provinces. In late-2007, 11.5 million people 
had still no access to electricity (March 2008, China Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development 
Plan by 2020, NDRC). Latest statistics from the National Energy Administration suggest that in 2008, 
2 million rural households still lacked electricity in China, which represents some 9 to10 million people 
(Tang, 2009). Through the deployment of decentralised power systems, the government aims to supply 
10 million people with electricity by the end of 2020. The government however expects that beyond 
2020 some Chinese households will still be lacking electricity. 2.2 Institutional structure for rural electrification The institutional structure responsible for the Chinese electrification process underwent numerous 
changes in the course of the last 50 years. Today, along with the realignment of formerly vertical 
planning structures of the 1990s, rural electrification programmes and projects are hosted by 
numerous entities, divided horizontally by administrative levels and vertically by topic. 2.2.1 Institutional structure – implementing agencies At present, five major government institutions have different functions and responsibilities in the field of 
rural electrification. In addition to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), the State Grid 
Corporation of China (SGCC), the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) 
and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) are all considered to be influential in the 
field of rural electrification. In general, the NDRC approves the rural electrification programmes 
proposed by the National Energy Administration (NEA). The department for new and renewable energy 
of the NEA deals with the bulk of planning related to rural electrification. Recently, the NDRC released 
two guiding documents concerning rural electrification: China's Renewable Energy Development Plan 
(2006-2010) released in March 2008, and China's Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development 
Plan until 2020, released in September 2007. Regarding the actual electrification efforts, implementing actors differ according to whether 
electrification is undertaken through grid extension or through decentralised systems. In the case of decentralised electrification, actual implementation is being done through 
competitive bidding procedures such as in the Township Programme or occasionally through single 
source selection. Implementation agencies can be formerly government-owned companies, start-up 
companies that were formerly government-owned enterprises, or private companies. In general, 
ownership is very challenging to determine, as China is moving from 100% government-owned 
enterprises to private ownership, and the various forms of ownership are often not entirely 
transparent. In the case of rural electrification through grid extension, the State Grid Corporation of 
China and the Chinese Southern Power Grid proceed to the actual implementation. In the case of electrification through grid extension, implementation is undertaken by the grids themselves. 2.2.2 Institutional structure – funding According to the regulation contained in  " Views on Accelerating the Reform of the Rural Power 
System and Enhancing the Rural Power Management " , the central government has primarily Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 43 increased investment for rural power grid construction and transformation through loans from the 
Agricultural Bank of China. Apart from these loans, power companies are encouraged by the central 
government to seek funding for their activities through normal loan procedures. Local governments 
at all administrative levels are also required to increase their support for rural power grid 
construction, and provincial power corporations can borrow funds from them as well. Nowadays 
there is a wide variety of financing sources – government and private – available, through grants, 
loans, direct investment and in-kind contributions (Yao & Barnes, 2007). Government subsidies are 
usually linked to development programmes that include the promotion of new technologies 
(e.g. photovoltaic systems, small-scale wind turbines, biogas applications), electrification of areas 
with unfavourable conditions or social measures such as poverty alleviation. In 1987, a special interest-bearing loan for rural energy was created by the government. This loan 
mainly supported large-scale biogas projects, solar thermal, and small-scale wind power 
technologies. By 1996, the loan amounted to approximately CNY 0.12 bn (USD 17 million). The 
interest on the enterprises' loan was subsidised 50% by the commercial bank. This special loan 
supported the promotion of the small-scale wind turbine industry and off-grid wind power. But 
today, centrally planned rural electrification programmes using decentralised renewable energy 
applications are entirely financed either by the central government or through a cost-sharing 
scheme which features a financial contribution by the respective provincial government. The 
 " Township Electrification Programme " , which financially supported the construction of off-grid 
renewable energy systems (hydropower, photovoltaic systems, wind) in eleven provinces over 
2002-2005, featured a joint financing scheme. The level of social and economic development in 
each of the eleven provinces determined the level of funding granted by the central government. In 
Tibet, for example, the central government covered 100% of the cost incurred by electrification 
efforts, whereas in Qinghai only 80% and in Sichuan only 50% of the costs were covered. Therefore, 
financing commitment for renewable energies is ensured by the government. In addition, the 
government will formulate and implement rural renewable energy tax policies and regulations that 
encourage public and private investment in renewable energy service companies (RESCOs) and that 
ensure extensive renewable energy applications in the vast rural areas of China. China will also 
provide tax incentives on renewable energy technology development and utilisation, on technical 
research and development and on equipment manufacturing (NDRC, 2008). 2.2.3 Institutional structure – recovery process At present, China's rural power management system follows the principle of  " one county 26 one 
power supply enterprise " , ensuring the integrated power management at all administrative levels 
within a county. Therefore, all dwellers in a county are supposed to pay the same price for 
electricity. Power supply enterprises charge fees according to the household consumption recorded 
by metering at the national ratified electricity price. Electricity metering devices are certified by the 
government. Both are measures to unify and standardise the electricity management and supply 
structures (metering, billing, price) and at the same time to improve the quality of the service 
(reliability, electrical stability). 26 Counties are in the third level in the administrative hierarchy of China. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 44 2.3 Description of current electrification programmes and 
objectives In China, the traditional approach to providing electricity to rural areas is mainly through grid 
extension. However, the long transmission lines often result in a small load and huge line losses. At 
present, most regions without electricity are located in western regions and islands in the eastern 
coastal areas, far away from the grid. Most of these areas are rich in renewable energy resources 
(hydropower, solar and wind energy) which can practically and economically provide electrification 
to remote regions. In rural China, electricity is supplied through three channels: a county is 
connected to a national grid, or is supplied through local dispatch, or is self-supplied. Following this 
pattern, China implemented the  " Brightness Programme "  and the  " County Hydropower 
Construction of National Rural Electrification " , using small hydropower, wind and solar power 
generation for the electrification of rural areas. 2.3.1 Historical rural electrification and expected end-use Development of China's rural electrification can be divided into three main stages (Peng & Pan, 
2006). During the first stage (1949-1977), rural communities were the main investors in rural 
electrification efforts; during the second stage (1978-1997) the central, provincial and local 
governments all played fundamental roles; and during the third stage (since 1998) the central 
government is the main investor. In 1997 the government noted that rural electricity supply 
suffered from a number of problems. First of all, the rural grid was old, leading to unreliable and 
unsafe electricity supply. Often the grid had been badly planned and built, leading to poor 
electricity quality and supply disruptions. Large wire losses were pushing electricity tariffs to 
extremes (Peng & Pan, 2006). As a consequence, in 1988 the government launched a major reform 
of the rural power management system, transformed and renovated the rural grids with a view to 
unifying electricity prices for urban and rural dwellers within a same grid. Seven years of grid 
reconstruction and transformation have cost USD 49.5 billion to the Chinese government. 27 The 
provincial grid companies managed and operated the renovation of the rural grids, while the costs 
of network improvement were amortised through the national electricity tariff. Thanks to these 
efforts, the structure of rural power grids were improved and safe operation enhanced the 
reliability (to 99.7%) and the quality of power supply. Moreover, losses due to transmission of high-
voltage grids dropped to 10%, while losses in low-voltage grids dropped by 30% to 45% compared 
to 12% before the grid improvement. 28 This significantly reduced electricity prices in rural areas and 
facilitated the levelling of electricity prices, leading to strong growth in the demand for electricity. Over the last ten years, rural electrification has slowed down as a result of nearly universal 
electrification (around 99%). At present, the emphasis is on modernisation, service and quality 
improvements, poverty alleviation and introduction of new technologies (Yao & Barnes, 2007) and 
innovative solutions for the remaining non-electrified remote areas in the vast western regions of 
China. Table 8 illustrates the characteristics of the five main periods of Chinese rural electrification. 27 Data provided by the Institute of Energy and Environmental Protection (IEEP), and the Chinese Academy of 
Agricultural Engineering (CAEE) for this Information Paper.

achievements Brightness Programme and Township Electrification Programme 
In 1996, the then State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) (called National Development 
and Reform Commission, NDRC, since 1996) launched the so-called  " Brightness Programme "  the 
aim of which was to supply approximately 23 million people living in remote rural areas with 
electricity services by means of decentralised energy systems based on renewable energy resources 
such as hydropower, solar and wind by 2010. The goal was to provide 100 watts of capacity per 
person. During a pilot phase (1999-2002) in Inner Mongolia, 5 500 hybrid PV/wind/battery 
household systems; in Gansu 10 000 solar home systems (SHS); in Tibet 30 PV/battery village power 
systems and 11 000 SHS were installed. According to estimations, approximately 50 000 persons 
had been supplied with electricity. As part of the Brightness Programme, the so-called  " Township 
Electrification Programme "  (2002-2005), with a total investment of CNY 4.7 bn (USD 0.69 bn) 
consisting of special central and local government funds, was used to supply electricity to 989 rural 
townships and villages throughout western China. By the end of this programme, 1.3 million people 
had access to electricity by means of PV, PV/wind hybrid, and small hydropower stations 
(NDRC, 2008). In 2002 and 2005, 842 737 people were supplied with electricity through the Township Programme 
(see Table 9). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 46 Table 9: Township Electrification Programme – overview of beneficiary households 29 Province People

The  " County Hydropower Construction of National Rural Electrification "  programme of the Ministry 
of Water Resources seeks to build a total of 400 high-standard rural hydropower electrification 
systems in 400 counties, thereby providing electricity to 880 000 people without electricity and to 
4.85 million people with insufficient electricity provision by 2010. Moreover, water authorities are 
responsible for building small hydropower stations to replace conventional energy sources for 
cooking and heating, supplying 1.7 million rural households (around 6.77million people). The goal is 
to ensure electricity access to at least 99.9% of China (Chen Lei, 2009). By the end of 2008, 45 000 small hydropower stations were installed with a combined capacity of 
51 GW, supplying electricity to 300 million people living in rural areas with hydropower sources. 31 In 
this context, the electrification rate in rural hydropower areas increased from 40% in 1980 to 
99.96% in 2008. In the course of the 10 th Five-Year Plan the central government spent CNY 115.5 bn 
(USD 16.94 bn) to support the construction of 410 small hydropower stations with a total capacity 
of 10.6 GW, or 30 MW per county (Chen Lei, 2009). Power for All 
The aim of the State Grid Corporation's  " Power for All "  programme is to reach 4.5 million people 
(1.2 million households of the 1.5 million without electricity) in 26 provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities by 2010. As can be seen in Table 10, at the end of 2007, out of a total of 
498 235 administrative villages within the State Grid Corporation of China, only 1 694 administrative 
villages were still without electricity, an electrification rate of 99.66%. Moreover, out of a total of 
192 308 000 rural households within the State Grid Corporation's area, 250 000 households were 
without electricity, an electrification rate of 99.87% of households. According to the State Grid 
Corporation, almost every province has realised electrification through grid extensions except for the 
sparsely populated north-western provinces of Tibet, Xinjiang and Qinghai (State Grid Corporation, 
2008). 31 This impressive result derives from sustained efforts from the Chinese government to electrify the country 
through small hydropower applications. This surpasses the  " County Hydropower Construction of National 
Rural Electrification " . Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 48 Table 10: State Grid Corporation's achievement in electrification of administrative villages and

The China Southern Grid Company aims to have completed the construction of power grids at the 
county level by 2010, investing a total of USD 7.2 bn for the supply of electricity to 
410 000 households through grid extension. At the end of 2008, out of a total of 
63 249 administrative villages, only 37 (all located in Yunnan Province) still lacked electricity access, 
with an access rate of 99.94%. Moreover, out of a total of 47 614 000 rural households 
232 800 were without electricity, a rate of 99.51% (State Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2009). Table 11: China Southern Grid's achievement in electrification of administrative villages and

In late July 2009, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), 
and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) jointly announced to financially support 
the deployment of up to 500-600 MW of large-scale solar PV in both on-grid and off-grid areas by 
2012. The programme aims at all provinces with a cap of 20 MW per province. Investments for on-
grid solar power projects will be 50% subsidised by the government and off-grid systems will be 
70% subsidised. Subsidies are conditional on the requirement of 20 years service life of the 
installation. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 49 2.3.3 Total achievements: all programmes taken together Table 12 illustrates the distribution of the remaining un-electrified households/populations for each 
province in early 2006. Comparing Table 13 with Table 12, between December 2001 and early 2006, the number of non-
electrified households was reduced from over 7 million to close to 2.7 million by means of grid 
extension, decentralised renewable energy systems, resettlements, etc. This means that more than 
4 million households gained access to electricity in almost 6 years. Table 12: Status of un-electrified households and population (early 2006) No. Province

Grid extension has always been the favoured option when it came to China's rural electrification. 
Where decentralised solutions existed, they were usually considered as preliminary electrification 
measures. From the point of view of end-users living in rural areas, electricity generated from 
decentralised renewable energy systems was perceived as  " inferior "  and  " not always available "  and 
therefore not the most favoured option. But recently, renewable energy technologies, both grid-
connected and stand-alone, were perceived as viable options for electricity production. This change 
in perception is true for both the Chinese government and the Chinese population. Today, the increasing difficulties to bring electricity to the remaining villages in the far west of the 
country by grid extension, has led to questioning whether  " full grid coverage "  is economically 
justified compared to using cheaper decentralised off-grid options. Because the last 11.5 million un-
electrified people are difficult to reach through grid extension, the government now aims to supply 
electricity to 10 million people by the end of 2020 through the deployment of decentralised power 
systems (China's Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development Plan until 2020 released by 
NDRC in March 2008). Providing electricity to populations in remote, off-grid areas is a clear 
objective of the ongoing 11 th Five-year Renewable Energy Plan, primarily featuring the deployment 
of clean and renewable energy in the following order of priority: small hydro, PV village systems, 
PV/wind hybrid systems, small wind turbines, and solar home systems. In areas with strong 
hydropower potential, small hydro projects will be developed as a priority, because of the lower 
cost per kWh generated. In areas with no water resources, small solar PV stations, PV/wind hybrid 
stations, small wind turbines, solar home systems will be installed to provide electricity to over 
1 million households by the end of 2010. Target areas are Tibet, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, 
Yunnan, Gansu, and others. Today, one-third of the total rural electricity consumption is supplied by 
local small hydropower (Chen Lei, 2009). Preference for locally made stand-alone technologies 
In the late 1990s some equipment like small wind turbines, PV, SHS, had to be imported, because in 
most cases these projects were part of bi-and/or multi-lateral technical co-operation. However, in 
the course of the Brightness Programme, and notably the Township Electrification Programme from 
April to July 2002, five nationwide public tenders were conducted to select system integrators 32 to 
design, procure and install systems. Almost all equipment was domestically manufactured. Even in 
projects financially supported by the German Bank for Reconstruction (Kreditanstalt für 
Wiederaufbau, KfW), the equipment was locally produced except for the PV modules and inverters. 2.3.5 Description of expected end-use of electrification In the framework of rural electrification through decentralised renewable energy systems, the 
Chinese government considers supplying electricity only for lighting, TV and radio as means to 
support both basic social and economic development goals. Productive use of electricity by 
households, as in the case of the Township Electrification Programme, is prohibited because it is 
rightly expected that electricity demand would soon exceed the capacity of the installed battery 
system. Frequent replacements of battery banks would consequently cause higher costs for 
operation and maintenance. In isolated cases, end-users have however purchased small processing 32 These system integrators are former government-owned companies, start-up companies from former 
government-owned or privately-owned companies. Ownership is often unclear to determine in China. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 52 equipment such as flour-grinding machines, oil seed pressing equipment, or even welding machines 
to generate additional income. The distribution of end-use appliances has considerably changed over time. Table 14 illustrates the 
starkly different distribution of common household appliances between rural and urban households 
and also reflects China's enormous economic development in the course of the last decades (Pan et 
al., 2006). Table 14: Electric appliances in rural and urban households (per 100 households) 1980

69.8 Source: Pan et al. (2006). Recent statistics from the National Energy Administration suggest that in 2008, 99.2% of rural 
households have colour television sets, 49.1% have washing machines, 30.2% have refrigerators and 
9.8% have air-conditioners. This is a huge advance in rural households' quality of life (Tang, 2009). The government sees electrification in poverty-stricken rural areas through small hydropower as a 
means to improve production, promote economic and social development, and increase the income 
of rural dwellers through employment opportunities provided by growing industries (Chen Lei, 
2009). Electricity generated through hydropower systems is therefore expected to raise rural 
incomes and facilitate the social and economic development in rural areas. 2.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs 2.4.1 Costs Rural grids 
Since 1998, China has invested more than CNY 400 bn (USD 58.68 bn) in construction of power 
plants in rural areas (Tang, 2009) of which USD 49.5 billion over the past seven years. 33 By the end 
of 2005, the State Grid Corporation had invested over USD 27.89 billion in two phases of rural 
power grid renovation (State Grid Corporation of China, 2009); USD 5.98 billion was invested in the 
renovation of county power grids and USD 50.81 million in the renovation of the western power 
grid; 20 % of these investments came from Treasury Bonds as capital, the remaining 80% from bank 
loans. After the renovation of the rural grids, the depreciation cost and financial cost of the State 
Grid Corporation have increased substantially. According to the "Rural Grid Programme for the 
Eleventh Five-Year Period by the State Grid Corporation", during the period covered by the plan, the 
estimated investment in rural grids by the Corporation will be USD 16.57 billion, of which 
USD 3.31 billion of capital, and USD 13.26 billion of bank loans. The average annual investment will 
be USD 3.26 billion, of which USD 0.65 billion of capital, and USD 2.61 billion of bank loans. 34 33 Data provided by the Institute of Energy and Environmental Protection (IEEP). 
34 Detailed cost data for the programmes of the Southern Grid Corporation of China are not available. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 53 Brightness Programme/Township Programme 
The national  " Township Programme " , authorised by the State Council in 2001, was initiated in mid-
2002 with the goal to supply electricity to the remaining 1 065 administrative townships 35 in rural 
western China. The programme has cost CNY 4.97 bn (USD 730 million) of which CNY 2 bn 
(USD 293 million) came from the central government and the rest from provincial and township 
governments. Through a competitive bidding procedure at the provincial level, the so-called system 
integrators responsible for the installation, operation and maintenance for three years were 
selected. Most systems were installed during the mid-2002 to 2004 period. In total, 989 power 
stations were constructed of which 721 are PV and PV/wind hybrid systems with a total capacity of 
15.53 MW and 146 small hydropower stations with a total capacity of 113 MW. The subsidy needed to facilitate the operation of decentralised renewable energy systems, mainly 
photovoltaic, amounted to a total of approximately CNY 20 million (USD 2.93 million), the average 
subsidy being about CNY 2 900/kW of installed capacity in one year. 2.4.2 Framework conditions and business incentives Historically, rural electrification through grid extension or decentralised renewable energy 
applications in order to achieve nationwide electrification is the mandate of the government. This 
mandate is reflected in previous and future Five-Year National Development Plans that outline 
relevant rural electrification undertakings with their corresponding budget. In late 2002, worldwide experience with PV and PV/wind hybrid systems in villages − seen from 
institutional, social, economical, environmental and technical angles − was extremely limited. This 
explains why the private sector did not engage in the implementation of the Township Electrification 
Programme. The main actors remained government-affiliated institutions or semi-private entities such 
as spin-off companies from former government institutions previously involved in rural electrification 
projects and that had already gained experience. In this context, because certain criteria had to be 
fulfilled to be selected as participant in the competitive bidding procedure, companies with a track 
record were in an advantageous position compared to  " potential newcomers in the business " . 
Moreover, when selecting the so-called  " system integrators " , these were considered responsible for the 
construction, maintenance and operation of these decentralised village power systems for three years, 
and contracts stipulating tasks, responsibilities and modes of payment were signed. Since all constructed 
systems were off-grid, no public-private partnerships had to be arranged. As of today, although the 
contracts came to an end, some system integrators still operate, maintain and organise the supply of 
spare parts, and train local technicians for these off-grid systems. 2.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed China is currently facing challenges in its objective of 100% rural electrification. Theft and vandalism 
China has no official statistics regarding electricity losses due to theft or vandalism whether for rural 
grids or stand-alone systems. However, theft and vandalism do occur and are perceived as 
problems which require an urgent solution. In the absence of effective supervising mechanisms, 35 From an administrative point of view, once these remaining townships are electrified, China will have 
attained 100% electrification of townships (excluding administrative villages, villages and natural villages 
where the other 11 million people are living). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 54 damage and theft of equipment have become a serious concern in that they affect the operation of 
power plants. There is a widely shared view that measures need to be taken during the system 
construction itself. In the case of the Township Electrification Programme, in late 2006 stolen PV 
modules were reported to the responsible Provincial Department of Reform and Development 
Commission with a view to obtain funding for replacements. In some cases, PV modules have been 
welded to the basic structure so as to create additional hindrances for potential thieves. By 
comparison, privately owned local systems are under better control, especially solar home systems, 
small-scale wind turbines and pico-hydropower stations, and are therefore less subject to theft and 
vandalism. Prohibitive operational costs 
For decades, China's focus has been on securing power supply for urban and industrial use. As a 
consequence, the gap in service supply between urban and rural areas has been growing. Rural 
areas remained relatively under-developed, and growth in electricity use was slow, seasonal and 
fluctuating over the day. Long transmission lines, coupled with low load density, have resulted in 
high costs for rural power supply and little or no business revenues. Moreover, because of past 
management practices of some county power suppliers, these were heavily indebted and the 
majority of their workers were unskilled. These prohibitive operational costs have discouraged 
potential investors. Centralised structures, rooted in history and politics, were preferred, resulting 
in grid extensions to areas with high construction costs, transmission losses and maintenance 
expenses, instead of opting for decentralised solutions. However, with its goal to electrify an extra 10 million people by 2020 through the use of locally 
available renewable energy resources, and the sharp fall of application costs for renewable energy 
systems during the last decade, China is striving to become the world market leader for PV and 
wind energy technology. The lower costs incurred by growing domestic demand will be a strong 
economic incentive for greater industry involvement. Low quality of rural electricians 
Before the reconstruction of rural grids, the low level of electrification in rural areas required work 
from only ordinary unskilled electricians. These were usually farmers whose main income came 
from agriculture, but who worked part-time for electricity companies, even collecting the bills as 
part of their tasks. However, with electrification spreading to rural areas, the technological 
complexity of electricians' work increased. The need for constantly improving electricity services 
has expanded the rural electricity market. Rural electricians are now required to work full-time 
while upgrading their skills. With relatively low wages and an often insecure revenue flow, no 
medical insurance and no pensions, skilled electricians are difficult to find and very few residents in 
economically developed villages want to become electricians. There is no suitable training available, 
and most of the new local technicians/operators have not received any technical training and 
therefore are unable to perform operation and maintenance (O&M) tasks. The government is 
therefore in the process of identifying mechanisms and institutions, preferably at provincial level, to 
ensure that potential candidates benefit from a standardised training in operation and maintenance 
tasks. Operation and maintenance reliability for off-grid 
Commercialisation by private-sector companies bears the risk that after-sale support is neglected 
owing to low profitability. Moreover, with the rapid implementation of the programme, insufficient 
consideration was given to user training, and only a minimum budget allocation for training 
purposes was earmarked in the original budget. The most common perception in the past was that 
 " electricity is a hands-on business "  where no special qualification was required. Today, with 
increasing technical complexity, it is essential to train members of the villages/townships. However, Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 55 here again, the lower level of education among the rural population makes it difficult to recruit 
people with a basic knowledge of mechanical or electrical engineering, who would be ready to 
follow the training courses provided by system integrators, project owners or the like. In general, 
once off-grid applications have been installed, at least two inhabitants of these villages/townships 
will be appointed by the village/township government to serve as rural technicians and to perform 
basic operation and maintenance tasks such as cleaning PV modules, checking batteries, collecting 
electricity fees, replacing fuses, fixing disconnected wires, and so on. 2.6 Rural electrification progress assessment and conclusion China has made major efforts to restructure its energy system and provide electricity to its remote 
areas. It has succeeded in tackling the problems of electrification by using different renewable 
energy power systems, and abandoning grid extension efforts when these were not economical or 
practical. During the electrification process, China has faced numerous challenges some of which 
remain to be addressed. However, rural electrification in China is no doubt a success story that has 
led to near-complete electrification of the most populated country of the world in a relatively short 
period. Since this process started several decades ago, a distinction should be made between the 
older and recent processes. Keys to historical rural electrification success 
Pragmatism overcame ideology, in the sense that although the central government had absolute 
power and clear plans on how to electrify the country, it yielded administrative responsibility to 
local levels in support of a different approach, more efficient and appropriate to the situation. The 
price that had to be paid for the rapid initial electrification included inconsistent tariff structures, 
administrative responsibility overlaps, low technical quality of installations and often small electrical 
capacities that were suitable only for a limited range of applications. Keys to recent rural electrification success 
The recent and ongoing rural electrification activities are characterised by technically advanced 
programmes to supply electricity to areas with difficult conditions. Government commitment: Whether through grid extension or decentralised off-grid applications, 
universal supply of electricity has been one of the government's objectives. As a socialist country, 
China aims to give all its citizens the same basic living conditions, including access to electricity. As 
with other rural electrification programmes, the government's commitment (through efficient 
planning and sufficient long-term funding) has proven most fundamental to the electrification 
success. Technological flexibility: The  " last remaining un-electrified areas "  means areas that are  " hardest to 
electrify " , with the highest costs if inappropriate means are chosen. This situation was avoided by 
choosing a wide array of technologies to prove their respective competitive advantages. The 
Township Programme was among the first to use technologies such as PV hybrid systems on a large 
scale. Moreover, the use of small hydropower plants in water-rich areas, as in the  " County 
Hydropower Construction of National Rural Electrification " , has brought resource-specific answers 
to electrification concerns. Sense of ownership: Areas with low population density require individual household systems where 
operation, maintenance and ownership are in the same hands. In China, operation and 
maintenance worked best if a strong sense of ownership was present as far as individual Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 56 applications like pico hydropower, solar home systems and small-scale wind generators were 
concerned. Private-sector implementation entities: The competitive bidding procedure of the Township 
Programme sought to minimise implementation costs. However, not all participants to the bidding 
process were equally capable of performing the tasks, since formerly government-owned 
companies had a competitive advantage in that they had acquired experience in rural 
electrification. Remaining challenges linked to grid extension 
Complex administrative structures: Even though rural electricity supply now lies in the hands of 
large power companies after a reform to unify the electricity system, strong county-and township-
level government influence on the management of small hydropower still prevails. There is an 
overlap of responsibilities between the central, provincial and county government players in the 
management of rural electrification and it is not always clear who is ultimately responsible for the 
operation and management of rural electrification structures. This problem still needs to be 
addressed to improve the fluidity and long-term viability of the electrification process. Low level of rural power consumption: According to 2009 IEA calculations, China's total per-capita 
electricity consumption had reached 2 328 kWh in 2007, a 14% increase since 2006. There remains 
a strong urban-rural divide in electricity consumption. This shows that additional and significant 
electrification efforts are needed and that economic development has not yet fully propelled rural 
households to the levels of urban households. Pricing: The Chinese pricing policy remains unclear. There is no market pricing mechanism for 
electricity since prices are still set by the government. Power suppliers are therefore not assured 
the necessary profits. This particularly affects the long-term investment security for investors in 
county-level power systems. Rural power grids are unattractive to investors owing to these market 
uncertainties. The example of the Yunnan Province demonstrated that rural end-users limited their 
monthly electricity consumption to a level that makes it completely unattractive to the electricity 
company to invest further in infrastructure and maintenance. Lack of competition in the county: Supply companies targeting rural areas have always enjoyed a 
monopolistic position. According to the Chinese  " one county one supplier "  policy, the supplier is to 
provide the full range of services at a given price. Market access by other investors is difficult if not 
impossible. This, along with rigid rules on production, supply and marketing of electricity, prevents 
innovation, competition and reform. Prohibitive maintenance costs and lack of funding: Rural grids incur major construction and 
maintenance costs. Although there are maintenance fees, they are insufficient to cover the 
expenses of the ever-increasing assets. Two-thirds of the fees collected through rural electricity 
tariffs are used for building electricity generators, and the remaining third is insufficient for 
acquiring maintenance equipment for grid renovation or development (Luo, 2007). These financial 
burdens negatively impact business revenues. In addition, in the course of the energy sector reform 
which began in 1998, some electricity facilities of the rural grids have been corroded, damaged, or 
generally could not meet the demand, and thus needed either replacement or modification, again 
incurring large expenses. The improvement of living standards and the economic development of 
rural areas, a consequence of electrification, stimulate electricity demand, and put power supply 
companies under permanent financial strain. Rural grids need constant renovation and 
maintenance. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 57 Main remaining challenges linked to the Brightness Programme/Township Programme 
Use of unsuitable material: As a first step towards the ambitious objectives of the Brightness 
Programme, a three-year pilot phase was launched in 1999 in three provinces. A survey conducted 
by the Institute of Electrical Engineering (JKD) in Inner Mongolia in late 2003 (Chinese Academy of 
Science, 2003) revealed that out of 5 240 PV/wind/battery hybrid systems for which statistics were 
available, a total of 2 119 systems (40.4%) were malfunctioning. Problems with the inverters/charge 
controllers accounted for 1 099 sets (20.9%) followed by 657 problems with batteries (12.5%) and 
363 problems with wind turbines (6.9%). On-site investigations suggested that the bearings of wind 
turbines were made out of unsuitable copper material. The main causes of the exceptionally high 
proportion of malfunctioning charge controllers/inverters were poor technical design and the 
utilisation of unsuitable material during assembly. Consequently, the malfunctioning charge 
controller/inverter shortened the lifetime of 657 batteries. As a result, a general dissatisfaction 
among end-users prevailed and led in many cases to the refusal to pay the final instalment for the 
systems. Table 16 provides an overview of future costs to 2020. 36 Unclear long-term operation and maintenance: When the Township Electrification Programme was 
designed, government financial support was almost entirely earmarked for the procurement of 
hardware. Through a competitive bidding system, system integrators were selected and according 
to what the bidding documents stipulated, their responsibility merely included the design, 
construction, operation and maintenance of the off-grid systems. However, this lasted only three 
years. Today, more than six years after the Township Electrification Programme was initiated, a 
number of pressing issues are still pending here and there, e.g. ownership (transfer from national to 
provincial/township government), management (financial and contractual requirements for 
Renewable Energy Service Companies, RESCOs), financial support (governmental subsidies to cover 
expenses incurred for operation and maintenance (O&M) during the 20 years of the system's life), 
tariff setting (official guidelines to set a tariff to be paid by end-users and how the difference in 
tariffs can be balanced through the provisions made in the Chinese Renewable Energy Law). 
Moreover, ownership in most of the provinces has not been defined, so that many entities are 
unwilling to take responsibility for operation and maintenance, causing problems in daily 
management, bill collection, equipment replacements and repairs, etc. Different tariffs (there is no 
single tariff for all townships), lead to insufficient revenues earmarked for O&M. The collection of 
one end-user tariff is not sufficient to cover all the costs incurred for O&M, replacement of 
components, repairs and the monthly salary of local technicians/operators. Thus, continued 
financial support from the government is indispensable. Long-term technical reliability: Many technologies used in the electrification programme have 
never been applied on a large scale and some were even specifically developed for this programme. 
This poses the question of long-term reliability of the technologies applied. 36 In the course of the survey involving 11 out of 13 system integrators, budget estimates were compiled 
covering the potential lifetime of village power PV systems over the 2006-2020 period. In total, four cost 
categories have been identified. -Operation & maintenance of PV systems (primarily maintenance and monthly salary of on-site local 
operator); 
-Cost to cover the technical support rendered by Renewable Energy Service Companies' routine 
inspection, labour, problem-solving, communication, management, reasonable profit; 
-Cost to cover the replacement of equipment (twice battery replacement, major repair, other 
electronic devices such as inverter, controller, mini-grid); 
-Other cost (training and unforeseen expenses). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 58 Unclear financial mechanisms: Besides unclear mechanisms regarding the awarding and control of 
subsidies, there is no model to calculate the real cost of subsidies in support of energy generated 
from renewable sources. Growing energy demand at the local level is straining the entire system, 
notably batteries which often require fast replacement. But who is to pay? The most pressing 
matter is to find sufficient funding to ensure a long-term sustainable operation until 2020. In the 
meantime, to support the long-term financial viability of rural electrification efforts, the central 
government is nevertheless allocating subsidies earmarked for a number of previously implemented 
off-grid electrification programmes, as Table 15 shows. Table 15: Overview of subsidy allocations for off-grid systems (October 2007 to June 2008) Province

electrification is nearly complete. China has achieved an electrification rate of 99.4%, with 99% in 
rural areas and already 100% in urban settings, thanks to the government's aggressive measures 
and strong political will. At present, the emphasis is shifting to modernisation, service and quality 
improvements, poverty alleviation and the introduction of new energy technologies (Yao & Barnes, 
2007) and innovative solutions for the remote areas in the vast western regions of China that 
remain without electricity. The Chinese government estimates that only 1.5 million people will still 
be without in 2020. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Table 16: Operation and maintenance costs (2006 – 2020) Province

70.1 Source: UNDP China (2008). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 61 3 India With the largest rural population in the world, India is facing a huge electrification challenge. Today, 
64.5% of India is electrified, with an electrification rate of 93.1% in urban settings but only 52.5% in 
rural areas (IEA, 2009b). This has been achieved mainly through grid extension or small-scale 
renewable energy systems. Strong political will and sufficient funds have, since the beginning of the 
11 th Five-Year Plan, accelerated the speed of electrification. But India is currently faced with 
insufficient electricity generating capacity, which is seriously hindering the implementation of 
future rural electrification programmes and undermining their viability. India's energy sector, 
electrification efforts and the remaining challenges are detailed below. 3.1 Introduction and country description The Republic of India is the seventh-largest country in the world with respect to its geographical 
area, covering 3.29 million square km and including 7 517 km of coastline. Its terrain ranges from an 
elevated tableland in the south, to deserts in the west, the Himalayas Mountains in the north, and 
flat to rolling plains along the Ganges River. Political context 
India is a federal State divided into 28 states and 7 union territories. Since 1947, the year of its 
independence, it is the world's largest democracy. An elected president is the Head of State. 
Executive power resides with the Prime Minister, while legislative power resides with the Upper 
House (Rajya Sabha) and the Lower House (Lok Sabha). The 28 states have their own elected 
governments, and the 7 union territories are governed by an administrator appointed by central 
government (except for the territories of Delhi and Pondicherry). A governor for each state is 
nominated by the president. The Indian Constitution defines the legislative and administrative 
relationships between the central and state governments but some issues such as electricity and 
economic and social planning are the joint responsibility of both central and state governments. 
Depending on the issue addressed, policies and laws are either set at the central or state level but 
central law always prevails if state and central laws are conflicting (IEA, 2007). In the power sector, policy setting and implementation is divided between five ministries: the Ministry of 
Power (MoP), the Ministry of Coal, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energies (MNRE) and the Department of Atomic Energy, and government commissions and 
agencies. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is a body under the MoP which co-ordinates energy 
efficiency and energy conservation measures, and the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), under the MoP, 
acts as an advisory body to the central government on matters of national electricity policy, and specifies 
technical standards and norms for grid operation and maintenance among other issues. Under the MoP, 
the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) regulates central and interstate-level power-related 
activities, while the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) work on state-level licensing, state-
level electricity tariffs and competitive issues. Among MNRE's main activities is the expansion of the use of 
renewable energy technologies in remote rural areas. State governments also have considerable 
responsibilities in the power sector as they are responsible for the implementation of national laws. They 
can set their own laws and regulations to be applied on their territory. Because of this setting, the 
implementation of power sector reforms differs in each state (IEA, 2007). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 62 Economic data 
India's gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (in billion USD 2000) attained 
USD 4 024 billion in 2009 (IEA, 2009e). In 2007, services accounted for 52.8% of total GDP, industry 
for 29.4% and agriculture for 17.8% (World Bank, 2008). The large share of services in total GDP is 
remarkably high compared to most other developing economies. Average annual growth of GDP 
has also been high, averaging at 6.9% over the 1997-2007 period, reaching 9.7% in 2006 and 9% in 
2007. Over 2007-2011 the economy is expected to grow at an average of 8.5% (World Bank, 2008). 
However, according to the World Bank, the 2008-2009 global financial crisis has caused India's 
economic growth to weaken over that period compared to the previous three years. India's Ministry 
of Finance expects the economy to grow by only 6.1% over 2008-2009 (Ministry of Finance, 2009). Population and its economic profile 
India is the second most populous country after China and the first most populous democracy with 
a total population reaching an estimated 1 139 965 million in 2008, which is about 17% of the 
world's population (World Bank, 2009d). According to the Central Intelligence Agency's World 
Factbook for India, in 2003, 60% of the labour force worked in agriculture, 12% in industry and 28% 
in services; the total unemployment rate across sectors in 2008 was 6.8% (CIA, 2009). India has the 
largest rural population in the world with 828 million rural inhabitants. In 2008, 70.8% of India's 
total population lived in rural areas, progressively migrating to urban areas at an annual rate of 
2.3%, a rate which is below that of many other countries (UNPD, 2008). Figure 7: GDP per capita per state The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on maps included in this publication do not 
imply official endorsement or acceptance by the IEA. 
Source: IEA (2007). According to recent World Bank estimations, the GDP per capita grew by 7.7% in 2007, and is 
expected to grow by 7.2 % over 2007-2011 (World Bank, 2008). Over 1997-2007, GDP per capita Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 63 grew by 5.3%. While such economic development has led to an average increase in the standards of 
living, it has left the agricultural sector untouched, bypassing most of the rural poor. Therefore, 
although India has enjoyed a growth of GDP per capita, poverty remains a challenge. Poverty is also 
more concentrated in some states such as the eastern and north-eastern states as Figure 7 shows. 
India has over 300 million poor people living below the  " poverty line "  as defined by the Planning 
Commission. In March 2007, the Indian Planning Commission estimated that over the 2004-2005 
period, more than one-quarter of India's total population (27.5%) still lived below the poverty line 
(BPL), with a distribution of 25.7% urban dwellers and 28.3% rural dwellers (Planning Commission, 
Government of India, 2007) 37 as seen in Table 17. Table 17: Number and percentage of people below the poverty line in India (1983-2004) Years

27.5 Source: Planning Commission -Government of India (2008). The government of India is hoping that rapid economic growth, coupled with access by all to the 
basic amenities − electricity access, health, education and clean water − will be the keys to levelling 
the income disparity among the rural and urban populations (Planning Commission, 2006). But 
strong economic growth alone does not bring such amenities to the rural poor. For this reason, the 
Planning Commission has been working to establish solid infrastructures such as electricity 
connections, telephone connections, roads, railways and irrigation so as to improve the productivity 
of agricultural and rural industries (Planning Commission, 2006). Rural – urban divide: unequal access to electricity 
In 2005, a total of 412 million people in India had no access to electricity, with 380 million of them 
(92% of total population) living in rural areas and 32 million in urban areas (IEA, 2007). According to 
recent IEA estimates, India is today 64.5% electrified, with an urban electrification rate reaching 
93.1% and a rural rate of only 52.5% (IEA, 2009b). 37 The definition of the poverty line is a major cause for international and internal debate. In India, its 
definition has changed considerably over the years. Since 2006, the criterion used by the Planning 
Commission is the monthly per capita consumption expenditure and is based on a caloric norm. Its definition 
is used to identify individuals who are in need of government assistance and aid. The Planning Commission 
considers that an individual is living below the poverty line if his or her monthly consumption expenditure is 
below Indian rupees (INR) 356.35 in rural areas (around USD 7 or enough to purchase 2 400 calories of 
nutrition) or below INR 538.60 in urban areas (around USD 10.5 or enough to purchase 2 100 calories of 
nutrition). Under this criterion, 27.5% of the Indian population live below the poverty line. Because of major 
debate over this definition, government committees have been asked to rethink the definition of the poverty 
line. In 2007, the Arjun Sengupta Committee estimated that a total of 77% of the Indian population lived with 
less than INR 20 (USD 0.4) a day, with 27.5% living under the poverty line, and some 50% living just slightly 
above it. In June 2009, a committee chaired by the Supreme Court food commissioner N C Saxena, and 
appointed by the Rural Development Ministry suggested a revision of the parameters defining a new poverty 
line, under which 50% of the Indian population would live. Such numbers differ from International 
estimations such as those of the Asian Development Bank estimating that 41.6% of the population live below 
the poverty line of USD 1.25 (PPP) per day (Asian Development Bank, 2009). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 64 Installed capacity 
According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) of the Ministry of Power (MoP), on 31 July 2009, India's 
total installed capacity had reached 151 073 megawatts (MW). Thermal power accounted for 60% of total 
installed capacity with 96 794 MW, hydropower for 24.5% with 36 916 MW, nuclear power for 2.7% with 
4 120 MW and renewable energies for 8.8 % with 13 242 MW (Central Electricity Authority, 2009a). According to the Ministry of Power, at present 86.5% of India's total installed capacity is publicly 
owned, either by the states or by the central government. A smaller share of generating capacity is 
covered by independent power producers (IPP) and industrial auto-producers, which according to 
the MoP operate 13.5 % 38 of all India's capacity (Table 18). State Electricity Boards own around 50% 
of total installed capacity. Public companies owned by the central government, including the 
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) 
and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. (NPCI) control around 34% of India's total capacity. Table 18: Total installed capacity (at 31 July 2009) Sector

regions, followed by the southern and northern regions. The eastern and north-eastern regions, 
traditionally the poorest regions in terms of GDP per capita (Figure 7) have also much less installed 
capacity. Generating capacity from renewable sources is greatest in the southern region, while the 
western region has the most installed thermal power capacity. Table 19: Region-wise installed capacity Region

Electricity consumption per capita is among the lowest in the world, equalling 543 KWh/capita (IEA, 
2009e). Although India has considerably improved its generating capacity, it still has difficulty in 
meeting demand and there are persistent power shortages which constrain India's economic 
growth. With the development of the industrial and commercial sectors as well as the wider use of 
electrical equipment, electricity demand keeps increasing. To meet this increasing demand, India 
will have to make substantial investments in the electricity sector. The country expects to increase 
its capacity by 78 700 MW over the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007-2012). For the long-term horizon, the 
report on the Integrated Energy Policy has projected energy demand to the year 2031/32 
(Table 20). Table 20: Projected electricity demand and supply to 2031/32 Year

Before 2006, the Indian power system was composed of five regional grids operating 
independently, namely the Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern, and North-Eastern Grids. Each 
one covered several states. Since August 2006, all these regional grids except for the Southern Grid 
have been integrated and now operate together at the same frequency. They are now treated as if 
they were one single grid called the NEWNE grid. The southern grid is planned to be synchronously 
operated with the NEWNE grid towards the beginning of the 12 th Five-Year Plan (Central Electricity 
Authority, 2008). Therefore, India still does not have a real unified grid and the intra-country 
capacity needs to be strongly increased to meet the country's needs. Distribution and electricity losses 
Distribution is the weakest link of India's power supply chain as it faces substantial technical losses 
(because of overloading of transformers and conductors, for instance) and commercial losses of 
electricity (because of low metering efficiency, poor billing and collection, large-scale theft of 
power) averaging 33.7% of total generation in 2006/07 with variations by state as illustrated in 
Figure 8. These losses are among the highest in the world. They compare to some countries in sub-
Saharan Africa. They compromise the financial viability of the power sector, and discourage 
investment (IEA, 2007). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 66 Figure 8: Electricity losses by state The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on maps included in this publication do not 
imply official endorsement or acceptance by the IEA. 
Source: IEA (2007). During the 11th Five-Year Plan, the financing needed for generation, transmission and distribution is 
estimated to amount to USD 241 billion, of which USD 65 billion will be allocated to generation and 
USD 30 billion to transmission and distribution in rural areas (Asian Development Bank, 2008). 3.2 Description of current electrification programmes, targets 
and achievements Until 1997, a village was considered electrified if electricity was being used within its revenue area 
for any purpose whatsoever. In 1997 a new definition was adopted whereby  " A village will be 
deemed to be electrified if electricity is used in the inhabited locality within the revenue boundary 
of the village for any purpose whatsoever " . Under this definition, in March 2004 a total of 74% of 
inhabited villages were considered electrified, whereas only 44% of the 138 million rural households 
(60.2 million) used electricity as a source of lighting. However, according to this definition, if only 
one light bulb was kept lit for a nightly hour in the centre of a village or one irrigation pump was 
powered, the whole village was considered electrified. Realising this inadequacy and the statistical 
bias that came with it, the government of India changed its definition for rural electrification in 
March 2004. A village was considered electrified when the following criteria were satisfied:   " The basic infrastructure (such as distribution transformer and/or distribution lines) is 
made available in the inhabited locality within the revenue boundary of the village, 
including available power supply on demand at at least one hamlet/Dalit Basti as 
applicable, and any of the public places like schools, Panchayat Office (village council), 
health centres, dispensaries, community centres etc.; and 
 The number of households electrified should be at least 10% of the total households in 
the village. "  Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 67 As a consequence of this new definition for electrification, many villages that were previously 
considered electrified fell by definition into the un-electrified category. 3.2.1 The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) scheme Targets of the RGGVY 
In February 2005, a large-scale electrification effort, the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana 
(RGGVY) scheme was launched by the MoP to speed up rural electrification under the  " Power for all 
by 2012 "  initiative. The RGGVY is a major programme of grid extension and reinforcement of the 
rural electricity infrastructure.  " By 2009/10 the RGGVY aims to electrify the 125 000 villages still 
without electricity; to connect all the estimated 23.4 million un-electrified households below the 
poverty line with a 90% subsidy on connecting costs granted by the Ministry of Power; and finally, 
to augment the backbone network in all 462 000 electrified villages. The 54.6 million households 
above the poverty line which are currently un-electrified are expected to obtain electricity 
connection on their own without any subsidy" (Planning Commission, 2005). 39 The RGVVY policy 
therefore aims at: 
  " Provision of electricity access to all households (including rural households) by year 
2009 (which includes 23.4 million households living below the poverty line); 
 Quality and reliable power supply at reasonable rates; and 
 Minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day as a merit good by year 
2012. "  (Ministry of Power, 2008) However, the electrification programme as envisaged under RGGVY was too slow during the 10th 
plan period. In January 2008, the RGGVY was further extended into the 11th plan period (2007-
2012) with the following new conditions for its better implementation:  States are to ensure a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of power supply; 
 States are to ensure quality and reliable power supply at reasonable rates; 
 The deployment of franchisees is mandatory for the management of rural distribution; 
 Introduction of the three-tier Quality Monitoring Mechanism to ensure quality of 
materials and implementation; and 
 States are to notify their rural electrification plans to the Rural Electrification 
Corporation (REC) 40 within six months. Means of electrification in rural areas under the RGGVY 
Under the RGGVY, projects would be financed for provision of the following systems:  A Rural Electricity Distribution Backbone (REDB) with 33/11 kV (or 66/11 kV) sub-station 
of adequate capacity in every block where none exists; 
 Village Electrification Infrastructure (VEI) with provision of distribution transformer of 
appropriate capacity in villages/habitations; and 
 Decentralised Distributed Generation (DDG) systems based on conventional sources 
where grid supply is not feasible or cost-effective. 39 However, based on a review recently carried out by MoP, by the end of the 11 th FYP (on 31 March 2012), 
the RGGVY should be able to electrify 100 000 villages and provide free connections to 17.5 million 
households below the poverty line. 
40 The REC is the nodal agency for the RGGVY. It is a wholly government-owned enterprise responsible for the 
implementation of its rural electrification schemes. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 68 Under the RGGVY scheme, the first approach to village electrification will be through grid extension. Where 
grid connection is either not feasible or not cost-effective, then stand-alone systems are considered which 
can be powered by renewable energy sources or conventional sources, namely through DDG systems. All 
infrastructures must be grid-compatible in order to ensure that when a village is ultimately connected to 
the grid, prior investments are not lost. In DDG projects of the RGGVY, the renewable energy technologies 
currently used are diesel generating sets powered by biofuels (non-edible vegetable oils), diesel generating 
sets powered by producer gas generated through biomass gasification, solar photovoltaic, and small 
hydropower plants. Other technologies, such as diesel generating sets powered by biogas (from animal 
waste), wind hybrid systems or other hybrid systems, including any  " new "  technology, are currently not yet 
popularly used for DDG in India, but may be used in the future. Moreover, although diesel is the easiest 
form of decentralised power generation, the government of India encourages its use only for stand-by 
options or in the case of temporary disruption of renewable energy supply. The general rule of thumb 
supposes that the technology with the lowest marginal cost and which is considered the most appropriate 
and effective technological option for the area will be chosen. Achievements of the RGGVY 
During the 10th plan, 235 projects sanctioned at an investment of INR 97.33 billion 41 (approximately 
USD 2.43 billion) covered the electrification of 65 419 un-electrified villages and provision of free 
electricity connections to 8.31 million BPL households (Ministry of Power, 2009a). At the end of the 
10th plan period (31/03/2007), 38 525 villages were electrified and 672 000 BPL households had 
been provided with electric connections (see Table 22). After approving the continuation of RGGVY in the 11th plan, in September 2009, the MoP had sanctioned 
332 projects for the period covering the electrification of 49 736 un-electrified villages, the intensive 
electrification of 242 439 electrified villages and free electricity connections to 16.2 million BPL households 
(see Table 21). During the 11th Five-Year Plan, focus has been on states that had a heavy backlog of un-
electrified villages and BPL households, as well as on special category states (such as north-eastern states, 
Himachal, J & K and Uttarakhand), border districts and districts led by left wing extremism. In September 2009, a total of 567 projects had been sanctioned under the RGGVY, covering the 
electrification of 118 499 villages, the intensive electrification of 354 375 already electrified villages 
and the free electricity connections of 24.6 million BPL households at an estimated cost of 
INR 262.56 billion (approximately USD 5.421 billion) as show in Table 21. The expected completion 
cost is estimated as INR 330 billion (or USD 7 billion) (Ministry of Power, 2009a). Table 21: Overall status of the progress of project implementation under the RGGVY at 01/09/09 Proposals

29.4 3.2.2 The Remote Village Electrification (RVE) Programme Targets 
Since 2005, the RVE programme of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energies (MNRE) has been 
supplementing the efforts of the Ministry of Power (MoP) through complementary measures for 
the provision of basic lighting/electricity facilities through renewable energy sources. The Remote 
Village Electrification programme (RVE) is responsible for electrifying un-electrified remote census 
villages (with a population of less than 100 inhabitants 42 ) and remote un-electrified hamlets of 
electrified census villages where grid connection is either not feasible or not economical (because 
they are located in forests, hills, deserts or islands) and where DDG projects are not implemented 
by the RGGVY of the MoP. The scope of the RVE is the provision of electricity for:   " All un-electrified remote census villages by 2007; 42 The electrification of villages comprising more than 100 inhabitants will usually be undertaken by the 
RGGVY scheme through its DDG (decentralised distribution and generation) projects. To avoid overlap of 
efforts, close co-ordination between the RRGVY and the MNRE is ensured mainly through the Rural 
Electrification Corporation. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 70  All households of un-electrified remote census villages by 2012; and 
 All un-electrified remote hamlets of electrified census villages by 2012. "  (Ministry of 
New and Renewable Energies, 2003-2004) The RVE programme is implemented in the states by state-notified implementing agencies, which 
receive 90% capital subsidy from the MNRE. A remote village or remote hamlet will be considered 
electrified if at least 10% of the households are provided with lighting facility. Under the RVE 
programme, the electrification process entails choosing the most adequate energy technologies 
through the identification of locally available energy resources. However, in the case where these 
solutions are proven unfeasible, and if the only means for electrification is through use of isolated 
lighting systems (such as solar PV), these should be taken up. However, the remote villages 
receiving them should not be declared electrified. In fact, where the population is scarce and 
remote, there is often no other renewable energy option but the installation of solar photovoltaic 
(SPV) home lighting systems. According to the MNRE, a total of 95%, a large share of remote census 
villages are provided with solar photovoltaic home lighting systems. However, these villages are not 
considered properly electrified until further solutions are implemented (Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energies, 2007). Means of electrification 
Under the RVE programme, solar photovoltaic home lighting systems, small hydropower plants, 
biomass gasification systems in conjunction with 100% producer gas engines or with dual-fuel 
engines using non-edible vegetable oils, non-edible vegetable oil-based engines, biogas engines, 
solar photovoltaic power plants are the most commonly used by the MNRE (Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energies, 2007). However, the vast majority, 95%, of remote census villages taken up for 
electrification under the programme are provided with SPV home lighting systems. Many villagers in remote areas serviced under the RVE programme that are not recipients of grid-
distributed power feel discriminated against when they are provided with what they feel is  " second-
class electricity " . Such complaints have been taken up by some political parties which have been 
exerting pressure for grid power to reach their constituents, as opposed to stand-alone systems. As 
a consequence, the list of villages to be electrified under the Remote Village Electrification (RVE) 
scheme is being shortened each year. In any case, such electrification is still considered an interim 
solution as, ultimately, the grid is expected to reach these regions. Achievements of the RVE 
The RVE programme of the MNRE covers remote un-electrified villages which are not covered under 
the RGGVY. In March 2009, the cumulative sanctions under the RVE programme had reached 
9 355 villages and hamlets of which 5 410 have been successfully electrified. At the end of the 
11 th Plan, a total of 10 000 villages and hamlets should be covered. By March 2009, 2 600 villages 
and hamlets had been electrified (Ministry of New and Renewable Energies, 2009). Table 24: Physical progress of implementation of the RVE at end March 2009 Cumulative sanctions since inception of RVE

Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 71 3.2.3 The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was launched on 23 November 2009 in a statement to 
Parliament by the Union Minister for New and Renewable Energies. This mission is part of the 2008 
Indian National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which seeks to reduce India's future 
reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Although the JNNSM has not been established to foster 
rural electrification per se, it does mention the use of solar energy as a means for rural 
electrification, thus helping the MNRE with its electrification goals. By the end of the 13th Five-Year 
Plan, in 2022, the JNNSM should have led to an installed capacity of 20 000 MW and the 
deployment of 20 million solar lighting systems in rural areas. 3.2.4 Description of the expected end-use of the electricity provided 
under RGGVY and RVE Before 2004, rural electrification efforts were geared towards the electrification of villages and the 
energisation of irrigation pump sets. The main use of electricity in rural settings was for irrigation 
which allowed for the optimisation of crop yields and consequently grain production self-
sufficiency. Previously suffering from food deficits, India became a food surplus country thanks to 
rural electrification efforts geared towards the agricultural sector. But this major economic benefit 
was captured mainly by already well-off farmers, leaving aside rural industries and trades which 
were not targeted by the electrification process (Bhattacharyya, 2006). Under the RGGVY and the RVE, villages should be provided with electricity not only for domestic 
lighting, but also for productive end-uses, specifically targeting the development of economic 
activities within a given rural area. Electrification is expected to reverse the downward trend in 
agricultural growth which is plaguing rural India. Access to affordable and reliable electricity is 
expected to meet the energy requirements of the agricultural sector by energising irrigation pump 
sets as well as small and medium-sized industries, cold chains, health centres, schools, etc. Rural 
households are expected to play an active role in the region's economic development, which should 
lead to an increase in the revenue deriving from these activities. The final goal is the development 
of productive activities which will generate funds to cover the costs incurred by power supply, 
operation and maintenance of the systems. Some states, such as Punjab and Tamil Nadu, have decided to provide free electricity to farmers to 
support their agriculture. In these states, other categories of customers, such as the domestic and 
industry sectors, have been burdened with heavy tax rates to support the deficits created by the 
provision of free electricity to agricultural consumers. According to the Associated Chamber of 
Commerce of India (Assocham), these losses reach each year around USD 400 000 (22 % of annual 
sales of power) in Punjab and USD 235 000 (6% of annual sales of power) in Tamil Nadu (Assocham, 
2008). As a consequence of this free power provision, utilities in these states have been unable to 
supply reliable electricity to their industrial sector, thus reducing their competitiveness vis à vis 
other states, as noted by the Assocham. In addition, controversies over the allocation of free power 
to farmers have worsened because farmers are using their electric pump sets for other purposes 
than irrigation. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 72 3.3 Institutional structures for rural electrification 3.3.1 India's power sector reforms, and policy reforms to promote 
electricity access The government of India has reformed the institutional and regulatory framework of its power 
sector. Reforms have ranged from unbundling of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), increased 
involvement of the private sector in generation, transmission and distribution, to freer setting of 
electricity tariffs (Asian Development Bank, 2008). These reforms have led to furthering 
electrification efforts in rural areas. The  " Power for All by 2012 "  initiative was launched by the 
central government in 2001. The objectives of the programme are to ensure  " sufficient power to 
achieve a GDP growth rate of 8%, reliable and quality power, optimum power costs, commercial 
viability of the power industry as well as power for all "  (Ministry of Power, 2009c). The Electricity 
Act of 2003 followed. It is currently the major piece of legislation covering generation, transmission 
and distribution of electricity in India which compels utilities to supply electricity to all (including in 
rural areas). Moreover, the National Electrification Policy (NEP) of 2005 (which states that the key 
objective of the power sector is to supply electricity to all areas, including rural areas), the Rural 
Electrification Policy of 2006 (provision of electricity to all households by 2009, quality and reliable 
power at reasonable rates and minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day as a 
merit good by 2012) and the National Tariff Policy of 2006, were all policies encouraging 
electrification efforts in rural India. These policies have improved the financial and institutional 
status of the state utilities, and of the state-level generation, transmission and distribution utilities. 
They have widened the state governments' scope of action in rural electrification efforts. As a result 
of the power sector reform process, most state utilities have been unbundled and split into 
separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution of power. 3.3.2 The central and state governments' responsibilities in rural 
electrification programmes The launching of the RGGVY scheme in 2005 marked a turning point in India's rural electrification 
efforts. In accord with the Electricity Act of 2003, the role of the central government became larger, 
as both central and state governments took over joint responsibility for rural electrification. State 
governments are now required to prepare rural electrification plans designed to assess in detail the 
means by which electricity is to be delivered − i.e. through grid extension or stand-alone systems − 
to the un-electrified households in their constituency. These plans also describe which available 
technologies will be considered, how compliance with environmental norms will be met, as well as 
more general information such as the number of un-electrified households in the target region and 
their distance from the grid. These plans are then co-ordinated between state governments, state 
utilities and other agencies by the Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), a governmental 
body under the Ministry of Power that acts as the nodal agency for the RGGVY. State governments 
are also required to ensure revenue stability of their state utilities if electricity is provided at a tariff 
below what is set by the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, to supply electricity to rural and 
urban households without interruption, to deploy franchisees and to appoint independent 
franchisees for monitoring the work. At the central level, the MoP develops rural electrification 
policies, monitors the programme's progress, sanctions projects and releases funds for project 
implementation. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 73 3.3.3 Institutional structure – implementing agencies Under the RGGVY, state governments through their State Power Utilities (SPUs) are responsible for 
implementing the RGGVY in their territory. Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) 43 can also 
assist the states in carrying out rural electrification projects through project formulation, planning 
and monitoring, and the provision of goods and services. The Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) 
has therefore entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with some PSUs, namely NTPC, 
Powergrid, NHPC and DVC to make available management expertise and capabilities to the states 
that wish to work with them. The REC, as the nodal agency of the RGVVY, not only acts as a lending 
agency, but also co-ordinates activities between the MoP and the MNRE, sets the framework for 
project implementation and monitors and evaluates projects to ensure their timely 
implementation. Under the Remote Village Electrification programme, state nodal agencies are responsible for the 
implementation of rural electrification projects. 3.3.4 Institutional structure – lending agencies Under the RGGVY, the MoP grants 90% of the cost of rural electrification projects. States are 
supposed to cover the remaining 10% of the cost either from their own funds or through loans from 
the REC or other institutions. The three main financial agencies in the power sector are the Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd. 
(REC), the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency 
(IREDA). Only the REC is authorised to act as the nodal agency or lending agency for rural 
electrification projects under RGGVY. IREDA supports a much wider range of projects in rural areas, 
including minor-scale rural electrification schemes through renewable energy applications focusing 
mainly on biomass and solar PV lighting systems. The PFC lends only to major generation and 
transmission projects, but not to rural electrification programmes. The Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd. was created in 1969 as a wholly government-owned 
enterprise or nodal agency exclusively responsible for the implementation of rural electrification 
schemes, through long-term financing and promotion of rural electrification projects in India. 
Through the development of the power infrastructure in rural India, it has participated in the 
development of the agricultural sector. Since its creation, the REC is India's main financing 
institution for rural electrification and benefits from strong support from the government of India. 
Today, although the REC continues to foster the development of rural electrification in India, it also 
finances other segments of the power sector. The REC administers grants and provides loan 
assistance to the State Electricity Boards/State Power Utilities for investment in rural electrification 
schemes through its head office and 17 field offices. These field offices are essential to the work of 
the REC as they collaborate with the state governments in which they are settled to help them 
formulate various schemes and loan sanctions. On the basis of the proposals made by the states, 
the REC divides responsibilities for electrification between the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of 
New and Renewable Energies. In this respect, the REC decides which villages or hamlets will be 
considered remote (where grid connection is either not feasible or not cost-effective) and therefore 
which will be electrified through either the RGGVY or the Remote Village Renewable Energy 
Programme (RVREP). 43 A Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) is a government-owned corporation in which the government (whether 
central, state or territorial governments, or all of them) own more than 51% of the company. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 74 The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) was established in 1987 under the 
administrative control of the MNRE for the promotion of financial assistance in favour of renewable 
energy and energy efficiency projects. One of the main objectives of IREDA is to act as a fund for the 
financing and promotion of new and renewable energy sources and to assist in their rapid 
commercialisation. In this respect, IREDA has found its role in providing financial support for the use 
of renewable energies in the electrification of remote villages under the RVE programme of the 
MNRE. 3.3.5 Institutional structure – monitoring and quality check In order to keep up the pace of electrification, the MoP has asked the states to form state-level 
Coordination Committees. These committees are required to meet regularly in order to resolve any 
potential issue that could slow the pace of project development. States are also required to form 
District Committees with representatives from various stakeholders, including elected members 
and local communities. These District Committees help in the co-ordination and review of the 
coverage of electrification within the district. The Ministry of Power has noted that where these 
Committees were active and met regularly, progress in rural electrification projects had improved 
(Press Information Bureau, 2009). In addition, a milestone-based monitoring mechanism has been introduced to monitor the progress 
of RGGVY projects from project sanction up to project completion. A web-based monitoring system 
has also been introduced which works at village level. Through this monitoring system, 
implementing agencies are supposed to provide all the data relating to activities carried out at 
village level, the result of quality inspections, the state of fund utilisation, the state of village 
electrification, etc. 3.3.6 Institutional structure – financial recovery process Electricity connections are free for consumers below the poverty line (BPL). To facilitate recovery of 
customer payments from those above the poverty line, the RGGVY has ordered the creation and 
deployment of franchisees for the development/operation of  " a generation and distribution system 
within an identified contiguous area for a prescribed duration and collect revenues directly from 
rural consumers "  (Ministry of Power, 2009d). Such entities are meant to ensure stable revenue 
flows and services to electricity consumers, by reducing commercial losses through facilitation of 
efficient billing and revenue collection. All franchisees have common activities: they must purchase 
bulk power, and ensure routine operation and maintenance of the distribution infrastructure. To 
ensure the sustained efficiency of the franchisees, the RGGVY applies a process by which 
franchisees are to be reviewed in case they fail to honour their contractual obligations with the 
state government, such as, for instance, if they fail to collect the revenues from electricity 
consumers, or fail to reimburse the cost of electricity. For this reason a termination clause is 
included in the contractual obligations of the franchisee and the state government, if one or the 
other fails to comply. Moreover, the Press Information Bureau (2009) noted that franchisees are 
contributing to the employment of rural inhabitants. In August 2009, franchisees had been 
established in a total of 99 643 villages. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 75 3.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs 3.4.1 Costs of the RGGVY The total costs of schemes under RGGVY have recently been estimated to reach USD 11.3 billion, 
one-tenth of which is allocated to decentralised distributed generation (DDG). This includes projects 
under both 10th and 11th Plans to be completed by March 2012. Total grants allocated by the 
central government are expected to amount to USD 10.2 billion (INR 459 billion). 44 Under the RGGVY scheme, 90% of the project costs is funded by the Ministry of Power. The state 
governments fund the remaining 10% through either long-term loans from the REC or other 
financial institutions, or out of their own budgets. However, government subsidies under the 
RGGVY are expected to be allocated only once to finance the least-cost village electrification 
projects. At the same time, rural households are expected to play an active role in the region's 
economic development, which should lead to an increase in the revenue arising from productive 
activities. The purpose is that the development of productive activities will generate enough 
revenues to cover the costs incurred in power supply, operation and maintenance, and will also 
ensure that no additional government money will be needed to fund the replacement in the future 
of any part of the system. In the event the RGGVY scheme is not implemented in a satisfactory way, 
capital subsidies will then be converted into interest-bearing loans as an incentive to correct the 
implementation of the scheme. Up to 1% of the total subsidy will be allocated to research and 
technology development, capacity building and, inter alia, the financing of pilot studies and 
complementary projects under the rural electrification scheme. For un-electrified households below the poverty line (BPL), electrification projects are 100% 
financed by capital subsidies up to approximately USD 45 (INR 2 200) per rural household. Table 25 
shows the cost norms defined by the Ministry of Power for village electrification. Table 25: Cost norms for village electrification Electrification of un-electrified villages

focuses on those remote villages that are not targeted by the RGGVY), is estimated to amount to 
INR 17 750 million (USD 354 million) over the 11th Five-Year Plan. Similarly to the RGGVY, Central 44 Cost data were provided by RK Sachdev. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 76 Financial Assistance (CFA) of the MNRE grants a subsidy covering up to 90% of the cost of the 
project implementation, up to a predefined maximum of INR 18 000 (USD 360) per household 
(Ministry of Power, 2008). In line with current practice under the RGGVY, the MNRE also offers a 
100% capital subsidy for BPL household connections. 3.4.3 Framework conditions and business incentives Lending agencies 
To encourage banks and other lending institutions to consider rural electrification initiatives 
favourably, the government of India has been working with the National Bank for Agriculture and 
Rural Development (NABARD) and the Reserve Bank of India to facilitate norms, guidelines and 
limits for capital costs. Business incentives 
The Electricity Act of 2003 has contributed to increase competition in the electricity sector. This act 
has given private investors access to all power sector operations. As a consequence, state 
governments encourage the private sector to invest in rural electrification projects. To do so, many 
state governments have established administrative mechanisms to facilitate the process of approval 
and clearance for the setting-up of small and medium-sized industries. Those specifically targeted 
are industries that seek to use local resources for decentralised generation projects and stand-alone 
systems. In this respect, a  " special enabling dispensation "  is considered for stand-alone systems of 
up to 1 MW which use locally available resources and are based on proven cost-effective 
technologies. Such projects will receive immediate approval for the following issues:   " Change of land-use area as long as norms are satisfied; 
 Pollution clearance if the technology is proven to be within norms; 
 Safety clearances on the basis of self-certification conveyed to concerned authorities 
(such certification making the developer fully liable for any infraction to safety 
regulations). "  (Ministry of Power, 2005) State governments are also responsible for setting up institutional arrangements for any 
maintenance service or technical support for renewable energy systems. After sales approach (spare parts, maintenance) 
To make sure that an after sales approach is integrated in the design of the project before its 
implementation, the RGGVY stipulates that any project seeking financial support must incorporate 
plans for regular maintenance and upgrading. Moreover, the projects should demonstrate that 
measures will be taken to minimise technical and commercial losses. To ensure project sustainability under the RVE, annual maintenance contracts (AMC) with a 
minimum 10-year duration warranty must include the replacement of parts or components such as 
batteries, electronics, lamps, bulbs, etc. These AMCs guarantee efficient after-sales support. They 
will be further detailed below. 3.4.4 Customer tariff setting A major problem in India's electricity market is that electricity is often not paid for. Either electricity 
is not billed for or when it is, it is not paid. Also, electricity theft is rampant, with annual losses 
amounting to USD 4.5 billion, roughly 1.5% of GDP (World Bank, 2004). This loss of revenues Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 77 amounts to a mass of implicit government subsidy, as noted in Electricity in India (IEA, 2002b), and 
undermines the efficiency and long-term sustainability of the supply system, and in the long run 
does not benefit electricity consumers. Electricity tariffs are also a sensitive issue in India. Below poverty line households will be provided 
with free electricity connections. By 2012 these electricity connections will be financed with 
government capital up to INR 2 200 (approximately USD 45) per household in all rural habitations. 
Those households above the poverty line will pay for their connection at prescribed connection 
charges and no government subsidy will be released for this purpose. In the case of decentralised 
systems, capital subsidies should not give rise to too many differences between the price that 
remote villages powered by DDG systems will pay for electricity, and the price paid by villages 
connected to the grid. But rural electricity tariffs are often lower than the average cost of electricity 
supply, and state governments are responsible for making budgetary provisions for subsidised 
electricity supply. 3.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed Franchisees and ownership 
The creation of franchisees for the management of local power distribution in rural settings is a 
requirement under the RGGVY. Because these structures reduce commercial losses through more 
efficient billing and revenue collection, they ensure stable delivery of electricity. Franchisees can be 
different legal entities, such as non-governmental organisations, co-operatives or individual 
entrepreneurs. While their exact nature or structure may vary from one franchisee to another, they 
all have common activities: they must purchase bulk power, and see to routine operation and 
maintenance of the distribution infrastructure. Franchisees are granted a distribution licence 
through a competitive bidding process. Those offering the cheapest bulk supply tariff will be 
allowed to operate under a contract with the state governments. Franchisees are particularly 
effective in the management of electricity provision and recovery as they are in close contact with 
the targeted communities, and this has led to a stronger sense of ownership of the electrification 
process. Management and reduction of losses 
Illegal hooking is still rampant in India, particularly in the rural villages, which are by definition 
difficult to control. Through the 2003 Electricity Act, the Indian government made a fundamental 
amendment to the Electricity Act of 1910, rendering theft of electricity a heavily penalised criminal 
offence. Moreover, under the RGGVY, to prevent illegal hooking and so reduce commercial, 
transmission and distribution losses, high-voltage distribution systems (HVDS) are being installed. 
Through HVDS, the voltage profile is also improved and electricity supply is more reliable. 
Franchisees also play an important role in reducing electricity theft, since they are responsible for 
recovering payments and are in close contact with the targeted communities. Corruption and mismanagement of funds have also been plaguing the system, which has caused the 
RGGVY to progress unevenly in the states. To balance this, the release of funds by the REC under 
the RGGVY scheme is now linked to the achievement of predetermined milestones, leading to more 
control of the system. Also the electronic transfer of funds is used right up to the contractor level to 
counter losses from fund mismanagement. Participation of local communities for operation and maintenance 
Under the Remote Village Electrification (RVE) programme of the Ministry of New and Renewable 
Energies, effective operation, maintenance and sustainability of the projects is the responsibility of Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 78 the state governments. The participation of the local community is sought at the inception of the 
project and efforts are made to ensure at least 15 years of operation and maintenance. To this end, 
state governments aim to organise the training of local youth and to set up village committees. 
However, as renewable energy systems develop rapidly, there is often an insufficient number of 
trained workers who know how to maintain and operate systems such as, for instance, solar PV. A 
more systematic approach to training would ensure better maintenance of the installed systems 
(Baker and McKenzie, 2008). Progress monitoring and maintenance 
A Three-Tier Quality Monitoring Mechanism (TTQM) for the projects under the RGGVY has been put 
in place (Ministry of Power, 2009e). For the first tier, a project implementing agency (PIA) works 
with a third-party inspection agency to ascertain that all the materials used in the projects and 
workmanship are conform to specifications. The REC is responsible for the second tier and will 
inspect works and materials. It will also include quality checks of materials at the pre-shipment 
stage. In the third tier, independent evaluators will be contracted by the Ministry of Power for 
random evaluations (1% of villages) of the supply and construction of the projects. These 
independent evaluators will report back to the REC or to the responsible supervisors in the second 
tier, and the REC will make sure that the negative reports are followed up on. This monitoring 
system has been set up to ensure that projects are properly implemented and to contribute to their 
efficiency and long-term sustainability. The RVE also encourages the setting-up of annual maintenance contracts (AMC) with a minimum 
10-year warranty which includes the replacement of parts or components such as batteries, 
electronics, lamps, bulbs, etc. to secure proper and sustained energy supply services. If some 
projects are not covered by the 10-year AMC, sustainability is ensured through revenue collection 
from electricity consumers, which should cover operational expenses. After the AMCs expire, 
revenues could also be used to cover maintenance and repair expenses or replacement of spare 
parts and defective components. Availability and sufficiency of power supply 
Under the RGGVY, state governments are responsible for providing adequate supply of electricity 
with hours of supply being equal for rural and urban dwellers. States are responsible for ensuring 
that at least 6 to 8 hours/day of electricity are supplied in rural areas. Implementation of other policies 
Energy efficiency clauses are one of the keys to the success of a rural electrification policy. The 
government of India has made sure that productive processes are efficient or less energy-intensive 
than standard ones. This applies particularly to the agricultural sector, which has been encouraged 
to use economically viable irrigation pump sets and other energy-efficient farming equipment. 
According to the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), correct implementation of demand-side 
management policies could save up to an estimated 15% of electricity consumption. The legal 
framework for this IEP was provided by the Indian Energy Conservation Act 2001 the aim of which 
was to accelerate energy efficiency in India. Since 2002, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has 
been the governmental agency responsible for implementing the Energy Conservation Act. Some of 
the major initiatives led by the BEE include:  Bachat Lamp Yojana: Promotion of energy-efficient and high-quality compact 
fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to replace incandescent bulbs in households; 
 Standards & Labelling Scheme: Targeting high energy end-use equipments and 
appliances for minimum energy performance standards; Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 79  The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC): Setting minimum energy performance 
standards for new commercial buildings; and 
 Agricultural and Municipal DSM: Demand-side management for the agricultural and 
municipal sectors with special targets on the replacement of inefficient pump sets, 
street lighting, etc. During the 10th Plan, only 877 MW 45 of electricity was effectively saved through energy conservation 
efforts, while the energy efficiency target for the 11th Plan period is close to 10 000 MW. The RGGVY 
also planned to communicate massively through the media in rural areas in order to promote energy 
efficiency, and sound management of the local electricity distribution system. 3.6 General challenges and conclusion During the 10 th Plan, some basic problems hindered the successful implementation of rural 
electrification programmes in India. First, India's rural distribution system is essentially low-density 
with high technical and commercial losses leading to a high delivery cost. Therefore, utilities which 
supplied power to rural areas usually considered such supply as commercially unviable, mainly 
because of the high fixed and variable costs and  " unsustainable commercial arrangements "  
(Ministry of Power, 2005-2006). For this reason, utilities were generally not inclined to take up rural 
electrification projects through funds arranged on a commercial loan basis, for fear of further 
deterioration in their financial health. During the 10 th Five-Year Plan (FYP) there was only limited 
financial outlay for the implementation of the RGGVY, and some cases of government corruption 
and mismanagement of funds have plagued the system. Because of the lack of political will as well 
as multi-institutional involvement and inadequate financial resources for the establishment of basic 
transmission and distribution infrastructure in rural areas, resources were too scarce to allow for 
the complete implementation of the RGGVY scheme during the 10 th Plan. Implementation delays under the RGGVY have also been occurring at the state level. Some state 
governments have been slow in awarding contracts owing to their lack of preparedness for 
implementing projects on a turnkey basis; others have been slow in acquiring land for the 33/11 kV 
sub-stations, others in providing authenticated lists of BPL households (in some states the number 
of BPL households turned out to be greater than foreseen), and still others in providing necessary 
forestry clearance. Sometimes, there was no monitoring because state-level committee meetings 
had not been convened. Difficult terrain and floods in some states have added to the delay in 
implementation of projects. Overall, there has been long-standing unavailability of sub-transmission 
systems, of adequate quantities of material and equipment, particularly poles to be procured locally 
in the project areas, and unavailability of adequately skilled manpower. Finally, franchisee systems 
were slow to be put in place, which led to theft of materials and electricity as well as the non-
payment of bills in some states (Ministry of Power, 2009a). With the 11 th Plan, there was strong political commitment to achieving the goal of 100% sustainable 
village electrification. The apolitical implementation and monitoring of the projects has 
strengthened the programme. But today, India is facing real constraints to widespread 
electrification. India currently has insufficient electricity generating capacity, which is seriously 
hindering the implementation of rural electrification programmes and undermining their viability. 
Whether the targeted additional capacity of 78 700 MW over the 11 th Five-Year Plan will indeed be 
reached and be sufficient to cover the needs for the full electrification of all villages and 45 Data reported by participating units in the National Energy Conservation Awards. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 80 households, remains to be seen. A minimum of 20 000 MW of power is estimated to be required to 
meet the needs of the RGGVY alone (Vidyasagar, 2007). The productive use of electricity at the 
household level would support load development and secure the viability of the electrification 
efforts. Without a defined strategy for encouraging productive use of electricity at the household 
level, the viability of the RGGVY scheme may be undermined. Moreover, the economic 
sustainability of the electrification efforts is also undermined by the lack of systematic evaluation of 
how operations' costs can be recovered. Failure to assess the real potential for cost recovery may 
lead to the need for-long term provision of government grants, way beyond the end of the 
programme (Vidyasagar, 2007). Equally critical is the issue of the effective maintenance and proper 
upgrading of the rural electricity infrastructure as well as its economic sustainability, which will 
depend on the states and utilities' long-term involvement. Finally, to reach the targets set under the 
RGGVY in 2012, it is estimated that state utilities would have to  " gear up their effort by ten times "  
(Vidyasagar, 2007) and provide substantial financial commitment. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 81 4 South Africa Since 2000, the government of South Africa has been seeking to provide universal access to basic 
services, including electricity. In 2009 South Africa achieved 75% electrification with 88% urban and 
55% rural populations who gained access to electricity services (IEA, 2009b). South Africa's 
electrification has been achieved mainly through grid extension. In the future, more renewable 
sources may facilitate further electrification if barriers to their widespread use are overcome. South 
Africa's energy sector, electrification efforts and remaining challenges are described below. 4.1 Introduction and country description Rural electrification in South Africa is part and parcel of the transformation of South African society. 
Since the first free election in 1994, all South African policies − including those of electricity 
provision − contain an element of change. The objective is to eradicate historical inequalities based 
on ethnicity. While a large proportion of poor people live in rural areas, there are also very many of 
them in urban areas. The urban poor live predominantly in townships or in informal settlements. 
During the Apartheid years, Black, Coloured and Asian people were not allowed to live in the same 
areas as the white part of the population. Consequently each city, town and village had established 
areas with good service delivery, and areas with poor or no service delivery. To date, there are still 
areas without basic services such as water, sanitation and access to electricity. This chapter focuses 
on the experience with electrification of the poor who live mainly, but far from exclusively, in the 
rural areas. Figure 9: Map of South Africa The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on maps included in this publication do not

world in terms of size, totalling an area of 1 219 914 km², with a long coastline that stretches Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 82 2 798 kilometres and across two oceans (South Atlantic and Indian Oceans) (CIA, 2009). Although 
South Africa is classified as semi-arid, there is considerable variation in climate as well as 
topography. The climatic zones vary, from the extreme desert in the farthest north-west to the lush 
subtropical climate in the east along the Mozambique border and the Indian Ocean. The terrain 
consists of a vast interior plateau rimmed by rugged hills and narrow coastal plains. GDP in purchasing power parity has shown a steady growth over the past years and is estimated to 
be USD 495 billion in 2009 (International Monetary Fund, 2009). South Africa has one of the highest 
rates of income inequality in the world. The transformation of the society is based on the understanding that economic changes require 
active strategic intervention from the State. This encompasses continued state ownership of 
entities in the energy and transport sectors as well as acting as a catalyst towards the broader 
development of the economy. The private sector is, however, expected to play an active and 
integral role in the economy. Moreover, affirmative action policies such as the Broad-based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE), which obliges companies to comply with a broad range of quotas 
(ownership, management positions, general staff, etc.) for formally disadvantaged groups, are 
furthering the transformation of the society. According to the last census conducted in 2001, total population had then reached 44.8 million. By 
end-2008 total population was estimated to have increased to over 48 million, including some 
4 million immigrants mainly from other African countries (Statistics South Africa, 2009). This gives a 
population density of 39 per km², which is low, ranking 170 th in the world. Table 26: Mid-year 2007 population count estimate and ethnic distribution Total number

languages are recognised. English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial 
public life. Yet English is only the fifth most–spoken home language (South Africa Info, 2008). The 
population is mostly composed of Africans, Coloured and Asians (see Table 26), who are still often 
living in different geographical zones from the Whites. HIV/AIDS prevalence was estimated at 
approximately 11% in 2007 (Human Sciences Research Council, 2009), and life expectancy had then 
dropped to 49 years for men and 52 years for women. Without HIV/AIDS it is estimated that life 
expectancy would be at least 10 years longer for both (Avert, 2009). Energy contributes about 15% of South Africa's GDP. The country's supply and production system is 
well developed, but has recently been facing strong electricity supply crises as well as inefficiencies 46 The term Coloured is used for the people of mixed race.

Note: Before May 2009, the Department cited in the source below was responsible for the energy sector. It 
was renamed Department of Energy (DoE) after the general elections in April 2009 and the restructuring of 
government departments. 
Source: Department of Minerals and Energy (2006). Most of South Africa's energy supply comes from coal (see Table 27). South Africa ranks fourth in 
the world in the production of hard coal, and is the fifth-largest exporter of hard coal in the world 
(IEA, 2008). In 2007, South Africa's electricity generation reached 266 Twh (IEA, 2009a). South Africa 
has an installed capacity of 43 650 MW (Platts, 2008) which represents close to 34.5% of the African 
continent's total installed capacity. Electricity is produced mainly from coal (94%). Eskom – the 
national power utility – generates 97% of the electricity. Around 55% of the distribution is managed 
by Eskom and 45% by the municipalities (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2006a). Since 
1994 no new generation capacity has been built. Because of strong economic growth, rapid 
industrialisation and a massive electrification programme, Eskom's surplus capacity has been 
reduced to below safe production levels. In January 2008, massive power outages occurred 
nationwide. South Africa has since embarked on aggressive demand-side management (DSM), 
energy efficiency, as well as planning new generating capacity programmes. South Africa has one of 
the lowest electricity tariffs in the world with an average selling price at around USD 0.027 per kWh. In 2000 the South African government declared that everybody should have access to basic 
services, including electricity and water. Access to modern energy and water has become a social 
right that must be addressed at national, provincial and municipality levels. The electrification rate 
of South Africa is 75% in 2009. (Electrification is registered as electrification of households and not 
as the number of people). But there is a great variation in the electrification rate between the 
provinces, with Eastern Cape being mainly a rural area and having the lowest electrification rate 
(60%) and Western Cape having the highest rate (86%) as shown in Table 28. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 84 Table 28: Electrification rate in South Africa in 2009 Province

Energy Outlook 2009 (IEA, 2009b) 88% of urban dwellers and 55% of rural dwellers are connected. 4.2 Institutional structures for rural electrification The governance of the electricity sector is the responsibility of the Department of Energy (DoE). 
Before 1994 Eskom was responsible for the electrification of the country. Eskom held a state-
supported monopoly and would electrify an area upon instruction from the government or connect 
a consumer if the consumer would pay. There was systematic neglect of full service delivery to the 
Coloured, Black and Asian communities. In 1994, after the first free election was held, it was 
estimated that approximately 6 million households (Department of Energy, 2009b) were without 
electricity. The backlog in electrification was largely race-based and hence electrification became 
part of the national priorities to redress the errors and inequalities of the past. In 1994, Parliament approved a plan to ensure equal access to basic services for all South Africans. 
The National Energy Regulator 47 was given the task to develop and oversee the implementation of 
the Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP). Eskom was tasked by NERSA to undertake 
the implementation through the use of contractors as part of any other Eskom business. In 2001 it 
was decided that the DoE would be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the 
electrification programme. Municipalities are now responsible for reticulation and distribution of electricity to households as 
well as to small businesses. Eskom maintains direct supply of electricity to larger industries. In 2008, 47 Before 2005, the National Energy Regulator South Africa (NERSA) was called the National Energy Regulator 
(NER). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 85 Eskom generated approximately 97% of the electricity and distributed some 55% to end-consumers 
while the rest was sold to the municipalities, that in turn distributed it to the end-consumers 
(National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2006b). In 2001 the DoE mandated that not only Eskom but also registered municipalities could receive 
national funding to roll out the national electrification programme. DoE is responsible for 
monitoring their actual performance and ensuring that corrective measures are taken in case of 
poor or non-performance. Such poor or non-performance occurs in municipalities that are licensed 
but not yet experienced in rolling out grid connections. For this reason, DoE has occasionally 
provided one-off capacity building support to such municipalities. The electrification programme benefits from a special allocation from National Treasury and not 
funded through cross-subsidies. Once households are electrified, consumers are billed by the 
municipalities. The main funding of the National Electrification Programme is through the National 
Budget. External donor agencies, in particular the German KfW, support the electrification of 
schools and clinics. Also NORAD, the Norwegian agency for development co-operation, provides 
support in the form of capacity building, for example to monitor sale and management of 
electricity, also at the municipal level. In remote rural areas, where the lowest-capacity grid system cannot be supplied within the capital 
expenditure limit and outside the 3-year grid electrification plan, provision is made for non-grid 
electrification through solar home systems (SHS) (Department of Energy, 2009c). An amount 
equivalent to the lower end of average electrification costs is fully subsidised by the government to 
cover part of the capital costs of non-grid electrification. Rural end-users will purchase non-grid 
electricity from the service provider who will, among other things, provide maintenance for the 
SHS. Since these cannot meet the cooking/thermal needs of households, one of the requirements of 
the DoE is that the suppliers of non-grid technologies augment their services by selling thermal fuels 
such as paraffin and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The installation of SHS must be such that the 
maximum densification of the installed base is achieved in a specific area. The service provider, who 
holds a monopoly for servicing an area, must make sure that universal access is achieved in a village 
identified as a non-grid area. In early 1999, the DoE issued a call for proposals for non-grid rural 
electrification. Of the 28 responses received, six consortia were selected through an open bidding 
process to participate in the first phase of a programme to provide non-grid electricity services to 
identified areas. The six private companies are Summer Sun Trading (Pty) Ltd; Shine The Way cc; 
ILITHA Cooperative; Electricité de France; Total Fina Elf Group; Nuon RAPS Utility (Pty) Ltd; Solar 
Vision (Pty) Ltd, and a EUR 50 million support from KfW. The electrification programme deadline has been moved from 2012 to 2014 by which time the 
backlog in electrification should be completed. 4.3 Description of current electrification programmes and 
objectives The Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP) consists of a grid-connection programme, 
a non-grid programme, household connections, electrification of schools and of all registered 
clinics. The main focus is the grid connection, and non-grid connection is only used if there are no 
other feasible options to extend the grid within a foreseeable future. Before 1994, South Africa only focused on electrification of urban areas. In 1993, some 30% of 
households were electrified. Since 1994, there has been a fundamental shift towards electrifying all Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 86 households, including those living in rural areas. The grid electrification rate has since then 
increased from 30% in 1993 to 73% in March 2008 (Department of Minerals and Energy, 2008b), 
that is 4.5 million more households (Table 29). The increase in coverage is the result of both 
extending the grid to new communities such as rural areas and connecting the unconnected in 
already electrified areas. The electrification rates vary depending on the complexities of grid 
extension and population density, with the relatively higher-density areas having been electrified 
first. Table 29: National grid electrification of households by Eskom and municipalities 1994-2008 1994/2001 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 Number of

87 221 Source: IEA analysis. In 2009, 3.4 million households still remain to be electrified in South Africa (Mketsi, 2009) of which 
about half (1.7 million) live in informal settlements. It is a priority of the South African government 
that the problems faced by the 1.7 million households living in informal settlements be resolved by 
their municipal councils, before electrification can be implemented. The areas must either be 
formalised, or the households must move to other formalised human settlements before they can 
benefit from the national electrification programme. This is because it is not cost-effective to 
electrify an unstable dwelling that may be demolished or destroyed by any climatic occurrence. For 
the 1.7 million households in formal settlements, a plan, including budget, is in place to ensure 
connection before 2014. A major challenge in the household electrification programme is the actual 
housing backlog, for which a special policy has been drawn up (Department of Energy, 2009d). The INEP includes special plans for electrification of all clinics and all schools to catch up with all 
remaining backlogs. Schools and clinics can be electrified by using funds from the INEP or through 
donor funding. Adherence to all agreed technical standards is required, whether for grid or non-grid 
connections. By 2007, full electrification of all registered health clinics in the country had been 
successfully completed one year ahead of schedule. By 2007, 700 schools had been electrified but 
the programme has been behind schedule, largely because of poor information abut the number of 
schools to be dealt with in the smaller municipalities (Department of Energy, 2009b; Seshotlho, 
2009). Over the past years, the DoE has undertaken systematic monitoring of the INEP's socio-economic 
impact (Department of Energy, 2009j). Monitoring is carried out among newly electrified 
consumers. (In the longer run it will be interesting to undertake broader economic assessments to 
locate possible long-term changes.) This monitoring exercise has revealed that the majority, 96%, of 
electrified households use electricity for lighting and TV; 63% use electricity also for cooking; a large 
proportion of the population, 34%, use electricity for heating. In comparison, the majority of un-
electrified households use candles for lighting, use wood or paraffin for cooking and wood for 
heating (see following charts). Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 87 Energy used for lighting by electrified an non-

survey (total 2 3830 interviewed) 
indicated that they have benefited 
from electrification. The most 
frequent benefit (71%) was that 
electrification  " makes life easier " . The 
second most cited benefit (cited by 
55% of people interviewed) was  " use 
of electrical appliances " , closely 
followed by  " save time "  (which 54% 
of people interviewed cited as a 
benefit of electrification). Finally, 22% 
mentioned that they  " saved money "  
and 9% had opened small businesses. Only 10% of the households 
indicated that electrification had 
contributed positively to their 
income generation. Of those 10% 
cooking was the most popular 
profitable activity, followed by 
refrigeration (used for conserving and 
selling soft drinks, and meat). A few 
households earned income from 
baking or hair dressing, while only 1% 
of the 10% earned income through 
woodwork using electricity. Communities: 62% of households believed that the 
electrification process had benefited 
their community. The community 
benefits cited were the ability to start 
small businesses (65%), improved 
security (42%) and better use of 
schools. These positive perceptions 
vary from 90% (Northern Cape) in 
some regions to 45% in other regions

Source: IEA analysis. The costs of non-grid electrification, generally viewed as a temporary solution, are less than 10% of 
full electrification costs. The ambition is to achieve a national grid-based supply, and the plan is to 
complete the full-scale national electrification by 2014. However, the currently approved budget 
cycle covers the period up to March 2008-2012 (see Table 31). As can be seen from Table 31, future expenditures are expected to increase, partly because of 
higher costs and partly because the number of connection activities has increased. The costs per 
connection vary greatly from province to province and from year to year and the differences in 
costs are largely caused by infrastructure specifics (Table 32). Adherence to all agreed technical standards is required, whether electrification takes place through 
grid connection or through non-grid specifications. Specific standards adopted as national standards 
under the auspices of the South African Bureau of Standards exist for the full electrification 
installation. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 89 Table 31: National budget electrification expenditures in ZAR (2008 48 -2012) 2008/2009

Source: Gendenhuys & McLaren (2007). Single-wire earth return (SWER) design criteria were reviewed in 1997 to address funding and 
capacity constraints posing challenges to the electrification of rural villages. The standard was 
expanded to allow the use of SWER directly coupled to 33 kV three-phase systems with neutral 
earthing compensator (NEC) earthing. SWER networks were seen as low-cost or cost-effective 
solutions for the provision of network infrastructure in areas where consumption is low (domestic 
and few other applications such as limited water pumping). Take-off points are very sparse and lines 
feeding less than 200 kVA are typically about 100 kilometres long (Gendenhuys & McLaren, 2007). The South African government supports the principle that basic services should be available and 
affordable to all. For this reason, to ensure that the poor benefit directly from electrification, they 
are allocated a 20-amps connection free of charge. Furthermore, there is a 50 kWh free monthly 
allocation implemented by the municipalities insofar as this is possible for the municipalities. The 
50 kWh free basic electricity has been widely debated. While the free allocation is meant to support 
the poor, the very poor might not yet be connected to the grid. And these very poor might live in 
poor municipalities that cannot afford the roll-out of the free basic electricity. In addition, high 
administrative costs are incurred in the application of  " means tests "  in order to verify eligibility for 
free basic supply. To avoid these administrative costs, some municipalities have opted to apply free 
basic allocation to all domestic consumers, with the unintended consequence that wealthy 
consumers receive the free basic allocation if they happen to reside in one of those municipalities. 
South Africa has one of the lowest electricity tariffs in the world, with an average selling price (as 
illustrated below) at around USD 0.027 per kWh. Despite the tariff regime, there is argued and 
documented energy poverty among both electrified and non-electrified consumers (Department of 
Energy, 2009g). The poor segment of the population lives below the poverty line and, despite free 
installation, they may not be able to afford electricity if consumption goes above the free basic 
electricity allocation. 4.4.2 Non-grid electrification Specific guidelines have been put in place to cover those segments that cannot be covered by grid 
extension within the average price and within a three-year plan. In parallel to the general 
electrification guidelines, special guidelines are in place for non-grid electrification, for SWER

informal settlements. The farm dwelling incentives (Department of Energy, 2009h) work such that the government pays a 
locally licensed entity an amount, up to the maximum subsidy payable for the electrification of rural 
households or the actual costs incurred if it is lower than the applicable subsidy. The subsidy is 
based on the cost of the lowest supply size stated in the suit of supply options. This amount is 
determined on an annual basis. As mentioned before, the incentive paid will never be more than 
the actual cost of connection incurred by the farmer. A certain amount of the incentive will be 
retained by the licensed entity to cover the administration costs incurred during the electrification 
project for the farm dwelling houses. This amount may not be more than 10% of the total incentive 
paid out. The incentive will cover the costs of the low-voltage reticulation costs, the service 
connection, the meter (including a three-point plug and a light). The incentive will not cover any 
internal wiring or electrical appliances. The payment of the incentive is subject to a minimum supply 
size of 20 A being installed and a network built in accordance with relevant industry standards. This 
incentive will not be given for the electrification of holiday cottages, dairies, sheds, water pumps, 
churches and schools, etc. The electrification of unproclaimed/informal areas (Department of Energy, 2009d) was sanctioned 
by the Minister of Minerals and Energy in February 2005, as a strategy to catch up with backlog and 
ensure  " Universal Access "  by 2012 (now 2014). As mentioned above, informal settlements need to 
be formalised before they can be electrified. The policy stipulates that in order to be eligible for 
electrification, informal settlements must be in close proximity to existing infrastructure and in a 
position where electrification is practicable and not encumbered by any potential environmental, 
geographical, health or safety hazard. Further, the settlement must be stable (i.e. there is no further 
growth or relocation planned for the foreseeable future). The conditions also include that the 
community supports the proposal and is willing to co-operate with the opening-up of access roads 
where necessary, keep these access roads clear, supply and organise local labour where required, 
and help prevent tampering with or reselling of electricity supplies. 4.4.3 Employment creation The INEP contributes directly to job creation in local areas. Even if many of the jobs are temporary, 
individuals have received some training and earned some income for up to several years. The DoE 
has assessed that the INEP will have created an estimated 6 000 jobs in financial year 2008/09 
(compared to 3 100 jobs created in 2001/02) (Department of Energy, 2009i). The cumulated 
number of jobs that have been created so far by the electrification programme has reached 
32 995 (Department of Energy, 2009j). 4.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed South Africa's rural electrification challenges are those challenges associated with the 
transformation of society to erase the inequalities from the past. While articles on rural electrification often plead for special electricity provision for the poor, this 
argument does not exist in the mainstream debate in South Africa. By declaring that all citizens 
have an equal right to basic services such as clean water, electricity, access to schools and clinics, 
the challenge there becomes an issue of delivery, not just allocation of funds. As South Africa has Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 92 decided that basic services are to be provided by the government, the concern is on optimising and 
providing long-term best economic solutions rather than short-term financial solutions. Pricing 
Sustainable implementation and possible adjustment of current tariff policies are open for 
discussion. Eskom's average selling price was ZAR 0.26 (USD 0.034) in 1979, dropping to ZAR 0.17 
(USD 0.022) in 2005 (Molefe, 2008). These low tariffs are one of the causes of the current electricity 
shortage across South Africa. 49 Because Eskom has sold electricity at ZAR 0.20 (USD 0.027)/kWh and 
imported electricity from neighbouring countries at prices around ZAR 0.05 (USD 0.007), it has not 
been financially feasible for South Africa − as it would not be for any country − to install new power 
generation. In South Africa alone, the generation margin was only 4% in 2008, leading to endless 
power cuts and systematic load shedding. It is now generally accepted that tariff changes are 
needed on top of tariff increases. It is estimated that tariffs will double over a three-year period 
with the first average 28% increase having already taken effect in 2008. The current debate includes 
considerations on differential tariff increases to protect the poor, a  " home-light "  tariff for the low-
income sector, a similar tariff for small, micro and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs), and time-of-
use tariffs. This debate is in line with South Africa's rural electrification agenda, as new power 
generation will be necessary to service more households. Employment 
Employment is a major challenge in South Africa. The average official 50 unemployment figures are 
above 20% (see Table 33), excluding the under-employed in the rural and urban areas or those who 
are not registered in employment agencies. Table 33: South African unemployment rates March 2003

23.6 Source: Statistics South Africa (2008b). As indicated by the results of the 2009 Socio-Economic Survey undertaken by the Department of 
Energy, the rural electrification programme has generated 32 995 jobs over the last eight years. 
Payment for electricity is an issue for people who have no or very little income. Many cases of 
domestic violence in newly electrified households have been amply documented. It is argued that 
domestic trouble starts over priorities when resources are scarce (Habitat for Humanity, 2009). 
However, the long-term effect of ensuring universal access to electricity should lead to general 
opportunities for a broad-based economic development. Providing an area, including a rural area, 
with modern energy can be seen as a tool to attract businesses that can generate jobs locally, for 
example in tourism. There are many examples of increased tourism along the entire coastline of 
South Africa. These jobs and facilities could not have been created without the provision of 49 Another major cause was South Africa's indecision on how to proceed with the privatisation of Eskom, 
which has created much insecurity within Eskom and stalled its plans for capacity expansion. 
50 The unofficial unemployment rate is closer to the international definition of unemployment since people 
who have not been actively looking for a job within the last six months are also taken into account, while the 
official rate disregards them. There are also wide variations between ethnic groups. In the second quarter of 
2009, official statistics report 27.9% of Black/African unemployed, 19.5% of Coloured, 11.3 of Indians/Asians 
and 4.6% of Whites were unemployed. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 93 electricity in the area. The impact on long-term economic development will be interesting to follow 
and assess. Capacity 
Current generating capacity in Southern Africa is insufficient to meet the demand and the reserve 
margin is below a safe 10% operating margin. In 2009, South Africa's maximum installed capacity 
reached 36 208 MW. National plans are in place to expand the power supply, effectively doubling 
installed generation to some 80 000 MW by 2025 with associated grid expansion and strengthening, 
but the implementation of these plans is surprisingly slow. South Africa has not built a power plant 
in over 20 years 51 and, in the meantime, the national expertise to plan, take decisions and manage 
the complex implementation process has eroded. Energy efficiency 
The productive economy, including the building stock and residential appliances, was established in 
an environment of low tariffs and abundant supply. The principle  " save power "  was virtually 
unheard of until 2005 when South Africa launched its first national strategy for energy efficiency. 
Despite this new strategy, it was not until 2008 − when severe blackouts hit the country − that 
South African decision makers were able to win support for changes in the tariff regime and for the 
creation of energy efficiency targets. The shortage of power is now so severe that nationally 
mandated energy efficiency measures have been introduced. Large users of energy have been 
instructed to save 10% power, and municipalities have also asked local customers to reduce 
electricity consumption. There has been some confusion in the public debate in South Africa where 
some argue that supplying electricity to the poor is the cause of the present shortage. However, this 
is unlikely because of the relatively low consumption of poor households. Industry and urban 
residents are the largest consumers and have been benefiting for a long time. National energy 
efficiency efforts should be directed primarily to those who consume the most electricity and 
whose potential for savings are the greatest. In an attempt to maximise and accelerate the 
reduction of the housing backlog, energy efficiency has largely been overlooked in the design and 
construction process. Principles are now established to correct these errors and ensure that all 
houses, including the very small ones, comply with the best-practice energy efficiency standards. 
South African standard SANS204 does prescribe maximum standards for energy consumption. 
National departments and donor agencies are ready to support municipalities' efforts to upgrade 
the housing and building stock so as to prevent future negative impacts on climate change for 
having neglected the construction industry. The DoE launched the appliance labelling programme 
for energy efficiency in 2004 in accordance with the EU standards and labelling programme. 
Unfortunately, there is no financial support to roll out the programme. This is regretful as South 
Africa and the whole of Africa increasingly receive outdated appliances. The DoE will soon start an 
industrial energy efficiency programme focusing on system optimisation with the support of the 
United Nations Industrial and Development Organization (UNIDO), the Swiss State Secretariat for 
Economic Affairs (SECO) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). Finally, the 
DoE is also in the process of signing an energy efficiency project for the building sector to improve 
efficiency in the construction of buildings and houses, including the use of appliances. 51 The main reasons are that there were massive overcapacities during the apartheid era and indecision on 
the government's side regarding the privatisation of Eskom, which stopped Eskom from investing. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 94 Non-grid electrification programme 
Off-grid electrification is carried out by private-sector service providers (concessionaires) who have 
successfully tendered for concessions in designated areas. The non-grid electrification programme 
which expected to install 300 000 solar home systems (SHS) in 1998 has not managed to reach its 
objective. To date, only around 50 000 SHS have been installed and programmes are running in only 
a couple of provinces. Lack of political will and government support has thwarted the process. Some 
concessionaires have been providing maintenance for the systems, charging on a fee-for-service 
basis, while others have not provided this service. Non-payment of bills has also been a cause for 
concern in most concessionaires and lack of expected government capital subsidies has delayed 
much of the work. Decision making concerning the definition of a non-grid area has also caused 
delays and costs to the concessionaires. These difficulties have weakened the financial stability of 
the concessionaires and delayed the installation process. Renewable energy 
Poor policy implementation and lack of clear financial and legal regimes have constrained the 
development and introduction of new renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, modern 
bioenergy, etc. Only in 2009 has renewable energy officially been accepted as  " real "  power and the 
first national feed-in tariff scheme was established (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2009). 
South Africa has one of the best sun regimes in the world. Yet it has one of the lowest penetrations 
of solar water heaters (SWH). Experience with non-grid electrification through solar heating systems 
(SHS) has taught a lesson that solar panels are subject to theft and vandalism. Information 
campaigns and community development programmes help reduce vandalism. Poor perception of renewable energy 
Further, there is a perception that solar energy is not  " real "  energy; and SHSs are viewed as a 
temporary solution until the grid can be extended. Some municipalities have begun to install SWH 
in an effort to prevent load shedding. These efforts are seen to contribute positively to securing 
sufficient electricity on the grid and to change the perception that renewable energy is not  " real "  
electricity. Electricity losses 
Total electricity losses other than technical vary from between 10% and 15%, which includes system 
losses and theft (Seshotlho, 2009; Madzhie, 2009). Bypassing of meters is frequent by tapping at the 
supply points, and is generally well organised by groups of individuals  " assisting "  members of the 
local community, usually for a nominal fee. Law enforcement is applied, but illegal reconnections 
occur with minimum delay, often at the request of the households concerned. The reasons 
variously cited are inability to pay for supply, or the  " entitlement "  to a basic right enshrined in the 
Constitution. Cable theft is a national problem and there is no evidence to support that rural areas 
or poor areas are more subject to cable theft than other areas (Seshotlho, 2009). Eskom runs 
regular campaigns to report cable theft, and security patrols are used by both Eskom and 
municipalities to detect and avert theft. Despite the national power generation shortage, a number 
of municipalities use 24-hour street lighting as an early warning system of supply interruptions due 
to cable fault or theft. Prepaid electricity meters 
Prepaid electricity meters form part of the installation for all new connections under the INEP 
(Smuts, 2007). Initially, their introduction aimed at displacing  " conventional "  credit meters in order 
to reduce the administrative costs associated with monthly readings and billings. Further, credit 
meters were generally mounted on external walls of dwellings (in all residential areas), and 
suspicion was widespread that supply was accessed by unauthorised users. Hence, prepaid meters, Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 95 mounted inside dwellings, offered security while also affording the opportunity for consumers to 
monitor the consumption of the appliances they use. These meters also reduced the problem of 
non-payment. When selling prepaid electricity, the challenge of providing a convenient payment 
point close to every home can easily be underestimated. In most instances, the change from credit 
meters to prepaid meters was started with a focus on the installation of meters, but it was soon 
found that the system only started to operate smoothly once the focus included the sales channel 
as well. From an end-user's perspective, the real delivery process has much more to do with the 
logistics of moving vouchers (sometimes called  " tokens "  or  " PINs " ) from a computer where they are 
generated, to the user's home and moving the cash from the user's pockets to the utility's bank 
account. However, in the disadvantaged communities targeted by the INEP, few residents have 
bank accounts. They receive their salaries in cash (often daily or weekly) and when they purchase 
electricity they do frequent (once a week) small (about ZAR 30) transactions and pay in cash. In 
most municipalities, this group forms the bulk of the clients. Since either a mechanism (such as an 
unattended vending machine) or a person is needed to collect the cash during the transaction, this 
also forms the most challenging part of the community to sell to. However, as long as there is cell 
phone reception, cell phone vending has few boundaries and can reach informal settlements and 
newly developed suburbs with very little infrastructure. Implementation capacity 
A major challenge in South Africa is lack of human technical capacity and accurate information from 
the municipalities. The problem relates to all aspects of electricity markets: number of customers, 
monitoring of losses, collection of revenue and also information about the number of schools and 
their electrification status. This is a major reason why school electrification has not yet been 
completed. Some municipalities have weak institutions and have constrained capacities to provide 
basic information, thus failing to receive the necessary attention. In very special cases the DoE has 
allocated funds to build up capacity to manage the electricity supply and collection of revenues. 4.6 Rural electrification progress assessment and conclusion The South African national electrification programme has shown impressive results. The 
electrification rate has increased from 30% in 1993 to 73% in 2008 (Department of Energy, 2008a). 
Ambitious plans are in place to achieve full national access to modern energy, mainly through 
provision of connection to the national grid by 2014. Policies and funds are also allocated to ensure 
that areas or individual houses that cannot be connected to the grid can be serviced through 
different means of modern energy applications such as solar PV. The cost per connection in 2008 was on average around USD 1 000. The costs vary depending on 
population density and terrain but the average cost is kept within the planned budgets. The DoE is responsible for managing the INEP. The programme is carried out through grid 
connections by Eskom and those municipalities that have been licensed to roll out electrification, 
while non-grid electrification is provided by concessionaires. The DoE monitors the implementation through field checks and similar direct follow-ups and 
initiates corrective measures when results are not as planned. But there has been an 
implementation deficit at the DoE because of insufficient capacity and poor co-ordination between 
the non-grid component of INEP and the Renewable Energy Directorate, which is impeding the 
efficiency of the Department. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 96 There are several reasons why completion of the national electrification programme has had to be 
postponed from 2012 to 2014. Household electrification − the main component of the INEP − is under pressure. A major challenge 
in the household electrification programme is a severe housing backlog. It is estimated that around 
1.7 million households (half the estimated total of non-electrified households in May 2009) live in 
informal settlements. This means that their dwellings are built illegally and are not classified as 
 " houses "  because of their unsatisfactory construction. Although households in these informal 
settlements are entitled to equal access to electricity, it would not be cost-effective to electrify a 
shack dwelling that may be demolished at any time or destroyed in the next rainstorm. Hence, it is a 
key government priority that the issues around the 1.7 million households living in informal 
settlements be addressed first (by their respective municipal councils): either the areas must be 
formalised, or the inhabitants must be moved to other formalised human settlements before they 
can be included in the INEP. The DoE's policy guideline addresses this matter, and a plan and its 
budget are in place to enable connection before 2014 if the Department of Housing or the 
municipality arrange for people to live in formalised housing. A second challenge is the municipalities' capacity to deliver and oversee delivery of quality 
electrification. The DoE, which is also facing capacity deficits, seeks to monitor actual performance 
and to make sure that corrective measures are taken in case of under-or non-performance. Under-
or non-performance occurs in those licensed municipalities whose officials are inexperienced in the 
rolling-out of grid connections. Instead of contracting nationally well-established service providers 
for the physical implementation of electrification schemes, municipality officials may succumb to 
pressure by the local communities to support local contractors. The combination of local pressure, 
weak technical know-how, and stretched municipal capacity in general leads to delays in the 
implementation or in failure to meet quality criteria. Corrective measures are then required before 
the DoE releases more funds. In order to accelerate implementation and quality delivery, the DoE 
has established guidelines for all the stages of the electrification programme and occasionally 
provides one-off capacity building support to weaker municipalities. In the case of non-grid 
electrification, non-acceptance of renewable energy systems as a solution for the provision of 
electricity is slowing down the electrification process. Electrification of registered clinics has been successfully completed ahead of schedule. 
Electrification of schools, however, is facing problems largely stemming from lack of information 
about the number of schools and their electrification status. Some municipalities fail to report the 
number of schools in their area or fail to provide accurate information on whether the schools are 
electrified or not. It is clear that this poses a major constraint for the entities in charge of the 
electrification of the as-yet un-electrified schools. The lack of proper information is indeed one of 
the many capacity shortfalls at municipality level. Other capacity gaps are improper recording of 
sales of electricity leading to sub-optimal income streams, and sub-optimal network maintenance. 
Both the DoE and the National Energy Regulator (NERSA) recognise these challenges and, in very 
special cases, the DoE has allocated funds to build up capacity to manage electricity supply and the 
collection of revenues. An important by-product of the INEP is the adoption of standard methodologies, coupled with a 
greater awareness of technology options. The standards were established after broad stakeholder 
consultations, including electricity utility practitioners, equipment suppliers, regulatory bodies and 
end-user representatives. These standards are now widely used not only in South Africa but also 
throughout the Southern African region. The INEP provides incentives for a range of new 
technologies, including planning tools, to meet a variety of site-specific conditions during the roll-
out of the programme. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 97 In the case of South Africa's electrification programme the policy of  " inventing "  technologies 
specifically for the poor has not been successful. If solar water heating had been used by the richer 
households and in the cities, then the technology could have been extended to the poorer 
communities. The rapid flow of information has determined electrification preferences of the 
people. Cities have been electrified through grid extension. Renewable energy is publicly called 
 " rural energy " , and this has led to the negative image attached to all renewable energy applications. 
The implementation of the DoE programme for renewable energy has been slow and the share of 
renewable energy in power supply is still insignificant. In 2008, Eskom launched a programme to 
subsidise solar water heating (SWH), but the subsidy level was too low and required massive 
administration and control systems so that the programme has had little success. Since 2008 some 
municipalities have introduced SWH as a way of avoiding load shedding by Eskom. In early 2009 
South Africa announced a feed-in tariff for grid-connected renewable energy. Finally, the South African example confirms what some documentation has revealed: that rural 
electrification in itself does not lead to economic growth or business development. Rural 
electrification does not generate local jobs – except those jobs created for the implementation of 
the electrification schemes. This was confirmed by the Socio-Economic Surveys undertaken by the 
DoE. Rural economic development needs more than just household electrification. Constraints on 
the availability of energy and its affordability affect economic development, especially in rural 
areas. Modern energy services promote economic development by enhancing the productivity of 
labour and capital. There are important development benefits to be gained from expanding access 
to modern energy services. In order to achieve rural development objectives, however, there needs 
to be an integrated approach to the provision of modern energy services and improved information 
and telecommunication, education, health and transport services. The long-term effect on the 
population of smoke-free kitchens, and the benefits of being able to read in the evening, watch 
television, or charge a cell-phone will be interesting to follow. In the case of South Africa, the 
national electrification plan is an integral part of a broader national development plan. Other 
initiatives are in place to promote growth and job creation, such as through the development of 
tourism. Electrifying a new area will open many doors to take advantage of the parallel government 
initiatives to stimulate economic growth. These initiatives will have more success if they include 
energy access in their overall objectives. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 99 5 Conclusions and recommendations The detailed country profiles for Brazil, China, India and South Africa shed light on the main issues 
that arose as their governments shaped and implemented their rural electrification strategies. 
These profiles have also served to show successful examples in overcoming major challenges. The keys to the successful setting-up and implementation of rural electrification policies are drawn 
from these profiles. Their aim is to encourage policy makers in developing countries who strive to 
attain the same goals to take time during the electrification process to consider collaborating with 
one another and within the various IEA energy technology Implementing Agreements or Working 
Parties. 5.1 Preconditions to successful rural electrification measures 5.1.1 Sound statistical data to map out the populations' geographical 
distribution and electrification status A prerequisite to any rural electrification policy is the collection of sound statistical data to map out 
the electrification needs of a country. The shaping of the policy (including the choice of technologies 
for electrification and deadlines) will greatly depend on the geographical distribution of the rural 
population and of the existing grid, the density of this population and its level of electrification. 
First, lack of information about the location of populations without access to electricity will cause 
serious delays in the implementation of an electrification policy not to mention the risk of 
overlooking small-scale infrastructures (isolated schools, health centres, etc.) or remote 
communities unable to inform about their needs because of their geographical distance. Secondly, 
the choice of the suitable technology for electrification can only be done efficiently when targets 
are clearly defined, such as the expected use of electricity and particularly its productive use 5.1.2 Sustained government support and long-term commitment of 
funds All rural electrification policies detailed in this Information Paper have implied the full involvement 
of the four countries' central and local governments. The government support is essential to the 
development of a successful rural electrification plan. India is a good example. In 2001, the central 
government launched the  " Power for All by 2012 "  initiative, with all the electricity laws that 
followed, paving the way for the effective implementation of rural electrification efforts in India, 
after these efforts had slacked because of the State Electricity Boards' financial problems. The 
government of India, through laws and reforms which have shaped the country's institutional and 
legal framework, and through the establishment of dedicated rural electrification institutions, has 
opted for long-term planning, with centrally determined objectives and target years. Without firm 
implementation policies and goals that can be enforced through legislation, the electrification 
process will fall through. Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 100 A successful rural electrification programme needs long-term strategic planning and financial 
resources for its implementation and for long-term maintenance and repairs. Before 2007, lack of 
sufficient funds was the main reason for the slow implementation of rural electrification in India 
during the 10 th Five-Year Plan. Moreover, if secure and dedicated funds are not available for the 
longer term once the project is implemented, there will be financial losses and perhaps the de-
electrification of previously newly electrified villages. This has occurred in China, where  " system 
integrators "  were responsible for the maintenance of their stand-alone systems for only three years 
after installation. This resulted in some systems being abandoned because of lack of ownership and 
funds for repairs and maintenance. Such funds need to be included in the electrification plan and 
made available over a longer period, say 5 to 10 years after installation. Whether these funds are 
provided through subsidies or through loans, governments should aim at the maximum level of 
certainty concerning the long-term commitment. Available funds should be  " ring-fenced "  so that 
there is no risk of having them misdirected to other government-led activities (GNESD, 2006). 5.1.3 Dedicated institutional structures and independence from political 
agendas The creation of transparent and dedicated institutions such as rural electrification agencies (or co-
ordinating agencies) and/or a rural electrification fund, largely autonomous and responsible for 
implementing the country's rural electrification strategy, is strongly recommended (Barnes & Foley, 
2004). Such agencies ensure that funds are allocated directly to rural electrification and not 
reallocated over time to various national priorities. Their apolitical nature should guarantee the 
durability of efforts independently of any other political or social goal. They should also develop the 
necessary standards and guidelines for the implementation of rural electrification programmes. For 
example, the establishment of the Rural Electrification Board in India has proven to be an effective 
means of furthering electrification efforts independently of political pressures. In the same vein, it is also essential that rural electrification efforts remain independent from 
politicians' personal agendas. Not uncommon are cases where politicians, eager to gain their 
constituents' support for a renewed mandate, interfere with the electrification process. This has 
occurred in Bangladesh, where one village, and no other, was provided with access to electricity for 
the satisfaction of politicians' agendas. The government of Bangladesh has also pledged to 
construct new lines servicing areas in the constituencies (whose selection was not justified on 
commercial grounds) of all Members of Parliament (Taniguchi & Kaneko, 2009). The consequences 
of such administrative corruption are well known, and hinder the development process. When 
political pressures interfere with the distribution planning, they cause financial difficulties to the 
utilities or distribution companies if they are forced to operate in a non-commercial manner or are 
unable to cut the power supply to non-paying customers. For this reason, rural electrification 
efforts should follow a predetermined, inviolable plan that involves a structured institutional 
setting. An apolitical monitoring of how rural electrification progresses is recommended. This task 
can be undertaken by independent institutions created or designated for that purpose. 5.1.4 Establishment of a strong market infrastructure to attract private 
investors Participation of the private sector is important when electrifying remote villages, particularly with 
stand-alone systems. But for the private sector to participate, governments must ensure the Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 101 existence of a secure market infrastructure, as all electrification projects need to be viable in order 
to be sustainable. And as the private sector's viability depends on profits, it will participate in the 
electrification process only if money flows easily from customer to supplier. As a market in 
transition, China has tried to encourage private-sector involvement in the electrification process of 
rural areas through stand-alone systems (although the boundary between privately owned and 
publicly owned enterprises is not always clear). In cases where revenues are too insecure to attract 
the private sector, governments could grant subsidies to enterprises that wish to engage in rural 
electrification programmes. Such policy however has had mixed results (Martinot et al., 2000) and 
should only be a transitional incentive to encourage private engagement. 5.1.5 Related laws and/or regulations to be carried out alongside the 
electrification process First, measures including complementary economic development programmes, alongside the 
provision of electricity in rural areas, should be introduced to foster business. These measures 
should ensure that rural areas are governed by good rural markets and have access to credit 
(Barnes, 2007). Without such complementary measures, business development initiated by the 
electrification process is likely to slacken. Joint efforts with other ministries or development 
agencies are therefore recommended to enhance the economic benefits of electrification, as Brazil 
has done. Through its Territories of Citizenship Programme, a joint ministerial effort to promote 
economic growth through territorial development, Brazil is in fact striving to improve the quality of 
life of households in rural or poorer regions. Secondly, in parallel to the electrification process, the implementation of energy efficiency policies 
or measures is recommended. Energy efficiency measures such as the use of energy-saving 
appliances, simple demand-side management measures, or energy conservation in buildings, 
significantly reduce electricity demand. The Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for example 
has taken many energy conservation measures to control electricity consumption in parallel to the 
country's electrification efforts. But this was not the case in South Africa, where energy efficiency 
measures were launched only after the 2008 blackouts, during which it appeared that South Africa 
could not meet its growing demand for electricity. In fact, during South Africa's electrification 
efforts, energy efficiency measures were largely overlooked. The government, aware of the need 
for energy efficiency measures, is now working to ensure that all houses comply with best-practice 
energy efficiency standards. This late compliance, however, has had costs. 5.1.6 Electricity affordability The issue of electricity affordability is recurrent in the context of rural electrification, as the target 
groups are usually the rural poor. This said, rural households are usually very willing to pay for 
access to energy services. When they do not have access to electricity, they often contribute much 
of their time and revenue to buying or collecting energy sources for their day-to-day needs (Barnes, 
2007). The first hurdle is the connection. Initial payments for the connection are often high for the rural 
poor. They may have enough to pay for the regular use of electricity but may not be able to afford 
the connection fees. In such cases, any subsidised electricity is useless for them. When connections 
are free of charge for the very poor, as in South Africa and India, this first problem is tackled. If Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 102 funds are not available, spreading the connection costs over several years will enable larger 
numbers of customers to be wired, while ensuring the costs are recovered over time by the utility. The second hurdle is setting the tariff. There is no made-to-measure tariff and there is no good way 
to set tariffs. Three points however need to be raised. First, there is a widespread belief that, to 
benefit the rural poor, electricity needs to be sold at a very low price; facts often prove the 
contrary. In reality, richer communities will benefit more than the poorer ones since they can afford 
to buy electric appliances, which the very poor cannot. In addition, subsidies should be designed in 
such a way that only the poorest segments of society benefit from them, and not the better-off 
communities. Secondly, if the  " natural "  price is charged, the electricity supplier will be able to 
effectively and sustainably supply electricity while making a profit that will ensure the sustainability 
of the electrification process (Barnes & Foley, 2004). Thirdly, rural households are often able to pay 
for their electricity consumption. 
Involving these communities in the tariff-setting process will secure better and more adequate tariff 
systems. 5.1.7 Effective metering, billing and payment recovery The effective recovery of customer payments allows electricity companies to supply reliable and 
sustainable power. Lack of payment for electricity use not only weakens the financial stability of the 
electricity provider (World Bank, 2000), but also discourages investors to join in on the rural 
electrification efforts because of uncertain revenues. Adequate metering, billing and payment 
recovery are fundamental to a sustainable electrification system. When meters do not function 
correctly, are not properly read or billing is incorrect, then the customer's actual consumption will 
not be paid for. Adding to these technical or organisational challenges is petty corruption at the 
interface with customers, including bribes paid to or requested by meter readers. To tackle these 
issues, measures such as the creation of franchisees (India), the part-time recruitment of farmers 
for meter reading (China), or the use of prepaid meters (South Africa and Brazil) as well as stricter 
management rules (such as random controls) all help to improve the recovery of customer 
payment, a necessary condition for successful rural electrification efforts. 5.1.8 Full involvement of the rural community throughout the decision-
making process Involving rural communities in the decision-making process has substantially contributed to the 
effectiveness of these electrification programmes. One tends to believe that rural electrification is 
the outcome of the sole efforts of governments (central, local or regional) and/or of international 
development or funding agencies. But the involvement of rural communities in the process, 
particularly their participation in decision-making committees, has added value to the planning 
process and given the communities a sense of ownership of the process. Because of their intrinsic 
characteristics, rural community workers have invaluable knowledge of their region's consumption 
patterns, have authority to educate consumers in how to use electricity, can support the utilities in 
encouraging customers to connect and in training in the use of energy efficiency measures, etc. 
Both India and Brazil have taken this into account. India, acknowledging that most of the burden of 
doing without electricity falls on women, has arranged for women to be represented in District 
Committees, thereby helping in the co-ordination and control of electrification extensions within 
their district. These committees also check the quality of power and consumer satisfaction, and Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 103 promote energy efficiency measures. According to the government of India's statement, the 
 " participation of women in meeting energy needs, especially electricity, is essential for effective, 
efficient and sustainable implementation of rural electrification programs. "  Similarly, Brazil through 
its Luz para Todos programme has ensured the involvement of rural communities in Management 
Committees which work to prioritise activities within the electrification process. 5.2 Stand-alone systems: conditions for successful rural 
electrification efforts Different issues need to be addressed to secure the sustainability of the electrification process 
through stand-alone systems. 5.2.1 Locally produced and resource-specific technologies for 
electrification If grid extension is not chosen to electrify a targeted region, then the choice of a stand-alone system 
− whether small, mini or micro-hydro, PV systems, wind energy, hybrid systems, diesel generators, etc. − will depend on many factors. No single technology is to be recommended. Aspects such as 
the geographical dispersion of the local population, the community's estimated electricity needs 
and ability to pay, availability of local resources, all factor into the decision-making process. Also, 
long-term investment from the private sector depends on the climate profile of the territory; the 
private sector will invest in the safest places as regards climate impacts and will favour climate 
change-resilient regions. Therefore, decisions will be region-specific, resource-specific, technology-
specific (hydro plants in water-rich regions and PV systems in sunny regions, as is the case in China). 
Rural electrification programmes will also favour locally-manufactured technologies to reduce 
transportation or import costs. 5.2.2 Management and maintenance require adequate training, 
guaranteed assistance structures and customer-supply chains Once systems are installed and the electricity service is provided, it is important to make sure that 
the rural communities – or the actors responsible – are sufficiently skilled to operate and maintain 
the systems. Lack of any basic skills (including the ability to read the maintenance handbook) may 
lead to the system being abandoned in case of malfunctioning. It is therefore essential that 
adequate training be provided to the maintenance actor while the stand-alone system is being 
installed. Moreover, accessible guaranteed assistance structures in support of maintenance and repair should 
be established at the outset of the electrification effort. It is recommended that the target 
communities − or the responsible maintenance actors − be informed by the installer of how to 
contact assistance structures. Without such assistance structures and guidelines, there is a risk that 
the system be abandoned in the longer run. Finally, just as clear assistance structures are a necessary condition for the sustainability of stand-
alone systems in remote areas, it is recommended that maintenance actors should be given clear Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 104 guidelines as to where and how to obtain spare parts and maintenance materials. In addition, 
governments should ensure that suppliers are committed to provide adequate after-sales services. 5.2.3 Sufficient long-term financing to ensure system maintenance Financial provision should be made at the outset for the long-term maintenance of the systems. To 
ensure projects' sustainability, financial support (whether through loans, subsidies or other) should 
be provided for the installation of stand-alone systems and long-term (5 to 10 year) annual 
contracts for the maintenance and upgrading of the systems so as to prevent any system failure. In 
addition, electricity supply can be partially directed towards the development of productive 
activities to generate funds and so to cover the costs incurred by power supply, operation and 
maintenance, particularly once the annual maintenance contract has come to an end. 5.2.4 Dealing with the misconception that stand-alone systems provide 
 " second-class "  electricity Electricity supplied through stand-alone systems is not to be regarded as  " second class "  provision, a 
problem that is currently observed in South Africa. Appropriate information dissemination and good 
performance of the stand-alone systems will do away with such issues as lack of ownership, and 
long-term deterioration or abandonment of the systems will be avoided. Decision makers are to rely 
on the members of the rural communities sitting in the various supporting committees to redress 
this misconception within their communities. 5.3 Grid extension: conditions for successful rural 
electrification efforts 5.3.1 Reducing transmission and distribution losses Long transmission lines (when extending the grid to rural areas) are at risk of high transmission and 
distribution (T&D) losses. Line quality and the quality of transformers will also impact the efficiency 
of T&D. Regular maintenance and upgrading of power lines and transformers will significantly 
reduce such losses. 5.3.2 Reducing losses from electricity theft Electricity theft occurs through many different channels. Meters are tampered, or meter readers 
are corrupt, billing is inadequate or non-existent, revenue is not collected or is not passed on to the 
utility. Electricity theft can also take the form of illegal hookings (a small metal hook is slung to an 
overhead power cable and then linked to a house through a cable) which are difficult to prevent or 
control. All these losses add up and electricity companies are seriously weakened when their service 
is not paid for. Although theft takes place just as often in urban centres as in rural areas, measures 
to control and reduce electricity theft are more difficult to apply in rural areas. The introduction of 
India's 2003 Electricity Act, a law in which theft is considered a criminal offence heavily penalised, 
dissuades electricity thieves. Other means are the installation of high-voltage distribution systems Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 105 (HVDS) which are difficult to hook cables on to. In the case of stand-alone systems in China, PV 
modules have in some instances been welded to the main structure to create additional hindrances 
for potential thieves. In South Africa, Eskom, the national power utility, runs regular campaigns for 
cable theft to be reported, and security patrols are used by both Eskom and municipalities to detect 
and avert theft. 5.3.3 Use of low-cost technologies Through the use of low-cost technologies such as single-wire earth return (SWER) as currently used 
in South Africa for the electrification of rural households, costs of electrification remain controlled. 
Other standards that allow for cost-effectiveness are the adequate location of transformers, which 
could depend on current assessed and future electricity demand (GNESD, 2006). Such standards will 
contribute to moderate electricity prices. 5.4 Three rural electrification boosters 5.4.1 Social fairness can be one of the initial driving motivators in the 
first stages of electrification A 2009 case study of Bangladesh showed that the total income gain following electrification 
reached up to 30% (Khandker et al., 2009). But this was not the result of directing electricity to 
productive end-uses. In fact electricity provision led to a significant improvement in total study time 
for children in rural households coupled with an increase in the number of completed school years. 
The income generated was shown to be sustainable over as long as 8 years. These encouraging 
results are real incentives to target household electrification as a means of attaining social equity 
which in the long run will lead to economic growth. Indeed, considering only the productive end-
uses of electricity as useful for development is obscuring the actual proven development capacity of 
health services and education (Cabraal et al., 2005). This also may slow down the electrification 
efforts. For this reason, social equity can be one of the initial driving motivators of electrification. 5.4.2 Minimising trial and error through benchmarking and exchange 
with other countries Though not all emerging economies face the same challenges when working to expand rural 
electrification, many of the challenges are similar. Whether they live in Brazil, South Africa, China or 
India, or any developing country, rural populations have the same main characteristics, namely they 
are often dispersed, difficult to reach, have low electricity consumption needs and low capacity to 
pay. In addition, countries face the same dual choice between grid extension and stand-alone 
systems (whatever their size or energy source) and also the same questions regarding the means for 
financing their electrification efforts (subsidies, loans, grants or other). Often institutional structures 
or regulatory frameworks need to be introduced or strengthened to encourage investors or the 
private sector to participate in the electrification scheme. Given the similarity of problems, it is 
recommended that countries with active rural electrification policies benchmark their activities with 
those of other countries at similar or more advanced stages. Such information exchange between Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 Page | 106 countries with similar objectives should take place before and during the implementation of rural 
electrification policies 52 to minimise trial and error. 5.4.3 Co-operation within IEA Implementing Agreements for exchange 
on technologies and support on policy formulation Finally, co-operation within the framework of the IEA Implementing Agreements (IA) will provide 
support to countries seeking to develop their electrification policies. IAs are collaborative 
programmes whose members 53 participate in some or all of the following activities: research 
projects, programmes for information exchange, policy analysis, technology assessments, feasibility 
studies, environmental impact studies, market analysis, and more. Benefits of collaborating with 
other countries within these programmes are  " reduced cost and less duplication of work, greater 
project scale, information sharing and networking, linkage between IEA member countries and non-
member countries of the IEA, linkage between research and industry, accelerated development and 
deployment, harmonised technical standards, strengthened national RD&D capabilities "  (IEA, 2007). 
Members of these collaborative programmes are able to influence the direction of the work of the 
IAs. It is thus recommended that countries wishing to engage in rural electrification efforts consider 
participating in these IAs to learn from other countries and share their experience with other 
country participants. 54 A list of the relevant IAs can be found in the proceedings of the 2008 
workshop on  " IEA Sustainable Rural Energisation in Major Emerging Economies "  
http://www.iea.org/textbase/work/workshopdetail.asp?WS_ID=379. 52 Such South-South collaboration is already successfully taking place within the Club-ER (http://www.club-
er.org/), a club for agencies and national structures in charge of rural electrification comprising 20 member 
countries, 18 of which are French-speaking African countries. 
53 Usually IA members are representatives of countries or independent institutions according to the prevailing 
contractual agreement between IA members. Any country may join an IA, not just IEA member countries. 
54 More information on all the IAs and how to join these programmes can be found at
