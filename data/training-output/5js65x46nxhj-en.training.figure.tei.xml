            <figDesc>Since July 2014, China&apos;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has revealed lists<lb/> of steelmakers that should remove obsolete capacities. 16 Also, provincial governments were requested to<lb/> submit, by 30 June 2015, their targets for dismantling outdated and excess capacities in 2015 and during<lb/> the 13 th five-year (2016-2020) economic development plan (MIIT, 2014). 17<lb/> Some important coastal steelworks have been put into operation over the last few years in China:<lb/> Anshan Iron &amp; Steel commissioned its 6.5 million tpy Bayuquan works in Liaoning Province in 2008,<lb/> while Shougang Jingtang United Iron &amp; Steel completed its 9.7 million tpy works in Hebei Province in<lb/> 2010. Many projects have been announced in resource-rich inland regions. For example, Xinjiang&apos;s rich<lb/> raw material resources have attracted many steelmakers to invest in new capacities in the region. 18<lb/> Although the BOF production process will remain the dominant production process in China in the years to<lb/> come, the EAF share may increase gradually along with increasing availability of domestic scrap, but the<lb/> process is likely to take some time (Japan Metal Bulletin, 2014). 19 Despite a slowdown in China&apos;s capacity<lb/> growth rate compared to previous years, large steelworks that focus on the production of flat products are<lb/> being built in the country, namely:<lb/> Baosteel could commission the first of two 5 050 m 3 blast furnaces at its Zhanjiang steelworks<lb/> (Guangdong Province) by the end of September in 2015. The entire steelworks is expected to be<lb/> commissioned by June 2016. 20 On 26 September 2014, Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel Group set up the<lb/> Fangchenggang Steel Company Limited that would be responsible for the operations management of its<lb/> steel project in Guangxi Province. The new integrated steelworks is designed to be able to produce<lb/> 9.2 million tpy of crude steel with two 5 200 m 3 blast furnaces. Shandong Iron and Steel Group plans to<lb/> launch its 8.5 million tpy Rizhao steelworks in Shandong Province by the end of 2016, with two 5 100 m 3<lb/> blast furnaces.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Recent reports suggest that China&apos;s actual crude steelmaking capacity could be higher than estimated. A<lb/> Platts (2014a) report notes that Chinese capacity reached 1.11 billion tpy in 2013 and will increase to<lb/> 1.14 billion tpy in 2014, according to China Iron and Steel Association.<lb/> 5.<lb/> For example, Isdemir blew-in its No. 4 blast furnace with an inner volume of 2 500 m 3 in 2011. In 2013,<lb/> scrap imports decreased by 12.0% to 19.7 mmt compared with 2012, while iron ore imports were up by 3.5%<lb/> to 8.1 mmt, according to data from the World Steel Association.<lb/> 6.<lb/> According to the World Steel Association data, the share of BOF in the CIS region has grown to 67.7% in<lb/> 2013, i.e. by 10 percentage points from its level 10 years earlier.<lb/> 7.<lb/> The Russian steel industry is aiming to replace all of its OHF facilities by 2015 (Russian Steel Consortium,<lb/> 2013). Ukraine expects to complete the replacement of its OHF technology by 2018 (SE UEX, 2014).<lb/> 8.<lb/> These projects do not seem however to be progressing as expected.</figDesc>
