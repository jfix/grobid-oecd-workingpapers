Within global value chains and international production networks, not only are final goods <lb/>traded internationally, but intermediate goods (parts and components) and, in recent years, services also <lb/>increasingly are. This trend significantly alters the economic relations between countries and increasingly <lb/>casts doubt on empirical indicators such as trade and FDI that are traditionally used to measure <lb/>globalisation. Input-output tables may provide much finer detail in describing current globalisation as they <lb/>offer information on the use of goods instead of the rather arbitrary classification schemes that divide <lb/>goods into intermediate and other categories. Moreover, input-output tables also incorporate information <lb/>on the use of services, enabling measurement of the increasing offshoring of service activities in today&apos;s <lb/>business activities. Based on the OECD Input-Output Database, which includes harmonised tables for 38 <lb/>countries (of which 10 emerging non-OECD economies), this paper brings together empirical evidence on <lb/>the growing importance of global value chains and the increasing interdependence between countries. <lb/>Input-output indicators are presented for individual countries and individual industries, aiming to <lb/>demonstrate the changing characteristics of current globalisation. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/>4 <lb/>TABLE OF CONTENTS <lb/>Introduction ................................................................................................................................................. 5 <lb/>The OECD Input-Output Database ............................................................................................................. 7 <lb/>Indicators on global linkages ..................................................................................................................... 12 <lb/>Indicators on offshoring ............................................................................................................................ 15 <lb/>Calculating higher-order effects: embodied imports and the foreign content of exports .......................... 22 <lb/>Employment effects – job embodiment of trade ....................................................................................... 26 <lb/>Conclusions and future directions for research ......................................................................................... 29 <lb/>REFERENCES ............................................................................................................................................. 30 <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></front>

			<body>THE MEASUREMENT OF GLOBALISATION USING INTERNATIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT <lb/>TABLES <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Input-output analysis has received renewed attention in recent years as input-output (I-O) tables are <lb/>increasingly used in the empirical analyses of different topics, such as material flows, environmental <lb/>issues, sustainable development, embodied technology, etc. This is partly due to the improved availability <lb/>and quality of national input-output tables as well as modern IT capabilities that allow for more complex <lb/>analyses to be undertaken. An area where input-output information has been used less is globalisation, <lb/>largely due to the fact that published input-output tables do not have the same sector classification and <lb/>price basis definitions, and therefore often lack international comparability. <lb/>Globalisation is high on policy and research agendas in many countries as the pace and scale of <lb/>today&apos;s globalisation process is without precedent. Growth in world exports and imports has been <lb/>accelerating since the 1980s, far exceeding the growth in world GDP. Since the second half of the 1990s, <lb/>globalisation has been particularly boosted by the strong increase in foreign direct investment (FDI). <lb/>Moreover, current economic integration is no longer restricted to the Triad – the United States, Europe and <lb/>Japan – but now extends to new large global players like Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs). <lb/>Furthermore, current globalisation displays some distinctive features (OECD, 2007a; Grossman and <lb/>Rossi-Hanberg, 2006; Baldwin, 2006) as production processes are increasingly fragmented geographically, <lb/>resulting in the emergence of global value chains. Information and communication technologies (ICT) <lb/>have made it possible to &quot; slice up &quot; the traditional value chain (Porter, 1985) and activities that previously <lb/>had to be carried out in the same location in order to reduce costs (Box 1). Instead of total industries and <lb/>their complete value chains, particular fragments of production are now increasingly clustering locally. <lb/>Important restructuring has taken place within companies and industries, resulting in the outsourcing, <lb/>offshoring and relocation activities. Final products and, increasingly, also production of intermediates are <lb/>being offshored within these global value chains, giving rise to increased trade through exports and <lb/>imports. Multinational firms play a prominent role in these global value and supply chains as they have a <lb/>global reach that allows them to co-ordinate production and distribution across many countries and shift <lb/>their activities according to changing demand and cost conditions. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. The Value Chain <lb/>The value chain is a systematic approach to the analysis of the competitive advantage of companies, <lb/>developed by M.E. Porter in his book Competitive Advantage (1985). The chain consists of a series of <lb/>activities that create and build value, distinguishing between &quot; primary activities &quot; and &quot; support activities &quot; . <lb/>Primary activities <lb/>Inbound logistics: reception and storage of goods. <lb/>Operations: manufacturing and assembly of goods. <lb/>Outbound logistics: distribution to wholesalers, retailers or the final consumer. <lb/>Marketing and sales: marketing, communications and promotion. <lb/>Service: installation, customer service, handling complaints, training, etc. <lb/>Support activities <lb/>Procurement: purchasing of goods, services and materials. <lb/>Technology development: production technology, lean manufacturing, <lb/>customer relationship management (CRM), etc. <lb/>Human resource management: recruitment, training and development, remuneration. <lb/>Firm infrastructure: planning and control mechanisms (e.g. accounting). <lb/>Another key characteristic of current globalisation is that it increasingly extends to FDI and trade in <lb/>services. Many service activities are becoming increasingly internationalised, especially as ICT enables <lb/>services to be produced irrespective of location. Improvements in technology, standardisation, <lb/>infrastructure growth and decreasing data transmission costs have all facilitated the sourcing of services <lb/>from abroad. Rapid advances in ICT have also increased the tradability of many service activities and <lb/>created new kinds of tradable services. In particular, &quot; knowledge work &quot; such as database and information <lb/>processing services and research and consultancy services can easily be carried out via the Internet and <lb/>through tele-and video-conferencing. Activities such as call centres have also begun to be offshored. <lb/>As global value chains and the related offshoring may have important impacts on national economies <lb/>and employment, more accurate empirical measures of globalisation have been called for. However, the <lb/>new characteristics of globalisation make empirical measurement of current globalisation a difficult and <lb/>challenging exercise. While trade and FDI data have traditionally been used to measure globalisation, both <lb/>are too broad to measure the size of global value chains and the extent of offshoring. Due to the emergence <lb/>of global value chains, trade has increased not only in finished goods and services but also, and especially, <lb/>in intermediates such as primary goods, parts and components, and semi-finished goods. Exports of final <lb/>goods are no longer an appropriate indicator of the (international) competitiveness of countries, as <lb/></body>

			<body>following the emergence of global value chains, final goods increasingly include a large proportion of <lb/>intermediate goods that have been imported into the country. <lb/>Data on trade in intermediate goods and services may provide a more accurate indication, but such <lb/>data are not readily available. Based on the broad economic categories developed by the United Nations, <lb/>54% of world manufacturing imports in 2003 could be classified as imports of intermediate goods. <lb/>However, the drawback with these kinds of classifications is that they are based on some (arbitrary) <lb/>assessment of which goods and products can be considered intermediate, and which ones as final. The <lb/>emergence of global value chains makes this distinction even less clear, as close-to-final products are often <lb/>further processed in subsequent production and distribution stages within companies. The measurement <lb/>problem is even greater for the offshoring of services, as data on trade in services are far less detailed than <lb/>on trade in goods, while trade data do not typically identify if services are destined for final consumption <lb/>or intermediate use. <lb/>In general, official data on employment, trade and FDI typically provide some insight into offshoring, <lb/>but do not provide a complete picture (US Government Accountability Office, 2004). Firm-level data <lb/>(often collected through surveys) may provide the most complete information on the globalisation of value <lb/>chains and offshoring, but firms are often reluctant to furnish details on their outsourcing/offshoring and – <lb/>especially – relocation decisions given the sensitivity surrounding these phenomena. Input-output tables, <lb/>which are typically available for all industries albeit at an aggregated level, offer complementary insights <lb/>into the globalisation of value chains as they provide information on the value of intermediate goods and <lb/>services that have been imported from outside the country. A key advantage of I-O tables is that they <lb/>classify goods according to their use (as an input into another sector&apos;s production or as final demand) <lb/>instead of classification schemes that divide goods into intermediate and other categories based on their <lb/>descriptive characteristics. Another key advantage of I-O tables is that they also include information on <lb/>(domestic and international) inputs of/in services sectors, so that the fast-growing offshoring of services <lb/>activities can be monitored. <lb/>This paper brings together empirical evidence on the growing importance of global value chains and <lb/>the increasing interdependence between countries using the OECD Input-Output Tables Database. <lb/>Input-output indicators are presented for individual countries and individual industries, with the aim to <lb/>demonstrate the changing characteristics of current globalisation. <lb/>The OECD Input-Output Database <lb/>Coverage – country and time <lb/>Approximately every five years, the OECD produces estimated harmonised input-output tables. The <lb/>first edition of the OECD Input-Output Database dates back to 1995 and covered 10 OECD countries, <lb/>spanning the period from the early 1970s to 1990. A first update of this database (2002 edition) increased <lb/>the country coverage to 18 OECD and two non-OECD countries (China and Brazil). The 2006 edition 1 has <lb/>expanded coverage to 38 (28 OECD countries and 10 non-OECD economies), further strengthening the <lb/>database&apos;s ability to tackle global questions. The effects of globalisation and increased foreign outsourcing <lb/>of manufacturing goods and services, for example, cannot be properly analysed if some emerging <lb/>non-member economies such as India, Indonesia and Russia are not included within the dataset. <lb/>Table 1 gives an overview of the countries that have been included in the different versions of the OECD <lb/>I-O Database. For this paper, the most recent edition has been used, with data for 1995 and 2000 available <lb/>for certain countries. <lb/>1. <lb/>Including additional tables compiled after the first dissemination package. <lb/></body>

			<body>Representativeness of database coverage – GDP and population <lb/>The high representativeness of the OECD I-O database is clearly illustrated by its growing coverage <lb/>over time (Figure 1).

			<body>Price basis <lb/>In line with the 1993 System of National Accounts, the OECD Input-Output Database shows <lb/>transactions, wherever possible, in industry-by-industry symmetric tables at basic prices. Eurostat member <lb/>countries follow the basic price valuation system in producing the symmetric input-output tables. Some <lb/>countries have not provided the tables at basic price in the published input-output tables. The basic price <lb/>tables in the OECD format are submitted by the following economies 2 : Japan, Korea, India, Indonesia and <lb/>Chinese Taipei. Ideally, for many applications, temporal comparisons of economic indicators should be <lb/>made using constant price figures. However, constant price tables are only available in a very limited <lb/>number of countries and so the 2006 edition, like the 2002 edition, reflects current price tables only. <lb/>Format <lb/>The 2006 edition of the input-output tables follows the format of earlier editions.

			<body>Indicators on global linkages <lb/>Traditional indicators using I-O information to measure the international orientation and dependency <lb/>of countries are the import penetration and the export share of countries. While the former measures to <lb/>what extent the total demand for goods and services in a country is served by imports, the latter shows the <lb/>percentage of the total production of goods and services that is exported: <lb/>total imports of goods and services (M k ) <lb/>Import penetration <lb/>= <lb/>----------------------------------------------------<lb/>total demand for goods and services (D k ) <lb/>total exports of goods and services (X k ) <lb/>Export share <lb/>= <lb/>---------------------------------------------------<lb/>total supply for goods and services (O k ) <lb/>Figure 2 indicates that the import penetration has increased in 32 out of the 34 countries (for four <lb/>countries only a one-year observation is available) and the export shares increased in 28 countries, <lb/>reflecting the increase in foreign dependency of OECD economies and major non-OECD countries in the <lb/>late 1990s. A typical observation that comes out of these international comparisons is that smaller <lb/>countries have a larger international orientation than larger countries. Smaller countries such as Belgium, <lb/>Hungary, Ireland, the Slovak Republic and Singapore are clear examples of this, while their higher <lb/>international dependency is also partially due to the large presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in <lb/>these countries. <lb/>Affiliates under foreign control are engaged not only in serving the local market in the host country, <lb/>but have become essential links in global value chains as they serve other (neighbouring) markets and <lb/>produce inputs for other affiliates in the multinational network. Data for US multinational firms show that <lb/>65% of the total output of US firms&apos; foreign affiliates goes to the local market, while 11% goes to the <lb/>United States and another 24% goes to third countries. In consequence, export and import intensities of <lb/>foreign affiliates are in many cases higher than those of the average domestic firm, especially in <lb/>manufacturing (OECD, 2007a). In Ireland, for example, over 90% of the manufacturing output of foreign <lb/>affiliates is exported, and in Austria and Finland the proportion is over half. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>The import penetration and the export share indicators include final as well as intermediate goods and <lb/>services, and describe the global linkages and interdependencies between countries in overall terms. In <lb/>order to better assess the position of countries in global value chains, the foreign dependency of countries <lb/>can be better described only in terms of intermediates. Specifically looking at intermediate inputs defined <lb/>in the I-O tables by the use made of goods and services, the ratio of imported to domestic sourcing of <lb/>inputs is given by: <lb/>Imported intermediates/domestic intermediates = ( <lb/>) ( <lb/>) <lb/>∑∑ <lb/>∑∑ <lb/>i <lb/>j <lb/>ij <lb/>d <lb/>i <lb/>j <lb/>ij <lb/>m <lb/>x <lb/>x / <lb/>where <lb/>ij <lb/>d <lb/>x <lb/>and <lb/>ij <lb/>m <lb/>x are respectively the domestic and imported transactions of intermediates from sector <lb/>i to sector j 3 . <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>Figure 3 shows the average ratios (for the entire economy) of imported to domestic sourcing of inputs <lb/>for the mid-1990s and early 2000s, based on information in the I-O tables. These figures provide a direct <lb/>indication of the extent of economies&apos; integration into global supply chains. The ratio of imported to <lb/>domestic input increased in almost all countries from 1995 to 2000, demonstrating the growing importance <lb/>of intermediate inputs in international trade and the increasing importance of international outsourcing. <lb/>Consistent with their typically greater international orientation because of their limited size, smaller <lb/>countries are found to import more intermediates from abroad. In Ireland, for example, domestic and <lb/>international sourcing is reported to be equally important, meaning that the same amount of intermediates <lb/>is sourced internationally as nationally (i.e. within the Irish economy). <lb/>MNEs are again considered to play a major role as the sourcing of intermediates within multinational <lb/>networks has become especially important in recent years (OECD, 2007a; Grossman and Rossi-Hanberg, <lb/>2006; Baldwin, 2006). The share of intra-firm exports in total exports of manufacturing affiliates under <lb/>foreign control has been reported to range between 15% and 60% in OECD countries (OECD, 2007a). This <lb/>intra-firm trade involves the export and import of nearly finished goods destined for affiliate firms that are <lb/>mainly involved in marketing and distribution with little additional manufacturing processing taking place. <lb/>But another and growing part of intra-firm trade concerns the exports and imports by foreign affiliates that <lb/>manufacture intermediate products destined for other affiliates. This last form is directly related to the <lb/>globalisation of value chains and has been increasing in host economies like China, Korea, Mexico, <lb/>Chinese Taipei and some Eastern European countries. <lb/>Indicators on offshoring <lb/>The offshoring of business activities including services has recently gained much attention, not least <lb/>because of the supposed adverse effects on domestic employment. However, the link between offshoring <lb/>and employment is not that obvious as different impacts have to be taken into account: direct and indirect <lb/>effects, short-and long-term effects, and employment and productivity effects. Offshoring (including <lb/>relocation) may lead in a first phase to short-term employment losses if certain activities are moved <lb/>off-shore or decline in importance. But globalisation has also positive impacts on productivity and may <lb/>thus reduce costs and prices, both in the activity being directly affected and in other activities that use the <lb/>products of this activity downstream. Bhagwati et al. (2004) emphasise that even if offshoring lowers <lb/>employment and wages in certain occupations, in other cases it probably helps to create new jobs in the <lb/>home country. <lb/>A major problem surrounding these discussions is that the empirical measurement of offshoring is <lb/>difficult because of data availability (OECD, 2007b; GAO, 2004). A measure that has been widely used in <lb/>empirical work is the &quot; outsourcing &quot; indicator suggested by Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999), calculated <lb/>as the share of imported intermediate inputs in the total purchase of non-energy materials of individual <lb/>industries. Typically, the information in I-O tables and more specifically the information in the imported <lb/>transactions matrix has been used for this. <lb/>However, it should first be noted that while Feenstra and Hanson call this outsourcing, it is in fact <lb/>offshoring, which is generally defined as companies&apos; purchases of intermediate goods and services from <lb/>foreign providers at arm&apos;s length, or the transfer of particular tasks from within the firm to a foreign <lb/>location, i.e. to foreign affiliates (Kirkegaard, 2004). Outsourcing refers to the purchasing of intermediate <lb/>goods and services from outside specialist providers at arm&apos;s length, be it nationally or internationally <lb/>(Figure 4). The cross-border aspect is the distinguishing feature in defining offshoring, i.e. whether goods <lb/>and services are sourced from within the domestic economy or abroad – not whether they are sourced from <lb/>within the same firm or external suppliers (OECD, 2007a). <lb/></body>

Girma and Gorg (2004) argue that this measure is too wide, especially for analyses at <lb/>the firm level 4 ; instead they prefer a measure originally developed by Abraham and Taylor (1996), which <lb/>includes only the contracting out of machine maintenance services, engineering and drafting services, <lb/>accounting services and computer services. Egger and Egger (2001) and Helg and Tajoli (2004) also use a <lb/>narrower measure restricting outsourcing to outward processing. Others like Gorg et al. (2004) and <lb/>Criscuolo and Leaver (2005) have more direct data on intermediate inputs, including e.g. raw materials and <lb/>components, and services inputs as well as the proportion of these sources abroad. A discussion of the <lb/>measurement issues associated with offshoring is given in OECD (2007b), with a focus on related labour <lb/>relations. <lb/>Notwithstanding these limitations, we have opted to build further on the work of Feenstra and Hanson <lb/>and used the OECD I-O database to compute the level of offshoring (OFFSH) as the share of non-energy <lb/>imported intermediate inputs in total non-energy intermediate inputs defined as: <lb/>OFFSH = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>+ ∑∑ <lb/>∑∑ <lb/>∑∑ <lb/>j <lb/>i <lb/>ij <lb/>m <lb/>j <lb/>i <lb/>ij <lb/>d <lb/>j <lb/>i <lb/>ij <lb/>m <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>/ <lb/>where <lb/>ij <lb/>m <lb/>ij <lb/>d <lb/>x <lb/>x and <lb/>are the domestic and imported transactions of intermediates from sector i to sector j <lb/>respectively and i excludes the energy sectors (mining and utility). <lb/>4. <lb/>Feenstra and Hanson have also proposed a narrower measure of outsourcing by restricting attention to only <lb/>those inputs that are purchased from the same industry as that in which the good is being produced. <lb/></body>

Not surprisingly, smaller countries typically report higher offshoring indicators, <lb/>notably Singapore, Luxembourg, Ireland and Hungary. Two large OECD countries, Japan (7.6%) and the <lb/>United States (10.3%) are found to offshore relatively little compared with other OECD countries. <lb/>Although the level in the large non-member countries such as Brazil, India, Argentina and China remains <lb/>lower than the OECD average, the offshoring of intermediates also gained importance in these countries <lb/>during the late 1990s. <lb/>The information in the OECD I-O Database also allows to analyse trends in offshoring taking the <lb/>manufacturing and services sectors separately. This allows to illustrate the increased offshoring of business <lb/>services in recent years. Figures 6 and 7 indicate that just like in manufacturing, the sourcing of <lb/>intermediates abroad in market services has increased in almost all countries. While offshoring of <lb/>intermediates just like the trade of final products has traditionally been occurring in manufacturing <lb/>industries, the emergence of global value chains increasingly stretches out to services sectors. <lb/>Notwithstanding this increase, the level of offshoring is still much lower in market services than in the total <lb/>group of manufacturing industries. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>The same offshoring indicator can also be constructed for groups of industries and/or individual <lb/>industries, providing more detailed insights into the phenomenon of offshoring in today&apos;s global economy. <lb/>Figure 8 shows that the sourcing of intermediates abroad is more prominent in higher technology industries <lb/>than in lower technology industries (higher technology industries are defined as high and medium-high <lb/>technology industries, ISICrev3: 24,29-35; while lower technology industries are defined as medium-low <lb/>and low technology industries, ISICrev3: 15-23,25-28,36-37). In most countries the offshoring indicator is <lb/>higher in the group of higher technology industries than in the group of lower technology industries, <lb/>reflecting the generally higher complexity of technology-intensive goods as they typically require a broad <lb/>range of inputs. The level of offshoring has increased in almost all countries in the higher technology as <lb/>well as the lower technology-intensive manufacturing industries, but sourcing of intermediates abroad <lb/>seems to have grown stronger in higher technology industries in most OECD countries. <lb/>Figure 9 presents the offshoring indicators with some internationally open industries as examples: <lb/>computers, radio/TV/communications equipment and textiles. The offshoring of activities is somewhat <lb/>higher in the high technology industries, computers and TV/radio/communications equipment, than in the <lb/>low technology textiles sector. Again, smaller countries are found to source relatively more internationally, <lb/>especially those countries that have a high presence of multinational firms, an observation that is consistent <lb/>with evidence reported earlier in this paper. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>Calculating higher-order effects: embodied imports and the foreign content of exports <lb/>Input-output tables also allow for the computation of indirect effects on national economies in <lb/>addition to the more direct effects discussed thus far. Instead of looking only at direct imports, it is <lb/>important to compute the so-called induced indirect imports when analysing the foreign dependency of <lb/>countries&apos; economies (Ahmad and Wyckoff, 2003). The underlying idea is that direct imports indicate the <lb/>direct contribution of foreign industries to the national production process, but this gives only a part of the <lb/>whole story. For example, if a computer manufacturer imports certain components (e.g. computer chips) <lb/>the direct import contribution will be the ratio of the value of these computer chips to the total value of the <lb/>computer. If the computer manufacturer purchases other components from domestic manufacturers, who in <lb/>turn use imports in their production process, those imports should also be included in the computer&apos;s value <lb/>in order to have an idea of the foreign dependency of a country&apos;s economy. 5 <lb/>A (large) part of the intermediates locally produced by suppliers incorporate foreign raw materials, <lb/>intermediaries such as parts and components, and semi-finished products produced abroad. In order to <lb/>calculate the total import content, e.g. of nationally produced computers, one has to complement the direct <lb/>imports bought and used directly by the computer fabricants, with the indirect imports, i.e. the imports <lb/>bought and used by suppliers of these computer fabricants. These total direct and indirect imports are <lb/>known as &quot; embodied imports &quot; and are calculated as: <lb/>IMP. CONT. = u * Am * (I-Ad) -1 * O/O k <lb/>where Am and Ad are the input-output coefficients for imported and domestic transactions respectively; u <lb/>denotes an 1 x n vector each of whose components is unity, the matrix O is an n x 1 vector of outputs, and <lb/>O k is total country output. <lb/>Figure 10 shows that the embodied imports have increased in 33 of the 34 countries, clearly <lb/>illustrating growing interdependence. Again, there are important differences between countries with <lb/>relatively low levels of embodied imports, which did not rise strongly between 1995 and 2000 (e.g. larger <lb/>countries like Australia, Japan and the United States). Smaller countries present relatively higher figures <lb/>than larger countries because of their limited size, while at the same time the inflow of FDI has also <lb/>contributed to this higher import dependency in these countries. The typical examples re-appear, e.g. <lb/>Luxembourg, Singapore, Ireland and Hungary. <lb/>5. <lb/>Re-exports defined as exports of foreign goods or foreign goods exported in the same state as previously <lb/>imported, have been excluded from the analysis. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></body>

Input-output tables measure the interrelationships between <lb/>the producers of goods and services (including imports) within an economy and the users of the same <lb/>goods and services (including exports). As such, they can be used to estimate the contribution that imports <lb/>make in the production of any good and service for export. The emergence of global value chains means <lb/>that imports and exports increasingly move together since the production process of companies is <lb/>increasingly characterised by sequential production and back-and-forth aspects. As such, exports are based <lb/>to a large or small extent on intermediate inputs that are imported from abroad, hence the need to <lb/>qualifythe export performance of countries. <lb/>Hummels et al. (1998, 2001) have introduced the term &quot; vertical specialisation &quot; in calculating the <lb/>direct and indirect imported inputs that are included in a country&apos;s exports. As a result of global value <lb/>chains and the corresponding geographical fragmentation of activities, countries become vertically <lb/>specialised within the production process for some goods or services as companies tend to concentrate <lb/>different production stages for a single good in each country. The vertical specialisation measures try to <lb/>reflect this process by which different countries become part of a single production chain, linking the <lb/>imported inputs required by one country with its exports. Since then several papers have computed the <lb/>import content of exports for different countries, e.g. Yi (2003), Bergoing et al. (2004) and Cardoso et al. <lb/>(2007); all found that vertical specialisation has increased over the years, illustrating not only increasing <lb/>integration but also – and especially – the increasing importance of global value chains. <lb/></body>

			<body>The calculation of the import content of exports using I-O information draws on some implicit <lb/>assumptions as extensively discussed by the US National Research Council of the National Academy of <lb/>Science (2006). It is typically assumed, for example, that the same input-output requirements apply for the <lb/>goods and services that are exported and those that are destined for final demand. Further on, calculations <lb/>are also based on the assumption that countries&apos; imports originate 100% from foreign sources, which is not <lb/>necessarily the case and may thus be a source of inaccuracy. However, measuring the domestic content of <lb/>countries&apos; imports is much more difficult as there is no input-output table that applies to the rest of the <lb/>world. Notwithstanding these limitations and assumptions, the study concludes that I-O data are the most <lb/>readily available source of information to gain insight into the increasing dependency of countries&apos; export <lb/>performance on imports. <lb/>The foreign content of countries&apos; exports (FOR.CONT. EXP.) is calculated as: <lb/>FOR. CONT. EXP. = u * Am * (I-Ad) -1 * X/X k <lb/>where Am and Ad contain the input-output coefficient for imported and domestic transaction, respectively; <lb/>u denotes an 1 x n vector, each of whose components is unity, the matrix X is an nx1 vector of exports and <lb/>X k is total country exports. An import content of exports of 20%, for example, means that 20% of the <lb/>exports are directly and indirectly based on imported intermediates. <lb/>Figure 11.

			<body>The import content of exports is found to be highest in more basic industries that make heavy use of <lb/>primary goods (Figure 11). Examples are mining and basic metals, but also chemicals and rubber and <lb/>plastics. A second group of industries that displays a rather high import content of exports includes higher <lb/>technology-intensive industries that produce modular products. Parts and components are often produced <lb/>in one country before they are exported to another where assembly takes place. This international division <lb/>of labour is found in industries such as electrical machinery, radio/television and communication <lb/>equipment, and office, accounting and computing machinery. <lb/>Figure 12. Import content of exports, individual countries, 1995 <lb/>1 and 2000 <lb/>2 <lb/>0% <lb/>10% <lb/>20% <lb/>30% <lb/>40% <lb/>50% <lb/>60% <lb/>70% <lb/>1995 <lb/>2000 <lb/>(1) 1995 data is 1994/95 for Australia, 1995/96 for New Zealand, 1996 for Turkey, 1997 for Argentina, 1996 for Chinese Taipei, <lb/>and 1993/94 for India; no data for Iceland, Mexico and Switzerland. <lb/>(2) 2000 data is 1998/99 for Australia, 1999 for Greece, 2002/03 for New Zealand, 1998 for Turkey, 2001 for Chinese Taipei, <lb/>and 1998/99 for India; no data for Iceland, Mexico, Argentina and Israel. <lb/>Source: OECD Input-Output Database. <lb/>The indicators for the individual countries show that between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the <lb/>import content of exports has increased in almost all countries (Figure 12). In larger countries like the <lb/>United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, exports depend relatively less on the imports of <lb/>intermediates sourced abroad. The increase in vertical specialisation becomes clearest in countries with a <lb/>high multinational presence like Ireland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Belgium, as the international <lb/>sourcing of intermediates within multinational networks drives the development of global value chains. <lb/>Foreign affiliates in different host countries produce intermediates that are then exported to final <lb/>consumers, but also to other affiliates and the headquarters of the multinational company. <lb/>Within the group of emerging countries, China and Indonesia demonstrate a larger dependence on <lb/>imported intermediates. The results for China illustrate the increasing international production sharing <lb/>within ICT industries, in which the more labour-intensive manufacturing activities are carried out in <lb/>emerging countries while the more skill-intensive activities remain clustered in developed countries <lb/>(Srholec, 2007). A triangular trade pattern in the ASEAN region has emerged in which parts and <lb/>components are produced by more developed economies like Japan, Chinese Taipei and Korea, and then <lb/>exported to emerging countries like China where the assembly of the different intermediates into finished <lb/>products takes place. This restructuring process has particularly accelerated over the last years, suggesting <lb/>that more recent data would show a higher import content of exports for China (Bolhoul et al., 2005; <lb/>OECD, 2007a). <lb/></body>

			<body>While the indicator on the import/foreign content of exports is of interest and illustrates important <lb/>trends, one should refrain from using this indicator without knowledge of policy discussions. The <lb/>underlying presumption that an increase in the foreign content of exports is problematic, and indicates that <lb/>a country is losing out in the global competition (US National Research Council, 2006). However, this <lb/>indicator does not necessarily say anything about the competitiveness of countries, and a growing import <lb/>content of exports does not necessarily signal shrinking competitiveness. It may even be the opposite if a <lb/>country successfully integrates the global value chains of high-growth industries. But the import content <lb/>of exports is above all a descriptive indicator about the (changing) structure and dynamics of countries, that <lb/>together with other appropriate indicators could be used in discussing countries&apos; competitiveness. <lb/>Employment effects – job embodiment of trade <lb/>The OECD I-O database has also been used in a thought experiment similar to the work by Groshen et <lb/>al. (2005) who, on the basis of trade data and input-output tables, calculate the net effect of trade on total <lb/>US employment. The Groshen study is among the few that not only focuses on the potentially negative <lb/>consequences of offshoring and the resulting raise in imports, but also on the potentially positive effects of <lb/>inshoring or exports. Both the jobs that may be lost through imports and the jobs that are created through <lb/>exports are considered. This approach measures both the number of workers that are needed to produce the <lb/>goods and services imported into the United States at current wages, prices and productivity levels, and the <lb/>number of workers that are needed to produce US exports of goods and services. Moreover, by using input-<lb/>output tables the study also accounts for indirect effects that are associated with impacts on other sectors. <lb/>However, it should be stressed that this approach has some major weaknesses because of assumptions <lb/>relating to constant-factor input shares, no differences in quality between goods, etc. Furthermore, because <lb/>in calculating the jobs embodied in imports as well as exports we use the industry technologies of the <lb/>country, it is implicitly assumed that the technologies for import and export goods and services are <lb/>identical. In addition, the figures are clearly the result of a thought experiment as imports and national <lb/>production are assumed to be perfectly interchangeable with no costs (e.g. in production technology). <lb/>Lastly and more importantly, because of its static nature, dynamic gains of trade which are typically very <lb/>important, are not taken into account. As such, the results only give a partial view of trade, and should be <lb/>interpreted accordingly. <lb/>In order to calculate the jobs embodied in trade for individual countries, the analysis firstly computes <lb/>the number of jobs that would be needed to produce the goods and services imported in each country. This <lb/>provides a sort of international trade &quot; employment loss &quot; , hypothetically assuming that all imports would be <lb/>replaced by domestic production. Secondly, the &quot; employment gain &quot; of international trade is computed as <lb/>the number of jobs that are needed to produce the goods and services that are exported from each <lb/>individual country. By subtracting the number of jobs needed to produce the goods and services imported <lb/>by each country from the number of jobs needed to produce goods and services exported by that country, a <lb/>net measure of the employment effect of trade is obtained. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/DOC(2007)8 <lb/></note>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>The calculation of jobs embodied in trade makes use of the employment multipliers that are computed <lb/>on the basis of the national input-output tables for individual countries. These employment impacts are <lb/>then related to the value of gross imports and exports of individual countries. The employment multipliers <lb/>provide the estimates of how much employment in the total economy (taking into account direct and <lb/>indirect effects) will increase if the final demand increases by one unit. The employment multiplier for <lb/>each industry i is calculated as: <lb/>F i x (I-A) -1 x (O/LC) IO (LC/E) STAN <lb/>where F i is a row matrix representing the change in final demand for industry i with one unit, (I-A) -1 is the <lb/>(square) inverse Leontief matrix and (O/LC) IO (LC/) STAN is a column matrix representing the inverse of <lb/>labour productivity in each industry. LC is labour compensation of employment and IO and STAN refer to <lb/>the OECD I-O database and OECD STAN database. These employment multipliers are then multiplied by <lb/>the amounts of exports and imports, thereby assuming that the imports flows to final users in each country <lb/>are now produced in that country. <lb/>The results are presented in Table 4; in order to easily interpret the absolute figures, the results are <lb/>also expressed relative to the total employment in each country. The jobs embodied in trade are on average <lb/>larger (in relative terms) for smaller countries, given their smaller size and consequently their stronger <lb/>international orientation. The size of countries, however, is not a prediction of whether countries &quot; win or <lb/>lose &quot; from international trade; smaller as well as larger countries show positive/negative net impacts of <lb/>trade on employment. Countries with a positive net employment impact are &quot; winning &quot; from international <lb/>trade as calculated here: the jobs embodied in their exports (the employment &quot; gain &quot; of trade) exceeds the <lb/>number of jobs embodied in their imports (the employment &quot; loss &quot; ). <lb/>Overall, the rather small numbers of jobs embodied in net imports relative to total employment clearly <lb/>suggest that globalisation is not the main explanation for worsening employment performance in some <lb/>countries. Globalisation is clearly a two-way process where offshoring and imports are compensated by <lb/>insourcing and exports. Only in countries like Ireland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic does the <lb/> &quot; employment loss &quot; of international trade seem rather large. Several factors explain these results, such as <lb/>the rather large trade deficits some East European countries have run as their economic development has <lb/>accelerated. Ireland, however, reports a positive trade balance; the negative net impact of trade-embodied <lb/>jobs is explained by the fact that the trade surplus is accumulated especially in non-labour-intensive <lb/>industries while sector trade deficits appear in low-productive, labour-intensive industries. Once again, it <lb/>should be stressed that this approach only takes into account static (direct and indirect) effects, and that <lb/>longer-term, dynamic effects are not included. <lb/></body>

			<body>Conclusions and future directions for research <lb/>Despite the typical disadvantages of published I-O tables (such as timeliness, sector classifications, <lb/>etc), this paper has shown that I-O may be a complementary source of information for measuring and <lb/>analysing globalisation. Using the OECD I-O Database, containing harmonised I-O tables for <lb/>38 economies (OECD and non-OECD), different indicators are being developed to allow analysis of some <lb/>distinctive characteristics of current globalisation. The proposed indicators specifically measure the <lb/>emergence of global value chains with their corresponding import and export flows of intermediate inputs, <lb/>and the increasing offshoring of services can be discussed in more detail. <lb/>Of course the quality of the indicators presented directly depends on the information gathered within <lb/>national I-O tables and their international comparability. While I-O tables have been harmonised as much <lb/>as possible, reporting differences between countries (e.g. consolidated accounts, establishment vs. <lb/>enterprise) may to some extent bias the results. <lb/>The OECD I-O Database may also be an important instrument for future research on globalisation. <lb/>Linking the OECD I-O Database with bilateral trade data would extend the scope of the analysis; as such <lb/>the effects of the increasing integration of emerging countries like in the global economy could be studied <lb/>in more detail. While I-O tables typically allow for the calculation of direct and indirect effects through the <lb/>total economy, these kinds of analyses are confronted with the traditional limitations of I-O tables (lack of <lb/>dynamic effects and constant productivity). <lb/>The OECD I-O Database represents a major input not only for descriptive statistics as I-O indicators <lb/>could be used in more applied analysis. The impact of the increasing integration of countries on national <lb/>employment, productivity levels and growth could be discussed in more detail. <lb/></body>
