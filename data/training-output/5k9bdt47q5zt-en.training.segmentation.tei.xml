			<front>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Income inequality in the European Union <lb/>Poor growth performance over the past decades in Europe has increased concerns for rising income <lb/>dispersion and social exclusion. European authorities have recently launched the Europe 2020 strategy <lb/>which aims to improve social inclusion in Europe on top of already existing European regional policies <lb/>aiming to reduce regional disparities through stimulating growth in areas where incomes are relatively low. <lb/>While it is most common to confine measures of inequality to national borders, the existence of such <lb/>union-wide objectives and policies motivates measuring income dispersion among all Europeans in this <lb/>paper. Towards the end of the 2000s the income distribution in Europe was more unequal than in the <lb/>average OECD country, albeit notably less so than in the United States. It is the within-country, not the <lb/>between-country dimension, which appears to be most important. Inequality in Europe has risen quite <lb/>substantially since the mid 1980s. While the EU enlargement process has contributed to this, it is not the <lb/>only explanation since inequality has also increased within a &quot; core &quot; of 8 European countries. Large income <lb/>gains among the 10% top earners appear to be a main driver behind this evolution. <lb/>JEL Classification: C81 ; D31 ; D63 ; H23 ; Z18 <lb/>Keywords: European Union; income inequality; Gini; convergence; top incomes; redistribution <lb/>* * * * * <lb/>L&apos;inégalité des revenus dans l&apos;Union européenne <lb/></front>

			<body>La faible croissance en Europe au cours des dernières décennies a augmenté les inquiétudes concernant la <lb/>répartition des revenus et l&apos;exclusion sociale. Les autorités européennes ont récemment lancé la stratégie <lb/>Europe 2020 qui vise à améliorer l&apos;insertion sociale en Europe en plaçant cet objectif au dessus des <lb/>politiques régionales européennes déjà existantes afin de réduire les disparités régionales en stimulant la <lb/>croissance dans les zones où les revenus sont relativement bas. Alors que l&apos;inégalité est, le plus <lb/>fréquemment, mesurée par pays, le fait de mettre en place des objectifs et des politiques à l&apos;échelle <lb/>européenne explique pourquoi ce rapport traite de l&apos;inégalité des revenus entre tous les Européens. Vers la <lb/>fin des années 2000, la distribution des revenus en Europe était plus inégalitaire que la moyenne de la zone <lb/>de l&apos;OCDE mais beaucoup moins qu&apos;aux États-Unis.

			<body>INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION <lb/>By Kaja Bonesmo Fredriksen 1 <lb/>1. Introduction <lb/>Many European countries have faced sluggish growth over the past decades and the trend has <lb/>worsened in recent years. Contrary to economic booms when most individuals are likely to see substantial <lb/>increases in their income, low growth tends to bring out concerns about stagnating incomes, rising <lb/>inequality and poverty. The recession of the past few years has not only increased attention to rising <lb/>inequalities in OECD countries, but also evoked growing academic and political interest in finding broader <lb/>measures for economic performance than GDP growth. These have included social dimensions, such as <lb/>income dispersion, and various indicators of wellbeing. 2 <lb/>While inequality is often viewed from a national perspective, there are good reasons to analyse it for <lb/>Europe as a whole. Union-wide policies and objectives are already in place in a number of areas. In the <lb/>social sphere, the Europe 2020 strategy defines inclusive growth as one of three main priorities for the <lb/>European Union (EU) and one of the headline targets is 20 million less Europeans in or at risk of poverty <lb/>and social exclusion by 2020. According to Eurostat, the number of such individuals amounted to <lb/>115 million in 2010. European regional policies, which are absorbing more than a third of EU budget <lb/>(OECD 2007), have also focused on stimulating growth in areas where incomes are relatively low to <lb/>reduce regional disparities. Policies for redistributing individual incomes remain however at the sole <lb/>charge of national governments. Finally, with deeper integration Europeans are likely to look more beyond <lb/>their national borders when they make relative income comparisons. <lb/>There are, however, important methodological challenges to measuring income dispersion in the <lb/>European Union as a whole. Creating meaningful statistics that summarise cross-country heterogeneity in <lb/>income levels and distributions from scarce and often not fully comparable income data is not easy. For <lb/>this reason much of the existing literature on inequality in the EU still focuses on national levels and trends <lb/>in inequality, which is at times complemented by attempts at clustering countries showing similar <lb/>characteristics. Eurostat publishes measures of income dispersion and poverty in the EU as weighted <lb/>averages of national inequality indicators. Measures of European Union-wide inequality that take into <lb/>account income dispersion between European countries are rare. <lb/>This paper provides a picture of the state and evolution of inequality in the European Union using <lb/>OECD average household disposable income data per decile from the Income Distribution and Poverty <lb/>Database. It includes 20 EU countries and for most of them covers a time span from the mid-1980s until <lb/>2008. 3 <lb/>1. <lb/>The author is seconded from the Norwegian Ministry of Finance and works at the Economics Department <lb/>of the OECD. This is one of the technical working papers prepared as background for the Economic <lb/>Survey of the European Union 2012. The author would like to thank Sebastian Barnes especially, and also <lb/>Piritta Sorsa and Peter Hoeller for their useful comments and suggestions, Isabelle Duong and Clara Garcia <lb/>for meticulous statistical work and Olivier Besson for excellent editorial support. <lb/>The paper does not aim to put on the table any new evidence why inequality differs among <lb/>European countries nor what has driven the change in inequality over time. The main contribution of the <lb/>2. <lb/>The conclusions of the Stiglitz-Fitoussi-Sen Commission initiated in 2008 provide a good example. <lb/>3. <lb/>Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Romania are not included in the database. Austria, <lb/>Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland, Portugal and Spain are excluded from the time serie <lb/>analysis because of a statistical break in 2004. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)29 <lb/></body>

			<body>paper is twofold: Exploit the rich time dimension in the OECD database to analyse how income growth <lb/>over time has been shared among individuals in European countries as well as to go beyond the traditional <lb/>national approach and consider inequality in the Union as a whole. The methodology used for the latter is <lb/>inspired by among others Brandolini (2007) who looks at EU inequality and Milanovic (2002) who looks <lb/>at global inequality using household survey sources. Given the difficulty of the exercise, an additional aim <lb/>of the paper is to ensure transparency in the results obtained by properly accounting for the methodological <lb/>challenges as well as the methodological choices made. Section 2 reviews how growth in total income over <lb/>the past 25 years has been shared among deciles in EU countries. The approach in this section remains <lb/> &quot; national &quot; in the sense that the EU-aggregates are population-weighted national averages. The measure of <lb/>inequality for the European Union as a whole is then presented in Section 3. Section 4 summarises the <lb/>results. <lb/>2. Income growth, but not necessarily (and as much) for all <lb/>EU disposable income growth has been slightly below OECD average with large differences between <lb/>countries <lb/>Over the past 25 years, household disposable income per capita rose on average by almost 70% in the <lb/>OECD (3.1% annually), with somewhat smaller annual growth over the past 15 years (Table 1). In the EU, <lb/>average annual growth was 2.5%. Unsurprisingly, there was quite a difference between the fastest and <lb/>slowest growing European countries, a token of the area&apos;s heterogeneity. This also underlines the <lb/>importance of including the between-country dimension when analyzing inequality over time. Italians have <lb/>seen the lowest growth in their incomes since 1995 while the so-called &quot; catching up economies &quot; such as <lb/>Ireland, Poland and the Slovak Republic have gained the most. Compared to both the United States and the <lb/>whole OECD, Europeans on average and especially in the euro area appear to have lost ground, mainly <lb/>because the performance of the European &quot; core &quot; , Germany and Italy, has been relatively weak. <lb/></body>

Income growth can be very concentrated in a few hands, a well-known phenomenon <lb/>from developing and emerging market economies, and there is evidence that this is increasingly the case <lb/>for advanced economies as well (OECD, 2012). Because macro data derived from the national accounts <lb/>only consider national averages, to see how income growth is shared between individuals it is necessary to <lb/>turn to individual-level data, either based on household income surveys or tax data. There are some caveats <lb/>with micro data, most notably a tendency not to capture very well the extremes of the distribution and <lb/>therefore to underestimate inequality. Because of this, and other conceptual differences, there will always <lb/>be discrepancies between micro data and macro data (Annex 1). <lb/>Distribution of income growth has become more unequal driven by changes in the extremes <lb/>The micro data used in this study is derived from national disposable income surveys and covers the <lb/>entire population. It has been harmonised by national experts via pre-established conventions and <lb/>definitions which enhances cross-country comparability. Another advantage of this particular database is <lb/>that for many countries it goes back to mid-1980s, making it possible to see how inequality has evolved <lb/>over a longer period during which the Union underwent many important changes, notably the addition of <lb/>several new countries. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)29 <lb/></body>

			<body>Annual average income growth over the past 25 years has been quite low for most deciles in Europe, <lb/>though some still saw their income grow quite substantially (Figure 1). Part of this difference is due to <lb/>differences in aggregate growth performance of European countries. In Greece, for instance, all deciles <lb/>have seen their income grow more than any German decile has. But there has also been a clear pattern <lb/>between income growth and income ranking, which becomes even clearer when countries that are outliers <lb/>in terms of growth performance 4 <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>In general the 10% highest income recipients have seen their incomes grow much more rapidly than <lb/>the rest of the population over the past 25 years (Box 1). This is not only a European phenomenon. Top <lb/>incomes have also been sprinting ahead in the United States. For the OECD as a whole, OECD (2012) <lb/>finds that from 1980 to 2008 the share of income captured by top income recipients rose in most OECD <lb/>countries, though there has been great variation with respect both to the extent of this increase and when it <lb/>started. A second, less striking, observation is that while income growth in European countries on average <lb/>has been similar from d2 to d9, the 10% poorest are losing out. Again, the same has happened (and has <lb/>even been more accentuated) in the United States. <lb/>Box 1. Causes of inequality <lb/>Cross-country differences in the level of disposable income inequality can be traced back to differences in labour <lb/>market outcomes, household composition, concentration of capital income and differences in the progressivity of tax <lb/>and transfer systems <lb/>1 . The OECD (2012) &quot; Less income inequality and more growth-Are they compatible? &quot; project <lb/>categorizes countries <lb/>2 into 5 groups according to inequality origins and finds great variation among EU countries. This <lb/>box summarizes the findings in this project, OECD (2011) &quot; Divided We Stand: Why Inequality keeps rising &quot; as well as <lb/>a few other recent studies on inequality and top incomes. <lb/>The Scandinavian countries and Switzerland have low dispersion in labour earnings while cash transfers tend to <lb/>be universal and taxes are not very progressive. In Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Slovak <lb/>Republic and Slovenia wage dispersion tends to be low but so does employment rates whereas part time rates are <lb/>high. Taxes and transfers are not highly progressive. Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland and <lb/>Spain are characterized by rather concentrated labour earnings but much redistribution happens at the family level. <lb/>The United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands have high part time employment rates driving inequality in labour <lb/>market outcomes. Taxes and transfers have a sizeable redistributive impact. Portugal is the only European country in <lb/>the last group with high concentration in both labour, capital and self-employment income as well as a high poverty <lb/>rate. Transfers have little redistributive impact. <lb/>Looking at the evolution of inequality over time reveals a more common pattern among European countries. The <lb/>top decile appears to be capturing an increasing share of total income. The same holds true in largely all OECD <lb/>countries that have seen a rise in income dispersion over the past two decades. Indeed, the rise in top incomes in <lb/>continental Europe appears rather modest compared to what has been the case in some Anglo-Saxon countries and <lb/>notably the United States, especially if one looks at the top 1% of the distribution. <lb/>3 There is no consensus around the <lb/>causes for this development. Prominent explanations found in the literature include both changes in taxation, labour <lb/>market institutions as well as globalization and technological change. <lb/>Many OECD countries have seen a decline in the progressivity of the tax schedule at the upper tail of the income <lb/>distribution <lb/>4 over the past decade due to both a decline in top marginal tax rates and an increased income threshold <lb/>from which rates apply. In Europe the picture has been mixed with tax progressivity among top earners decreasing <lb/>quite substantially in Denmark and Ireland, and to a smaller extent, in France, while it has increased in the Czech <lb/>Republic, Hungary, Greece and the Netherlands. Only marginal changes have occurred in the other countries. In <lb/>addition to the changes in the personal income tax schedule, wealth taxes have been recently been abolished in <lb/>Austria (1997), Denmark (1997), Germany (1997), Finland (2006), Luxemburg (2006), Sweden (2007) and Spain <lb/>(2008). <lb/>Restricting the analysis to the top 1% of the distribution, Piketty et al. (2011) find a strong negative relationship <lb/>between top income shares and top income tax rates over the period 1975 to 2008. No country has seen a rise in the <lb/>share of top incomes without significant cuts in top rate tax rates. The correlation appears to be stronger in Anglo-<lb/>Saxon countries than in some European countries. Top rate tax cuts are found to increase the income of the richest <lb/>mainly because they induce top earners to bargaining more for higher salaries and not because they work more or <lb/>resort to less tax avoidance. <lb/>Globalization and technological change may also have led to an increase in the return to skills and thus incomes <lb/>in the top decile relative to the rest of the population. At the utmost extreme of the distribution, higher returns for certain <lb/>types of talent, notably in the sport and entertainment industry as well as financial traders, are likely to have <lb/>contributed to increased relative income of the top 1% (Rosen, 1981; Gordon and Dew-Becker, 2008). The reward for <lb/>managerial skills is also likely to have been positively affected from globalization among other things as a result of <lb/>improved alternative carrier options available and internationalized competition for managers which have strengthened <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>their bargaining power. Growing use of performance related pay, and particularly for CEOs and finance professionals, <lb/>adds weight to these explanations especially in the case of United States. <lb/>At the other end of the distribution, the bottom decile in Europe has on average seen lower income growth than <lb/>the rest of the population. Certain facets of globalization may shed some light over this development. More <lb/>international trade may have lowered employment or reduced the relative earnings of low-income workers if high-<lb/>income workers work disproportionately in (high-productivity) exporting firms. Changes in the labour market may also <lb/>have played a role. The strength of labour market institutions and policies has on average declined over the past 20 to <lb/>25 years in many OECD countries. This may have had an adverse effect on low earners in the countries concerned. <lb/>However, many such policies (e.g. employment protection legislation, minimum wage) have opposite effects on <lb/>employment and wage dispersion leaving the final impact on inequality undetermined. <lb/>__________________________________________________ <lb/>1. A tax is considered to be progressive when the tax paid by of high income groups constitutes a higher share of their income than for lower earners. Similarly, a <lb/>transfer is considered to be progressive when it constitutes a larger share of a low income than a higher income (relative progressivity). <lb/>2. The benchmark is the OECD average. <lb/>3. Observations based on tax data. Includes all income subjected to the personal income tax. <lb/>4. Earnings are between the gross average wage and 167% of the gross average wage. <lb/>Going beyond this general picture, there are some interesting outliers (Tables 2 and 3): <lb/>• Disposable income growth has been very low almost throughout the distribution in both Germany <lb/>and the Netherlands, in particular in the lower deciles. This is especially evident from the mid-<lb/>1990s to 2008 when 30% of the poorest Germans actually had negative real income growth. <lb/>Koske et al. (2012) note Germany is the only country that has seen an increase in labour earnings <lb/>inequality from the mid 1990s to the end 2000s driven by increasing inequality in the bottom half <lb/>of the distribution. Recent years wage moderation can to some extent be explained by weakening <lb/>power of unions since the mid-1990s, as well as a set of reforms in 2003 meant to increase the <lb/>flexibility of the labour market (Burda and Hunt, 2011). Evidence suggests that unions reduce <lb/>income disparities, though there may be some cross-country variation in the link between the two <lb/>(Koske et al., 2012).<lb/>The tax and transfer system mitigated some of these effects in Germany at least over the <lb/>latter period since the inequality reducing effect of both taxes and particularly public transfers <lb/>increased from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (OECD, 2008). This has not happened in the <lb/>Netherlands. An extensive overhaul of the Dutch social security system starting in the early <lb/>1980s is probably the main cause why Förster and Pearson (2002) find a larger loss of disposable <lb/>income in the lowest decile in the Netherlands compared to the loss in market income from the <lb/>mid-1980s to mid-1990s. From 1995 to 2005, taxes in the Netherlands became more progressive, <lb/>whereas the inequality reducing effect of social transfers continued declining. <lb/>• In the United Kingdom the poorest 10% of the population have fared particularly badly compared <lb/>with the rest of the population. Both higher unemployment, which began climbing from the early <lb/>1980s, and big increases in the number of inactive persons during recessions in the 1980s and <lb/>1990s are likely to have contributed, however cannot fully explain what has happened since other <lb/>OECD countries have seen similar changes in labour market outcomes. Also, the increasing trend <lb/>in unemployment was reversed from the mid-1990s. What makes the United Kingdom stand out <lb/>is an important increase in the dispersion of earnings (Förster and Pearson, 2002).<lb/>Policy changes are also likely to have contributed to low income growth in the bottom of the <lb/>distribution. Brandolini and Smeeding (2009) document a very significant drop in the equalizing <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)29 <lb/></body>

			<body>effect of taxes and transfers in the United Kingdom from the early 1980s, although this trend <lb/>appears to be reversed since the turn of the century. Focusing only on the period between the mid <lb/>1990s and mid 2000s, OECD (2008) finds no change in the redistributive impact of taxes and <lb/>transfers. <lb/>• Contrary to what happened in most countries, the lowest deciles in Greece and Hungary gained <lb/>over the period compared to the rest of the population. This is also the case for the poorest <lb/>Italians from the mid-1990s. In Italy the redistributive impact of taxes and transfers increased <lb/>significantly from the mid 1990s to mid 2000s while no such data is available for Greece.<lb/>Table 2.

From the mid-<lb/>1990s to 2008 the Gini decreased (meaning more equality) in Greece, Hungary and Italy, while it increased <lb/></body>

Consider the example of <lb/>Denmark: Over the period from the mid-1990s to 2008, the Danes in the lowest decile saw their income <lb/>rise by 1% whereas those in the highest decile increased their income by 29%. Given what they earned in <lb/>1995, by 2008 the poorest 10% earned 1100 DKK more in absolute terms and the richest 109 000 DKK <lb/>more. Imagine now that the poorest would have captured an equal share of total income growth, and thus <lb/>also increased their income their 1995 incomes by 29%. Their absolute income would then be 25 000 <lb/>DKK, which is still a lot less than the richest 10% gained in absolute terms. The reverse is of course also <lb/>true, a given negative income growth rate implies higher absolute income losses in the upper part of the <lb/>distribution. <lb/>3. Creating a single European Union income distribution <lb/>Until now EU aggregates have been obtained by taking into account differences in the size of the <lb/>population between countries. This way of measuring inequality in European countries is in line with <lb/>Eurostat&apos;s official statistics and retains a national perspective on inequality: What matters for the <lb/>individual is the relative income position in their own country. However, for the reasons outlined it the <lb/>introduction to this paper, it is also valuable to measure inequality in Europe as whole. To do this one must <lb/>take into account between-country inequality which is likely to be large given the heterogeneity of the <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)29 <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>countries in the Union. In this approach to EU inequality, the poorest 10% of Europeans are not the sum of <lb/>the 10% poorest in all countries but are likely to be disproportionately from the lower income Eastern <lb/>European countries, and conversely the richest 10% are likely to come from the original EU and the Nordic <lb/>countries. <lb/>The aim of this section is to construct such an aggregate measure of inequality for the whole EU that <lb/>encompasses both within-and between country inequalities. A single European income distribution for the <lb/>whole population was created by stacking the average income of each decile for every country. Income <lb/>dispersion was then measured both by the Gini index as well as the q5/q1 and p90/p10 ratios weighting for <lb/>differences in total population since the number of persons receiving average income of decile x in country <lb/>y depends on the total population of country y. 5 <lb/>The data are adjusted for household composition and price level differences <lb/>The final sample is as such divided into non-identically <lb/>sized (income, population) groups. <lb/>Measuring inequality is not simple, and there are added problems in a cross-country context. Micro <lb/>data sources are generally based on household surveys, and must therefore be adjusted to take into account <lb/>differences in household composition. These differences are generally dealt with using an equivalence <lb/>scale that adjusts for the number of people in the household and whether they are adults or children. There <lb/>are many such equivalence scales to choose from. Szulc (2006) argues that the original OECD equivalence <lb/>scale 6 may be more appropriate to use for Poland and other &quot; less developed &quot; countries than the modified <lb/>OECD equivalence scale 7 as households in such countries tend to spend a higher share of their income on <lb/>food where economies of scale are generally low and a lower share on housing were economies of scale <lb/>are generally larger. The data for this paper is adjusted using the square root scale 8 <lb/>The income needed to purchase a given amount of goods by households is likely to vary by region <lb/>since price levels differ. National income data typically do not adjust for differences in price levels within <lb/>a county, nor does the OECD database. When measuring inequality across countries where the standard of <lb/>living generally varies much more, taking this into account becomes even more important. This can be <lb/>done using either PPP or nominal exchange rates. PPP measures the price for a same basket of goods in <lb/>different countries and as such overcomes the problem of market exchange rates that are not only <lb/>influenced by relative price levels, but also by other factors. <lb/>. <lb/>The PPP method has however problems of its own, notably that the content of a typical consumption <lb/>basket varies across countries and along the income distribution. Conform to what is common in the <lb/>literature, PPP conversion is still the option preferred in this paper. For comparison purposes, results are <lb/>also presented using nominal exchange rates. The latter shows a much higher level of inequality, which is <lb/>consistent both with theory and the literature. <lb/>5. <lb/>The ineqdec0 command in Stata was used to measure inequality. The function aw was used to weight for <lb/>differences in population size. <lb/>6. <lb/>Assigns a value of 1 to the first household member, of 0.7 to each additional adult member and of 0.5 to <lb/>each child. <lb/>7. <lb/>Assigns a value of 1 to the household head, of 0.5 to each additional adult member and of 0.3 to each child. <lb/>8. <lb/>Divides household income by the square root of household size. <lb/></body>

			<body>Inequality can be measured in a number of at times complementary ways <lb/>Many inequality measures exist and the choice of indicator is not neutral in the sense that they focus <lb/>on different distributional aspects, and also differ somewhat in their sensitivity to changes in the tails <lb/>versus the middle of the distribution. Evans et al. (2004) show that while the Gini, Theil and Robin Hood <lb/>indexes as well as the q5/q1 quintile ratio are highly correlated, the coefficient of variation and the p90/p10 <lb/>percentile ratio are less well correlated with the others. In this paper, results are mainly reported using the <lb/>Gini index which is the most frequently used measure of inequality. <lb/>However, a drawback of the Gini index is that it does not allow one to focus on particular segments of <lb/>the income distribution. Using income ratios between various quintiles, percentiles and deciles allows a <lb/>more detailed picture of how one distribution differs from another which is why results for EU inequality <lb/>measured by the p90/p10 and q5/q1 ratios are also presented. The two complement each other in the sense <lb/>that while the former is necessary to analyse the very top of the distribution, it is also likely less robust than <lb/>the q5/q1 ratio as the income data for the lowest decile probably includes households with temporary or <lb/>artificially low income such as students or tax avoiders (though the extent of the problem is difficult to <lb/>know). <lb/>A problem specific to the OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database is that income is reported <lb/>as average income per decile. Inequality within each decile is therefore lost in the final results. There is no <lb/>way to truly by-pass this problem 9 <lb/>9 . <lb/>The authors of the World Bank Development Report 2006 argue that estimating Lorenz curves instead of <lb/>assigning everyone inside a group the average income is a better approach. In order to do this, one has to <lb/>make an assumption about the shape of the income distribution within the group for which only average <lb/>income is available. Milanovic (2006) assumes a log-normal income distribution in all countries in his <lb/>measure of world inequality. <lb/>. However, one can indicatively evaluate the size of the bias, which <lb/>depends on the convexity of the Lorenz curve (the degree of intra-decile inequality), by comparing income <lb/>dispersion calculated using the OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database with a different database <lb/>which reports the income of every household such as Eurostat&apos;s and the Luxemburg Income Study (LIS). <lb/>The correlation between the national Gini coefficients calculated on OECD data and the Eurostat and LIS <lb/>numbers in table 5 is 0.97 and 0.86 respectively, whereas that between the Eurostat and LIS numbers is <lb/>0.89. This exercise is, however, incomplete because there are differences between the databases other than <lb/>that the OECD micro base reports income per decile that will affect the correlations. OECD (2008) <lb/>Growing Unequal concludes that for most OECD-countries the difference between the data sources is <lb/>small, although it is non-negligible in some cases. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)29 <lb/></body>

Some differences are to be <lb/>expected as the studies do not always include the same countries, nor refer to the same time period. <lb/>Unsurprisingly, the result obtained (0.33) is higher than inequality calculated both as a simple average of <lb/>national Gini indexes (0.29) and a population-weighted average (0.31) since the latter two methods do not <lb/>take into account the between-country component of European inequality. <lb/>Inequality in Europe is somewhat higher compared with the average national Gini indicator for the <lb/>OECD as whole which is 0.30. However, if one constrains the comparison to economies of comparable <lb/>size, which is probably more relevant, the European Union appears less unequal. In 2008, the Gini index <lb/>for the United States was 0.38. The difference appears to be in both ends of distribution, as both the top <lb/>and bottom deciles are closer to the median in Europe.

			<body>The Gini index for the United States is unadjusted for differences in price levels across the country, <lb/>whereas for the EU, the calculated Gini index takes into account at least the price differences between <lb/>countries. Dauderstädt and Keltek (2011) find that using exchange rates instead of PPP makes the EU-27 <lb/>more unequal than the United States. When the OECD micro data is converted using exchange rates, the <lb/>EU Gini index climbs to 0.35 (Table 8). This is not very different from the result using PPPs and still <lb/>below the Gini index in the United States. It should also be kept in mind that prices probably vary much <lb/>more across Europe than the United States meaning that it need not be better to compare the EU Gini using <lb/>exchange rates and the Gini index for the United States. <lb/>Table 8.

Its contribution amounts to 85% of total inequality, whereas the between-<lb/>component is at cause for the remaining 15%. This result is line with what other studies have found (e.g. <lb/>Beblo and Knaus, 2000 and Papatheodorou et al., 2003).

			<body>Inequality has risen in the EU sample for which comparable data from the mid-1980s is available <lb/>(Table 9). Extending the analysis to include Hungary is possible, but at the cost of reducing the number of <lb/>years to keep a balanced panel (Baseline 2). However, the picture remains the same. Much of the increase <lb/>appears to have happened before the turn of the century. In the early 2000s inequality appears to have <lb/>stood still or even decreased somewhat, but in recent years it is yet again on the rise. The break in 2004 <lb/>unfortunately prevents further enlargements of the sample. <lb/>The increasing trend in inequality in Europe is not unique. Dispersion in household disposable income <lb/>also increased in most other OECD countries between the mid-1980s and the end-2000s (OECD, 2011). <lb/>From the mid-1990s and onwards, country patterns started diverging more and the average increase <lb/>became smaller. In the United States inequality has increased substantially since the mid-1980s, and much <lb/>more as compared to the EU baseline scenario. Most of the increase happened between 1984 and 1995 <lb/>when the Gini index rose from 0.34 to 0.36 and in the earliest years of this century. <lb/>Although it would be very interesting to disentangle the cyclical effects from the structural evolution <lb/>in inequality over time, in practice this is very hard to do. First of all, it is not obvious how inequality and <lb/>the cycle should interact. During a boom (bust) all incomes will increase (decrease) thus the net effect on <lb/>the Gini index is a priori undetermined. Financial market developments are however likely to impact <lb/>capital income in particular which is highly concentrated in the upper end of the distribution. Secondly, <lb/>even if there was a clear link between income dispersion and the cycle, policies and institutions are likely <lb/>to respond to the cycle so as to mitigate the impact on inequality making it very hard to evaluate the actual <lb/>cyclical component. <lb/>EU enlargements, especially that of Eastern Europe, have contributed to rising inequality <lb/>Expansions of the European Union over the period increased inequality. Adding Spain and Portugal <lb/>that joined the Union in 1986 as well as Austria, Finland and Sweden that joined in 1995, to the sample in <lb/>the mid-1990s increases the Gini indicator to 0.30 compared to 0.29 when only the 10 countries that where <lb/>a part of the European Union in 1985 are considered. The p9/p1 is on the contrary slightly reduced. The <lb/>increase in the Gini is, however, only due to the expansion in 1986, as the inclusion of Austria, Finland and <lb/>Sweden left inequality unchanged or even induced a slight decline. The expansion in 2004 led to a more <lb/>significant increase in inequality; adding the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia to <lb/>the sample increases the Gini in 2008 from 0.31 to 0.33. Adhesions of new member states is however not <lb/>the only explanation for rising inequality as inequality in the 8 original countries for which comparable <lb/>data is available has also risen over the past 25 years (Table 10). <lb/>Table 10.

Excluding the <lb/>catching up economies (Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the Eastern European countries) from the sample <lb/>reduces inequality (Table 11). This is probably mostly a result of these countries being poorer than the rest <lb/>of Europe but could also be accentuated by the fact that many of these are relatively unequal countries per <lb/></body>

			<body>se. The choice of time period is dictated by the breaks in the data series, but fortunately also coincides with <lb/>the period over which most of the catching-up process is likely to have taken place (mid-1980s to 2000 for <lb/>Southern Europe and from mid-2000s for Eastern Europe). <lb/>The effect of excluding both waves of catching up economies does narrow over time, indicating <lb/>income convergence between Ireland, Portugal and Spain with the rest of the EU from the mid-80s until <lb/>the turn of the century and likewise for the Eastern European countries from the mid-2000s. The latter <lb/>seems to have happened mostly because of the strong income growth in Poland. <lb/>Table 11.

However, this reduces the <lb/>number of observations greatly, so the Gini index is not calculated because of a severe small-sample bias <lb/>(Deltas, 2001). The variance (ratio of standard deviation to mean) in decile income decreased both from <lb/>the mid-1980s to 2000 (though most notably until the mid-1990s), and from the mid-2000s until 2008. This <lb/>reduction in the between component appears to be a pure catching up effect, as the variance increased <lb/>somewhat over the same periods when Spain, Ireland, Portugal and subsequently the East-European <lb/>countries were excluded from the samples. <lb/>4. Conclusions <lb/>Using the OECD inequality and poverty data, this paper shows a general pattern since the mid-1980s <lb/>in European countries at the national level where top deciles capture an increasing part of the income <lb/>generated in the economy, while the poorest 10% are losing ground. A similar evolution has occurred in <lb/>most of the OECD area, including the United States where the rise in top incomes has been particularly <lb/>strong. A few European countries stand out from this pattern, leading to diverging evolutions in income <lb/>dispersion over time where inequality rising in some countries (especially strongly in Sweden and the <lb/>Netherlands), and decreasing in others (Greece and Hungary). There are good reasons why one should <lb/>measure inequality in the European Union not only as a (population weighted) average of inequality in <lb/>each member state, but also for the Union as a whole. While redistribution policies in the European Union <lb/>are mostly under the authority of national governments, EU regional policy is a union-wide policy aiming <lb/>at reducing inequality between regions making it important to assess its potential contribution to <lb/></body>

			<body>inequalities. Concerns for social cohesion in the Union, including inequality, also appear now to be gaining <lb/>momentum. <lb/>Considering inequality in the European Union as a whole allows to see what the differences in income <lb/>growth per decile has implied for inequality between individuals in the European Union, given that in <lb/>parallel to changes in the distribution of income within countries, some economies have grown more <lb/>rapidly than others. Inspired by among others Brandolini (2007) and Milanovic (2002), this paper <lb/>constructed an aggregate measure of EU-wide inequality that takes into account both within and between <lb/>inequality. Inequality in Europe is found to be high, though clearly below the level in the United States. <lb/>Furthermore, EU income inequality is found to have increased over the past 25 years, albeit at a slower <lb/>pace since 2000. <lb/>Evidence of income convergence through the so-called catching up effect was found, which in itself <lb/>should have reduced inequality. Country adhesions over the period, and particularly the expansion to <lb/>Eastern Europe in 2004 did however act in the opposite direction, as both in the mid 1990s and end 2000s <lb/>inequality was higher when the new countries were added. Expansions of the Union is however not the <lb/>only explanation for the rise in income dispersion over the period since inequality also rose within the 8 <lb/>countries in the sample that were part of the European Union in 1985. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX: MICRO-VERSUS MACRO DATA <lb/>National account data only provide national averages, and can therefore only be used to determine the <lb/>difference in mean per capita income between countries, and not within country inequality. Since this <lb/>report aims to measure all income inequality, micro data must necessarily be used. <lb/>A problem with micro data is representativeness. Household surveys cover only a sample of the total <lb/>population and the probability of including the few people that hold a significant part of total household <lb/>income is low. The problem is worsened since the rich have incentives to underreport their income for <lb/>taxation reasons. At the other end of the scale household surveys are also likely to under represent the <lb/>poorest. Two results follow: Using income data from household surveys is likely to lead researchers to <lb/>underestimate the level of inequality and it is likely not to pick up on substantial income growth in the very <lb/>top of the distribution. <lb/>Add to this other conceptual differences beyond the question of sampling and underreporting between <lb/>micro-and macro data and it is no wonder that the growth in total disposable income is different as <lb/>Table A.1 illustrates. Some income components, such as employer social contributions, are accounted for <lb/>in national account data but not included in income data from household surveys. Also, different deflators <lb/>are used for the two data sources to pass from nominal to real income growth. National account data use <lb/>the expenditure price index (Fischer-index) whereas in household survey data the consumer price index <lb/>(Laspeyres-index) is used to deflate income data. In the former the weights assigned to each good are <lb/>updated more frequently to eliminate upper-level substitution bias which means that all else equal it will <lb/>grow slower over time. <lb/>Table A.1. <lb/>Growth in total disposable income, mid 1990s to end 2000s <lb/>Household <lb/>survey data <lb/>National account <lb/>data <lb/>Austria <lb/>1.3 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>Belgium <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>Denmark <lb/>1.1 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>Finland <lb/>2.7 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>France <lb/>1.7 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>Germany <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>Greece <lb/>3.5 <lb/>2.8 <lb/>Ireland <lb/>5.0 <lb/>7.1 <lb/>Italy <lb/>1.0 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>Portugal <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>Spain <lb/>1.8 <lb/>3.4 <lb/>Sweden <lb/>3.0 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>UK <lb/>2.7 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>2.4 <lb/>2.9 <lb/>Hungary <lb/>3.2 <lb/>2.1 <lb/>US <lb/>0.8 <lb/>4.0 <lb/>Source: OECD. <lb/>The difference between the two data sources is particularly large for the United States. Although all <lb/>nominal income components contributed to this, the role of self-employment income has played a key role. <lb/>This income component is likely to be underestimated in survey data, and indeed its growth over time has <lb/>been much stronger according to US macro data. In addition to this government health care social benefits, <lb/></body>

			<body>which are not included in the household income survey data for the United States, have grown rapidly over <lb/>the past decade. <lb/>Applying the income shares of each decile from micro data to total household disposable income from <lb/>macro data gives an indication of how the discrepancy in macro versus micro data income growth affects <lb/>the results in the main paper. The relative orders of magnitude of income growth per decile for a given <lb/>country stay broadly the same as before. However, the fact that income growth per decile across countries <lb/>is now somewhat different from before could make a difference for between-country inequality. <lb/>Such an exercise remains however partial. Scaling up total income by using national account data <lb/>automatically increases absolute dispersions in monetary incomes. However since the evolution in income <lb/>shares remains the same, it is not surprising that the country results are not much changed. Most aggregate <lb/>inequality measures (including the Gini) are scale-invariant, and so per definition the within-country <lb/>component of inequality is not affected. Also, because micro and macro data are so conceptually different, <lb/>one should be vary of using them simultaneously (Deaton, 2005). Finally, there are caveats with national <lb/>accounts data as well, so column two in Table A.1 should not be mistaken for the &quot; true numbers &quot; . <lb/></body>
