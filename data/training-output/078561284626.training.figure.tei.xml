            <figDesc>Market discount rates can also be chosen to reflect the nature of the plan&apos;s liabilities such as the maturity of<lb/> the fund or the extent of benefit indexation. The new funding rules introduced in the United States under<lb/> the 2006 Pension protection Act, for example, require that discount rates are based on the high-quality<lb/> corporate bond yield curve, choosing maturities consistent with the duration of the plan&apos;s liabilities.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>liabilities was<lb/> lowered from 3.25 percent in 2003 to 2.75 percent in 2004 (same as for other pension insurance contracts).<lb/> A further lowering to 2.25 percent is envisaged from 2007 onwards. In Austria, the discount rate was<lb/> lowered to 3.5 percent in 2003. In Finland, the statutory discount rate is being reduced gradually from 4<lb/> percent in 2003 to 3.5 by 2013. Countries where discount rates have not been changed in recent years<lb/> include Spain (4 percent) and Portugal (4.5 percent).<lb/> The move towards market-based valuations has also taken place in countries such as Denmark where<lb/> occupational pensions are DC from an accounting (sponsor) perspective, but the pension funds offer<lb/> minimum return and benefit guarantees. Industry-wide pension funds (and other pension companies 20 )<lb/> have been able to present their account on the basis of fair values since 1 January 2002. Starting on 1<lb/> January 2003, this has been made compulsory. The main features of the Danish market-based approach are<lb/> the use of an adjusted yield curve of euro swap rates to set discount rates 21 , the immediate recognition of<lb/> actuarial gains and losses and the use of current salaries to calculate benefits (CUC method).<lb/> Similarly, in Sweden, the move to market valuation came into force on January 1, 2006 for life<lb/> insurance companies and other insurance undertakings qualifying as institutions for occupational pension<lb/> provision as defined under the EU Directive. The reform to valuations took place together with the<lb/> adoption of the prudent person rule for regulating investments. Starting 1 January 2007, market discount<lb/> rates are set based on an average of government bond yields and swap rates, replacing the current fixed 3<lb/> percent rate (3.5 percent until April 2003).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>in April 2000, while in the United<lb/> Kingdom the new standard FRS17 was introduced in November 2001. The European Council adopted a<lb/> resolution in June 2002 which required all listed companies based in the European Union to comply with<lb/> this IASB accounting standard (and other International Financial Reporting Standards) in the preparation<lb/> of their consolidated group accounts for years commencing on or after 1 January 2005. 23</figDesc>

            <figDesc>International pension accounting standard IAS19<lb/> IAS 19 prescribes the accounting and disclosure rules with respect to employers&apos; benefits, in particular &quot;post-<lb/>employment benefits such as pensions, other retirement benefits, post-employment life insurance and post-<lb/>employment medical care&quot;. Post employment benefits plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or<lb/> defined benefit plans. Under IAS 19 recommendations, unfunded pension benefits are to be recorded, as a general<lb/> rule, as liabilities in the balance sheet of the sponsoring employer. The International Accounting Standards Board<lb/> (IASB) clearly distinguishes two categories: defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans. In defined<lb/> contribution plans, the employer&apos;s annual contribution under the terms of the occupational plan should be recognised<lb/> as an expense. For defined benefit plans, the rule&apos;s most noteworthy aspects are the following:<lb/>  In general, unfunded pension benefits in defined benefit plans should be recorded as a pension liability in<lb/> the employer&apos;s balance sheet (see amortisation rules below). Actuarial gains and losses (including<lb/> investment) can be either (i) immediately recognized in the earnings statement, (ii) not reflected on the<lb/> balance sheet if within a range of 10% of plan assets or obligations (actuarial gains and losses above/below<lb/> this level can be amortised over the working life of employees.), or (iii) immediately recognised in a special,<lb/> below-the-line statement.<lb/>  The projected unit credit method should be used for valuing pension liabilities, as in the PBO measure.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>A new pension accounting standard was also introduced in Australia in January 2006, while in March<lb/> 2007, the Korean Financial Supervisory Commission and the Korea Accounting Institute made a similar<lb/> announcement. Both standards are largely consistent with IAS 19, requiring the recognition of the net<lb/> value of DB pension plans on the company&apos;s balance sheet and changes therein in the profit and loss<lb/> statement. The implications for the Australian pension system, however, are quite limited, as DB pension<lb/> funds represent only a small part of the overall market.</figDesc>
