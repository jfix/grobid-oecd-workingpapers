			<body>The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the OECD, <lb/>the Development Centre or their member countries. <lb/>The Importance of Traditions <lb/>for Development: Why Sometimes <lb/> &quot; Good Enough Is Enough &quot; <lb/>by Johannes Jütting, Denis Drechsler and Indra de Soysa <lb/>In a continent of stranded mobility <lb/>♦ Informal institutions such as traditions, social norms and family structures can help or hinder development. <lb/>♦ Promoting institutional change requires an honest assessment of the local reality and the balance <lb/>between existing formal and informal structures. <lb/>♦ Dealing with traditions may imply counter-intuitive policy options, accepting that sometimes &quot; good <lb/>enough is enough &quot; . <lb/>Sustainable development requires well co-ordinated and <lb/>functioning formal and informal institutions. In developing <lb/>countries, courts, regulations and formal conventions are <lb/>often observed in the breach or fail to function. By default, <lb/>informal institutions – tradition, culture, family structures <lb/>and general social norms – play a crucial role. Trust, <lb/>solidarity and social cohesion make up the tripod of <lb/>community identity which can even promote development, <lb/>as the Nobel Committee recognised by awarding its 2006 <lb/>Peace prize to the micro credit pioneering Grameen Bank <lb/>and its founder Muhammed Yunus. <lb/>Yet, informal institutions are not always conducive to <lb/>development and can sometimes even work against human <lb/>rights. How, then, can we decide which institutions need <lb/>change? How do we accord formal regulations to informal <lb/>institutions? And most importantly, how can we achieve <lb/>institutional change without making matters worse? <lb/>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Sides <lb/>of Institutions <lb/>Institutions are the &quot; rules of the game &quot; . If everybody <lb/>knows and respects them, institutions can reduce <lb/>transaction costs and provide a healthy environment for <lb/>market economies. The Grameen example shows that <lb/>informal institutions can help open credit and insurance <lb/>markets even to the poor. From this it appears that <lb/>societies work best when informal institutions either <lb/>accommodate or complement formal ones; in the <lb/>Grameen Bank case the formal credit system relies <lb/>o n p e e r-p re s s u r e e n for c e d b y t h e i n fo r m a l <lb/>institutional setting. <lb/>Solidarity based on kinship structures, family assistance <lb/>and social capital often is the cornerstone of non-state <lb/>social security systems in developing countries. Credit <lb/>and saving groups in Latin America, community-based <lb/>health insurance schemes in South Asia and funeral <lb/>associations in Sub-Saharan Africa bear testimony to <lb/>the organisational variety of such systems. <lb/>Some institutions, however, can also impede economic <lb/>growth and social development. The same set of <lb/>institutions that constitute the basis of informal social <lb/>security, for example, can turn out to be a &quot; tax on <lb/>success&apos;&apos;. A hard-working farmer in Benin who has <lb/>accumulated some wealth over the years often has to <lb/>share the fruit of his labours with his enlarged family, <lb/>including distant relatives. Family pressure obliges him <lb/>to pay school fees for his nieces and nephews or the <lb/>health costs if anyone in his entourage gets sick. This <lb/>can heavily distort incentives to work and diminish the <lb/>capital base for future investment. <lb/>While these examples focus on economic effects, other <lb/>informal institutions, such as forced marriages and <lb/>female genital mutilation, severely violate human rights. <lb/>Promoting social justice, gender equality and human <lb/>rights often implies changing centuries-old traditions. <lb/>No. 14 <lb/></body>

Changing those that violate human rights is not a <lb/>choice but a moral obligation. The tricky part of institutional <lb/>change is to identify correctly those institutions that are <lb/>conducive to development and those that may be harmful. <lb/>Solving this puzzle always depends on the specific country <lb/>context. Social pressure to accommodate even distant family <lb/>members, for example, is a form of forced solidarity and in <lb/>certain circumstances is a valuable form of welfare. At the <lb/>same time, such practices can replace more efficient <lb/>arrangements and lead to exploitation of the host. <lb/>Similarly, trying to eliminate corruption in environments <lb/>with strong patronage-based power and redistribution <lb/>mechanisms without addressing the root problems can do <lb/>more harm than good and might even lead to violent <lb/>conflicts about new resource sharing. Changing laws alone, <lb/>without proper enforcement mechanisms, might pose even <lb/>higher costs for the alleged beneficiaries. In Pakistan, for <lb/>example, women may place their lives in danger by <lb/>reporting rape cases under the new Women&apos;s Protection <lb/>Bill. For poor rural women it might be very difficult to <lb/>provide the necessary evidence that leads to an <lb/>investigation. If the complainant can not sufficiently prove <lb/>her case, then she risks traditional punishment. Introducing <lb/>legal change to improve gender equality needs effective <lb/>enforcement and a gradual change of male attitudes; <lb/>otherwise it is bound to be ineffective or even <lb/>counterproductive. <lb/>Changing a country&apos;s institutional system and tinkering with <lb/>its balance is a delicate affair that needs to be done with <lb/>caution and sometimes against common reform dogma. <lb/>Policies that worked in one country may very well fail in <lb/>another and are rarely optimal elsewhere. &quot; Think globally, <lb/>act locally &quot; , therefore, no longer seems a valid motto, at <lb/>least in the context of institutions. <lb/>If we fail to understand the mind sets of people and the <lb/>incentive structures that govern their behaviour, we will <lb/>not be able to bring about changes promoted at the national <lb/>or supra-national level. This holds true for conflict <lb/>resolution, gender equality, investment promotion and good <lb/>governance. We should be wary of absolute answers, best <lb/>practices and blueprints of how to achieve development. <lb/>Rather, we need to accept that some times &quot; good enough <lb/>is enough &quot; . <lb/>✲ ✲ ✲ <lb/>Informal Institutions and Development, an international <lb/>seminar organised by the OECD Development Centre and <lb/>the Development Assistance Committee in Paris on <lb/>11-12 December 2006. </body>
