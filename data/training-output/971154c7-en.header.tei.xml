	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Business registration is crucial for ensuring accountable, transparent and viable business environments.<lb/> By bringing businesses into the formal economy, governments are able to provide more strategic and<lb/> targeted policies for businesses and consumers. The objective of this working paper is to look at the<lb/> importance of business registration for governments, businesses and citizens. It explores the this issue<lb/> through a series of case studies that support good practices in customer orientation and joined-up<lb/> government. Each of the different case studies fall under a pillar that aims to support countries in the<lb/> development of their business registration systems.<lb/> The paper also aims to provide policy directions for countries in Southeast Asia when developing<lb/> modern business registration systems and provides some background for the development of ASEAN&apos;s<lb/> regional business registration principles.<lb/> JEL classification: D01, D21, D22, D73, H1, H32, L2, M13, N85, N80<lb/></div>
