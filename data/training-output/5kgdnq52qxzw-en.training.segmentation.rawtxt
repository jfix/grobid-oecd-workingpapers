OECD Secretariat The pattern of trade analysed from a factor content perspective reflects the relative 
factor endowments of the countries examined. Although some large economies, such as 
the United States, seem to exhibit counter-intuitive behaviour, this is reversed when 
intermediate trade is taken into account. We argue this is a reflection of the changing 
nature of production processes and trade. The evidence presented here implies factor 
endowments are undergoing changes that call for careful analysis of the measures 
commonly used in trade. Acknowledging the role of intermediate goods to understand a 
country's factor content trade position is one step. Additionally, one must account for the 
interaction between the domestic determination of employment and wages with 
international movement of goods and services, and location of tasks. Key words: Factor content, comparative advantage, intermediate inputs, wages. JEL Classification: F0, F14, F20 Acknowledgements This study was prepared by Susan Stone, Ricardo Cavazos and Anna Jankowska

OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Executive Summary The results of this study show that overall trade patterns reflect the relative factor 
endowments of the countries under investigation. That is, OECD countries have larger 
stocks of capital and skilled labour and show relatively intensive use of these factors in 
their traded goods and services. Selected Emerging Markets (SEMs) have large stocks of 
unskilled labour and show strong trade surpluses in goods and services using this resource 
intensively. In this sense, we show that factor content of trade, as measured via factor 
services, provides useful insights into trade patterns, as predicted by neoclassical trade 
theory. However, some large economies, such as the United States and Japan, exhibit 
counter-intuitive results as illustrated by large factor content of trade surpluses in 
unskilled labour for Japan and deficits in the capital-content of trade for the United States. 
Accounting for intermediate trade in our analysis reverses some of these seemingly 
counter-intuitive results, and in general has a large impact on measured factor content. 
We argue that this is a reflection of the changing nature of trade, driven by the forces of 
production fragmentation and offshoring. We contend that these trends reflect a shift 
away from thinking of trade in terms of domestically-based factor (i.e. labour or capital) 
content, to thinking of trade in terms of internationally mobile tasks required to produce 
output. The evidence presented here implies that factor content patterns are undergoing 
fundamental changes calling for more careful analysis of the broad measures used in 
trade. Trade patterns are now just as reliant on the cost of moving goods and tasks, as 
they are on the particular endowment structure of an economy. Finally we find little evidence that the changes in trade patterns have had a significant 
impact on relative wages, or wage inequality, in the time period examined. We speculate 
that domestic considerations, and the growing influence of tasks as opposed to 
endowments, play a larger role in determining these outcomes. This is an important 
finding that argues against the imposition of trade barriers in an attempt to influence 
either wages or levels of employment, and in favour of pursuing targeted labour market 
policies that would accommodate, rather than hinder, the process of adjustments, 
including in the aftermath of trade reforms. Another implication of this work for policy makers is the need to be aware that the 
methods used to derive the value for trade balances matter. Those values based on 
traditional approaches are more of a reflection of historical investments and could lead to 
‗lagging' policy advice, based on past behaviour, rather than the forward looking advice 
needed to steer an economy into the future. Acknowledging the role of intermediate goods in understanding a country's trade 
position is only the first step. What remains a challenge for policy makers is the need to 
reconcile the seemingly opposing trends of the domestic (i.e. geographic specific) 
determination of employment and wages with the international (i.e. non-geographic 
specific) determination of the movement of goods and services and location of tasks. 
Thus policy makers should appreciate the limits of using trade policy to influence THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 5 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 domestic issues. Rather they should implement proactive measures– such as greater 
investment in resource markets through training and education and ensuring well 
functioning capital markets – that create an environment conducive to taking full 
advantage of these trends. I. 
Introduction The global economy is entering a new era characterised by a rise in new trade power-
houses (such as China) and intensifying competition for new consumer and product 
markets (such as Asia and renewable energy, respectively). Indeed, there are a growing 
number of economists who argue that the nature of international trade is changing in 
fundamental ways (Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2010). Thus, it is argued that in an 
integrated global market, trade is increasingly about intermediates goods and services. 
Simultaneously, concern remains over the impacts of globalisation including excessive 
market volatility, increased vulnerability to crises, and the perceived ability of low-wage 
producers to disrupt domestic labour markets. Calls to ―manage‖ globalisation remain and 
are unlikely to subside in the context of the current economic uncertainty and stalled 
DDA talks. Understanding the fundamental forces behind observed trading patterns has generally 
been undertaken through what international economic theory would describe as a 
realisation of comparative advantage; a country exports those goods in which it has a 
relative cost advantage vis a vis its trading partners. This concept has powerful policy 
implications in that from it stems the basic reasoning that free trade policies are superior 
to interventionist trade practices. 1 However, comparative advantage evolves for a host of 
reasons, including endowment structure, technology and the institutional landscape of 
both domestic and international commerce. That is, comparative advantage can be 
influenced by domestic policies in the trading countries themselves as well as those in 
their trading partners. It is not a static concept; it influences, and is influenced by, policy 
as well as stages of economic development and evolution (Balassa 1979). This interaction 
provides an interesting and complex context for an empirical study on patterns of 
specialisation and comparative advantage and underlying policy implications for OECD 
and non-OECD countries alike. As per the original scoping paper, The Effects of Globalisation: Openness and 
Changing Patterns of Comparative Advantage (OECD internal document), the project is 
structured to deliver four consecutive reports, which will constitute its principal direct 
outputs: 
 Production, Consumption and Trade Developments.  Comparative Advantage and Export Specialisation Mobility in OECD and Selected 
Emerging Market Economies. 
 Have Changes in Factor Endowments been reflected in Trade Patterns and What Effect 
has this had on Relative Wages? 
 Comparative Advantage and Trade Performance: Policy Implications. 1. 
The gains from an open trading regime have been well documented in the literature. Trade 
liberalisation and productivity links have been confirmed in a wide range of empirical studies and 
reviews include Bernard et al. (2007) and Nordas et al. (2006). 6 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 This paper presents the analysis completed under the third instalment of the project 
examining comparative advantage from the perspective of factor services embodied in 
traded outputs. It takes a closer look at the underlying forces in factor markets and how 
they potentially drive Comparative Advantage. The paper begins with a discussion of the factor content theory of comparative 
advantage and briefly reviews the empirical literature examining factor content of trade 
within this framework. It then moves to a review of the trends in resource accumulation 
and utilisation among OECD and selected non–OECD economies, focusing on capital 
and labour. The fourth section examines relative resource use and, relationship to 
endowments and trade. We then apply these insights to the matter of relative wages with 
an analysis of how the identified trends in productivity, resource endowments and trade 
have played a role in changes in relative wages. The final section offers some conclusions 
and areas of policy relevance. II. The Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international trade The Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international trade states that comparative advantage 
is derived from differences in relative factor endowments across countries and relative 
intensities with which factors are used across sectors. 2 A country will have an advantage, 
vis a vis other countries, in producing goods in those sectors which use factors it holds in 
relative abundance. Vanek (1968) formalised the link between factors used in the 
production of a country's goods and services and its trade by comparing the relationship 
between those factors embodied in a country's production versus those embodied in its 
consumption. This has become known as Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model of 
international trade. The HOV model has been subject to extensive empirical scrutiny with an uneven 
record of success. The problem is that the lack of a clearly differentiated framework 
relating endowments and trade makes it impossible to test HOV against a well-specified 
alternative. Thus, researchers have been focusing on what version of a constantly 
evolving HOV model best fits the data. Starting with Leontief (1953) through Trefler 
(1995), HOV failed most major empirical challenges. 3 Trefler (1995) found that the 
measured net factor content of trade using a HOV framework is essentially zero, calling 
this the ―case of the missing trade‖. He then develops a specification that allows for home 
bias in consumption and international technology differences and the model successfully 
fits the data. However Gabaix (1997) showed that this improved model is based on a set 
of carefully chosen specifications and when the estimated parameters are tested to see if 
they successfully reconcile the predicted with the measured factor content of trade, no 
real improvement is observed. Work following Trefler began to focus on why HOV models performed so badly. 
Measurement error tended to be the most common explanation – factors are not well 
defined or are not captured well enough in the value of trade (Fisher and Marshall 2008); 
significant aggregation bias existed in measures of trade used (Feenstra and Hanson 
2000); incorrect assumptions were being made regarding returns to scale (Antweiler and 2. 
The model was originally formulated by Heckscher (1919) and further developed by Ohlin (1933) 
and formalised by Samuelson through a series of papers between 1948 and 1953. The model is 
often also referred to as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model. 3. 
For an extensive review of empirical studies during this period see Leamer and Levinsohn (1995). THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 7 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Trefler 2002) and difference in technology (early examples include Trefler and Zhu 2000, 
Hakura 2001 and Davis and Weinstein 2001). Romalis (2004) showed that transport costs 
and monopolistic competition are important determinants of the structure of trade and 
need to be incorporated into the HOV framework. In the end, what this body of work 
showed was that by improving specifications and including more realistic elements of 
trade, the HOV framework performs well. One of the most active areas of investigation has been testing the HOV assumptions 
regarding technology. A country's technology matrix is a measure of the units of inputs – 
both primary inputs such as labour and capital and intermediate inputs that are produced 
outputs of an industry – that are required to produce each unit of output, thus is an 
indication of the technology, or production method, used within each sector in an 
economy. Many early empirical studies had relied on one technology matrix (usually the 
United States) measuring primary inputs only. Later studies made adjustments for 
potential differences in the United States and ―other‖ potential technology matrices but 
these were based on estimated deviations from a US base. A study by Hakura (2001) is an 
example of an early attempt to use directly observed technology matrices. By utilising 
four OECD country matrices, this paper found significant improvement in the model's 
performance. However, this does not provide a ―test‖ of any hypothesis of underlying 
production (matrices fit the model as a matter of construction), and raised the question as 
to how differences in these technology matrices occurred and if they systematically 
related to fundamental characteristics (i.e. endowment structures) of countries in the 
trading system (Davis and Weinstein 2001). 
With the publication of the OECD's Input-Output tables, the academic community 
―… dramatically improved our ability to test trade theory‖ (Davis and Weinstein 2001). 
Using these tables Davis and Weinstein found that allowing for Hicks-neutral 
productivity differences, industry input usage strongly correlated with country factor 
abundance, which had not held in conventional HOV model tests to date. 4 However, once 
again, this modification was relative to a base technology matrix. 
Davis and Weinstein (2003) observe that the study of factor content has ―become a 
laboratory to test‖ ideas about how the elements of endowments, production, 
consumption and trade fit together in a general equilibrium framework. They suggest that 
while great progress has been made, a deeper consideration of intermediates inputs, 
demand side issues (i.e. the differences in patterns of total domestic consumption of final 
goods and services by a country, otherwise known as ―absorption‖), and the role of 
aggregation biases is needed. This last point is echoed in Feenstra and Hanson (2000) 
who found significant evidence that the factor content of exports differs systemically 
from domestic production and that as disaggregation increases, the factor content of skill 
intensity in US trade rises. Reimer (2006) and Trefler and Zhu (2010) are two attempts to 
directly include traded intermediate inputs into the picture. In the end, the HOV framework properly measured, has been shown to successfully 
explain trade patterns through differences in factor scarcities, or on the flip side, factor 
abundance, between economies. Thus, for our purposes, it remains a useful framework 
for measurement and analysis. It is not the goal of this paper to reconcile theoretical 
predictions from the model – there exists a wide body of literature having already done 
this. Rather, we use this framework to examine measures of factor content across a 4 
A Hicks neutral technology change refers to a change that affects both capital and labour in the same 
way. 8 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 variety of OECD and non-OECD economies, carefully incorporating improvements in the 
specifications of the model identified in the literature. Before we undertake an analysis of factor content of trade, however, we review the 
trends in country's underlying endowment structure. III. Trends in factor endowments This section examines trends in accumulation of capital and labour and compares 
changes in stocks with changes in the utilisation of these factors in goods and services 
over time across OECD and Accession countries 5 (here after referred to as OECD), as 
well as several Selected Emerging Markets (SEMs). 6 Relative factor endowments There is wide variation both within and between the OECD and SEM groupings in 
their relative endowments of capital and labour, as can be seen through measures of 
variation. For OECD countries, the coefficient of variation for capital is 25.5% while it is 
only 4.5% for labour, indicating a great disparity in capital stocks than labour stocks in 
the region. SEMs show greater dissimilarity for both measures – 43.1% for capital and 
15.5% for labour – but the same higher values for capital than labour. The OECD area is capital abundant, accounting for 80% of the capital available 
among these countries in 2005. 7 The largest capital stocks are found in the United States 
and Japan, followed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Korea and Italy 
(Figure A1). Capital stocks grew at an average per annum rate of 4.5% in the OECD as a 
whole during the 1990-2005 period (Table A1), with the highest per annum growth rates 
in Chile (10.4%) and Korea (7.7%). By comparison, in the SEM area capital is relatively 
scarce. These countries held roughly 20% of total capital measured in 2005 with the 
largest capital stocks held by China, India, and Brazil (Figure A1). China shows an 
especially rapid accumulation in capital stocks in the period 1995-2005 with a per annum 
rate of 11.5%, followed by India with a rate of 9.2%. Stocks of capital in the SEM area 
overall grew at a rate of 8.3% per annum, outpacing growth in the OECD. Conversely, labour is relatively abundant in the SEM area, which accounts for 
roughly 70% of labour in the total sample. Within the OECD area, the largest stocks of 
labour are found in the United States and Japan (Figure A2). The largest stocks in the 
SEMs are in China, India and Indonesia (Figure A2). As with capital, labour stock grew 
at disparate rates across these two groupings during the 1990-2005 period. In the OECD 5. 
The Accession grouping originally pertained to Chile, Estonia, Israel, Russia and Slovenia. Chile 
formally became a member of the OECD on 7 May 2010 and Estonia, Israel and Slovenia were 
invited to join 10 May 2010. 6. 
SEMs include the five enhanced engagement economies (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and 
South Africa) as well as Argentina, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Singapore, and 
Egypt where data is available. 7 
This is a share of the total capital stocks for the 38 countries for which data is available. Data was 
not available for Poland, Turkey, the Slovak Republic, and the Czech Republic. The net capital 
stocks are calculated from real GFCF series from the World Bank WDI. See data annex for 
calculation details. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 9 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 area the labour pool grew at a rate of 0.60% per annum while the SEMs increased at the 
considerably faster annual rate of 2.1% (Table A1). Decomposing by skill level reveals further differences in labour force characteristics 
between the OECD area and SEMs (Figures A 3 and 4). 8 Overall, the 2005 total labour 
force breaks down into a 10% share of skilled workers 9 , and 90% share of unskilled 
workers. The OECD countries accounted for 56% of total skilled labour force, while the 
SEMs held the remaining 44%. Stocks of skilled labour increased in the OECD area at a 
per annum rate of 3.3% between 1990-2005; more slowly than the SEMS rate of 4.8% 
per year in the same period. India and China held the bulk of the skilled labour stocks 
among the SEMs. 
The OECD's share of unskilled labour was 25%, while the SEMs accounted for the 
remaining 75%. Unskilled labour stocks grew at a rate of 0.53% per annum in the OECD 
area, only a third as fast as the rate of 1.7% per annum in SEMs during the 1990-2005 
period. The US holds the largest stocks among the OECD countries while China and 
India dominate the SEMs (Figure A4). Thus while OECD countries continue to hold 
larger stocks of capital and skilled labour endowments, SEMs accumulation rates are 
much higher for both, indicating that relative abundance may be changing over time. This 
is especially true in capital and skilled labour and dominated by China and India. As discussed in Section II, to understand how endowments play a role in a country's 
trade composition, it is important to understand the way these factors are used. Thus, we 
look at changes in the amount of capital per worker across these economies. The ratio of 
capital stock per worker (k/l) provides a direct comparison of factor abundance. 10 Figure 
A5 shows the k/l ratios for two selected groupings of OECD countries. 11 In line with 
observed changes in stocks of capital, k/l increased in all OECD countries, except Mexico 
between 1990 and 2005. The highest values of k/l ratios corresponded to the countries 
with the largest capital stocks; the United States and Japan (with Japan dominating) and 
the largest increases in the k/l ratio in occurred in Chile and Korea (Figure A5). By comparison (Figure A5), the capital per worker ratios in SEMs are small, 
reflecting the smaller capital base relative to labour abundance in this grouping. Only 
Argentina and Malaysia fall within a k/l range comparable to some OECD countries. The 
k/l ratios in SEMs have remained relatively stable during the 1980-2005 period in China, 
Indonesia, and India, while decreasing over time in Brazil. The largest increases in value 
of k/l ratio occurred in Argentina, Malaysia and Thailand. 8. 
The data for workforce by education level and gender comes from the IIASA and Vienna Institute 
for Demography data sets for 1970-1995 and 2000-2050, further details on about these datasets can 
be found in the data annex. 9. 
Skilled workers are those who have completed tertiary education. 10. 
Labour ratios are taken from the same source as labour stocks reported above. That is, the working 
age population (15+) from the IIASA/VID Human Capital and Economic Growth Program. This 
measure includes all available human capital, and does not distinguish economically active 
population from those who do not participate. The same ratios were constructed using figures for 
economically active labour force from the World Bank World Development Indicators, and the 
resulting ratios demonstrated similar trends. 11. 
For ease of discussion, we show only selected OECD countries. For a complete table of ratios can be 
found in the data annex. 10 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 According to the HOV framework, these relative endowments are a major 
determinant of economic activity in which countries will have a comparative advantage. 
While the above analysis provides an indication of stocks of endowments available within 
a country, it does not tell us how, or how much, of these stocks are actually utilised in 
production. While standard HOV assumes full employment, (i.e. all stocks are fully 
employed), we know this does not hold true, especially in specific periods of time. Thus, 
to get an idea of how much capital and labour are used in the production process, we 
examine their share in value added. To focus on the amount of capital being put in place, 
we look at investment in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) as a share of value added 
and examine the role of labour in production by looking at the ratio of total wage bill to 
value added. 12 13 The GFCF and total wage bill to value added ratios for all OECD countries and 
SEMs 14 are shown in Figures A A6 and A7, respectively. These figures present the 
average and standard deviation of the two measures for all countries for the 1988-2005 
period as well as several sub-periods. 15 The figures depict opposing trends in the shares of 
capital and labour to value added in total manufacturing with the mean share of capital to 
value added increasing while the labour share declines slightly across periods. This 
outcome implies that the capital intensity of manufacturing production increased across 
the dataset. The overall increase in the divergence of the GFCF to value added ratio, as 
measured by its standard deviation, comes mainly from the large increase in the post-
1997 time period. Prior to that, the deviations among countries appear to have been 
declining. While a part of this finding can be attributed to an increase in country coverage 
in the later period, the basic observation of an increase in the divergence of capital 
utilisation across the economies examined holds. The increasing mean of capital as a 
share of value added is in line with the growth of capital stocks observed across both 
regions during this period. Conversely, the mean wage bill to value added ratio decreased over the period. This 
result is partially explained by the larger growth in value added in manufacturing relative 
to the total wage bill but also is in line with trends in production fragmentation utilizing 
an increasingly diverse pool of cheaper labour in Eastern European OECD and Emerging 
Markets, as well as the decline in manufacturing employment overall in OECD area (Pilat 
et. al, 2006). The next section examines factor intensity of utilisation in manufacturing 
across the two country groupings. 12. 
An alternative measure of capital used in the production process is to take the residual of the wage 
bill/value added ratio, or 1-(wage bill/VA). However, as the mirror reflection of the wage bill share, 
it provides little additional information about changing investment in fixed capital. Thus GFCF was 
chosen as a better available capital proxy in measuring the factor's intensity in production. However, 
we use GFCF/VA as a broad indication of the capital usage across all manufacturing activity within 
an economy and thus it will not capture the expansion or contraction of capital in any particular 
industry. 13. 
We also calculated these ratios using units instead of values, applying price indices for capital, 
labour and output. This yielded no qualitative difference in the results. 14. 
The countries in this grouping include Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, 
Indonesia, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand and Vietnam. 15. 
Periods were chosen to reflect economic breaks, i.e. the recession in 1991and the Asian Financial 
Crisis in 1997. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 11 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Trends in factor utilisation in OECD countries Within the OECD grouping, the average share of capital in value-added (VA) during 
the 1988-2005 period was 14.5%, and on average has been declining at an annual rate of -
0.97% (Figure A6). 16 Driving this average decline is the fact that growth in GFCF is 
outpacing value added growth in several OECD countries, for example in Mexico, 
Iceland, Australia, Poland, New Zealand, the Slovak Republic and Hungary. The largest 
decreases in the overall ratio are observed in Korea and Finland, but decreases were also 
evident in other member countries including the Netherlands, France, Austria, Belgium, 
Sweden, Canada, and Ireland. The faster growth in GFCF is not surprising given the 
changes in economic structure that occurred in Eastern Europe during this period (i.e. the 
transition to a market based economy in Poland), and the large investment program that 
occurred in Iceland. 17 Several trends explain the extent to which the overall decrease in capital intensity in 
manufacturing in OECD countries appears to be inconsistent with the observed increases 
in capital stocks per worker in these countries. First, the capital intensity numbers apply 
only to the manufacturing sector, where the k/l ratios are reported across all economic 
activity. We know that services are an increasingly important part of overall economic 
activity, including trade, in many OECD economies. 18 To the extent that this sector has an 
increasing k/l ratio, one would expect this to influence the overall k/l ratios reported for 
these economies. Second, to the extent economies with large k/l ratios dominate reported 
value added totals in the OECD groupings, they will again, unduly influence observed 
outcomes (e.g. the contribution of the United States versus that of Hungary). Finally, the 
deviation in the trends of stock accumulation and utilisation may be due to the relative 
maturity of, and decreasing investment in, certain segments of manufacturing as 
identified in Interim Report 1. 19 Figure A7 shows the trends in total wage bill in manufacturing as a share of value 
added across the economies under examination during this period. The average of the 
wage bill to value added ratio was 43%, although values for OECD countries in 2005 
ranged from a low of 12% in Chile to a high of 65% in Denmark. Growth rate 
calculations show a decline in the ratio at an average annual rate of -0.34%, with the 
largest decreases in Japan, Korea, and Canada. This is primarily a reflection of the faster 
growth rates in value added compared with wages across most OECD economies (with 
the notable exception of Poland). The relatively small share of wage bill to value added in 
Japan may be a reflection of its relatively (as shown above) high share of unskilled 
workers (Figure A4). 20 The decrease in the wage bill to value added is consistent with 
employment decreases in this sector as labour moved away from manufacturing toward 
services and other sectors in the economy (Pilat et al. 2006). The exceptions to this trend 
are Luxembourg, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, France, Spain and the Russian 
Federation. 16.

OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Capital and labour utilisation in selected emerging markets GFCF to value added ratios for total manufacturing in SEMs are presented in 
Figure A6. Increased investment activity and expansion of the manufacturing sector in 
many of these countries is demonstrated by the three times larger average share of GFCF 
to value added relative to the OECD country grouping. The average ratio is 49.3% with 
an annual growth rate across these economies in excess of 11%. This growth trend 
however, was not consistent throughout the SEMs. There appears to be a decline during 
this period in India, Malaysia and Thailand. At the other extreme, China, Indonesia, and 
Egypt experienced rapid growth in investment activity leading to GFCF to VA ratios over 
100%. Wage bill to value added ratios (Figure A7) varied considerably across the SEM 
grouping with Bangladesh and South Africa at the high end of the spectrum and China at 
the low end. The larger ratios in the case of Bangladesh and South Africa were primarily 
due to lower value added figures for manufacturing rather than to particularly high wage 
bills. Wages to value added over the 1990-2005 time period averaged 24% and decreased 
on average at a rate of -1.5% per annum. Significant differences are observed across 
countries with decreases in India, South Africa, Egypt, and Singapore while Argentina, 
Thailand, Malaysia and Bangladesh experienced an increase. The relative volatility of 
values in this area indicates that changes in factor utilisations were occurring rapidly. The 
decreasing share of Wage Bill in value added is, in part, a reflection of the increasing 
capital intensity of manufacturing production in SEMs during this period. This is despite 
the large increase in the stock of labour in the region. As value added increases across 
most of these country's manufacturing sector and increasing labour stocks put downward 
pressure on wages, we would expect to see a further decline in the overall ratio. This section has shown that while the OECD countries have larger stocks of capital 
and skilled labour, SEMs are accumulating these factors at a faster rate. We also see that 
as a whole, capital per worker is increasing in the OECD while it remains flat across 
many SEMs. This apparently inconsistent outcome could be due to the changing nature of 
the output in the two regional groupings and the rapid accumulation of both resources in 
the SEMs. As many OECD economies increase their output in services, they are adding 
increasing amounts of investment to this sector thus influencing the overall capital to 
labour ratios reported and potentially offsetting declining shares of capital formation in 
value added in manufacturing. Also potentially influencing these results is the relative 
change in demand for labour. For instance, in the OECD context, sectors that employ 
(unskilled) workers and are capital-intensive (such as construction and light 
manufacturing) are growing more slowly – or even contracting – shedding labour at a 
faster rate than capital, thus raising the k/l ratio. Other sectors, such as services, which are 
increasing their demand for (skilled) labour, are also adding invested capital, thus 
influencing the overall increase in capital intensity observed here. We do observe, 
however, that these patterns are not uniform across all OECD economies with more 
newly industrialised members (such as Poland and Hungary) showing increasing shares 
of capital in manufacturing value added. Across the SEMs we observe increasing stocks of both capital and labour and this is 
reflected in the relatively flat k/l ratios over the period. The shares of capital and labour in 
value added varies across country and time, reflecting the relative changes in value added, 
wages and returns to capital, thus complicating any straightforward conclusions to be 
drawn from the underlying changes observed in capital and labour stocks. Next we THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 13 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 explore relative productivity of labour in order gain further insights into what these 
changes in factor availability and utilisation imply for economic performance. Productivity In order to provide a broad consistent measure of labour productivity across the 
economy as a whole, we look at output per worker, (using GDP as a proxy for output). 21 
Productivity within and between the OECD and SEM country groupings vary widely (see 
Figure A8). Among OECD countries, the highest ratios of output per worker are found in 
Luxembourg, Norway, Japan and the United States. At the lower end of the spectrum, we 
find newer Eastern European member states, Turkey and Chile. During the 1990-2005 
period, output per worker across the OECD increased at an average per annum rate of 
1.5% (Figure A8). In SEMs, labour productivity remains significantly lower on average, with the 
exceptions of Hong Kong and Singapore (Figure A8). Despite this considerably lower 
base, productivity growth rates indicate that this is changing rapidly, at an average per 
annum rate of 4.2%, nearly three times faster than the OECD area. The growth was not, 
however, consistent throughout the grouping. Output per worker declined in Brazil and 
South Africa during this period. This comparison underscores the importance of taking into account how factors are 
utilized and differences in technology of production in order to better understand how 
factor abundance influences a country's comparative advantage. For example, it has been 
shown that labour productivity increases with capital investment. 22 Thus, the fast growth 
rates of labour productivity in SEMs may be a product of the rapid increase in capital 
formation in these economies observed here. To see how these various, often competing 
forces, have played out in trade patterns, we now turn to examining the measured factor 
content of trade. IV. Measuring factor content Total endowment stocks have been growing across both OECD and SEMs, with 
SEMs experiencing faster growth across the board. Within the OECD, skilled labour 
stocks grew 6.5 times faster than unskilled while the SEMs skilled labour growth rate 
exceeded its unskilled rate at a slower rate (2.7 times). We also observe diminishing wage 
bill to value added ratio, on average, across the OECD in manufacturing and a rise in 
SEMs. However, as stated, this trend more likely reflects a decline in the value added in 
manufacturing among OECD countries as a whole rather than an absolute decline in 
labour usage. Indeed, labour productivity continues to grow at a robust rate among OECD 
countries, especially in Korea, Estonia and Poland. There was also strong productivity 
growth in China and Vietnam among the SEMs. We now look to see how these trends are 
reflected in trade patterns. 21. 
Real GDP measures and total labour force were taken from the World Bank World Development 
Indicators (2010). 22. 
There is a vast literature on the relationship between capital and labour productivity. See, for 
instance, Romer (1990). 14 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 We begin our construction of the factor content of trade with the simple HOV model: w 
i 
i 
i 
i V 
s 
V 
AT 
F 
 
 
 (1) 
The first expression on the right hand side represents the standard HO specification: 
the factor content of i's trade (F i ) is a function of the inputs used (A) times the country's 
net exports T i . The final expression comes from Vanek (1968), who showed that the 
measure of factor content should equal an economy's measure of factor abundance. In 
this expression, V i is a measure of factor endowments in country i, V w is the measure of world endowments and s i is the share of country i in world consumption. So, for example, 
if a country is relatively abundant in labour, the factor content of trade would be positive 
as the excess of what is produced with the country's labour supply, over what is 
consumed of labour-intensive goods, is exported. Conversely, if a country is relatively 
scarce in labour, the value would be negative, as it consumes a greater share of the 
world's labour endowment. As pointed out in Trefler and Zhu (2010), the past decade has witnessed an 
―explosion‖ of research into the impact of international technology differences on 
measuring the factor content of trade. However, they argue that this literature has failed to 
properly account for differences in international technology and address the pivotal issue 
of traded intermediate inputs. They put forth a theoretical model which does both, 
providing a complete characterisation of the class of models that are implied by the 
Vanek prediction of factor content of trade. This section relies upon this model to 
construct a measure of factor content that is theoretically consistent and accounts for both 
technological differences across country's production processes while explicitly including 
trade in intermediate goods. The work presented here makes two major advancements over these existing 
measures of factor content. First, as in Trefler and Zhu (2010), we rely on individual 
countries' technology matrices rather than the existing approach of using a single matrix 
adjusted for production technology differentials. We then apply a definition of factor 
content that measures the amount of factors used worldwide to produce a country's trade 
flows, and we apply this across a set of five factors of production, including a breakout of 
skilled and unskilled labour. Thus we construct a more complete factor requirements 
matrix for a country's trade by allowing for differentiated production processes including 
those inputs used in producing intermediate inputs overseas (Deardorff, 1982). Finally, 
we apply this approach to different time periods to observe how the factor content of 
trade has changed. By comparing the equations derived without directly accounting for 
intermediate inputs with those that do, we can analyse the role of intermediate inputs in 
trade and the determination of a country's comparative advantage. 23 Data To implement this approach, it is important we have access to input-output data for as 
complete and consistent a set of countries as possible. While the OECD input-output 
tables are a consistent and up-to-date set of information, they cover only a few countries 
outside the OECD and are limited in their factor input coverage. The GTAP database also 
provides a consistent measure of trade flows and input data but covers a larger number of 23. 
See the Technical Appendix for a more detailed explanation of our approach to measuring factor 
content. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 15 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 countries globally, as well as a breakdown of skilled and unskilled labour. 24 We use three 
versions of the database, namely GTAP versions 5, 6 and 7 which correspond to base 
years of 1997, 2001 and 2004, respectively. The input-output tables contain five primary 
factors of production: land, unskilled labour, skilled labour, capital and natural resources. 
Land is defined in GTAP as an agriculture-specific resource and is used only in 
production in these sectors. Natural resources are associated with extraction industries 
and are a factor input for the sectors fishery, forestry, coal, oil, gas and other mining. 
Labour is divided into skilled and unskilled based on the International Labour 
Organisations (ILO) classification. 25 How has factor usage within a country changed over time? As discussed in Section III, capital utilisation has increased and overall labour 
productivity rates rose over the 1990 – 2005 time period, especially in the emerging 
OECD and SEM economies. In this section, we apply the factor content of trade 
definition to explore the relative uses of these factor endowments and how they have 
changed over time. 
To examine a country's relative factor abundance, that is each endowment relative to 
other endowments within a country, at a point in time, we normalise each factor by its 
content in consumption and compare across the various factors (Muriel and Terra, 2009). 
For example, the content of skilled labour in net exports is higher (lower) than the factor 
content of capital if skilled labour is relatively more abundant (less abundant), when the 
factor contents are normalised by domestic consumption. We can also restate these 
values, measuring factor abundance by income rather than consumption, adjusting the 
value to take account of the trade balance as in Bowen and Sveikaukas (1992). Both 
measures provide a relative value for factor abundance with respect to other factors 
within a single country. 26 We calculate these relative values for each country in the sample for the three time 
periods: namely 1997, 2001 and 2004 and rank the factors to determine the relative 
abundance as revealed by the country's trade position, and examine how this has changed 
over time. The relative factor abundance values and their rankings are presented for 
OECD and SEM countries in Tables A2 and A3, respectively. 27 The two tables present three pieces of information: (1) the calculated factor 
abundance measure for each of the five resources, relative to the other resources within 
each country; (2) the rankings for each of these factors of production relative to the other 
factors for each of the three years; and (3) the standard deviation of the factor abundance 
measures for each year. As shown in the table, in all three years, the relative rankings for 
most OECD economies have remained consistent which means there have been no 
significant changes in relative factor endowments within each of these economies in the 24.

We report rankings using adjusted income shares. The rankings using consumption shares were 
qualitatively similar and are available upon request. 16 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 time period examined. Most OECD economies consistently rank skilled labour and 
capital at the top of their relative resource endowments as measured by the factor services 
employed. The rankings for Mexico, Chile, Hungary, Poland and Turkey show a greater 
reliance on land and natural resources. Australia also shows a high reliance on natural 
resources, but unlike the other countries listed, capital and skilled labour are also 
significant factors. Within their own resource structure, capital ranks first in Austria, 
France, Germany, Italy and New Zealand for each of the three years examined. Denmark, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States all consistently rank 
skilled labour as number one, relative to their other resource use. These countries show a 
high use of labour in general, with unskilled labour ranking second. Despite the relative stability in rankings of endowments in OECD countries, there 
have been some noteworthy developments among member states. Into the 2000s, both 
skilled and unskilled labour moved up in ranking over capital for Australia. New Zealand 
experienced a small change in its endowment rankings with the role of natural resources 
declining and unskilled labour increasing. Korea shows an increase in the prominence of 
capital in place of unskilled labour while Japan's unskilled labour and capital both 
increase their rank relative to the use of their other resources, namely skilled labour. The 
increasingly significant ranking of unskilled labour in Japan (as foreshadowed by their 
large stock of unskilled endowment) is reflected in employment growth patterns. Between 
1990 and 2009, the only employment sectors which enjoyed consistent positive growth in 
Japan were labourers, service workers and professional and technical workers (Statistical 
Bureau Office of Japan 2010). The first two categories, which experienced the fastest 
growth, are dominated by unskilled workers. Spain, Poland and Hungary all saw their top 
ranked resource move from land in 1997 to capital by 2004. Land and natural resources hold the dominant positions in the SEMs for each of the 
three time periods (Table A3). As with the OECD, the rankings show little movement 
over this time. Exceptions are Brazil and South Africa who both experienced a shift away 
from land and resource extraction to a greater reliance on capital and labour. In both these 
economies, capital was ranked the highest in 2004. All countries examined show 
relatively low rankings in the use of skilled labour. A notable difference between the two country groupings is in the standard deviation 
of the abundance measure. This measure provides some insights in the changing 
endowment structure and the relative intensities with which resources are used within 
each economy examined. The more dominant one or two resources are in terms of their 
relative intensity, the greater the spread in values among the resources and the greater the 
standard deviation. Thus, it is interesting to see if these values have changed over the 
three time periods examined. We see countries like France, the United Kingdom and Germany with small and fairly 
constant measures of standard deviation, implying the relative intensity of factor usage 
has changed little over the three time periods. Greece and Russia exhibit large standard 
deviations implying dominance in a specific resource – in Russia's case natural resources. 
Greece's standard deviation declined significantly in 2004 as capital and labour began to 
play a greater role in its economic activities diversifying away from natural resources. 
Interestingly enough, the United States shows a slightly increasing standard deviation 
among its factor measures while its actual rankings remain stable. This is due to an 
increasing use of labour relative to that of capital. Mexico and Chile, on the other hand, 
experienced a decline in their standard deviation. For Mexico, there was a relatively small 
change in the use of labour and capital across its economic activities while for Chile the THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 17 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 use of labour increased relative to that of capital. What is interesting for Chile is that 
while the relative rankings of the two labour and capital measures do not change, the 
relative abundance measure shows a convergence in the intensity of usage. 
Among most of the SEMs, there is much greater variation within each country's 
resource ranking as shown by the standard deviations. The exceptions are Brazil, which 
has the lowest standard deviation of all economies reported here, and South Africa whose 
measure substantially declined in 2004. This implies that Brazil has employed the five 
resources measured here with relatively equal intensity in each of the three time periods. 
Thailand's standard deviation has increased as evidenced by the large and increasing 
factor abundance measure for land. This would imply that agricultural products are taking 
a larger role while capital usage shows a relative decline. India remains dominated by its 
land usage as does Indonesia. However, Indonesia's factor abundance measures for land 
and natural resources have declined somewhat indicating a potential increase in the 
diversity of other resources used. What the above discussion highlights is a relatively stable factor abundance story for 
most of the advanced OECD countries. 28 However, the dynamics of changing market 
structure are evident, as illustrated by the changing ranks and growing dispersion of 
relative factor abundance measures in, for example, the United States and South Korea. 
Chile, Mexico and Poland show decreasing variation among measures of factor 
abundance which could imply, as revealed by factor abundance measures, established 
production patterns. Turkey, on the other hand, shows increasing dispersion potentially 
indicating a changing relative factor base. SEMs, for the three time periods examined, show a relatively consistent factor 
ranking, still heavily dependent on land (i.e. agricultural) and natural resources. However, 
movement to capital goods can be observed in the case of Brazil and to a lesser extent, 
Indonesia. Most countries continue to show a factor endowment story related to 
agriculture and natural resources. Overall, these results are consistent with those observed in factor endowment trends. 
The stability in both groups of countries' rankings is a possible reflection of the large 
established factor stocks in these economies. That is, the large share of capital and skilled 
labour stocks in the OECD and the unskilled labour stocks in the SEMs. However, the 
small shifts in rankings and the changing abundance measures, along with their standard 
deviations, show an emerging trend of diversification into using capital and skilled labour 
for SEMs and a subtle shift in the OECD endowment usage as well. How has factor content of trade changed over time? We calculate a measure of factor content for each of the five GTAP factors for the 
three time periods (1997, 2001 and 2004) based on a derivation of the basic equation 
shown in (1) and presented in Figures A 9 and 10. 29 Positive values are an indication of a 28. 
While we are able to look at a greater level of factor disaggregation than previous studies, our 
measures are still quite broad. It is to be expected that if we could conduct this analysis at an even 
more refined level of inputs (e.g. different types of skilled labour) we may see different patterns 
emerging. 29. 
The values at the economy-wide level were scaled by relative income measures to ease comparisons. 
The authors wish to thank Frank Van Tongeren for providing a crucial piece of code to perform the 
calculations. 18 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 comparative advantage as implied by exporting abundant factors of production, while a 
negative value reflects a negative factor content of trade. For ease of discussion, we present a measure of factor content of trade for three 
factors: skilled labour, unskilled labour and capital, for OECD economies (Figure A9) 
and SEMs (Figure A10). As expected, most of the OECD countries show a deficit in 
unskilled labour (panel 1). The notable exceptions are Japan and Korea who have 
surpluses in each of the three years, as do, albeit to a lesser extent, Australia, Chile, 
Finland, Ireland, Slovenia, Switzerland, Estonia, Turkey and the United States. This 
outcome is consistent with the rankings of relative factor abundance presented in the 
previous discussion. For example, the United States and Japan had the highest OECD 
stocks of unskilled labour and both show labour in general (skilled and unskilled) as a 
consistently ranked highly utilised resource relative to the other resources used. A notable 
exception is Korea. Its unskilled labour stocks were not significantly higher than other 
OECD countries, showing a trade deficit in this factor (France, for example) yet its 
relative factor usage ranking for unskilled labour was behind both land and capital in 
2001 and 2004 (Table A2). However, broadly speaking these results do reflect the 
patterns observed in the factor endowment trends noted in section III. The highly positive values for both Japan and the United States in its factor content of 
skilled workers shown in the following panel is again a reflection of the abundance of 
labour reported for these countries. France, Italy and Germany, among others, are all 
shown to have deficits in their factor content of trade in skilled workers. This is in fact 
surprising as most OECD countries have a relative abundance of skilled workers vis-a-vis 
the rest of the world and skilled labour ranks as Italy and Germany's second most 
intensively used resource (Table A2). However, where these countries show a consistent 
comparative advantage is in the area of capital, where all three have relatively large 
positive values (France excepting in 2004). Mexico's increase in capital stock and its 
associated increase in relative usage rank are reflected in its positive factor content of 
trade for capital. This trend is observed despite Mexico's falling k/l ratio which is more a 
reflection of faster labour growth than declines in capital stock. While the measure 
experienced a downturn in 2004, it was strongly positive in 1997 and 2001. Other 
countries with factor content surpluses in capital include New Zealand, Ireland and Chile 
and the newly emerging OECD economies of Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and 
Turkey. The United States and the United Kingdom are shown to have a negative factor 
content of trade in capital in each time period examined. This could be due to the 
―de-industrialisation‖ of these economies as identified in Interim Report 1. The increasing 
use of resources in the production of services is something that was observed throughout 
the OECD but especially so in countries such as the United Kingdom and United States. 
As further noted in Interim Report 1, the share of manufactured exports from the top 
OECD exporters has been declining over the period 1990-2007. Finally, the United States 
and United Kingdom were among the lowest ranked OECD economies in measures of 
GFCF to value added in manufacturing (Figure A6). The three panels in Figure A10 look at the same measures for the SEMs. As expected, 
almost all show a comparative advantage in unskilled labour judging by the factor content 
of their trade. Some countries, Thailand, Russia and South Africa, show a negative factor 
content of trade in more recent years, but for South Africa and Russia, this is not a 
consistent pattern and for Thailand, it is decidedly smaller in recent years. Neither South 
Africa nor Thailand (information was not available for Russia) have large stocks of THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 19 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 unskilled labour with respect to other SEMs (Figure A4). Again, as expected, all show a 
negative balance in skilled labour with the exception of Brazil and Malaysia who both 
show a positive factor content of trade in this resource in more recent years (2001 and 
2004). Interestingly, relative stocks of skilled labour with respect to other SEMs were no 
higher in these two economies (Figure A3) and skilled labour actually ranked fifth in 
Malaysia's relative factor usage (Table A3). Another interesting observation can be seen in the patterns revealed when looking at 
capital. All of the SEMs show at least one period with positive factor content for capital. 
This implies that the trade balance in goods using capital is positive and thus these 
countries have a comparative advantage in this resource. A possible explanation for this 
pattern is the growing industrial production base of these economies, especially those in 
Southeast Asia. As observed in Interim Report 1, OECD countries are moving toward 
services and away from traditional ―capital intensive‖ manufacturing and the slack is 
being picked up by SEMs. As these countries increase their inflow of FDI and expand 
their own higher value-added manufacturing processes, the capital content of their trade 
should necessarily increase. We saw this by the increased rank of capital usage in some of 
these economies, China especially, implying growing participation of relatively capital 
intensive goods in their trade. These outcomes are consistent with the growth in capital stocks in SEMs and a slower 
investment rate among OECD countries observed above (Figure A1). Further, we see that 
the majority of OECD countries which have an increase ranking in capital factor usage 
are emerging OECD economies like Poland, Mexico and Estonia while only a few SEMs 
show an increased ranking of capital (China, Thailand and South Africa). However, the 
increase in relative ranking for China is small, indicating that their factor usage is still 
dominated by other factors, i.e. labour. When we observe, however, the relative contribution of labour and capital as 
measured in countries' k/l ratios, we see that capital still dominates among OECD 
countries. What this implies is that while the production base is shifting, it is shifting 
slowly. OECD countries still employ a relatively large share of capital reflective of their 
large capital stocks while SEMs employ larger shares of labour, reflective of their stocks. 
However, among those sectors seeing the most growth in each region (i.e. services in 
OECD and manufacturing in SEMs) we see the potential reversal of these resource uses. 
Overall, the base is dominated by capital in the OECD with changes in labour, while the 
base is dominated by labour in SEMs and capital is driving the change. This may also 
imply something about the nature of traded versus non-traded goods. Overall, according 
to resource rankings, the relative use of labour by OECD countries has remained fairly 
stable while capital has increased. However, the factor content of resources implies these 
rankings will change to reflect a declining use of capital among traded goods, and a 
possible reflection of the shift from manufacturing to services. What role has intermediate inputs played in measuring factor content of trade? As stated above, traditional measures of factor content have tended to be based on 
primary factor services embodied in the trade of final goods and services. We aim to 
expand this measure to include the factor services embodied in intermediate inputs – 
imported as well as locally sourced -as well. Thus, equation (1) becomes: i

i's intermediate inputs matrix B is adjusted to fully account for imported intermediates, as 
outlined in the technical appendix, and T is the net trade vector in country i. We can further examine the trends in factor content derived from the traditional 
HOV specification by comparing the outcomes of an equation which accounts for a 
country's use of resources embodied in its intermediate inputs with one that does not. 
This analysis is discussed below. While we developed results at the general country level, 
we report here those outcomes pertaining to individual sector outcomes. 30 Including a correctly specified measure of traded intermediates is crucial to a more 
accurate measurement of factor content. In order to better understand the relative 
importance of intermediate trade we examine the factor content of trade with and without 
imported intermediate inputs for China and the United States. 31 China We examine the trends in factor content across sectors for three factors of production: 
skilled labour, unskilled labour and capital. Given that most imported intermediate shares 
are in the manufacturing sector, we begin our analysis in this area. In addition, because 
we are comparing with the United States and the changing nature of the two economies 
stresses the role of services, we include this sector as well. Figure A11 shows the factor content of Chinese trade for skilled labour in three time 
periods: 1997, 2001 and 2004. The bars represent the factor content of trade as defined by 
equation without explicitly accounting for intermediate inputs and the dots are defined 
with intermediate inputs. While measures without show a consistently negative balance 
across both sectors and time periods, there are significant difference when accounting for 
intermediates. When examining skilled labour, accounting for intermediate inputs in the calculation 
of factor content reduces the observed deficit, or creates a small surplus, in almost every 
sector. Notable exceptions are the chemical and rubber sector (crp) and the trade (retail 
and wholesale, trd) sector in 2001. Thus, for example, it would appear that the inputs 
which China accesses from the rest of the world are more skill intensive in the production 
of electronics and other manufacturing goods. Across the sectors of textiles (tex), wearing 
apparel (wap) and leather (lea), the same phenomenon is observed, although to a lesser 
extent. An outlier is the other services sector consisting of public administration and 
government services (osg). Here, especially in 1997 and 2001, we see a large surplus 
reduced to a small deficit in 1997, balanced trade in 2001 when accounting for the factor 
content of intermediate inputs. This would imply that China was importing intermediate 
inputs that are non-highly skill intensive, or at least less skill intensive than non-traded 
intermediate inputs. By 2004, this trend had reversed itself and including intermediate 
imports leads to a slightly larger surplus, implying that more skilled labour was now 
being sourced internationally. Turning to unskilled labour, shown in Figure A12, the pattern of comparative 
advantage appears to be changing regardless of intermediate inputs (although these inputs 30. 
Table 2 in the Data Annex provides a list of sectors covered. 31. 
While similar comparisons are available for all covered countries, as two of the largest trading 
nations, we focus our discussion on these two countries. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 21 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 impact the results as well). In 1997 and 2001, we observe surpluses in sectors using 
unskilled labour (before adjusting for intermediate inputs). These include construction 
(cns), chemicals and rubber, non-metallic minerals (nmm, such as cement, lime and 
concrete), trade and other business services (obs). By 2004 none of the sectors show a 
surplus in unskilled labour. This is consistent with the decline in the relative abundance 
ranking for unskilled labour in China between these two time periods. However, once we 
account for the factors embodied in intermediate inputs, we observe a number of strong 
surplus sectors. These include electronics (ele), other manufacturing (omf), textiles, 
wearing apparel, leather and lumber (lum). Again, this could be an indication of China's 
own increasing use of production outsourcing, especially in the textiles and electronics 
sectors. Capital shows a different story to that of labour (Figure A13). In most of the sectors, 
in all three time periods, China has a small surplus in capital, and we see this trend 
strengthening in 2004. However, as distinct from labour, including intermediates creates a 
smaller surplus and even a deficit in many sectors including paper products (ppp), 
petroleum and coke (p_c), chemical and rubber, iron and steel (i_s), motor vehicles 
(mvh), other machinery and equipment (ome) and trade. By 2004 many services sectors 
see shrinking surpluses when intermediate inputs are accounted for, including finance and 
banking (ofi) and other business services. As stated above, this implies that most 
imported intermediate inputs are more capital intensive than other inputs while imported 
intermediate inputs into chemicals and machinery and equipment, for example, are less 
capital intensive in 2004. While we do not have detailed source information for 
intermediate inputs to China, looking at total imports provides some explanation. Japan 
remains a major source of imports across four of the five sectors in 2004. Taiwan and 
Korea also contribute significantly to imports of chemicals and rubber and other 
machinery and equipment while Hong Kong is by far the largest supplier of imports in the 
trade sector, all sectors with implied higher capital input in imported than domestic 
intermediates. However, among those sectors which showed lower capital intensity in 
imports – electronics and other manufacturing – Malaysia, India and Thailand were also 
significant sources of imports. The United States Figure A14 shows the same three sets of graphs for the United States, that is, the 
evolution of surplus/deficit sectors with and without intermediate inputs for skilled 
labour. Across all three time periods the United States shows a significant surplus in 
skilled labour in the services sector with other business services showing particular 
strength in 2004. Other sectors, such as motor vehicles, other machinery and equipment, 
chemicals and rubber, construction and trade had shown relatively strong surpluses with 
smaller values in 2004. Intermediate inputs make less of a difference in the overall results of the 
United States data over each successive period. Indeed, by 2004 the only sectors outside 
services that experience a relatively large shift is other machinery and equipment and, to a 
lesser extent, chemicals and rubber. These small changes are in contrast to China who 
shows large changes in each time period. While this does not indicate that the United 
States has fewer imported intermediate inputs than China (indeed the many cases the 
United States imports more), rather that the resource profile in the inputs are more similar 
to those sourced from within the United States. 22 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Much the same pattern holds for unskilled labour in that there are small differences 
with and without intermediate inputs in sectors outside services (Figure A15). Here, 
however, many of the sectors go from large surpluses to balanced trade, implying that the 
United States imports unskilled-intensive intermediates. Sectors that maintain their 
surplus, albeit at a lower level include other transport equipment (otn), banking and 
business and government services sectors. Again, this implies that the United States trade 
in goods using unskilled labour is generally in balance with the exception of a few 
sectors, and trade in intermediate inputs have only a limited role to play in this story. As noted above, the role of capital in US trade is not as large as one would have 
expected a priori (Figure A16). Indeed, across the manufacturing sectors there are no 
significant surplus sectors in any of the three time periods examined with most of these 
sectors remaining more or less in balance. However, there are significant deficits across 
many of the services sectors. In 2004, the deficit in other business services sector was 
particularly large. Indeed, all of the service sectors (with the exception of the transport 
sectors) show deficits in each period. Thus, it would appear that these sectors are driving 
the deficit in capital observed for the United States in Figure A9. When adjusting for intermediate inputs, the deficits in the services sector change 
considerably. Most of the deficit sectors move to a balanced trade or even surplus as in 
the case of other business and government services. One of the issues with the 
measurement of capital is that we are unable to determine what part of the imported 
intermediate goods are made with the exporting country's capital from that which may be 
produced with US capital employed overseas. Thus, while it appears that the United 
Kingdom is a net importer of capital in these sectors, it may be that a large part of the 
capital is owned by US companies. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2009) show that trade 
between US companies and their foreign subsidiaries accounted for 47% of US imports in 
2005. Further they show that US imports in ―Business, Professional and Technical 
Services‖ (which overlaps with our other business services) grew in real terms by more 
than 66% between 1997 and 2004. From this analysis we can see what has been a growing acknowledgement in trade 
circles: intermediate trade matters. Further, we see that it affects factors differently. Thus 
if policy is to be effective, it must rely on analysis which includes intermediate trade and 
the embodied factor services in this trade, and includes it in a meaningful way, 
i.e. measured in terms of value added. How this information can be used in the formation 
of trade policy will be discussed in more detail in the fourth paper of this series. 
However, before we move to that, we provide some insights into how this information 
plays a role in analysing a widespread phenomenon across both OECD and SEM 
economies: that of wage inequality. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 23 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 V. Relationship between trade and relative wages The developments in factor content of trade are intertwined with factor returns 
because the latter function as signals about resource allocation and the former about 
utilization within a country. Trade literature analyzing factor content links the HOV 
model to the factor price equalisation (FPE) theorem because equalisation of marginal 
factor returns would be the expected outcome when two countries with identical 
technologies but with different factor endowments, producing the same goods or services 
engage in free trade. 32 The trade literature succinctly summarized in Freeman (1995) has 
investigated whether factor price equalisation occurs empirically across countries. The 
main conclusions are that factor price equalisation is a rare occurrence because of its 
demanding conditions. These conditions include: identical technology and tastes; similar 
ranking of sectors by skilled to unskilled and capital to labour ratios at all prices; absence 
of scale effects; and incomplete specialisation by all countries, that is, all countries 
produce the full set of traded goods. As a consequence of the breakdown in FPE, we need 
to identify other forces that could explain factor return differentials. This is important 
because these differentials are at the heart of the North-South development gap; they are 
also critical in explaining differing equilibrium growth paths across nations, and can 
exacerbate trade frictions (Trefler, 1993). Moreover, the growing importance of trade of 
intermediate goods observed above can have a potentially large impact on factor returns, 
in particular, wages, through production fragmentation and offshoring. Using data available in Freeman and Oostendorp (2000), we examine the evolution of 
real wages and wage inequality for a sample of OECD and non-OECD economies. 
Freeman and Oostendorp standardized the International Labor Organization's (ILO) 
―October Inquiry‖ survey to allow for wage comparisons across countries, industries, and 
occupations. 33 The resulting dataset covers approximately 130 countries and around 
161 occupations for the years 1983-2003. Details can be found in the Data Annex. The data in the sample allows compensation to be disaggregated by industries and 
occupations to identify those having the lowest and highest wages. Figures A17 and 18 
present the frequencies of industries and occupations which reported the lowest 
compensation in the sample. The occupation Room attendant or Chambermaid in the 
Restaurant and hotels industry received the lowest wage about 13% of the time across all 
countries. Other occupations receiving low compensation were Labourer, Field crop farm 
worker, Cash desk cashier, Sewing machine operator, and Waiter. The corresponding 
industries for these occupations were Textile (spinning, weaving and finishing), Retail 
trade (grocery), and Agricultural production. The occupations receiving the highest 
compensation across all countries were Air transport pilot, General physician, Air traffic 
controller, and Chemical engineer. The corresponding industries were Air transport and 
its supporting services; Medical and dental services; and Crude petroleum and natural gas 
production. Figures A19 and 20 present these occupations and industries. We next identify the industry/occupation breakdown for OECD and SEM economies. 
Figures A21 and 22 present the lowest paying industries and occupations for OECD 32. 
The Factor Price Equalisation Theorem states trade in goods has the ability to equalize factor prices 
where trade in goods is a proxy for trade in factors of production. 33. 
This circumvents measurement problems such as different reporting units, quality of reporting 
sources, wage levels, and other issues, providing the use of a unique standardised dataset. 24 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 countries. The occupation Room attendant or Chambermaid was the lowest compensated 
occupation and the industry was Restaurant and hotels. Other industries receiving the 
lowest compensation were Retail trade (grocery); Agricultural production (fieldworkers); 
and Manufacturing of wearing apparel. Note that in our analysis of factor content, we 
observe some of the most significant shifts in trade positions from including intermediate 
inputs were in the Textile (including wearing apparel) industry. Figures A23 and 24 
present the reverse, the highest compensated industries and occupations, in the OECD 
countries. Air transport pilot, General physician, Air traffic controller, and Chemical 
engineer were again the highest compensated occupations. The industries were Air 
transport and supporting services, Medical and dental services, and Manufacturing of 
industrial chemicals. Figure A25 shows that Labourer, Field crop farm worker, Plantation worker, and 
Room attendant or Chambermaids were the lowest compensated occupations in the 
SEMs. The lowest compensated industries were Textiles, Education services, Printing, 
Publishing and related industries, and Restaurants and hotels (Figure A26). Finally, the 
occupations which registered the highest compensation were Air transport pilot, General 
physician, Accountant, and Air traffic controller. Those industries paying the highest 
wages included Air transport, Medical and dental services, Construction, and Banking 
(Figures A 27 and 28). Notably, none of these sectors (with the exception of Textiles) 
figures prominently in SEMs factor content of trade. This anecdotal evidence provides 
little incentive to suspect a strong relationship between trade and wages. To more rigorously examine the influence of domestic and international wage setting 
mechanisms, we use the concept of factor price equalisation (Freeman 1995). As stated, 
the conditions for factor price equalisation are demanding and, therefore, observing wage 
convergence is rare. Moreover, factor price equalisation implies domestic labour market 
policies have little or no effect on the level of wages. Countries with larger labour forces 
would have an advantage in setting wage levels and could exert undue influence in 
determining modifications on wage levels. The exceptions to this potential influence are 
occupations found exclusively in the non-tradable sector which would not be affected by 
changes in the international environment. Figures A29-31 present the logarithmic difference between the wages reported for 
selected occupations identified as the lowest and highest paying in each country using the 
United States as reference. In this context, zero implies equality of wages and negative 
numbers represent wages lower than the United States, and vice versa for positive 
numbers. No consistent evidence of factor price equalization is shown in the figures. 34 
We do observe, however, the emergence of three wage levels, which seem to be 
associated with the particular country's development level. For example, in the case of 
Field crop farm worker the differences in wages between India and Bangladesh with the 
United States are the largest and maintain a consistent spread. Similarly, for Field worker 
the differences between Mexico and the United States; are smaller compared to India, 
Bangladesh, and China, but still maintain a consistent spread. Finally, the differences in 
wages between Austria, Italy, and Sweden and the United States with respect to Field 
workers are positive –wages are higher in these countries than in the United States—and 
consistent in this pattern. The same pattern can be found for Room attendant or 
Chambermaids. Another example, the case of General physician, shows a repetition of the 
aforementioned pattern. Countries such as Austria, Italy, and Korea have smaller 34. 
We examined the evolution of both nominal and real wages. The results are similar. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 25 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 differences with the United States and consistently higher wage levels compared to 
China, Hungary, and Mexico. Finally, regression results looking for convergence effects show no conclusive 
statistical evidence of convergence in real wages. 35 We analyse different sets of cross-
sectional regressions starting with a simple specification where the dependent variable is 
the percentage change in the real wage as a function of the initial level of development, 
proxied by the logarithm of gross domestic product per capita, and a constant. A negative 
and statistically significant coefficient on the logarithm of gross domestic product per 
capita would suggest a process of wage convergence. More developed countries initially 
would have their wages grow at a slower rate than less developed countries, thus allowing 
for catch-up. Table A4 in the Annex presents mixed evidence since the parameter 
estimates change sign (regressions 1 and 4) and statistical significance (regressions 2 and 
5) depending on the estimation method, the time period, and the inclusion of fixed effects. 
Next we include a measure of the country's initial level of openness, proxied by the 
sum of total imports and total exports as a share of gross domestic product, into the 
regression specification. The objective is to determine if the country's initial exposure to 
the international economy has any influence on the percentage change in real wages. A 
positive sign associated with the parameter estimate would indicate greater exposure to 
the international economy would be correlated with a greater percentage change in real 
wages. Table A5 in the Annex presents the regression results. The inclusion of the 
openness measure does not modify the previous conclusion where there is no clear 
evidence suggesting convergence in real wages between developed and developing 
economies. In addition, the openness measure itself does not prove to be robust and 
statistically significant as it is only positive and statistically significant in regressions 7 
and 9. Finally, we construct a concordance between the GTAP sectors and the ILO 
occupations and associate the industries in the ILO October Inquiry to the GTAP 
industries. We explore industry heterogeneity in case those industries which are more 
exposed to international trade show evidence of greater wage volatility. Given we were 
only able to map 27 GTAP sectors, we re-ran the regression models including these 
sectors as fixed effects. Table A6 in the Annex presents the parameter estimates. The 
parameter estimate of the logarithm of real per capita GDP shows mixed results by 
changing direction (regressions 1 and 2 compared to 3, 4, 5, and 6) from positive to 
negative and the parameter estimate associated with openness is not consistently 
statistically significant. All this evidence taken together suggests internal factors have 
greater influence on the setting and evolution of real wages. Thus far we have found no significant link between trade and wage determination. 
However, we have shown that, overall, factor abundance is reflected in a country's trade 
pattern. Therefore the next logical question is then to what extent does factor abundance 
influence factor returns. That is, do the returns paid to abundant factors used intensively 
rise as countries expand trade and fall in those factors that are relatively scarce? In 
particular, this would imply rising wages for low skilled workers in developing countries 
and decreasing wages for this type of individuals in developed economies. To examine this question, we construct yearly wage distributions to obtain more 
detail about the evolution of wages in the OECD and SEM economies. Figures A32 35. 
Regression results are reported in Tables 4, 5, and 6 of the Annex. 26 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 through 39 present these wage distributions for 1984, 1991, 1997, and 2001. 36 Figure A32 
presents the estimated wage distribution for OECD countries in 1984 comparing it to a 
normal distribution created using the data's observed mean and standard deviation. The 
distribution is right-skewed with the majority of the mass concentrating at lower wage 
levels. Similarly, Figure A33 presents the wage distribution for SEM economies for 1984. 
While the distribution is skewed to the right, it presents different features such as two 
humps suggesting two major wage levels where most observations concentrate. Like the 
figure for OECD countries these suggest low paying jobs are more abundant and a 
smaller group of individuals command high wages. The remaining figures, Figure A34 
through Figure A39, are also right-skewed confirming that high paying jobs are relatively 
scarce. Figures A32 through 39 do not consistently suggest the presence of a sorting effect 
related to a skill premium. The skill premium relates to workers possessing a wider set of 
abilities becoming more valuable to firms. Likewise, more productive firms, paying 
higher wages, become more selective in their hiring policies (Helpman, Itskhoki, and 
Redding, 2009). Therefore, if a larger number of skilled individuals command higher 
wages and firms' hiring policies focus on skills we expect the wage distribution to 
develop multiple humps. The wages of low skilled workers would be located at the lower 
end of the distribution and wages for high skilled individuals would be located around the 
second hump towards the right end of the distribution. We only observe wage 
distributions with two humps for OECD countries in 1997 and for SEM economies in 
1984 and 1997. Have the changes in wage distribution observed above been a significant development 
across the OECD and SEMs? Documenting the per cent wage differential across 
occupations over time in each country allows us to look at within country wage 
distribution. Such distributions can be considered an outcome of particular labour 
policies, and can influence the factor content of trade. As these labour market policies, 
such as education and skill enhancement programs, influence a country's endowment 
structure, it is important to understand the link between policies which influence 
endowments, thus trade, and the potential feedback mechanisms which could impact 
wages. Figure A40 presents the evolution of the per cent wage differentials across 
occupations for the countries of interest. 37 Romania presents the biggest percentage 
spread and the largest changes in the spread, implying growing wage inequality. Other 
countries which showed increases in wage inequality from 1990 to the year 2000 are 
Brazil, India, Mexico, Slovakia, Italy, Portugal, and the United States. On the other hand, 
Canada and China show a decrease in wage inequality in this same period. 38 Finally, the 
wage distribution behaves in a stable manner in Finland, Iceland, Belgium, Norway, 
Denmark, The Netherlands, and New Zealand. Norway has the lowest percentage wage 
differential with this being just over one-half. The increase in the observed wage 36. 
The starting point is 1984 since there is no available data for SEMs in 1983. 37. 
There are several countries which are not included because of lack of data. In particular Chile, 
France, Luxembourg, Switzerland for the OECD group; Indonesia for the Enhanced Engagement 
group, Egypt, and Malaysia for the other Selected Emerging Market economies. 38. 
Given the available data for China only goes to the year 2000 we cannot follow-up on developments 
regarding wage inequality in the subsequent years. However, Wu and Perloff, (2005) report figures 
that suggest an increase in rural-urban inequality in later years. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 27 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 differential in most economies over this period correlates with world economic expansion 
and increased trade in the decade of the 1990s. This of course does not imply a causal 
link. Figure A41 shows a detailed picture of the percent wage evolution among OECD 
countries where data is available. Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Turkey experienced an 
increase in wage inequality, but not the Czech Republic. While Mexico and the United 
States both saw wage inequality increase, the increase in Mexico was greater. Other 
OECD countries that have suffered from an increase in wage inequality are Italy, 
Portugal, and Sweden. On the other hand, Germany, Japan, Austria, Canada, and Korea 
have managed to make their wage distributions more compact. Thus, on the face of 
things, increases in wage inequality are not necessarily associated with large trading 
nations (i.e. difference outcomes for the United States and Germany) nor with those 
having a particular endowment structure (i.e. similar findings for Japan and Canada, for 
example). Turning to the SEMs, Romania and Brazil have experienced significant increases in 
wage inequality, while wage inequality in India, Singapore, and China had been falling 
up to the year 2000 (Figure A42). Focusing on Enhanced Engagement and Accession 
economies, Brazil had the highest level of wage inequality followed by India, and Russia. 
Brazil's percent differential between the lowest and the highest wage was almost 
28 times. No clear linkage between factor content of labour (either in ranking or intensity) and 
wage inequality emerges from this analysis. Thus, while trade expansion has occurred 
during this period of overall wage inequality growth, circumstantial evidence does not 
indicate a strong link to trade. 39 Overall, while we do not explicitly test for FPE, we did not observe trends which 
would suggest factor price equalisation in workers' wages. The differential in wages is 
consistently maintained leading to the improbability of factor return convergence. Stated 
in other terms, wages in developed countries do not seem to be converging towards wage 
levels observed in developing countries with large labour endowments. This was not 
unexpected due to reasons described above, not the least of which is the differences in 
labour productivity noted in Section III. What these various trends do suggest is that 
differences in labour (reflected in different wage levels) lead to the application of 
different technology matrices (which we have shown to play a major role in correctly 
analysing the factor content of trade). We also do not observe reductions in wage 
inequality in unskilled labour abundant countries (SEMs) where this factor of production 
is shown to be used intensively. We observe evidence of a skill premium in the wage 
distributions for 1997 in both OECD and SEMs, but such phenomenon does not appear 
consistently in the figures. However, as Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2009) state, 
firms appear to have changed their hiring practices focusing on hiring workers with a 
wider set of skills. This opens the door to explore and examine the impact of economic 
policies on the domestic labour market of these countries and the effective development 
of a labour endowment. 39. 
It is possible to try and establish a more robust link between wage inequality and factor content 
through more sophisticated econometrics, but that is beyond the scope of this paper and left to future 
research 28 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 VI. Conclusions and areas of policy consideration We observe that overall, factor content is reflected in changing trade patterns while 
the link to relative wages appears to be limited. 
OECD economies as a whole continue to hold the lion's share of capital and skilled 
labour endowment stocks while SEMs hold more unskilled labour. Overall, measures of 
factor content of trade reflect these holdings. However, while OECD countries have been 
shown to be accumulating capital stocks at a rapid rate, over 4% per annum for the past 
15 years, SEMs have been doing so at an even faster rate, over 11% over the same time 
period. The same observation can be made for skilled labour; OECD stocks growing at 
over 3% while SEMs are growing at an annual rate of almost 5%. Capital/labour (k/l) ratios show that OECD economies remain relatively capital 
intensive, and this is confirmed in the relative rankings of the intensity of this resource 
use in traded goods. Capital consistently ranks high, as does skilled labour. For SEMs, we 
see smaller k/l ratios and these factors rank lower in their relative usage; unskilled labour 
ranks high, but natural resources and land figure prominently in the relative intensity of 
factor usage for SEMs as well. There are broad exceptions (such as Australia for natural 
resources and Brazil for capital) but overall these results hold. If, however, we look a little deeper at movements in the rankings and relate them to 
the observed difference in factor accumulation across the country sample, we see 
increasing use of unskilled labour in OECD countries and capital increasing its intensity 
among SEMs. These changing dynamics are reflected in the total factor content for trade for capital, 
skilled labour and unskilled labour. However, the analysis did yield some unexpected 
results. Among the OECD economies, the two largest capital stock holders – Japan and 
the United States – show deficits in the trade of capital embodied goods. More in line 
with expectations, newly emerging OECD economies such as Hungary, Chile and Poland, 
all show strong surpluses. We see an increase in the use of unskilled labour embodied in 
the United States and Japanese trade, but also in Korea and Australia. SEMs show a 
strong surplus in unskilled labour trade across the board. Finally, skilled labour stocks are 
strongest in the United States and Japan and both show a sizable surplus in the factor 
content of skill embodied trade while only Malaysia and Brazil among the SEMs show a 
surplus here. The picture emerging among the OECD economies is thus more varied and nuanced 
than that among the SEMs. Part of the explanation for the OECD results could be the 
manner in which we think and account for factors. That is, whether the traditional method 
of measuring actual units of capital and labour, located with the geographic boundaries of 
a country, is still appropriate. Rather, we should be looking at more refined measures of 
individual tasks and factors roles in intermediate inputs, which are not necessarily defined 
by geographic boundaries. The large literature on production fragmentation and 
offshoring attest to this trend. Trade, even factor content, can no longer be thought of as a 
function of the endowments located solely within a country's borders, but rather can be 
seen as a function of trade-in-goods and trade-in-tasks where the level and direction of 
this trade are a function of the changes in the costs of moving goods and particular tasks 
and ideas, rather than ―jobs.‖ Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2010) present a model which attempts to integrate these 
new patterns of firm behaviour into traditional trade theory like HOV. They argue that THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 29 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 this movement of tasks creates ‗shadow migration' and changes the way factors are 
characterised in standard trade theory. This, they argue, explains why standard trade 
theory presents so many ‗unexpected' results. This observation can be inferred from the analysis of trends in factor content with and 
without fully accounting for imported intermediate trade flows. We observe shifting 
patterns in comparative advantage depending on whether we account for worldwide use 
of resources, regardless of location. In the United States we see changes mainly across the 
services sector, while China experiences large differentials in the outcome of their 
manufacturing sector – both of these dynamic and growing sectors in the respective 
economies. Finally, when exploring the impact of these trends on wages, and wage differentials, 
we find little evidence of a strong link. This is especially true when we look at trends in 
wage inequality where it appears that domestic conditions have a greater bearing on 
outcomes than trade patterns in general, and factor endowments in particular. For policy 
makers, the complexity of the endowment/trade/wages link means careful analysis is 
required of any policies attempting to affect labour market outcomes through trade. As the driving forces behind trade patterns change, so must the approach to 
measuring these patterns. We have shown that intermediate goods play an important role 
in the analysis driving policy advice. In addition, inferred here is the importance of 
foreign direct investment and the role domestic capital, employed overseas, can make to 
notions of trade deficits or surpluses. Thus, policy advice based on simplistic measures of 
trade can be misleading. Given that resource stocks are still a major driver of trade patterns, policies that 
develop and enhance these stocks will help countries shape their future comparative 
advantage. We have shown that factor content is an important determinant of comparative 
advantage and that comparative advantage, in turn, drives trade patterns. What is 
important for policymakers is the fact that this directional flow -endowments to 
comparative advantage to trade – does not work in the reverse order. Targeting industries 
and ―picking winners‖ is inefficient in the long run, because it is inconsistent with this 
basic causal flow. Therefore, trying to impact endowment sectors – such as employment – 
through trade policy is counter-productive. That is not to say that a country cannot have 
an influence on its comparative advantage, rather this is best accomplished by developing 
factors more broadly. A major policy implication of this work is that the best approach to 
influencing trade outcomes is to invest in resource market enhancement, such as 
education and training for labour and transparency and availability for capital. 30 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?

The 
capital stocks were calculated with the perpetual inventory method using real gross fixed 
capital formation flows from the World Bank World Development Indicators. For the 
base stock in 1980, an average of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) flows was 
calculated from 1978 to 1982 to limit year specific anomalies and multiplied it by two. 
The depreciation rate used was 7%. The stocks were adjusted with the price of investment 
from the Penn World Tables to convert the PPP values into units of capital. Data for 
stocks were unavailable for Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey, Slovenia, Singapore, and 
Israel. Labour stocks were taken from the IIASA and Vienna Institute for Demography data 
sets. Labour stocks are defined as total population over the age of fifteen, providing 
information about the total human capital available, but not differentiating between 
economically active and those that are unable or choose not to work. These data report 
populations by age, sex and level of educational attainment for 120 countries for 1970-
2000 using demographic back projection methods. Skilled labour includes the population 
with completed tertiary education. This data set takes into account fertility, mortality, and 
migration rates for improving the accuracy of population projections by education level.

www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/POP/edu07/index.html?sb=12. Given actual observation for 2005 are unavailable, the data for 2005 was taken from 
the Education Forward Projections dataset for 2000-2050. The data was based on the 
Global Education Trend Scenario series which assumes that a country's educational 
expansion will converge on an expansion trajectory based on the historical global trend. 
Identification of the global trend is based on a data driven-judgmental analysis. To minimise inconsistencies and promote analysis based on real trends as opposed to 
difference in accounting methods, we focused on obtaining data from sources which 
covered as many countries as possible, over as long a time period as possible. We 
examined flows of capital and labour relative to their contribution to output. All measures 
for flows are in US dollars (USD). For annual expenditures on capital and labour, we 
used GFCF and Total Wage Bill to Value Added. The majority of the data for OECD 
countries was taken from the OECD Structural Analysis database (STAN) whenever 
available. Gaps in this data and information for non-OECD countries were supplemented 
from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics database and the World Bank Trade Production and 
Protection database. Remaining gaps in the data were supplemented from national 
sources. For Brazilian GFCF, we utilised information from the Annual Industrial Survey 
(Pesquisa Industrial annual) from the IBGE website (www.ibge.gov.br). Firm level data 
for manufacturing companies was used summing new capital formation with 
improvement to existing capital less depreciation. These capital figures were then 
converted to USD using OECD MEI exchange rate figures for this period. For South 
Africa, GFCF figures were taken from the South African Reserve Bank reporting GFCF 
by Economic Activity and these figures were also converted using MEI exchange rates. 34 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 GFCF, Value Added, and employment for China were gathered from the National Bureau 
of Statistics of China from the Statistical Yearbooks. The Employment data was collected 
from the employment breakdown by sector for manufacturing, the GFCF was taken from 
the GDP by expenditure series, and Value Added were supplied by the OECD's 
Economics Department from staff calculations based on other national sources. Indian 
employment data were taken from the IPUMS micro data set put together by the 
University of Michigan. This survey data provided employment information by sector for 
1983, 1987, 1993, 1999, and 2004. Despite these efforts, some gaps in the data persist. 
Data for GFCF was unavailable for Switzerland, Russia and Slovenia. For Total Wage 
Bill data is missing for Switzerland. For the labour productivity calculations of output per worker, we used World Bank 
World Development Indicators of total labour force and GDP in constant USD 2000. 
Ideally, a measure of GDP per hour worked would have been useful, but no complete 
cross country data on this was available at this time. Table 1. K/L Ratios (units of capital per worker) 1990

This publicly available, completely documented (Dimaranan and McDougall (2002) and 
Badri and Walmsley (2008)) database provides input-output tables for between 45 and 
85 countries (depending on the database version), 57 sectors and five factors of 
production. It consists of independently complied country-specific input-output tables 
(thus allowing us to recover country-specific technology matrices) which are reconciled 
to bilateral trade data and other statistics. The data have been through seven public 
releases and have been extensively tested by members of the GTAP consortium and other 
researchers. In order to observe the factor content in different time periods, we use three of the 
GTAP databases to derive the necessary components of this part of our analysis. These 
databases are version 5, corresponding to a base year of 1997; version 6 corresponding to 
a base year of 2001 and version 7, corresponding to a base year of 2004. To cover as 
many countries and sectors in a consistent manner, GTAP measurements are made in 
value terms (US$). This allows the consistent basis from which to compare outcomes 
across countries. While we do acknowledge the well known shortcomings of measuring 
economic variables in USD (as well as the shortcomings of other measures such a PPP), 
we believe the value in obtaining an internally consistent database outweighs any 
potential bias introduced in our figures. Table 2 presents the primary regions covered in our analysis and the corresponding 
year of the base input-output data for each database version. Table 3 presents the sectors 
included in the analysis. 36 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Table 2. Country and input/output table coverage GTAP7.1 GTAP6

THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 39 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Trends in relative wages The Occupational Wages around the World dataset by Richard Freeman and Remco 
Oostendorp was used to examine wages and occupations. Freeman and Oostendorp 
transformed the International Labour Organization's October Inquiry Survey into a 
consistent data file on pay for 161 occupations in over 150 countries from 1983 to 2003. 
The standardization allowed for comparison across countries circumventing measurement 
problems such as differences in reporting units, quality of reporting sources, wage levels, 
and any other country specific issues. The wages are reported in domestic currency units 
and in US dollars. The figures employed were in US dollars and deflated using the 
deflators in the Penn World Tables to account for purchasing power parity issues. The 
following tables present the countries, industries, and occupations used in the wage 
analysis. 40 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Table 4. Countries and Industries – wage Country Name

502 THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 43 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Technical Annex The theory The theory of trade and comparative advantage has a long tradition in the economics 
profession. Starting with Ricardo (whose theory predicts that a country will export 
products in which it has a comparative advantage, that is, where its labour productivity is 
high relative to its labour productivity in other products. The theory moved on to 
Heckscher (1919) and Ohlin (1933) who emphasized the role of labour, capital and land 
in explaining how their availability shapes a country's pattern of specialisation and hence 
their comparative advantage. Samuelson (1948) (and others) developed the two-factor, 
two-sector model that became the standard for trade theory leading to the version of the 
H-O model where a capital rich country – that is, one that has more capital per worker 
than its trade partners – should export capital-intensive products. Leontief (1953) calculated the labour-output and capital-output ratios for various 
sectors in the United States economy and then calculated how much of these factors were 
embodied in US exports and imports. He found that the capital-labour ratio of US imports 
exceeded the ratio embodied in exports by 60%. This finding became known as the 
―Leontief paradox‖. While the next several decades were devoted to solving this paradox, 
a test of the generalised H-O theory was elusive due to the fact that the theory predicts the 
relationship between endowments and trade within a certain technological structure. Thus 
to test the theory, one needs information on technology, endowments and trade. 
Vanek (1968) shows that under the HO model's assumptions, using a common 
technology matrix, the Leontief measure of factor content should equal the economy's 
measure of factor abundance. That is, the total factor content of a country's production 
(equal to that country's endowments) minus the factor content of its consumption should 
provide a measure of factor abundance where those factors that are relatively abundant 
are exported and those that are scarce are imported. This became known as the HOV 
model. Work that followed focused on identifying the gap between measured factor content 
of trade and the HO theoretically predicted value. Trefler (1995) was one of the first to 
show clearly the ways in which the data used to measure the theory deviates from the 
predictions of the model. Most of the subsequent work focused on the deviation of the 
common technology matrix and the inclusion of trade in intermediate inputs. This body of 
work (see, for example Davis and Weinstein (2001), Hakura (2001), Trefler and Zhu 
(2000, 2010) and Reimer (2006)) has shown the importance of incorporating these 
aspects when examining factor content of trade. 44 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 The model We start with the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model which is set in a multi-good, 
multi-factor world and focuses on the factor service content, such as labour, capital and 
land that are embodied in the exports and imports of countries. Vanek (1968) showed that 
a country's net factor content of trade equals its own factor endowments minus its share 
of the world factor endowments, share being based on the country's share of world 
expenditures. So for country i, F i = V i – s i V W , where F i is the factor content of its net 
trade, V i ,V W , its and the world's factor endowments respectively and s i its share of world 
expenditures. Measuring factor content of trade using expenditure shares, however, does 
not capture the true factor services utilised by a particular country (Deardorff, 1982). 
Thus, a better measure of factor content is using consumption shares. Thus, the HOV model of international trade can be stated as: w 
i 
i 
i 
i V 
s 
V 
AT 
F 
 
 
 , 
(A1) In this specification, A is the input requirements matrix, T is the vector of net trade for 
i, such that F is the vector of factor content in net exports. V i is the vector of factor 
endowments in country i, V w is the vector of world factor endowments and s i is country i's 
share of total world consumption. According to equation (A1) net exports for each factor 
is positive (negative) if, and only if, the country's endowments of the factor are greater 
(lower) than the content of its total domestic consumption of that factor. As stated above, studies have shown that the simple HOV model is strongly rejected 
by the data. However a model that allows for technological differences, a breakdown in 
factor price equalization, the existence of nontraded goods and the costs of trade is 
consistent with data (Davis and Weinstein 2001). Further work on the importance of 
intermediates in trade has shown the importance of incorporating these flows into the 
basic HOV framework (Reimer (2006) and Trefler and Zhu (2010)). We will take these 
issues in turn. Common technology matrix Attempts to accommodate differing technology matrices have been limited. Many 
studies (Davis and Weinstein (2001), Reimer (2006) and Bowen et al. (1997) for 
example) use both a simple adjustment to account for potential measurement error across 
economies. Aside from these simple adjustments, studies (Davis and Weinstein (2003) 
and Trefler and Zhu (2010) and Reimer 2006)) also adjust the technology matrices for 
productivity differentials, using the United States as a base. Under this hypothesis, the 
technologies of countries differ only by a Hicks-neutral shift parameter that can be 
characterised by a country-specific technology shift with respect to the United States. 
Finally, there are examples where researchers have incorporated specific country 
technology matrices in the analysis. For example, Hakura (2001) used OECD input 
output tables to allow for varying technology across four OECD members and found this 
improved the fit of the model significantly. However, this was applied to a subset of 
trading nations and applied a common technology to all inputs (domestic as well as 
imported). In the approach applied in this paper we make no adjustment for productivity 
differences among countries. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 45 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 First, studies examining the factor content generally look at a subset of countries and 
thus apply a common reference base (either technology matrix or productivity 
adjustment). For example, Reimer examines the factor content of trade in the context of 
two entities: the United States, and an agglomeration of technology matrices for the rest 
of the world (ROW). He then adjusts this ROW matrix for productivity differences with 
respect to the base country, the Unites States. In this study, we apply country-specific 
technology matrices for each of the economies examined and thus the differences in the 
technologies applied in each region are captured in their own technology matrices. On a more practical basis, the primary reason for the implementation of this 
adjustment in the literature is to improve the performance of their measured factor content 
when tested against the theoretically predicted value. It is not the purpose of this work to 
test the validity of the HOV model. Indeed, as briefly outlined above and in much more 
detail in the various works cited, this service has been performed. Rather we are using the 
model to measure factor content and fully expect these values to diverge precisely based 
on their productivity differentials. To do a prior adjustment for these differences is to 
reduce the information available in the measured values themselves. Factor price equalisation The failure of factor price equalisation (FPE) can lead to important differences in the 
technology matrices for traded and nontraded goods. The input coefficients differ in 
tradables because the failure of FPE has led countries to specialise in different goods. 
They differ in nontradables because the same goods are produced with different factor 
proportions. To the extent that FPE breaks down, the standard HOV needs to be adjusted 
to account for departures in the factor usage of nontrables goods from world averages. The need to make this adjustment is tied to the standardisation of technology matrices 
across countries. Again, we are not applying world averages when inputting our 
technology matrices so the adjustment is not as critical for our database. However, this 
issue does come into play when determining which data measurement (i.e. values versus 
units) arises. If the only reason that factor prices differ is due to factor-augmenting 
productivity differences, then we can use the reported values as representative of 
efficiency-adjusted factor usage as this measure is well suited for calculations of the input 
matrices. However, it is well acknowledged that FPE breaks down for reasons beyond 
quality differences. To the extent this breakdown is not captured, it is preferable to 
measure factor usage in terms of physical units and adjust for international quality 
differences in a different manner. Converting to physical units poses several problems for the analysis presented here. 
First, it dramatically reduces the number of factors available for examination to those 
with relevant, observable price information, i.e. total labour and capital. It also removes a 
source of information on factor-augmenting productivity differences which, as explained 
above, we purposefully make no adjustment for. Finally, as stated above, studies of factor 
content are designed to test the differential between fit of the theorectically-constrained 
model (for example, under assumptions of the realisation of factor price equalisation) and 
measured values. We, on the other hand, are interested in what measured values say about 
revealed patterns of trade between countries. The theory often factors away the exact 46 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 differences we hope to observe. Thus, we maintain measurement using values as opposed 
to units. 40 Intermediates While previous studies have incorporated intermediates into their analysis, they are 
generally treated as non-traded (for example Davis and Weinstein (2001) and Hakura 
(2001)). Reimer developed an approach allowing for internationally traded intermediate 
inputs in to the calculation of factor content. Theoretical proofs for such an approach 
were further provided in Trefler and Zhu (2010), that demonstrated the class of models 
that completely characterises, and are implied by, the Vanek prediction of the factor 
content of trade, including a traded intermediate sector. This section relies upon these 
theoretical developments to construct measures of factor content that accounts for both 
technological differences across country's production processes while explicitly including 
trade in intermediate goods that does not impose the importing country's technology, but 
rather allows for the producing a country's choice in techniques. Consider an economy with k factors and i goods so that the Leontief matrix is: D(I -B) -1 
(A2) Where each column of the k x i matrix D consists of primary factor inputs and each 
column of the i x i matrix (I -B) -1 captures the total intermediate inputs in the production 
of a good or service. 41 Proper measurement of B ensures that the matrix of direct and 
indirect factor requirements includes all the services of k endowments. In addition, by 
defining each D and B matrix through each country's unique input-output structure, we 
capture the technological differences in production needed to completely define the factor 
content approach. Referring back to the original HOV equation (1), we can restate it as follows: i

 (A4) Trefler and Zhu (2010) argue while several studies have applied equation (A4) to 
measure factor content, they have not done so consistently, nor fully accounting for 
international technological diversification. They show that the definition of factor content 
of trade needs to satisfy three criteria: 1) must be Vanek-relevant, that is consistent with 
the Vanek prediction that factor content is defined as in (A1); 2) the definition has a clear 40. 
As a means of comparison we adjusted for prices in the capital resource using data from two 
different sources: the Penn World Tables (as in Trefler and Zhu (2006)) and prices derived directly 
from the GTAP database (as in Reimer (2006)) and found no substantial qualitative differences in 
the results at the sector level. 41. 
See Trefler and Zhu (2010) for the technical proof. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 47 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 and useful economic interpretation; and 3) the definition does not require restrictions on 
the form of international choice of technology. However, arriving at such a definition of 
factor content when international technology matrices are allowed to vary has proven 
difficult. As stated above, Reimer (2006) does allow for internationally determined and traded 
intermediate inputs in his model. He uses a horizontal concatenation of country-specific 
direct factor input matrices to construct B in equation (A4) and thus provide an indication 
of how much of the world's factor k is embodied in i's production of a good. However, 
Reimer's model consists of two countries: the United States and the ROW and two factor 
inputs, labour and capital. Thus, it does not completely specify a variety of international 
technological choices. As we are attempting to measure the factor content (and thus input 
matrices) for 44 regions and five factors of production, applying such an approach 
becomes unwieldy, not to mention involving the loss of a tremendous amount of detail. Trefler and Zhu (2010) developed a more generalised approach relying on the 
proportionality assumption to recover a B matrix that is consistent with their three criteria. They derive an adjustment parameter,  to recover the share of domestic consumption, including intermediates, sourced locally. 42 Thus, we are able to estimate 
the world trade in intermediate inputs – that is, those sourced (and produced) locally and 
those sourced (and produced) overseas – by defining B as: i 
j i 
i 
j * 
B 
B   (A5) Where i j B is the input matrix of i sourced from j and  is defined as: i

and the denominator is i's total imports of g) and X is the exports of g from i. Thus i j  (g) is the share of domestic absorption that is sourced from country j. Summing over all j 
sources and subtracting from 1 provides the share of good g that is sourced locally. Referring explicitly to an intermediate input matrix of dimensions g, h (input of good g into industry h), we define i j B (g,h) as elements of i j B and i

Again, Trefler and Zhu (2010) report the details on the derivation of  . 48 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES? OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 As expressed in equation (A5), where equation (A5) suppresses the (g,h) reference to 
industries. When Trefler and Zhu (2010) applied this adjustment to data for 41 countries, 
focusing on labour inputs, their results show a 95% consistency rate with predicted 
values, as opposed to the 34% reported in previous studies. By measuring the amount of factors used worldwide to produce a country's trade 
flows, we can say that the factor requirements matrix for country i's trade is constructed 
accounting for the complete production process of each good that enters into net exports 
and adding up the factors actually used, including those used in producing intermediate 
inputs overseas (Deardorff 1982). This will further allow us to analyse the role of 
intermediate inputs in trade, by comparing the F derived in equations (A1) with its 
counterpart expressed generally in equation (A4), and adjusted by (A5). Ranking factor content In order to better understand the potential drivers of the factor content of trade, it is 
important to understand the relative factor endowment structure both within, and 
between, countries, and how that has changed over time. According to equation (A1), net 
exports of a factor is positive (negative) if the country's endowment of the factor is great 
(lower) than its content of total domestic consumption, that is if V i 
k – s i V w 
k >0, for factor k. 
Additionally, it is possible to look at a country's relative factor abundance (each 
endowment relative to other endowments within a country) by examining the variables 
normalised by the factor content of the country's consumption. Again, from 
equation (A1) we can define the following: s 
V 
c w 
k 
k * 
 (A9) where s remains the country's share of world consumption, V w 
k is the world endowment of 
factor k and c k is the content of factor k in domestic consumption (Muriel and Terra 
2009). The factor abundance test can be compared across the various factors k such that: ' ' k i 
k k i 
k c V 
c 
V  (A10) The relationship in (9) states that the content of factor k in net exports is higher 
(lower) than that of factor k' if factor k is relatively more abundant (less abundant); where 
factor contents are normalised by domestic consumption. We can also restate these 
values, measuring factor abundance by income rather than consumption, adjusting this 
value to take account of the trade balance as in Bowen and Sveikauskas (1992). To 
account for a country's income level (Y i ) adjusted by the trade balance (b i ) we can restate 
c k as follows: k 
i 
i i 
b 
k c 
b 
Y Y 
c 
* 
 
 (A11) and rank each factor accordingly. THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 49 OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011 Data In order to derive the various data points needed to obtain a HOV-consistent measure 
of factor content of trade, we need to have consistent measures of world output, 
consumption, trade, factors of productions and intermediate inputs. One source which 
provides such a database is the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). The details of this 
data can be found in the Data Annex. Wage regressions The specification for the cross-sectional wage regressions is: ik 
ik X 
y  
   (A12) where i indexes occupations and k countries; ik y is a vector of observations containing the growth rate of real wages by occupation by country in the sample; X is a matrix of observations with its first column containing a vector of ones, the 
logarithm of GDP per capita in 1984, and the logarithm of total trade as a share of 
GDP in 1984; ik  is the regression's error term; and  is a vector of parameters to be estimated. The parameter estimates are presented in Tables A4, A5, and A6 of the Annex Tables 
and Graphs.
