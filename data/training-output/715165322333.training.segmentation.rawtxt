This paper discusses how social disadvantage affects the learning experiences of households with 
fewer economic resources, at each stage of the individuals' life-course, and on some of the "social" effects 
of such learning. It argues that while education can be an escalator out of social disadvantage — leading to 
better job prospects for youths facing greater risks of poverty and reducing the prevalence of income 
poverty in adult age — educational failure can reinforce it: a significant minority of students in several 
OECD countries do not even complete compulsory education; students' test scores in lower secondary 
education are strongly shaped by family characteristics; and the expansion of university education has most 
often benefited households with better educated parents. Far from "equalising" opportunities, education can 
be a powerful driver of social selection. When returns to education increase over time, this may lead to 
greater inter-generational persistence of poverty and less equality of opportunities. 2. 
The paper discusses the role of policies that pay special attention to the learning experiences of 
individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, as part of a broader strategy to fight poverty and social 
exclusion. These policies fall into two main categories: 
@BULLET Educational policies. These policies can be designed with the aim of offsetting some key aspects 
of family disadvantage that hold back educational achievement, and these policies do not 
necessarily hold back students' achievement at the higher end of the proficiency scale. Some 
OECD countries have much more equitable policies regulating school admission than others, and 
sorting of students by proficiency levels occurs at a later age. Interventions that aim to bolster 
both cognitive and non-cognitive skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds can play an 
important role in limiting social exclusion and facilitating the task of social policies at a later 
stage of the individuals' life-course. 
@BULLET Social policies. These policies can be designed so as to strengthen their learning content. 
Emphasis is here placed on policies that offer cash transfers to families with children that are 
conditional on sending children to school; learning programmes targeted at youths who dropped 
out of formal schools; adult training targeted to individuals with lower educational attainment; 
policies that provide recognition for competences learned on-the-job; as well as programmes that 
aim to alter parental attitudes to education (e.g. parenting programmes) or that offer out-of-school 
programmes that can influence peer groups of children. 3. 
A crucial feature when designing programmes focused on the learning experiences of individuals 
is their timing. Over the years, a substantial body of evidence has accumulated that testifies to the 
importance of programmes targeted to pre-school children from disadvantaged background. This is less 
agreement on the effects of programmes targeting disadvantaged individuals in a later stage of their life-
course. The paper reviews evidence from three such programmes: school based programmes targeting 
disadvantaged students, financial support and 'mentoring' provided to disadvantaged students, and 
programmes for adults and high-school drop-outs. Evidence from programme evaluations suggests that 
such programmes can improve both employment and earnings prospects of individuals from poor families 
when they are properly designed, well-targeted, adequately financed, and monitored through appropriate 
evaluation strategies. 5 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 RÉSUME 4. 
Ce document présente une analyse de la relation entre désavantage social et parcours éducatifs 
des individus issus d'un milieu familial défavorisé à chaque étape de leur vie, et décrit certaines des 
conséquences de ces parcours pour la société dans son ensemble. Une conclusion générale est que si la 
formation peut servir d'ascenseur social –– en offrant de meilleures perspectives d'emploi aux jeunes les 
plus menacés de dénuement et en réduisant la prévalence de la pauvreté économique à l'âge adulte –– 
l'échec scolaire peut en revanche renforcer le désavantage social : dans plusieurs pays de l'OCDE, une 
minorité importante d'élèves n'arrive même pas au terme de l'enseignement obligatoire ; dans le premier 
cycle du secondaire, les résultats des élèves aux tests dépendent beaucoup des caractéristiques de la 
famille ; et le développement des études universitaires a le plus souvent profité aux ménages dont les 
parents étaient relativement mieux instruits. Loin d' « égaliser » les chances, l'éducation peut être un 
puissant moteur de sélection sociale. Dans un contexte où le rendement de la formation augmente avec le 
temps, cette dynamique pourrait conduire à une persistance de la pauvreté de génération en génération plus 
accentuée ainsi qu'une diminution de l'égalité des chances. 5. 
Ce rapport analyse aussi le rôle des politiques qui sont plus particulièrement axées sur les 
parcours d'apprentissage des personnes issues des milieux défavorisés, dans le cadre d'une stratégie plus 
vaste de lutte contre la pauvreté et l'exclusion sociale. Ces mesures peuvent être groupées dans deux 
grandes catégories: @BULLET Les politiques d'éducation. Ces politiques peuvent être conçues dans le but de compenser 
certains aspects essentiels des désavantages dus au milieu familial, qui freinent la réussite 
scolaire, sans pour autant nécessairement entraver celle des meilleurs élèves. Dans certains pays 
de l'OCDE, les règles d'admission à l'école sont beaucoup plus équitables que dans d'autres et la 
répartition des élèves par niveau de compétence se fait à un âge ultérieur. Les mesures destinées à 
renforcer les compétences à la fois cognitives et non cognitives des élèves issus des milieux 
défavorisés peuvent jouer un rôle important en limitant l'exclusion sociale et en atténuant le 
recours à des mesures sociales à un stade ultérieur de la vie des intéressés. @BULLET Les politiques sociales. Ces politiques peuvent dans leur conception avoir un contenu formation 
plus important. Sont en l'occurrence privilégiés : les politiques qui prévoient l'octroi de 
ressources financières aux familles à la condition que ces dernières envoient leurs enfants à 
l'école ; les programmes de formation ciblés sur les jeunes sortis prématurément du circuit 
scolaire ordinaire ; la formation pour adultes ciblée sur les individus ayant un faible niveau 
d'instruction ; les politiques de validation des acquis professionnels ; ainsi que les programmes 
dont l'objet est de modifier l'attitude des parents à l'égard des études (programmes de formation 
à l'art d'être parents, par exemple) ou qui proposent des activités extra-scolaires, pouvant exercer 
une influence sur des groupes d'enfants du même âge. 6. 
Un aspect essentiel des programmes axés sur les parcours d'apprentissage est le stade de la vie 
auquel ils sont mis en oeuvre. Au fil des ans, on a accumulé une masse considérable de données qui 
témoignent de l'importance de cibler les programmes sur les enfants issus des milieux défavorisés dès la 
préscolarisation. Il y a moins d'accord pour ce qui est des effets des programmes ciblés sur des personnes 
défavorisées à un stade ultérieur de leur vie. Ce document passe en revue des données factuelles 
concernant trois types de programmes : les programmes mis en oeuvre dans les établissements scolaires en 
faveur des élèves défavorisés ; les aides financières et le mentorat assurés à ces élèves ; et les programmes 
pour les adultes et les personnes qui ont abandonné leurs études dans le deuxième cycle du secondaire. Les 
évaluations disponibles suggèrent que lorsque ces programmes sont correctement conçus, bien ciblés, 
adéquatement financés et suivis grâce à des stratégies appropriées d'évaluation, ils peuvent améliorer à la 
fois l'emploi et les perspectives de gains des personnes issues de familles démunies. 6 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE 
AND EDUCATION EXPERIENCES I. 
Introduction 7. 
Education is a key driver of economic and social success for individuals, employers and nations. 
Writers in many disciplines have noted that education can enhance social welfare, impact upon economic 
growth and be a key factor in the design and implementation of economic and social policy. In many 
quarters education is believed to offer a route where people can escape from disadvantaged family 
backgrounds and climb the social ladder. There are, in short, social benefits of learning beyond the 
economic ones that accrue to each individual (Box 1). 8. 
However, education experiences remain strongly associated with social disadvantage. In many 
countries there are large numbers of people with very low education levels whose family origins were 
impoverished and characterised by disadvantage. Whilst education can break such intergenerational cycles 
of disadvantage, it can also act to reinforce them: for example, if education policy is not designed with 
egalitarian notions in mind. This is one of the reasons why the ability of education to operate as a 
mechanism with the potential to offset social disadvantage is important. 9. 
Empirical evidence from studies conducted by social scientists makes it clear that there is 
significant scope for education to play a role in influencing the economic and social situations of people. In 
cross-country comparisons of education and economic growth, formal schooling plays an important role in 
enhancing economic growth (Barro, 1997, Barro and Lee, 1993, and Krueger and Lindahl, 2001). 
Education has been shown to significantly raise labour market earnings and employment probabilities 
(Card, 1999) and to significantly impact upon health (Currie, 1995), crime (Lochner and Moretti, 2004) 
and a range of other social capital outcomes (Hammond and Feinstein, 2004). 10. 
Most of this work concerns itself with the 'average' effects of education. For example, by how 
much more does a country's GDP grow if average years of schooling rise? Or by how much on average do 
earnings rise for another year of schooling? There is a lot of evidence in this vein in a very rich and highly 
developed empirical literature. There is more limited research looking at the experience of disadvantaged 
groups. I consider both sets of evidence in this paper. 7 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Box 1. OECD work on the "social outcomes of learning" A large body of empirical literature has looked at the economic returns that investments in education bring to 
individuals. Such returns are, however, only part of the bigger picture. In addition to economic returns (in the form of 
labour market advantage), learning experiences — both in and outside school setting — bring other types of benefits. 
Some of these benefits accrue to individuals, as in the case of better health conditions; others may affect the broader 
community in which individuals live, as in the case of better parenting practices, greater involvement in community life 
and lower crime. For the purpose of better identifying and measuring these effects, the OECD Centre of Educational 
Research and Innovation launched in 2004 a project on the "Social Outcomes of Learning". This paper contributes to 
this project as part of the broader OECD work on resource distribution". There are two main reasons why discussions about the "social outcomes of learning" are of direct interest to the 
social policy community in OECD countries: @BULLET First is the attention recently given to the notion of "active social policies". Such notion — which featured prominently at the April 2005 meeting of OECD social policy ministers — emphasises the importance of 
shifting from a remedial approach in social policy to one that privileges the goals of 'making work pay' and of 
facilitating people's integration into the labour market. This shift of emphasis calls for greater attention to 
those learning experiences that can either enhance or hamper the employment and career prospects of 
individuals at greater risk of social exclusion. The more social policy makers pitch their strategies to 
'integration into the labour market', the less they can afford to ignore how learning shapes the labour market 
outcomes of poor people. @BULLET The second reason for investigating the social outcomes of learning relates to the traditional goal of social justice embedded in most social programmes. While, traditionally, these programmes have focused on 
measures of income poverty and inequality at a given point in time, growing attention is being paid today to 
the inter-generational transmission of such inequalities. The existence of such transmission has implications 
for both social justice and for economic efficiency, to the extent that able and motivated youths from 
disadvantaged backgrounds may be denied the opportunities provided by a modern market economy. 11. 
Because the existing empirical literature is less focused upon the scope for education to offset 
social disadvantage, it is worthwhile organizing the discussion into a two-stage process. There are large 
bodies of evidence first on how disadvantage affects learning experiences and second on how learning 
experiences affect outcomes in adulthood. It is the combination of the two links (in a world where the 
economic or social premium to education is increasing over time) that may worsen the conditions of those 
from disadvantaged families. Because of this, I motivate my discussion of the evidence by appealing to this 
life-course, or sequential, approach which splits the impact of education into a two-stage process: first, the 
impact of disadvantage on education over the life-course; second, the impact of education on adult 
economic and social outcomes. Even if both of these are 'average' effects, this sequential approach still tells 
us about the role education can play as a transmission mechanism. 12. 
Because educational experiences and achievement are increasingly important in shaping people's 
life chances, especially their ability to get a good job offering a decent career, this has significant 
implications for social policies in many OECD countries. The increased focus of active social policies on 
'making work pay' and integrating people into the labour market, coupled with education mattering more, 
means that governments need to focus more on education and education policy, to make sure that a group 
of disadvantaged individuals are not left behind. How the evidence on education and social disadvantage 
links to this policy debate will also be considered in this paper. 13. 
Discussing the evidence on the impact of education, and linking it to an appropriate policy 
perspective, is a highly challenging and important task. This is the aim of this paper, which is structured as 
follows. Section II discusses the evidence on how educational experiences are related to social 
disadvantage and other family characteristics. Section III considers research findings on the impact of 
education on economic and social outcomes in adult life. Section IV places the discussion into its 8 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 appropriate policy perspective, together with a discussion of evidence from education evaluations, whilst 
Section V concludes. II. 
Education and social disadvantage over the life-course 14. 
Education is linked to various dimensions of social disadvantage throughout an individual's life 
span. This includes their time in pre-primary education, in the compulsory schooling system during their 
childhood years, as young adults in post-compulsory education and during the years of adulthood. In this 
Section I consider empirical evidence on the connections between education and social disadvantage for 
each of these life phases in turn. The aim of this section is to discuss and summarise the evidence on how 
different dimensions of social disadvantage shape learning experiences during the life-course. 15. 
Much of the work in this area draws upon longitudinal data sources that follow children as they 
grow up and collect various data on their educational skills and experiences in these years, but also 
information on their parents and area where they were raised. The usual approach is to present findings 
from statistical regressions that relate measures of education to the disadvantage indicator of interest whilst 
controlling for other relevant factors. This research approach then shows the average links between 
education and disadvantage. Somewhat less common, though highly appealing from a research 
methodology perspective, is to assign children or adults to particular learning programmes (either through 
randomized controls, or through quasi-experimental routes offered by policy changes): this approach 
allows to carry out comparisons of affected individuals as compared to those not affected to deduce the 
impact on economic and social outcomes. Early childhood education 16. 
Gaps in cognitive and non-cognitive skills arise before children go to school. A huge, and 
sometimes contentious, research literature looks at many of the links between early child development and 
social disadvantage. Recognition of the importance of this connection is confirmed by the existence of 
active policies like Head Start in the United States or Sure Start in the United Kingdom, which are 
designed to level the playing field at or near school entry age for children from less privileged 
backgrounds. 17. 
Much of the work by economists and social policy researchers relates early age test scores of 
children to family background and uncovers important correlations. Some of the work, like that on early 
childhood programmes like Head Start (see the discussion in Currie, 2001), is of an experimental nature in 
that some children participate in a programme whereas others do not. The analysis thus compares a 
'treatment' group (those in the programme) with a 'control' group (those not in the programme) to evaluate 
the impact of the programme. 18. 
It is clear from this literature that test score gaps emerge across children from different family 
backgrounds at early ages. For example, a recent review by Meyers et al. (2004) documents sizable 
disparities in pre-school enrolment between children from high and low education parental backgrounds. 
Evidence shows that early childhood education programs narrow test score gaps between ethnic minority 
children and whites in the United States (Currie, 2001); and that attendance at pre-school confers a 
cognitive advantage on children before they enter school (see Magnusson et al. 2004, for the United States 
and Sammons et al. 2002, for the United Kingdom). 19. 
The observation that a significant amount of inequality of cognitive and non-cognitive skills can 
be tracked to the early years, and that these early age skills are key drivers of subsequent economic and 
social success or failure, makes some conclude that this is the time and place where education interventions 
need to occur. See, among others, a strong statement of this nature from Heckman and Wax (2004) who 9 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 state: "Like it or not, the most important mental and behavioural patterns, once established, are difficult to 
change once children enter school". The argument is that there is a higher return to investments made in the 
early years, as compared to later on in the life course. This is controversial, and will be partly discussed in 
the policy section below. One important issue is whether gains from early interventions persist or tend to 
decay if not supplemented by further measures, and this is an issue that remains far from resolved. 
However, at this juncture, the key point to take away is that there exist significant gaps in cognitive and 
non-cognitive skills that arise even before school, that the gaps are strongly linked to social disadvantage 
and family background, and that 'quality' early childhood education may play a role in narrowing them. Compulsory education 20. 
The test score gaps evident in the early years continue to develop and widen in the school years. 
In academic work and in the policy arena the links between education experiences and measures of 
childhood disadvantage have long been recognised. Empirical research on education and social 
disadvantage has often linked observable measures of educational achievement to various aspects of 
disadvantage. These include (among others): child poverty; parental education and income; parental 
attitudes; neighbourhood factors. There is a by now sizable body of evidence (Currie, 1995; Gregg and 
Machin, 1999, 2001) that educational achievement is significantly lower for children from disadvantaged 
backgrounds. This includes a higher probability of dropping out of school, lower qualification attainment 
and lower test scores at various ages through the school years. These gaps are present even in studies that 
condition on the early age (pre-school or at or near school starting ages) test scores of children. 21. 
There is a lot of evidence showing that children from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds do 
worse in terms of educational attainment through the school years or in terms of education levels achieved 
at the compulsory school-leaving age. Much of this comes from studies based upon single countries. 
However, with some of the data sources on international test scores of school-age children one can draw 
some international comparisons to illustrate the almost universal strong links between pupil achievement 
and family background. Figure 1 shows family background effects on test scores from an interesting recent 
paper by Schuetz, Ursrpung and Woessman (2005). This uses cross-country data from the Third 
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) from 1995 and its repeat survey from 1999. In 53 
out of 54 countries the family background effect is statistically significant and the implied gaps in test 
scores are large. Moreover, the estimates are internationally comparable and show very large family 
background effects in some countries. The largest family background effects are in England and, whilst all 
show an important family background gradient, there is a fairly wide range of estimates (and the relative 
positions may be sensitive to the use of TIMSS data as compared to other survey data on pupil 
achievement). 10 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Figure 1. Estimated effects of family background of students' test scores across countries 0

Kuwa it Note. Family background effects are based on reported measures of the number of books at home; test scores are 
average maths and science scores from TIMSS. The family background effects are estimated from statistical 
regressions explaining standardised test scores based on the number of books at home. As standardised test scores 
have an international standard deviation of 100, these effects can be interpreted as percentages of an international 
standard deviation by which test achievement increases if the number of books is raised by one category. The authors 
validate these estimates by also looking at other measures of family background from the 2001 Progress in 
International Reading Literacy Survey (PIRLS). Source: Scheutz, Ursprung and Woessman (2005). 22. 
A recent interesting strand of work in this area focuses on non-cognitive skills (like social skills 
and motivation) and their role in affecting education and life chances. A body of work by Heckman and 
colleagues (Carneiro and Heckman, 2003, Heckman and Rubinstein, 2001, Heckman and Vtylacil, 2001) 
has shown that better non-cognitive skills, including many developed in the early years of life, also lead to 
improved educational outcomes. This confirms that the better development of cognitive and non-cognitive 
skills has scope to enhance educational performances. Post-compulsory education 23. 
Social disadvantage also matters for the phase of post-compulsory education, where it is evident 
that educational inequalities linked to family background tend to persist and become larger (Feinstein, 
2004). The likelihood of staying on after the compulsory school-leaving age is linked to family background 
and social disadvantage in many countries. Since participation in higher education enhances life chances 11 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 and success as an adult, this compounds the already wide inequalities linked to social disadvantage that 
arise in the childhood years. 24. 
There are a range of issues pertaining to the way in which social disadvantage lowers the 
probability of participating in higher education (or pushes people from such backgrounds into the lower 
quality end of the spectrum). Work looking at participation in higher education, or more specifically 
university attendance, has shown that people from lower income backgrounds have significantly lower 
participation rates (two recent example are Blanden and Gregg, 2004, for the United Kingdom; and Black 
and Sufi, 2002, for the United States). Whilst there are problems of comparability across countries, owing 
to data differences and to the different nature of higher education systems, Figure 2 shows difference in 
participation in tertiary education by parents' level of education for a range of countries. In all of them 
there are sizable gaps between participation rates of those from families with parents who themselves have 
tertiary levels of education as compared to parents with lower education levels. Figure 2. Youths participating in tertiary education by educational attainment of their parents, 1994-95 0 20 40 60 80 100 U

The other feature of post-compulsory education and its connection to social disadvantage is that 
people from poorer backgrounds who do participate tend to enrol on courses, or in institutions, that yield 
lower economic and social benefits. This includes a lower likelihood of studying at  " elite "  universities 
(Chevalier and Conlon, 2003) and also a higher probability of studying for a vocational qualification rather 
than an academic qualification (Conlon, 2002). Adult education and lifelong learning 26. 
Social disadvantages experienced earlier in life also impact strongly on adult life chances 
(Bynner and Feinstein, 2004). This is clearly bad for them and for national prosperity, and research has 
shown that education is an important factor in explaining why these basic skills deficiencies arise. 
Studying the characteristics of the low basic skills group amongst the adult population shows them to very 
clearly be those who left the school system at the compulsory school-leaving age, who typically have no 
educational qualifications, and who come from poorer and more disadvantaged social backgrounds. 12 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 27. 
Figure 3 shows rates of attendance in adult education by educational attainment. Participation 
rates are higher in all countries for the most educated. The lifelong learning process evidently is biased 
towards those that already have more education, and this has a reinforcing effect on the educational 
inequalities. Without exception, even in the Scandinavian countries where the adult education and training 
gap is narrower by education group, there seems less scope to alleviate problems linked to low educational 
levels and/or poor basic skills that emerge from the adult education system. Figure 3. Participation rate in non-formal job-related continuing education and training for the labour force

The persistence of these skills problems through adult life is not only bad news for the 
individuals concerned (in terms of unemployment, deprivation and so on) but also for their families, their 
children's educational performance and for the communities in which they live. Social disadvantage 
clearly has much wider and far-reaching implications since cycles of disadvantage can run across 
generations and through families and communities. The fact that education is so inherently connected to 
social disadvantage makes the scope for social policy that affects educational opportunities all the more 
important, even if their specific features should reflect the relative importance of the various factors that 
lead poor households to 'under-invest' in education (Box 2). 13 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Box 2. Reasons why the poor do not invest in education The interpretation of education gaps by family background has received a lot of research attention. A sizable, and 
often contentious, debate has considered whether family income in itself matters, or whether one can attribute lower 
education levels and post-compulsory participation to other factors of disadvantage (like those acquired much earlier 
on in life). For example, some authors (like Mayer, 1997) argue that it is not income per se that directly affects 
children's life chances, but rather the factors that cause parents to have low incomes. Whether this is the case, or that 
income does matter, it remains the case that one sees lower participation in higher education from people who grew up 
in a poorer, or more disadvantaged, family environment. This is therefore an important issue for social policy, although 
which view is more correct of course matters when thinking about an appropriate policy response. Lower levels of access to tertiary education have also been linked to the presence of family credit constraints, to 
different rates of time preference amongst people from different family backgrounds and to differing attitudes to debt. 
These are all factors that link to social disadvantage and unravelling their relative importance in explaining lower 
access and participation is not straightforward on the basis of existing empirical evidence. But all are issues that need 
to be considered, especially when considering policy options. III. 
Impact of education on economic and social outcomes 29. 
A large body of research over the years has studied the impact of education on a range of 
economic and social outcomes in adulthood. Amongst economists the principal focus has been on the way 
that education is valued in the labour market, especially in terms of the wage returns that accrue to higher 
education levels. This originates in the path-breaking work on human capital from the 1960s and 1970s 
(Becker, 1964) which developed an analytical framework explaining why individuals invest in education 
and training in a manner analogous to firms' investment in physical capital. Other social scientists have 
considered wider benefits from education, with particular focus placed on the connections between 
education and outcomes like health, crime and civic participation and engagement, often in the context of a 
wider agenda on social capital (with origins developed in Coleman, 1988, Putnam et al., 1993, and 
Fukuyama, 1995). Labour market outcomes 30. 
It is now well established that education is closely connected to better labour market outcomes. In 
economic terms, an individual's decision to invest more in education generally yields a positive and 
significant return to that investment (Becker, 1964, Mincer, 1974). This is, of course, a return that is 
private to the individual making the investment. 31. 
There is by now a lot of evidence that there are significant wage and employment returns to 
education. There is also evidence that the advantage provided by education has been increasing over time 
(at least in the recent past – in other periods, like the 1970s, the wage advantage from higher education 
actually fell in the face of rapid supply increases). Figure 4, reproduced from the 2005 OECD Education at 
a Glance, shows sizable wage differentials between those with a university degree as compared to those 
with upper secondary or post-secondary education levels. Table 1 shows the employment rates of graduates 
to be significantly higher than for non-graduates for a range of countries. Moreover, the labour market 
advantages of graduates are also improving over time: earnings differentials of persons aged 25-to-64 with 
tertiary education (relative to those of persons with upper secondary education) improved, on average, by 
around 3% in the four years to 2002, while earnings of persons with less than upper secondary education 
were stable or declining in a majority of OECD countries (OECD, 2005). 14 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Figure 4. Earnings differentials by educational attainment in 2002 University Degree Relative to Upper Secondary/Post-Secondary Non Tertiary Levels 0 4 8 12 16 20 B e l g i u m

There are some important issues of interpretation surrounding these labour market differentials. 
The empirical literature on the private wage returns to education is one of the largest areas of empirical 
microeconomics. Because of this, various issues of modelling and measurement are well understood. 1 One 
of the critical issues raised in this work is the need to ensure that there is a causal impact of education on 
wages so as to ensure it is education that matters in generating a 'true' return. It is important to understand 
the difference between the causal effect of education and simple correlations between education levels and 
wages (like those in Figure 4 and Table 1). As Blundell et al. put it, there is a need to "distinguish between 
the higher earnings that are observed for better-educated workers being caused by their higher education 
and individuals with greater earning capacity choosing to acquire more education" (Blundell et al., 2005). 1. 
Very good reviews and evidence covering these issues are given in Card (1999) and in Blundell et al. (2000, 
2005). 15 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Table 1. Employment rates by educational attainment Upper secondary education ISCED 3C

Various empirical strategies have been devised to identify the 'causal impact' of education on 
earnings and the approaches used are much better developed than in many other areas of empirical work in 
the social sciences. 2 Existing evidence shows that there is indeed a sizable wage return to education. This is 
true in studies set in different time periods, in different countries and for different demographic groups. Of 
course, the estimated returns do differ with observable characteristics (e.g. returns to university degrees 
vary according to university attended and subject studied), but there is clear evidence of a significant 2. 
Many of the methods are quite technical in nature, but the key feature is to ensure that one eliminates any 
possibility of reverse causation running from education to wages. Of the strategies used, there have been 
statistical methods to ensure education is an exogenous variable (these are known as instrumental variable, IV, 
strategies), studies looking at twins and siblings so as to eliminate common family effects, and those that 
exploit policy variations that raise people's education levels independent of their choices (e.g. raising of 
compulsory school-leaving ages, again in an IV type approach). 16 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 positive wage return to education. This finding holds true when one adopts methods to ensure the direction 
of causality runs from education to earnings and not the other way around. Table 2 summarises some of the 
key papers in the field: in all cases the  " causal "  impacts, where researchers try and ensure variations in 
education are driven by factors that do not directly impact on wages, are above the 'basic' uncorrected 
differentials. Moreover, with few exceptions, the difference between the basic and causal returns is of 
similar magnitudes for the studies considered in the Table (although they obviously differ across studies 
owing to different data, different countries and so on). Hence, there is robust cross-country evidence that 
the more educated get higher monetary rewards in the labour market. Table 2. Evidence on the causal impact of education on earnings Study

The evidence discussed in Section II showed that education levels are significantly lower for 
people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The fact that education raises earnings power in the labour 
market thus shows how social disadvantage works through education to generate lower income for people 
from less advantaged backgrounds. This is because people from disadvantaged backgrounds invest less in 
education than other people do and thus fewer of them accrue the wage gains associated with such 
investment. Social outcomes 35. 
Returns to individuals in terms of higher wages are only one part of the story in which education 
and social disadvantage interact to affect individuals' livelihoods and well-being. Investment in education 
can clearly impact on other outcomes, and generate externalities that can cause the private and social 
returns to diverge from one another. One way of thinking about this is to consider the impact of education 
on other non-wage economic and social outcomes. 36. 
Social science researchers have considered the wider benefits of education by studying 
connections between education and outcomes like health, crime, civic engagement and intergenerational 
effects on children's outcomes. There is evidence of important externalities, in that education significantly 
improves health outcomes (Grossman and Kaestner, 1997, Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973, Lleras-Muney, 
2005), is associated with lower crime levels (Lochner and Moretti, 2004, Feinstein and Sabates, 2005, 
Machin and Vujic, 2005) and enhances the extent of civic engagement and participation (Brehm and Rahn, 
1997, Bynner and Egerton, 2001, Bynner and Parsons, 1997, Dee, 2004). Moreover, there are important 
intergenerational effects of education of adults on the education of their children (Black, Devereux and 
Salvanes, 2005). Two examples of social effects of education are discussed below. 17 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Prevalence of income-poverty 37. 
How skills are distributed among the adult population can influence the prevalence and severity 
of income poverty. Data from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) of 1995 show that countries 
like the United Kingdom and the United States have very dense lower tails of the distribution of literacy 
skills among adults (including amongst younger adults), whereas in Sweden and Germany hardly any 
adults are at these low levels. These data also show that this is not a problem concentrated amongst older 
adults, since very poor literacy and numeracy levels are present amongst 16-to-25-year-olds in the United 
Kingdom and the United States. 3 Across the OECD area, countries where the "tail" in the distribution of 
skills among the adult population is largest also tend to experience higher poverty rates in a point in time

Literacy underachievement Income poverty rate Notes. Literacy underachievement refers to the percentage of active persons aged 25 to 65 who scored at literacy 
levels 1 and 2 of the document scale in the International Adult Literacy Survey (a survey undertaken in 23 participating 
countries over the 1994-98 period): according to experts, this represent a level of performance below the minimum 
level of competence needed to cope adequately with the complex demands of everyday life. Income-poverty rates 
represent the share of the population aged 18 to 65 with equivalised household disposable income below 50% of the 
median; data refer to the mid-1990s. Source: (IALS) and OECD questionnaire on income distribution and poverty. Intergenerational mobility 38. 
A small but ambitious body of work studies how children from different social backgrounds fare 
as they progress through the school years. The focus is usually on the scope to escape from disadvantage. 
Johnson and Reed (1996) look at cohort data from the British National Child Development Study (NCDS) 4 3. 
For example, 22% of 16-25 year olds in Britain have literacy levels below IALS Level 2, compared to 19% of 
36-45 year olds; comparable numbers for the United States are 26% for 16-25 year olds and 18% for 36-45 
year olds. In Sweden 5% of 16-25 year olds are below Level 2, and in Germany the corresponding number is 
4%. The same pattern is true of numeracy skills. See OECD (1995). 4. 
NCDS is a birth cohort surveying all people born in a week of March 1958 at various ages (7, 11, 16 23, 33 
and 42 at the time of writing). 18 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 to study the relationship between sons and fathers and their position in the income distribution. They pay 
particular attention to those who start or end up near the top or bottom of the distribution and find that 
cohort members at these extreme ends of the distribution are particularly subject to immobility across the 
generations. Whilst this shows the scope to escape from a low-income background to be limited, they also 
show there to be a positive relationship between test scores at age seven and the likelihood of moving up 
the distribution among those whose fathers are at the bottom of the distribution. Thus, better cognitive 
skills, as measured by the NCDS test scores, are key to escaping, even at relatively early ages. 39. 
Other work has stressed that there are international differences in the extent of intergenerational 
mobility of economic and social outcomes. Countries with higher levels of social mobility also have 
education systems that seem to do better at ensuring educational equalities. Social mobility is higher in the 
Scandinavian countries, at intermediate levels in Germany, and at its lowest in the United Kingdom and the 
United States (Solon, 2002). Table 3 shows some recent estimates that try to ensure international 
comparability in terms of the outcomes of interest and the samples used. The estimates relate sons' earnings 
to fathers' earnings, where a higher partial correlation corresponds to a stronger cross-generation 
dependence of sons' earnings on fathers' earnings, i.e. lower intergenerational mobility. The Table makes it 
evident that countries with less intergenerational income mobility are also those identified earlier as being 
characterised by sizable tails at the lower end of the distributions of literacy and numeracy skills. Table 3. International estimates of intergenerational income mobility Country

Changing patterns of education and income inequalities also have implications for future patterns 
of social mobility. Indeed, evidence for the United Kingdom has shown that the combination of rapid 
educational upgrading and increased returns to human capital over time has led to falling social mobility 
(Blanden, Gregg and Machin, 2005a, 2005b). When education expansion favours individuals from richer 
family backgrounds (as in the United Kingdom, see Blanden and Machin, 2004), this acts to reinforce 
income persistence across generations and depress the prospects for social mobility. It is evident that this 
has strong implications for the design and implementation of social policy. 41. 
To summarise, the existence of important effects of education on economic and social outcomes 
strengthens what was said about the role of education, and its interaction with social disadvantage, in the 
context of the private wage returns. If social disadvantages can be mediated and offset by improved 
education, this can also generate wider benefits in terms of better health, crime and social capital outcomes, 
together with potential intergenerational effects that can temper the deleterious effects resulting from cross-
generational cycles of disadvantage. IV. 
Policy perspective 42. 
The research findings discussed in the previous two sections have direct implications for the 
design of education and social policy. The connections between education and life chances, and the myriad 
of dimensions of social disadvantage, mean that one needs to gear a policy discussion towards aspects of 
social policy that focus on education and towards aspects of educational policies that will impact on social 
disadvantage in later life. More generally, it is important to focus on altering the extent of disadvantage 19 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 within society. Central to this is the links to policy interventions and how they have been evaluated by 
social science researchers. In this respect, one needs to acknowledge that there are important, but often 
complex, complementarities that characterise education and social policies. Education policies 43. 
Considering longer term aspects of policy, it is evident that education policies can be designed 
with an aim of offsetting the key aspects of family disadvantage that hold back educational achievement. 
At what stage of the life-cycle such interventions are targeted and at what particular aspects of education 
are important questions to be resolved. Similarly whether they are directed at formal types of learning, or at 
non-formal types of learning, is important, though relatively under-studied. 44. 
Remedying disadvantages in access to better quality education – both at the compulsory and non-
compulsory stages of the education sequence, and indeed in the pre-school phase – can be rationalised for 
reasons of both social justice and efficiency, if more able children from poorer backgrounds miss out due 
to disadvantage. Given the evidence that educational achievement is strongly tied to both cognitive and 
non-cognitive skills of children, this is in line with the notion that educational policy interventions can 
enhance the life chances of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. 45. 
The question of timing is important. Indeed, social scientists from various disciplines (and of all 
political persuasions) acknowledge that high payoffs can result from spending on early childhood 
programs. Indeed some argue these are the only worthwhile interventions (e.g. Heckman's work argues 
inequalities in skills attributable to social and family backgrounds are already established before children 
enter school). But others argue that these payoffs decay rapidly unless bolstered with interventions that can 
continually offset social disadvantages through the whole education sequence. 46. 
Comparing the somewhat narrower focus on benefits considered by economists with the wider 
benefits from education that are considered in other social science disciplines leads to a recognition that 
there are aspects of formal and non-formal education that can enhance life chances. The formal route (for 
example, through learning mechanisms that generate educational qualifications) tends to be emphasised in 
the human capital work which views education and schooling as an investment that individuals decide 
whether or not to undertake. Non-formal learning experiences, on the other hand, tend to be more relevant 
to social capital discussions where individuals can glean non-monetary benefits that can enhance their life 
chances by participating in the learning experience itself. 47. 
The issue of adult, or lifelong, learning is also a relevant policy question. As the earlier 
discussion made clear, large numbers of adults in some countries are hampered by severe deficiencies in 
basic skills. Adult training and learning programmes are important aspects of education policy that can, if 
effective, act to offset these deficiencies to the benefit of the individuals concerned and importantly to their 
families. If they can offset the externality created by intergenerational persistence in low educational 
achievement, then these are an important aspect of education policy. 48. 
The different organisation of education systems across countries is also a policy-relevant factor. 
For example, in some countries schools have much more equitable admissions policies than in others. Of 
course, the role of the school itself is a hotly contested issue, especially in the education field, yet most of 
the school effectiveness work (Chevalier, Dolton and Levacic, 2005, Mortimore, 1991, Sammons, 1999, 
Teddlie and Reynolds, 1999) concludes that which school children attend does matter, even if family issues 
and peer effects may matter more. This can also have an important bearing on the life chances of children 
once they enter adulthood, especially if peer groups have a long-standing influence on economic and social 
outcomes. 20 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 Social policies 49. 
The other relevant dimension concerns policies aimed at the key aspects of social disadvantage. 
This is important since, as already noted above, education policies alone may not get to the causes of 
reduced life chances that have their sources in social disadvantage. Policies here include welfare and 
welfare-to-work policies that can enhance family income and lower child poverty which, in turn, can 
improve the educational attainment of children, subject to the debate in the academic literature about 
whether income per se or the characteristics of people that generate low income matter most. If the role of 
income is lower, and it is in fact characteristics that matter more, then structural factors like poor housing 
stock, the local labour market and poor transport access may matter for people in poor neighbourhoods and 
communities. For these individuals in impoverished situations, social policies linked to disadvantage that 
can have the scope to enhance children's educational performance would be those that are able to alter 
parental attitudes to education (e.g. through parenting programmes) or through community based out-of-
school programmes (e.g. summer programmes) that can influence the peer groups of children. 50. 
Overall, it is how the links between education and social disadvantage generate reduced life 
chances that matters for the policy discussion. The academic research is able to shed light on how such 
mechanisms may occur and thus to provide some insight into the relative merits of educational policies or 
other social policies aimed specifically at social disadvantage. A careful reading of the research, together 
with systematic evaluations of what actual policy interventions are able to do, is key to better 
understanding the need for social policy to be used to offset the reduced life chances of individuals from 
low education and poor social backgrounds. 51. 
It is evident that there are some social policies that have more scope to impact on learning of 
people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Whilst these are different in the different educational contexts in 
different countries, there are several of these: scope for offering cash transfers to families with children that 
are conditional on sending children to school; learning programmes targeted at youths who dropped out of 
formal schools; adult training; and, particularly for relatively unskilled workers, policies that provide 
recognition for competences learned on-the-job. Evaluation of policy interventions 52. 
The policy discussion above introduced various options that are relevant to the connections 
between education and social disadvantage, and especially to how they influence economic and social 
outcomes across the life course. A key aspect of policy design, however, is that policies are evaluated 
using rigorous and scientifically sound methods. This is important to learn what works and what does not 
work in ameliorating the bad effects of poor education and social disadvantage on an individual's life 
chances. 53. 
This is better recognised by policymakers in some countries and in some government 
departments than in others. Since governments spend sizable amounts of money on policy interventions in 
many areas, it is important to work out whether or not policies are cost-effective. Clearly developing 
policies that can be evaluated in a more systematic way is crucial to this. 54. 
To many people the 'gold standard' of evaluation methods for policy interventions is to run 
randomized experiments where some people randomly are selected into a policy and others are not. One 
can then carry out a comparison in an analogous way to medical trials by comparing outcomes in the 
treatment group (those in the programme) to those in the control group (those not in the programme). If the 
selection is truly random, then this should give an accurate estimate of the impact of the policy 
intervention. 21 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 55. 
However, randomized control trials are often highly specific, owing to their very costly nature 
and are difficult to generalise from. They often raise many ethical considerations that mean they are simply 
not viewed as feasible in the social science arena of many countries. Nonetheless it seems fair to say that, 
in the right circumstances randomization can be an attractive, and conceptually appealing, possibility and 
one that governments should be more open to pursue. 56. 
However, the line that we require random experiments to be conducted as the only means to 
effectively test policy interventions seems to be rather heroic. First of all, there are instances where random 
experiments are neither feasible nor ethical. Second, closer involvement by potential evaluators in the 
design of policies would seem desirable as a means to better understand what can work. Many policies are 
currently evaluated ex-post, yet a better evaluation may result if potential evaluators were involved ex-ante. 
Thirdly, there are very good examples of non-experimental evaluations that have been conducted without 
randomization. Evidence from evaluations 5 57. 
A lot of work looks at the evaluation of education interventions administered both in and outside 
school settings. For this review on education and social disadvantage, there are a number of evidence bases 
that are relevant. These include: school-based programmes; student support; and programmes for adults 
and drop outs. I consider each in turn, with an aim to generate an understanding of what we know about the 
effectiveness of policies aimed at improving the learning experiences of those coming from disadvantaged 
backgrounds. School-based programmes 58. 
Lavy and Schlosser (2005) argue that, although there have been a large number of interventions 
targeting disadvantaged students in recent years, evidence of their effectiveness remains scanty. Most 
studies are based on small samples and lack proper counterfactuals and cost-benefit analyses. Particularly 
important is the lack of evidence on how effective high-school interventions are, given the debate over the 
relative merit of late versus early childhood interventions (see, for example, Carneiro and Heckman, 2003). 59. 
Research by Lavy and Schlosser (2005) and Lavy (2002) helps to address this problem. These 
authors evaluate a programme of remedial education for underperforming high-school students in Israel 
(implemented since 1999). The objective of this programme is to increase the percentage of students who 
earn matriculation certificates, mainly by means of an increase in instruction time for targeted students. 
Classes were held for these students after school hours and taught by the classroom teachers. Lavy and 
Schlosser (2005) evaluate the programme using a quasi-experimental design: they compare outcomes for a 
'treatment' group and an appropriate 'comparison group' before and after the policy was implemented 
(i.e. a difference-in-differences analysis). They find the policy to be highly effective in improving 
outcomes at a cost of $300 per 12 th grade student ($1 000 per targeted student). The group incentive 
programme is evaluated in Lavy (2002), where he also evaluates a more conventional programme based on 
providing schools with additional resources to increase teaching time, split up classes into smaller study 
groups and provide extra coaching for weaker students. He finds that overall the estimated effect of the 
resources programme is greater than the 'group incentive programme' (though not on every measure), but 
that the cost is over twice as high (i.e. > $340 per student) and is less cost-effective. 60. 
The positive evidence for Israel is in marked contrast to that for the United States, where there 
are many examples of anti-dropout programmes for American teenagers that have failed to have any 
impact on graduation rates. These studies are reviewed by Dynarski and Gleason (1998). The largest 5. 
This Section draws on, and in places reproduces, some of my work on education policy with Sandra McNally. 22 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 federal dropout grants went to efforts to re-structure schools and in general the impact on student outcomes 
was negligible. A criticism of why the policy did not seem effective is that funding was spread too thinly 
across a very large number of schools. This issue of a diffuse spreading of resources across schools is also 
discussed by Bénabou et al. (2005) in relation to a similar area-based policy in France.  " Zones d'Éducation 
Prioritaire'' (ZEP; Priority Education Zones) was launched in 1982 to give greater resources to schools in 
disadvantaged areas. The programme was greatly extended thereafter. There was no clear basis for how 
money was allocated to schools or what it should be used for. The authors estimate that about three-
quarters was used for teacher bonuses (not related to performance) and one quarter for extra hours of 
teaching. However, the policy had no discernible impact on any of the measures of student achievement. 
Problems include the fact that ZEP status seemed to stigmatize the school (with some reaction from parents 
and teachers); considerable uncertainty over budgets; and a poor targeting of resources. 61. 
Similar policies have been implemented in England since the late 1990s. The establishment of 
Education Action Zones (EAZ) was the first such initiative. Each zone (usually 2 or 3 secondary schools 
plus their feeder primary schools) was to be run by a number of 'partners', including the local authority, 
businesses, the voluntary sector and community representatives. The EAZ initiative was effectively 
replaced by the (much larger) Excellence in Cities (EiC) initiative after a relatively short period. The 
funding of both schemes is about £120 per pupil on average – although there is considerably heterogeneity 
between schools and not all pupils will be directly affected by the extra funding. There are a number of 
components to EiC (some of which have changed over time). The main strands are the employment of 
'Learning Mentors', to help students overcome educational or behavioural problems; the provision of 
'Learning Support Units' to provide short-time teaching and support programmes for difficult pupils; and a 
'Gifted and Talented programme' to provide extra support for 5-10% of pupils in each school. There is 
also provision to designate more schools as 'Specialist' (i.e. in particular subjects) or 'Beacon' (to 
disseminate good practice). The evaluation evidence for EAZ is mainly qualitative (see Halpin et al, 2004; 
OFSTED, 2003) and findings are largely negative. The report by OFSTED (2003) suggests that this was 
due to an over-ambitious programme of activities that did not always focus specifically or radically enough 
on the challenges faced by schools in their areas. In contrast, evaluation evidence for EiC shows that the 
policy has been effective in raising pupil attainment in examinations and increasing attendance at school. 
Initial results suggested that EiC had a modest positive impact after about two years (Machin et al., 2004). 62. 
In conclusion, available evidence suggests that some school-based policies can be effective in 
raising the performance of disadvantaged students and that this can be done cost-effectively. But, for 
programmes to be successful, it matters greatly how the extra resources are spent and that they are 
appropriately targeted. Student support 63. 
Another type of measure used to increase the educational attainment of disadvantaged students is 
to offer financial incentives with one of more of the following aims: to improve attainment; to discourage 
drop-out; to encourage staying-on in education beyond compulsory school-leaving. An alternative (or 
sometimes additional) strategy has been to provide students with mentors. 64. 
In Israel, Angrist and Lavy (2002) evaluate the impact of offering students financial incentives 
for achieving their matriculation certificate. Such an incentive may be helpful if low-achieving students 
have high discount rates, reduce investment in schooling by going to work or face peer pressure not to 
study. The evaluation was done by means of randomized experiment. The analysis leads them to conclude 
that, although the evidence is not seamless, worthwhile gains in matriculation rates can be obtained by 
offering cash rewards in low-achieving schools. The award, worth about $1 429, was paid to 27% of the 
treatment group (which gives a cost of $385 per treated student). They estimate that the programme should 23 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 increase annual earnings in the treated group by about $282 per year – so the cost of the bonus will be 
quickly recovered. 65. 
In the United Kingdom, there are also (means-tested) payments given to students to stay on in 
education beyond the age of compulsory school-leaving. This is justified on the basis that many young 
people do not pursue further education because of financial constraints. The education subsidy programme, 
known as the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), was first piloted in a number of areas in England 
from September 1999. It has been carefully evaluated by means of a treatment-control design, using 
methods to ensure that the control group has similar observable characteristics to the treatment group in the 
baseline period. Dearden et al. (2005) report on the findings and show that the impact of the subsidy is 
quite substantial, with initial participation rates (at age 16/17) being around 4.5 percentage points higher 
than they would have been otherwise. Furthermore, this increase has drawn back to schooling young 
people from both employment and the inactivity group in equal parts – which shows that to a large extent 
the policy is not displacing individuals from work but from unproductive activities. They present a back-
of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis and suggest that the net benefits are positive. 66. 
There are many studies about the effect of financial aid on the probability of attending college in 
the United States. Dynarski (2005) argues that most of these are plagued by identification problems, with 
the analyses failing to control for the correlation between college costs and the unobserved determinants of 
schooling outcomes. She states that a handful of well-identified studies have established a strong causal 
link between schooling costs and college attendance. In an earlier paper where she reviews this literature, 
Dynarski (2002) concludes that best estimates suggest eligibility for $1 000 of subsidy increases college 
attendance rates by about 4 percent. However, it is not clear if the effect of such subsidies is higher or 
lower for low-income students. 67. 
Heckman and Lochner (2000) are more sceptical about the value of subsidizing low-income 
individuals to stay-on in education because they argue that credit constraints are not an important 
constraint for college-age youth from low-income families. However, they report evidence on the 
effectiveness of some programmes where provision of financial incentives was part of the reform package. 
For example, the 'Sponsor-A-Scholar' (SAS) programme was introduced in Philadelphia to help students 
from high school to enter college. The programme provides long-term mentoring (throughout high school 
and one year beyond), substantial academic support, help with college application and financial aid 
procedures and financial support for college-related expenses. $6 000 was offered to all students who went 
to college. Johnson (1998) estimated a 22% increase in college attendant for one year after graduation from 
high school (which fell back to 16% after two years). Impacts were greater for youth who were initially 
less successful academically, were having more school problems and had less family support. However, 
not all mentoring programmes are effective (Sipe, 1996). Reasons for lack of success include insufficient 
infrastructure to screen and monitor volunteer efforts or to match youth to appropriate mentors. 68. 
Among the other successful programmes discussed by Heckman and Lochner (2000) are the 
Quantum Opportunity Programme (QOP), which offered four years (high school years) of social and 
emotional support, together with financial assistance for individuals interested in post-secondary education 
or training. The QOP offered disadvantaged minority students financial incentives for every hour spent in 
activities aimed at improving social and market skills. The evaluation (based on randomized trials) found 
that two years after programme completion, about one-third more QOP participants graduated from high-
school (or obtained their GED) than similar non-participants. There was also a substantial reduction in 
crime – arrest rates for participants were half that of non-participants. The average four-year cost per 
participant was high, at $10 500. However, the cost-benefit analysis estimated positive net social returns 
(driven largely by the crime reduction aspect). 24 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 69. 
Finally, Heckman and Lochner (2000) discuss two other studies that they claim show that 
creative programmes designed to keep adolescents in school can be effective. Ohio's Learning, Earning 
and Parenting (LEAP) programme and Teenage Parent Demonstration (TPD) provided financial 
incentives for teenage parents on welfare to stay in school or take GED classes. Both programmes have 
been evaluated by randomized trials and show success in terms of high school graduation and earnings. 
Heckman and Lochner (2000) conclude that the much larger and broader benefits of QOP suggest that 
combining incentives with the academic and social support of a caring and qualified mentor provides the 
greatest promise for troubled adolescents. Programmes for adults and high-school drop-outs 70. 
Many programmes have been introduced to improve the earnings of the most disadvantaged in 
the general working-age population. They are diverse in nature and it is somewhat difficult to form an 
overall conclusion regarding their effectiveness, but I consider some of them in this sub-section. 71. 
There have been many evaluations of adult programmes in the United States and several reviews 
of the evidence including Friedlander et al. (1997), Heckman and Lochner (2000) and LaLonde (1995). In 
all three reviews, it is remarked that a modest investment has yielded a modest return; but that these 
programmes are insufficient to have much effect on poverty rates. As Friedlander et al. (1997) put it "the 
broadest generalization about the current knowledge of government training programmes for the 
disadvantaged is that they have produced modest positive effects on employment and earnings for adult 
men and women that are roughly commensurate with the modest amounts of resources expended on them". 
In their view, results from the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) evaluation are most important because 
the programme is national in scope and the survey design was experimental (and is considered 
demonstrably more reliable than the non-experimental studies in this literature). 72. 
Heckman and Lochner (2000) discuss the few training programmes that have demonstrated a 
positive impact on youth earnings. The most well-known is the Job Corps, an intensive programme 
($20 000 per participant) that provides extremely disadvantaged youth with basic education, vocational 
skills and a wide range of support services in a residential environment. The evaluation (Long, Mallar and 
Thornton, 1981) showed an increase in education, employment and earnings and estimated a net return of 
8-9% (though much of this is accounted for by a reduction in violent crime). More recent random 
assignment evaluations (Burghardt et al., 2001) show something of a more mixed picture for men (with 
gains occurring if they moved residence, but not for those on non-residential programmes) and earnings 
gains accruing to women participating the programme. 73. 
A similar programme, Jobstart, was designed to be a less intensive and less expensive version of 
this programme (with less intensive services in a non-residential setting). Although the cost was much 
lower ($6 000 per participant), so were the benefits. There was only a small overall impact on earnings, 
education and crime – though there were two particular sub-groups for which earnings returns were very 
high: men arrested between the age of 16 and programme entry; and youths who had dropped out of school 
for educational reasons. From their comparison of programmes, Heckman and Lochner (2000) draw the 
following conclusions: "you get what you pay for"; the effect of treatment may vary substantially among 
subgroups; and these types of programme have outcomes beyond schooling and work that should be 
considered such as a reduction in crime. 74. 
There are many training and education programmes for youth and adults in Europe (with a 
particular focus on the unemployed). Evaluation evidence is summarized by Ryan (2001a, 2001b). Unlike 
some of the US work, evaluation is not conducted using randomized experiments and generally, there is no 
cost-benefit analysis. However, there have been efforts to construct a valid treatment and comparison 
group (see, for example, Payne, 2000). In the United Kingdom, there were a number of programmes 25 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 implemented to train unemployed adults in the 1980s. Ryan (2001a) discusses evaluation of the Job 
Training Scheme (mid-80s), and the Employment Training and Training for Work programmes (1988-98). 
All programmes show substantial improvements in employment-related outcomes. However, they show no 
effect for earnings, apart from the Job Training Scheme, where some doubt is cast on the quality of the data 
and the matching of participants and non-participants in the evaluation. 75. 
With regard to youth programmes, evaluation evidence is extensive for France, Sweden and the 
United Kingdom (Ryan 2001b). In contrast to the United States, some programmes do report 
improvements in participants' employment prospects, as indicated by the incidence and duration of their 
subsequent experiences of employment and unemployment. Evidence on pay effects is mainly limited to 
Britain and several evaluations of the Youth Training Scheme have found that it reduced participants' 
earning power. Ryan (2001b) suggests that the difference between effects on unemployment and pay may 
reflect two factors: the general sensitivity of econometric findings to the choice of model and data; 
secondly, the tendency of European programmes to bring young people into contact with low-wage 
employers who offer little training, but who are prepared to hire many of them afterwards. 76. 
In conclusion, there is good evidence from the United States (mostly, though not exclusively, 
based on randomised experiments) that more intensive programmes can improve the education and skills 
of adults and thereby have a positive effect on earnings. Apart from a few notable exceptions, these 
programmes have had no impact on high-school dropouts. European evidence shows that such programmes 
can have employment impacts (both for adults and youth), but tend to show no positive impact for earnings 
(where this has been considered). General concerns in this literature are the reliability of the evaluation 
methodology (except for when randomised experiments are used); the short-term nature of many 
interventions and evaluations; wider effects that are not often considered by evaluators, such as crime and 
indirect effects (for example, consideration of whether employment programmes displace workers who 
would otherwise be employed). V. 
Concluding remarks 77. 
In this paper I have set out a discussion of the links between education experiences and social 
disadvantage, with a focus on how they impinge on individual's life chances and on how social policy is 
closed tied to this. The evidence from empirical research is that education and social disadvantage are 
closely connected and that people from less advantaged family backgrounds acquire significantly less 
education than their more advantaged counterparts. This translates into significantly reduced life chances 
as individuals' economic and social outcomes as adults are significantly hampered by lower education 
levels owing to social disadvantage. This includes poorer labour market outcomes, and significantly worse 
health, higher crime levels and lower levels of social capital. 78. 
Social policy is highly relevant to the worsened life chances resulting from low education and 
social disadvantage. Social policy can be highly complementary with education policy, and in some 
situations the combination of both may be needed to ensure effective intervention. There is clear scope to 
improve economic and social efficiency through appropriately designed policy interventions, as some of 
the policy evaluation work I have discussed makes clear. It is, however, absolutely crucial that 
policymakers carefully monitor and evaluate such interventions so as to get a better understanding of what 
can work in enhancing life chances from better education provision via the reduction of social 
disadvantage. Central to this is using rigorous and well-defined evaluation strategies to ascertain the 
effectiveness and payoffs that can result from education and social policy interventions. 26 DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2006)1 REFERENCES Angrist, J. and A. Krueger (1991),  " Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings " ,
