			<p>After a thorough review of the user needs in terms of indicators, a network of experts, comprising<lb/> official statisticians, worked at identifying the various data sources that could be utilised at national level to<lb/> build registers of doctoral graduates or produce statistical data. The expert group also worked with the<lb/> three intergovernmental organisations to develop the three components of the technical guidelines: a model<lb/> survey questionnaire, methodological guidelines and a set of output tables for collecting data at<lb/> international level.<lb/></p>

			<figure>After a pilot in 2005, two large scale data collections were conducted in 2007 and 2010 in which 25<lb/> countries participated each time and a rich set of data was made available and analysed. 1<lb/></figure>

			<p>Over the 2011-2012 bienium, the OECD activity on CDH has been partly sponsored by the European<lb/> Union&apos;s Seventh Framework Programme as part of the broad OECD KNOWINNO project. This supported<lb/> the development of the CDH database and indicators, the exploitation of CDH micro data and the revision<lb/> of the present guidelines.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the context of the 2010 CDH data collection cycle, the OECD has attempted to encourage the use of<lb/> microdata for purposes other than benchmark-type indicator construction and reporting, although<lb/> participation in this strand of work was constrained to a limited number of countries. Co-ordinated<lb/> microdata analysis can potentially secure policy relevant insights by discriminating between competing<lb/> explanations for observed patterns of research demand and supply in a way that indicators cannot.<lb/></p>

			<p>With very limited exceptions, CDH microdata remain by and large inaccessible to a very large pool of<lb/> potentially interested researchers. Countries should seriously consider the possibility of (a) anonymised<lb/> data being made available in standard research microdata repositories; (b) encouraging data linking to<lb/> other information such as bibliometrics data from within secure data enclaves; (c) encoding available<lb/> information such as company names to identify industrial activity codes and other information which are<lb/> currently missing from most surveys&apos; digitised data.<lb/> This working paper presents the third edition of the technical guidelines used in the framework of the<lb/> CDH project. Numerous comments and interactions with the participating countries following the 2007<lb/> and 2010 data collections have allowed adjustments to be made to the definitions used, wording of the<lb/> survey questions, presentation of the output tables, data to be reported and other methodological aspects. In<lb/> particular, this edition has benefitted from in-depth comments from the participants to the 2011-2012 EU<lb/> FP7 funded KNOWINNO project and presents new ways to measure competencies and skills of doctorate<lb/> holders through their knowledge, attributes and behaviours both at the time of their advanced research<lb/> degree completion and in their current employment.<lb/> This working paper is thus aimed at providing guidance to the countries that wish to participate in the<lb/> next CDH data collection exercise. It is also expected that new experiences with the model survey and<lb/> comparative analysis of the data, as they become available, will continue to shape the CDH guidelines in<lb/> the future.<lb/></p>

			<table>TABLE OF CONTENTS<lb/></table>

			<head>1.<lb/> INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Statistics on careers of doctorate holders (Statistics on CDH) are compiled with a view to measure the<lb/> demographic, employment, international and intra-sectoral mobility, career and earnings characteristics of<lb/> holders of advanced research qualifications at national and international level. In the present document, we<lb/> use the term &quot; doctorate holders &quot; for persons with an advanced research qualification, in possession of an<lb/> ISCED 1997 level 6 degree.<lb/> These statistics aim to answer questions about international mobility, which is an important aspect of<lb/> the labour of highly skilled workers and frequently referred to as brain drain, brain gain, or brain<lb/> circulation. In addition, issues about the qualitative and quantitative match of the education of doctorate<lb/> holders with the labour market are addressed. These statistics also deal with questions on how well the<lb/> competencies of the highest educated are used by the society as well as with the attractiveness of different<lb/> career paths for doctorate holders. Such questions are of interest at the worldwide level.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on an output-harmonised approach, the tabulated data to be delivered by countries to<lb/> international organisations may be compiled using different methodological approaches. Already existing<lb/> national surveys can often be used, which sometimes may need to be complemented or extended. These<lb/> guidelines therefore provide the general framework for national data production.<lb/> On the one hand, the guidelines should help countries to improve and align their national survey<lb/> methodologies. On the other hand, countries that are newly introducing CDH surveys will find directions<lb/> on how to do this at national level.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> PURPOSE OF STATISTICS ON CDH<lb/> 2.1<lb/> Why doctorate holders?<lb/></head>

			<p>Doctorate holders are the most highly educated group, and as such considered to have a high potential<lb/> to contribute to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and technologies. They are often seen as key<lb/> actors behind the creation of innovation and knowledge-based economic growth.<lb/> CDH statistics mainly focus on doctorate holders, but the same type of statistics may of course be<lb/> collected for other types of &quot; highly qualified people &quot; . This could for example be the case in some<lb/> developing countries where highly qualified non-doctorate holders may constitute a crucial part of the S&amp;T<lb/> workforce and thus a target group of policy interest. Some OECD countries have even started collecting<lb/> similar information for university graduates below the doctoral level.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> Needs expressed by users<lb/></head>

			<p>The user needs for statistics on CDH were thoroughly discussed during a series of workshops between<lb/> 2003 and 2011.<lb/> One of the aims of these workshops was to define links between research questions and data needs<lb/> thus setting the objectives for the data collection of statistics on CDH. The policy questions of interest at<lb/> the national and international level are summarised under the following four headings:<lb/></p>

			<head>• The role of doctorate holders in innovation and the knowledge economy<lb/></head>

			<p>Where do doctorate holders work as compared to other tertiary graduates? Do they follow research<lb/> careers and in what sector and field?<lb/></p>

			<head>• Labour market supply and demand<lb/></head>

			<p>Do we train too many or too few doctorate holders? Are there mismatches in the labour market?<lb/> Why do doctorate holders choose a research career in the public sector, or in the private sector or<lb/> leave research? What is their perception of career opportunities and employment in the public<lb/> versus the private sector? Do they earn more than the average citizen and which sectors of<lb/> employment are the most profitable?<lb/></p>

			<head>• Education to work<lb/></head>

			<p>How long is the time of transition to employment or post doctoral experience? How related is the<lb/> job to the doctoral degree?<lb/></p>

			<head>• Mobility<lb/></head>

			<p>How mobile are doctorate holders between sectors? When do doctorate holders leave research for<lb/> a career in management? How big are the flows of doctorate holders between countries? How<lb/> common is it for doctorate holders to reside in a country on a non-permanent basis? What are the<lb/> reasons for doctorate holders to return to their country of origin?<lb/></p>

			<p>With CDH statistics, policy makers should get much better information to address these questions.<lb/> Countries will be able to share information at the international level, having their expatriates covered in the<lb/> doctoral population observed by other countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3<lb/> The output harmonisation approach<lb/></head>

			<p>As national data compilation methods may be heterogeneous between countries, reflecting the<lb/> diversity of national statistical systems, a harmonisation effort is conducted on the output of the CDH<lb/> statistics together with a quality control.<lb/></p>

			<p>The aim is therefore to obtain high quality results through a harmonised list of variables and<lb/> indicators, together with their related definitions. The methodological guidelines additionally provide<lb/> guidance on the target population, sampling frames, sampling design, survey instruments etc. that should<lb/> be adopted at the national level.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4<lb/> Output tables and national methodology description<lb/></head>

			<p>The output tables to be compiled by countries consist of about 41 predefined tables available as Excel<lb/> spreadsheets, to be compiled at national level only.<lb/> A preliminary table is included to fill in metadata and country specificities, like reference year, data<lb/> collection method, coverage issues, contact details for institution and person responsible for CDH<lb/> statistics. The tables are organised in five broad groups, dealing with different aspects of doctorate holders.<lb/> This set of tables is expected to evolve as the project develops.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Personal characteristics P1-P8<lb/></head>

			<p>Break down the population of doctorate holders according to personal characteristics like age, sex,<lb/> country of citizenship and country of birth.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Educational characteristics ED1-ED6<lb/></head>

			<p>Information on the educational history of the doctorate holders: the population of doctorate holders<lb/> is broken down by country of doctorate award, country of prior education, field of doctorate degree<lb/> and source of funding during completion of doctorate. The compilation of average and median age<lb/> and number of years to completion of the doctoral degree are also part of the tables, as well as<lb/> information on the acquisition of certain competencies.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Labour force status and employment characteristics EMP1-EMP10/PERC1-PERC2<lb/></head>

			<p>Employment characteristics of doctorate holders, such as employment status (situation in<lb/> employment, type of contract, working time), employment in research, institutional sector, median<lb/> and average gross annual earnings, job mobility, competencies. Data on doctorate holders&apos;<lb/> perception of work and satisfaction are also requested in this group of tables.<lb/></p>

			<head>• International mobility: Inward and outward IMOB1-IMOB4/OMOB1-OMOB2 (outward tables are<lb/> optional)<lb/></head>

			<p>Tables on inward mobility collect information on the international mobile population of doctorate<lb/> holders according to their previous country of residence, their reasons for moving into or returning<lb/> to the country and the frequency and length of their mobility (either reported in number of years or<lb/> in number of months). Tables on outward mobility present the population of doctorate holders<lb/> broken down according to their intention and reasons to move out of the country in the next year.<lb/></p>

			<table>DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> • Scientific output OUTP1-OUTP2.<lb/> The scientific output of doctorate holders during the last three years in terms of total number of<lb/> articles, books, patents, start-up companies and commercialisation of patents.<lb/></table>

			<p>For each output table, two columns are allocated to each variable, the first one to enter the data, the<lb/> second one devoted to standard flags attached to selected data. Reporting countries are invited to<lb/> use the flags where relevant in the columns next to the data when filling in the output tables.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the end of each separate table, space is also allocated to enter information on data sources and<lb/> applied definitions and classifications. Where relevant, the variables from the questionnaire that<lb/> were used should be reported. Countries are also asked to provide additional information on the<lb/> statistical surveys and administrative data sources used in a separate document, the national<lb/> methodology description (Annex 2). This metadata information together with the preliminary table<lb/> information is critical to interpret the data in the tabulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> THE TARGET POPULATION<lb/> 3.1<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The target population is a decisive element of the international comparability of CDH statistics. The<lb/> survey frame and the statistics itself are often put together from different national sources and surveys,<lb/> each with its own survey population.<lb/> Different countries are at different stages of development of the CDH statistics as regards the full<lb/> coverage of the target population. In a transitional phase where countries make efforts to fully implement<lb/> the methodological guidelines, incomplete coverage of the target population is accepted. This is however at<lb/> the expense of comparability of the data between countries. Care should be taken to limit incomplete<lb/> coverage as the project evolves and national practices are harmonised.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Definition of the target population<lb/></head>

			<p>The total target population of the CDH statistics consists of all individuals with an education at<lb/> ISCED 1997 level 6. This global population of holders of advanced research qualifications is divided into<lb/> national populations, which are considered the target populations of national surveys in each country. The<lb/> national target populations consist of individuals that at the reference date are fulfilling the following<lb/> criteria:<lb/></p>

			<p>• having an education at ISCED 1997 level 6 (doctorate) obtained anywhere in the world, and<lb/> • being resident (permanent or non-permanent) within the national borders of the surveying country.<lb/></p>

			<p>With these definitions and the (theoretical) assumption that all countries are conducting the survey<lb/> and using the same date of reference, the whole population of doctorate holders resident in all countries is<lb/> covered without any overlaps.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3<lb/> Reference year<lb/></head>

			<p>The recommended reference year is 2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4<lb/> Reference day<lb/></head>

			<p>The recommended reference day, i.e. point in time to which the measured observation (e.g. length of<lb/> stay in the reporting country) refers, is 1 December of the year before the year that the survey is conducted<lb/> at national level. The recommended reference day therefore for the 2013 data collection is 1 December<lb/> 2012. In exceptional cases, the data compiling country is free to choose another reference date, but it<lb/> should preferably be chosen as close to 1 December as possible, between 1 October and 31 December.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.5<lb/> Reference periods<lb/></head>

			<p>For the sake of international comparability, it is recommended that countries collect data in a way that<lb/> the requested reference periods are equal to calendar years and start or end as close to the reference date as<lb/> possible.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.6<lb/> Statistical units<lb/></head>

			<p>The statistical unit is the single individual having a formal education at ISCED 1997 level 6 (awarded<lb/> doctorate) and being resident (permanent or non-permanent) in the reporting country on the reference date.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.7<lb/> The age dimension<lb/></head>

			<p>Countries should only include doctorate holders with an age below 70 years (i.e. up to 69 years old) in<lb/> the target population. Although many highly skilled people tend to work, and contribute to society with<lb/> skills and knowledge at higher ages, one of the main aims of the CDH data collection is to look at the<lb/> situation of doctorate holders in the labour force (i.e. before retirement).<lb/> If countries want to study doctorate holders over 70, they should be sampled separately and not<lb/> reported in the output tables. Countries should leave this category out of the figures reported as national<lb/> totals.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8<lb/> Active and inactive doctorate holders<lb/></head>

			<p>The national target population should include economically active doctorate holders as well as the<lb/> economically inactive as long as they are below the age limit.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.9<lb/> Structure of the target population<lb/></head>

			<p>The population of doctorate holders residing in the surveying (country X) is structured in four broad<lb/> groups namely:<lb/></p>

			<head>Target population, residents in country X:<lb/></head>

			<p>A. Citizens of country X with a doctorate awarded within country X.<lb/> B. Citizens of foreign countries with a doctorate awarded in country X.<lb/> C. Citizens of country X with a doctorate awarded abroad.<lb/> D. Citizens of foreign countries with a doctorate awarded abroad.<lb/> Two additional groups of doctorate holders related to, but not belonging to the target population of<lb/> country X, are defined as follows:<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-target population, residents outside country X:<lb/></head>

			<p>E. Citizens of country X with a doctorate awarded within country X who have left country X.<lb/> F. Citizens of foreign countries with a doctorate awarded in country X who have left country X.<lb/> In general, the sub-populations E and F are taken into consideration in the reporting countries where<lb/> these doctorate holders are resident. For this reason and because of the general difficulties to trace these<lb/> doctorate holders across borders, countries are not requested to report information on the doctorate holders,<lb/> resident outside the national borders.<lb/></p>

			<table>COUNTRY X<lb/> A. Nationals who<lb/> have graduated in<lb/> country X<lb/> B.<lb/> Foreigners<lb/> who have<lb/> graduated in<lb/> country X<lb/> D. Foreigners<lb/> who have<lb/> graduated<lb/> abroad, resident<lb/> in country X<lb/> C. Nationals<lb/> who have<lb/> graduated<lb/> abroad, resident<lb/> in country X<lb/> E. National graduates<lb/> who have left country X<lb/> F. Foreign graduates who<lb/> have left country X<lb/> 3.10<lb/> Recent doctorate recipients<lb/> A sub-population of particular interest are recent doctorate recipients. These are defined as the<lb/> population of doctorate holders that have been awarded their doctoral during the last two years. Therefore,<lb/> a recent doctorate recipient is a person who received his/her doctorate degree at any time between January<lb/> 201X-1 and December 201X, where 1 December 201X is the reference date for the survey. Indicators<lb/> specifically related to this population are age at graduation, time to completion, source of funding,<lb/> employment status and gross annual earnings.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> 4.<lb/> SURVEY METHODOLOGY<lb/></table>

			<head>4.1<lb/> Data collection at the national level<lb/></head>

			<p>Data compilation methods are expected to differ from one country to another as a consequence of the<lb/> different types of data sources or registers available to identify and survey doctorate holders.<lb/> Possible national data sources are surveys targeting university graduates, housing and population<lb/> censuses, labour force surveys, migration statistics, R&amp;D statistics, etc. Gaps between the data available<lb/> and the data requested need to be identified and addressed. Existing surveys could be extended or new<lb/> complementary surveys launched.<lb/> Metadata on CDH statistics are collected in order to assess the quality of the tabulated data delivered.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2<lb/> Sampling frames for surveys on doctorate holders<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to obtain the best possible coverage of the target population, statisticians may have to rely on<lb/> several national sources to build their sampling frames since these sources are targeting different sub-<lb/>groups of the population of doctorate holders.<lb/> Possible overlaps between sources should be identified and remedied. For this purpose, information<lb/> that makes it possible to unambiguously identify the same individual in multiple sources like e.g. name,<lb/> year of award and date of birth could be used.<lb/> The establishment of a national register of doctorate holders, resident in the country, irrespectively of<lb/> country of doctorate award, with a mechanism to update it systematically, is recommended for the<lb/> elaboration of complete sampling frames. Some countries have already invested effort and resources in that<lb/> direction.<lb/> A list of possible sources for building sampling frames for CDH related surveys is presented below.<lb/> More sources may be identified as the project evolves (when more national metadata become available).<lb/></p>

			<head>• National registers of education<lb/></head>

			<p>If a national register of education is available, this is one of the best possible sampling frames. The<lb/> Swedish register of education, constantly updated with information on postgraduate exams from<lb/> national universities and annually with information on the educational attainment of new<lb/> immigrants, is an example of a source for a sampling frame that includes the entire target<lb/> population.<lb/></p>

			<head>• National universities<lb/></head>

			<p>University information systems provide sources for sampling frames that usually consists of high-<lb/>quality administrative-based information on the educational characteristics of doctorate holders as<lb/> well as on personal data, including addresses and phone numbers. These types of sources however<lb/> are not sufficient to cover doctorates awarded many years ago or doctorates awarded abroad. These<lb/> types of sources are for example used as sampling frame in the Canadian Survey of Earned<lb/></p>

			<head>Doctorates, the Danish survey PhDs in Natural Sciences and the Italian survey Employment of<lb/> PhDs of the University of Rome.<lb/> • Previously conducted surveys on doctorate holders<lb/></head>

			<p>This type of source can serve as a good basis to build the future sampling frame when<lb/> supplemented with recently awarded doctorate holders and other subgroups of the target<lb/> population not covered initially. The longitudinal panel Survey of Doctorate Recipients in the<lb/> United States is for example based on a sample of the annually conducted Survey of Earned<lb/> Doctorates.<lb/></p>

			<head>• International and national funding institutions<lb/></head>

			<p>Doctorate holders that have received scholarships during their studies might be identified and<lb/> reached through the funding organisations. For example, the Portuguese foundation for Science<lb/> and Technology is used to build a sampling frame in the survey PhDs in the labour market.<lb/></p>

			<head>• National libraries<lb/></head>

			<p>National libraries may be able to provide a list of theses of doctorates awarded within the country<lb/> together with information like name, university, field of science, and award year. In order to use<lb/> this list for the building up of the sampling frame, it probably needs to be complemented with<lb/> contact information from other sources. Iceland uses the list of PhD dissertations available to the<lb/> National and University Library in combination with other sources to compile the national register<lb/> of doctorate holders (RANNIS database).<lb/></p>

			<head>• Alumni organisations<lb/></head>

			<p>Since membership is not compulsory, alumni organisations will not provide a complete list of all<lb/> doctorate holders. Name and address registers can however hold recently updated information<lb/> making it suitable for tracing of individual doctorates holders. Alumni databases were used as<lb/> sampling frame in the German Brain Drain – Brain Gain Survey on International Job Careers.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Population and housing censuses<lb/></head>

			<p>One important source for building up a sampling frame is the housing and population census. This<lb/> survey in principle covers the complete target population, but some limitations can be expected:<lb/> e.g. low frequency of these surveys and, more importantly, the non-systematic separate<lb/> identification of doctorate holders in some countries. The 2005 Belgian CDH survey has used the<lb/> population and housing census as a sampling frame.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Central registers of foreign citizens<lb/></head>

			<p>If registers of foreign citizens are available, they should be used for building up the sampling<lb/> frame for CDH surveys, in particular with regard to doctorate holders with foreign citizenship.<lb/> This is only possible when the educational background of foreigners is registered, which is not<lb/> always the case. In combination with population and housing censuses, register of foreigners could<lb/> provide the link to population changes among foreign citizens (including doctorate holders) which<lb/> occurred since the reference date of the census.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/></p>

			<head>• R&amp;D statistics<lb/></head>

			<p>If an R&amp;D data collection is conducted, information on citizenship, field of science, formal<lb/> qualification and sector of employment might be available for doctorate holders that are employed<lb/> in research positions. The OECD requests this information and so does the European Commission,<lb/> where the concerned variables are included in the Commission regulation 753/2004 that applies to<lb/> the EEA countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Employment/business register<lb/></head>

			<p>National employment and business registers are used for approaching doctorate holders through<lb/> their employers. The registers comprise enterprises, organisations, institutions, etc., a first contact<lb/> where it is envisaged to identify those which employ doctorate holders. In combination with other<lb/> sources (e.g. university information systems), this approach works efficiently for tracking<lb/> doctorate holders awarded abroad. However, it is not sufficient to capture unemployed and inactive<lb/> doctorate holders.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Other surveys (LFS, EU-SILC, SBS, etc.)<lb/></head>

			<p>Other established surveys can be exploited in several ways for building the CDH sampling frame:<lb/> identify doctorate holders, identify firms, institutions, etc. which employ doctorate holders,<lb/> supplement administrative information (addresses, phone contacts, names, etc.) or other<lb/> information related to CDH (e.g. LFS collects information on education level and employment<lb/> status).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3<lb/> Survey types<lb/></head>

			<p>Beside the extensive use of administrative sources (which is possible in some countries), different<lb/> survey types could be considered when compiling information on educational history, mobility and careers<lb/> of doctorate holders. It is recommended to use all possible available sources that allow filling in the<lb/> information corresponding to the mandatory questions in the CDH model questionnaire. Described below<lb/> are the three main types of existing surveys: graduate surveys, cohort surveys and cross-sectional<lb/> retrospective surveys.<lb/></p>

			<p>These three survey types are ordered according to their degree of coverage of the target population.<lb/> Cross-sectional surveys are the most efficient in terms of coverage but some specific advantages could also<lb/> be identified in each of the other types. The three surveys should thus not be seen as mutually exclusive,<lb/> but rather complementary. Countries could opt for one or for a combination of surveys that provides the<lb/> most cost-efficient national data collection.<lb/></p>

			<p>The sampling frames and their qualities are of course of crucial importance for the quality of the<lb/> results. The complementary coverage of the different sampling frames used in the different survey types<lb/> needs to correspond to the CDH target population.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3.1<lb/> Graduate surveys<lb/></head>

			<p>Graduate surveys are surveys that capture information at the time upon graduation. This type of<lb/> survey is especially suitable for collecting information on the doctorate programme, the education history<lb/> and conditions during the years of study. A graduate survey is also the appropriate means for obtaining<lb/> information on post-graduation plans and could be the only point of contact with doctorate holders that<lb/> plan to leave the country, including those that return to their country of origin. No information however<lb/> can be gathered on long-time career developments and international mobility.<lb/> A graduate survey should preferably be conducted regularly on all nationally awarded doctorate<lb/> holders, including foreign citizens, as soon as possible after graduation. Information on educational history<lb/> and the doctorate programme itself (e.g. source of funding and time to completion) is best obtained as soon<lb/> after graduation as possible. Co-operation with the educational institutions should be sought to take<lb/> advantage of their information systems and establish contact with the respondents. If the educational<lb/> institutions could obtain survey results pertaining to their own graduates, their motivation to participate<lb/> should be high.<lb/> Records obtained through a graduate survey should be stored and used to build a register of nationally<lb/> awarded doctorate holders, which will not cover doctorate holders awarded abroad or doctorate holders<lb/> having graduated a long time ago, although the latter problem will diminish with the passage of time. Due<lb/> to this limitation, graduation surveys should always be used in combination with other survey types.<lb/> Besides being a useful source of information, such a register could also be used in the future to construct<lb/> sampling frames for cohort and cross-sectional surveys.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3.2<lb/> Cohort surveys<lb/></head>

			<p>Longitudinal cohort surveys have advantages in collecting up-to-date information about the training<lb/> and working activities undertaken by doctorate holders, by following a homogeneous population over time.<lb/> For instance, it can be assumed that individuals graduated in the same year will experience similar<lb/> conditions of the labour market in approaching job searching. Such longitudinal surveys should be ideally<lb/> carried out every two to three years.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, surveys on recent cohorts of doctorate holders can provide only limited<lb/> information about long-time career developments and international mobility, which can be better<lb/> investigated through a cross-sectional retrospective survey.<lb/></p>

			<p>A cohort survey could be conducted as a sample survey or a census. It should in principle include<lb/> doctorates awarded from all national institutions, including foreign citizens, currently unemployed and<lb/> inactive as well as doctorates entering the country having being awarded abroad. A cohort survey should<lb/> be based on a sampling frame where year of graduation is available.<lb/></p>

			<p>When new cohorts are regularly introduced and surveyed in parallel to older ones the coverage with<lb/> regard to the CDH target population will increase over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3.3<lb/> Cross-sectional retrospective surveys<lb/></head>

			<p>A cross-sectional survey should cover doctorate holders from many different cohorts, awarded within<lb/> the country and abroad. Through retrospective questions, the cross-sectional survey should provide a good<lb/> picture of the career paths of doctorate holders at different stages of their career. The cross-sectional survey<lb/> is thus the most appropriate tool if information on the entire target population is to be obtained through one<lb/> single survey or a follow-up of other established surveys which sufficiently cover doctorate holders (e.g.<lb/> LFS). In the latter case a sample or the total population of the identified doctorate holders will be surveyed<lb/> for the CDH specific needs.<lb/> Cross-sectional surveys have the potential to ensure complete coverage of the target population and<lb/> moreover to collect CDH specific information. Countries should make strong efforts to assure the full<lb/> coverage of all groups, including those that are more problematic to capture (doctorate holders awarded<lb/> abroad, inactive doctorate holders, unemployed doctorate holders, etc.).<lb/> The relevance of this type of survey should however be carefully assessed in terms of cost-<lb/>effectiveness, given that a survey for the needs of CDH needs to be established from scratch. Another<lb/> drawback with these surveys that should also be considered is the risk of recall bias; countries should make<lb/> an effort to minimize that risk.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4<lb/> Stratification<lb/></head>

			<p>Cohort surveys and graduate surveys should, if they are carried out as sample surveys, be stratified<lb/> according to at least two main criteria, graduating institution and sector of employment.<lb/></p>

			<p>For cross-sectional sample surveys, stratification is needed with regard to the structure of the target<lb/> population and the original data sources used to build the sampling frames.<lb/></p>

			<p>In statistical surveys, the number of domains needed often determines the number of strata. However,<lb/> for multipurpose statistics like the CDH statistics, the number of domains will often exceed the desirable<lb/> number of strata. Since too high a number of strata could lead to a problem with too few observations in<lb/> some strata, it is important to keep stratification at a reasonable level.<lb/></p>

			<p>The most obvious and significant stratification is to break down the population according to the<lb/> sampling frames applied. As strata should be as homogenous as possible with respect to the principal<lb/> variables analysed, further recommended breakdowns are according to the characteristics year of<lb/> graduation, fields of science, and gender.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.5<lb/> Allocation and sampling<lb/></head>

			<p>The allocation of the sample on the strata may be in principle proportional to the stratum size. If the<lb/> allocation ends up giving too small sample sizes in some strata, over-sampling may be considered. Over-<lb/>sampling might also be considered in strata where high levels of non-response could be expected.<lb/></p>

			<p>The total sample size should be chosen taking into account the detailed breakdowns in the output<lb/> indicators template. The selection of the sample should be based on random sampling techniques, with<lb/> known and equal selection probabilities being applied within each stratum. The random sampling<lb/> techniques should be without replacement within each stratum.<lb/> It is recommended that the total sample fraction (ratio of total sample size to total population size)<lb/> exceeds 20%. Smaller fractions could be accepted as long as the variance of estimation is restricted to<lb/> ensure accurate results.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> 24<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA<lb/> 5.1<lb/> Data collection methods<lb/></head>

			<p>When collecting CDH statistics, a mixed-mode data collection adapted to the possibilities available<lb/> within each country could be considered. This includes the use of existing data, postal and Internet surveys,<lb/> telephone interviews and personal interviews.<lb/></p>

			<p>Postal surveys are commonly used and have the advantage to be relatively inexpensive. Under some<lb/> circumstances, the delivery agent also may bring back information on the new addresses of people who<lb/> moved during the most recent past. Both postal and telephone reminders may be used to increase the<lb/> response rate.<lb/></p>

			<p>Computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and personal interviews (CAPI) are techniques where<lb/> interviewers play an active role in collecting information from respondents. Although quite costly, they<lb/> could be justified by the higher rates of response that they normally achieve. CATI and CAPI techniques<lb/> are especially useful in boosting the response rates of a postal survey.<lb/></p>

			<p>Many national practices exist where countries give the respondent the opportunity to fill in the<lb/> questionnaire in an electronic version on the Internet. The use of questionnaires that can be accessed on-<lb/>line is recommended as an alternative to other means of collection after contact with the respondent has<lb/> been established.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the special case of graduate surveys the relevant institutions should preferably be involved in the<lb/> data collection. The institutions could considerably facilitate the data collection process by distributing and<lb/> collecting the questionnaire together with their administrative requirements for graduations.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2<lb/> The CDH survey questionnaire<lb/></head>

			<p>Since CDH statistics are based on an output-harmonised approach, statisticians may decide what<lb/> survey instruments to use. However, a full model questionnaire is available, in an English version, with<lb/> questions adapted to the output indicator templates and definitions. A CDH dedicated survey using this<lb/> questionnaire is the best fitted instrument for providing the full range of CDH variables and should<lb/> preferably be adapted by the participating countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The questionnaire is divided into six different modules dealing with different aspects of the careers of<lb/> doctorate holders: doctoral education (EDU), early career research positions (ECR), employment situation<lb/> (EMP), international mobility (MOB), career related experience (CAR) and personal characteristics<lb/> (PER). In order to facilitate answering the questionnaire for the respondents, an instruction manual has<lb/> been developed as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>The model questionnaire is recommended for countries that are going to launch a self-standing CDH<lb/> survey. In addition, countries that want to revise their existing national questionnaires are encouraged to<lb/> align it by using the selection of questions presented in the model questionnaire. The first section of the<lb/> core model questionnaire presents instructions for adaptation of the model questionnaire to national needs,<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> pointing out necessary adaptations as well as options for the drafting of some questions. These instructions<lb/> should be carefully followed when applying the core model questionnaire at the country level. 2<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3<lb/> Coding of data values<lb/></head>

			<p>The definitions and the breakdowns within the CDH output tabulation determine what classifications<lb/> and nomenclatures are to be used. Complementary to the output tables, a list of the variables&apos; definitions<lb/> are available in the document Output indicators variables and definitions.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4<lb/> Data editing<lb/></head>

			<p>Throughout the data processing cycle, there should be a systematic and sustained follow-up with<lb/> respondents to make sure that the data provided is of good quality. Data quality checks have to be done<lb/> both at micro-and macro-level, before the data are finally processed and disseminated.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The model questionnaire is available on CIRCA site of Eurostat and the OECD CDH electronic discussion<lb/> group, and will soon be available on the UIS website as well.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/> ESTIMATION OF RESULTS AND DATA QUALITY<lb/> 6.1<lb/> Response rates<lb/></head>

			<p>Doctorate holders who do not respond to the CDH survey questionnaire may not only differ from<lb/> respondents in the characteristics measured, but non-response generally does not occur completely at<lb/> random. Therefore, all efforts have to be made to minimise unit non-response. Nevertheless, survey<lb/> budgets and potential non-response bias may influence the decisions made about the acceptable degree of<lb/> non-response and its treatment.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2<lb/> Unit non-response and non-response survey<lb/></head>

			<p>A non-response survey is recommended if the non-response rate, as an un-weighted percentage of all<lb/> sampled doctorate holders, exceeds a certain limit (e.g. 30%). The aim of a non-response survey is to<lb/> identify systematic biases about the groups of non-respondents. Therefore non-respondents should not be<lb/> replaced in the sample by other doctorate holders from the survey population. If the results from the non-<lb/>response analysis indicate that there is a difference between respondents and non-respondents indicators,<lb/> this information should be used when calculating the weighting factors.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.3<lb/> Imputation<lb/></head>

			<p>Item non-response should be kept at a minimum. Imputation should be the last option after every<lb/> attempt is made to get the needed information from other data sources i.e. census data, administrative or<lb/> register data or from the respondent.<lb/></p>

			<p>Item non-response imputations are recommended. Imputed values need to be flagged as for the non-<lb/>response analysis. The imputation methods to be used for handling missing values should be specified in<lb/> the national methodology description.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.4<lb/> Weighting and calibration<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to produce estimates for the surveyed population as a total, the data collected from a sample<lb/> survey have to be weighted. Even if the survey is a census survey, with total enumeration of the frame<lb/> population, weighting is appropriate to compensate for non-response or over-coverage.<lb/></p>

			<p>The simplest weighting technique is to use the inverse of the sampling fractions of the sampling units,<lb/> the inclusion probability, corrected for non-response. If a stratified sampling technique with different<lb/> sampling fractions is used, weights have to be calculated individually for each stratum. If appropriate<lb/> auxiliary information is available, it is recommended that estimates are built on models or calibration for<lb/> better precision and reduced bias.<lb/> If a non-response analysis is carried out (and the results indicate that there is a difference between<lb/> respondents and non-respondents), then the results of the non-response analysis should also be used when<lb/> calculating the final weighting factors. One approach is to divide each stratum into a number of response<lb/> homogeneous groups with (assumed) equal response probabilities within groups. A second approach could<lb/> be to use auxiliary information at the estimation stage for reducing the non-response bias.<lb/></p>

			<p>The methods that were mostly used in the previous CDH data collections were the Horvitz-Thompson<lb/> estimator, the Huang Fuller method and the method of propensity score weighting.<lb/> For the calculation of weights, there are various software packages that can be used, based on SAS<lb/> macro commands. These include the following:<lb/> • CLAN. This was developed by Statistics Sweden and is a suite of SAS-macro commands.<lb/> • CALMAR (Calibration on Margins). This is another SAS macro developed by INSEE in France.<lb/> • CALJACK. This is also a SAS macro developed by Statistics Canada.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.5<lb/> Over-coverage<lb/></head>

			<p>The extent of over-coverage could be difficult to estimate, but if over-coverage can be identified<lb/> among respondents, this could have implications. If a non-negligible amount of over-coverage is present in<lb/> the surveyed sample, the estimation weights have to be adjusted in order to reduce bias in the estimates.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.6<lb/> Under-coverage<lb/></head>

			<p>With the aid of suitable auxiliary information and calibration techniques, adequate estimators are<lb/> obtained even when under-coverage is present in a survey. As it is difficult to recommend which auxiliary<lb/> information to use, surveying countries will have to find their own auxiliary information to use. Another<lb/> approach less advanced but maybe more practical, could be to not try to correct for under-coverage in the<lb/> estimates, but discussing its occurrence and implication in the national methodology description.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Numerical estimation of the not covered proportion of the target population and of its magnitude in the<lb/> survey figures would very much facilitate the analysis of the results and comparison with data from other<lb/> countries.<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> 7.<lb/> DATA TRANSMISSION<lb/></figure>

			<head>7.1<lb/> Data to be transmitted<lb/></head>

			<p>The aggregated (tabulated) statistics to be delivered to the OECD and the UNESCO Institute for<lb/> Statistics are determined in close co-operation with the expert group on careers of doctorate holders. All<lb/> variables and their breakdowns in the output tables are to be compiled at national level, following the<lb/> definitions provided.<lb/> For those countries which are undergoing a transitional phase to the full implementation of the CDH<lb/> methodological guidelines, the reporting of the aggregated CDH statistics for only part of the CDH target<lb/> population will be accepted. However, this has to be explicitly stated in the accompanying national<lb/> metadata.<lb/></p>

			<p>Aggregated statistics have to be treated in accordance with the standard confidentiality rules at<lb/> national level, before transmission to the international organisations. National authorities are requested to<lb/> submit a file excluding confidential data, which indicates the cells suppressed for reasons of confidentiality<lb/> protection.<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries are also requested not to change the Excel template of the output tables requested<lb/> (i.e. standard names used, breakdowns, etc.) or the consistency checks inserted in the form of conditional<lb/> formatting. Changing the template entails extra burden for data compilation, increases the risk of errors and<lb/> complicates comparison between countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries wishing to send revised data should submit a revised complete file instead of delivering<lb/> only the revised figures.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to the tabulated aggregated statistics, national metadata are requested by the international<lb/> organisations. These metadata should cover type of sources used, types and degree of under-coverage of<lb/> the target population, national deviations from definitions or other key quality indicators such as non-<lb/>response rates, coefficient of variation, etc. A specific structure to be used in the metadata compilation will<lb/> be distributed together with the indicator templates and will also be made available at the CIRCA site of<lb/> Eurostat and the OECD CDH electronic discussion group.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.2<lb/> Transmission tools<lb/></head>

			<p>The CDH statistics are to be transmitted within an Excel file provided by the international<lb/> organisations to the countries concerned.<lb/> UIS, OECD and Eurostat determine a common delivery format scheme, including the name of Excel<lb/> sheets, name of the submitted files, numbering of revisions, etc. to which countries should fully comply.<lb/></p>

			<p>The special metadata structure for CDH statistics should be used when reporting on survey<lb/> methodology and data quality issues to the international organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.3<lb/> Deadlines<lb/></head>

			<p>Countries are asked to return the CDH output tables 12 months after the end of the reference year at<lb/> the latest.<lb/></p>

			<head>In addition:<lb/></head>

			<p>For more detailed information on the methodology of CDH statistics, please also consult the CIRCA<lb/> site of Eurostat and the OECDCDH electronic discussion group, where useful background documents will<lb/> be loaded on a regular basis.<lb/></p>

			<p>This questionnaire consists of six modules which concern the education of those with advanced research<lb/> qualifications (module EDU), their early career research positions (module ECR), employment history<lb/> (module EMP), international mobility (module MOB), career-related experience (module CAR) and<lb/> personal characteristics (module PER). The present document proposes the following sequence for the<lb/> modules: EDU-ECR-EMP-MOB-CAR-PER. However, countries are encouraged to organise the<lb/> questionnaire according to their own needs and national policy priorities. Countries are also encouraged to<lb/> share their national questionnaires with the other participating countries and the three international<lb/> organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Remarks applicable to all modules<lb/></head>

			<p>Questions marked with ( * ) are essential to cover information for filling out the CDH output tables. When<lb/> organising your national questionnaire, please make sure that ALL these questions are included. You are<lb/> free to incorporate extra questions in order to reflect your national requirements.<lb/></p>

			<table>ONLY QUESTIONS MARKED WITH * ARE REQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL<lb/> SURVEY. ALL OTHER QUESTIONS ARE OPTIONAL AND DERIVE FROM PREVIOUS USAGE IN<lb/> NATIONAL SURVEYS.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Countries are therefore encouraged to give the mandatory questions priority, and to include only<lb/> those optional questions for which there is a clear policy request.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Please pay particular attention to adapting ALL filter questions (accompanied by SKIP or GO TO) with the<lb/> actual order of modules chosen, even if the proposed order is adopted. &lt;NEXT MODULE&gt; should be<lb/> substituted by the denomination of the next module in your national questionnaire design.<lb/></p>

			<p>Many questions require respondents to refer to a table provided in the instruction manual to identify the<lb/> corresponding classification code. As there are several tables of classification codes provided in the<lb/> manual, it is possible that respondents could use the wrong table and enter the wrong code in their survey.<lb/> The accuracy and ease with which these questions are completed may be improved by including the<lb/> relevant classification table within the questionnaire itself, particularly if the questionnaires will be<lb/> administered electronically. If this is not possible, the table should be referred to by its exact and complete<lb/> title given in the Instruction Manual provided to the respondents (e.g. Classification 1: Fields of Science<lb/> and Technology). These questions could also ask for plain text instead of codes. Countries are free to<lb/> adapt these in both ways.<lb/></p>

			<p>Please note that ALL elements in brackets &lt;&gt; should be replaced accordingly.<lb/> In &lt;201X&gt;, &lt;201X-1&gt;, &lt;201X-2&gt;, &lt;201X-9&gt;, 201X should be substituted by the year of the survey, 201X-1<lb/> with the previous year, and so on.<lb/> &lt;The country X&gt; should be replaced by the name of your country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Section &quot; SCOPE AND PURPOSE &quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>This section should be complemented with some information on the particular objectives of the survey in<lb/> the country.<lb/></p>

			<p>The phrase &lt;Your response is voluntary and failure to provide some or all of the requested information will<lb/> not in any way adversely affect you.&gt; should only be included in those countries were response is<lb/> voluntary. A note stating the mandatory character of the survey should be included instead, if appropriate.<lb/> &lt;20 minutes&gt; is the estimated time to complete the questionnaire if no other questions are added.<lb/> However, countries are encouraged to estimate the time needed in each case, and give the right value in<lb/> this section.<lb/></p>

			<figure>DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> Module EDU<lb/> Question EDU.1 could be adapted to the national context. The state or province could be removed if<lb/> considered not relevant.<lb/> In question EDU.4 &lt;advanced research qualification work/thesis/dissertation&gt; should be adapted to the<lb/> national context according to the national education system in your country. The items given in this<lb/> question could also be adapted to the national context if considered unclear in its current version.<lb/> In question EDU.5 &lt;Industrial interface/working with industry&gt; should be replaced by the type of relations<lb/> between academia and industry prevalent in your country.<lb/> Items in question EDU.11 should be adapted to the institutional structures funding advanced research<lb/> qualification studies in the country, while ensuring correspondence with the classification presented, also<lb/> used in the output tabulations ED5, EMP3 and EMP7. The following classification is more detailed than the<lb/> one proposed and could also be applied if appropriate:<lb/></figure>

			<table>A.<lb/> 1.<lb/> Fellowship, scholarship from your institution<lb/> 2.<lb/> Fellowship, scholarship from government<lb/> 3.<lb/> Fellowship, scholarship from business<lb/> 4.<lb/> Fellowship, scholarship from a private non-profit organisation (PNP)<lb/> B.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Fellowship, scholarship from abroad<lb/> C.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Teaching assistantship<lb/> 7.<lb/> Research assistantship<lb/> 8.<lb/> Teaching and research assistantship<lb/> D.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Other occupation (full time)<lb/> 10.<lb/> Other occupation (part time)<lb/> E.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Employer reimbursement / assistance<lb/> F.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Loan<lb/> 13.<lb/> Personal savings<lb/> 14.<lb/> Spouse&apos;s, partner&apos;s or family support<lb/> 15.<lb/> Spouse&apos;s, partner&apos;s or family support from abroad<lb/> G.<lb/> 16.<lb/> Other<lb/> H.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Unknown<lb/></table>

			<head>Module ECR<lb/></head>

			<p>The purpose of this module is to gather data on the particular working conditions of those who are on<lb/> temporary or short-term contracts, often called &apos;post-doctorates&apos; which are typically held shortly after<lb/> completing an advanced research qualification, but before holding a regular full time career path job.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Module EMP<lb/> In question EMP.2 &lt;gross annual earnings&gt; should be replaced by the term relevant to your country.<lb/> Questions EMP.3 and EMP.10 could be adapted to the national context. The name of the employer, and<lb/> the state or province could be removed if considered not relevant. In these questions, &quot; Occupation &quot; could<lb/> alternatively be replaced by the following.<lb/> Using the OCCUPATIONS LIST (see Manual: Classification 2: Occupations ISCO-08), choose the code that BEST describes the<lb/> work at this position.<lb/> CODE<lb/> If this option was chosen, the Manual should include &quot; Classification 2: ISCO-08 Occupations &quot; as below.<lb/></figure>

			<p>With the current version, coding of ISCO occupations will have to be carried out by the national project<lb/> team. In case ISCO-08 is not in yet place in the country, a correspondence table could be used from ISCO-<lb/>88 to ISCO-08, such as for example the one available on the ILO site.<lb/></p>

			<head>Questions EMP.4 and EMP.5 should</head>

			<p>be adapted to the national context according to the national<lb/> education system in your country.<lb/> Question EMP.10 asks about the most recent previous position only. If a country wants to ask for more, or<lb/> all, previous positions in the last 10 years, this has to be added to the questionnaire.<lb/></p>

			<head>Module CAR<lb/></head>

			<p>In question CAR.4 &lt;three years&gt; should be replaced by the number of years suitable for your national<lb/> needs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Module PER<lb/></head>

			<p>Question PER.2: If the full date is asked in the national questionnaire, instead of only the year, the<lb/> response box should be adapted according to the standard national date format.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Question PER.3 could be adapted to the national context. The state or province could be removed if<lb/> considered not relevant.<lb/> Questions PER.4 and PER.6 could be adapted to national standards, since categories may vary.<lb/> &lt;marriage-like relationship&gt; should be replaced by the expression commonly used in the national context.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Instruction Manual<lb/></head>

			<p>The Instruction Manual also bears some sections that need to be adapted to national survey context. For<lb/> example, &lt;Introduction of institution carrying out the survey&gt; is a place keeper for some information on the<lb/> national institution carrying out the CDH survey.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For any queries relating to the adaptation of this questionnaire, do not hesitate to contact the UNESCO<lb/> Institute for Statistics by e-mail: uis.stsurvey@unesco.org or by fax: +1 -514 343 6872.<lb/> SCOPE AND PURPOSE<lb/> The international Survey on Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH) is a joint project carried out by the<lb/> UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development<lb/> (OECD) and the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The present questionnaire is designed to collect the most recent statistics on educational history, work<lb/> experience and international mobility of holders of advanced research qualifications. The main objectives<lb/> of the questionnaire are:<lb/></p>

			<p>• To collect internationally comparable statistics on the careers of holders of advanced research<lb/> qualifications.<lb/> • To establish and analyse trends in the career paths and mobility of highly qualified people throughout<lb/> the world.<lb/> The improvement and harmonisation of data collection in a broad number of countries and its further<lb/> analysis should enable policy makers, researchers and analysts to start the appropriate policies with<lb/> regard to highly qualified people in order to ensure their career developments all over the world.<lb/> Any information publicly released (such as statistical summaries) will be in a form that does not personally<lb/> identify you.<lb/> &lt;Your response is voluntary and failure to provide some or all of the requested information will not in any<lb/> way adversely affect you.&gt;<lb/> Actual time to complete the questionnaire may vary depending on your circumstances. On average, it will<lb/> take about &lt;20 minutes&gt; to complete the questionnaire.<lb/></p>

			<p>Your assistance is essential to ensure that the results are meaningful. Your answers will be kept strictly<lb/> confidential and used for statistical purposes only.<lb/></p>

			<figure>DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/> Thank you for taking the time to complete this questionnaire.<lb/> Directions for filling it out are provided in the accompanying<lb/> manual. Because not all questions will apply to everyone, you may<lb/> be asked to skip certain questions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Please use an &quot; X &quot; when answering questions that require<lb/> marking a box.<lb/> • In order to get comparable data, we will be asking you to refer to<lb/> 1 December &lt;201X&gt;.<lb/> • Follow all &quot; SKIP &quot; and &quot; GO TO &quot; instructions after marking a box.<lb/> &lt;The following two bullets should be removed if an electronic<lb/> questionnaire is used&gt;<lb/> • Either a pen or pencil may be used.<lb/> • If you need to change an answer, please make sure that your old<lb/> answer is either completely erased or clearly crossed out.<lb/></p>

			<head>INTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................................................ 66<lb/> INTRODUCTION<lb/> Introduction of institution carrying out the survey<lb/></head>

			<p>The international Survey on Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH) is a joint project carried out by the<lb/> the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UNESCO Institute for<lb/> Statistics (UIS) and the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat). The project focuses on<lb/> holders of advanced research qualifications (usually doctorate holders) who are considered to be crucial to<lb/> the production, application and diffusion of knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<p>The present questionnaire is designed to collect the most recent statistics on educational history, work<lb/> experience and international mobility of holders of advanced research qualifications throughout the world.<lb/> The main objectives of the questionnaire are:<lb/> • To build internationally comparable indicators on the careers of holders of advanced research<lb/> qualifications.<lb/> • To identify and analyse trends in the career paths and mobility of highly qualified people<lb/> throughout the world.<lb/> The improvement and harmonisation of data collection in a broad number of countries and its further<lb/> analysis should enable policy makers, researchers and analysts to conduct the appropriate policies with<lb/> regard to highly qualified people in order to ensure their career development all over the world.<lb/> This instruction manual has been prepared in order to help respondents completing the questionnaire.<lb/> It comprises the definitions and other guidelines that should be followed in order to facilitate international<lb/> comparison of the statistics provided by different countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The definitions and classification presented in this manual are based on different internationally<lb/> recognised sources such as the</p>

			<table>Frascati Manual (OECD), International Labour Organization (ILO)<lb/> Resolutions Concerning Economically Active Population, Employment, Unemployment and<lb/> Underemployment Adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 1982),<lb/> National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients, International Standard Classification of<lb/> Education (ISCED-1997), International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) and others (see<lb/> sources related to the presented definitions).<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2012)7<lb/></table>

			<head>1.<lb/> COVERAGE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE<lb/></head>

			<p>The questionnaire is designed to collect data on all individuals who on the reference date fulfil the<lb/> following criteria:<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Have an education at ISCED 6 level 5 (see definition 1) obtained anywhere in the world; and<lb/> • Are resident (permanent or non-permanent) within the national borders of the surveying country.<lb/> Definition 1: ISCED 6 : Advanced research qualification<lb/> ISCED LEVEL 6: SECOND STAGE OF TERTIARY EDUCATION (LEADING TO AN ADVANCED RESEARCH<lb/> QUALIFICATION)<lb/></figure>

			<head>Principal characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>This level is reserved for tertiary programmes which lead to the award of an advanced research qualification. The<lb/> programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only.<lb/></p>

			<head>Classification criteria<lb/></head>

			<p>For the definition of this level, the following criteria are relevant:<lb/></p>

			<head>Main criterion<lb/></head>

			<p>It typically requires the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality which is the product of<lb/> original research and represents a significant contribution to knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<head>Subsidiary criterion<lb/></head>

			<p>It prepares graduates for faculty posts in institutions offering ISCED 5A programmes, as well as research<lb/> posts in government, industry, etc.<lb/></p>

			<head>Includes also:<lb/></head>

			<p>The part concentrating on advanced research in those countries where students beginning tertiary education<lb/> enrol directly for an advanced research programme.<lb/></p>

			<figure>5.<lb/> ISCED was revised in 2011, but its implementation is not expected before 2014. Therefore this<lb/> questionnaire still uses ISCED 1997. The equivalent of ISCED 1997 level 6 will be ISCED 2011 level 8.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.<lb/> INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE<lb/></head>

			<figure>Not all questions will apply to everyone. You may be asked to skip certain questions.<lb/> • Please use an &quot; X &quot; when answering questions that require marking a box.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• In order to obtain comparable data, we will be asking you to refer to your situation on 1 December &lt;201X&gt;.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Follow all &quot; SKIP &quot; and &quot; GO TO &quot; instructions after marking a box.<lb/> &lt;The following two bullets should be removed if an electronic questionnaire is used&gt;<lb/> • Either a pen or pencil may be used.<lb/></p>

			<figure>• If you need to change an answer, please make sure that your old answer is either completely erased or<lb/> clearly crossed out.<lb/> The present questionnaire has been drafted in accordance with the definitions and methodological<lb/> guidelines prepared in the framework of the CDH project in order to facilitate international comparison of<lb/> the statistics provided by different countries. Please refer to the definitions in this Manual for further<lb/> clarification.<lb/> The questionnaire consists of the following modules:<lb/> • EDU – Advanced research qualification education<lb/> • ECR – Early career research positions<lb/> • EMP – Employment situation<lb/> • MOB – International mobility<lb/> • CAR – Career-related experience<lb/> • PER – Personal characteristics<lb/></figure>

			<p>Your assistance is essential to ensure that the results are meaningful. Your answers will be kept<lb/> strictly confidential and used for statistical purposes only. Any information publicly released (such as<lb/> statistical summaries) will be in form that does not personally identify you.<lb/> &lt;Your response is voluntary and failure to provide some or all of the requested information will not in<lb/> any way adversely affect you.&gt;<lb/></p>

			<figure>Actual time to complete the questionnaire may vary depending on your circumstances. On<lb/> average, it will take about 20 minutes to complete the questionnaire.<lb/> Answering question EDU.9, which requires</figure>

			<p>that you supply an estimate of the number of months it<lb/> took you to complete your advanced research qualification during the period between when you started<lb/> your advanced research qualification programme and when your advanced research qualification degree<lb/> was granted, please subtract periods longer than one week taken off for reasons such as irrelevant<lb/> temporary jobs to sustain funding throughout the advanced research qualification programme, or for<lb/> personal, family or maternity/paternity leave reasons. However, time spent on study or work abroad<lb/> relevant to your advanced research qualification programme should not be counted as &quot; taken off &quot; . When<lb/> answering this question, please make sure that you round the indicated number of months to whole months.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Answering question EDU.10, which requires that you supply the country in which you received your<lb/> previous university degree (at ISCED 7 level), please take into account definition 2.<lb/> Definition 2: ISCED 1997 level 5: First stage of tertiary education (not leading directly to an advanced research<lb/> qualification)<lb/></figure>

			<p>ISCED 5 is composed of two different types of tertiary programmes, not leading directly to the award of an<lb/> advanced research qualification (such as doctorates, which are at ISCED level 6):<lb/></p>

			<p>ISCED 5A programmes are tertiary programmes that are largely theoretically based and are intended to provide<lb/> sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into advanced research programmes and professions with high skills<lb/> requirements. They must satisfy a sufficient number of the following criteria:<lb/> •<lb/> A minimum cumulative theoretical duration (at tertiary level) of three years&apos; full-time equivalent, although<lb/> typically they are of four or more years.<lb/> •<lb/> Faculty with advanced research credentials.<lb/> •<lb/> May involve completion of a research project or thesis.<lb/> •<lb/> Provide the level of education required for entry into a profession with high skills requirements<lb/> (theoretically based/research preparatory, such as history, philosophy, mathematics, etc., or giving<lb/> access to professions with high skills requirements, e.g. medicine, dentistry, architecture, etc.) or an<lb/> advanced research programme.<lb/> This level typically includes programmes such as &quot; Bachelors &quot; , as well as all the research programmes which are<lb/> not part of a doctorate, such as any type of Master&apos;s degrees.<lb/></p>

			<head>ISCED</head>

			<p>5B programmes are tertiary programmes typically shorter than those in 5A and focus on occupationally<lb/> specific skills geared for entry into the labour market, although some theoretical foundations may be covered in the<lb/> respective programme. The content of ISCED level 5B programmes is practically oriented/occupationally specific and<lb/> is mainly designed for participants to acquire the practical skills and know-how needed for employment in a particular<lb/> occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades -the successful completion of which usually provides the<lb/> participants with a labour-market relevant qualification.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: UNESCO International Standard Classification of Education 1997 (ISCED-1997).<lb/> MODULE ECR – EARLY CAREER RESEARCH POSITIONS<lb/> If you were in permanent employment, self-employed, unemployed or inactive on 1 December<lb/> &lt;201X&gt;, please skip this module.<lb/> This module addresses persons who were in a temporary research position on 1 December &lt;201X&gt;<lb/> that satisfies most or all of the conditions in question ECR.2. Often, this type of position is referred to as a<lb/> postdoc position. It is generally understood that a postdoc is a temporary position for holders of advanced<lb/> research qualifications (i.e. after finalising their advanced research qualification studies) where the main<lb/> activity is research, and the holder receives some kind of financial support.

			<p>• All firms, organisations and institutions whose primary activity is the market production of goods or services<lb/> (other than higher education) for sale to the general public at an economically significant price.<lb/> • The private non-profit institutions mainly serving them.<lb/></p>

			<head>The government sector includes:<lb/></head>

			<p>• All departments, offices and other bodies which furnish, but normally do not sell to the community, those<lb/> common services, other than higher education, which cannot otherwise be conveniently and economically<lb/> provided, as well as those that administer the state and the economic and social policy of the community.<lb/> (Public enterprises mainly engaged in market production and sale of goods and services are included in the<lb/> business enterprise sector.)<lb/></p>

			<p>• Non-profit institutions controlled and mainly financed by government, not administered by the higher<lb/> education sector.<lb/> The higher education sector is composed of:<lb/></p>

			<p>• All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions providing tertiary education, whatever their<lb/> source of finance or legal status.<lb/></p>

			<p>• It also includes all research institutes, experimental stations and clinics under the direct control of or<lb/> administered by or associated with higher education institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The other education sector is composed of all institutions providing pre-primary, primary or secondary<lb/> education, whatever their source of finance or legal status.<lb/></p>

			<head>The private non-profit sector includes:<lb/></head>

			<p>• Non-market, private non-profit institutions serving households (i.e. the general public).<lb/></p>

			<head>• Private individuals or households.<lb/></head>

			<p>The market activities of unincorporated enterprises owned by households, i.e. consultants undertaking projects<lb/> for another unit at an economically significant price, should be included in the business enterprise sector in line with<lb/> National Accounts conventions (unless the project is undertaken using staff and facilities in another sector, see below).<lb/> Hence, the PNP sector should only include activities undertaken by non-market, unincorporated enterprises owned by<lb/> households, i.e. individuals financed by their own resources or by &quot; uneconomic &quot; grants.<lb/> Furthermore, where grants and contracts are formally awarded to individuals who are primarily employed in<lb/> another sector, such as grants made directly to a university professor, unless such persons undertake the activity<lb/> concerned entirely on their own time and make no use of their employing unit&apos;s staff and facilities, they should be<lb/> included in the statistics of the employing unit. It therefore follows that this sector only includes activities performed by<lb/> individuals exclusively on their own time and with their own facilities and at their own expense or supported by an<lb/> uneconomic grant.<lb/></p>

			<head>The government sector includes:<lb/></head>

			<p>All departments, offices and other bodies which furnish, but<lb/> normally do not sell to the community, those common services,<lb/> other than higher education, which cannot otherwise be<lb/> conveniently and economically provided, as well as those that<lb/> administer the state and the economic and social policy of the<lb/> community. (Public enterprises mainly engaged in market<lb/> production and sale of goods and services are included in the<lb/> business enterprise sector.)<lb/> Non-profit institutions controlled and mainly financed by<lb/> government, not administered by the higher education sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>The higher education sector is composed of:<lb/> All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions<lb/> providing tertiary education, whatever their source of finance or<lb/> legal status.<lb/></p>

			<p>It also includes all research institutes, experimental stations and<lb/> clinics under the direct control of or administered by or associated<lb/> with higher education institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>The other education sector</head>

			<p>is composed of all institutions<lb/> providing pre-primary, primary or secondary education, whatever<lb/> their source of finance or legal status.<lb/></p>

			<p>The market activities of unincorporated enterprises owned by<lb/> households, i.e. consultants undertaking projects for another unit<lb/> at an economically significant price, should be included in the<lb/> business enterprise sector in line with National Accounts<lb/> conventions (unless the project is undertaken using staff and<lb/> facilities in another sector, see below). Hence, the PNP sector<lb/> should only include activities undertaken by non-market,<lb/> unincorporated enterprises owned by households, i.e. individuals<lb/> financed by their own resources or by &quot; uneconomic &quot; grants.<lb/> Furthermore, where grants and contracts are formally awarded to<lb/> individuals who are primarily employed in another sector, such as<lb/> grants made directly to a university professor, unless such<lb/> persons undertake the activity concerned entirely on their own<lb/> time and make no use of their employing unit&apos;s staff and facilities,<lb/> they should be included in the statistics of the employing unit. It<lb/> therefore follows that this sector only includes activities performed<lb/> by individuals exclusively on their own time and with their own<lb/> facilities and at their own expense or supported by an uneconomic<lb/> grant.<lb/></p>
