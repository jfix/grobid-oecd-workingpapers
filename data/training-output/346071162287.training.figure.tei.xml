            <figDesc>Ce document décrit et évalue les politiques de prix et de remboursement des médicaments au Canada,<lb/> en les situant dans le contexte politique et l&apos;environnement de marché dans lesquels elles s&apos;inscrivent ; et<lb/> en observant leur rôle dans l&apos;atteinte des objectifs relatifs à la politique pharmaceutique canadienne. Le<lb/> gouvernement fédéral régule les prix des médicaments brevetés dans le but de protéger les consommateurs<lb/> de prix excessifs. Cette régulation a très probablement eu pour effet d&apos;amener les prix des médicaments<lb/> brevetés canadiens au niveau des prix des pays européens auxquels le Canada se compare. Les prix des<lb/> médicaments génériques, qui ne sont pas régulés, sont relativement élevés malgré une forte pénétration des<lb/> génériques sur les marchés. Tous les Canadiens sont couverts pour les médicaments fournis à l&apos;hôpital par<lb/> un système public qui fournit gratuitement tous les services hospitaliers et médicaux. Les médicaments<lb/> dispensés dans le secteur ambulatoire ne sont pas inclus dans le panier des services couverts au titre de la<lb/> Loi Canadienne sur la santé. Par conséquent, deux tiers des Canadiens, dont la plupart des salariés et leurs<lb/> familles, obtiennent une couverture médicament par les assurances privées, tandis que beaucoup de<lb/> personnes âgées, ainsi que certains groupes vulnérables de la population, sont couverts par des plans<lb/> publics provinciaux, territoriaux ou fédéraux. Dans la plupart des cas, les patients participent aux dépenses<lb/> de médicaments remboursables selon diverses modalités (forfait, co-assurance), parfois assorties de<lb/> franchises. Le manque de protection contre le risque de dépenses catastrophiques de médicament reste un<lb/> problème pour une petite partie de la population canadienne, concentrée dans les provinces atlantiques.<lb/> Reflétant l&apos;ensemble de ces modalités de couverture et de remboursement, 54% des dépenses de<lb/> médicaments sont financées par les assurances privées et les ménages. Les dépenses de médicaments ont<lb/> augmenté rapidement au cours des dernières années. Le management des listes de médicaments<lb/> remboursables, à présent facilité par une initiative gouvernementale pour entreprendre une évaluation<lb/> centralisée des médicaments, et la promotion de la substitution par les génériques, ont été les principaux<lb/> leviers utilisés par les plans publics pour améliorer l&apos;efficience des dépenses de médicament. Les plans<lb/> privés couvraient, par le passé, tous les médicaments autorisés à la vente au Canada, mais ceci est en train<lb/> de changer sous la pression des coûts. Dans l&apos;ensemble, les nouveaux médicaments sont disponibles sur le<lb/> marché Canadien dans des délais satisfaisants mais le maintien de bonnes conditions de disponibilité et<lb/> d&apos;accessibilité financière pourrait devenir un défi.<lb/> Codes JEL : I18, I11<lb/> Mots-clés : Politique du médicament ; prix et remboursement ; marché pharmaceutique ; Canada TABLE OF CONTENTS<lb/> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Formulary listing processes used in selected drug coverage schemes<lb/> Ontario<lb/> 1<lb/> The Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) covers all drugs listed in a general formulary, although coverage may be restricted to<lb/> some indications ( &quot; Limited Use &quot; ). Beyond this formulary, two specific programs exist: the Special Drug Program covers<lb/> very expensive medicines, such as treatments of HIV, cystic fibrosis, growth failure, etc., and the Section 8 Program<lb/> furnishes coverage for drugs which are approved for sale in Canada but which are not (yet) on the ODB formulary or<lb/> which are prescribed out of the &apos;Limited Use&apos; conditions required for reimbursement. This is reserved for exceptional<lb/> circumstances and needs a request by the physician. The Ontario formulary contains 3,300 products and other drugs<lb/> listed for limited use.<lb/> Formulary decisions are made by the Minister of Health, with the advice of the Drug Quality and Therapeutics<lb/> Committee (DQTC) of Ontario. DQTC members are appointed by the Government of Ontario. In 2006, there were 12<lb/> members: 9 physicians, 2 pharmacists and 1 economist. The DQTC meets once a month to examine reviews prepared<lb/> by experts. Its deliberations are confidential, as are manufacturers&apos; applications. The Ontario Ministry of Health<lb/> decided in the early 1990s that formulary decisions should be enhanced by cost-effectiveness analysis. Ontario&apos;s first<lb/> pharmaco-economic guidelines were drafted in 1993 and companies seeking reimbursement of their products have<lb/> been required to undertake cost-effectiveness studies since 1996.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Reforms introduced in 2002 (though yet to become law) added two new criteria to better take into account<lb/> societal values: (3) prospective impact on population health and on other aspects of the health care system, and (4)<lb/> appropriateness of listing in relation to the objectives of the general drug coverage scheme, which is to ensure<lb/> reasonable and equitable access to drugs. Recommendations of the Council are published when the decision of the<lb/> MSSS is announced. In 2004-2005, 100% of the recommendations issued by the Council were followed by the Québec<lb/> government. Recommendations were negative in 32% of cases in 2004-2005 and in 19% of cases in 2005-2006<lb/> (Conseil du médicament, 2005 and 2006).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>number of drugs listed to the number of listing applications by manufacturers.<lb/> Québec is more inclined to include new drugs in its formulary (48% of applications in 2003) than other<lb/> provinces, followed by Manitoba and Saskatchewan (39% and 38%). Other provinces are more stringent.<lb/> The propensity to list new drugs declined in all provinces between 2000 and 2003.<lb/> 65.<lb/> &quot; Time to listing &quot; measures the time from the date of approval for marketing to the date of<lb/> formulary listing in each province. It cannot be interpreted as an indicator of efficiency of listing<lb/> procedures since it includes delays in application submissions by manufacturers. The average time to<lb/> listing varied from less than one year in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador to more than two<lb/> years in the Northwest Territories. The time to listing increased in many provinces between 2000 and<lb/> 2003. Since then, the Common Drug Review has been implemented and may have reduced the variation in<lb/> time to listing for new chemical entities since manufacturers file a unique application for all public plans.<lb/> 24<lb/> The authors observed the status in 10 provinces of 58 products approved for sale in Canada in 1996-1997.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>For<lb/> instance, intravenous cancer drugs are not reviewed by the CDR and their coverage varies across provinces<lb/> and territories. The Cancer Advocacy Coalition of Canada (2005) assessed the coverage status of 20 cancer<lb/> drugs in provinces and states that there &quot; is variable access to new drugs across the provinces, depending on<lb/> a jurisdiction&apos;s prioritisation of the treatment, timeliness of the often multi-tier vetting process, and<lb/> availability of resources to support each new treatment. This results in treatments being available in some<lb/> provinces but not others at any point in time &quot; (p. 27). 25 The report indicates that British Columbia &quot; has the<lb/> best funded and most timely access to cancer drugs, &quot; attributed to a consistent cancer programme<lb/> coordinated by a provincial cancer agency.<lb/> 67.<lb/> In 2005, McMahon et al. (2006) compared recommendations issued by the Common Drug<lb/> Review for 25 products between April 2004 and June 2005 to decisions made in 10 provinces and 3<lb/> territories in June 2005. At the time of the survey, all the drugs were still under review in Prince Edward<lb/> Island, as was the case for 16 to 19 drugs in Manitoba, New Brunswick and the Yukon territories. Other<lb/> provinces had made more decisions. British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Ontario<lb/> showed the highest concordance between formulary decisions and CDR recommendations.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>and Territorial Taskforce on Pharmaceutical Prices (published in 1999 and quoted by University<lb/> of Calgary, 2004), Saskatchewan&apos;s generic drug prices jumped by around 10% at the time of the<lb/> introduction of Québec&apos;s lowest price policy.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Since 1998, Ontario has required that the price of the first generic listed on the formulary not<lb/> exceed 70% of the brand-name product price and that prices of subsequent generic entrants not exceed<lb/> 90% of the price of the first generic product. As of October 2006, generics will have to be priced 50%<lb/> lower than the comparator product to be listed in the Ontario drug benefit formulary. Alberta also limits the<lb/> price of generic entrants to 75% of the brand-name price. As a consequence of its own regulation requiring<lb/> the &quot; best available price &quot; , Québec benefits from the regulation adopted in Ontario. In a policy paper issued<lb/> by the Québec Ministry of Health in December 2004, the government proposed to further regulate the price<lb/> of generics by limiting the price of the first entrant to 60% of the originator&apos;s brand-name price and the<lb/> price of following entrants to 54% of that price.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>). As seen before, this policy<lb/> created some tension with other provincial policies. In reaction, generic manufacturers have created<lb/> affiliates to serve Saskatchewan so as to avoid demands to receive the same price elsewhere. No complete<lb/> assessment of this policy was found, but the PMPRB mentions that a sharp decrease in generic prices in<lb/> 1999-2001 seems to have been compensated by exceptional growth between 2001 and 2004 (PMPRB,<lb/> 2006b, p. 30).<lb/> 84.<lb/> Reimbursement price freezes have been used in at least two provinces. Since 1994, Ontario has<lb/> frozen the retail price it will pay for drugs listed on its formulary. 29 In Québec, prices of drugs included in<lb/> the positive list are not allowed to increase, except in exceptional circumstances (such as an increase in the<lb/> cost of an input).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In 2000, about 29% of private plans did not require any co-payment<lb/> (Fraser/Tristat, 2002). Out-of-pocket payments are regularly capped at $2,000 per year. 30 Enrolees may<lb/> have to pay pharmacists&apos; fees.<lb/> 88.<lb/> Co-payment is the most common form of patient cost-sharing in public drug plans (see Box 5).<lb/> Total out-of-pocket spending amounts are sometimes capped.

            <figDesc>The report also used simulations to analyse patients&apos; co-payments, according to three indicators:<lb/> the coverage for routine expenses (share of the first CAN$1,000 of annual drug expense covered by the<lb/> drug plan), the coverage for catastrophic expenses (proportion of the &quot; last CAN$1,000 &quot; covered by the<lb/> drug plan for an annual expense of CAN$50,000), and the share of family income which would be<lb/> absorbed by out-of-pocket payments of CAN$1,000. It concluded that 90% of the Canadian population has<lb/> some coverage for routine expenditures and the remainder would pay every dollar if they had to face<lb/> expenditures up to CAN$1,000. People who are uninsured against routine expenditures are most often<lb/> under 65 years and working. It also concluded that full coverage of the last CAN$1000 of catastrophic expenditures would be provided to 93% of the Canadian population. Another 4% would be required to co-<lb/>pay 20% of these expenditures and another 3% (concentrated in the Atlantic Provinces and in Alberta)<lb/> have no coverage against such expenditures. Finally, people for whom out-of-pocket payments of<lb/> CAN$1,000 would represent more than 4.5% of family income accounted for 2% of the Canadian<lb/> population, concentrated in the same provinces and British Colombia (Applied Management, 2000).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The need for catastrophic coverage was limited when most of the public drug plans were<lb/> designed, but it is more important today, given the increase in drug costs per individual. This need has been<lb/> acknowledged recently in two prominent policy reports produced by the Romanow Commission and the<lb/> Kirby Committee (Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, 2002; Standing Senate Committee<lb/> on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, 2002).<lb/> 99.<lb/> The Romanow report advocated the integration of prescription drugs into the insured benefits<lb/> guaranteed by the Canada Health Act. It argued for a gradual integration in order not to threaten the<lb/> sustainability of the system and recommended first the introduction of a new federal financial transfer<lb/> aimed at high-expense individuals to help provinces and territories to better cover the costs of prescription<lb/> drug plans. It defined the threshold for catastrophic expenses as being $1,500 out-of-pocket per individual,<lb/> and proposed catastrophic coverage in the form of a federal contribution of 50% of costs per individual<lb/> exceeding $1,500.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In 1987, amendments to the Patent Act were introduced (Bill C-22) to enhance patent protection<lb/> of pharmaceuticals 39 . These amendments guaranteed an increase in protection against compulsory licensing<lb/> after market approval: 10 years against compulsory licensing to import and 7 years against compulsory<lb/> licensing to manufacture. They also introduced the ability to issue product patents to complete the<lb/> protection offered by process patents. As well, the patent protection period was extended to 20 years from<lb/> date of filing instead of the previous system granting 17 years from date of patent&apos;s issue.<lb/> 122.<lb/> In 1993, following negotiations related to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</figDesc>

These amendments were conceived in response to specific<lb/> concerns expressed by stakeholders following pre-publication of the proposed amendments in Part I of the<lb/> Canada Gazette on December 11, 2004.

In a policy paper issued in the<lb/> 1990s, Canadian authorities concluded that Canadian patients were able to benefit from new drugs<lb/> discovered in foreign countries and that there was no need to foster national innovation in this sector<lb/> (Health Canada report of 1997 quoted by the Canadian coalition for rare disorders, 2005). However,<lb/> BioteCanada (2004) 44 calls for the implementation of such a policy in order to take advantage of the good<lb/> development of the biotech industry in Canada to develop biotech orphan drugs.</figDesc>

In 1985, they were responsible for only 67.5% of total drug expenditures (CIHI,<lb/> 2006). Expenditures for non-prescribed drugs include both over-the-counter drugs (CAN$ 2.23 billion or<lb/> 9.0% of total drug expenditures in 2005) and personal health supplies such as dental floss and disposable<lb/> diabetic syringes (CAN$ 1.93 billion, 7.8% of drug expenditures).

            <figDesc>The number of prescriptions filled in Canadian retail pharmacies has increased significantly over<lb/> the past 10 years, from 228.2 million in 1995 to 395.8 million in 2005, according to IMS Health<lb/> calculations, an increase of 73%. Considered in per capita terms, this equates to an increase in the number<lb/> of prescriptions filled from an average of 7.8 to approximately 12 per year.<lb/> 146.<lb/> The number of annual prescriptions per person also varies widely across Canadian provinces,<lb/> from a low of 9 in British Columbia to a high of 20 in Québec in 2005 (IMS Health, 2006). Among the<lb/> factors explaining this variation are differences in the period of time for which a drug is normally<lb/> prescribed. Prescriptions in Québec are normally smaller in terms of the quantity of dosages than are those<lb/> of other provinces; therefore, a greater number of prescriptions are issued for the treatment of chronic<lb/> conditions or extended spells of illness. Differences in the age composition of the population, 53 as well as<lb/> differences in policies or practices that influence prescribing behaviour, may also explain some of the<lb/> variation.<lb/> 147.<lb/> Both in terms of the average number of prescriptions filled and the range of variation across<lb/> jurisdictions, Canada appears roughly similar to the United States, where the average number of<lb/> prescriptions per capita in 2004 was 10.6, with variation across states ranging from 6.5 (in Alaska) to 15.4<lb/> (in Kentucky) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2006).</figDesc>

(2005) compared the consumption of statins among elderly patients covered by<lb/> public drug plans in Nova Scotia and in Queensland, Australia between 1997 and 2001. Patterns of<lb/> consumption were found to be very similar. The use of statins increased sharply over the period in both<lb/> jurisdictions, from 50 DDDs/1,000 beneficiaries per day in 1997 to 205 in 2001, reflecting worldwide<lb/> evolutions in recommendations for the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and in statins use. Prescription<lb/> costs per 1,000 beneficiaries increased during the period although average unit costs per DDD actually<lb/> decreased in both countries (Prices in Nova Scotia have historically been higher than in Queensland<lb/> (CAN$ 1.14 per DDD versus CAN$ 0.88)).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>As a consequence of discrepancies in the scope of provincial and territorial drug plans, public<lb/> financing of prescribed drug expenditures varies widely across provinces, from 32% in New Brunswick to<lb/> 70% in the Northwest Territories (Table 2).<lb/> 165.<lb/> Households&apos; expenditures on drugs averaged $218 per family 56 in 2002, an increase of 71% (in<lb/> 2002 dollars) since 1992 (Luffman, 2005). Drug spending represented 25% of households&apos; expenditures on<lb/> health, of which 16% were out-of-pocket payments for partly subsidised drugs and 9% payments for other<lb/> drugs. Premiums paid by households for private health insurance represented another 34% of households&apos;<lb/> health expenditures. Again, the situation differed across Canada.

            <figDesc>). Studies presenting<lb/> bilateral comparisons with the United States as the reference country were also reviewed.<lb/> 241.<lb/> A study by Danzon &amp; Furukawa (2003) compares US prices of 249 molecules among the US top<lb/> 300 in 1999 to prices in eight countries, including Canada. The basket of pharmaceuticals contains both<lb/> generic and patented drug, matched by molecule and indication 85 (ATC class) and represents 56% of the<lb/> Canadian market. The authors use IMS data to compare manufacturers&apos; prices, with price discounts<lb/> furnished to big purchasers in the United States estimated at 8%. Price indexes were calculated using US<lb/> volumes of sales as weights. Canadian prices appear to be 33% lower than US prices. Prices of originator<lb/> products are 35% lower than in the United States while prices of generics are only 6% lower.<lb/> 242.<lb/> A study published in 2004 by the US Department of Commerce (ITA, 2004) compares the prices<lb/> of patented products in the United States with prices in ten OECD countries (bilateral comparisons) in<lb/> 2003. The sample is composed of the US top 54 patented prescription products containing a single<lb/> molecule, further extended to all products containing this molecule (on-or off-patent). It represents 26% of<lb/> drug sales across OECD countries, but the share of the market covered in Canada is not known. Fisher<lb/> Indexes have been calculated based on ex-manufacturer price per standard unit. Canadian prices appear to<lb/> be 46% below US prices. As US discounts have been ignored, the price differential between Canada and<lb/> the United States is overestimated.<lb/> 243.<lb/> Annual reports from the PMPRB (see 2005 report) present bilateral comparisons of Canadian ex-<lb/>factory prices of patented drugs with prices in the seven countries referred to in the regulation defining<lb/> excessive prices (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United<lb/> States). Bilateral comparisons are based on patented products available in Canada and in the comparator<lb/> country. The average foreign-to-Canadian price ratio for each product is computed, weighted by sales in<lb/> Canada. Prices are converted by current exchange rates. 86 In the 2005 report, prices of patented drugs are<lb/> 85<lb/> The paper presents also a price comparison when products are matched by molecule and form-strength. In<lb/> this case, only 35% of the Canadian market is covered, which shows how different are presentations in<lb/> these two markets.
