			<p>This paper examines the relationship between imports – and trade more generally –<lb/> and employment in France. It builds on the burgeoning literature relating trade and labour<lb/> markets, taking into account theories of firm-level trade and previous empirical work.<lb/> The renewed interest in the relationship between trade and labour markets is driven by the<lb/> availability of new data as well as a better theoretical understanding of firm-level trade.<lb/> Previous studies analysing the link between trade and employment in France were not<lb/> conclusive, leaving room for further research on the causal relationship between the two<lb/> as well as the underlying factors responsible for particular employment outcomes.<lb/> For instance, Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) examine the role of imports and exports<lb/> on employment in the manufacturing sector in France and find a negative association<lb/> between imports and employment. They distinguish between two types of imported<lb/> goods: &quot; finished goods &quot; and &quot; intermediate inputs &quot; – an approach adopted in this study as<lb/> well. They find evidence that firms importing finished goods always destroy more<lb/> employment than firms only importing intermediate inputs, which may reflect the impact<lb/> of outsourcing. Conversely, exports of finished goods have a positive employment effect<lb/> and exports of other goods a negative one. Kramarz (2010) complements Biscourp and<lb/> Kramarz (2007) by examining potential causes for these results. He attempts to verify if<lb/> foreign outsourcing, and in particular offshoring, is a possible response to the high wages<lb/> and strong unions in France. He also assesses the impact of increased outsourcing on<lb/> wages and employment. He is able to this by computing competitors&apos; importing<lb/> behaviour as well as employment changes and the strength of unions in firms. His<lb/> estimates show that the group of firms facing stronger unions indeed increased<lb/> outsourcing and, simultaneously, reduced employment over the period from 1986 to<lb/> 1992. Meanwhile, firms facing weaker unions did exactly the opposite.<lb/> The present paper builds on the findings of Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) and<lb/> Kramarz (2010), extending the previous analysis in three important ways: 1) Due to<lb/> changes in the composition of trade (in terms of products and country of destination and<lb/> origin), a more recent period is covered (<ref type="biblio">1995-2004)</ref>; 2) An industry dimension is<lb/> introduced on top of the aggregate analysis of the manufacturing sector, providing<lb/> additional insights into industry heterogeneity; 3) Finally, given that Biscourp and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Kramarz (2007)</ref> is the only study that found a negative association between imports and<lb/> employment, the analysis provided here gives further empirical scrutiny to their results.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to perform empirical analysis, this study uses data from three different<lb/> sources, merged together in a lengthy matching process:</p>

			<table>1) data on imports and exports<lb/> obtained from the French customs records; 2) data on firm-level economic variables<lb/> derived from FICUS (fichier complet unifié de SUSE or the Unified and Complete File<lb/> from SUSE); and 3) the data on employment and wages derived from the so-called<lb/> DADS (Déclaration Annuelle de Données Sociales). The analysis is divided into three<lb/> sub-periods<ref type="biblio">: 1995-1998, 1998-2001 and 2001-2004.<lb/></ref> The analysis yields unexpected results. One might have expected that an increase in<lb/> the number of imported products would be associated with substitution effects (and thus,<lb/> decreased employment) and that an increase in the number of exported products might be<lb/> associated with an expansionary effect (and thus, increased employment). The study,<lb/> however, finds contrary evidence. Namely, when the number of exported products<lb/> increases, the effect on employment in France is clearly negative for all periods.<lb/> Interestingly, an opposite phenomenon appears to be associated with an increase in the<lb/> number of products imported: more products imported are associated with an increase in<lb/> employment. Across various specifications and samples the main message remains<lb/> robust: export intensity is associated with employment losses. Moreover, the finding that<lb/> purchases of final goods, including imports, put negative pressure on employment, while<lb/> there is no such relation between purchases of intermediates and employment, is<lb/> consistent with the results in Biscourp and Kramarz (2007). The analysis of imports using<lb/> such a division into goods and intermediates yields yet finer results, which vary from<lb/> period to period. The impact of exports on employment growth is, however, negative in<lb/> each and every sub-period.<lb/></p>

			<p>The industry-level analysis further confirms these findings. First, all of the<lb/> manufacturing industries covered in the study tend to lose jobs. Second, in an<lb/> overwhelming number of cases, growth of exports is associated with employment losses<lb/> (the only exception is the automobile industry between 1995 and 1998). In addition, for<lb/> most industries, but equipment goods, increased purchases of goods are associated with<lb/> decreased employment. In the equipment goods industry a clearly positive employment<lb/> impact of increased purchases of goods might reflect the nature of investment goods<lb/> imported in this case.<lb/> Overall, there are some general patterns in our findings that appear to be stable. In<lb/> most cases, the association between export growth and employment creation does not go<lb/> necessarily in the expected direction. Similarly, import growth has effects on employment<lb/> that vary with the period and the industry. Finally, the most stable factor affecting<lb/> employment negatively appears to be purchases of goods, either from a French firm or<lb/> from a foreign one. The estimates obtained when distinguishing between imports of<lb/> goods and imports of intermediates are reminiscent of those of Biscourp and Kramarz<lb/> (2007). Interestingly, the papers that have tried to reproduce those results for other<lb/> countries have not managed to find the same effect. Hence, the findings presented here<lb/> for the recent period together with those for the period from 1986 to 1992 in Biscourp and<lb/> Kramarz (2007) seem to vindicate those by <ref type="biblio">Kramarz (2010)</ref>, for whom offshoring in<lb/> France is a result of strong unions – a French specificity.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The literature relating trade and labour markets is burgeoning. Many reasons explain<lb/> this renewed interest. First, theories of firm-level trade have become widely available and<lb/> accepted. <ref type="biblio">Melitz (2003)</ref> is the leading contender. Namely, his study introduces firm<lb/> heterogeneity in a General Equilibrium framework and clearly enriches our understanding<lb/> of firms trading. Second, data are a factor. Firm-level measures of total exports were used<lb/> in a series of papers by Bernard and Jensen to document firm behaviour.<lb/> Recently, data and theory were brought together in a structural framework strongly<lb/> confirming the validity of a modified Melitz model (Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz,<lb/> forthcoming). Because the firm was the unit of observation, a set of papers started to look<lb/> at labour market variables (essentially wages and employment) in conjunction with firm-<lb/>level trade activity. These papers, mostly empirical, have shown the potential positive<lb/> impact of exports on wages and employment, apparently because these exporting firms<lb/> had better productivity than their non-exporting equivalents. In addition, the recently<lb/> available matched employer-employee data sources have allowed analysts to capture a<lb/> more complete view of the labour market by looking at individual wages within the trade<lb/> environment.<lb/></p>

			<p>These empirical efforts have been recently vindicated by various theoretical<lb/> frameworks designed to capture the lessons of Melitz&apos; success in modelling firms&apos;<lb/> exporting behaviour while simultaneously introducing the labour market, often within the<lb/> Mortensen-Pissarides perspective, as a way of modelling frictions. The most prominent<lb/> example is Helpman, Itzhokhi, Redding (2010). Other proposals are on the table and one<lb/> of them mixing Melitz with the concept of bargaining has been proposed by Eaton,<lb/> Kortum, Kramarz and Sampognaro (2011). Work in this area is ongoing and any new<lb/> findings will, admittedly, be most welcome. This is what I propose here in this empirical-<lb/>descriptive contribution. I will first summarize previous findings from an earlier study on<lb/> a similar question, which used a similar type of approach for France for the period from<lb/> 1986 to 1992. Then, I will describe the multiple data sources that were used for the<lb/> present paper. In the next section, I will present aggregate results, followed by estimates<lb/> for different manufacturing industries. Finally, I will briefly conclude outlining possible<lb/> explanations for our potentially surprising findings.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Previous findings for France<lb/></head>

			<p>Following Bernard and Jensen (1997), Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) adopt a very<lb/> descriptive perspective in order to examine the role of imports and exports on<lb/> employment. Their empirical analysis comprises three stages. First, they study the<lb/> relation between trade and job creation and job destruction in the manufacturing sector<lb/> using a quasi-exhaustive panel of firms. This file includes, in particular, very small firms.<lb/> Then, they examine the relation between trade and skill structure, using measures of the<lb/> share of production jobs in total employment of manufacturing firms and of the fraction<lb/> of unskilled workers within these production jobs. Unfortunately, the size of the sample is<lb/> reduced because the Survey on Skill Structure includes only establishments with at least<lb/> 20 employees. Following the literature they apportion the total job changes to between-<lb/>industry effects, within-industry but between-firm effects, and within-firms effects of<lb/> skill changes. Finally, they examine the robustness of their results by introducing firm-<lb/>level measures of innovation, which control for changes in the technology environment.<lb/></p>

			<p>These authors find evidence that firms importing &quot; finished goods &quot; (FG) always<lb/> destroy more employment than firms only importing &quot; intermediary inputs &quot; (II),<lb/> conditional on changes in local purchases. The former type of imports may reflect<lb/> outsourcing strategies. Imports from low-wage countries have a slightly more negative<lb/> association than average imports, but the difference is minor. Exports of &quot; finished<lb/> goods &quot; , i.e. of goods normally produced by the firm, are positively associated with<lb/> employment changes, but exports of other goods have a robust negative effect, potentially<lb/> reflecting FDI.<lb/> Turning to skills, they find the usual result, i.e. that most changes occur within firms,<lb/> a fact often interpreted as evidence of skill-biased technical change. Using a regression<lb/> framework, Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) find that FG imports have a negative<lb/> association with production labour, as well as unskilled labour (at least in the largest<lb/> firms). Controlling for innovation taking place at the firm level does not alter any of their<lb/> conclusions.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Kramarz (2010)</ref> complements Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) in his study of potential<lb/> causes for these results. The paper notes that imports from developing countries to the<lb/> United States or Western Europe were not huge at the end of the 1980s. However, the<lb/> Single Market Program (SMP, hereafter), an attempt to establish the European<lb/> Community&apos;s (EC, hereafter) internal market, was conceived in 1985 and launched in<lb/> 1988, with the hope of being fully implemented around 1992. This entailed decreased<lb/> tariffs and barriers within the EC. Hence, imports from the EC increased at a very rapid<lb/> pace in France during the second half of the 1980s. 1 In this context, the mere existence of<lb/> 1.<lb/> French National accounts show that imports increased at a very fast rate over the years 1986 to<lb/> 1992: above 6% per year in the first five years with a decrease in the pace of expansion to 3% in<lb/> 1991 and 2% in the final year. In fact, whereas import growth was at best mild between 1981 and<lb/> 1985, our sample period appears to be the beginning of a period of</p>

			<table>rapid growth for French<lb/> imports<lb/> that<lb/> continued<lb/> most<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> ensuing<lb/> years.<lb/> www.insee.fr/fr/indicateur/cnat_annu/Series/t_1501p_25_4.xls (accessed 5 April 2005). In<lb/> addition, Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) show that imports from low-wage countries were -and<lb/> remained – a minor, albeit increasing, component of imports of goods over the analysis period.<lb/> However, when measuring imports of manufacturing goods as a fraction of GDP, the ratio was<lb/> 14% in 1986 (as well as in the preceding years -1981 to 1985). It increased to 17% in 1989-1990<lb/> and 16% in 1992.<lb/> (www.insee.fr/fr/indicateur/cnat_annu/base_95/principaux_resultats/commerce_ext.htm/t_1501bis<lb/> _95.xls and t_1105_95.xls (accessed 26 February 2008).<lb/></table>

			<p>new sourcing options was a signal that foreign outsourcing was a potential threat, in<lb/> particular for industries or firms in which high wages were due to the presence of strong<lb/> unions and the absence of product market competition. At the same time, and for the<lb/> same reasons, because European firms could export to France more easily, French firms<lb/> faced increased market pressures, not from Beijing but from other European countries.<lb/> Similarly, in the United States, union plants and firms started to lose employment in<lb/> the 1980s. Many such plants were located in the North and new plants started to open in<lb/> the non-union South. Foreign-owned car plants started opening in the second half of the<lb/> 1980s, in particular around Interstate 85. 2 This move to the South also took place in other<lb/> industries (see the example of RCA in its various guises described in <ref type="biblio">Cowie, 1999</ref>). Of<lb/> course, in the case of the United States, &quot; imports &quot; may not be the right word and the<lb/> evidence that unions caused job losses and the associated outsourcing, be it local or<lb/> foreign, is missing. But, France is a small country when compared with the United States;<lb/> what is local outsourcing in the United States may be foreign in the analogous situation in<lb/> France (to the East though, rather than to the South, at least during the analysis period).<lb/></p>

			<p>The two questions that Kramarz (2010) examines derive from a previous paper: 1) In<lb/> a context of increased competitive pressures and expanded opportunities due to the SMP,<lb/> was foreign outsourcing, in particular the foreign outsourcing of final goods (offshoring,<lb/> hereafter), a possible response to the high wages and strong unions, in particular in those<lb/> years that followed the election of the French socialist government?; 2) And, indeed, what<lb/> was the impact of increased outsourcing on wages and employment? 3<lb/></p>

			<p>Even though macro-economists have examined these questions both theoretically and<lb/> empirically, at the country-or the industry-level, there is virtually no micro-econometric<lb/> analysis, no empirical examination of the precise mechanisms at work using microdata<lb/> sources. Kramarz (2010) looks at the effects that can be identified in the French context<lb/> using differences across and within firms, rather than across industries. More precisely,<lb/> because he has access to administrative data on the nature and amount of imports and<lb/> exports measured at firm-level in France (final goods versus intermediates), he observes<lb/> all firms that outsource intermediates or final goods, and he can compute the firms&apos;<lb/> competitors importing behaviour. Moreover, thanks to access to administrative data on<lb/> balance-sheets and employment, he can compute the firms&apos; value-added or employment.<lb/> Also, by virtue of having access to a survey on union behaviour, he can compute the<lb/> strength of unions in most firms. Finally, because he uses administrative longitudinal<lb/> matched employer-employee data on wages, he can measure the changes in individual,<lb/> not aggregate, wages.<lb/> A clear answer to Kramarz (2010)&apos;s questions would contribute to at least two strands<lb/> of the literature. First, it would inform the wage inequality debate. 4 Second,</p>

On the other,<lb/> Wood (1995) has accused trade of being responsible for the deteriorated position of unskilled<lb/> workers while Leamer (1994) and (1996), and Freeman (1995) appear to stand in the middle.<lb/> Unfortunately, evidence is not compelling and mostly relies on import penetration measured at the<lb/> 10 – EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004)<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124© OECD 2011<lb/></table>

			<p>product market competition is a potential underlying mechanism affecting the labour<lb/> market, an answer would also contribute to the literature that examines the relationship<lb/> between wages, bargaining institutions, and profits. 5<lb/></p>

			<p>To understand the identification strategy that Kramarz (2010) pursues, the following<lb/> thought experiment is helpful. French manufacturing was relatively protected from<lb/> international competition at the beginning of the 1980s. In addition, a relatively large<lb/> fraction of firms were state-owned (as compared to other similar Western European<lb/> countries), in particular after the election of President François Mitterrand. This lack of<lb/> competition induced the creation of rents (a result documented in Abowd, Kramarz,<lb/> Lengermann, and <ref type="biblio">Roux, 2007</ref>). Because of these rents as well as the bargaining<lb/> institutions, many French firms bargained with their workers, but not all. These<lb/> bargaining regimes varied from firm to firm. Some unions were in better position to seize<lb/> the potential rents. However, all firms were hit by exogenous foreign competition shocks.<lb/> In particular, all French firms were affected by the introduction of SMP at the end of the<lb/> 1980s, facing increased foreign competition and increased opportunities for outsourcing.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Biscourp and Kramarz (2007)</ref>, based on the same data on trade (imports as well as<lb/> exports) and on firms, also covering the same time period that I use in the present paper,<lb/> have shown that import growth (of final goods) was strongly associated with employment<lb/> losses. They show an association, but no causal relationship. The increased imports from<lb/> competitors&apos; or increased outsourcing had, nevertheless, the potential to affect the<lb/> bargaining process because they were likely to change a firm&apos;s ability to pay the workers<lb/> – the size of the quasi-rent – as well as the firm&apos;s and the workers&apos; threat points. What<lb/> happened to wages and employment in these different firms and under these different<lb/> bargaining regimes? How did unions react? If Kramarz (2010) is able to show, both<lb/> theoretically and empirically, that strong unions caused offshoring, which in turn caused<lb/> employment and wage losses, he has found a causal mechanism for Biscourp and<lb/> Kramarz&apos;s result.<lb/></p>

			<p>With these thought experiments in the back of our minds, let us now present the<lb/> structure of Kramarz&apos;s paper. To capture the influence of outsourcing threats on<lb/> bargaining, Kramarz starts by presenting a simple model, particularly well-suited to the<lb/> French institutional setup studied here. It will help us capture the mechanisms through<lb/> which a firm&apos;s outsourcing of final goods can directly affect wages and employment. In<lb/> particular, the model shows that, with imperfect competition in the product market, firms<lb/> facing strong unions are likely to use offshoring more intensively than firms facing<lb/> weaker unions. This is because increased offshoring reduces the size of the rent that the<lb/> union and the firm bargain over. Indeed, offshoring acts as a threat point in the bargaining<lb/> process and disciplines workers. 6 Furthermore, in this context, employment decreases<lb/> aggregate or at the sectoral level (see for instance Revenga, 1992, see however Bernard and<lb/> Jensen, 1997 or the book edited by <ref type="biblio">Robert Feenstra, 2000</ref>).<lb/> 5.<lb/> Abowd and Lemieux (1993) examine the relation between product market competition and wages<lb/> in a bargaining framework whereas Blanchflower, Oswald and Sanfey (1996) look at the more<lb/> general relation between profits and wages. Goldberg and Tracy (2001) as well as Bertrand (2004)<lb/> focus on recent changes induced by increased import competition and movements in exchange<lb/> rates. Unfortunately, these last authors used industry-level measures of imports because of the lack<lb/> of firm-level data.<lb/> 6.<lb/> A threat point, also known as the disagreement point v in a game-theoretical context of<lb/> bargaining, is the value the players can expect to receive if negotiations break down and no<lb/> bargain can be reached.<lb/> EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004) – 11<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124 © OECD 2011<lb/></table>

			<p>when offshoring increases. But, wages do not necessarily decrease (as they are the<lb/> outcome of the bargaining process, albeit with altered payoff scenarios).<lb/> Kramarz&apos;s (2010) empirical analysis starts by showing how foreign outsourcing and,<lb/> more generally, trade competition are related to the size of the rents at the end of the<lb/> 1980s in French manufacturing. In particular, using a size-of-the-firm discontinuity<lb/> present within French institutions, he shows that bargaining institutions are likely to cause<lb/> the observed structure of this relationship. Because bargaining institutions matter and, in<lb/> particular, unions&apos; strength, he identifies which firms face strong unions, i.e. unions with a<lb/> strong bargaining power, and which firms face weaker unions. To do this, he estimates a<lb/> structural wage equation that directly identifies unions&apos; bargaining power. His use of<lb/> matched employer-employee data sources allows him to directly measure the various<lb/> components of this structural equation.<lb/> Kramarz&apos;s (2010) estimates demonstrate that there are essentially two types of firms,<lb/> depending on their bargaining regime: 1) firms facing strong unions in which workers<lb/> capture half of the rents and 2) firms facing weaker unions where workers are paid their<lb/> opportunity wage. Moreover, he highlights that workers are negatively affected by import<lb/> competition. Finally, the paper shows that the first group of firms (i.e. with strong unions)<lb/> indeed increased outsourcing and, simultaneously, reduced employment over the 1986-<lb/>1992 period, as predicted by the model, whereas the second group (i.e. firms with weaker<lb/> unions) did exactly the opposite.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several additional elements, absent from the above papers, which deserve<lb/> attention. First, the time period covered by the studies is from 1986 to 1992. There is a<lb/> good reason for this: after 1992, customs data do not capture the full extent of trade since<lb/> all movements within the European Union that are below a given threshold are not<lb/> reported anymore. However, the composition of trade (in terms of products and country<lb/> of destination or origin) has obviously changed. Second, the analysis was performed for<lb/> manufactures in the aggregate. Some industry dimension would certainly be useful.<lb/> Third, the results found in the above paper (<ref type="biblio">Biscourp and Kramarz, 2007</ref>) show a<lb/> negative association between employment and imports. It is the only paper having found<lb/> such results (a Danish paper finds a positive correlation for small and medium size firms<lb/> and a negative relation for larger firms). A natural question then ensues: Why? And who<lb/> is right?<lb/> For instance, the role of unions in the firms&apos; decision to offshore has not been<lb/> extensively studied. Can we find similar results to the ones above when examining the<lb/> period from 1995 to -2004 (for which similar data are available)? Some of these questions<lb/> are addressed in the following analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Data description<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper uses data from various sources. First, I will describe the data on imports<lb/> and exports (Customs). Then, I will explain the data on firm-level economic variables<lb/> (FICUS). Also, I will present a third source, the so-called DADS, with data on<lb/> employment (and potentially wages), coming from LEED (Longitudinal Employer-<lb/>Employee Data). Finally, I will describe the lengthy control and matching process of<lb/> these three data sets.<lb/></p>

			<head>The customs data set<lb/></head>

			<p>Up to 1992 all shipments of goods entering or leaving France were declared to French<lb/> customs either by their owners or by authorized customs commissioners. Starting in 1993,<lb/> only shipments above a certain level (essentially 1 million French Francs) for and from<lb/> countries within Europe were declared (different denominations and composition had to<lb/> be declared depending on the year). However, firms often declared amounts below the<lb/> threshold. Hence, I keep every declaration. These declarations constitute the basis of all<lb/> French trade statistics. Each shipment generates a record. Each record contains the firm<lb/> identifier, the SIREN – a unique number that identified each firm in France, the country<lb/> of origin (for imports) or destination (for exports), a product identifier (a 6-digit<lb/> classification), and a date. All records are aggregated first at the monthly level. In the data<lb/> files accessible to researchers, these records are further aggregated by year and by 3-digit<lb/> product (NAP 100 classification, the equivalent of the 3-digit SIC code) until 1992 and,<lb/> for the period from 1995 to 2004 that I study, I kept a more disaggregated (4-digit)<lb/> product classification. Therefore, each observation is identified by a SIREN, a product<lb/> code, a country code, an import or export code, and a year. In the following analysis, I<lb/> restrict attention to all firms in the manufacturing sector in <ref type="biblio">years 1995, 1998, 2001</ref>, and in<lb/> year 2004. Hence, I aggregate across manufacturing products exported or imported. I can,<lb/> thus, measure each firm&apos;s amount of total exports and imports in the four sample years<lb/> that I examine by country of destination or origin. Transactions are recorded in French<lb/> Francs and reflect the amount received by the firm (i.e. including discounts, rebates, etc.).<lb/> Because I also use data produced after 2002, all amounts have been translated into Euros<lb/> in order to allow comparisons. For instance, the data in 2001 has 4 455 014 observations.<lb/> Aggregated by firm, there are 118 562 observations for imports and 120,793 for exports.<lb/></p>

			<p>To obtain more detailed information about the type of product imported, I follow<lb/> Biscourp and Kramarz in defining two types: intermediates and finished goods.<lb/> Whenever the product classification of the imported product is within the same<lb/> classification as that defining the main activity of the firm (at the 4-digit level), the<lb/> imported product is labelled &quot; finished good &quot; ; otherwise it is labelled &quot; intermediate &quot; .<lb/> Roughly, two-thirds of the imported products are intermediates.<lb/></p>

			<head>The FICUS data set<lb/></head>

			<p>The FICUS data base provides firm-level information. FICUS is the outcome of the<lb/> SUSE system, (SUSE stands for Système Unifié de Statistique d&apos;Entreprises or Unified<lb/> System of Firm-level Statistics). Its goal is to establish a consistent set of firm-level<lb/> variables and statistics by the joint use of two base sources. The first one is fiscal in its<lb/> origin and groups the bénéfices industriels et commerciaux (BIC) and the bénéfices non<lb/> commerciaux (BNC), two fiscal regimes that cover essentially all French firms. The other<lb/> one, the annual survey of firms (EAE. enquête annuelle d&apos;entreprises) is statistical in<lb/> nature and is the outcome of a complex procedure in which both the Ministry of Industry<lb/> and the industry branches, as represented by the business unions, take part. It allows the<lb/> analyst to study the productive system from various angles: production, inputs, revenue<lb/> and expense accounts, balance-sheet and economic performance of firms. To facilitate the<lb/> exploitation of this complex and rich source, a unique file has been created, the so-called<lb/> FICUS (fichier complet unifié de SUSE, the unified and complete file from SUSE)<lb/> mentioned earlier. This file essentially covers all firms and all fiscal regimes, with the<lb/> exception of the micro-BIC (very small firms with sales below EUR 80 000 in 2011,<lb/> EUR 35 000 for service firms), agricultural firms (Bénéfice Agricole) and farms under the<lb/> BIC regime. It also contains all industries except for agriculture, both for metropolitan<lb/> France and the overseas departments. Furthermore, it includes a broad but limited number<lb/> of economic and accounting variables (simplified balance sheet and simplified revenue<lb/> and expense accounts). For instance, it contains total sales, total labour costs, value-<lb/>added, total employment, total purchases and profits. Focusing on three sub-periods of<lb/> low inflation, <ref type="biblio">1995-1998, 1998-2001, and 2001-2004</ref>, I use these variables measured in<lb/> nominal terms. In 2001, the number of observations in the initial FICUS file is 2 270 955.<lb/></p>

			<head>The DADS data set<lb/></head>

			<p>The DADS (Déclaration Annuelle de Données Sociales) comprises all records of<lb/> wages of all employees, as declared by employers to the tax authority. It is then compiled<lb/> into an exhaustive data set organized by pairs of years, by establishment and number of<lb/> workers within a given establishment. Hence, the year t file comprises all employees<lb/> within a given establishment for year t-1 and year t. When a worker is present in both<lb/> years in the establishment, there is a single line. When he/she is present in t-1, all year t<lb/> variables are missing, and conversely for year t. Viewed from a worker perspective, there<lb/> is a unique person identifier and, hence, it is possible to a have a comprehensive view of<lb/> each worker&apos;s employers and wages. The total wages given to any person are then<lb/> compared by the tax authority to the income declaration that each household has to file<lb/> every year. Starting from 2009, the declared wages are automatically inserted onto the<lb/> income declaration form by the tax authority, which is therefore pre-filled. Each<lb/> individual record includes the start date and the end date of the spell, the number of<lb/> hours, and the gross and the net earnings that accrued to the worker during the spell for<lb/> each of the two years t-1 and t. It also includes the skill level (3-or more often 2-digits<lb/> classification), sex and nationality of the worker. From this file, I performed an<lb/> aggregation at different levels.<lb/> First, the data are aggregated by establishment and year, for year t going from 1996 to<lb/> 2003. It allows me to compute various measures of employment, weighted or not by<lb/> hours and days of work within each year. Second, the data are examined at the individual-<lb/>, establishment-, and year-level as follows. Establishments can be destroyed and created<lb/> with no change in economic activity when, in particular, they move from one location in a<lb/> locality to another location within the same locality. Hence, there is potentially too much<lb/> employment creation and destruction. To control for this process, I do the following. I<lb/> take all those workers within an establishment who move to another establishment either<lb/> of the same firm or from a different firm within the same locality. If the fraction of such<lb/> workers is &quot; large &quot; enough with respect to the establishment employment, then the new<lb/> establishment is further examined. First, it is checked that it was not in existence<lb/> previously. Similarly, it is checked that the old establishment does not exist afterwards.<lb/> Then, if they both belong to the same firm, the new establishment is &quot; connected &quot; to the<lb/> old one and it is treated as if there were no establishment creation or destruction. If these<lb/> establishments do not belong to the same firm, then I checked whether it is a particular<lb/> establishment within the two firms that received a transfer of most workers. If not, then if<lb/> all establishments of the origin firm have &quot; most &quot; workers transferred to the same number<lb/> of establishments of the destination firm, and then it is considered that there is no<lb/> establishment creation or destruction. Using this procedure, I compute employment<lb/> (weighted by days) for each year between 1995 and 2004 at the establishment level. It is<lb/> then aggregated at the firm level, using all available establishments, once checked for<lb/> their true birth or death as described just above. In 2001, there are 2 039 199<lb/> establishments from all industries for which we try to measure employment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Matching of the three files<lb/></head>

			<figure>First, I match FICUS with the DADS file at the establishment level. In 2001, the<lb/> resulting data set has 2 100 438 observations. Then, the equivalent file for 2004<lb/> (2 367 270 observations) is matched with that of 2001. Then, this matched file (2 806 116<lb/> observations) is restricted to the manufacturing firms (excluding extractive industries)<lb/> with positive sales either in 2001 or in 2004. The file has now 241 702 observations<lb/> (establishments). However, some firms may well be absent from the DADS when they<lb/> have no salaried employees and still be in FICUS (with zero employees in both 2001 and<lb/> 2004). These firms are also kept, resulting in a data set with 288 460 observations (again<lb/> establishments). These establishments are then aggregated at the firm level, resulting in<lb/> 240 447 unique firms present in 2001, 2004 or both. These observations are now matched<lb/> with the customs data file to enter the trade activity. Since most firms do not trade (import<lb/> or export) in any of these years, we keep all firms from the previous match. For the period<lb/> 1998-2001, the number of firms is 254 621 and for the period 1995-2001, the number of<lb/> firms is 261 056.<lb/></figure>

			<p>These files contain all relevant variables. However, measurement errors in the<lb/> variables of interest may well have slightly decreased the size of some of our analysis<lb/> files. We will see in what follows that the measurement error is indeed a serious issue<lb/> with no easy escape-strategy.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> Aggregate estimation results<lb/></head>

			<p>In this section, I present estimates of equations that relate employment and trade<lb/> activity at the firm-level for French manufacturing firms. These equations are descriptive<lb/> and should be seen as descriptive with little causal interpretation offered. They must be<lb/> considered as the first stage of a more ambitious program, including the search for<lb/> potential instruments or, more probably, the estimation of a structural model for<lb/> exporting/importing firms with their associated consequences on employment.<lb/> Let me first describe the estimated relations. I compute the rate of growth as follows<lb/> (in the spirit of <ref type="biblio">Davis and Haltiwanger, 1999</ref>). First, there are three sample periods: <ref type="biblio">1995-<lb/>1998, 1998-2001, and 2001-2004.</ref> Then, I define employment of firm i at the beginning<lb/> and at the end of each sample period as<lb/></p>

				<formula>B<lb/> i<lb/> L and<lb/> E<lb/> i<lb/> L .</formula>

			<table>Average employment over the<lb/> period is defined as<lb/> 2<lb/> E<lb/> i<lb/> B<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> L<lb/> L<lb/> L<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> and I use it to compute employment growth in the<lb/> firm over the period:<lb/> EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE IN FRANCE: A FIRM-LEVEL VIEW (1995-2004) – 15<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER N°124 © OECD 2011<lb/></table>

				<formula>i<lb/> B<lb/> i<lb/> E<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> L<lb/> L<lb/> L<lb/> L<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>To describe these data further, I apply a simple regression analysis to the set of all<lb/> (continuing, dead or newly born) firms. Again, I do not attach any causal interpretation to<lb/> my specification or results. More precisely, for each of my three sample periods, I<lb/> estimate the following simple first-difference regression:<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> Z<lb/> Tr<lb/> L<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (1)<lb/> where i<lb/> L<lb/> </formula>

			<p>is the employment growth rate for firm i during the sample period (defined as<lb/></p>

				<formula>before),<lb/> i<lb/> Tr<lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>is a vector of measures of trade growth at firm i (described just below),<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> Z<lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>is a vector of measures of economic shocks potentially affecting firm i (also<lb/> described just below), and i<lb/>  is an i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) shock.<lb/> My vector of measures of internationalization includes the change in imports (or exports)<lb/> between the beginning and the end of the period as a fraction of sales. To control for<lb/> shocks that might have affected the firm,<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> Z<lb/>  includes</formula>

			<p>the growth rate of firm&apos;s total<lb/> sales (computed à la Davis and Haltiwanger), the change in the ratio of firm&apos;s goods<lb/> purchases to total sales, and the change in the ratio of firm&apos;s intermediates purchases to<lb/> total sales. The regression is weighted either by average employment i<lb/> L or by average<lb/> sales. Various robustness checks are estimated and presented.<lb/> The first and simplest specification, in which<lb/> i<lb/> Z<lb/>  only includes total sales growth<lb/> rate, is presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Furthermore, the set of observations is restricted to those for<lb/> which the discrepancy between employment change between the beginning and the end<lb/> of the sample period as measured with FICUS and as measured with the DADS is<lb/> &quot; small &quot; . Here, &quot; small &quot; means 1 000 in absolute value. There are many potential reasons<lb/> for such differences. They have to be explored further. The set of such firms is quite<lb/> small (look at the number of observations at the bottom of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and at the bottom of<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). There are less than a hundred firms in each sample period, but these firms are<lb/> potentially large at either the beginning or the end of each sample period. Hence, their<lb/> inclusion might affect the estimated results. This is something I will check later in the<lb/> text.<lb/></p>

			<p>The estimates of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> show that employment essentially decreased in<lb/> manufacturing in each period (even though the variables are not cantered, their means are<lb/> very close to zero). They also show that sales go hand in hand with employment changes.<lb/> Finally, focusing on our main variables of interest, changes in export intensity (measured<lb/> as a ratio of the change in the level of exports to average sales over the sample period)<lb/> has a depressing effect on employment, whereas the effect of changes in import intensity<lb/> appear to be small, but there is large variation. Again, there is no causal meaning that can<lb/> easily be attached to such results. For instance, firms might have decreased employment<lb/> and, therefore, reduced their costs in order to increase their exporting capacity. However,<lb/> controlling for changes in sales reduces the potential for such an interpretation.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> is similar in spirit to <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Some firm variables are added to the regression<lb/> as control variables. Before discussing them, it must be noted that none of the previous<lb/> conclusions is altered. The variables that were added to the initial ones are measures of<lb/> changes in the reach of the firm. Because customs data allow me to know the destinations<lb/> and origins of the exports and imports, respectively, I can compute the changes in this<lb/> number of destinations and origins. Because customs data allow me to know the products<lb/> imported or exported, I can compute changes in quantities, with the underlying idea that<lb/> an increase in the number of imported products might be associated with substitution<lb/> effects, whereas an increase in the number of exported products might be associated with<lb/> an expansionary strategy. In fact, this presumption appears to be turned on its head. When<lb/> the number of exported products increases, the effect on employment in France is clearly<lb/> negative for all periods. Interestingly, the opposite phenomenon appears to be associated<lb/> with an increase in the number of products imported: more products imported are<lb/> associated with an increase in employment. As for the number of countries, increasing the<lb/> number of destinations is &quot; good &quot; for employment and increasing the number of sourcing<lb/> countries is &quot; good &quot; in two sub-periods.<lb/></p>

			<p>Using data from the DADS, it is possible to compute the number of new, ongoing,<lb/> and closed establishments over each sample period. By using the location of these<lb/> establishments, it is also possible to measure the change in geographic dispersion of the<lb/> firm within France. Results from <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> show that a larger number of permanent<lb/> (ongoing) establishments is always associated with employment losses. Similarly, an<lb/> increase in geographic dispersion across French establishments is associated with an<lb/> increase in employment. However, the effects of new openings and closures appear more<lb/> complex. First, the addition of a new establishment has a negative impact in two of the<lb/> three sub-periods. Second, the impact of the closure of an establishment has to be<lb/> computed from the sum of the &quot; closed establishments &quot; effect and the sum of changes in<lb/> the number of establishments (applying a value of minus one). Hence, the effect of the<lb/> closure of one establishment is positive in <ref type="biblio">1995-1998, negative in 1998-2001, and<lb/> essentially zero in 2001-2004 (notice that 2001</ref> is the starting date of a clear decrease in<lb/> manufacturing employment, as measured in aggregate statistics). The underlying impact<lb/> of globalisation on establishments&apos; operations is clearly hard to capture from these simple<lb/> regressions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The next regressions test the robustness of those that I have just presented using<lb/> various strategies. First, I add two variables in the base equation to control for purchases<lb/> of the firm: the change in purchases of intermediates and the change in purchases of<lb/> goods (both as a ratio of total sales). Results are presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. They clearly show<lb/> elements of consistency with the results from Biscourp and Kramarz (2007): goods play a<lb/> role that appears to widely differ from that played by intermediates. Purchases of goods,<lb/> including imports, destroy employment, whereas there is no such relation between<lb/> employment and purchases of intermediates. 7<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> presents results of regressions that use the same variables as in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> but<lb/> with a different weighting scheme. Rather than using average employment in the period, I<lb/> use average sales in the period. Results are very similar to those presented above. The<lb/> coefficients on export-and import intensity are of the same sign. This is also true for the<lb/> coefficients for the change in the purchases of goods (still negative).<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> uses again the same variables and the same weighting scheme, but includes<lb/> all observations; in particular those for which estimates of changes in employment<lb/> computed using the DADS and using FICUS were very different. The main message is<lb/> that export intensity is associated with employment losses, similarly to changes in the<lb/> purchases of goods. These points seem very robust across specifications and samples.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> adds a further twist to the previous specification by distinguishing imports<lb/> using the two product types, as defined above: imports of finished goods on one side<lb/> (when the imported product is of the same industry as that of the firm) and imports of<lb/> intermediates for all other products (see also <ref type="biblio">Biscourp and Kramarz, 2010</ref>). In reading the<lb/> table, it is important to note that it reflects the separate, simultaneous inclusion of<lb/> purchases (including imports) of goods and intermediates. Notice first that most<lb/> coefficients in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> are quite similar to those in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. However, those that change<lb/> sign and magnitude are those of purchases and imports of intermediates. Results are not<lb/> stable from period to period. For the first sub-period, all purchases of goods, be they<lb/> imports or local, have a similar negative effect on employment. Purchases of<lb/> intermediates from France have a negative impact while purchases of intermediates from<lb/> outside France (the sum of the two coefficients) have an essentially zero effect. For the<lb/> 1998-2001 sub-period, signs swap and magnitudes are altered. The imports of goods have<lb/> a greater, more negative, impact on employment than local purchases of goods. As for<lb/> intermediates, local purchases have a mildly positive impact on employment while<lb/> foreign purchases have a quite negative impact. Finally, for the later sub-period, local<lb/> purchases of goods and intermediates have a negative impact on employment growth,<lb/> whereas foreign purchases (imports) of goods and intermediates have a clearly positive<lb/> impact on employment. Finally, the impact of exports on employment growth is again<lb/> negative in each and every sub-period.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> Industry-level estimation results<lb/></head>

			<p>Because the way trade is connected to labour market outcomes may vary significantly<lb/> from industry to industry, the next section examines the estimates resulting from<lb/> equations similar to the one presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, by industry. The industries analyzed<lb/> here are based on a classic decomposition of manufacturing industries. I use the following<lb/> list: automobile, consumption goods, equipment goods, intermediate goods, and agro-<lb/>industries. Except for the automobile industry, the number of firms (observations) is<lb/> relatively similar across sectors, even though the structure of these firms is quite different<lb/> (in terms of skill structure and capital stock, among other characteristics).<lb/> Estimates are presented in <ref type="table">Table 7a</ref> to <ref type="table">Table 7e</ref>. First, all these industries tend to lose<lb/> jobs. Second, in an overwhelming number of cases, growth of exports is associated with<lb/> employment losses (the only exception is automobile between 1995 and 1998). Finally,<lb/> there is no obvious regularity in the sign of the relationship between changes in imports<lb/> and job creation or destruction.<lb/> In a further analysis, I redid the regression with purchases included (as in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> or<lb/> 4), by industry. Results were quite similar to those shown in Tables 7a to 7e. In addition,<lb/> for most industries, but equipment goods, increased purchases of goods were associated<lb/> with decreased employment. However, in the equipment goods industry, increased<lb/> purchases of goods were clearly associated with increased employment, reflecting<lb/> potentially the nature of investment goods imported in this case.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/> Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>This version of the paper has examined, in France, the relation between imports, and<lb/> trade more generally, and employment. There are some simple patterns in our findings<lb/> that appear to be stable. In most cases, the association between export growth and<lb/> employment creation does not go necessarily in the expected direction. Similarly, import<lb/> growth has effects on employment that vary with the period and the industry. Finally, the<lb/> most stable factor affecting employment negatively appears to be purchases of goods,<lb/> either from a French firm or from a foreign one. The estimates obtained when<lb/> distinguishing between imports of goods and imports of intermediates are reminiscent of<lb/> those of Biscourp and Kramarz (2007). Interestingly, the papers that have tried to<lb/> reproduce those results for other countries have not managed to find the same effect.<lb/> Hence, the present findings for the recent period together with those for the period from<lb/> 1986 to 1992 in Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) vindicate those by <ref type="biblio">Kramarz (2010)</ref>, for<lb/> whom offshoring in France is a result of strong unions, a French specificity.<lb/> Is it possible to provide a &quot; unified &quot; interpretation for these results? Well, in France<lb/> manufacturing industries are characterized by the prevalence and overall strength of very<lb/> large firms, with a lack of what Germans call Mittelstand, i.e. middle-size firms. If we<lb/> adopt a life-cycle view of a firm, those firms that are large essentially tend to downsize<lb/> their operations in France and expand them abroad (at the same time exporting more<lb/> globally), in particular by producing more and more goods in countries other than France.<lb/> Indeed, they appear to be pushed to do this because of unions, if we believe Kramarz&apos;s<lb/> (2010) results. Now, smaller firms in France that aspire to grow have difficulties in<lb/> expanding in their home market. Many reasons may explain this: engineers and business<lb/> graduates (in general, alumni from the Grandes Ecoles system) going almost exclusively<lb/> to very large firms, lack of product market competition, state support to national<lb/> champions, high firing costs discouraging firms from growing and workers from moving<lb/> from firm to firm, among other factors. Hence, we may observe in the data a (somewhat<lb/> surprising) statistical association between export growth and employment decrease. The<lb/> observed estimates are driven mostly by the behaviour of large firms and their pattern of<lb/> export growth, as well as the employment stability of smaller firms who face difficulties<lb/> in expanding at home. All the above points must be explored further to understand more<lb/> fully the link between the trade and employment, at least in France.</p>
