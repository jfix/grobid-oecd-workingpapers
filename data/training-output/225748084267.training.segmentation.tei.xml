			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>Most OECD countries have endorsed as major policy objectives the reduction of inequalities in health <lb/>status and the principle of adequate or equal access to health care based on need. These policy objectives <lb/>require an evidence-based approach to measure progress. This paper assesses the availability and <lb/>comparability of selected indicators of inequality in health status and in health care access and use across <lb/>OECD countries, focussing on disparities among socioeconomic groups. These indicators are illustrated <lb/>using national or cross-national data sources to stratify populations by income, education or occupation <lb/>level. In each case, people in lower socioeconomic groups tend to have a higher rate of disease, disability <lb/>and death, use less preventive and specialist health services than expected on the basis of their need, and <lb/>for certain goods and services may be required to pay a proportionately higher share of their income to do <lb/>so. <lb/>Options for future OECD work in measuring health inequalities are provided through suggesting a small <lb/>set of indicators for development and inclusion in the OECD Health Data database. Some indicators <lb/>appear to be more advanced for international data collection, since comparable data are already being <lb/>collected in a routine fashion in most OECD countries. These include the indicators of inequalities in self-<lb/>rated health, self-rated disability, the extent of public health care coverage and private health insurance <lb/>coverage, and self-reported unmet medical and dental care needs. <lb/>Increased availability and comparability of data will improve the validity of cross-national comparisons of <lb/>socioeconomic inequalities in health status and health care access and use. Harmonisation of definitions <lb/>and collection instruments, and the greater use of data linkages in order to allow disaggregation by <lb/>socioeconomic status, will determine whether health inequalities can be routinely monitored across OECD <lb/>countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Les politiques de santé dans la plupart des pays de l&apos;OCDE ont comme objectifs majeurs la réduction des <lb/>inégalités en matière de santé et le respect du principe d&apos;un accès adéquat ou égal aux soins basé sur les <lb/>besoins. Des données robustes et fiables sont nécessaires pour mesurer l&apos;atteinte de ces objectifs politiques. <lb/>Ce document de travail évalue la disponibilité et la comparabilité de certains indicateurs de l&apos;inégalité de <lb/>l&apos;état de santé et de l&apos;accès et de l&apos;utilisation des soins dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, en se concentrant sur les <lb/>disparités selon les groupes socio-économiques. Ces indicateurs sont illustrés à partir de sources de <lb/>données nationales ou internationales qui permettent de distinguer les populations par niveau de revenu, <lb/>d&apos;éducation et d&apos;emploi. Dans tous les cas, les personnes appartenant à des groupes socio-économiques <lb/>désavantagés ont tendance à avoir des taux de morbidité, d&apos;incapacité et de mortalité plus élevés, à utiliser <lb/>moins de services préventifs et de soins spécialisés que ce à quoi on pourrait s&apos;attendre sur la base de leurs <lb/>besoins, et à payer une plus large part de leur revenu pour se procurer certains biens et services de santé. <lb/>Parmi les options de travaux futurs de l&apos;OCDE figure le développement d&apos;un petit ensemble d&apos;indicateurs <lb/>clés dans le domaine des inégalités en santé qui pourraient être intégrés dans la base de données Eco-Santé <lb/>OCDE. Certains indicateurs semblent plus avancés que d&apos;autres pour une collecte de données <lb/>internationales, puisque des données comparables sont déjà collectées régulièrement dans la plupart des <lb/>pays de l&apos;OCDE. Ces indicateurs comprennent les indicateurs d&apos;inégalité dans l&apos;état de santé général <lb/>perçu, l&apos;incapacité auto-déclarée, le degré de couverture des soins de santé publics et de l&apos;assurance <lb/>maladie privée, et les besoins de soins médicaux et dentaires non satisfaits. <lb/>Accroître la disponibilité et la comparabilité des données améliorerait la validité des comparaisons <lb/>internationales des inégalités socio-économiques de l&apos;état de santé et de l&apos;accès et de l&apos;utilisation des soins. <lb/>Pour que l&apos;évolution de ces inégalités soit mesurée de manière régulière dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, il faudra <lb/>harmoniser les définitions et les méthodes de collecte de données entre pays, et développer les possibilités <lb/>de lier différentes sources de données au niveau national afin de permettre une désagrégation selon le statut <lb/>socio-économique. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>1. <lb/>There have been substantial improvements in average levels of health outcomes in developed <lb/>countries over the past 50 years as demonstrated by the health status indicators in OECD Health Data, and <lb/>as summarised in Health at a Glance 2007. Life expectancy at birth has increased on average in OECD <lb/>countries from 68.5 years in 1960 to 78.6 years in 2005, infant mortality has declined from 29 deaths per <lb/>1 000 live births in 1970 to 5 in 2005, and ischaemic heart disease mortality rates have fallen from 178 per <lb/>100 000 population in 1980 to 96 in 2004. Premature mortality – years of life lost before age 70 – has been <lb/>cut by more than half on average since 1970 (OECD, 2007a). <lb/>2. <lb/>Differences in health continue to exist among populations, despite the gains of the past half <lb/>century. These health differences are apparent along many dimensions including age, gender, race or ethnic <lb/>group, geographic area and socioeconomic status. These differences, also known as variations or <lb/>differentials in health, are here referred to as health inequalities or disparities. Health inequalities which <lb/>are avoidable and are considered to be &quot; unfair &quot; according to some social norm which may vary across <lb/>countries, are here termed health inequities (Kawachi et al., 2002). <lb/>3. <lb/>Health inequality is a global issue, involving rich and poor countries alike. The importance of <lb/>health inequalities and their determinants, along with the unfairness and avoidability of health inequities, <lb/>has recently been underlined by the release of the Final Report of the World Health Organization&apos;s <lb/>Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH, 2008). Central to the Commission&apos;s work was <lb/>examining how health is distributed across the social spectrum and how the social conditions in which <lb/>people grow, live, work and age determine health. The Commission has emphasised that social <lb/>determinants of health produce widespread inequalities in health within and between societies. These <lb/>inequalities can be measured and described, and the evidence from this process can be used in producing <lb/>policies and programmes for change. <lb/>4. <lb/>The growing research interest in health inequalities has required an evidence base to be <lb/>developed, so that these inequalities can be better understood. Recent work on developing this evidence <lb/>base has followed two broad strands. The first examines social and economic determinants of health and <lb/>health inequalities among different groups in society, often defined by income, education, occupation or <lb/>some other measure of socioeconomic status. The second strand deals with low or differential use of health <lb/>services among different economic or other groups (Gwatkin, 2007). These two strands are explored in this <lb/>paper. <lb/>5. <lb/>The objective of this paper is twofold. First, to review the availability and comparability of <lb/>leading indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in health care access and use in OECD <lb/>countries, illustrated by examples using existing data. Second, to outline the steps required to improve the <lb/>availability and comparability of these leading indicators, in order to promote regular monitoring of <lb/>progress toward policy goals of reducing health inequalities and providing adequate or equal access to <lb/>care. 1 <lb/>1 <lb/>No indicators of socioeconomic disparities in health care quality are proposed in this paper, since the <lb/>development of a reliable and comparable set of health care quality indicators is still at an early stage under the <lb/></body>

			<body>6. <lb/>Table 1 summarises leading indicators that can be used to measure socioeconomic inequalities in <lb/>health within the two domains of health status and health care access and use, and indicates in broad terms <lb/>the data developmental work needed to improve the availability and comparability of data across OECD <lb/>countries. The paper expands on this summary by giving examples of how these indicators have been used <lb/>in research. Data availability and constraints are discussed in further detail, and conclusions are drawn on <lb/>the steps required in order to be able to collect such data in a comparable manner across OECD countries. <lb/>OECD&apos;s Health Care Quality Indicators (HCQI) project. Regarding inequalities in non-medical determinants <lb/>of health, the OECD Economics of Prevention project has begun to collect data on a number of determinants <lb/>of health (overweight and obesity, physical activity and nutrition) by level of education and other aspects of <lb/>socio-economic status, which may lead to an eventual extension of the regular OECD data collection for those <lb/>determinants that will be assessed as being most available and comparable across countries (OECD, 2009). <lb/>Regarding inequalities in health care financing, one relevant indicator is included in this paper – out-of-pocket <lb/>expenditure by income group. Determining progressivity in other types of financing mechanisms (general <lb/>taxation, social security contributions, and private health insurance) falls outside the scope of this paper. <lb/></body>

			<body>A FOCUS ON SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH <lb/>7. <lb/>Health inequalities exist along many demographic or social dimensions, including sex, age, racial <lb/>and ethnic group, geographic area and socioeconomic status. The usual starting point in measuring health <lb/>inequalities is to examine variations by sex and age, and OECD Health Data already reports these for <lb/>several health status measures. It indicates, for instance, that while a substantial gap in life expectancy <lb/>remains between men and women, the gap has narrowed in most OECD countries over the past twenty-five <lb/>years (OECD, 2007a). Mortality data also indicate that the distribution of ages at death among both men <lb/>and women varies widely across OECD countries (OECD, 2007b). As a next step, the focus is to review <lb/>the availability and comparability of measures of health disparities by socioeconomic status, including <lb/>their interactions with sex and age. <lb/>8. <lb/>In almost all countries and in different health systems, a socioeconomic gradient in health status <lb/>exists. As socioeconomic disadvantage increases, the circumstances in which people live and work are <lb/>more detrimental, there is an increase in the behaviours which worsen risks and so worsen health <lb/>outcomes, and an accompanying increase in morbidity and mortality. Populations may be divided into <lb/>groups characterised by social stratification, with individuals occupying higher or lower levels on a <lb/>hierarchy – their position on this hierarchy being their socioeconomic status (SES). Persons of lower SES <lb/>– typically those with a lower income, a lower level of education, or in a less prestigious occupational <lb/>group – tend to have a higher prevalence of illness and disease, can expect to live less years in good health, <lb/>have higher mortality rates and die at younger ages. The health burden attributable to socioeconomic <lb/>disadvantage is large. <lb/>9. <lb/>Socioeconomic inequalities are evident not only in population health status, but also in the access <lb/>to, and use of health care services. Poorer or less educated persons, despite having higher rates of illness, <lb/>disease and death, often have difficulties in locating appropriate specialist and preventive health services, <lb/>they use these services less, and for certain goods and services they may be required to pay a <lb/>proportionately higher share of their income to do so. <lb/>10. <lb/>Socioeconomic inequalities in health have been observed among different SES groups both <lb/>within and between countries, regardless of affluence or political or social systems. These inequalities have <lb/>not diminished in recent decades and in some cases have widened. This finding implies that inequalities are <lb/>deeply entrenched within the social structures of modern societies, and it provides a warning that <lb/>reductions in health disparities might be difficult to achieve in the short term (Mackenbach, 2006; <lb/>Mackenbach et al., 2007). <lb/>11. <lb/>Most national administrations have developed public policies and strategies to reduce <lb/>socioeconomic inequalities in health status (e.g. Acheson et al., 1998; Department of Health, 2003; AHRQ, <lb/>2008; Judge et al., 2006; Mackenbach &amp; EUROTHINE, 2007). Attempts to quantify the economic impact <lb/>of health inequalities have pointed to substantial gains that might be made through their reduction (Walker, <lb/>2005; Mackenbach et al., 2007). Many OECD countries have also endorsed as a major policy objective the <lb/>principle that access and use of health care should be based on need, and not the ability to pay (OECD, <lb/>2004a). Each of these policy objectives requires an evidence-based approach to measure progress. <lb/>12. <lb/>Identifying and measuring the burden of ill-health in socially disadvantaged sections of the <lb/>population provides great potential for improving the average health status of the whole population. Cross-<lb/></body>

			<body>country comparisons of socioeconomic inequalities in health status, and in the access and use of health <lb/>services can suggest areas for improvement for health administrations, and can provide possible policy <lb/>directions that aim at their reduction. The information gained from the measurement of inequalities gives <lb/>an impetus and focus for policy makers, as well as a yardstick by which to assess interventions and gauge <lb/>progress. <lb/>13. <lb/>For these reasons, the focus in this paper is on examining inequalities in health by socioeconomic <lb/>status. The universal prevalence of socioeconomic inequalities in health, and the importance of education, <lb/>income and occupation as determinants of health, makes a strong case for selection. This does not negate <lb/>the importance of other dimensions that are used to examine inequalities in health, such as geographic area <lb/>or race and ethnicity. In a number of OECD countries, racial and ethnic disparities in health remain a great <lb/>challenge (Kawachi et al., 2005; Mead et al., 2008). Health differences by geographic area, especially with <lb/>respect to access to care in remote areas, are also an important policy concern in many countries. A recent <lb/>OECD publication has reviewed a number of measures adopted in OECD countries to increase the supply <lb/>of doctors in remote and underserved areas (OECD, 2008). <lb/>Selection of leading indicators of health inequalities <lb/>14. <lb/>Table 1 presented a set of leading indicators that might be used to measure different <lb/>socioeconomic inequalities in health status, and in health care access and use. The selection of these <lb/>indicators has been based mainly on the criteria of relevancy, interpretability and feasibility (assessed in <lb/>terms of data availability and comparability). <lb/>15. <lb/>Indicators for measuring inequalities in health status have been grouped into three categories: <lb/>(i) indicators related to life expectancy and mortality, (ii) indicators related to morbidity and disability, and <lb/>(iii) composite indicators which include both mortality and morbidity information. <lb/>16. <lb/>Indicators for measuring inequalities in health care access and use here include: (i) health <lb/>insurance coverage, (ii) health care utilisation in relation to different services, (iii) measures of unmet care <lb/>needs, and (iv) out-of-pocket expenditure as a share of household income. A further indicator of &apos;effective <lb/>coverage of interventions&apos;, which was suggested recently as part of the refinement of the WHO framework <lb/>for health system performance assessment and which has been tested at the state level in Mexico, is <lb/>discussed in Annex 1. <lb/>Classifying social groups <lb/>17. <lb/>Socioeconomic status, the hierarchy used here to classify or stratify social groups, can be ordered <lb/>in numerous ways. The most common of these are by using educational level, occupational group and <lb/>income level or wealth. Indices comprised of more than one measure of SES may also be used. 2 A number <lb/>of international classifications of these stratifiers of SES can be used to facilitate cross-national <lb/>comparison. <lb/>• Educational level is typically measured by a hierarchical classification of the population by <lb/>completed education. Under the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) at <lb/>least four categories are identified, corresponding to elementary, lower secondary, upper<lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2 <lb/>Area-based indices, for example, are constructed from weighted variables collected through a census or other <lb/>survey, and allow for comparisons of social and economic conditions across a country. Persons living in areas <lb/>with lower scores are then associated with a lower average SES. The variables used differ across countries, so <lb/>the indices cannot be used for cross-country comparison. Examples include the Socioeconomic Indexes for <lb/>Areas (SEIFA), used in Australia, and the Socioeconomic Risk Index (SERI), used in Canada. <lb/></note>

			<body>secondary and tertiary. Part-time and vocational training are also included, but are difficult to fit <lb/>into the hierarchy. <lb/>• Occupation information is used to divide the population into a number of groups, with <lb/>distinctions often made between farmers, unskilled and skilled manual groups, self-employed, <lb/>and lower and upper non-manual groups. The International Standard Classification of <lb/>Occupations (ISCO) can be used to identify more specific categories of occupation. A person&apos;s <lb/>occupational group may vary throughout their working life, but it is usually determined by the <lb/>individual&apos;s current or last occupation.<lb/>• Income level can be classified according to individual income, or by the household equivalent <lb/>income – household income adjusted for size and composition, i.e. numbers of adults and <lb/>children. The entire population may then be classified into a number of groups of equal frequency <lb/>for analysis (e.g. five-groups: quintiles, or ten-groups: deciles). Income level may also be <lb/>analysed by using national poverty lines in order to determine SES.<lb/>Measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health <lb/>18. <lb/>There are many measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health, and they vary in complexity. <lb/>These measures differ in at least two ways: (i) whether they measure relative or absolute differences in <lb/>health, and (ii) whether the measurement technique is simple or sophisticated (Mackenbach &amp; Kunst, <lb/>1997). The choice of which is most appropriate depends largely on the objectives of the particular study <lb/>being undertaken. <lb/>19. <lb/>Relative or absolute differences – Measurement can be expressed as a relative difference (for <lb/>example, a rate ratio) or an absolute difference (for example, a difference in rates). Both are important, as <lb/>the theoretical example in Figure 1 illustrates. Assume two population groups A and B that have seen large <lb/>falls in mortality rates between two reference years 1970 and 2000, with the gap between the two also <lb/>narrowing. In 1970, the gap was 30 deaths per 100 000 population, coming down to only 10 in 2000. The <lb/>ratio of deaths per 100 000 population between groups A and B has increased from two in 1970 (60/30) to <lb/>three in 2000 (15/5). The mortality rate of both groups has improved and the absolute gap between them <lb/>has narrowed, however Group A&apos;s relative position has not improved; and in 2000 it was worse. The <lb/>illustration highlights that to gain a better understanding of the health status of the two groups, both <lb/>measurements should be considered. Absolute measures are important for decision-makers, especially <lb/>when goals in absolute terms have been set, because they allow a better appraisal of the magnitude of a <lb/>public health problem (Schneider et al., 2004). <lb/></body>

These measures of the &apos;gap&apos; between two population groups generally only considers health <lb/>inequalities between the two extreme groups, such as the highest and lowest income groups equivalent to <lb/>quintiles 1 and 5 if a population is divided into five equal groups. Gap measures emphasise the situation of <lb/>the most deprived group. The measures are often used for routine data collection and for monitoring over <lb/>longer time periods. However, they ignore information on the large proportion of the population that falls <lb/>in between, in quintiles 2, 3 and 4. <lb/>21. <lb/>A second group of more sophisticated regression-based measures summarise the magnitude of <lb/>inequalities across all population groups. These include summary indices such as the relative index of <lb/>inequality, and the concentration index, which is calculated in a similar fashion to the Lorenz curve and <lb/>Gini coefficient (Wagstaff et al., 1991; Mackenbach &amp; Kunst, 1997; Schneider et al., 2004; Harper &amp; <lb/>Lynch, 2005). These measures include information on both the magnitude of inequality and the total <lb/>population distribution of inequality, but at the expense of ease of interpretation and with greater <lb/>restrictions on the types of data which can be used. They often require that socioeconomic status be <lb/>measured on a quantifiable scale, and this might prove problematic for education-and occupation-based <lb/>indicators. <lb/>22. <lb/>An important consideration in choosing an appropriate measure of health inequality is the ease in <lb/>which they allow for routine data updating and ongoing monitoring. The choice of health inequality <lb/>measure is guided by restrictions imposed by available national or cross-national data, the requirements for <lb/>regular data provision and the assembling of a time series, the ease of interpretability and the resources <lb/>available for calculation of the indicator. Simpler measures such as rate ratios and rate differences would <lb/>be more feasible for a regular data collection such as the one carried out under OECD Health Data. In <lb/>using these simple measures, due care should be taken to present as much contextual information as <lb/>possible, such as providing both relative and absolute differences. <lb/>Data sources and challenges to improve comparability <lb/>23. <lb/>Data sources used to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in health should be nationally <lb/>representative, and must contain individual-level information which can be combined to form groups of <lb/></body>

			<body>similar socioeconomic status. Data should contain measures of age, sex, SES and health status or health <lb/>care access and use. To ensure robust cross-national comparisons, each of these measures must be <lb/>collected in a standard fashion across all countries. Some common data sources that are used include vital <lb/>statistics collections such as mortality registries, censuses, population-based surveys and health or social <lb/>security records (see Table 1). <lb/>24. <lb/>National mortality registries provide information on deaths by sex, age and cause, but in most <lb/>countries registries collect little or no information that can be used to determine socioeconomic status. This <lb/>means that data linkages need to be made between mortality registries and other comprehensive <lb/>information sources on the population (such as censuses), so as to be able to classify indicators of mortality <lb/>or life expectancy by some measure of socioeconomic status. In practice this only occurs in some <lb/>countries, and it is generally not undertaken for routine monitoring purposes. <lb/>25. <lb/>National health sector information such as hospital admission records rarely include information <lb/>on income, education, occupation or other socioeconomic measures. If place of residence is collected, this <lb/>can be used to assign individuals to an area-based SES measure. Information derived from these sources <lb/>usually needs to be linked to another source which provides information on SES. <lb/>26. <lb/>Health surveys are particularly well-suited to national-level analyses of inequalities in health <lb/>status (especially morbidity/disability) and in health care access and use. However, gathering comparable <lb/>data at an international level is limited by variations in the questions used to measure either health status, <lb/>or health care access and use, or socioeconomic status (see Annex 2). Limitations are also imposed by <lb/>differences in survey methodologies such as the reference population used and the mode of survey <lb/>administration. Further efforts to harmonise survey questions on health status, health care access and use, <lb/>and socioeconomic variables are required in order to improve the comparability of the data used to <lb/>measure socioeconomic inequalities in health. <lb/>27. <lb/>In Europe, cross-national health interview surveys (or health modules in broader surveys) provide <lb/>information on self-assessed health and disability, as well as on health care use and unmet care needs based <lb/>on a common set of questions. These surveys include: <lb/>• European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) – covers the entire adult <lb/>population aged 16 years and over in countries surveyed, except the population in institutions. <lb/>The survey contains questions that can be used to examine inequalities in four areas: self-rated <lb/>general health, chronic illnesses or conditions, activity limitation (disability) and unmet need for <lb/>medical or dental examination or treatment. Information is also collected on education and <lb/>income, allowing population stratification by SES. The survey is conducted annually. Data are <lb/>currently available for 15 European countries for the year 2004, and 27 countries for 2005 and <lb/>2006. Data tables are available at the Eurostat website (www.epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu). 3<lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 <lb/>EU-SILC is the successor to the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), which was a panel survey <lb/>conducted annually in most EU countries from 1994 to 2001.

			<body>• European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) – Eurostat has developed a number of modules to <lb/>measure a wide variety of indicators of health status, health care use and socioeconomic status in <lb/>a harmonised way. European Union countries are being encouraged to periodically (once every <lb/>five years) implement these modules in their national surveys. About two-thirds of the 27 EU <lb/>countries have committed to implement the survey between 2006 and 2010. The EHIS holds <lb/>potential for future analysis of health inequalities by socioeconomic status. 4<lb/>• Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) – covers populations aged 50 and <lb/>over, excluding the population in institutions, and contains questions on physical health, <lb/>behavioural risks, cognitive function, mental health and health care, as well as on income, <lb/>education and occupation. Eleven countries contributed to the 2004 baseline study, with 15 <lb/>participating in a second wave of data collection in 2006–07, and 16 due to participate in the third <lb/>wave in 2008–09. This survey is similar in many ways to the US Health and Retirement Survey <lb/>(HRS). Information is available at www.share-project.org.<lb/>28. <lb/>Beyond Europe, one of the main cross-national surveys that has been used to collect information <lb/>on socioeconomic inequalities in health is the Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey. <lb/>This survey is conducted annually by the Commonwealth Fund, and it has been used to carry out similar <lb/>analyses among the non-European and European OECD countries covered – seven in 2007, including <lb/>Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States <lb/>(Schoen et al., 2007). The survey contains questions on unmet health care needs and access problems, and <lb/>results from the 2001 and 2004 surveys were published with an analysis by respondent income <lb/>(www.commonwealthfund.org). The 2002–03 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health is another <lb/>survey that has been used to measure and compare socioeconomic disparities in health status, health care <lb/>use and unmet care needs between these two countries (Sanmartin et al., 2004). <lb/>4 <lb/>The Eurostat website also contains data from national health interview surveys that were carried out between <lb/>1999 and 2003 in most EU Member States and which were harmonised to the extents possible. The data <lb/>include survey results regarding questions on self-rated health, longstanding illness and disability (activity <lb/>restriction), health service use and preventative screening, stratified by educational level <lb/>(www.epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu). <lb/></body>

			<body>1. INDICATORS OF INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH STATUS <lb/>29. <lb/>Kunst and Mackenbach (1995) have defined socioeconomic inequalities in health status as <lb/> &quot; Differences in the prevalence or incidence of health problems between individual people <lb/>of higher or lower socioeconomic status &quot; <lb/>30. <lb/>In using this definition it should be emphasised that although individuals are referred to, analyses <lb/>of socioeconomic inequalities in health usually consider groups of individuals, linked by a common SES. <lb/>Within such a group, the individuals comprising it will differ in their health status; however taken as a <lb/>whole, people with lower SES tend to have higher morbidity and mortality rates. <lb/>1.1 Mortality-based indicators <lb/>31. <lb/>Indicators such as life expectancy, cause-specific and total mortality rates and infant mortality are <lb/>commonly used to monitor population health status. Data by sex and age are widely available and <lb/>relatively precise, but data linked to other measures of SES are scarcer. <lb/>Life expectancy <lb/>32. <lb/>Life expectancy is a measure of how long a person might expect to live if the mortality patterns <lb/>occurring in a particular year remained unchanged over a lifetime. Life expectancy measures the length of <lb/>life, but not its quality. The measures are derived from life tables, which are commonly calculated using <lb/>mortality data held in registries, although surveys and censuses may also be used. To calculate life <lb/>expectancies for different socioeconomic groups, mortality data for individuals must be &apos;linked&apos; to another <lb/>data set which includes information on the individuals&apos; SES, such as a census. <lb/>33. <lb/>In 2006, Eurostat established a Task Force to develop indicators of life expectancy by socio-<lb/>economic status for EU countries. The Task Force&apos;s preferred approach is to link death certificates with <lb/>census information. The next census in 2011 provides an opportunity to put in place or refine the statistical <lb/>systems needed for the production of harmonised mortality data by socio-economic status. However, the <lb/>requirement for data linkage with census information means that this indicator might not be suited for <lb/>regular monitoring, since censuses are infrequent. But because life expectancies tend to increase slowly in <lb/>developed countries, except in certain circumstances, monitoring may only be necessary at 5-yearly <lb/>intervals or longer. <lb/>34. <lb/>The available evidence shows that life expectancy is shorter among persons from lower <lb/>socioeconomic groups, reflecting group differences in the risk of dying. A number of studies have <lb/>observed differences in life expectancy at birth between lowest and highest socio-economic groups, in the <lb/>order of four to six years among men and two to four years among women, but larger differences may also <lb/>be observed (Mackenbach, 2006; Singh &amp; Siahpush, 2006; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2008; <lb/>Whitehouse &amp; Zaidi, 2008). <lb/>35. <lb/>Figure 2 provides an illustration of the link between socioeconomic inequality and life <lb/>expectancy. Men and women working in the least skilled occupations in England and Wales can expect to <lb/>live seven years less than persons working in professional occupations. The effect is observed not only <lb/>between the least and most skilled; the social gradient is evident across all levels of society, so that in this <lb/>example skilled workers have two to three years lower life expectancy than those in professional <lb/>occupations. <lb/></body>

			<body>37. <lb/>Analyses stratifying populations by education give the same picture (Figure 4). The life <lb/>expectancy of better-educated men and women in the Russian Federation increased substantially between <lb/>1980 and 2001, while it declined for the least-educated. In 1980, life expectancy at age 20 for university-<lb/>educated men was three years greater than for men with elementary education only; by 2001 this difference <lb/>had increased to 11 years. Similar patterns were seen in women (Murphy et al., 2006). A widening in life <lb/>expectancy inequalities between those with lower and higher socioeconomic status scores has also been <lb/>observed in Finland around this time, with differences in deaths from cardiovascular diseases and alcohol-<lb/>related conditions together accounting for most of the increase in health inequalities in that country <lb/>(Mackenbach, 2006). <lb/>38. <lb/>The monitoring of socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy is part of a Programme for <lb/>Action for the national health inequalities strategy in England (Department of Health, 2008). A target for <lb/>life expectancy has been set: by 2010 to reduce the gap between the fifth of areas with the worst health and <lb/>deprivation indicators and the population as a whole, by at least 10%. <lb/>Figure 4: Trends in male and female life expectancy at age 20, by educational attainment, Russian Federation, <lb/>1980-2001 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>50 <lb/>55 <lb/>60 <lb/>1980 <lb/>1985 <lb/>1990 <lb/>1995 <lb/>2000 <lb/>Years <lb/>Year <lb/>Women <lb/>Men <lb/>University <lb/>Intermediate <lb/>Elementary <lb/>Source: Murphy et al., 2006 <lb/>Total mortality <lb/>39. <lb/>Important differences in mortality rates are found between different socioeconomic groups. Rates <lb/>of mortality are higher among persons with lower levels of education or income, or in lower occupational <lb/>classes, and these differential rates are evident for most major causes of death. These inequalities in <lb/>mortality exist across all age groups and both sexes, although they tend to be smaller among women than <lb/>men (Mackenbach, 2006). <lb/>40. <lb/>Vital statistics registries are the starting point for examining socioeconomic inequalities in <lb/>mortality. Information on income, education or occupation is needed to stratify populations by SES, and <lb/>this is usually obtained through linking mortality records to a census or other survey. In some countries, <lb/>relevant information such as the usual occupation of the deceased is collected following death, and is <lb/>included on death certificates. This information can be used to stratify populations by SES, if available <lb/>electronically. <lb/></body>

			<body>41. <lb/>Measuring SES using levels of income, education or occupation is not straightforward, and due <lb/>care needs to be taken in ensuring that cross-national comparisons are valid through comparing similar <lb/>categories. The requirement for data linkage to censuses or other surveys adds difficulty to using this <lb/>indicator for routine monitoring purposes, since censuses are infrequent. <lb/>42. <lb/>Data on total mortality rate ratios by education, income and occupation are available for most <lb/>OECD countries, albeit on an irregular basis (see, for example, Mackenbach et al., 2008; Fukuda et al., <lb/>2007; Khang et al., 2004). Long time series of mortality data with socioeconomic information covering <lb/>large national samples are only available for a limited number of countries. <lb/>43. <lb/>Figure 5 presents information on deaths among mostly middle-aged men and women in a number <lb/>of European countries. Mortality data were linked to censuses carried out during the early-to-mid 1990s in <lb/>order to obtain information on the highest level of completed education. Age-standardised death rates and <lb/>rate ratios were calculated for educational groups, with a rate ratio of 1.0 indicating no difference between <lb/>lower and higher educated persons. Mortality rates among less educated persons are markedly higher. In <lb/>European countries, less educated persons have a 20–50% excess risk of dying than more educated <lb/>persons, and in some countries mortality rates are more than double. Inequalities are larger for men, except <lb/>in Spain (Mackenbach, 2006). <lb/>Figure 5: Ratio of total mortality rates between less and more educated people, selected EU countries, 1990s <lb/>or nearest available year <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.2 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>Italy (1991-1996) <lb/>Spain (1992-1996) <lb/>Denmark (1991-1995) <lb/>France (1990-1994) <lb/>Finland (1991-1995) <lb/>Switzerland (1991-1995) <lb/>Belgium (1991-1995) <lb/>England and Wales (1991-1996) <lb/>Norway (1990-1995) <lb/>Austria (1991-1992) <lb/>OECD-14 <lb/>Czech Republic (end 1990s) <lb/>Netherlands (1991-1997) <lb/>Hungary (2002) <lb/>Poland (1988-89) <lb/>Men Women <lb/>Source: Mackenbach, 2006 <lb/></body>

			<body>44. <lb/>A further example from Korea shows inequalities in mortality among men, according to their <lb/>highest level of completed education (Figure 6). Men with the least education had mortality rates four to <lb/>five times higher the most educated group. Although mortality rates fell for all groups over the ten-year <lb/>period 1990–1991 to 2000–2001, the relative level of socioeconomic inequality in mortality appeared to be <lb/>unchanged (Khang et al., 2004). <lb/>Figure 6: Mortality rate ratios by highest level of education, Korean men aged 30–59, 1990–1991 to 2000–2001 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>1990-1991 <lb/>1995-1996 <lb/>2000-2001 <lb/>Rate ratio (95% CI) <lb/>Middle or high school <lb/>Elementary or less <lb/>Note: College education or higher = 1.0. <lb/>Source: Khang et al., 2004 <lb/>Infant mortality <lb/>45. <lb/>Infant mortality is a frequently-used indicator of population health and social progress. All <lb/>OECD countries have seen remarkable progress in reducing infant mortality in recent decades, with an <lb/>average reduction of 80% across the 30 countries between 1970 and 2005 (OECD, 2007a). Yet widespread <lb/>inequalities in infant mortality rates persist within countries. Figure 7 provides an illustration, and shows <lb/>infant mortality rates for urban neighbourhoods in Canada by quintiles of wealth. Rates declined rapidly <lb/>for all neighbourhoods between 1971 and 1996, although they remain highest among the poorest <lb/>neighbourhoods. Inequalities narrowed somewhat over the time period, in that the rate ratio of the richest <lb/>and poorest neighbourhoods (Q1/Q5) declined from 2.0 in 1971 to 1.7 in 1996, although progress slowed <lb/>after 1991. <lb/></body>

Infant mortality declined in all county income <lb/>quintiles, and both absolute and relative inequalities shrank between 1966 and 1980; relative health <lb/>inequalities widened thereafter, with little change in the magnitude of absolute differences. <lb/>47. <lb/>A number of countries use infant mortality to monitor health inequality targets. The United <lb/>Kingdom Department of Health target is to reduce the gap in infant mortality in England and Wales <lb/>between the &apos;routine and manual&apos; occupation group and the population as a whole to 10% by 2010 <lb/>(Department of Health, 2007). The infant mortality rate among the routine and manual group was 17% <lb/>higher than the total population in 2004–06, compared with 19% higher in 2002–04, and 13% higher in the <lb/>baseline year 1997–99. While the gap has decreased in recent years, further progress will be needed to <lb/>reach the 10% target by 2010. <lb/>48. <lb/>The same data sources used for the analysis of total or cause-specific mortality allow for the <lb/>examination of socioeconomic inequalities among particular age groups, including infants. The need for <lb/>age-standardisation of data is avoided, but the challenge of linking data sources containing information on <lb/>mortality and SES remains. Determining the SES of an infant is usually through ascertaining the status of a <lb/>parent, or of the geographic area of residence of the household. <lb/>1.2 Morbidity-based indicators <lb/>49. <lb/>Other measures beyond those based on mortality are required for monitoring inequalities in <lb/>population health status. As life expectancy increases and chronic disease prevalence continues to rise, <lb/>policy makers need additional information on the non-fatal consequences of disease and severity of health <lb/>conditions. A number of morbidity-based indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health are available, <lb/>generally utilising information on self-reported health, illness or activity limitation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Self-reported health <lb/>50. <lb/>Questions on self-reported health form part of most national and cross-national health surveys, <lb/>and can be used to gauge levels and distributions in population health status. These surveys include a <lb/>question of the form: &quot; How is your health status in general? Very good, good, fair, bad or very bad &quot; . <lb/>Although subjective in nature, within particular national cultures the measure correlates well with other <lb/>measures of health status, and it has been found to be useful in predicting future health problems and health <lb/>service use (Miilunpalo et al., 1997). This question, or more elaborate sets of questions on self-reported <lb/>health, can also be used in the calculation of healthy life expectancies and other summary measures of <lb/>health (see next section). It remains one of the most widely available indicators of health inequalities by <lb/>SES. <lb/>51. <lb/>The main sources of information on self-reported health are national, or cross-national health <lb/>interview surveys. In European countries, both EU-SILC and EHIS collect information on self-reported <lb/>health, and the available data allow a stratification of the population either by income or education. In <lb/>order to promote valid international comparisons, the methods and instruments – including the survey <lb/>questions, response categories and the populations surveyed – must be standard (see Annex 2). For the <lb/>purpose of measuring disparities in each country, populations within countries must also share common <lb/>cultural standards and perceptions of good health. For these reasons, caution is required when making <lb/>cross-country comparisons using this indicator. A number of cross-national studies of self-reported health <lb/>by SES are available (Sanmartin et al., 2004; NOMESCO, 2004; Mackenbach, 2006). <lb/>52. <lb/>When self-reported health is analysed by SES groupings, important differentials in population <lb/>health status are revealed. Among Nordic countries, for example, a series of national surveys conducted in <lb/>2000–2002 found that greater proportions of persons with low education report poorer health, and more so <lb/>in Finland than Sweden, Norway or Denmark (Figure 8). Women tended to report poorer health than men, <lb/>except in Finland. <lb/>Figure 8: Percentage of people reporting poor health, by education and gender, Nordic countries, 2000–2002 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>DNK SWE FIN NOR <lb/>DNK SWE FIN NOR <lb/>DNK SWE FIN NOR <lb/>A maximum of 9 years education <lb/>10–12 years education <lb/>At least 13 years education <lb/>% reporting poor <lb/>health <lb/>Men Women <lb/>Source: NOMESCO, 2004 <lb/></body>

			<body>53. <lb/>These findings are repeated in many countries – people in lower socioeconomic groups report <lb/>poorer health. But the extent of inequality varies from country to country, with differing rates of inequality <lb/>between income groups reporting &apos;very bad&apos; or &apos;bad&apos; health, for example (Figure 9). Within EU countries, <lb/>reported poor health among the population as a whole is most prevalent in Eastern European countries <lb/>(Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Poland), along with Portugal and Spain; however, as <lb/>previously discussed, different populations do not always share common standards and perceptions of good <lb/>health. Inequalities within countries between low and high income groups are greater in Belgium, Iceland, <lb/>Ireland and the United Kingdom, although in the latter three countries, the proportion of persons reporting <lb/>poorer health is low. <lb/>Figure 9: Inequalities in persons reporting their health as &apos;very bad&apos;, by income quintile and rate ratio, selected <lb/>EU countries, 2006 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Sweden <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Austria <lb/>Greece <lb/>Italy <lb/>France <lb/>Germany <lb/>Norway <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Finland <lb/>Poland <lb/>Spain <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Slovak Republic <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Per cent <lb/>Lowest income quintile <lb/>Highest income quintile <lb/>0.0 <lb/>5.0 <lb/>10.0 <lb/>15.0 <lb/>Rate ratio <lb/>Source: EU-SILC <lb/>54. <lb/>The situation is no different in non-European countries, with numerous studies confirming poorer <lb/>self-rated health among persons from lower socioeconomic groups. There are differences, however, in the <lb/>specific measure of SES used in the published data that are readily available, with some countries such as <lb/>Australia and New Zealand using a Disadvantage or Deprivation Index, while other countries use <lb/>education or income levels (Table 2). Such differences hamper cross-country comparisons with data <lb/>derived from EU-SILC. <lb/>55. <lb/>Inequalities in self-reported morbidity are substantial, and persons with lower socio-economic <lb/>status have higher morbidity rates not only in self-reported health, but also in chronic conditions and <lb/>disability. The inequalities are persistent, although as yet it is unclear whether gaps are widening over time <lb/>(Mackenbach, 2006). <lb/></body>

Self-reported disability reflects the non-fatal consequences of disease and impairment, and <lb/>can provide some indication of the need for medical and social services. Information on self-reported <lb/>disability may also be used to calculate various measures of healthy life expectancy (see next section). <lb/>57. <lb/>Progress towards a universal concept and definition of disability was assisted by the adoption of <lb/>the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by the World Health <lb/>Organization in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The ICF uses the term &apos;disability&apos; to broadly cover any or all of the <lb/>following components: impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction, as influenced by <lb/>environmental factors 5 . A number of cross-national initiatives (notably the Budapest Initiative on Health <lb/>Status Measures, and the UN Washington City Group on Disability Statistics) have in recent years sought <lb/>to develop a small set of standard questions on health status and disability that could be recommended for <lb/>use in (cross-) national surveys or censuses. <lb/>58. <lb/>Currently, measures of self-reported disability are available for most OECD countries, although <lb/>the survey instruments vary across countries, thereby limiting comparability (see Annex 2). In Europe, the <lb/>EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) includes one general question on <lb/>disability. The health status module in the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) also recommends that <lb/>EU countries use this question, along with a more elaborate set of questions, to measure different types of <lb/>disabilities. Other countries include questions on disability in general health or specialised surveys, <lb/>5 <lb/>Impairments are &quot; problems in body function or structure such as significant deviation or loss &quot; . Activity <lb/>limitations are &quot; difficulties an individual may have in executing activities &quot; . Participation restrictions are <lb/> &quot; problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations &quot; . Environmental factors &quot; make up <lb/>the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives &quot; (WHO, 2001). <lb/></body>

			<body>although the question might measure a different type of disability. Additional demographic and other <lb/>information collected in these surveys allow for stratification of respondents by SES groups. <lb/>59. <lb/>Disability rates tend to be higher among socioeconomically disadvantaged persons. Results from <lb/>the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2003 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, for example, <lb/>indicate that self-reported disability is three to four times more prevalent in the lowest income quintile, <lb/>compared with the highest income quintile (Table 3). This finding is related to people in lower <lb/>socioeconomic groups having higher frequencies of physical and mental health problems. <lb/>Table 3: Self-reported disability status <lb/>(a) by household income, persons aged 15 years and over, Australia, <lb/>2003 <lb/>Equivalised gross household income quintiles <lb/>All reported disabilities (%) <lb/>Lowest quintile <lb/>29.4 <lb/>Second quintile <lb/>19.2 <lb/>Third quintile <lb/>12.4 <lb/>Fourth quintile <lb/>9.5 <lb/>Highest quintile <lb/>8.3 <lb/>Not applicable or not known <lb/>21.3 <lb/>Total <lb/>100.0 <lb/>(a) In this survey a person has a disability if they report that they have a limitation, restriction or impairment, which has lasted, or is <lb/>likely to last, for at least six months and restricts everyday activities. <lb/>Source: ABS, 2004 <lb/>60. <lb/>A large body of evidence reports that higher educational levels are associated with lower levels <lb/>of disability (Mackenbach, 2006; Lafortune et al., 2007). Higher educational levels are often accompanied <lb/>by higher incomes and standards of living, a lower risk of work-related injury or ill-health, and healthier <lb/>behaviours such as a balanced diet and a lower prevalence of smoking and risk alcohol drinking. Across 19 <lb/>OECD countries in the late 1990s, the average disability prevalence rate among groups with lower <lb/>educational attainment was 19%, compared with 11% among the better educated (OECD, 2003). 6 <lb/>1.3 Summary measures of population health <lb/>61. <lb/>Increasingly, a variety of health information is needed to complement conventional measures of <lb/>life expectancy, and to determine whether ageing populations are living longer lives free of disability or ill <lb/>health. Summary measures of population health assist in this by combining information on both mortality <lb/>and morbidity, so as to better monitor population health and forecast future health care needs. These <lb/>measures provide information on the number of remaining years a person might expect to live, and on their <lb/>health status during those years. <lb/>62. <lb/>Several measures have been developed, each seeking to calculate the average expectation of <lb/>years of life in equivalent good health, after adjusting for years lived with some form of illness or <lb/>disability. Summary measures of population health include Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE), <lb/></body>

			<body>Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). These measures <lb/>may also be calculated for different socioeconomic groups within a population. <lb/>63. <lb/>The measures are relatively easy to interpret, being based on recognisable concepts of illness, <lb/>disability and mortality. Their calculation is more complex, since they rely on at least two data sources – a <lb/>measure of morbidity or disability, usually a health or household interview survey, and a measure of <lb/>mortality, often a census cohort linked to a mortality registry. One of these sources must also contain <lb/>information on socioeconomic status, if summary measures by SES group are to be calculated. <lb/>64. <lb/>Regular monitoring of summary measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health within <lb/>countries is still uncommon. Cross-national comparisons of summary measures are further complicated by <lb/>needing to ensure that the concepts and methods used in data sources are standard across countries. In <lb/>recent years, international organisations such as Eurostat and the World Health Organization have made <lb/>efforts to improve understandings and applications of concepts and methods, and to harmonise summary <lb/>measures of population health, although it remains a challenge to disaggregate them by SES. <lb/>Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) <lb/>65. <lb/>The Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) measure aims to quantify the remaining years a <lb/>person of a certain age can expect to live without disability. The measure requires mortality data as for a <lb/>standard life table, and estimates of the prevalence of disability among population age groups, usually as <lb/>self-reported in health surveys. The valuation of self-reported disability status is based on a simple <lb/>dichotomous value of 0 (if people report being moderately or severely disabled, depending on the cut-off <lb/>point) or 1 (if they report not being disabled). To calculate DFLE by SES, one of the data sources must <lb/>also contain information on income, education or occupation. <lb/>66. <lb/>DFLE has been adopted as a European Structural Indicator, and it is calculated and reported by <lb/>Eurostat on a regular basis, using the EU-SILC as the source for the disability measure 7 . Work continues to <lb/>develop the measure, with DG-SANCO and Eurostat establishing an EU Task Force on Health <lb/>Expectancies in 2006. The strategic plan of the Task Force includes improving current Healthy Life Year <lb/>(i.e. DFLE) estimates, improving international comparability, and calculating Healthy Life Years for SES <lb/>groups (EU Task Force on Health Expectancies, 2007). This latter goal depends crucially, however, on <lb/>achieving progress in calculating life expectancy by SES in a consistent way in EU countries. <lb/>67. <lb/>A number of non-European countries have also calculated DFLE, using self-reported disability <lb/>questions from their own national health or disability surveys. The US National Centre for Health Statistics <lb/>currently uses three measures of Years of Healthy Life, including DFLE, to monitor the US &apos;Healthy <lb/>People 2010&apos; public health programme. Questions and response categories often differ across countries and <lb/>surveys, and these will require standardisation if they are to be used for cross-national comparison. For <lb/>instance, the question on disability used by the US National Center for Health Statistics (taken from the <lb/>National Health Interview Survey) includes only two response categories (Yes, limited in activities or No, <lb/>not limited), while the disability question in EU SILC includes three responses (Yes, severely limited; Yes, <lb/>limited but not severely; No, not limited). There are also differences in the wording of the question. These <lb/>differences can be expected to affect the comparability of overall prevalence rates of disability in the <lb/>population, however, they probably have less impact if the focus is on examining the distribution of <lb/>disability by SES within each country. <lb/>7 <lb/>In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council invited the European Commission to present an annual report on <lb/>progress achieved in the areas of employment, innovation, economic reform, social cohesion and the <lb/>environment. &apos;Structural Indicators&apos; allows quantitative evaluation and comparison of performances of the <lb/>Member States in these areas. The DFLE Structural Indicator is also known as &apos;Healthy Life Years&apos;. <lb/></body>

SES was measured by calculating material <lb/>deprivation deciles, based on area of residence information from the 1991 Census. Females born during <lb/>1996–1999 could expect to live 60 years free of disability on average, but with wide variation, from 55 <lb/>years in most deprived areas to 65 years in least deprived areas. <lb/>Figure 10: LE and DFLE at birth by deprivation deciles, females, England, 1996–1999 <lb/>65 <lb/>63 <lb/>64 <lb/>62 <lb/>61 <lb/>59 <lb/>59 <lb/>58 <lb/>57 <lb/>55 <lb/>17 <lb/>18 <lb/>17 <lb/>19 <lb/>19 <lb/>21 <lb/>21 <lb/>21 <lb/>22 <lb/>24 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/>9 <lb/>1 0 <lb/>Least d ep rived <lb/>Mo st d ep rived <lb/>Years of life <lb/>Deciles <lb/>Disability-free <lb/>With disability <lb/>Source: Bajekal, 2005 <lb/>Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) <lb/>69. <lb/>Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) measures the number of years that an individual can <lb/>expect to live in full health if current morbidity and mortality conditions prevail. It &apos;adjusts&apos; life <lb/>expectancy by weighing years of life lived in good health higher than years lived in poor health. The <lb/>weighing of years of life depends on the valuation of different health conditions, with values ranging from <lb/>0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents full health. <lb/>70. <lb/>Information required to calculate HALE includes a life table in order to calculate life <lb/>expectancies, a population health survey which describes the health status of the population, and a <lb/>valuation of the different health conditions. HALE may be calculated for socioeconomic groups if both life <lb/>expectancy and health status measures can be linked to the same SES measure. Valid cross-country <lb/>comparisons are also subject to the same constraint. <lb/>71. <lb/>HALE has been calculated for the 2001 Canadian population (Figure 11), using the Health Utility <lb/>Index to describe and value health status. In this example, life expectancy at birth and at age 65 are <lb/>presented for both males and females in different income groups. Both sexes in lower income groups can <lb/>expect to live less years in full health. At birth, Canadian males in the lowest income group had a HALE <lb/>almost five years lower than that for males in the highest income group; among females, HALE was three <lb/>years lower (Health Canada, 2006). <lb/></body>

The DALY is a &apos;health gap&apos; measure that extends the <lb/>concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) to include equivalent years of &apos;healthy&apos; <lb/>life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability (YLD). DALYs thus represent the sum of <lb/>YLL and YLD, with one DALY representing the loss of one year of equivalent full health (Murray et al., <lb/>2002). <lb/>73. <lb/>The calculation of DALYs requires a number of data sources. The YLL component is derived <lb/>from information on numbers of deaths, and life expectancies at various ages, as sourced from life tables <lb/>and mortality registers. The YLD component requires data on disease incidence and duration until <lb/>remission or death, as well as a weight factor reflecting disease severity on a scale from 0 (perfect health) <lb/>to 1 (death). It can be derived from various sources, including disease registers, hospital administrative <lb/>data or health interview surveys. <lb/>74. <lb/>DALYs have been used as summary measures of population health by the World Health <lb/>Organization in their Global Burden of Disease Study and World Health Reports (Lopez et al., 2006), <lb/>although data were not disaggregated by SES groups. Several countries have produced their own Burden of <lb/>Disease reports, using DALYs to monitor health inequalities (e.g. Begg et al., 2007 for Australia). <lb/>75. <lb/>DALYs have been calculated for the Australian population by SES, using 2003 mortality and <lb/>morbidity/disability data. Not surprisingly, populations in areas with lower SES experienced proportionally <lb/>higher burdens of disease in terms of disability and mortality than populations in areas with higher SES <lb/>(Figure 12). The difference exceeded 30% between the most and least disadvantaged populations (Begg et <lb/>al., 2007). <lb/></body>

			<body>2. INDICATORS OF INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND USE <lb/>76. <lb/>Ensuring adequate access to essential health services on the basis of individual need is a health <lb/>policy goal in all OECD countries. Most countries further endorse the principle of &apos;equal access to equal <lb/>care for equal need&apos;. Almost all OECD countries have introduced universal health insurance coverage to <lb/>ensure financial access to a core set of health services (OECD, 2007a). Despite this, inequalities in health <lb/>care access and use remain for different reasons, and these may act to either mitigate or exacerbate <lb/>inequalities in health status. <lb/>77. <lb/>Health care access means people&apos;s ability to obtain appropriate health care services in a timely <lb/>fashion and without obstacle. Some common barriers to access include financial reasons, a lack of health <lb/>care providers, excessive travelling distance to providers, and excessive waiting time to see providers. <lb/>Health care use relates to people&apos;s actual utilisation of different types of services (Academy Health, 2004). <lb/>In determining inequities in health service utilisation, an adjustment to actual utilisation rates is often <lb/>needed in order to compensate for people&apos;s differing needs for care, using available information such as <lb/>their self assessed health status. <lb/>78. <lb/>Measurement of inequalities in access and use may simply be in terms of comparing rates of <lb/>unmet care or rates of service utilisation between low and high income groups. It may also be measured <lb/>using more complex indices that seek to account for differences across the whole population, and not just <lb/>between highest and lowest socioeconomic groups. <lb/>79. <lb/>Indicators that are commonly used to gauge equity in health care access and use include the <lb/>extent of public and private health insurance coverage across SES groups, the receipt or use of different <lb/>types of health services (ideally adjusted for need, where applicable), the reporting of unmet care needs for <lb/>various reasons, and the proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure in relation to household income or <lb/>consumption. A discussion of each of these follows. <lb/>2.1 Health insurance coverage <lb/>80. <lb/>One potential barrier to receiving appropriate health care is inadequate insurance coverage. <lb/>Health insurance coverage provides financial security against the costs of unexpected illness and assists <lb/>access to innovative treatments and preventative services. Most OECD countries have achieved universal <lb/>coverage of health care costs for at least a core set of services, sometimes through combinations of public <lb/>and private health insurance. Three countries that have not yet attained universal coverage are Mexico, <lb/>Turkey and the United States (OECD, 2007a) (Figure 13). <lb/></body>

The uninsured are more likely to have poorer <lb/>health status and die early. They report more problems in getting care, are diagnosed at later disease stages <lb/>and receive less therapeutic care. The uninsured are sicker when hospitalised and are more likely to die <lb/>during their hospital stay. In the United States, the problem of persistent uninsurance is seen as a major <lb/>barrier to receiving health care, and, more broadly, to reducing health inequalities (AHRQ, 2008). <lb/></body>

It is important to look at basic health insurance <lb/>coverage in conjunction with other types of private health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket spending <lb/>for health services (see next section on this latter topic). <lb/>83. <lb/>Private health insurance plays a number of roles in OECD health systems, either as a primary or <lb/>supplementary source of insurance coverage. Complementary or duplicate coverage is also possible <lb/>(OECD, 2004c). In a number of countries, private health insurance coverage varies by SES. In Australia, <lb/>23% of persons in the lowest income quintile in 2004–05 had private health insurance, compared with 76% <lb/>of those in the highest income quintile (ABS, 2006). In France, coverage of complementary health <lb/>insurance is unequal across income groups, and poorer households spend proportionally more of their <lb/>incomes to purchase it (10.3% of income in the lowest income quintile vs. 2.9% in the highest) (Kambia-<lb/>Chopin et al., 2008). Private health insurance need not necessarily create access inequities, however, <lb/>especially if voluntary schemes complement what are otherwise fairly equitable distributions of care <lb/>(OECD, 2004b). <lb/>84. <lb/>OECD Health Data already collects data on public and private health insurance coverage, <lb/>although not disaggregated by income group. In countries that do not have universal health insurance <lb/>coverage, data on public and/or private health insurance coverage by SES may be collected through health <lb/>interview or household surveys. <lb/>2.2 Out-of-pocket expenditure <lb/>85. <lb/>Measuring the financial burden of out-of-pocket spending on households is important, since these <lb/>burdens can create barriers to health care access and/or use. Households having difficulties paying medical <lb/>bills may delay or forgo needed health care (Hoffman et al., 2005; May &amp; Cunningham, 2004, cited in <lb/>Banthin et al., 2008). <lb/></body>

			<body>86. <lb/>In contrast to publicly-funded care, out-of-pocket payments are distributed based on the use of <lb/>care, and not on the ability to pay. If the financing of health care becomes more dependent on out-of-<lb/>pocket payments, its burden is, in theory, shifted towards those who use the services more (possibly from <lb/>rich to poor, if health care needs are higher for the low income groups). In practice, many countries have <lb/>put in place exemptions and caps to out-of-pocket payments for lower income groups to protect health care <lb/>access. <lb/>87. <lb/>The burden of out-of-pocket health spending on households can be measured either by its share <lb/>of total household income or its share of total household consumption. Data presently collected under <lb/>OECD Health Data show that the average share of out-of-pocket spending in household consumption <lb/>varies considerably across OECD countries in 2006, representing less than 2% of total household <lb/>consumption in countries such as the Netherlands and France, while such spending accounted for more <lb/>than 6% of total household consumption in Switzerland and Greece. The United States, with almost 3% of <lb/>consumption being spent on out-of-pocket health services, is close to the average. <lb/>88. <lb/>The distribution of spending across the population can vary considerably, depending on whether <lb/>such spending is affected by income, service use, type of coverage, or other factors. For instance, an <lb/>analysis of data from the US Medical Expenditure Survey found that 28% of Americans living in a poor <lb/>family (defined as a family income below the federal poverty level) were spending more than 10% of their <lb/>after-tax family income for health services and health insurance premiums in 2004, compared with 10% of <lb/>Americans living in a high income family (Banthin et al., 2008). 8 <lb/>89. <lb/>A 2007 Commonwealth Fund survey found that – in addition to almost 50 million people who <lb/>were uninsured in the US – an estimated 25 million people aged 19–64 (or 14% of all adults) were <lb/>underinsured, a 60% increase since 2003. Persons were defined as &apos;underinsured&apos; if they experienced at <lb/>least one of the three indicators of financial expenditure exposure relative to income: (1) out-of-pocket <lb/>medical expenses for care amounted to 10% of income or more, (ii) among low-income adults (below <lb/>200% of the federal poverty level), medical expenses amounted to at least 5% of income, or <lb/>(iii) deductibles equalled or exceeded 5% of income. Underinsurance varied by SES group, from 7% of <lb/>adults earning USD 100 000 or more, to 26% of adults earning less than USD 20 000 per annum. In total, <lb/>42% of US adults were found to be underinsured or uninsured, reporting high levels of access problems <lb/>and financial stress (Schoen et al., 2008). <lb/>90. <lb/>A small proportion of households in OECD countries face &quot; catastrophic &quot; health expenditure each <lb/>year, often defined as payments for health services exceeding 40% of their disposable income after <lb/>subsistence needs are met. In Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United States, rates of catastrophic <lb/>spending exceed 0.5% (Xu et al., 2007). The incidence of financial catastrophe in the lowest income <lb/>quintile would be expected to exceed that in higher quintiles; however the imposition of user fees may <lb/>mean that households in lower income quintiles do not use enough services to incur catastrophic <lb/>expenditures. <lb/>91. <lb/>Information on the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in total household income or consumption <lb/>disaggregated by income group is collected through regular household expenditure surveys in a number of <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">8 <lb/>Another analysis of data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey found that Americans under the age of 35 <lb/>spent an average of 2.7% of their income on health care, as compared with 12.9% among those 65 and over, <lb/>despite the fact that insurance coverage through Medicare is universal for the latter group, while about 15% of <lb/>those 35 and under lack health insurance coverage. Those with incomes under USD 20 000 spent 15.2% of <lb/>their income on health care, compared with 2.6% of those with incomes of USD 70 000 and above. This <lb/>analysis is presented in a Medicare chart book available on the website of the US Centres for Medicare and <lb/>Medicaid Services (www.cms.gov). <lb/></note>

			<body>OECD countries. Some further developmental work would be needed to obtain comparable data on this <lb/>type of measure across countries. <lb/>2.3 Health care utilisation <lb/>92. <lb/>Socioeconomic status is an important factor in determining how populations utilise health care <lb/>services. Income, education and occupational status affect health care need, recognition and response to <lb/>health symptoms, knowledge of disease, and access and choice of health services. Although people in <lb/>lower socioeconomic groups tend to have higher rates of disease and mortality, they do not necessarily <lb/>utilise health care at greater rates. <lb/>93. <lb/>After adjusting for differences in the need for health care, the use of primary health care is <lb/>generally found to be equitable or fairly distributed, but research has found a &apos;pro-rich&apos; bias in the use of <lb/>specialist and dental care, as well as in the use of preventative services such as breast and cervical cancer <lb/>screening (Van Doorslaer &amp; Masseria in OECD, 2004b; Mielck et al. in Mackenbach &amp; EUROTHINE, <lb/>2007; WHO, 2008; Gakidou, 2008). <lb/>94. <lb/>Van Doorslaer &amp; Masseria (OECD, 2004b) used a sophisticated measure, the concentration <lb/>index, to measure income-related inequality in the use of various types of medical care in OECD countries. <lb/>The study aimed at comparing the actual distribution of medical and dental care by income, adjusted by <lb/>need. Survey data were sourced from the European Community Household Panel conducted in 2000 by <lb/>Eurostat, as well as from national health surveys in non-EU countries. Results for specialist visits are <lb/>shown in Figure 15. Even after health service need was accounted for, higher income persons in all <lb/>surveyed countries – except the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway – were more intensive users <lb/>of specialist visits than lower income groups. This was especially so for Portugal, Finland, Ireland and <lb/>Italy, four countries where private insurance and direct private payments play a role in accessing specialist <lb/>services. More recent research has also found that, after controlling for need, people with higher education <lb/>levels in nine European countries tend to use specialist care more than less-educated people (Or et al., 2008). <lb/>Figure 15: Horizontal inequity indices for specialist care use in 17 countries, 2000 or nearest available year <lb/>-0.05 <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.15 <lb/>0.20 <lb/>0.25 <lb/>0.30 <lb/>UK NLD BEL DEU CAN GRC HUN FRA NOR ESP SUI AUT DNK ITA IRL FIN PRT <lb/>Note: Specialist care is inequitable (in this case, favouring high income groups) if the 95% confidence limit is significantly different <lb/>from zero.

			<body>95. <lb/>Table 4 presents data from the Dutch National Survey of General Practice, carried out in 2001. <lb/>After correcting for demographics and for self-rated health, less educated persons visited GPs more often <lb/>than persons with higher education levels, but their utilisation rates were significantly lower for a number <lb/>of services, including dental visits, psychosocial care and Pap smear use (cervical cancer screening). <lb/>Further exploration of these data found lower utilisation of care among certain immigrant populations and <lb/>asylum seekers, among persons in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and among marginalised groups such as <lb/>illegal residents (Westert &amp; Verkleij, 2006). <lb/>96. <lb/>Health interview surveys are a major source of data on both health care use and socioeconomic <lb/>status. By also using available information on age, sex and health status, it is possible to adjust health care <lb/>use by some measure of need where applicable, as illustrated by the results from the Dutch survey. <lb/>However, the reliability of survey estimates depend on the methodology used and an adequate sample size, <lb/>while the comparability of data across countries depends on the harmonisation of questions and other <lb/>aspects of survey methodologies. There is also some doubt as to whether the reception of evidence-based <lb/>necessary care can be accurately assessed through self-report questionnaires. <lb/>Table 4: Care utilisation by level of education, persons aged over 25, The Netherlands, 2001 <lb/>Level of education (per cent) <lb/>Odds ratio <lb/>Low <lb/>Middle <lb/>High <lb/>Corrected for <lb/>demographics <lb/>Corrected for <lb/>demographics and <lb/>self-rated health <lb/>General practitioner <lb/>51 <lb/>42 <lb/>36 <lb/>1.4* <lb/>1.2 <lb/>Physiotherapist <lb/>16 <lb/>16 <lb/>14 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Home care <lb/>14 <lb/>6 <lb/>3 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Dentist <lb/>39 <lb/>76 <lb/>86 <lb/>0.2* <lb/>0.2* <lb/>Medical specialist <lb/>26 <lb/>21 <lb/>19 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>Admission to hospital, nursing <lb/>home or rehabilitation centre <lb/>11 <lb/>7 <lb/>6 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Psychosocial care <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>0.5* <lb/>0.5* <lb/>Alternative medicine <lb/>5 <lb/>7 <lb/>9 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>Prescribed medicines <lb/>23 <lb/>16 <lb/>13 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Pap smear (women aged 30–59) <lb/>75 <lb/>82 <lb/>85 <lb/>0.5* <lb/>0.6* <lb/>X-rays breast (women aged 18 <lb/>and over) <lb/>46 <lb/>38 <lb/>29 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>Notes: <lb/>(1) Odds ratio &gt;1 indicates people with low level of education use more care than people with high level of education.

These two indices use all <lb/></body>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>available data, and do not focus simply on those persons in the highest and lowest SES groups. Of the two, <lb/>the concentration index provides a means of quantifying the degree of socioeconomic-related inequality in <lb/>a specific health variable (O&apos;Donnell et al., 2008). The concentration index measure has been criticised by <lb/>some researchers on the grounds that it is difficult to calculate and interpret, and it is open to <lb/>misunderstanding (Mackenbach &amp; Kunst, 1997). One option for policy makers and researchers is to use the <lb/>concentration index as an adjunct to more simple and straightforward measures of health inequality. <lb/>2.4 Unmet care needs <lb/>98. <lb/>An additional measure of health care access is whether people report an unmet care need for <lb/>some reason, whether a doctor visit, a dental consultation, a hospital admission or another type of care. In <lb/>order to determine unmet care, individuals are typically asked health interview questions of the nature: <lb/> &quot; Was there a time in the previous 12 months that you felt you needed health care services but did not <lb/>receive them? &quot; , followed by a question to determine why the need for care was unmet. Such questions are <lb/>a feature of a number of national and cross-national health interview surveys, including EU-SILC, the <lb/>recommended health care module in EHIS, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe <lb/>(SHARE), the international health policy surveys conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, and the Joint <lb/>Canada/United States Survey of Health. <lb/>99. <lb/>Research indicates that unmet care needs are experienced mostly by people with low SES, <lb/>whether through low income, lack of insurance coverage, or because they come from a racial or ethnic <lb/>minority group. Common reasons given for care needs not being met include excessive costs of care, <lb/>excessive waiting times to receive care, or having to travel too far to receive care (Sanmartin et al., 2004; <lb/>Mielck et al., in Mackenbach &amp; EUROTHINE, 2007). <lb/>100. <lb/>The International Health Policy surveys regularly conducted by the Commonwealth Fund report <lb/>on unmet care among a number of non-European countries, as well as in Germany, the Netherlands and the <lb/>United Kingdom (Figure 16). The 2007 survey found that foregone care for a number of different <lb/>treatments due to costs remains more prevalent among lower income groups, although the level is much <lb/>lower in the United Kingdom than in the United States. In the United States, adults with below-average <lb/>incomes who have health insurance report significantly fewer access problems due to cost than their <lb/>uninsured counterparts (Blendon et al., 2002). <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUSION <lb/>104. <lb/>This paper has surveyed indicators that might be used to measure socioeconomic inequalities in <lb/>health status, and in health care access and use. <lb/>105. <lb/>Based on the criteria of policy relevancy, interpretability and data availability across countries, a <lb/>number of potential indicators are suggested, along with an indication of how frequently these indicators <lb/>might be collected. To allow broad comparisons across OECD countries, improvements in data availability <lb/>and comparability would need to be made for many of the suggested indicators. Regarding mortality-based <lb/>measures, the main challenge for countries is to link data from mortality registers to a measure of <lb/>socioeconomic status (SES). For the purpose of international comparison, the same measure of SES (be it <lb/>income, education or occupation) would need to be used in all countries. Regarding morbidity-based <lb/>measures, the main challenge is to further harmonise a key set of questions in national health survey <lb/>modules on health status and health care use, and to be able to link this information with a standard <lb/>measure of SES. This is currently being done in Europe through the development of the European Health <lb/>Interview Survey. Comparisons might also be broadened by expanding the country coverage in multi-<lb/>country surveys, such as those conducted by the Commonwealth Fund. <lb/>106. <lb/>Survey-based measures of health status and of health care access and use might be subject to a <lb/>number of potential limitations, such as cultural biases, recall biases, different coverage of the population <lb/>(e.g., inclusion or exclusion of the population in institutions), and issues related to the representativeness of <lb/>the survey sample. Nonetheless, health-related surveys remain a unique source of data in most countries to <lb/>measure socioeconomic inequalities in health status and health care access and use. While cultural factors <lb/>might affect responses to survey questions that are more subjective in terms of the average level across <lb/>countries, they are likely to have a lesser impact if the focus of the analysis is on disparities across <lb/>socioeconomic groups within each country (assuming that the different socioeconomic groups in each <lb/>country share common cultural characteristics). <lb/>107. <lb/>The indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health and health care access judged at this stage <lb/>to be feasible for regular (i.e. annual or biennial) collection include: self-rated health, self-rated disability, <lb/>and measures of unmet care needs. Indicators that are judged feasible to collect for a reasonable number of <lb/>countries, but which are more suited to periodic collection (i.e. every three to five years) include: life <lb/>expectancy, total mortality rate, infant mortality rate, the proportion of the population who do not have any <lb/>health care coverage (for the few countries where this may be relevant), measures of health care use <lb/>(adjusted where appropriate for need), and the share of out-of-pocket expenditure. Collection of the <lb/>different indicators of healthy life expectancy (disability-free life expectancy, health adjusted life <lb/>expectancy, and disability adjusted life years) is less feasible, given the current state of data development. <lb/>108. <lb/>The examples discussed in this paper help underline some of the issues involved in making valid <lb/>multi-country comparisons of health inequality, not the least of which are harmonisation of definitions and <lb/>measurement instruments, and the need for data linkages in order to allow disaggregation by SES. The <lb/>effort made to improve data availability and comparability will determine whether health inequalities can <lb/>be regularly monitored across most or all OECD Countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX 1: A SUMMARY OF THE &quot; EFFECTIVE COVERAGE &quot; MEASURE <lb/>109. <lb/>The notion of &quot; effective coverage &quot; was introduced several years ago as a way of refining the <lb/>WHO framework for health system performance assessment (WHO, 2003). It has been defined as &quot; the <lb/>proportion of potential health gain that can be delivered through an intervention by the health system that is <lb/>actually delivered &quot; (Lozano et al., 2006). If, for example, a health system could increase life expectancy <lb/>for women by two years through early detection and treatment for cervical cancer, but delivers only one <lb/>year, then effective coverage for this health problem is 50%. Effective coverage attempts to bring together <lb/>measures of the use of interventions, conditional on need, with the quality of the intervention delivered. <lb/>110. <lb/>One of the first countries which tried to implement a measure of effective coverage was Mexico, <lb/>and some initial results are presented in Figure 18. Using data collection systems including health <lb/>examination surveys, vital registrations and hospital discharge information, 14 different health <lb/>interventions were monitored in 2005–06. 9 Effective coverage for these 14 interventions taken together <lb/>was found to vary across different areas of Mexico, from 54% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65% in the more <lb/>affluent Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions varied by <lb/>household wealth, from 52% for the lowest wealth quintile to 61% for the highest quintile. Inequalities <lb/>existed between income quintiles for the combination of all 14 interventions measured, for maternal and <lb/>child health coverage (8 interventions) and for other adult interventions (6 interventions). The absolute gap <lb/>in effective maternal and child health coverage was 9% between lowest and higher income quintiles, and <lb/>14% for other adult interventions (Lozano et al., 2006). <lb/>111. <lb/>The selection of interventions to monitor is dependent on available data, and several sources may <lb/>be needed. These include biomedical data (e.g. to test for HIV infection, blood pressure, blood sugar or <lb/>cholesterol). A number of important questions need to be answered in order to determine effective <lb/>coverage, namely, who needs an intervention, who receives the intervention and what was the quality of <lb/>the intervention? Answering each of these requires measurement. To enable cross-country comparison, a <lb/>core set of coverage indicators and a standard survey module are needed, with measurement of the <lb/>distribution of coverage carried out across all socioeconomic groups. Effective coverage may have broad <lb/>applicability in both developing and developed countries, although substantial data developmental work <lb/>would be needed to implement this approach at the national and international level. <lb/>9 <lb/>The interventions are: measles immunisation, DTP3 immunisation, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, <lb/>services delivered to premature babies, treatment of acute respiratory infections in children, treatment of <lb/>diarrhoea in children, breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, treatment of vision disorders, <lb/>treatment of hypertension, treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, influenza vaccine. <lb/></body>
