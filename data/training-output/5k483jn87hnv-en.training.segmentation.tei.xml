			<body>Introduction <lb/>The objective of the paper is to lay out the state of knowledge on the role of innovation and the <lb/>diffusion of technologies in the greening of global value chains as well as some of the main policy <lb/>issues and key research gaps 1 . A special emphasis will be put on developing countries in which <lb/>innovation, skills and technological absorptive capacities tend to be lower while green technologies <lb/>are urgently needed. The structure of the paper is extremely simple. In a first part, we give some <lb/>concepts and definitions on technology, innovation, and the channels of technology diffusion. In a <lb/>second part, we use various statistics (green patents, trade flows, and foreign direct investments) <lb/>and illustrative examples to describe how technology and knowledge is created today and <lb/>disseminated across countries. For data reasons, we mostly focus on climate-mitigation technologies, <lb/>but there are good reasons to think that other green technologies do not significantly differ from the <lb/> &quot; average &quot; climate mitigation technology. Then, we list and discuss key policy challenges (the role of <lb/>environmental policies, intellectual property rights, capacity building, etc.). The conclusion <lb/>summarizes the main lessons. <lb/>The title of the conference is fully adequate for the so-called &quot; green economy &quot; does not consist in <lb/>the creation of a new economy, but mostly, in the gradual greening of existing traditional economic <lb/>activities. The concept of green technology is extremely vast as this refers to the use of technology <lb/>that makes traditional products and processes more environmentally friendly, for example, by <lb/>reducing CO2 emissions, by making products more biodegradeable, etc. In practice, many green <lb/>technologies are cleaner variants of standard technologies. It follows that most of the mechanisms <lb/>and trends discussed below are not specific to green techs. This is good news as we can rely on many <lb/>results from a well-developed general literature on the interactions between globalization and <lb/>technology. <lb/>1 <lb/>Concepts and definitions <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Technology is information <lb/>From an economic perspective, technology consists in the application of information either tacit <lb/>(know-how, skills) or coded (drawings, models, chemical formulas) in the design, production, and <lb/>utilization of goods and services. In contrast with science, the creation of new technology is primarily <lb/></body>

			<body>a business matter. As an illustration, the share of climate-related patents – protecting technologies <lb/>aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions – filed by public bodies is in average less than ten <lb/>percent in most countries. 2 <lb/>Contrary to standard tangible goods, technology and knowledge production and dissemination <lb/>inevitably involves a public policy dimension. The fundamental reason is that information has public <lb/>good properties: it is non-rival in use -information is not exhausted after its use by the innovator –, <lb/>and (partly) non excludable – restricting access to information is difficult. As a result, technology can <lb/>be imitated. This is a major obstacle to its production by the market. Indeed, the development of an <lb/>invention usually requires a (potentially large) upfront investment, which an inventor may be <lb/>reluctant to incur if others, in particular competitors, appropriate a part of the value of innovation. <lb/>Diffusion is a crucial, but tricky stage in the innovative process: It is when the technology is used, and <lb/>thus when it yields benefits in the field. But it is also when others can imitate the technology, <lb/>hindering inventors from exploiting their technology so as to benefit from market exclusivity. Any <lb/>public policy should thus find ways to boost diffusion while preserving incentives to innovate. We <lb/>consider in detail in Section 3 the potential of different policy instruments such as R&amp;D subsidies, or <lb/>patent law. <lb/>Learning-by-searching versus learning-by-doing <lb/>Technologies are obviously created within specialized R&amp;D departments or organizations (learning-<lb/>by-searching), but also through learning-by-doing which refers to the capability of workers to <lb/>improve their productivity by regularly repeating the same type of action. The increased productivity <lb/>is achieved through practice, self-perfection and minor innovations. Learning-by-doing potentially <lb/>yields very large efficiency gains. The learning rate is for instance about 20 percent for photovoltaic <lb/>energy technologies in the studies surveyed by De La Tour et al. (2013), meaning that (unit) costs fall <lb/>by twenty percent for each doubling of cumulative production. The existence of learning-by-doing <lb/>has crucial policy implications as it means that public policies should not only target R&amp;D activities, <lb/>but also downstream activities of the innovation process (experimentation, technology deployment, <lb/>and commercialization). It is a form of knowledge creation which seems easier to reach for certain <lb/>developing countries, which have less advanced technology capabilities. <lb/>The channels of technology transfer <lb/>The notion of &quot; technology transfer &quot; can be confusing, for these transfers may concern either <lb/>intangible knowledge as such, or the physical support in which this knowledge is embedded. The <lb/>economic literature 3 argues that technology and the related knowledge may be transferred through <lb/>voluntary transactions aiming at commercializing and/or exploiting technological products in the <lb/>recipient country. Three market channels are usually distinguished (see Table 1 and Popp, 2009). <lb/></body>

			<body>International trade in intermediate goods. The import of capital goods, such as machines and <lb/>equipment, entails technology transfer for such goods embody technologies which can then bring <lb/>productivity benefits in the recipient countries. International trade induces however little cross-<lb/>border transfer of knowledge as such, simply because this knowledge remains in the originating <lb/>country and is directly exploited there. Yet even in this case, there may be knowledge spillovers in <lb/>the recipient country (Rivera-Batiz and Romer, 1991). Local firms can indeed reverse-engineer <lb/>imported products, or acquire knowledge through business relationships (e.g., as customer or <lb/>distributor) with the source company. As an illustration, China has acquired production technologies <lb/>to develop a highly performing solar photovoltaic industry by purchasing turnkey production lines to <lb/>German, US and Japanese suppliers (de la Tour et al., 2011). They are now able to produce <lb/>production equipment on their own. <lb/>Foreign direct investments (including joint ventures). Several studies find evidence that <lb/>multinational enterprises transfer firm-specific technology to their foreign affiliates or partners in <lb/>joint-ventures (e.g., Lee and Mansfield, 1996; Branstetter et al., 2006). FDI induce more knowledge <lb/>transfer than trade in goods, for it aims at exploiting it directly in a local subsidiary of the source <lb/>company or in a joint-venture – and not in the source country anymore. The transfer is particularly <lb/>important with joint-ventures as the local partner has a direct access to the technology. FDI might <lb/>also generate local spillovers through labor turnover if local employees of the subsidiary move to <lb/>domestic firms. Local firms may also increase their productivity by observing nearby foreign firms or <lb/>becoming their suppliers or customers. Overall, the literature finds strong evidence that FDI is an <lb/>important channel for technology diffusion. This is for example the key vector of technology transfer <lb/>in the wind industry (Kirkegaard et al., 2009). <lb/>Licensing. The third channel of technology diffusion—and the most direct—is when corporations or <lb/>public research bodies grant a patent license to a company abroad that uses it to upgrade its own <lb/>production (by extension, a copyright or a brand). That is, a firm may license its technology. The very <lb/>purpose of licensing is finally to carry out a full knowledge transfer to the licensor so as to enable it <lb/>to exploit it directly. Accordingly, knowledge leaves both the source country and the source <lb/>company, and lay now in the hands of a local third party. In practice, international licensing mostly <lb/>concerns three sectors: chemicals and drugs, and electronics and electrical equipment. <lb/>This description of the channels yield a fundamental message: Encouraging economic globalization is <lb/>the fundamental approach to promote the international diffusion of knowledge and technologies <lb/>through the development of international trade, FDI, and the international circulation of skilled <lb/>individuals. <lb/>Table 1 : Knowledge location and mechanisms of internal diffusion in the different transfer <lb/>channels (Glachant et al., 2013) <lb/>Knowledge location <lb/>Diffusion mechanism in the <lb/>recipient country <lb/>Transfer channels <lb/>Geographical <lb/>Legal <lb/>Export of equipment goods <lb/>Source country <lb/>Source company <lb/>Reverse engineering <lb/>Foreign direct investment <lb/>Recipient country <lb/>Source company <lb/>Reverse engineering <lb/>+ labor circulation <lb/></body>

Responding to that <lb/>question is crucial for, if affirmative, discouraging diffusion might be a way to provide local inventors <lb/>with higher incentives to develop technologies at home. In fact, innovation and technology diffusion <lb/>rather tend to complement each other. Deploying a technology developed abroad frequently <lb/>requires skills and knowledge which are partly the same as those used for innovation. Accordingly, <lb/>adopting foreign technologies boost innovation at home and conversely. As an illustration, China is <lb/>both the top inventor and the top technology importer emerging economy for climate-mitigation <lb/>technologies (as we will see below in Tables 2 and 3). In fact both strategies improve so-called <lb/>technological absorptive capacities. <lb/>2 <lb/>Innovation and international technology diffusion towards the <lb/>developing world: available evidence <lb/>2.1 <lb/>Innovation through learning by searching <lb/>As indicated above, innovation comes through two mechanisms: learning by searching and learning <lb/>by doing. Patent counts offer an indicator to measure the output of the forme 4 r. It has been used <lb/>extensively in recent studies which clearly show that learning-by-searching remains mostly located in <lb/>the industrialized world. As an illustration, Table 2 shows the share of climate patented inventions by <lb/>country. China is the only emerging economy in the Top 10. Other major emerging economies or <lb/>transition countries such as India, Russia or Brazil account for less than 1% of world innovation. Other <lb/>studies dealing with waste or green chemistry confirm the stylized facts. 5 <lb/>Table 2: Top ten inventor countries in climate innovation and selected emerging economies <lb/>Rank <lb/>Country <lb/>Share of world climate patented <lb/>inventions (2007-2009)* <lb/>1 <lb/>USA <lb/>19.0% <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 The proxy is however imperfect for various reasons: First, patents are only one of the means of protecting <lb/>inventions, along with lead time, industrial secrecy, or purposely complex specifications. Second, the <lb/>propensity to patent differs between sectors, depending on the nature of the technology. Last, the value of <lb/>individual patents is heterogeneous. Counting international patent families – inventions that have been <lb/>patented in at least countries – partly mitigates this problem. For an extensive discussion of these limitations, <lb/>see Johnstone et al. (2011). <lb/>5 OECD (2011), Invention and Transfer of Environmental Technologies, Paris, OECD. <lb/></note>

Mean of 25 climate technology shares. <lb/>2.2 The diffusion of technologies towards the developing world <lb/>It is also possible to rely on patent statistics to measure the flows of technologies across countries. In <lb/>particular, the count of patent applications in a given country for technologies invented abroad is an <lb/>indicator of the volume of imported technologies. Because international trade and FDI are major <lb/>channels for the transmission of technology knowledge across countries, the inflows of intermediate <lb/>goods or FDI is also a possible proxy. <lb/>Table 3 relies on these three indicators to measure the climate technologies imported in selected <lb/>emerging economies. It shows seemingly limited flows except towards China which represents <lb/>between 7 and 15% of the world imports of technologies, depending on the indicator used. But the <lb/>figures are actually not that low. To begin with, they are much higher than the percentages given in <lb/>the previous table dealing with innovation. Moreover, they are more or less in line with each <lb/>country&apos;s economy size as measured by the GDP. Two exceptions are Russia and India which <lb/>accounts for 3.3% and 4.9% of the world GDP whereas, depending in indicators used, the size of <lb/>inward transfers represent between 1.3 and 2.2% for the former and about 1.5% for the latter. <lb/>All in all, contrary to innovation, emerging economies appear to participate, albeit to varying <lb/>degrees, in the global exchange of climate-friendly technologies, simply because they are key actors <lb/>of the economic globalization. Note that the diffusion of climate-mitigation patented technologies is <lb/>higher than that of non-green ones, but international trade is lower (in Table 3, see statistics in <lb/>parentheses). This probably reflects different time horizons: international trade is driven by the <lb/>current demand for green technologies, which is quite low in developing countries where <lb/>environmental and climate policies are less advanced. Patenting is driven by the demand which is <lb/>expected in the next 20 years. The figures suggest that patent holders anticipate a significant <lb/>demand increase in the future. <lb/>In contrast, least-developed countries have very limited access to foreign green technologies as they <lb/>are mostly connected to the global economy through raw material markets. <lb/></body>

That is, a set of government policies and conditions creating and <lb/>maintaining an overall macroeconomic environment favorable to innovation and technology <lb/>diffusion? The goal of this part is to identify and assess various components of such environments. <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Creating demand <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Creating demand for green technologies via environmental policies inducing pollution abatement <lb/>and environmental protection is a prerequisite for green innovation and technology diffusion. The <lb/>reason is that cutting emissions or protecting the environment is generally not privately profitable <lb/>yet under standard market conditions. In the absence of public policies providing incentives and <lb/>imposing constraints on emissions and polluting practices, households and corporations are thus <lb/>unlikely to adopt green technologies. This conveys what is probably the most important message of <lb/>our policy discussion. Increasing innovation and diffusion of technologies can only occur in the <lb/>presence of ambitious environmental policies with proper enforcement (e.g., carbon taxes, Cap &amp; <lb/>Trade system, emission standards, etc.). This has been documented by many studies both for <lb/>innovation (Brunnermeier and Cohen, 2003; Newell et al., 1999; Popp, 2002; Crabb and Johnson, <lb/>2010) and international technology diffusion (Lanjouw and Mody, 1996; Popp et al., 2007; Verdolini <lb/>and Galeotti, 2011, Dechezleprêtre et al., 2013) <lb/>Environmental policies are designed and implemented at the national level, and they tend to be <lb/>stricter in advanced economies as developing countries logically give priority to economic <lb/>development and poverty alleviation. Can developing countries then participate in the greening of <lb/>global value chains, acquire green techs and innovate without ambitious environmental policies at <lb/>home? <lb/>The answer is yes for technology transfer as illustrated by the photovoltaic industry. In just a few <lb/>years, China became a world leader in the manufacturing of both photovoltaic panels. Chinese PV <lb/>companies acquire the necessary technologies to export cells and panels in countries such as <lb/>Germany, Spain, or the US where feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards trigger massive <lb/>installations of PV production capacities. In fact, if barriers to trade and transportation costs are low <lb/>and if the developing country&apos;s workforce is sufficiently qualified, there are no reasons why <lb/>production and the necessary technologies remain located in the countries with environmental <lb/>demand. <lb/>Of course, it could give birth to serious political difficulties: Political leaders in many countries <lb/>frequently argue that ambitious environmental and climate domestic policies can help local firms <lb/>achieve technological leadership, thereby improving the competitiveness of the national economy. <lb/>But if these policies also strengthen foreign competitors, this might weaken their ability to generate a <lb/>competitive advantage. In turn, this creates a risk of trade war as illustrated today by the conflict on <lb/>photovoltaic panels between China on the one hand, and the US and the European Union on the <lb/>other hand. <lb/>The answer is less obvious for innovation. Two recent studies on wind and solar technologies even <lb/>show that the impact of foreign environmental policies on local innovation is much lower than that <lb/>of domestic demand (Dechezleprêtre and Glachant, 2011; Peters et al., 2012). These results suggest <lb/>that the international division of labor could lead to the specialization in innovative activities of <lb/>certain (industrialized) countries with stricter environmental policies. <lb/>3.2 <lb/>Technological capacity building <lb/>Technological capabilities – such as availability of skilled technical personnel, information on <lb/>available technologies, social institutions that reduce transactions costs – determine a country&apos;s <lb/>ability to successfully innovate and absorb foreign technologies. Eaton and Kortum (1996) show for <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>instance that countries with strong absorptive capacities such as Japan and European OECD countries <lb/>derive almost all of their productivity growth from R&amp;D carried out abroad. Absorptive capacities <lb/>also facilitate local knowledge spillovers from international trade and FDI, and thus wider diffusion of <lb/>this knowledge within the recipient country. <lb/>Helping developing countries to build absorptive technological capacities should thus be given <lb/>priority through various means, including education, cooperative research, development and <lb/>demonstration programs. As shown by Figure 4, green technologies draw on scientific knowledge <lb/>from many sciences, among which energy and environmental sciences only account for about 12 <lb/>percent. It suggests that encouraging education and training in narrow technology fields may be less <lb/>important than generic programs addressing a broad range of disciplines. <lb/>Figure 1: The innovation-science link in green technologies (2000-2007) <lb/>Source: Measuring Innovation: A New Perspective, OECD (2010) <lb/>3.3 <lb/>The role of trade and FDI barriers <lb/>As argued before, international technology transfers take place through market channels such as <lb/>trade or FDI. Accordingly, lowering barriers to trade and FDI is an effective policy leverage to foster <lb/>the transfer of green technologies. <lb/>It is however worth discussing further the precise design of regulations in more detail. Non-tariff <lb/>barriers such as local content requirements -which mandate to give preference to local contractors <lb/>and locally manufactured materials and equipment – or regulations promoting joint ventures with a <lb/>local partner instead of greenfield investments or mergers and acquisitions are widespread practices. <lb/>They have been implemented in the wind industry in countries including Canada, China, Spain, Brazil, <lb/>India, Australia and Portugal with varying levels of success. Another example is the Chinese law on <lb/>CDM which says that the ownership of a foreign party in a CDM project shall not exceed 49%. <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>Such provisions have ambiguous effects on technology transfer and diffusion. On the one hand, they <lb/>obviously lower the incentives for foreign companies to invest locally and reduce imports of <lb/>equipment goods. On the other hand, they may help the diffusion of technologies within the <lb/>economy. This is even the prime goal of regulation promoting joint-ventures which allows the <lb/>transmission of knowledge and skills to the local partners. The net result of these two effects is likely <lb/>to vary a lot across sectors and countries. But it can be positive in sectors and countries where the <lb/>size of the market, the quality of infrastructure and the absorptive capacities are sufficient to attract <lb/>foreign investors despite these constraints. <lb/>3.4 <lb/>The controversial role of intellectual property rights on technology transfer <lb/>Beside financial incentives such as R&amp;D subsidies or tax credits, patent law is a key policy tool to <lb/>create incentives to mitigate the incentive problem described in the first part of the paper. Patents <lb/>confer upon their owner the exclusive right to make, use, and sell the protected invention for a <lb/>maximum period of twenty years, during which the patent owner is able to extract profits from his <lb/>invention. Keeping in mind that the prime goal of IPR is to promote innovation, wether a stronger IP <lb/>regime fosters the transfer of climate-mitigation technology to developing countries is a <lb/>controversial issue in international climate negotiations. Serious arguments with opposite <lb/>conclusions are available: <lb/>• IPR is a property right, and the existence of property rights is a precondition for the <lb/>emergence of markets that will diffuse technologies across market participants. <lb/> • In theory, a patent holder has two options. It can commercially exploit its invention. This <lb/>limits the use of the invention, but not necessarily its impact if the products in which the <lb/>technology is embodied are widely sold. Alternatively, the inventor can license its invention <lb/>to other companies. IP can then restrict diffusion if royalty fees are high. In both cases, the <lb/>outcome depends on the intensity of competition. If the technology does not have efficient <lb/>and reliable substitutes, the inventor might be able to raise price barriers, hindering the <lb/>diffusion of the technology itself or of the goods in which the technology is embedded. <lb/>Conversely, a patent does not hinder diffusion if competition is fierce. <lb/> • In return of legal exclusivity, patenting requires the inventors to disclose publicly information <lb/>on the technology. This publication generates positive knowledge spillovers as other <lb/>inventors may draw inspiration to develop new technologies. This property of IPR is in sharp <lb/>contrast with other tools used by innovators to appropriate technologies such as trade <lb/>secret.<lb/>As a result, whether IPRs promote technology diffusion or not cannot receive a general answer solely <lb/>based on theoretical arguments. Fortunately, several empirical studies have tested the different <lb/>hypotheses. General studies dealing with all technologies suggest that strict IPR enforcement have an <lb/>average positive effect on the volume of foreign technology transfers to developing countries. This <lb/>effect is clear when the recipient country is technologically advanced and open to international trade <lb/>(Sampath and Roffe, 2012). In this case, strong local absorptive capacities enable effective transfers, <lb/>but also create a serious threat of imitation for foreign innovators (Maskus 2000; Smith 2001; <lb/>Hoekman, Maskus, and Saggi 2005; Mancusi 2008; Parello 2008). Because it provides a safeguard <lb/>against such imitation, strong IP protection then facilitates technology transfers in the recipient <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>country. There is also empirical evidence that it encourages the use of knowledge-intensive channels <lb/>such as FDI and licenses instead of the mere export of equipment goods (Smith 2001). <lb/>Several studies confirm these insights in the specific case of climate-friendly technologies. <lb/>(Dechezleprêtre et al., 2013; Barton, 2007; Maskus, 2010) shows that patenting has not been a <lb/>barrier for the transfer of solar PV, wind power, and biofuel technologies in emerging economies. See <lb/>also the analysis of the wind sector by Kirkegaard et al. (2009), that of the PV sector by <lb/>Dechezleprêtre et al. (2011), and the study of the transfer of integrated gasification combined <lb/>cycle—the most efficient coal power technology—to India (Ockwell et al., 2008). <lb/>These results are driven by the fact that climate-friendly technologies mostly exist in mature sectors <lb/>wherein numerous substitutes can compete at the global scale. In this respect, the situation for low <lb/>carbon technologies is not comparable today with the pharmaceutical industry in which certain drugs <lb/>have no substitutes or with information technologies in which the existence of technical <lb/>complementarity and compatibility issues induce &quot; blocking &quot; patents. But, there is no reason why <lb/>green technologies would be immune to similar difficulties for eternity. In particular, the discovery of <lb/>a &quot; breakthrough &quot; technology in certain sectors (e.g., CCS, smart grids, and biofuels) can change the <lb/>landscape. <lb/>The case of less advanced countries that lack technological capabilities is different. In these <lb/>countries, strengthening IP rights is not the key issue (Haščič et al., 2012). Stronger IP protection may <lb/>even induce less transfers– as the threat of imitation is not a serious deterrent for foreign firms – but <lb/>could generate stronger monopoly rents for foreign firms (Maskus, 2000; Smith, 2001). <lb/>3.5 <lb/>The Clean Development Mechanism <lb/>The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol (CDM) allows industrialized countries that <lb/>have accepted emissions reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex 1 countries) to develop <lb/>or finance projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries in exchange for emission <lb/>reduction credits. While its primary goal is to save abatement costs, the CDM also provides technical <lb/>and financial support for the diffusion of climate technology in non-Annex 1 countries 6 . If the <lb/>technology used in the project is not available in the host country, the project leads de facto to a <lb/>cross-border technology transfer. <lb/>Several empirical studies have been conducted in order to assess whether the CDM has encouraged <lb/>North-South technology transfer (de Coninck et al., 2007; Haites et al., 2006; Seres, 2007; <lb/>Dechezleprêtre et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2008). They conclude that roughly 40% of CDM projects <lb/>induce a technology transfer. These transfer mostly concern technical equipment and/or know-how, <lb/>rather than patented inventions 7 . They are more frequent in large projects, and in projects directly <lb/>involving Annex 1 companies either through local subsidiaries or as credit buyers in the project. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">6 Note that the CDM did not originally have an explicit technology transfer requirement in the Kyoto Protocol. <lb/>This was included later in the 2001 Marrakech Agreement. <lb/>7 Technology transfers mainly concern two areas, namely i) wind power and ii) end-of-pipe destruction of non-<lb/>CO2 GHG with high global warming potentials (such as HFCs, CH4 and N2O) in the chemicals, agricultural and <lb/>waste management sectors. Other projects, such as electricity production from biomass or energy-efficiency <lb/>measures in the industry sector, mainly rely on local technologies (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2008). <lb/></note>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>Despite these achievements, it is widely admitted that the CDM falls short of achieving the full <lb/>potential of developing countries in terms of both GHG abatements and technology diffusion. A first <lb/>general explanation lies in the high transaction costs that result from the tight evaluation <lb/>methodologies and monitoring procedures required for each project (see e.g., Hampton et al., 2008). <lb/>The CDM framework is also inappropriate when the scale of the project cannot account for all the <lb/>economic mechanisms at stake – for instance when there are synergies or economies of scale <lb/>between different projects (Glachant and Ménière, 2011). CDM methodologies similarly prove ill-<lb/>suited to complex projects involving capacity building and/or public policy actions (e.g., a modal shift <lb/>in the transport sector, or smart-grid transition). <lb/>Against this background, several evolutions of the CDM have been envisaged so far, which all consist <lb/>in relaxing the mechanism by widening the scope of projects. A first modest step in this direction has <lb/>been made with the implementation of programmatic CDM, which consists in pooling several CDM <lb/>projects within one single &quot;program&quot; so as to reduce the transaction costs of their formal validation. <lb/>More importantly, the Durban Platform adopted in the 2011 COP commits parties to formulate a so-<lb/>called New Market Mechanism (NMM) under the 2015 agreement. The nature of this mechanism <lb/>remains vague and rule-setting has been deferred to the 2013 COP in Warsaw. In contrast with the <lb/>CDM, the NMM could be sectoral in nature. It would go beyond the pure offsetting of emissions and <lb/>produce a net atmospheric benefit. It could also include sectoral crediting or trading, forming a <lb/>stepping stone towards a system of globally linked economy-wide cap-and-trade systems. <lb/>Like the CDM, the prime goal of the NMM would not be technology transfer. But there are good <lb/>reasons to think that it can perform better along dimension in comparison with the CDM. The <lb/>sectoral scope allows economies of scale and better coordination in the removal of common <lb/>technological and financial barriers. It enhances possibility of using public policy levers at the sectoral <lb/>level, which can focus on infrastructure investment and development of technical capacity needed to <lb/>achieve projects (capacity building). It could also facilitate the internalization of learning spillovers. <lb/>3.6 <lb/>Governmental environmental agreements <lb/>The CDM and the NMM are instruments of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate <lb/>Change (UNFCCC). It is worth opening a more general discussion about the potential contribution of <lb/>international environmental agreements to innovation and technology diffusion. To begin with, such <lb/>agreements necessarily increase the demand for green technologies in participating countries. They <lb/>thus boost domestic innovation and the import of foreign technologies as established for example by <lb/>Dekker et al. (2012) in the case of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. <lb/>The effectiveness of multilateral agreements however depends on the precise instruments used. In <lb/>this respect, many commentators suggest to rely on technology-oriented instruments, in particular <lb/>because they are seen as more acceptable by the negotiating parties than emissions-based <lb/>approaches (for instance, see Ockwell, 2010). In this respect, a Technology Mechanism was <lb/>established as an institutional entity in 2010 under the UNFCCC. It is meant to facilitate the <lb/>implementation of enhanced action on technology development and transfer in order to support <lb/>action on mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It consists of two components: <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>• A policy-making body called the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) comprising 20 high <lb/>level independent expert members, elected by the COP. The mandate of the TEC is to <lb/>support the design and coordination of inclusive action programmes for technology transfer <lb/>and diffusion, based on a thorough review of priority needs and barriers in recipient <lb/>countries. <lb/> • A Climate Technology Center and Network (CTC&amp;N). The CTC&amp;N currently exists only on <lb/>paper until it is hosted by another pre-existing organization. It will get to implement actual <lb/>transfer of technologies and perform its functions as mandated by the Conference of Parties <lb/>of the UNFCCC. The Climate Technology Centre shall facilitate a network of national, <lb/>regional, sectoral and international technology networks, organizations and initiatives with a <lb/>view to engaging the participants of the Network in effectively carrying out technology <lb/>development and diffusion.<lb/>It is obviously not possible to conclude about the effectiveness of the Technology Mechanism for its <lb/>precise activities have not been defined yet. But evaluation of previous experiences of technology-<lb/>oriented arrangements yields positive conclusions. For instance, Hascic et al. (2012) have shown that <lb/>the multilateral energy technology initiatives have had a very strong positive impact on transnational <lb/>cooperative R&amp;D activities (measured by the count of patented co-inventions). Another illustration is <lb/>the so-called Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol which helps <lb/>developing countries to meet the agreed incremental cost of fulfilling the Protocol&apos;s control <lb/>measures. <lb/>3.7 <lb/>Business-led agreements <lb/>Business-led initiatives are broad international agreements between companies belonging to the <lb/>same sector, in order to better coordinate their environmental actions through information sharing, <lb/>technology sharing, or joint technology development. <lb/>As an illustration, the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) aims to develop a sustainable <lb/>development strategy for the cement industry, and therefore incorporates climate change mitigation <lb/>in its objectives. In February 2011, this initiative included 23 major cement groups, represented in <lb/>more than 100 countries, and accounting for more than 40% of world production. Another example <lb/>is Worldsteel which aims to promote a sustainable development of the steel industry or the <lb/>International Aluminium Institute (IAI) including 27 industrial companies that represent about 80% of <lb/>world production. <lb/>Yet so far industry-led initiatives do not seem do have performed major achievements in terms of <lb/>carbon abatement and technology development and diffusion. Most of the actions initiated by the <lb/>CSI, IAI and WorldSteel are limited to benchmarking and sharing best practices. Only Worldsteel has <lb/>launched a long-term R&amp;D cooperation, while the ambitions of CSI in the matter have not <lb/>materialized yet. These modest achievements pertain to the lack of incentives for firms to actively <lb/>cooperate in sharing strategic information and technology with their rivals. Since industry-led <lb/>initiatives are primarily meant to anticipate the implementation of binding sector regulations in a <lb/>large enough number of countries, they may yet come to play a more important role were such <lb/>regulations to be adopted (or the threat thereof to be serious). In that case, they could prove an <lb/>interesting instrument to shape and harmonize these regulations at the international scale -including <lb/></body>

			<body>by facilitating the participation of developing countries in such policy schemes – and to organize joint <lb/>compliance through the development and diffusion of clean technologies. <lb/>4 <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Based on a well-developed academic literature on innovation and technology diffusion, we have tried <lb/>to describe how developing countries, in particular, emerging market economies, are innovating and <lb/>adopting green technology today and what policy approaches could foster their participation in the <lb/>globalization of knowledge, technology, and skills. <lb/>In practice, knowledge, skills and technologies mostly flow across countries through international <lb/>trade of equipment, foreign direct investments, joint-ventures and the associated circulation of <lb/>skilled workers. Hence economic globalization implies technology diffusion, almost by definition. In <lb/>contrast, economic globalization does not so directly induce the globalization of innovation. One can <lb/>even think that the international division of labor could lead to the specialization of certain <lb/>(industrialized) countries in innovative activities. Evidence from previous literature tends to confirm <lb/>this hypothesis. <lb/>The patterns of innovation and technology diffusion and policy challenges are different for emerging <lb/>economies and least-developed countries. The former group of countries is integrated in the global <lb/>economy with varying degrees. As a consequence, technologies already flow in through the imports <lb/>of capital goods and local investments by multinational enterprises owning technologies. Technology <lb/>providers are mostly located in industrialized countries whereas South-South technology transfer is <lb/>very limited. For the most part, technology diffusion towards the developing world is driven by a <lb/>demand for green technologies induced by environmental policies in industrialized countries <lb/>(including through the Clean Development Mechanism). Pushing further technology transfer towards <lb/>these economies requires strengthening intellectual property rights, lowering barriers to trade and <lb/>investments and improving technological absorptive capacities. <lb/>In contrast, statistics show that the role of emerging economies in the development of new <lb/>technologies is limited. Standard tools of innovation policy -public R&amp;D, public support to private <lb/>R&amp;D, better access to finance -should develop. But studies also suggest that governments should <lb/>introduce more stringent environmental policies with proper enforcement at home (e.g., stricter <lb/>emissions standards, cap and trade schemes, pollution taxes) to go beyond the adoption of foreign <lb/>technologies. <lb/>The situation of least-developed countries is very different: they do not import green technologies <lb/>and low barriers to trade and FDI or strict intellectual property rights are unlikely to trigger <lb/>technology transfer. In these countries, the focus should be on building technological capacities. <lb/>Research gaps and issues to be discussed <lb/>Although the literature has developed quickly (see the length of the list of references below), much <lb/>remains to be done and many issues need to be discussed: <lb/></body>

			<body>1. Many technology fields and sectors have received less attention than climate-related and <lb/>energy technologies. In particular, little is known about innovation and green technology <lb/>diffusion in agriculture and forestry. <lb/>2. As mentioned previously, international cooperation may constitute an effective means to <lb/>promote the globalization of knowledge and skills. But the precise design and the <lb/>effectiveness of various technology-oriented instruments to be implemented under <lb/>international agreements deserves more discussion and analysis (financing mechanisms, <lb/>cooperative research programs, etc.) <lb/>3. Developing countries need methodologies and roadmaps to identify priority technologies <lb/>and to adapt the policy instruments to local context. Some works have been done (e.g., <lb/>technology need assessments under the UNFCCC), but much remains to be done. <lb/>4. The distinction between emerging economies – which are increasingly integrated at various <lb/>stages of global value chains– and least-developed countries – with economies mostly based <lb/>on agriculture, forestry and the production of raw materials – is absolutely central. How <lb/>should we differentiate policy approaches related to Intellectual Property Rights, trade <lb/>regulation, capacity building, etc.? <lb/>5. Once a foreign technology is available in the country, how it disseminates in the recipient <lb/>economy is of utmost importance. Combining the promotion of technology imports and <lb/>internal diffusion is a tricky issue for the two objectives may contradict each other. In <lb/>particular, private actors transferring the technology usually seek to restrict its subsequent <lb/>dissemination in the host economy, in particular towards potential competitors. <lb/>6. How can poverty alleviation and the international diffusion of green technologies <lb/>complement each other? <lb/>7. Some industrialized countries and corporation clearly fear that technology transfer would <lb/>damage their competitiveness. How to maximize win-win solutions? <lb/></body>
