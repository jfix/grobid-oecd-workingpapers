The graph shows that there is also large heterogeneity across sectors,<lb/> with manufacturing of chemicals – including pharmaceuticals – (NACE 24), machinery and equipment<lb/> (NACE 29), and electrical and optical (NACE 30-33) showing as expected the largest patenting rates, all<lb/> reporting a share of patenting firms of around 20%.

As a consequence of the<lb/> interaction of those two factors – the technological inertia and the significant time variation in litigation<lb/> across fields – some firms exogenously find their prospective patent portfolio potentially more exposed to<lb/> litigation risks, which in turn decreases their incentives to develop new patents. The exogeneity assumption<lb/> also requires that changes in litigation propensity do not affect changes in firm&apos;s employment and capital<lb/> through other channels conditional on country-year and industry-year dummies – an assumption that seems<lb/> plausible.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore cross-country differences in<lb/> resource flows to patenting firms and further research on this issue is required. Indeed, a number of<lb/> avenues for future research emerge. First, the data underlying the current paper is based on matching<lb/> administrative data on patents and the commercial database ORBIS. As discussed this raises issues related<lb/> to sample representativeness and coverage, and it warrants some caution when interpreting some of the<lb/> results presented, e.g. on young firms. Therefore, one avenue for further research is to use information<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 39<lb/> from matching patent data with business register data, which cover the whole population of businesses and<lb/> survey data based on stratified random samples from National Statistical Offices.</figDesc>
