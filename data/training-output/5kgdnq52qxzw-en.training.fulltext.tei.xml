			<head>Executive Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>The results of this study show that overall trade patterns reflect the relative factor<lb/> endowments of the countries under investigation. That is, OECD countries have larger<lb/> stocks of capital and skilled labour and show relatively intensive use of these factors in<lb/> their traded goods and services. Selected Emerging Markets (SEMs) have large stocks of<lb/> unskilled labour and show strong trade surpluses in goods and services using this resource<lb/> intensively. In this sense, we show that factor content of trade, as measured via factor<lb/> services, provides useful insights into trade patterns, as predicted by neoclassical trade<lb/> theory.<lb/> However, some large economies, such as the United States and Japan, exhibit<lb/> counter-intuitive results as illustrated by large factor content of trade surpluses in<lb/> unskilled labour for Japan and deficits in the capital-content of trade for the United States.<lb/> Accounting for intermediate trade in our analysis reverses some of these seemingly<lb/> counter-intuitive results, and in general has a large impact on measured factor content.<lb/> We argue that this is a reflection of the changing nature of trade, driven by the forces of<lb/> production fragmentation and offshoring. We contend that these trends reflect a shift<lb/> away from thinking of trade in terms of domestically-based factor (i.e. labour or capital)<lb/> content, to thinking of trade in terms of internationally mobile tasks required to produce<lb/> output. The evidence presented here implies that factor content patterns are undergoing<lb/> fundamental changes calling for more careful analysis of the broad measures used in<lb/> trade. Trade patterns are now just as reliant on the cost of moving goods and tasks, as<lb/> they are on the particular endowment structure of an economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally we find little evidence that the changes in trade patterns have had a significant<lb/> impact on relative wages, or wage inequality, in the time period examined. We speculate<lb/> that domestic considerations, and the growing influence of tasks as opposed to<lb/> endowments, play a larger role in determining these outcomes. This is an important<lb/> finding that argues against the imposition of trade barriers in an attempt to influence<lb/> either wages or levels of employment, and in favour of pursuing targeted labour market<lb/> policies that would accommodate, rather than hinder, the process of adjustments,<lb/> including in the aftermath of trade reforms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another implication of this work for policy makers is the need to be aware that the<lb/> methods used to derive the value for trade balances matter. Those values based on<lb/> traditional approaches are more of a reflection of historical investments and could lead to<lb/> ‗lagging&apos; policy advice, based on past behaviour, rather than the forward looking advice<lb/> needed to steer an economy into the future.<lb/> Acknowledging the role of intermediate goods in understanding a country&apos;s trade<lb/> position is only the first step. What remains a challenge for policy makers is the need to<lb/> reconcile the seemingly opposing trends of the domestic (i.e. geographic specific)<lb/> determination of employment and wages with the international (i.e. non-geographic<lb/> specific) determination of the movement of goods and services and location of tasks.<lb/> Thus policy makers should appreciate the limits of using trade policy to influence<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The global economy is entering a new era characterised by a rise in new trade power-<lb/>houses (such as China) and intensifying competition for new consumer and product<lb/> markets (such as Asia and renewable energy, respectively). Indeed, there are a growing<lb/> number of economists who argue that the nature of international trade is changing in<lb/> fundamental ways (Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2010). Thus, it is argued that in an<lb/> integrated global market, trade is increasingly about intermediates goods and services.<lb/> Simultaneously, concern remains over the impacts of globalisation including excessive<lb/> market volatility, increased vulnerability to crises, and the perceived ability of low-wage<lb/> producers to disrupt domestic labour markets. Calls to ―manage‖ globalisation remain and<lb/> are unlikely to subside in the context of the current economic uncertainty and stalled<lb/> DDA talks.<lb/> Understanding the fundamental forces behind observed trading patterns has generally<lb/> been undertaken through what international economic theory would describe as a<lb/> realisation of comparative advantage; a country exports those goods in which it has a<lb/> relative cost advantage vis a vis its trading partners. This concept has powerful policy<lb/> implications in that from it stems the basic reasoning that free trade policies are superior<lb/> to interventionist trade practices. 1 However, comparative advantage evolves for a host of<lb/> reasons, including endowment structure, technology and the institutional landscape of<lb/> both domestic and international commerce. That is, comparative advantage can be<lb/> influenced by domestic policies in the trading countries themselves as well as those in<lb/> their trading partners. It is not a static concept; it influences, and is influenced by, policy<lb/> as well as stages of economic development and evolution (<ref type="biblio">Balassa 1979</ref>). This interaction<lb/> provides an interesting and complex context for an empirical study on patterns of<lb/> specialisation and comparative advantage and underlying policy implications for OECD<lb/> and non-OECD countries alike.<lb/> As per the original scoping paper, The Effects of Globalisation: Openness and<lb/> Changing Patterns of Comparative Advantage (OECD internal document), the project is<lb/> structured to deliver four consecutive reports, which will constitute its principal direct<lb/> outputs:<lb/>  Production, Consumption and Trade Developments.<lb/></p>

Trade<lb/> liberalisation and productivity links have been confirmed in a wide range of empirical studies and<lb/> reviews include Bernard et al. (2007) and Nordas et al. (2006).<lb/></table>

			<p>This paper presents the analysis completed under the third instalment of the project<lb/> examining comparative advantage from the perspective of factor services embodied in<lb/> traded outputs. It takes a closer look at the underlying forces in factor markets and how<lb/> they potentially drive Comparative Advantage.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper begins with a discussion of the factor content theory of comparative<lb/> advantage and briefly reviews the empirical literature examining factor content of trade<lb/> within this framework. It then moves to a review of the trends in resource accumulation<lb/> and utilisation among OECD and selected non–OECD economies, focusing on capital<lb/> and labour. The fourth section examines relative resource use and, relationship to<lb/> endowments and trade. We then apply these insights to the matter of relative wages with<lb/> an analysis of how the identified trends in productivity, resource endowments and trade<lb/> have played a role in changes in relative wages. The final section offers some conclusions<lb/> and areas of policy relevance.<lb/></p>

			<head>II. The Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international trade<lb/></head>

			<p>The Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international trade states that comparative advantage<lb/> is derived from differences in relative factor endowments across countries and relative<lb/> intensities with which factors are used across sectors. 2 A country will have an advantage,<lb/> vis a vis other countries, in producing goods in those sectors which use factors it holds in<lb/> relative abundance. <ref type="biblio">Vanek (1968)</ref> formalised the link between factors used in the<lb/> production of a country&apos;s goods and services and its trade by comparing the relationship<lb/> between those factors embodied in a country&apos;s production versus those embodied in its<lb/> consumption. This has become known as Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model of<lb/> international trade.<lb/></p>

			<p>The HOV model has been subject to extensive empirical scrutiny with an uneven<lb/> record of success. The problem is that the lack of a clearly differentiated framework<lb/> relating endowments and trade makes it impossible to test HOV against a well-specified<lb/> alternative. Thus, researchers have been focusing on what version of a constantly<lb/> evolving HOV model best fits the data. Starting with Leontief (1953) through <ref type="biblio">Trefler<lb/> (1995)</ref>, HOV failed most major empirical challenges. 3 <ref type="biblio">Trefler (1995)</ref> found that the<lb/> measured net factor content of trade using a HOV framework is essentially zero, calling<lb/> this the ―case of the missing trade‖. He then develops a specification that allows for home<lb/> bias in consumption and international technology differences and the model successfully<lb/> fits the data. However <ref type="biblio">Gabaix (1997)</ref> showed that this improved model is based on a set<lb/> of carefully chosen specifications and when the estimated parameters are tested to see if<lb/> they successfully reconcile the predicted with the measured factor content of trade, no<lb/> real improvement is observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Work following Trefler began to focus on why HOV models performed so badly.<lb/> Measurement error tended to be the most common explanation – factors are not well<lb/> defined or are not captured well enough in the value of trade (<ref type="biblio">Fisher and Marshall 2008</ref>);<lb/> significant aggregation bias existed in measures of trade used (Feenstra and Hanson<lb/> 2000); incorrect assumptions were being made regarding returns to scale (Antweiler and<lb/> 2.<lb/> The model was originally formulated by Heckscher (1919) and further developed by Ohlin (1933)<lb/> and formalised by Samuelson through a series of papers between 1948 and 1953. The model is<lb/> often also referred to as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model.<lb/> 3.<lb/> For an extensive review of empirical studies during this period see Leamer and Levinsohn (1995).<lb/> Trefler 2002) and difference in technology (early examples include Trefler and Zhu 2000,<lb/> Hakura 2001 and Davis and Weinstein 2001). Romalis <ref type="biblio">(2004)</ref> showed that transport costs<lb/> and monopolistic competition are important determinants of the structure of trade and<lb/> need to be incorporated into the HOV framework. In the end, what this body of work<lb/> showed was that by improving specifications and including more realistic elements of<lb/> trade, the HOV framework performs well.<lb/> One of the most active areas of investigation has been testing the HOV assumptions<lb/> regarding technology. A country&apos;s technology matrix is a measure of the units of inputs –<lb/> both primary inputs such as labour and capital and intermediate inputs that are produced<lb/> outputs of an industry – that are required to produce each unit of output, thus is an<lb/> indication of the technology, or production method, used within each sector in an<lb/> economy. Many early empirical studies had relied on one technology matrix (usually the<lb/> United States) measuring primary inputs only. Later studies made adjustments for<lb/> potential differences in the United States and ―other‖ potential technology matrices but<lb/> these were based on estimated deviations from a US base. A study by <ref type="biblio">Hakura (2001)</ref> is an<lb/> example of an early attempt to use directly observed technology matrices. By utilising<lb/> four OECD country matrices, this paper found significant improvement in the model&apos;s<lb/> performance. However, this does not provide a ―test‖ of any hypothesis of underlying<lb/> production (matrices fit the model as a matter of construction), and raised the question as<lb/> to how differences in these technology matrices occurred and if they systematically<lb/> related to fundamental characteristics (i.e. endowment structures) of countries in the<lb/> trading system (<ref type="biblio">Davis and Weinstein 2001</ref>).<lb/> With the publication of the OECD&apos;s Input-Output tables, the academic community<lb/> ―… dramatically improved our ability to test trade theory‖ (<ref type="biblio">Davis and Weinstein 2001</ref>).<lb/> Using these tables Davis and Weinstein found that allowing for Hicks-neutral<lb/> productivity differences, industry input usage strongly correlated with country factor<lb/> abundance, which had not held in conventional HOV model tests to date. 4 However, once<lb/> again, this modification was relative to a base technology matrix.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Davis and Weinstein (2003)</ref> observe that the study of factor content has ―become a<lb/> laboratory to test‖ ideas about how the elements of endowments, production,<lb/> consumption and trade fit together in a general equilibrium framework. They suggest that<lb/> while great progress has been made, a deeper consideration of intermediates inputs,<lb/> demand side issues (i.e. the differences in patterns of total domestic consumption of final<lb/> goods and services by a country, otherwise known as ―absorption‖), and the role of<lb/> aggregation biases is needed. This last point is echoed in <ref type="biblio">Feenstra and Hanson (2000)<lb/></ref> who found significant evidence that the factor content of exports differs systemically<lb/> from domestic production and that as disaggregation increases, the factor content of skill<lb/> intensity in US trade rises. Reimer (2006) and Trefler and Zhu (2010) are two attempts to<lb/> directly include traded intermediate inputs into the picture.<lb/> In the end, the HOV framework properly measured, has been shown to successfully<lb/> explain trade patterns through differences in factor scarcities, or on the flip side, factor<lb/> abundance, between economies. Thus, for our purposes, it remains a useful framework<lb/> for measurement and analysis. It is not the goal of this paper to reconcile theoretical<lb/> predictions from the model – there exists a wide body of literature having already done<lb/> this. Rather, we use this framework to examine measures of factor content across a<lb/></p>

			<head>III. Trends in factor endowments<lb/></head>

			<p>This section examines trends in accumulation of capital and labour and compares<lb/> changes in stocks with changes in the utilisation of these factors in goods and services<lb/> over time across OECD and Accession countries 5 (here after referred to as OECD), as<lb/> well as several Selected Emerging Markets (SEMs). 6<lb/></p>

			<head>Relative factor endowments<lb/></head>

			<p>There is wide variation both within and between the OECD and SEM groupings in<lb/> their relative endowments of capital and labour, as can be seen through measures of<lb/> variation. For OECD countries, the coefficient of variation for capital is 25.5% while it is<lb/> only 4.5% for labour, indicating a great disparity in capital stocks than labour stocks in<lb/> the region. SEMs show greater dissimilarity for both measures – 43.1% for capital and<lb/> 15.5% for labour – but the same higher values for capital than labour.<lb/> The OECD area is capital abundant, accounting for 80% of the capital available<lb/> among these countries in 2005. 7 The largest capital stocks are found in the United States<lb/> and Japan, followed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Korea and Italy<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>). Capital stocks grew at an average per annum rate of 4.5% in the OECD as a<lb/> whole during the 1990-2005 period (<ref type="table">Table A1</ref>), with the highest per annum growth rates<lb/> in Chile (10.4%) and Korea (7.7%). By comparison, in the SEM area capital is relatively<lb/> scarce. These countries held roughly 20% of total capital measured in 2005 with the<lb/> largest capital stocks held by China, India, and Brazil (<ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>). China shows an<lb/> especially rapid accumulation in capital stocks in the period 1995-2005 with a per annum<lb/> rate of 11.5%, followed by India with a rate of 9.2%. Stocks of capital in the SEM area<lb/> overall grew at a rate of 8.3% per annum, outpacing growth in the OECD.<lb/></p>

			<p>Conversely, labour is relatively abundant in the SEM area, which accounts for<lb/> roughly 70% of labour in the total sample. Within the OECD area, the largest stocks of<lb/> labour are found in the United States and Japan (<ref type="figure">Figure A2</ref>). The largest stocks in the<lb/> SEMs are in China, India and Indonesia (<ref type="figure">Figure A2</ref>). As with capital, labour stock grew<lb/> at disparate rates across these two groupings during the 1990-</p>

			<table>2005 period. In the OECD<lb/> 5.<lb/> The Accession grouping originally pertained to Chile, Estonia, Israel, Russia and Slovenia. Chile<lb/> formally became a member of the OECD on 7 May 2010 and Estonia, Israel and Slovenia were<lb/> invited to join 10 May 2010.<lb/> 6.<lb/> SEMs include the five enhanced engagement economies (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and<lb/> South Africa) as well as Argentina, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Singapore, and<lb/> Egypt where data is available.<lb/> 7<lb/> This is a share of the total capital stocks for the 38 countries for which data is available. Data was<lb/> not available for Poland, Turkey, the Slovak Republic, and the Czech Republic. The net capital<lb/> stocks are calculated from real GFCF series from the World Bank WDI. See data annex for<lb/> calculation details.<lb/> THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 9<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011<lb/> area the labour pool grew at a rate of 0.60% per annum while the SEMs increased at the<lb/> considerably faster annual rate of 2.1% (Table A1).<lb/> Decomposing by skill level reveals further differences in labour force characteristics<lb/> between the OECD area and SEMs (Figures A 3 and 4). 8 Overall, the 2005 total labour<lb/> force breaks down into a 10% share of skilled workers 9 , and 90% share of unskilled<lb/> workers. The OECD countries accounted for 56% of total skilled labour force, while the<lb/> SEMs held the remaining 44%. Stocks of skilled labour increased in the OECD area at a<lb/> per annum rate of 3.3% between 1990-2005; more slowly than the SEMS rate of 4.8%<lb/> per year in the same period. India and China held the bulk of the skilled labour stocks<lb/> among the SEMs.<lb/> The OECD&apos;s share of unskilled labour was 25%, while the SEMs accounted for the<lb/> remaining 75%. Unskilled labour stocks grew at a rate of 0.53% per annum in the OECD<lb/> area, only a third as fast as the rate of 1.7% per annum in SEMs during the 1990-2005<lb/> period. The US holds the largest stocks among the OECD countries while China and<lb/> India dominate the SEMs (<ref type="figure">Figure A4</ref>). Thus while OECD countries continue to hold<lb/> larger stocks of capital and skilled labour endowments, SEMs accumulation rates are<lb/> much higher for both, indicating that relative abundance may be changing over time. This<lb/> is especially true in capital and skilled labour and dominated by <ref type="biblio">China and India.<lb/></ref> As discussed in Section II, to understand how endowments play a role in a country&apos;s<lb/> trade composition, it is important to understand the way these factors are used. Thus, we<lb/> look at changes in the amount of capital per worker across these economies. The ratio of<lb/> capital stock per worker (k/l) provides a direct comparison of factor abundance. 10 <ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> A5</ref> shows the k/l ratios for two selected groupings of OECD countries. 11 In line with<lb/> observed changes in stocks of capital, k/l increased in all OECD countries, except Mexico<lb/> between 1990 and 2005. The highest values of k/l ratios corresponded to the countries<lb/> with the largest capital stocks; the United States and Japan (with Japan dominating) and<lb/> the largest increases in the k/l ratio in occurred in Chile and Korea (<ref type="figure">Figure A5</ref>).<lb/> By comparison (<ref type="figure">Figure A5</ref>), the capital per worker ratios in SEMs are small,<lb/> reflecting the smaller capital base relative to labour abundance in this grouping. Only<lb/> Argentina and Malaysia fall within a k/l range comparable to some OECD countries. The<lb/> k/l ratios in SEMs have remained relatively stable during the 1980-2005 period in China,<lb/> Indonesia, and India, while decreasing over time in Brazil. The largest increases in value<lb/> of k/l ratio occurred in Argentina, <ref type="biblio">Malaysia</ref> and Thailand.<lb/> 8.<lb/> The data for workforce by education level and gender comes from the IIASA and Vienna Institute<lb/> for Demography data sets for 1970-1995 and 2000-2050, further details on about these datasets can<lb/> be found in the data annex.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Skilled workers are those who have completed tertiary education.<lb/> 10.<lb/> Labour ratios are taken from the same source as labour stocks reported above. That is, the working<lb/> age population (15+) from the IIASA/VID Human Capital and Economic Growth Program. This<lb/> measure includes all available human capital, and does not distinguish economically active<lb/> population from those who do not participate. The same ratios were constructed using figures for<lb/> economically active labour force from the World Bank World Development Indicators, and the<lb/> resulting ratios demonstrated similar trends.<lb/> 11.<lb/> For ease of discussion, we show only selected OECD countries. For a complete table of ratios can be<lb/> found in the data annex.<lb/></table>

			<p>According to the HOV framework, these relative endowments are a major<lb/> determinant of economic activity in which countries will have a comparative advantage.<lb/> While the above analysis provides an indication of stocks of endowments available within<lb/> a country, it does not tell us how, or how much, of these stocks are actually utilised in<lb/> production. While standard HOV assumes full employment, (i.e. all stocks are fully<lb/> employed), we know this does not hold true, especially in specific periods of time. Thus,<lb/> to get an idea of how much capital and labour are used in the production process, we<lb/> examine their share in value added. To focus on the amount of capital being put in place,<lb/> we look at investment in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) as a share of value added<lb/> and examine the role of labour in production by looking at the ratio of total wage bill to<lb/> value added</p>

			<head>. 12 13<lb/></head>

			<p>The GFCF and total wage bill to value added ratios for all OECD countries and<lb/> SEMs 14 are shown in Figures A A6 and A7, respectively. These figures present the<lb/> average and standard deviation of the two measures for all countries for the 1988-2005<lb/> period as well as several sub-periods. 15 The figures depict opposing trends in the shares of<lb/> capital and labour to value added in total manufacturing with the mean share of capital to<lb/> value added increasing while the labour share declines slightly across periods. This<lb/> outcome implies that the capital intensity of manufacturing production increased across<lb/> the dataset. The overall increase in the divergence of the GFCF to value added ratio, as<lb/> measured by its standard deviation, comes mainly from the large increase in the post-<lb/>1997 time period. Prior to that, the deviations among countries appear to have been<lb/> declining. While a part of this finding can be attributed to an increase in country coverage<lb/> in the later period, the basic observation of an increase in the divergence of capital<lb/> utilisation across the economies examined holds. The increasing mean of capital as a<lb/> share of value added is in line with the growth of capital stocks observed across both<lb/> regions during this period.<lb/> Conversely, the mean wage bill to value added ratio decreased over the period. This<lb/> result is partially explained by the larger growth in value added in manufacturing relative<lb/> to the total wage bill but also is in line with trends in production fragmentation utilizing<lb/> an increasingly diverse pool of cheaper labour in Eastern European OECD and Emerging<lb/> Markets, as well as the decline in manufacturing employment overall in OECD area (<ref type="biblio">Pilat<lb/> et. al, 2006</ref>). The next section examines factor intensity of utilisation in manufacturing<lb/> across the two country groupings.<lb/> 12.<lb/> An alternative measure of capital used in the production process is to take the residual of the wage<lb/> bill/value added ratio, or 1-(wage bill/VA). However, as the mirror reflection of the wage bill share,<lb/> it provides little additional information about changing investment in fixed capital. Thus GFCF was<lb/> chosen as a better available capital proxy in measuring the factor&apos;s intensity in production. However,<lb/> we use GFCF/VA as a broad indication of the capital usage across all manufacturing activity within<lb/> an economy and thus it will not capture the expansion or contraction of capital in</p>

			<head>Trends in factor utilisation in OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>Within the OECD grouping, the average share of capital in value-added (VA) during<lb/> the 1988-2005 period was 14.5%, and on average has been declining at an annual rate of -<lb/>0.97% (<ref type="figure">Figure A6</ref>). 16 Driving this average decline is the fact that growth in GFCF is<lb/> outpacing value added growth in several OECD countries, for example in Mexico,<lb/> Iceland, Australia, Poland, New Zealand, the Slovak Republic and Hungary. The largest<lb/> decreases in the overall ratio are observed in Korea and Finland, but decreases were also<lb/> evident in other member countries including the Netherlands, France, Austria, Belgium,<lb/> Sweden, Canada, and Ireland. The faster growth in GFCF is not surprising given the<lb/> changes in economic structure that occurred in Eastern Europe during this period (i.e. the<lb/> transition to a market based economy in Poland), and the large investment program that<lb/> occurred in Iceland. 17<lb/></p>

			<p>Several trends explain the extent to which the overall decrease in capital intensity in<lb/> manufacturing in OECD countries appears to be inconsistent with the observed increases<lb/> in capital stocks per worker in these countries. First, the capital intensity numbers apply<lb/> only to the manufacturing sector, where the k/l ratios are reported across all economic<lb/> activity. We know that services are an increasingly important part of overall economic<lb/> activity, including trade, in many OECD economies. 18 To the extent that this sector has an<lb/> increasing k/l ratio, one would expect this to influence the overall k/l ratios reported for<lb/> these economies. Second, to the extent economies with large k/l ratios dominate reported<lb/> value added totals in the OECD groupings, they will again, unduly influence observed<lb/> outcomes (e.g. the contribution of the United States versus that of Hungary). Finally, the<lb/> deviation in the trends of stock accumulation and utilisation may be due to the relative<lb/> maturity of, and decreasing investment in, certain segments of manufacturing as<lb/> identified in Interim Report 1. 19<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure A7</ref> shows the trends in total wage bill in manufacturing as a share of value<lb/> added across the economies under examination during this period. The average of the<lb/> wage bill to value added ratio was 43%, although values for OECD countries in 2005<lb/> ranged from a low of 12% in Chile to a high of 65% in Denmark. Growth rate<lb/> calculations show a decline in the ratio at an average annual rate of -0.34%, with the<lb/> largest decreases in Japan, Korea, and Canada. This is primarily a reflection of the faster<lb/> growth rates in value added compared with wages across most OECD economies (with<lb/> the notable exception of Poland). The relatively small share of wage bill to value added in<lb/> Japan may be a reflection of its relatively (as shown above) high share of unskilled<lb/> workers (<ref type="figure">Figure A4</ref>). 20 The decrease in the wage bill to value added is consistent with<lb/> employment decreases in this sector as labour moved away from manufacturing toward<lb/> services and other sectors in the economy (<ref type="biblio">Pilat et al. 2006</ref>). The exceptions to this trend<lb/> are Luxembourg, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, France, Spain and the Russian<lb/></p>

			<head>Capital and labour utilisation in selected emerging markets<lb/></head>

			<p>GFCF to value added ratios for total manufacturing in SEMs are presented in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure A6</ref>. Increased investment activity and expansion of the manufacturing sector in<lb/> many of these countries is demonstrated by the three times larger average share of GFCF<lb/> to value added relative to the OECD country grouping. The average ratio is 49.3% with<lb/> an annual growth rate across these economies in excess of 11%. This growth trend<lb/> however, was not consistent throughout the SEMs. There appears to be a decline during<lb/> this period in India, Malaysia and Thailand. At the other extreme, China, Indonesia, and<lb/> Egypt experienced rapid growth in investment activity leading to GFCF to VA ratios over<lb/> 100%.<lb/> Wage bill to value added ratios (<ref type="figure">Figure A7</ref>) varied considerably across the SEM<lb/> grouping with Bangladesh and South Africa at the high end of the spectrum and China at<lb/> the low end. The larger ratios in the case of Bangladesh and South Africa were primarily<lb/> due to lower value added figures for manufacturing rather than to particularly high wage<lb/> bills. Wages to value added over the 1990-2005 time period averaged 24% and decreased<lb/> on average at a rate of -1.5% per annum. Significant differences are observed across<lb/> countries with decreases in India, South Africa, Egypt, and Singapore while Argentina,<lb/> Thailand, Malaysia and Bangladesh experienced an increase. The relative volatility of<lb/> values in this area indicates that changes in factor utilisations were occurring rapidly. The<lb/> decreasing share of Wage Bill in value added is, in part, a reflection of the increasing<lb/> capital intensity of manufacturing production in SEMs during this period. This is despite<lb/> the large increase in the stock of labour in the region. As value added increases across<lb/> most of these country&apos;s manufacturing sector and increasing labour stocks put downward<lb/> pressure on wages, we would expect to see a further decline in the overall ratio.<lb/> This section has shown that while the OECD countries have larger stocks of capital<lb/> and skilled labour, SEMs are accumulating these factors at a faster rate. We also see that<lb/> as a whole, capital per worker is increasing in the OECD while it remains flat across<lb/> many SEMs. This apparently inconsistent outcome could be due to the changing nature of<lb/> the output in the two regional groupings and the rapid accumulation of both resources in<lb/> the SEMs. As many OECD economies increase their output in services, they are adding<lb/> increasing amounts of investment to this sector thus influencing the overall capital to<lb/> labour ratios reported and potentially offsetting declining shares of capital formation in<lb/> value added in manufacturing. Also potentially influencing these results is the relative<lb/> change in demand for labour. For instance, in the OECD context, sectors that employ<lb/> (unskilled) workers and are capital-intensive (such as construction and light<lb/> manufacturing) are growing more slowly – or even contracting – shedding labour at a<lb/> faster rate than capital, thus raising the k/l ratio. Other sectors, such as services, which are<lb/> increasing their demand for (skilled) labour, are also adding invested capital, thus<lb/> influencing the overall increase in capital intensity observed here. We do observe,<lb/> however, that these patterns are not uniform across all OECD economies with more<lb/> newly industrialised members (such as Poland and Hungary) showing increasing shares<lb/> of capital in manufacturing value added.<lb/> Across the SEMs we observe increasing stocks of both capital and labour and this is<lb/> reflected in the relatively flat k/l ratios over the period. The shares of capital and labour in<lb/> value added varies across country and time, reflecting the relative changes in value added,<lb/> wages and returns to capital, thus complicating any straightforward conclusions to be<lb/> drawn from the underlying changes observed in capital and labour stocks. Next we<lb/> explore relative productivity of labour in order gain further insights into what these<lb/> changes in factor availability and utilisation imply for economic performance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to provide a broad consistent measure of labour productivity across the<lb/> economy as a whole, we look at output per worker, (using GDP as a proxy for output). 21<lb/> Productivity within and between the OECD and SEM country groupings vary widely (see<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure A8</ref>). Among OECD countries, the highest ratios of output per worker are found in<lb/> Luxembourg, Norway, Japan and the United States. At the lower end of the spectrum, we<lb/> find newer Eastern European member states, Turkey and Chile. During the 1990-2005<lb/> period, output per worker across the OECD increased at an average per annum rate of<lb/> 1.5% (<ref type="figure">Figure A8</ref>).<lb/> In SEMs, labour productivity remains significantly lower on average, with the<lb/> exceptions of Hong Kong and Singapore (<ref type="figure">Figure A8</ref>). Despite this considerably lower<lb/> base, productivity growth rates indicate that this is changing rapidly, at an average per<lb/> annum rate of 4.2%, nearly three times faster than the OECD area. The growth was not,<lb/> however, consistent throughout the grouping. Output per worker declined in Brazil and<lb/> South Africa during this period.<lb/> This comparison underscores the importance of taking into account how factors are<lb/> utilized and differences in technology of production in order to better understand how<lb/> factor abundance influences a country&apos;s comparative advantage. For example, it has been<lb/> shown that labour productivity increases with capital investment. 22 Thus, the fast growth<lb/> rates of labour productivity in SEMs may be a product of the rapid increase in capital<lb/> formation in these economies observed here. To see how these various, often competing<lb/> forces, have played out in trade patterns, we now turn to examining the measured factor<lb/> content of trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. Measuring factor content<lb/></head>

			<p>Total endowment stocks have been growing across both OECD and SEMs, with<lb/> SEMs experiencing faster growth across the board. Within the OECD, skilled labour<lb/> stocks grew 6.5 times faster than unskilled while the SEMs skilled labour growth rate<lb/> exceeded its unskilled rate at a slower rate (2.7 times). We also observe diminishing wage<lb/> bill to value added ratio, on average, across the OECD in manufacturing and a rise in<lb/> SEMs. However, as stated, this trend more likely reflects a decline in the value added in<lb/> manufacturing among OECD countries as a whole rather than an absolute decline in<lb/> labour usage. Indeed, labour productivity continues to grow at a robust rate among OECD<lb/> countries, especially in Korea, Estonia and Poland. There was also strong productivity<lb/> growth in China and Vietnam among the SEMs. We now look to see how these trends are<lb/> reflected in</p>

			<table>trade patterns.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Real GDP measures and total labour force were taken from the World Bank World Development<lb/> Indicators (2010).<lb/> 22.<lb/> There is a vast literature on the relationship between capital and labour productivity. See, for<lb/> instance, Romer (1990).<lb/> 14 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011<lb/> We begin our construction of the factor content of trade with the simple HOV model:<lb/> w<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> V<lb/> s<lb/> V<lb/> AT<lb/> F<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></table>

			<p>(1)<lb/> The first expression on the right hand side represents the standard HO specification:<lb/> the factor content of i&apos;s trade (F i ) is a function of the inputs used (A) times the country&apos;s<lb/> net exports T i . The final expression comes from Vanek (1968), who showed that the<lb/> measure of factor content should equal an economy&apos;s measure of factor abundance. In<lb/> this expression, V i is a measure of factor endowments in country i, V w is the measure of<lb/> world endowments and s i is the share of country i in world consumption. So, for example,<lb/> if a country is relatively abundant in labour, the factor content of trade would be positive<lb/> as the excess of what is produced with the country&apos;s labour supply, over what is<lb/> consumed of labour-intensive goods, is exported. Conversely, if a country is relatively<lb/> scarce in labour, the value would be negative, as it consumes a greater share of the<lb/> world&apos;s labour endowment.<lb/></p>

			<p>As pointed out in Trefler and Zhu (2010), the past decade has witnessed an<lb/> ―explosion‖ of research into the impact of international technology differences on<lb/> measuring the factor content of trade. However, they argue that this literature has failed to<lb/> properly account for differences in international technology and address the pivotal issue<lb/> of traded intermediate inputs. They put forth a theoretical model which does both,<lb/> providing a complete characterisation of the class of models that are implied by the<lb/> Vanek prediction of factor content of trade. This section relies upon this model to<lb/> construct a measure of factor content that is theoretically consistent and accounts for both<lb/> technological differences across country&apos;s production processes while explicitly including<lb/> trade in intermediate goods.<lb/></p>

			<p>The work presented here makes two major advancements over these existing<lb/> measures of factor content. First, as in Trefler and Zhu (2010), we rely on individual<lb/> countries&apos; technology matrices rather than the existing approach of using a single matrix<lb/> adjusted for production technology differentials. We then apply a definition of factor<lb/> content that measures the amount of factors used worldwide to produce a country&apos;s trade<lb/> flows, and we apply this across a set of five factors of production, including a breakout of<lb/> skilled and unskilled labour. Thus we construct a more complete factor requirements<lb/> matrix for a country&apos;s trade by allowing for differentiated production processes including<lb/> those inputs used in producing intermediate inputs overseas (<ref type="biblio">Deardorff, 1982</ref>). Finally,<lb/> we apply this approach to different time periods to observe how the factor content of<lb/> trade has changed. By comparing the equations derived without directly accounting for<lb/> intermediate inputs with those that do, we can analyse the role of intermediate inputs in<lb/> trade and the determination of a country&apos;s comparative advantage. 23<lb/></p>

			<head>Data<lb/></head>

			<p>To implement this approach, it is important we have access to input-output data for as<lb/> complete and consistent a set of countries as possible. While the OECD input-output<lb/> tables are a consistent and up-to-date set of information, they cover only a few countries<lb/> outside the OECD and are limited in their factor input coverage. The GTAP database also<lb/> provides a consistent measure of trade flows and input data but covers a larger number</p>

			<table>of<lb/> 23.<lb/> See the Technical Appendix for a more detailed explanation of our approach to measuring factor<lb/> content.<lb/> countries globally, as well as a breakdown of skilled and unskilled labour. 24 We use three<lb/> versions of the database, namely GTAP versions 5, 6 and 7 which correspond to base<lb/> years of 1997, 2001 and 2004, respectively. The input-output tables contain five primary<lb/> factors of production: land, unskilled labour, skilled labour, capital and natural resources.<lb/></table>

			<p>Land is defined in GTAP as an agriculture-specific resource and is used only in<lb/> production in these sectors. Natural resources are associated with extraction industries<lb/> and are a factor input for the sectors fishery, forestry, coal, oil, gas and other mining.<lb/> Labour is divided into skilled and unskilled based on the International Labour<lb/> Organisations (ILO) classification. 25<lb/></p>

			<head>How has factor usage within a country changed over time?<lb/></head>

			<p>As discussed in Section III, capital utilisation has increased and overall labour<lb/> productivity rates rose over the 1990 – 2005 time period, especially in the emerging<lb/> OECD and SEM economies. In this section, we apply the factor content of trade<lb/> definition to explore the relative uses of these factor endowments and how they have<lb/> changed over time.<lb/> To examine a country&apos;s relative factor abundance, that is each endowment relative to<lb/> other endowments within a country, at a point in time, we normalise each factor by its<lb/> content in consumption and compare across the various factors (<ref type="biblio">Muriel and Terra, 2009</ref>).<lb/> For example, the content of skilled labour in net exports is higher (lower) than the factor<lb/> content of capital if skilled labour is relatively more abundant (less abundant), when the<lb/> factor contents are normalised by domestic consumption. We can also restate these<lb/> values, measuring factor abundance by income rather than consumption, adjusting the<lb/> value to take account of the trade balance as in Bowen and Sveikaukas (1992). Both<lb/> measures provide a relative value for factor abundance with respect to other factors<lb/> within a single country. 26<lb/></p>

			<p>We calculate these relative values for each country in the sample for the three time<lb/> periods: namely 1997, 2001 and 2004 and rank the factors to determine the relative<lb/> abundance as revealed by the country&apos;s trade position, and examine how this has changed<lb/> over time. The relative factor abundance values and their rankings are presented for<lb/> OECD and SEM countries in Tables A2 and A3, respectively. 27<lb/></p>

			<p>The two tables present three pieces of information: (1) the calculated factor<lb/> abundance measure for each of the five resources, relative to the other resources within<lb/> each country; (2) the rankings for each of these factors of production relative to the other<lb/> factors for each of the three years; and (3) the standard deviation of the factor abundance<lb/> measures for each year. As shown in the table, in all three years, the relative rankings for<lb/> most OECD economies have remained consistent which means there have been no<lb/> significant changes in relative factor endowments within each of these economies in the<lb/></p>

			<table>24.<lb/> For complete documentation of the GTAP database see website<lb/> www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp. Summary details of the data used in our<lb/> analysis, including on individual input-output tables, can be found in the Data Annex.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Completed documentation of the methods used to split total labour payments into skilled and<lb/> unskilled can be found in Liu, et al. (1998a, b).<lb/> 26.<lb/> See Technical Annex for details on calculating relative factor usage measures.<lb/> 27.<lb/> We report rankings using adjusted income shares. The rankings using consumption shares were<lb/> qualitatively similar and are available upon request.<lb/> time period examined. Most OECD economies consistently rank skilled labour and<lb/> capital at the top of their relative resource endowments as measured by the factor services<lb/> employed. The rankings for Mexico, Chile, Hungary, Poland and Turkey show a greater<lb/> reliance on land and natural resources. Australia also shows a high reliance on natural<lb/> resources, but unlike the other countries listed, capital and skilled labour are also<lb/> significant factors. Within their own resource structure, capital ranks first in Austria,<lb/> France, Germany, Italy and New Zealand for each of the three years examined. Denmark,<lb/> Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States all consistently rank<lb/> skilled labour as number one, relative to their other resource use. These countries show a<lb/> high use of labour in general, with unskilled labour ranking second.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Despite the relative stability in rankings of endowments in OECD countries, there<lb/> have been some noteworthy developments among member states. Into the 2000s, both<lb/> skilled and unskilled labour moved up in ranking over capital for Australia. New Zealand<lb/> experienced a small change in its endowment rankings with the role of natural resources<lb/> declining and unskilled labour increasing. Korea shows an increase in the prominence of<lb/> capital in place of unskilled labour while Japan&apos;s unskilled labour and capital both<lb/> increase their rank relative to the use of their other resources, namely skilled labour. The<lb/> increasingly significant ranking of unskilled labour in Japan (as foreshadowed by their<lb/> large stock of unskilled endowment) is reflected in employment growth patterns. Between<lb/> 1990 and 2009, the only employment sectors which enjoyed consistent positive growth in<lb/> Japan were labourers, service workers and professional and technical workers (Statistical<lb/> Bureau Office of Japan 2010). The first two categories, which experienced the fastest<lb/> growth, are dominated by unskilled workers. Spain, Poland and Hungary all saw their top<lb/> ranked resource move from land in 1997 to capital by 2004.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Land and natural resources hold the dominant positions in the SEMs for each of the<lb/> three time periods (<ref type="table">Table A3</ref>). As with the OECD, the rankings show little movement<lb/> over this time. Exceptions are Brazil and South Africa who both experienced a shift away<lb/> from land and resource extraction to a greater reliance on capital and labour. In both these<lb/> economies, capital was ranked the highest in 2004. All countries examined show<lb/> relatively low rankings in the use of skilled labour.<lb/> A notable difference between the two country groupings is in the standard deviation<lb/> of the abundance measure. This measure provides some insights in the changing<lb/> endowment structure and the relative intensities with which resources are used within<lb/> each economy examined. The more dominant one or two resources are in terms of their<lb/> relative intensity, the greater the spread in values among the resources and the greater the<lb/> standard deviation. Thus, it is interesting to see if these values have changed over the<lb/> three time periods examined.<lb/></p>

			<p>We see countries like France, the United Kingdom and Germany with small and fairly<lb/> constant measures of standard deviation, implying the relative intensity of factor usage<lb/> has changed little over the three time periods. Greece and Russia exhibit large standard<lb/> deviations implying dominance in a specific resource – in Russia&apos;s case natural resources.<lb/> Greece&apos;s standard deviation declined significantly in 2004 as capital and labour began to<lb/> play a greater role in its economic activities diversifying away from natural resources.<lb/> Interestingly enough, the United States shows a slightly increasing standard deviation<lb/> among its factor measures while its actual rankings remain stable. This is due to an<lb/> increasing use of labour relative to that of capital. Mexico and Chile, on the other hand,<lb/> experienced a decline in their standard deviation. For Mexico, there was a relatively small<lb/> change in the use of labour and capital across its economic activities while for Chile the<lb/> use of labour increased relative to that of capital. What is interesting for Chile is that<lb/> while the relative rankings of the two labour and capital measures do not change, the<lb/> relative abundance measure shows a convergence in the intensity of usage.<lb/> Among most of the SEMs, there is much greater variation within each country&apos;s<lb/> resource ranking as shown by the standard deviations. The exceptions are Brazil, which<lb/> has the lowest standard deviation of all economies reported here, and South Africa whose<lb/> measure substantially declined in 2004. This implies that Brazil has employed the five<lb/> resources measured here with relatively equal intensity in each of the three time periods.<lb/> Thailand&apos;s standard deviation has increased as evidenced by the large and increasing<lb/> factor abundance measure for land. This would imply that agricultural products are taking<lb/> a larger role while capital usage shows a relative decline. India remains dominated by its<lb/> land usage as does Indonesia. However, Indonesia&apos;s factor abundance measures for land<lb/> and natural resources have declined somewhat indicating a potential increase in the<lb/> diversity of other resources used.<lb/> What the above discussion highlights is a relatively stable factor abundance story for<lb/> most of the advanced OECD countries. 28 However, the dynamics of changing market<lb/> structure are evident, as illustrated by the changing ranks and growing dispersion of<lb/> relative factor abundance measures in, for example, the United States and South Korea.<lb/> Chile, Mexico and Poland show decreasing variation among measures of factor<lb/> abundance which could imply, as revealed by factor abundance measures, established<lb/> production patterns. Turkey, on the other hand, shows increasing dispersion potentially<lb/> indicating a changing relative factor base.<lb/></p>

			<p>SEMs, for the three time periods examined, show a relatively consistent factor<lb/> ranking, still heavily dependent on land (i.e. agricultural) and natural resources. However,<lb/> movement to capital goods can be observed in the case of Brazil and to a lesser extent,<lb/> Indonesia. Most countries continue to show a factor endowment story related to<lb/> agriculture and natural resources.<lb/> Overall, these results are consistent with those observed in factor endowment trends.<lb/> The stability in both groups of countries&apos; rankings is a possible reflection of the large<lb/> established factor stocks in these economies. That is, the large share of capital and skilled<lb/> labour stocks in the OECD and the unskilled labour stocks in the SEMs. However, the<lb/> small shifts in rankings and the changing abundance measures, along with their standard<lb/> deviations, show an emerging trend of diversification into using capital and skilled labour<lb/> for SEMs and a subtle shift in the OECD endowment usage as well.<lb/></p>

			<head>How has factor content of trade changed over time?<lb/></head>

			<figure>We calculate a measure of factor content for each of the five GTAP factors for the<lb/> three time periods (1997, 2001 and 2004) based on a derivation of the basic equation<lb/> shown in (1) and presented in Figures A 9 and 10. 29 Positive values are an indication of a<lb/> 28.<lb/> While we are able to look at a greater level of factor disaggregation than previous studies, our<lb/> measures are still quite broad. It is to be expected that if we could conduct this analysis at an even<lb/> more refined level of inputs (e.g. different types of skilled labour) we may see different patterns<lb/> emerging.<lb/> 29.<lb/> The values at the economy-wide level were scaled by relative income measures to ease comparisons.<lb/> The authors wish to thank Frank Van Tongeren for providing a crucial piece of code to perform the<lb/> calculations.<lb/> comparative advantage as implied by exporting abundant factors of production, while a<lb/> negative value reflects a negative factor content of trade.<lb/></figure>

			<p>For ease of discussion, we present a measure of factor content of trade for three<lb/> factors: skilled labour, unskilled labour and capital, for OECD economies (<ref type="figure">Figure A9</ref>)<lb/> and SEMs (<ref type="figure">Figure A10</ref>). As expected, most of the OECD countries show a deficit in<lb/> unskilled labour (panel 1). The notable exceptions are Japan and Korea who have<lb/> surpluses in each of the three years, as do, albeit to a lesser extent, Australia, Chile,<lb/> Finland, Ireland, Slovenia, Switzerland, Estonia, Turkey and the United States. This<lb/> outcome is consistent with the rankings of relative factor abundance presented in the<lb/> previous discussion. For example, the United States and Japan had the highest OECD<lb/> stocks of unskilled labour and both show labour in general (skilled and unskilled) as a<lb/> consistently ranked highly utilised resource relative to the other resources used. A notable<lb/> exception is Korea. Its unskilled labour stocks were not significantly higher than other<lb/> OECD countries, showing a trade deficit in this factor (France, for example) yet its<lb/> relative factor usage ranking for unskilled labour was behind both land and capital in<lb/> 2001 and 2004 (<ref type="table">Table A2</ref>). However, broadly speaking these results do reflect the<lb/> patterns observed in the factor endowment trends noted in section III.<lb/></p>

			<p>The highly positive values for both Japan and the United States in its factor content of<lb/> skilled workers shown in the following panel is again a reflection of the abundance of<lb/> labour reported for these countries. France, Italy and Germany, among others, are all<lb/> shown to have deficits in their factor content of trade in skilled workers. This is in fact<lb/> surprising as most OECD countries have a relative abundance of skilled workers vis-a-vis<lb/> the rest of the world and skilled labour ranks as Italy and Germany&apos;s second most<lb/> intensively used resource (<ref type="table">Table A2</ref>). However, where these countries show a consistent<lb/> comparative advantage is in the area of capital, where all three have relatively large<lb/> positive values (France excepting in 2004). Mexico&apos;s increase in capital stock and its<lb/> associated increase in relative usage rank are reflected in its positive factor content of<lb/> trade for capital. This trend is observed despite Mexico&apos;s falling k/l ratio which is more a<lb/> reflection of faster labour growth than declines in capital stock. While the measure<lb/> experienced a downturn in 2004, it was strongly positive in 1997 and 2001. Other<lb/> countries with factor content surpluses in capital include New Zealand, Ireland and Chile<lb/> and the newly emerging OECD economies of Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and<lb/> Turkey.<lb/> The United States and the United Kingdom are shown to have a negative factor<lb/> content of trade in capital in each time period examined. This could be due to the<lb/> ―de-industrialisation‖ of these economies as identified in Interim Report 1. The increasing<lb/> use of resources in the production of services is something that was observed throughout<lb/> the OECD but especially so in countries such as the United Kingdom and United States.<lb/> As further noted in Interim Report 1, the share of manufactured exports from the top<lb/> OECD exporters has been declining over the period 1990-2007. Finally, the United States<lb/> and United Kingdom were among the lowest ranked OECD economies in measures of<lb/> GFCF to value added in manufacturing (<ref type="figure">Figure A6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The three panels in <ref type="figure">Figure A10</ref> look at the same measures for the SEMs. As expected,<lb/> almost all show a comparative advantage in unskilled labour judging by the factor content<lb/> of their trade. Some countries, Thailand, Russia and South Africa, show a negative factor<lb/> content of trade in more recent years, but for South Africa and Russia, this is not a<lb/> consistent pattern and for Thailand, it is decidedly smaller in recent years. Neither South<lb/> Africa nor Thailand (information was not available for Russia) have large stocks of<lb/> unskilled labour with respect to other SEMs (<ref type="figure">Figure A4</ref>). Again, as expected, all show a<lb/> negative balance in skilled labour with the exception of Brazil and Malaysia who both<lb/> show a positive factor content of trade in this resource in more recent years (2001 and<lb/> 2004). Interestingly, relative stocks of skilled labour with respect to other SEMs were no<lb/> higher in these two economies (<ref type="figure">Figure A3</ref>) and skilled labour actually ranked fifth in<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s relative factor usage (<ref type="table">Table A3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Another interesting observation can be seen in the patterns revealed when looking at<lb/> capital. All of the SEMs show at least one period with positive factor content for capital.<lb/> This implies that the trade balance in goods using capital is positive and thus these<lb/> countries have a comparative advantage in this resource. A possible explanation for this<lb/> pattern is the growing industrial production base of these economies, especially those in<lb/> Southeast Asia. As observed in Interim Report 1, OECD countries are moving toward<lb/> services and away from traditional ―capital intensive‖ manufacturing and the slack is<lb/> being picked up by SEMs. As these countries increase their inflow of FDI and expand<lb/> their own higher value-added manufacturing processes, the capital content of their trade<lb/> should necessarily increase. We saw this by the increased rank of capital usage in some of<lb/> these economies, China especially, implying growing participation of relatively capital<lb/> intensive goods in their trade.<lb/></p>

			<p>These outcomes are consistent with the growth in capital stocks in SEMs and a slower<lb/> investment rate among OECD countries observed above (<ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>). Further, we see that<lb/> the majority of OECD countries which have an increase ranking in capital factor usage<lb/> are emerging OECD economies like Poland, Mexico and Estonia while only a few SEMs<lb/> show an increased ranking of capital (China, Thailand and South Africa). However, the<lb/> increase in relative ranking for China is small, indicating that their factor usage is still<lb/> dominated by other factors, i.e. labour.<lb/> When we observe, however, the relative contribution of labour and capital as<lb/> measured in countries&apos; k/l ratios, we see that capital still dominates among OECD<lb/> countries. What this implies is that while the production base is shifting, it is shifting<lb/> slowly. OECD countries still employ a relatively large share of capital reflective of their<lb/> large capital stocks while SEMs employ larger shares of labour, reflective of their stocks.<lb/> However, among those sectors seeing the most growth in each region (i.e. services in<lb/> OECD and manufacturing in SEMs) we see the potential reversal of these resource uses.<lb/> Overall, the base is dominated by capital in the OECD with changes in labour, while the<lb/> base is dominated by labour in SEMs and capital is driving the change. This may also<lb/> imply something about the nature of traded versus non-traded goods. Overall, according<lb/> to resource rankings, the relative use of labour by OECD countries has remained fairly<lb/> stable while capital has increased. However, the factor content of resources implies these<lb/> rankings will change to reflect a declining use of capital among traded goods, and a<lb/> possible reflection of the shift from manufacturing to services.<lb/></p>

			<head>What role has intermediate inputs played in measuring factor content of trade?<lb/></head>

			<p>As stated above, traditional measures of factor content have tended to be based on<lb/> primary factor services embodied in the trade of final goods and services. We aim to<lb/> expand this measure to include the factor services embodied in intermediate inputs –<lb/> imported as well as locally sourced -as well. Thus, equation (1) becomes:<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> k<lb/> 1<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> k<lb/> i<lb/> k<lb/> T<lb/> )<lb/> B<lb/> (I<lb/> D<lb/> F<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (2)<lb/></formula>

			<p>where F is the factor content of input k in country i; D is the vector of factor inputs k,<lb/> i&apos;s intermediate inputs matrix B is adjusted to fully account for imported intermediates, as<lb/> outlined in the technical appendix, and T is the net trade vector in country i.<lb/></p>

			<p>We can further examine the trends in factor content derived from the traditional<lb/> HOV specification by comparing the outcomes of an equation which accounts for a<lb/> country&apos;s use of resources embodied in its intermediate inputs with one that does not.<lb/> This analysis is discussed below. While we developed results at the general country level,<lb/> we report here those outcomes pertaining to individual sector outcomes. 30<lb/></p>

			<p>Including a correctly specified measure of traded intermediates is crucial to a more<lb/> accurate measurement of factor content. In order to better understand the relative<lb/> importance of intermediate trade we examine the factor content of trade with and without<lb/> imported intermediate inputs for China and the United States. 31<lb/></p>

			<head>China<lb/></head>

			<p>We examine the trends in factor content across sectors for three factors of production:<lb/> skilled labour, unskilled labour and capital. Given that most imported intermediate shares<lb/> are in the manufacturing sector, we begin our analysis in this area. In addition, because<lb/> we are comparing with the United States and the changing nature of the two economies<lb/> stresses the role of services, we include this sector as well.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure A11 shows the factor content of Chinese trade for skilled labour in three time<lb/> periods: 1997, 2001 and 2004. The bars represent the factor content of trade as defined by<lb/> equation without explicitly accounting for intermediate inputs and the dots are defined<lb/> with intermediate inputs. While measures without show a consistently negative balance<lb/> across both sectors and time periods, there are significant difference when accounting for<lb/> intermediates.<lb/></figure>

			<p>When examining skilled labour, accounting for intermediate inputs in the calculation<lb/> of factor content reduces the observed deficit, or creates a small surplus, in almost every<lb/> sector. Notable exceptions are the chemical and rubber sector (crp) and the trade (retail<lb/> and wholesale, trd) sector in 2001. Thus, for example, it would appear that the inputs<lb/> which China accesses from the rest of the world are more skill intensive in the production<lb/> of electronics and other manufacturing goods. Across the sectors of textiles (tex), wearing<lb/> apparel (wap) and leather (lea), the same phenomenon is observed, although to a lesser<lb/> extent. An outlier is the other services sector consisting of public administration and<lb/> government services (osg). Here, especially in 1997 and 2001, we see a large surplus<lb/> reduced to a small deficit in 1997, balanced trade in 2001 when accounting for the factor<lb/> content of intermediate inputs. This would imply that China was importing intermediate<lb/> inputs that are non-highly skill intensive, or at least less skill intensive than non-traded<lb/> intermediate inputs. By 2004, this trend had reversed itself and including intermediate<lb/> imports leads to a slightly larger surplus, implying that more skilled labour was now<lb/> being sourced internationally.<lb/> Turning to unskilled labour, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure A12</ref>, the pattern of comparative<lb/> advantage appears to be changing regardless of intermediate inputs (although these inputs<lb/> 30.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 2 in the Data Annex provides a list of sectors covered.<lb/> 31.<lb/> While similar comparisons are available for all covered countries, as two of the largest trading<lb/> nations, we focus our discussion on these two countries.<lb/> impact the results as well). In 1997 and 2001, we observe surpluses in sectors using<lb/> unskilled labour (before adjusting for intermediate inputs). These include construction<lb/> (cns), chemicals and rubber, non-metallic minerals (nmm, such as cement, lime and<lb/> concrete), trade and other business services (obs). By 2004 none of the sectors show a<lb/> surplus in unskilled labour.</table>

			<p>This is consistent with the decline in the relative abundance<lb/> ranking for unskilled labour in China between these two time periods. However, once we<lb/> account for the factors embodied in intermediate inputs, we observe a number of strong<lb/> surplus sectors. These include electronics (ele), other manufacturing (omf), textiles,<lb/> wearing apparel, leather and lumber (lum). Again, this could be an indication of China&apos;s<lb/> own increasing use of production outsourcing, especially in the textiles and electronics<lb/> sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Capital shows a different story to that of labour (<ref type="figure">Figure A13</ref>). In most of the sectors,<lb/> in all three time periods, China has a small surplus in capital, and we see this trend<lb/> strengthening in 2004. However, as distinct from labour, including intermediates creates a<lb/> smaller surplus and even a deficit in many sectors including paper products (ppp),<lb/> petroleum and coke (p_c), chemical and rubber, iron and steel (i_s), motor vehicles<lb/> (mvh), other machinery and equipment (ome) and trade. By 2004 many services sectors<lb/> see shrinking surpluses when intermediate inputs are accounted for, including finance and<lb/> banking (ofi) and other business services. As stated above, this implies that most<lb/> imported intermediate inputs are more capital intensive than other inputs while imported<lb/> intermediate inputs into chemicals and machinery and equipment, for example, are less<lb/> capital intensive in 2004. While we do not have detailed source information for<lb/> intermediate inputs to China, looking at total imports provides some explanation. Japan<lb/> remains a major source of imports across four of the five sectors in 2004. Taiwan and<lb/> Korea also contribute significantly to imports of chemicals and rubber and other<lb/> machinery and equipment while Hong Kong is by far the largest supplier of imports in the<lb/> trade sector, all sectors with implied higher capital input in imported than domestic<lb/> intermediates. However, among those sectors which showed lower capital intensity in<lb/> imports – electronics and other manufacturing – Malaysia, India and Thailand were also<lb/> significant sources of imports.<lb/></p>

			<head>The United States<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure A14</ref> shows the same three sets of graphs for the United States, that is, the<lb/> evolution of surplus/deficit sectors with and without intermediate inputs for skilled<lb/> labour. Across all three time periods the United States shows a significant surplus in<lb/> skilled labour in the services sector with other business services showing particular<lb/> strength in 2004. Other sectors, such as motor vehicles, other machinery and equipment,<lb/> chemicals and rubber, construction and trade had shown relatively strong surpluses with<lb/> smaller values in 2004.<lb/> Intermediate inputs make less of a difference in the overall results of the<lb/> United States data over each successive period. Indeed, by 2004 the only sectors outside<lb/> services that experience a relatively large shift is other machinery and equipment and, to a<lb/> lesser extent, chemicals and rubber. These small changes are in contrast to <ref type="biblio">China</ref> who<lb/> shows large changes in each time period. While this does not indicate that the United<lb/> States has fewer imported intermediate inputs than China (indeed the many cases the<lb/> United States imports more), rather that the resource profile in the inputs are more similar<lb/> to those sourced from within the United States.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Much the same pattern holds for unskilled labour in that there are small differences<lb/> with and without intermediate inputs in sectors outside services (<ref type="figure">Figure A15</ref>). Here,<lb/> however, many of the sectors go from large surpluses to balanced trade, implying that the<lb/> United States imports unskilled-intensive intermediates. Sectors that maintain their<lb/> surplus, albeit at a lower level include other transport equipment (otn), banking and<lb/> business and government services sectors. Again, this implies that the United States trade<lb/> in goods using unskilled labour is generally in balance with the exception of a few<lb/> sectors, and trade in intermediate inputs have only a limited role to play in this story.<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted above, the role of capital in US trade is not as large as one would have<lb/> expected a priori (<ref type="figure">Figure A16</ref>). Indeed, across the manufacturing sectors there are no<lb/> significant surplus sectors in any of the three time periods examined with most of these<lb/> sectors remaining more or less in balance. However, there are significant deficits across<lb/> many of the services sectors. In 2004, the deficit in other business services sector was<lb/> particularly large. Indeed, all of the service sectors (with the exception of the transport<lb/> sectors) show deficits in each period. Thus, it would appear that these sectors are driving<lb/> the deficit in capital observed for the United States in <ref type="figure">Figure A9</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>When adjusting for intermediate inputs, the deficits in the services sector change<lb/> considerably. Most of the deficit sectors move to a balanced trade or even surplus as in<lb/> the case of other business and government services. One of the issues with the<lb/> measurement of capital is that we are unable to determine what part of the imported<lb/> intermediate goods are made with the exporting country&apos;s capital from that which may be<lb/> produced with US capital employed overseas. Thus, while it appears that the United<lb/> Kingdom is a net importer of capital in these sectors, it may be that a large part of the<lb/> capital is owned by US companies. Grossman and <ref type="biblio">Rossi-Hansberg (2009)</ref> show that trade<lb/> between US companies and their foreign subsidiaries accounted for 47% of US imports in<lb/> 2005. Further they show that US imports in ―Business, Professional and Technical<lb/> Services‖ (which overlaps with our other business services) grew in real terms by more<lb/> than 66% between 1997 and 2004.<lb/> From this analysis we can see what has been a growing acknowledgement in trade<lb/> circles: intermediate trade matters. Further, we see that it affects factors differently. Thus<lb/> if policy is to be effective, it must rely on analysis which includes intermediate trade and<lb/> the embodied factor services in this trade, and includes it in a meaningful way,<lb/> i.e. measured in terms of value added. How this information can be used in the formation<lb/> of trade policy will be discussed in more detail in the fourth paper of this series.<lb/> However, before we move to that, we provide some insights into how this information<lb/> plays a role in analysing a widespread phenomenon across both OECD and SEM<lb/> economies: that of wage inequality.<lb/></p>

			<head>V. Relationship between trade and relative wages<lb/></head>

			<p>The developments in factor content of trade are intertwined with factor returns<lb/> because the latter function as signals about resource allocation and the former about<lb/> utilization within a country. Trade literature analyzing factor content links the HOV<lb/> model to the factor price equalisation (FPE) theorem because equalisation of marginal<lb/> factor returns would be the expected outcome when two countries with identical<lb/> technologies but with different factor endowments, producing the same goods or services<lb/> engage in free trade. 32 The trade literature succinctly summarized in Freeman (1995) has<lb/> investigated whether factor price equalisation occurs empirically across countries. The<lb/> main conclusions are that factor price equalisation is a rare occurrence because of its<lb/> demanding conditions. These conditions include: identical technology and tastes; similar<lb/> ranking of sectors by skilled to unskilled and capital to labour ratios at all prices; absence<lb/> of scale effects; and incomplete specialisation by all countries, that is, all countries<lb/> produce the full set of traded goods. As a consequence of the breakdown in FPE, we need<lb/> to identify other forces that could explain factor return differentials. This is important<lb/> because these differentials are at the heart of the North-South development gap; they are<lb/> also critical in explaining differing equilibrium growth paths across nations, and can<lb/> exacerbate trade frictions (<ref type="biblio">Trefler, 1993</ref>). Moreover, the growing importance of trade of<lb/> intermediate goods observed above can have a potentially large impact on factor returns,<lb/> in particular, wages, through production fragmentation and offshoring.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Using data available in Freeman and Oostendorp (2000), we examine the evolution of<lb/> real wages and wage inequality for a sample of OECD and non-OECD economies.<lb/> Freeman and Oostendorp standardized the International Labor Organization&apos;s (ILO)<lb/> ―October Inquiry‖ survey to allow for wage comparisons across countries, industries, and<lb/> occupations. 33 The resulting dataset covers approximately 130 countries and around<lb/> 161 occupations for the years 1983-2003. Details can be found in the Data Annex.<lb/> The data in the sample allows compensation to be disaggregated by industries and<lb/> occupations to identify those having the lowest and highest wages. Figures A17 and 18<lb/> present the frequencies of industries and occupations which reported the lowest<lb/> compensation in the sample. The occupation Room attendant or Chambermaid in the<lb/> Restaurant and hotels industry received the lowest wage about 13% of the time across all<lb/> countries. Other occupations receiving low compensation were Labourer, Field crop farm<lb/> worker, Cash desk cashier, Sewing machine operator, and Waiter. The corresponding<lb/> industries for these occupations were Textile (spinning, weaving and finishing), Retail<lb/> trade (grocery), and Agricultural production. The occupations receiving the highest<lb/> compensation across all countries were Air transport pilot, General physician, Air traffic<lb/> controller, and Chemical engineer. The corresponding industries were Air transport and<lb/> its supporting services; Medical and dental services; and Crude petroleum and natural gas<lb/> production. Figures A19 and 20 present these occupations and industries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>We next identify the industry/occupation breakdown for OECD and SEM economies.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figures</ref> A21 and 22 present the lowest paying industries and occupations for OECD<lb/> 32.<lb/> The Factor Price Equalisation Theorem states trade in goods has the ability to equalize factor prices<lb/> where trade in goods is a proxy for trade in factors of production.<lb/> 33.<lb/> This circumvents measurement problems such as different reporting units, quality of reporting<lb/> sources, wage levels, and other issues, providing the use of a unique standardised dataset.<lb/> countries. The occupation Room attendant or Chambermaid was the lowest compensated<lb/> occupation and the industry was Restaurant and hotels. Other industries receiving the<lb/> lowest compensation were Retail trade (grocery); Agricultural production (fieldworkers);<lb/> and Manufacturing of wearing apparel. Note that in our analysis of factor content, we<lb/> observe some of the most significant shifts in trade positions from including intermediate<lb/> inputs were in the Textile (including wearing apparel) industry. Figures A23 and 24<lb/> present the reverse, the highest compensated industries and occupations, in the OECD<lb/> countries. Air transport pilot, General physician, Air traffic controller, and Chemical<lb/> engineer were again the highest compensated occupations. The industries were Air<lb/> transport and supporting services, Medical and dental services, and Manufacturing of<lb/> industrial chemicals.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure A25</ref> shows that Labourer, Field crop farm worker, Plantation worker, and<lb/> Room attendant or Chambermaids were the lowest compensated occupations in the<lb/> SEMs. The lowest compensated industries were Textiles, Education services, Printing,<lb/> Publishing and related industries, and Restaurants and hotels (<ref type="figure">Figure A26</ref>). Finally, the<lb/> occupations which registered the highest compensation were Air transport pilot, General<lb/> physician, Accountant, and Air traffic controller. Those industries paying the highest<lb/> wages included Air transport, Medical and dental services, Construction, and Banking<lb/> (Figures A 27 and 28). Notably, none of these sectors (with the exception of Textiles)<lb/> figures prominently in SEMs factor content of trade. This anecdotal evidence provides<lb/> little incentive to suspect a strong relationship between trade and wages.<lb/></p>

			<p>To more rigorously examine the influence of domestic and international wage setting<lb/> mechanisms, we use the concept of factor price equalisation (<ref type="biblio">Freeman 1995</ref>). As stated,<lb/> the conditions for factor price equalisation are demanding and, therefore, observing wage<lb/> convergence is rare. Moreover, factor price equalisation implies domestic labour market<lb/> policies have little or no effect on the level of wages. Countries with larger labour forces<lb/> would have an advantage in setting wage levels and could exert undue influence in<lb/> determining modifications on wage levels. The exceptions to this potential influence are<lb/> occupations found exclusively in the non-tradable sector which would not be affected by<lb/> changes in the international environment.<lb/> Figures A29-31 present the logarithmic difference between the wages reported for<lb/> selected occupations identified as the lowest and highest paying in each country using the<lb/> United States as reference. In this context, zero implies equality of wages and negative<lb/> numbers represent wages lower than the United States, and vice versa for positive<lb/> numbers. No consistent evidence of factor price equalization is shown in the figures. 34<lb/> We do observe, however, the emergence of three wage levels, which seem to be<lb/> associated with the particular country&apos;s development level. For example, in the case of<lb/></p>

			<figure>Field crop farm worker the differences in wages between India and Bangladesh with the<lb/> United States are the largest and maintain a consistent spread. Similarly, for Field worker<lb/> the differences between Mexico and the United States; are smaller compared to India,<lb/> Bangladesh, and China, but still maintain a consistent spread. Finally, the differences in<lb/> wages between Austria, Italy, and Sweden and the United States with respect to Field<lb/> workers are positive –wages are higher in these countries than in the United States—and<lb/> consistent in this pattern. The same pattern can be found for Room attendant or<lb/> Chambermaids. Another example, the case of General physician, shows a repetition of the<lb/> aforementioned pattern. Countries such as Austria, Italy, and Korea have smaller<lb/> 34.<lb/> We examined the evolution of both nominal and real wages. The results are similar.<lb/> differences with the United States and consistently higher wage levels compared to<lb/> China, Hungary, and Mexico.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Finally, regression results looking for convergence effects show no conclusive<lb/> statistical evidence of convergence in real wages. 35 We analyse different sets of cross-<lb/>sectional regressions starting with a simple specification where the dependent variable is<lb/> the percentage change in the real wage as a function of the initial level of development,<lb/> proxied by the logarithm of gross domestic product per capita, and a constant. A negative<lb/> and statistically significant coefficient on the logarithm of gross domestic product per<lb/> capita would suggest a process of wage convergence. More developed countries initially<lb/> would have their wages grow at a slower rate than less developed countries, thus allowing<lb/> for catch-up. <ref type="table">Table A4</ref> in the Annex presents mixed evidence since the parameter<lb/> estimates change sign (regressions 1 and 4) and statistical significance (regressions 2 and<lb/> 5) depending on the estimation method, the time period, and the inclusion of fixed effects.<lb/> Next we include a measure of the country&apos;s initial level of openness, proxied by the<lb/> sum of total imports and total exports as a share of gross domestic product, into the<lb/> regression specification. The objective is to determine if the country&apos;s initial exposure to<lb/> the international economy has any influence on the percentage change in real wages. A<lb/> positive sign associated with the parameter estimate would indicate greater exposure to<lb/> the international economy would be correlated with a greater percentage change in real<lb/> wages. <ref type="table">Table A5</ref> in the Annex presents the regression results. The inclusion of the<lb/> openness measure does not modify the previous conclusion where there is no clear<lb/> evidence suggesting convergence in real wages between developed and developing<lb/> economies. In addition, the openness measure itself does not prove to be robust and<lb/> statistically significant as it is only positive and statistically significant in regressions 7<lb/> and 9.<lb/> Finally, we construct a concordance between the GTAP sectors and the ILO<lb/> occupations and associate the industries in the ILO October Inquiry to the GTAP<lb/> industries. We explore industry heterogeneity in case those industries which are more<lb/> exposed to international trade show evidence of greater wage volatility. Given we were<lb/> only able to map 27 GTAP sectors, we re-ran the regression models including these<lb/> sectors as fixed effects. <ref type="table">Table A6</ref> in the Annex presents the parameter estimates. The<lb/> parameter estimate of the logarithm of real per capita GDP shows mixed results by<lb/> changing direction (regressions 1 and 2 compared to 3, 4, 5, and 6) from positive to<lb/> negative and the parameter estimate associated with openness is not consistently<lb/> statistically significant. All this evidence taken together suggests internal factors have<lb/> greater influence on the setting and evolution of real wages.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus far we have found no significant link between trade and wage determination.<lb/> However, we have shown that, overall, factor abundance is reflected in a country&apos;s trade<lb/> pattern. Therefore the next logical question is then to what extent does factor abundance<lb/> influence factor returns. That is, do the returns paid to abundant factors used intensively<lb/> rise as countries expand trade and fall in those factors that are relatively scarce? In<lb/> particular, this would imply rising wages for low skilled workers in developing countries<lb/> and decreasing wages for this type of individuals in developed economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>To examine this question, we construct yearly wage distributions to obtain more<lb/> detail about the evolution of wages in the OECD and SEM economies. <ref type="figure">Figures</ref> A32<lb/> 35.<lb/> Regression results are reported in Tables 4, 5, and 6 of the Annex.<lb/> 26 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011<lb/> through 39 present these wage distributions for 1984, 1991, 1997, and 2001. 36 <ref type="figure">Figure A32<lb/></ref> presents the estimated wage distribution for OECD countries in 1984 comparing it to a<lb/> normal distribution created using the data&apos;s observed mean and standard deviation. The<lb/> distribution is right-skewed with the majority of the mass concentrating at lower wage<lb/> levels. Similarly, <ref type="figure">Figure A33</ref> presents the wage distribution for SEM economies for 1984.<lb/> While the distribution is skewed to the right, it presents different features such as two<lb/> humps suggesting two major wage levels where most observations concentrate. Like the<lb/> figure for OECD countries these suggest low paying jobs are more abundant and a<lb/> smaller group of individuals command high wages. The remaining figures, <ref type="figure">Figure A34<lb/></ref> through <ref type="figure">Figure A39</ref>, are also right-skewed confirming that high paying jobs are relatively<lb/> scarce.<lb/> Figures A32 through 39 do not consistently suggest the presence of a sorting effect<lb/> related to a skill premium. The skill premium relates to workers possessing a wider set of<lb/> abilities becoming more valuable to firms. Likewise, more productive firms, paying<lb/> higher wages, become more selective in their hiring policies (<ref type="biblio">Helpman, Itskhoki, and<lb/> Redding, 2009</ref>). Therefore, if a larger number of skilled individuals command higher<lb/> wages and firms&apos; hiring policies focus on skills we expect the wage distribution to<lb/> develop multiple humps. The wages of low skilled workers would be located at the lower<lb/> end of the distribution and wages for high skilled individuals would be located around the<lb/> second hump towards the right end of the distribution. We only observe wage<lb/> distributions with two humps for OECD countries in 1997 and for SEM economies in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">1984 and 1997.<lb/></ref> Have the changes in wage distribution observed above been a significant development<lb/> across the OECD and SEMs? Documenting the per cent wage differential across<lb/> occupations over time in each country allows us to look at within country wage<lb/> distribution. Such distributions can be considered an outcome of particular labour<lb/> policies, and can influence the factor content of trade. As these labour market policies,<lb/> such as education and skill enhancement programs, influence a country&apos;s endowment<lb/> structure, it is important to understand the link between policies which influence<lb/> endowments, thus trade, and the potential feedback mechanisms which could impact<lb/> wages.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure A40 presents the evolution of the per cent wage differentials across<lb/> occupations for the countries of interest. 37 Romania presents the biggest percentage<lb/> spread and the largest changes in the spread, implying growing wage inequality. Other<lb/> countries which showed increases in wage inequality from 1990 to the year 2000 are<lb/> Brazil, India, Mexico, Slovakia, Italy, Portugal, and the United States. On the other hand,<lb/> Canada and China show a decrease in wage inequality in this same period. 38 Finally, the<lb/> wage distribution behaves in a stable manner in Finland, Iceland, Belgium, Norway,<lb/> Denmark, The Netherlands, and New Zealand. Norway has the lowest percentage wage<lb/> differential with this being just over one-half. The increase in the observed wage<lb/></figure>

			<table>36.<lb/> The starting point is 1984 since there is no available data for SEMs in 1983.<lb/> 37.<lb/> There are several countries which are not included because of lack of data. In particular Chile,<lb/> France, Luxembourg, Switzerland for the OECD group; Indonesia for the Enhanced Engagement<lb/> group, Egypt, and Malaysia for the other Selected Emerging Market economies.<lb/> 38.<lb/> Given the available data for China only goes to the year 2000 we cannot follow-up on developments<lb/> regarding wage inequality in the subsequent years. However, Wu and Perloff, (2005) report figures<lb/> that suggest an increase in rural-urban inequality in later years.<lb/> THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?– 27<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011<lb/> differential in most economies over this period correlates with world economic expansion<lb/> and increased trade in the decade of the 1990s. This of course does not imply a causal<lb/> link.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure A41</ref> shows a detailed picture of the percent wage evolution among OECD<lb/> countries where data is available. Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Turkey experienced an<lb/> increase in wage inequality, but not the Czech Republic. While Mexico and the United<lb/> States both saw wage inequality increase, the increase in Mexico was greater. Other<lb/> OECD countries that have suffered from an increase in wage inequality are Italy,<lb/> Portugal, and Sweden. On the other hand, Germany, Japan, Austria, Canada, and Korea<lb/> have managed to make their wage distributions more compact. Thus, on the face of<lb/> things, increases in wage inequality are not necessarily associated with large trading<lb/> nations (i.e. difference outcomes for the United States and Germany) nor with those<lb/> having a particular endowment structure (i.e. similar findings for Japan and Canada, for<lb/> example).<lb/> Turning to the SEMs, Romania and Brazil have experienced significant increases in<lb/> wage inequality, while wage inequality in India, Singapore, and China had been falling<lb/> up to the year 2000 (<ref type="figure">Figure A42</ref>).</p>

			<figure>Focusing on Enhanced Engagement and Accession<lb/> economies, Brazil had the highest level of wage inequality followed by India, and Russia.<lb/> Brazil&apos;s percent differential between the lowest and the highest wage was almost<lb/> 28 times.<lb/> No clear linkage between factor content of labour (either in ranking or intensity) and<lb/> wage inequality emerges from this analysis. Thus, while trade expansion has occurred<lb/> during this period of overall wage inequality growth, circumstantial evidence does not<lb/> indicate a strong link to trade. 39<lb/></figure>

			<p>Overall, while we do not explicitly test for FPE, we did not observe trends which<lb/> would suggest factor price equalisation in workers&apos; wages. The differential in wages is<lb/> consistently maintained leading to the improbability of factor return convergence. Stated<lb/> in other terms, wages in developed countries do not seem to be converging towards wage<lb/> levels observed in developing countries with large labour endowments. This was not<lb/> unexpected due to reasons described above, not the least of which is the differences in<lb/> labour productivity noted in Section III. What these various trends do suggest is that<lb/> differences in labour (reflected in different wage levels) lead to the application of<lb/> different technology matrices (which we have shown to play a major role in correctly<lb/> analysing the factor content of trade). We also do not observe reductions in wage<lb/> inequality in unskilled labour abundant countries (SEMs) where this factor of production<lb/> is shown to be used intensively. We observe evidence of a skill premium in the wage<lb/> distributions for 1997 in both OECD and SEMs, but such phenomenon does not appear<lb/> consistently in the figures. However, as Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2009) state,<lb/> firms appear to have changed their hiring practices focusing on hiring workers with a<lb/> wider set of skills. This opens the door to explore and examine the impact of economic<lb/> policies on the domestic labour market of these countries and the effective development<lb/> of a labour endowment</p>

			<table>.<lb/> 39.<lb/> It is possible to try and establish a more robust link between wage inequality and factor content<lb/> through more sophisticated econometrics, but that is beyond the scope of this paper and left to future<lb/> research<lb/> 28 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011<lb/></table>

			<head>VI. Conclusions and areas of policy consideration<lb/></head>

			<p>We observe that overall, factor content is reflected in changing trade patterns while<lb/> the link to relative wages appears to be limited.<lb/> OECD economies as a whole continue to hold the lion&apos;s share of capital and skilled<lb/> labour endowment stocks while SEMs hold more unskilled labour. Overall, measures of<lb/> factor content of trade reflect these holdings. However, while OECD countries have been<lb/> shown to be accumulating capital stocks at a rapid rate, over 4% per annum for the past<lb/> 15 years, SEMs have been doing so at an even faster rate, over 11% over the same time<lb/> period. The same observation can be made for skilled labour; OECD stocks growing at<lb/> over 3% while SEMs are growing at an annual rate of almost 5%.<lb/> Capital/labour (k/l) ratios show that OECD economies remain relatively capital<lb/> intensive, and this is confirmed in the relative rankings of the intensity of this resource<lb/> use in traded goods. Capital consistently ranks high, as does skilled labour. For SEMs, we<lb/> see smaller k/l ratios and these factors rank lower in their relative usage; unskilled labour<lb/> ranks high, but natural resources and land figure prominently in the relative intensity of<lb/> factor usage for SEMs as well. There are broad exceptions (such as Australia for natural<lb/> resources and Brazil for capital) but overall these results hold.<lb/> If, however, we look a little deeper at movements in the rankings and relate them to<lb/> the observed difference in factor accumulation across the country sample, we see<lb/> increasing use of unskilled labour in OECD countries and capital increasing its intensity<lb/> among SEMs.<lb/></p>

			<figure>These changing dynamics are reflected in the total factor content for trade for capital,<lb/> skilled labour and unskilled labour. However, the analysis did yield some unexpected<lb/> results. Among the OECD economies, the two largest capital stock holders – Japan and<lb/> the United States – show deficits in the trade of capital embodied goods. More in line<lb/> with expectations, newly emerging OECD economies such as Hungary, Chile and Poland,<lb/> all show strong surpluses. We see an increase in the use of unskilled labour embodied in<lb/> the United States and Japanese trade, but also in Korea and Australia. SEMs show a<lb/> strong surplus in unskilled labour trade across the board. Finally, skilled labour stocks are<lb/> strongest in the United States and Japan and both show a sizable surplus in the factor<lb/> content of skill embodied trade while only Malaysia and Brazil among the SEMs show a<lb/> surplus here.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The picture emerging among the OECD economies is thus more varied and nuanced<lb/> than that among the SEMs. Part of the explanation for the OECD results could be the<lb/> manner in which we think and account for factors. That is, whether the traditional method<lb/> of measuring actual units of capital and labour, located with the geographic boundaries of<lb/> a country, is still appropriate. Rather, we should be looking at more refined measures of<lb/> individual tasks and factors roles in intermediate inputs, which are not necessarily defined<lb/> by geographic boundaries. The large literature on production fragmentation and<lb/> offshoring attest to this trend. Trade, even factor content, can no longer be thought of as a<lb/> function of the endowments located solely within a country&apos;s borders, but rather can be<lb/> seen as a function of trade-in-goods and trade-in-tasks where the level and direction of<lb/> this trade are a function of the changes in the costs of moving goods and particular tasks<lb/> and ideas, rather than ―jobs.‖<lb/> Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2010) present a model which attempts to integrate these<lb/> new patterns of firm behaviour into traditional trade theory like HOV. They argue that<lb/> this movement of tasks creates ‗shadow migration&apos; and changes the way factors are<lb/> characterised in standard trade theory. This, they argue, explains why standard trade<lb/> theory presents so many ‗unexpected&apos; results.<lb/></p>

			<p>This observation can be inferred from the analysis of trends in factor content with and<lb/> without fully accounting for imported intermediate trade flows. We observe shifting<lb/> patterns in comparative advantage depending on whether we account for worldwide use<lb/> of resources, regardless of location. In the United States we see changes mainly across the<lb/> services sector, while China experiences large differentials in the outcome of their<lb/> manufacturing sector – both of these dynamic and growing sectors in the respective<lb/> economies.<lb/> Finally, when exploring the impact of these trends on wages, and wage differentials,<lb/> we find little evidence of a strong link. This is especially true when we look at trends in<lb/> wage inequality where it appears that domestic conditions have a greater bearing on<lb/> outcomes than trade patterns in general, and factor endowments in particular. For policy<lb/> makers, the complexity of the endowment/trade/wages link means careful analysis is<lb/> required of any policies attempting to affect labour market outcomes through trade.<lb/> As the driving forces behind trade patterns change, so must the approach to<lb/> measuring these patterns. We have shown that intermediate goods play an important role<lb/> in the analysis driving policy advice. In addition, inferred here is the importance of<lb/> foreign direct investment and the role domestic capital, employed overseas, can make to<lb/> notions of trade deficits or surpluses. Thus, policy advice based on simplistic measures of<lb/> trade can be misleading.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given that resource stocks are still a major driver of trade patterns, policies that<lb/> develop and enhance these stocks will help countries shape their future comparative<lb/> advantage.<lb/> We have shown that factor content is an important determinant of comparative<lb/> advantage and that comparative advantage, in turn, drives trade patterns. What is<lb/> important for policymakers is the fact that this directional flow -endowments to<lb/> comparative advantage to trade – does not work in the reverse order. Targeting industries<lb/> and ―picking winners‖ is inefficient in the long run, because it is inconsistent with this<lb/> basic causal flow. Therefore, trying to impact endowment sectors – such as employment –<lb/> through trade policy is counter-productive. That is not to say that a country cannot have<lb/> an influence on its comparative advantage, rather this is best accomplished by developing<lb/> factors more broadly. A major policy implication of this work is that the best approach to<lb/> influencing trade outcomes is to invest in resource market enhancement, such as<lb/> education and training for labour and transparency and availability for capital.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data Annex<lb/></head>

			<p>Capital and LabourStocks for both capital and labour are expressed in units. The<lb/> capital stocks were calculated with the perpetual inventory method using real gross fixed<lb/> capital formation flows from the World Bank World Development Indicators. For the<lb/> base stock in 1980, an average of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) flows was<lb/> calculated from 1978 to 1982 to limit year specific anomalies and multiplied it by two.<lb/> The depreciation rate used was 7%. The stocks were adjusted with the price of investment<lb/> from the Penn World Tables to convert the PPP values into units of capital. Data for<lb/> stocks were unavailable for Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey, Slovenia, Singapore, and<lb/> Israel.<lb/> Labour stocks were taken from the IIASA and Vienna Institute for Demography data<lb/> sets. Labour stocks are defined as total population over the age of fifteen, providing<lb/> information about the total human capital available, but not differentiating between<lb/> economically active and those that are unable or choose not to work. These data report<lb/> populations by age, sex and level of educational attainment for 120 countries for 1970-<lb/>2000 using demographic back projection methods. Skilled labour includes the population<lb/> with completed tertiary education. This data set takes into account fertility, mortality, and<lb/> migration rates for improving the accuracy of population projections by education level.<lb/> The<lb/> data<lb/> and<lb/> methodology<lb/> paper<lb/> can<lb/> be<lb/> accessed<lb/> at:<lb/> www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/POP/edu07/index.html?sb=12.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given actual observation for 2005 are unavailable, the data for 2005 was taken from<lb/> the Education Forward Projections dataset for 2000-2050. The data was based on the<lb/> Global Education Trend Scenario series which assumes that a country&apos;s educational<lb/> expansion will converge on an expansion trajectory based on the historical global trend.<lb/> Identification of the global trend is based on a data driven-judgmental analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>To minimise inconsistencies and promote analysis based on real trends as opposed to<lb/> difference in accounting methods, we focused on obtaining data from sources which<lb/> covered as many countries as possible, over as long a time period as possible. We<lb/> examined flows of capital and labour relative to their contribution to output. All measures<lb/> for flows are in US dollars (USD). For annual expenditures on capital and labour, we<lb/> used GFCF and Total Wage Bill to Value Added. The majority of the data for OECD<lb/> countries was taken from the OECD Structural Analysis database (STAN) whenever<lb/> available. Gaps in this data and information for non-OECD countries were supplemented<lb/> from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics database and the World Bank Trade Production and<lb/> Protection database. Remaining gaps in the data were supplemented from national<lb/> sources. For Brazilian GFCF, we utilised information from the Annual Industrial Survey<lb/> (Pesquisa Industrial annual) from the IBGE website (www.ibge.gov.br). Firm level data<lb/> for manufacturing companies was used summing new capital formation with<lb/> improvement to existing capital less depreciation. These capital figures were then<lb/> converted to USD using OECD MEI exchange rate figures for this period. For South<lb/> Africa, GFCF figures were taken from the South African Reserve Bank reporting GFCF<lb/> by Economic Activity and these figures were also converted using MEI exchange rates.<lb/> GFCF, Value Added, and employment for China were gathered from the National Bureau<lb/> of Statistics of China from the Statistical Yearbooks. The Employment data was collected<lb/> from the employment breakdown by sector for manufacturing, the GFCF was taken from<lb/> the GDP by expenditure series, and Value Added were supplied by the OECD&apos;s<lb/> Economics Department from staff calculations based on other national sources. Indian<lb/> employment data were taken from the IPUMS micro data set put together by the<lb/> University of Michigan. This survey data provided employment information by sector <ref type="biblio">for<lb/> 1983, 1987, 1993, 1999, and 2004</ref>. Despite these efforts, some gaps in the data persist.<lb/> Data for GFCF was unavailable for Switzerland, Russia and Slovenia. For Total Wage<lb/> Bill data is missing for Switzerland.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For the labour productivity calculations of output per worker, we used World Bank<lb/> World Development Indicators of total labour force and GDP in constant USD 2000.<lb/> Ideally, a measure of GDP per hour worked would have been useful, but no complete<lb/> cross country data on this was available at this time.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Trends in factor content<lb/></head>

			<p>This section relies primarily on data from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP).<lb/> This publicly available, completely documented (<ref type="biblio">Dimaranan and McDougall (2002)</ref> and<lb/> Badri and <ref type="biblio">Walmsley (2008)</ref>) database provides input-output tables for between 45 and<lb/> 85 countries (depending on the database version), 57 sectors and five factors of<lb/> production. It consists of independently complied country-specific input-output tables<lb/> (thus allowing us to recover country-specific technology matrices) which are reconciled<lb/> to bilateral trade data and other statistics. The data have been through seven public<lb/> releases and have been extensively tested by members of the GTAP consortium and other<lb/> researchers.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to observe the factor content in different time periods, we use three of the<lb/> GTAP databases to derive the necessary components of this part of our analysis. These<lb/> databases are version 5, corresponding to a base year of 1997; version 6 corresponding to<lb/> a base year of 2001 and version 7, corresponding to a base year of 2004. To cover as<lb/> many countries and sectors in a consistent manner, GTAP measurements are made in<lb/> value terms (US$). This allows the consistent basis from which to compare outcomes<lb/> across countries. While we do acknowledge the well known shortcomings of measuring<lb/> economic variables in USD (as well as the shortcomings of other measures such a PPP),<lb/> we believe the value in obtaining an internally consistent database outweighs any<lb/> potential bias introduced in our figures.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents the primary regions covered in our analysis and the corresponding<lb/> year of the base input-output data for each database version.</p>

			<head>Trends in relative wages<lb/></head>

			<p>The Occupational Wages around the World dataset by Richard Freeman and Remco<lb/> Oostendorp was used to examine wages and occupations. Freeman and Oostendorp<lb/> transformed the International Labour Organization&apos;s October Inquiry Survey into a<lb/> consistent data file on pay for 161 occupations in over 150 countries from 1983 to 2003.<lb/> The standardization allowed for comparison across countries circumventing measurement<lb/> problems such as differences in reporting units, quality of reporting sources, wage levels,<lb/> and any other country specific issues. The wages are reported in domestic currency units<lb/> and in US dollars. The figures employed were in US dollars and deflated using the<lb/> deflators in the Penn World Tables to account for purchasing power parity issues. The<lb/> following tables present the countries, industries, and occupations used in the wage<lb/> analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Technical Annex<lb/> The theory<lb/></head>

			<p>The theory of trade and comparative advantage has a long tradition in the economics<lb/> profession. Starting with Ricardo (whose theory predicts that a country will export<lb/> products in which it has a comparative advantage, that is, where its labour productivity is<lb/> high relative to its labour productivity in other products. The theory moved on to<lb/> Heckscher (1919) and Ohlin (1933) who emphasized the role of labour, capital and land<lb/> in explaining how their availability shapes a country&apos;s pattern of specialisation and hence<lb/> their comparative advantage. Samuelson (1948) (and others) developed the two-factor,<lb/> two-sector model that became the standard for trade theory leading to the version of the<lb/> H-O model where a capital rich country – that is, one that has more capital per worker<lb/> than its trade partners – should export capital-intensive products.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Leontief (1953)</ref> calculated the labour-output and capital-output ratios for various<lb/> sectors in the United States economy and then calculated how much of these factors were<lb/> embodied in US exports and imports. He found that the capital-labour ratio of US imports<lb/> exceeded the ratio embodied in exports by 60%. This finding became known as the<lb/> ―Leontief paradox‖. While the next several decades were devoted to solving this paradox,<lb/> a test of the generalised H-O theory was elusive due to the fact that the theory predicts the<lb/> relationship between endowments and trade within a certain technological structure. Thus<lb/> to test the theory, one needs information on technology, endowments and trade.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Vanek (1968)</ref> shows that under the HO model&apos;s assumptions, using a common<lb/> technology matrix, the Leontief measure of factor content should equal the economy&apos;s<lb/> measure of factor abundance. That is, the total factor content of a country&apos;s production<lb/> (equal to that country&apos;s endowments) minus the factor content of its consumption should<lb/> provide a measure of factor abundance where those factors that are relatively abundant<lb/> are exported and those that are scarce are imported. This became known as the HOV<lb/> model.<lb/></p>

			<p>Work that followed focused on identifying the gap between measured factor content<lb/> of trade and the HO theoretically predicted value. <ref type="biblio">Trefler (1995)</ref> was one of the first to<lb/> show clearly the ways in which the data used to measure the theory deviates from the<lb/> predictions of the model.</p>

			<figure>Most of the subsequent work focused on the deviation of the<lb/> common technology matrix and the inclusion of trade in intermediate inputs. This body of<lb/> work (see, for example Davis and Weinstein (2001), Hakura (2001), Trefler and Zhu<lb/> (2000, 2010) and Reimer (2006)) has shown the importance of incorporating these<lb/> aspects when examining factor content of trade.<lb/> 44 – THE ROLE OF FACTOR CONTENT IN TRADE: HAVE CHANGES IN FACTOR ENDOWMENTS BEEN REFLECTED IN TRADE PATTERNS AND ON RELATIVE WAGES?<lb/> OECD TRADE POLICY WORKING PAPER NO. 109 © OECD 2011<lb/></figure>

			<head>The model<lb/></head>

			<p>We start with the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model which is set in a multi-good,<lb/> multi-factor world and focuses on the factor service content, such as labour, capital and<lb/> land that are embodied in the exports and imports of countries. <ref type="biblio">Vanek (1968)</ref> showed that<lb/> a country&apos;s net factor content of trade equals its own factor endowments minus its share<lb/> of the world factor endowments, share being based on the country&apos;s share of world<lb/> expenditures. So for country i,</p>

				<formula>F i = V i – s i V W , where F i</formula>

			<p>is the factor content of its net<lb/> trade, V i ,V W , its and the world&apos;s factor endowments respectively and s i its share of world<lb/> expenditures. Measuring factor content of trade using expenditure shares, however, does<lb/> not capture the true factor services utilised by a particular country (<ref type="biblio">Deardorff, 1982</ref>).<lb/> Thus, a better measure of factor content is using consumption shares.<lb/> Thus, the HOV model of international trade can be stated as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>w<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> V<lb/> s<lb/> V<lb/> AT<lb/> F<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>First, studies examining the factor content generally look at a subset of countries and<lb/> thus apply a common reference base (either technology matrix or productivity<lb/> adjustment). For example, Reimer examines the factor content of trade in the context of<lb/> two entities: the United States, and an agglomeration of technology matrices for the rest<lb/> of the world (ROW). He then adjusts this ROW matrix for productivity differences with<lb/> respect to the base country, the Unites States. In this study, we apply country-specific<lb/> technology matrices for each of the economies examined and thus the differences in the<lb/> technologies applied in each region are captured in their own technology matrices.<lb/> On a more practical basis, the primary reason for the implementation of this<lb/> adjustment in the literature is to improve the performance of their measured factor content<lb/> when tested against the theoretically predicted value. It is not the purpose of this work to<lb/> test the validity of the HOV model. Indeed, as briefly outlined above and in much more<lb/> detail in the various works cited, this service has been performed. Rather we are using the<lb/> model to measure factor content and fully expect these values to diverge precisely based<lb/> on their productivity differentials. To do a prior adjustment for these differences is to<lb/> reduce the information available in the measured values themselves.<lb/></p>

			<head>Factor price equalisation<lb/></head>

			<p>The failure of factor price equalisation (FPE) can lead to important differences in the<lb/> technology matrices for traded and nontraded goods. The input coefficients differ in<lb/> tradables because the failure of FPE has led countries to specialise in different goods.<lb/> They differ in nontradables because the same goods are produced with different factor<lb/> proportions. To the extent that FPE breaks down, the standard HOV needs to be adjusted<lb/> to account for departures in the factor usage of nontrables goods from world averages.<lb/></p>

			<p>The need to make this adjustment is tied to the standardisation of technology matrices<lb/> across countries. Again, we are not applying world averages when inputting our<lb/> technology matrices so the adjustment is not as critical for our database. However, this<lb/> issue does come into play when determining which data measurement (i.e. values versus<lb/> units) arises. If the only reason that factor prices differ is due to factor-augmenting<lb/> productivity differences, then we can use the reported values as representative of<lb/> efficiency-adjusted factor usage as this measure is well suited for calculations of the input<lb/> matrices. However, it is well acknowledged that FPE breaks down for reasons beyond<lb/> quality differences. To the extent this breakdown is not captured, it is preferable to<lb/> measure factor usage in terms of physical units and adjust for international quality<lb/> differences in a different manner.<lb/> Converting to physical units poses several problems for the analysis presented here.<lb/> First, it dramatically reduces the number of factors available for examination to those<lb/> with relevant, observable price information, i.e. total labour and capital. It also removes a<lb/> source of information on factor-augmenting productivity differences which, as explained<lb/> above, we purposefully make no adjustment for. Finally, as stated above, studies of factor<lb/> content are designed to test the differential between fit of the theorectically-constrained<lb/> model (for example, under assumptions of the realisation of factor price equalisation) and<lb/> measured values. We, on the other hand, are interested in what measured values say about<lb/> revealed patterns of trade between countries. The theory often factors away the exact<lb/> differences we hope to observe. Thus, we maintain measurement using values as opposed<lb/> to units. 40<lb/></p>

			<head>Intermediates<lb/></head>

			<p>While previous studies have incorporated intermediates into their analysis, they are<lb/> generally treated as non-traded (for example Davis and Weinstein (2001) and <ref type="biblio">Hakura<lb/> (2001)</ref>). Reimer developed an approach allowing for internationally traded intermediate<lb/> inputs in to the calculation of factor content. Theoretical proofs for such an approach<lb/> were further provided in <ref type="biblio">Trefler and Zhu (2010)</ref>, that demonstrated the class of models<lb/> that completely characterises, and are implied by, the Vanek prediction of the factor<lb/> content of trade, including a traded intermediate sector. This section relies upon these<lb/> theoretical developments to construct measures of factor content that accounts for both<lb/> technological differences across country&apos;s production processes while explicitly including<lb/> trade in intermediate goods that does not impose the importing country&apos;s technology, but<lb/> rather allows for the producing a country&apos;s choice in techniques.<lb/></p>

			<p>Consider an economy with k factors and i goods so that the Leontief matrix is:<lb/></p>

				<formula>D(I -B) -1<lb/> (A2)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where each column of the k x i matrix D consists of primary factor inputs and each<lb/> column of the i x i matrix (I -B) -1 captures the total intermediate inputs in the production<lb/> of a good or service. 41 Proper measurement of B ensures that the matrix of direct and<lb/> indirect factor requirements includes all the services of k endowments. In addition, by<lb/> defining each D and B matrix through each country&apos;s unique input-output structure, we<lb/> capture the technological differences in production needed to completely define the factor<lb/> content approach.<lb/> Referring back to the original HOV equation (1), we can restate it as follows:<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> k<lb/> i<lb/> k<lb/> AT<lb/> F <lb/> A now defined as<lb/> 1<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> )<lb/> B<lb/> (I<lb/> D<lb/> A<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (A3)<lb/> thus:<lb/> i<lb/> k<lb/> 1<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> k<lb/> i<lb/> k<lb/> T<lb/> )<lb/> B<lb/> (I<lb/> D<lb/> F<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (A4)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Trefler and Zhu (2010) argue while several studies have applied equation (A4) to<lb/> measure factor content, they have not done so consistently, nor fully accounting for<lb/> international technological diversification. They show that the definition of factor content<lb/> of trade needs to satisfy three criteria: 1) must be Vanek-relevant, that is consistent with<lb/> the Vanek prediction that factor content is defined as in (A1); 2) the definition has a clear<lb/> 40.<lb/> As a means of comparison we adjusted for prices in the capital resource using data from two<lb/> different sources: the Penn World Tables (as in <ref type="biblio">Trefler and Zhu (2006)</ref>) and prices derived directly<lb/> from the GTAP database (as in <ref type="biblio">Reimer (2006)</ref>) and found no substantial qualitative differences in<lb/> the results at the sector level.<lb/> 41.<lb/> See <ref type="biblio">Trefler and Zhu (2010)</ref> for the technical proof.<lb/> and useful economic interpretation; and 3) the definition does not require restrictions on<lb/> the form of international choice of technology. However, arriving at such a definition of<lb/> factor content when international technology matrices are allowed to vary has proven<lb/> difficult.<lb/></p>

			<p>As stated above, Reimer (2006) does allow for internationally determined and traded<lb/> intermediate inputs in his model. He uses a horizontal concatenation of country-specific<lb/> direct factor input matrices to construct B in equation (A4) and thus provide an indication<lb/> of how much of the world&apos;s factor k is embodied in i&apos;s production of a good. However,<lb/> Reimer&apos;s model consists of two countries: the United States and the ROW and two factor<lb/> inputs, labour and capital. Thus, it does not completely specify a variety of international<lb/> technological choices. As we are attempting to measure the factor content (and thus input<lb/> matrices) for 44 regions and five factors of production, applying such an approach<lb/> becomes unwieldy, not to mention involving the loss of a tremendous amount of detail.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Trefler and Zhu (2010)</ref> developed a more generalised approach relying on the<lb/> proportionality assumption to recover a B matrix that is consistent with their three<lb/> criteria. They derive an adjustment parameter,  to recover the share of domestic<lb/> consumption, including intermediates, sourced locally. 42 Thus, we are able to estimate<lb/> the world trade in intermediate inputs – that is, those sourced (and produced) locally and<lb/> those sourced (and produced) overseas – by defining B as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> *<lb/> B<lb/> B<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (A5)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where i<lb/> j<lb/> B is the input matrix of i sourced from j and  is defined as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> j<lb/> all<lb/> for<lb/> (g)<lb/> X<lb/> -<lb/>(g)<lb/> M<lb/> (g)<lb/> Q<lb/> )<lb/> (<lb/> )<lb/> (<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> g<lb/> M<lb/> g<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> <lb/> (A6)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where Q is output of good g in i, M is imports of good g (in the numerator into i from j,<lb/> and the denominator is i&apos;s total imports of g) and X is the exports of g from i.</p>

				<formula>Thus i<lb/> j<lb/>  (g)<lb/></formula>

			<p>is the share of domestic absorption that is sourced from country j. Summing over all j<lb/> sources and subtracting from 1 provides the share of good g that is sourced locally.<lb/> Referring explicitly to an intermediate input matrix of dimensions g, h (input of good g<lb/> into industry h), we define</p>

				<formula>i<lb/> j<lb/> B (g,h) as elements of i<lb/> j<lb/> B and i<lb/> B ˆ (g,h) as elements of<lb/> i<lb/> B ˆ   j<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/></formula>

			<p>B . We then have:<lb/></p>

				<formula>)<lb/> (<lb/> )<lb/> ,<lb/> (<lb/> ˆ<lb/> )<lb/> ,<lb/> (<lb/> g<lb/> h<lb/> g<lb/> B<lb/> h<lb/> g<lb/> B<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , (imported intermediates)<lb/> )<lb/> (<lb/> )<lb/> ,<lb/> (<lb/> ˆ<lb/> )<lb/> ,<lb/> (<lb/> g<lb/> h<lb/> g<lb/> B<lb/> h<lb/> g<lb/> B<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , (local intermediates)<lb/> (A7)<lb/></formula>

			<p>And further, a simple extension leads us to:<lb/></p>

				<formula>)<lb/> (<lb/> )<lb/> ,<lb/> (<lb/> ˆ<lb/> )<lb/> ,<lb/> (<lb/> g<lb/> h<lb/> g<lb/> B<lb/> h<lb/> g<lb/> B<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> for all i and j<lb/> (A8)<lb/> 42.<lb/></formula>

			<p>As expressed in equation (A5), where equation (A5) suppresses the (g,h) reference to<lb/> industries. When <ref type="biblio">Trefler and Zhu (2010)</ref> applied this adjustment to data for 41 countries,<lb/> focusing on labour inputs, their results show a 95% consistency rate with predicted<lb/> values, as opposed to the 34% reported in previous studies.<lb/> By measuring the amount of factors used worldwide to produce a country&apos;s trade<lb/> flows, we can say that the factor requirements matrix for country i&apos;s trade is constructed<lb/> accounting for the complete production process of each good that enters into net exports<lb/> and adding up the factors actually used, including those used in producing intermediate<lb/> inputs overseas (<ref type="biblio">Deardorff 1982</ref>). This will further allow us to analyse the role of<lb/> intermediate inputs in trade, by comparing the F derived in equations (A1) with its<lb/> counterpart expressed generally in equation (A4), and adjusted by (A5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Ranking factor content<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to better understand the potential drivers of the factor content of trade, it is<lb/> important to understand the relative factor endowment structure both within, and<lb/> between, countries, and how that has changed over time. According to equation (A1), net<lb/> exports of a factor is positive (negative) if the country&apos;s endowment of the factor is great<lb/> (lower) than its content of total domestic consumption, that is if</p>

				<formula>V i<lb/> k – s i V w<lb/> k &gt;0, for factor k.<lb/></formula>

			<p>Additionally, it is possible to look at a country&apos;s relative factor abundance (each<lb/> endowment relative to other endowments within a country) by examining the variables<lb/> normalised by the factor content of the country&apos;s consumption. Again, from<lb/> equation (A1) we can define the following:<lb/></p>

				<formula>s<lb/> V<lb/> c<lb/> w<lb/> k<lb/> k<lb/> *<lb/> <lb/> (A9)<lb/></formula>

			<p>where s remains the country&apos;s share of world consumption, V w<lb/> k is the world endowment of<lb/> factor k and c k is the content of factor k in domestic consumption (<ref type="biblio">Muriel and Terra<lb/> 2009</ref>). The factor abundance test can be compared across the various factors k such that:<lb/></p>

			<head>Data<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to derive the various data points needed to obtain a HOV-consistent measure<lb/> of factor content of trade, we need to have consistent measures of world output,<lb/> consumption, trade, factors of productions and intermediate inputs.
