			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper provides a comprehensive overview of adolescent career plans reported in PISA 2006. Its <lb/>main focus is on the differences in the status and area of employment expected by girls and boys in high <lb/>school. In almost all countries, girls lead boys in their interest in non-manual, high status professional <lb/>occupations. This can be seen as a vertical dimension of gender segregation in occupational preferences. <lb/>Students also differ by gender in selecting particular fields of employment within status categories. These <lb/>differences make up the horizontal segregation of students&apos; expectations and, in PISA 2006, are prominent <lb/>in the gendered choices of specific subfields of science. Both the vertical and the horizontal dimensions <lb/>must be considered to appreciate the cultural and institutional factors which promote and reinforce <lb/>systematic divides in career choices of adolescent boys and girls. <lb/>Although, in many countries, the proportions of girls and boys interested in a science-related career <lb/>are comparable, the types of careers which appeal to each gender are markedly different. Few girls desire <lb/>employment in computing and engineering, while careers in health services do not attract many boys. <lb/>Leaving science-related employment aside, socio-cultural professions appeal to girls much more than boys. <lb/>Remarkably, this pattern holds across all PISA-participating nations, although the size of the gender gap <lb/>varies by country. <lb/>The paper also presents an analysis of potential determinants of this gap, including student academic <lb/>performance, course-taking patterns, socio-economic background, parental occupations, students&apos; <lb/>placement in vocational tracks, career information and career preparation in school. While all of these <lb/>factors make separate contributions to determining the types of careers young people expect, none of them <lb/>can fully explain the horizontal segregation of expectations by gender. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>Introduction: the importance of career plans <lb/>1. <lb/>One way of approaching the study of students&apos; occupational plans is to see them as &quot;supply-side&quot; <lb/>factors which shape the occupational composition of labour force in particular countries (Charles and <lb/>Grusky, 2004). In contrast to &quot;demand-side&quot; determinants, &quot;supply-side&quot; factors comprise individual <lb/>preferences, cultural climates and resources available to young people. Educational experiences can be <lb/>expected to play a significant role in the process of crystallisation of occupational expectations, which, in <lb/>turn, are known to be consequential for attainments. Thus much can be gained from an understanding of <lb/>why and how young people set their minds on particular career paths. <lb/>2. <lb/>The knowledge of student career plans enables tracing the process of preference formation and <lb/>the extent to which plans correspond to cultural trends, respond to market changes and are forged by <lb/>institutional factors. Psychological theories supported by empirical evidence posit that occupational <lb/>expectations of adolescents in senior high school are formed with a relatively realistic assessment of future <lb/>opportunities and difficulties in realising personal goals (Gottfredson 1981; Gottfredson 2002; Helwig <lb/>2008). Sociological research confirms this proposition (Kerckhoff 1976) and, moreover, demonstrates that <lb/>ambitious occupational plans are good predictors of high status attainment in early adulthood (Feliciano <lb/>and Rumbaut 2005; Sikora and Saha, 2011). This is the case even after youth educational plans, <lb/>performance and attainments are all taken into account. <lb/>3. <lb/>More recent studies point to the possibility of a progressive &quot; decoupling &quot; between educational <lb/>and occupational expectations and thus the weakening of the relationship between the former and latter <lb/>(Goyette 2008; Reynolds, Stewart, MacDonald, and Sischo, 2006). One line of argument proposes that, <lb/>despite the widely assumed link between educational achievement and productivity, educational expansion <lb/>leads to the situation where university completion has ceased to &quot;guarantee&quot; future high status employment <lb/>(Goyette, 2008: 465). Moreover, labour markets become more flexible and volatile which makes the life-<lb/>long career trajectories, typical for the baby boomers, no longer available to the younger generations. <lb/>Nowadays, vocational objectives can be partly or entirely dissociated from educational goals if young <lb/>people treat completing particular stages of education as &quot; the next life stage &quot; rather than a path to pursuing <lb/>a particular career. <lb/>4. <lb/>In any case, the information about educational expectations of students available in PISA surveys <lb/>cannot offer insights into both vertical and horizontal segregation of students&apos; educational plans by gender, <lb/>as PISA collects information about the expected level but not field of future education. In contrast, the <lb/>PISA-based information on occupational plans has the potential to reveal both dimensions of gender <lb/>segregation, affording a more complex but also more accurate picture of cultural and institutional forces <lb/>which promote gender divides in students&apos; educational and occupational pathways. <lb/>5. <lb/>From the point of view of educational policymaking the orientation in patterns of students&apos; career <lb/>expectations is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it reveals whether students&apos; expectations are aligned <lb/>with the range of available educational pathways, future employment opportunities and students&apos; own <lb/>educational plans. Next, this knowledge enables an assessment of the degree to which clear plans as <lb/>opposed to &quot;indecision&quot;, that is lack of career plans, impact on individual students&apos; outcomes in education <lb/>and the labour market. Such knowledge reveals the degree to which individual determination may <lb/>compensate for lower levels of cultural, economic and social capital among the disadvantaged but <lb/>academically able students. Finally it exposes the extent to which students themselves view their <lb/>educational experiences as consequential for their future employment. <lb/>6. <lb/>Cross-national comparisons of student career plans are valuable as a means of identifying <lb/>educational and gender ideologies as well as macro-economic and institutional factors which provide a <lb/>context for plans&apos; formation and realisation. In particular, international comparisons of student career plans <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>can reveal how widespread gender differences are at this stage of adolescence. Lastly, students&apos; plans can <lb/>be compared with the actual segregation in employment to highlight the extent to which high school <lb/>student choices translate into gendered patterns in the labour market. <lb/>Data, Measurement and Method <lb/>7. <lb/>This paper is based on the data from PISA 2006 surveys, which contained an extended module <lb/>devoted to science performance, students&apos; attitudes towards science as well as their perceptions of the value <lb/>of science, including its desirability as one&apos;s future career. Of the 57 countries which participated in the <lb/>PISA 2006 surveys, Qatar and Liechtenstein have been excluded from the analyses due to lack of <lb/>information on the key independent variables e.g. gender. The technical details regarding the PISA 2006 <lb/>sampling design, response rates, and questionnaires with exact question wording are available in <lb/>comprehensive technical documentation which can be accessed at www.oecd.org/pisa. Therefore we do not <lb/>describe them here in detail. <lb/>How career plans are measured <lb/>8. <lb/>There is an important conceptual distinction between aspirations and expectations. Aspirations <lb/>refer to life plans which are relatively unaffected by perceived social restraints, while expectations take <lb/>these restraints into account (Saha, 1983; Saha, 1997). While up to the 1980s these concepts were often <lb/>considered equivalent, expectations have been found to be better predictors of actual outcomes than <lb/>aspirations (Goyette 2008). The PISA questionnaires include a single-question measure of students&apos; <lb/>expectations of the following form: <lb/>What kind of job do you expect to have when you are about 30 years old? <lb/>Write the job title:___________________________________ <lb/>9. <lb/>The responses to this open-ended question have been classified according to the ISCO88, <lb/>International Standard Classification of Occupations 88 (International Labour Office. 1988). It is these <lb/>coded responses that have been used to construct scores for students&apos; expectations on the ISEI index of <lb/>occupational status, following the methodology outlined in Ganzeboom, de Graaf and Treiman (1992). <lb/>10. <lb/>While a single question can be seen as suboptimal compared to multiple item measurement, <lb/>particularly in light of concerns expressed about the variability of adolescents&apos; plans over time (Rindfuss, <lb/>Cooksey, and Sutterlin 1999: 231), the single question approach is a standard form of collecting <lb/>occupational data. Moreover, longitudinal research from Australia indicates that while occupations desired <lb/>by teenagers vary over time, their preferences in terms of occupational status are significantly more stable <lb/>(Sikora and Saha, 2011). Teenage preferences seem particularly constant at the aggregate level, that is <lb/>when they are grouped into major groups of an occupational classification like ISCO88 (International <lb/>Labour Office. 1988) or similar. For instance in Australia, approximately 80 % of students aiming to work <lb/>in a professional occupation in Year 10, continue to list one of the professions as their intended labour <lb/>market destination also in Year 12 (Sikora and Saha, 2011). <lb/>11. <lb/>Nevertheless, data on occupational expectations are affected, in some PISA-participating <lb/>countries, by high levels of missing answers (Appendix 4). Because the focus of this paper is on gender <lb/>differences in the expectations of science-related employment, it is possible to assess the differences <lb/>between students who answered and did not answer the question about their expected occupation using a <lb/>closely related multi-item scale on science-related future (SCIEFUT)(OECD, 2007b: 16). This scale is <lb/>useful for this purpose as it incorporates the following statement &quot;I would like to work in a career <lb/>involving science&quot; alongside three similar items. The scale has low levels of missing data (from 0.1% in <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Korea to 10% in Israel) and the analysis of its mean values, presented in Appendix 4, reveals that, in many <lb/>countries, there are few differences in future science career orientation for students who did and did not <lb/>provide their expected occupation. In the eleven countries where such differences exist in girls&apos; plans, and <lb/>in seventeen countries in which boys&apos; plans differ between the two groups, the differences are small <lb/>(Appendix 4 Tables 1a and 1b). They do not exceed 20% of a standard deviation on a measurement scale <lb/>ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 standard deviations. The scale measurement units have been standardised within <lb/>the OECD countries. What further validates the results of this analysis is that they correspond to the <lb/>patterns of gender composition of tertiary courses enrolment (Charles and Bradley, 2009; OECD, 2006: <lb/>37) and employment segregation (Charles and Grusky, 2004). <lb/>Method <lb/>12. <lb/>This paper comprises two major parts with a number of sub-sections which focus on specific <lb/>research questions relevant to students&apos; career expectations and their differentiation by gender. The first <lb/>part is a broad overview of the distributions in students&apos; preferences for high status employment, <lb/>employment in science and in particular sub-fields of science. The second part comprises a series of <lb/>multilevel models conducted separately for each country and, where indicated, on a pooled sample of all <lb/>countries. <lb/>Descriptive analysis <lb/>13. <lb/>Since the PISA surveys are based on a two-stage stratified cluster sample design where schools <lb/>are sampled with unequal probability, all descriptive analyses are weighted with sampling weights to <lb/>obtain the correct point estimates. Moreover, the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) weights with Fay&apos;s <lb/>adjustment have been used to achieve unbiased estimates of the population sampling variances (OECD <lb/>2007b). <lb/>14. <lb/>In analyses where students achievement in science has been represented by plausible values <lb/>(Mislevy et al, 1992), all the estimates were obtained using plausible values methodology. This involved <lb/>first fitting five sets of models, each with one plausible value, and then aggregating these analyses using <lb/>the Rubin rule (Little and Rubin, 1987). <lb/>Multilevel models <lb/>15. <lb/>Most multivariate analyses were conducted with two level random intercept models for binary <lb/>outcomes. Some models involved continuous dependent variables and one estimation involved a three <lb/>level model. The details of the functional form for these additional models are in Appendix 5. The focal <lb/>analyses in this paper are based on two-level multilevel logit models. In such models (Raudenbush and <lb/>Bryk 2002) the probability of success π ij of person i from school j is modeled using the log of the odds of <lb/>success: <lb/>The model has the following functional form : <lb/>Student level (1): <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>logit( ) <lb/>N <lb/>ij <lb/>j <lb/>n n <lb/>n <lb/>X <lb/>π <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>+ ∑ <lb/>School level (2): <lb/>0 <lb/>0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>u <lb/>β <lb/>γ <lb/>= + <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>16. <lb/>Where logit( ) <lb/>ij <lb/>π denotes the log of the odds of a student&apos;s expectation to work in a specific field <lb/>of employment and β 0j is the constant or the intercept in school j and 00 <lb/>γ is the average intercept across <lb/>schools in each country. The error component u 0j is a component varying between schools within each <lb/>country. β 1 through β N are regression coefficients for the corresponding student-level explanatory variables <lb/>X 1 through X N. <lb/>17. <lb/>For all types of outcomes, the robust estimation of standard errors is used as it is less sensitive to <lb/>departures from normality and also the non-independence of observations caused by a two-stage stratified <lb/>cluster sample design. A number of analyses presented in this paper has been replicated on the data in <lb/>which missing values were imputed with the multiple imputation procedures. The results are available in <lb/>the companion excel file for this publication. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES: DISTRIBUTIONS OF STUDENTS&apos; EXPECTATIONS <lb/>18. <lb/>Across OECD and partner countries and economies, a substantial share of students&apos; career goals <lb/>corresponds to the top ISCO and ISEI occupation status scores, as illustrated by Figure 1. Prior studies <lb/>based on PISA (Marks, 2010; McDaniel, 2010; Sikora and Saha, 2007; Sikora and Saha, 2009) and other <lb/>surveys of youth going back at least three decades (Croll, 2008; Goyett,e 2008; Little, 1978; Reynolds et <lb/>al, and Sischo 2006) consistently find that high school students tend to be quite ambitious in setting their <lb/>educational and occupational goals. <lb/>19. <lb/>Moreover, evidence from the United States shows that the levels of student ambition ascend from <lb/>generation to generation (Reynolds et al, 2006). As far as occupational plans are concerned, student <lb/>preferences tend to centre heavily on occupations which require at least some tertiary study. Most <lb/>occupations grouped in ISCO88 (International Labour Office, 1988) under the label of 1) legislators, senior <lb/>officials and managers or 2) professionals require a minimum of university degree at entry, extended levels <lb/>of numeracy and literacy as well as excellent personal intercommunication skills. These skills are denoted <lb/>by level 4 in the nomenclature of ISCO88. The occupations listed as 3) technicians and associate <lb/>professionals require similar skills at a high level and usually necessitate from one to three years of study <lb/>in a tertiary education institution. Few students see their future in any of the occupations listed in the <lb/>remaining major groups, i.e. 4) Clerks, 5) Service workers and shop and market sales workers, 6) Skilled <lb/>agricultural and fishery workers, 7) Craft and related workers, 8) Plant and machine operators and <lb/>assemblers and 9) Elementary occupations. Nevertheless, of those who expect high status careers in high <lb/>school, many find employment in occupations listed in groups 4 through 9 upon the completion of their <lb/>studies (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005; Sikora and Saha, 2011). <lb/>20. <lb/>Following an overview of cross-country patterns in students&apos; expectations in the next section, the <lb/>subsequent sections illustrate the key features in the vertical segregation of adolescent career plans by <lb/>gender. <lb/>Overambitious adolescents? <lb/>21. <lb/>Participants in PISA 2006 expect to pursue highly skilled lines of employment, dominated by the <lb/>professions and managerial positions. Among OECD countries, at least 70 % of students in Chile, Israel, <lb/>Mexico and Turkey expect to work in occupations requiring a university degree at entry (Figure 1, the top <lb/>map). In Greece, Portugal, Iceland, Korea and Spain over 60% of students also hope to enter highly skilled <lb/>managerial and professional careers. In all of these countries the proportions of students oriented to high <lb/>attainment are larger than the OECD average of 55%. On the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of <lb/>high school students planning similar careers in the more stratified education systems of Switzerland, <lb/>Germany, Austria, as well as in Sweden, does not exceed 40%. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>Figure 1. Students&apos; career plans. Proportion of adolescents expecting occupations in top ISC)88 major groups <lb/>and average ISEI occupational status scores by country <lb/>Source: PISA 2006. For estimates see Appendix Table I <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>22. <lb/>Occupational ambition levels are yet higher among partner countries and economies. On average <lb/>more than 64 % students in these countries intend to work in the top two major categories of ISCO88. No <lb/>less than 70% of PISA respondents in Kyrgyzstan, Uruguay, Colombia, Tunisia, Azerbaijan and Jordan <lb/>expect to be working in one of these occupational categories. Over 60% of their peers in Brazil, Lithuania, <lb/>Indonesia, Chinese Taipei, Macao-China, Russian Federation, Thailand, Argentina and Bulgaria share <lb/>similar ambitions. Only in Croatia the proportion of students hoping to become highly educated <lb/>professionals and managers is merely 40%. <lb/>23. <lb/>The differences in ambition levels between students across countries can be attributed to a <lb/>number of factors. These include students&apos; family characteristics and academic performance but also the <lb/>specific national labour market conditions and the features of national education systems which provide <lb/>different options for 15 year olds (Sikora and Saha, 2010). However, before considering, more <lb/>systematically, the combined effects of these influences it is necessary to explore the descriptive <lb/>dimensions of career plans&apos; distributions across countries in greater depth. <lb/>24. <lb/>When the contrast between the most ambitious students and their peers is redefined to include the <lb/>proportions of adolescents hoping to attain not only professional and managerial but also associate <lb/>professional occupations, the gap between OECD and partner countries and economies converges (Figure <lb/>1, the middle map). On average 79% of students in partner countries and economies and 75% of their peers <lb/>within the OECD harbour hopes of working in one of the jobs listed in the top three major groups of <lb/>ISCO88. Over 80 % students from Chile, United States, Portugal, Korea, Mexico, Turkey and Israel report <lb/>such plans. The lowest proportions of students electing careers of this type are found in Japan, Finland, <lb/>Hungary, Switzerland, Austria and Germany where they do not exceed 60%. <lb/>25. <lb/>Among partner countries and economies, these top three major occupational groups account for <lb/>over 85% of choices in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Colombia, Brazil, Tunisia, and Jordan (Figure 1, the <lb/>middle map). At the other end of the spectrum, no fewer than 65% of adolescent Romanians and Croats <lb/>expect similar careers for themselves. <lb/>26. <lb/>A strong focus on entering the most highly skilled professions among students in less prosperous <lb/>countries is most evident when plans are presented on the ISEI scale of occupational status, the scores of <lb/>which range from a low 10 to a high 90 (Ganzeboom and Treiman 1996) (Figure 1, the bottom map). <lb/>These scores have been derived in an analysis of cross-national data in a manner which optimises the <lb/>predictive power of education with respect to income for each occupation (Ganzeboom and Treiman, <lb/>1996). The advantage of status scores over ISCO88 categories is that ISEI conveys the information about <lb/>finer differences in the required education and typical financial returns to particular occupations. For <lb/>instance, judges in courts of law receive the top score of 90, medical doctors receive 88 points while <lb/>university professors are denoted by the score of 77 in contrast to dancers and choreographers with 64 and <lb/>social work professionals with only 51 points. <lb/>27. <lb/>On the ISEI scale the plans of students in OECD countries averaged 58 points compared to 63 <lb/>points on average for students in partner countries and economies. Adolescents in less affluent countries <lb/>e.g. Mexico and Turkey and partner countries Brazil, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan, Tunisia, Azerbaijan and <lb/>Colombia typically hoped to enter the top professional and managerial employment with ISEI scores of 65 <lb/>or higher (Figure 1, the bottom map). <lb/>28. <lb/>Quite the reverse was the case in Switzerland, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic, where <lb/>average scores were around 52. The lower levels of occupational expectations found in these countries are <lb/>consistent with the allocation theory which emphasises that students in these countries are sorted into <lb/>separate types of academic or vocational schools before they are 15 years of age (Buchmann and Park <lb/>2009). Students who are already in educational tracks which do not lead to professional and managerial <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>employment thus report their expectations in accordance with their educational placement. This aligns with <lb/>more realistic feedback received at school on their performance (Buchmann and Park, 2009; Kerckhoff, <lb/>1977). In contrast, students in the more open, comprehensive systems can longer relish hopes for highly <lb/>skilled employment, even if not all expectants have realistic chances of attaining their goals. <lb/>29. <lb/>In addition to the apparent curbing influence of early tracking and sorting at schools, high levels <lb/>of economic prosperity within countries also appear to be aligned with lower levels of occupational <lb/>ambitions. In countries with high levels of development, participation in school at age 15 is nearly <lb/>universal, while in less prosperous countries participation rates at age 15 are lower. This is a factor that <lb/>contributes to country level differences in occupational ambitions (Sikora and Saha, 2010). Nevertheless, <lb/>the participation rates alone do not fully explain the cross-country differences in career plans in PISA. <lb/>Gender differences in student career expectations <lb/>30. <lb/>One of the most prominent features of research on adolescent expectations based on PISA is the <lb/>attempt to explain widespread gender differences, with girls generally reporting higher status expectations <lb/>than boys (Buchmann and Dalton, 2002; Sikora and Saha, 2009). <lb/>31. <lb/>Appendix Tables 1, 2 and 3 show that in almost all PISA participating countries girls expect to <lb/>work in higher status jobs than boys. Regardless of the manner in which occupational status is measured, <lb/>be it in ISEI scores or ISCO major groups, the difference between the proportions of girls and boys is <lb/>positive in most countries and in many, the difference in favour of girls is substantial (Marks 2010; Sikora <lb/>and Saha, 2009) (and Appendix Tables 1,2,3). <lb/>32. <lb/>The finding that girls surpass boys in educational attainment and thus in hopes and plans for high <lb/>status careers is often interpreted as a sign that gender inequalities have diminished or even reversed <lb/>direction (Blossfeld &amp; Shavit, 1993: 77; Marks, 2008). Yet the occupational segregation literature (Charles <lb/>and Grusky, 2004) points out that gender inequalities must be understood not only in terms of vertical <lb/>differentiation, captured by status and income associated with particular occupations, but also with respect <lb/>to the horizontal segregation, which denotes gender specific niches persisting at each level of the vertical <lb/>dimension in the employment structure. <lb/>33. <lb/>There exists evidence of a marked disparity between adolescent expectations and adult <lb/>attainments in Australia (Sikora and Saha, 2011), the United States (Reynolds et al, 2006) and the United <lb/>Kingdom (Croll 2008). However, the relative differences in the extent to which boys and girls are able to <lb/>realise their early goals have received little attention and are yet to be systematically explored. <lb/>34. <lb/>To provide a glimpse of the actual occupational titles which appeal to students of both genders <lb/>Table 1 presents a selection from the lists of the ten most attractive career choices compiled separately for <lb/>boys and girls. While it contains no information on the rank of particular occupations in each country, it <lb/>presents a mosaic of careers particularly popular among PISA 2006 respondents. <lb/>35. <lb/>Boys and girls expect careers in different fields across countries. &quot;Medical doctor&quot; is the only <lb/>occupational title mentioned by both boys and girls in more than 25 OECD countries. While girls <lb/>nominated &quot; lawyers &quot; as their preferred career in 25 OECD countries and 17 partner countries and <lb/>economies, boys did so in ten OECD countries and ten partner countries and economies. The same pattern <lb/>is observable for &quot; authors journalists and other writers &quot; and &quot; decorators and commercial designers &quot; . <lb/></body>

Other professions favoured by girls include nursing, teaching, <lb/>veterinary science and psychology, often referred to as &quot;nurturance-oriented&quot; careers (Charles and <lb/>Grusky, 2004: 15). Other than that, many girls expect to work as authors and artists. <lb/>38. <lb/>In contrast, the preferences of young men concentrate on professional sport, car mechanics, <lb/>computing, engineering, and law enforcement (Table 1). Cooking also appears on the list of ten most <lb/>popular occupations among male students. In Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Indonesia government-<lb/>related careers are particularly popular among both genders. In these Asian countries public service is <lb/>an occupational choice that trumps in popularity even the universally coveted law and medicine. <lb/>Dispersion in career plans across countries <lb/>39. <lb/>Students&apos; plans differ across countries also with respect to the diversity of career paths <lb/>forming a spectrum of young people&apos;s choices. Although teenagers generally tend to choose a career <lb/>from a relatively limited set of options (Marini and Greenberger, 1978; Patton and Creed, 2007), a <lb/>particular concentration of plans on very few occupational titles may be of concern to vocational <lb/>counsellors. Students&apos; career development knowledge may also vary by gender and thus it is important <lb/>to know whether, male and female students see themselves in equally diverse ranges of career options. <lb/>To this end Figures 2a and 2b show the proportions of students of both sexes, who reported, as their <lb/>intended career, one of the ten most popular occupations amongst their peers of the same sex. The <lb/>larger the proportion within a country, the higher the concentration of students&apos; expectations. <lb/>40. <lb/>It is plausible to expect that the variety in students&apos; range of choices is related to the range of <lb/>opportunities in the labour markets, known to adolescents from their everyday experience. From the <lb/>childhood development perspective the knowledge of potential career options among 15 year olds is <lb/>relatively comprehensive and realistic (Hartung, Porfeli, and Vondracek, 2008; Super, 1980; Tracey <lb/>and Sodano, 2008). In other words, students&apos; career plans index, at least partly, the &quot;knowledge of &apos;the <lb/>real world&apos;&quot; (Kerckhoff, 1976: 371) as much as youth motivation. <lb/>41. <lb/>For instance in more affluent countries, where local labour markets avail a variety of manual <lb/>and non-manual occupational pathways which are comparable with respect to expected autonomy, <lb/>financial returns and employment security, students&apos; expectations may be diverse. In contrast, in <lb/>poorer, less developed societies which experience more inequality and where returns to advanced <lb/>education remain high (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004), students&apos; plans may be more concentrated <lb/>on the secure and well rewarded managerial and professional careers, even though for many hopefuls <lb/>the chances of realising such ambitious goals are at best slim. Figures 2a and 2b lend support to this <lb/>conjecture as, overall, the concentration of career plans in partner countries, which include many less <lb/>affluent economies, is higher than the corresponding figures in the most prosperous of OECD nations. <lb/>42. <lb/>Furthermore, there are also systematic differences in the concentration of career plans <lb/>between genders. In most countries a higher proportion of girls is attracted by the ten most popular <lb/>career choices among peers of the same sex (the OECD average is approx. 50%). In contrast, boys&apos; <lb/>career plans tend to be less concentrated (the corresponding average is 36%). It is possible to attribute <lb/>these differences to the fact that historically women have been concentrated in the non-manual sector <lb/>of employment in which only high level professional occupations are really attractive employment <lb/>options. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/>15 <lb/>Figure 2a.

			<body>43. <lb/>In contrast young men in many countries can look forward to attractive employment in both <lb/>manual and non-manual sectors where men work as managers and professionals as well as, often well <lb/>rewarded and enjoying considerable work autonomy, tradesmen and craftsmen. Another possibility is <lb/>that gender ideologies in many countries limit the knowledge of the diversity in career options among <lb/>girls (Marini and Greenberger, 1978). <lb/>44. <lb/>Moreover, it is possible that girls take into account more than boys, their future family <lb/>obligations when planning careers (Looker and Magee, 2000). This itself, however, does not explain <lb/>why girls&apos; preferences are more concentrated, because girls&apos; most preferred jobs in particular countries <lb/>do not comprise exclusively &quot;family-friendly&quot; options. The cursory review, presented here, attests to <lb/>the systematic differences in the career-related imagery embraced by adolescents of both genders. <lb/>These divides are illustrated by the contrasts in particular types of science-related career preferences <lb/>discussed below. <lb/>Science-related careers: vertical and horizontal segregation by gender <lb/>45. <lb/>PISA provides an opportunity to analyse both the vertical and the horizontal dimensions of <lb/>gender segregation in students&apos; career plans. There is vertical segregation in career plans in favour of <lb/>girls, Overall, girls expect higher status employment compared to what is typically expected by boys. <lb/>However, thanks to the level of detail of the data collected in PISA on science related careers, it is <lb/>possible to contrast gender differences across different fields of science. Furthermore, the PISA 2006 <lb/>assessment focused on science and contains a wealth of data on science performance and student <lb/>attitudes towards science as a field of study and employment. <lb/>46. <lb/>While decades ago girls were expected to underperform relative to boys (Marini and <lb/>Greenberger, 1978), in recent cohorts, girls in many countries have caught up with or even overtaken <lb/>their male peers in scientific competence (Hill, Corbett, and Rose, 2010; OECD 2007a). A better <lb/>performance among girls, however, does not necessarily mean that girls will desire to pursue science <lb/>related careers more than boys (Looker and Magee, 2000). <lb/>47. <lb/>Before exploring this issue further, it must be noted that any analysis of gender differences <lb/>in preferences for a science career hinges on a specific definition of science. For instance, where <lb/>subfields of science are distinguished, it is often found that women have made significant inroads into <lb/>the careers in biological and agricultural sciences but continue to be dramatically underrepresented in <lb/>computing and engineering (Hill, Corbett, and Rose, 2010). <lb/>48. <lb/>The definition of science-related careers applied in this paper follows the PISA 2006 <lb/>questionnaire, which specified that &quot;many jobs involve science – not just the traditional &apos;scientist&apos;. <lb/>Careers like engineer (involving physics), weather forecaster (involving earth science), optician <lb/>(involving biology and physics), and medical doctors (involving the medical sciences) are all <lb/>examples of science-related careers&quot;. In this paper, science-related careers comprise selected ISCO88 <lb/>titles (listed in Appendix 2, Section A) from the first three major occupational groups. 1 Occupational <lb/>titles from major groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 have not been included. <lb/>49. <lb/>The following section commences from an overview of gender preferences for thus defined <lb/>science-related employment. It then proceeds to examine two subfields of science-related careers, <lb/>computing and engineering versus health-related sciences. <lb/>1. <lb/>PISA 2006 included a list of science careers in ISCO-88 (OECD 2007: Table A10.4). The list used in <lb/>this document follows closely this list but introduces a number of changes. For example, code 2442 <lb/> &quot; Sociologists, anthropologists, etc professionals &quot; is no longer included while code 3141 &quot; Ships <lb/>engineers &quot; is included. Any choice will be inherently arbitrary and the inclusion or exclusion of a <lb/>particular occupation is likely to have little impact on the final results given the small proportions of <lb/>students who choose a particular 4 digit ISCO code. <lb/></body>

			<body>50. <lb/>Science careers are attractive to adolescents in many countries (Figure 3). The highest <lb/>proportions of students who intend to work in some science-related occupation are, among OECD <lb/>countries, in the United States, Israel, Mexico, Portugal and Chile, where at least 45% of students <lb/>report that they expect to pursue such a career. Equally high or even higher levels of interest in <lb/>science careers are also present in Brazil, Thailand, Colombia and Jordan. In contrast, in Korea, <lb/>Hungary, Finland and a partner country Montenegro science seems less alluring to students than <lb/>elsewhere, attracting only about 20% of choices. <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>51. <lb/>Countries in which science-related careers are most popular are not necessarily the ones <lb/>where most students achieve high scores in science tests (OECD, 2007a: Table 2.1c). In Mexico, <lb/>Portugal and Poland, among the OECD countries, students are keen on pursuing science-related career <lb/>although their performance in science is well behind the leading Finland, Canada, Japan and New <lb/>Zealand. In the countries with highest science performance levels, fewer students are interested in <lb/>science as their preferred career option. Similarly, among partner countries and economies, the <lb/>proportions of students interested in science-related employment are moderate in Hong-Kong-China <lb/>or Chinese Taipei relative to Colombia or, for example, Jordan. This is despite the fact that the former <lb/>two countries have students who, on average, obtain strong results in science while the latter pair of <lb/>countries comprises student populations with mostly average science performance. Such disparities <lb/>may be indicative of students&apos; relatively poor knowledge of the prerequisites and investment required <lb/>for the highly specialised science occupations. Alternatively, the perceptions of a high prestige or <lb/>financial returns associated with these jobs might generate an interest which is as unrealistic as it is <lb/>widespread. <lb/>52. <lb/>Overall, when science-related career plans are contrasted between genders in various OECD <lb/>countries, a complex and varied pattern emerges. In some nations the proportions of girls and boys <lb/>who plan employment in these occupations are similar (lower parts of Figure 3). In many countries <lb/>one gender dominates the other in opting for science as the area of preferred future employment. <lb/>There is no apparent systematic pattern, however, in who dominates whom (upper parts of Figure 3). <lb/>Girls beat boys in their enthusiasm for science jobs in the United States, Canada, Iceland, Norway, the <lb/>Netherlands and New Zealand but in Italy, Poland and Korea boys enthused by science outnumber <lb/>girls. <lb/>Expectations of careers in computing and engineering <lb/>53. <lb/>While this fusion of patterns could be perceived as an indication of progressing, albeit at a <lb/>dissimilar pace in different countries, integration of student choices, it actually results from grouping <lb/>together various types of science careers that have a gender-specific appeal. This is illustrated in <lb/>Figures 4 and 5 which present the proportions of boys and girls who aim specifically at entering <lb/>engineering and computing and health-science-related employment. 2 Careers in engineering and <lb/>computing attract relatively few girls. Among OECD countries, on average less than five percent of <lb/>girls contemplate embarking on this path of employment (Appendix 1 Table 5). In partner countries <lb/>and economies the corresponding average is over six percent. This is even though the definition of <lb/>computing and engineering employed here extends to include fields like architecture, which is rarely <lb/>considered to be one of the typically &quot;masculine&quot; jobs (Appendix 2, Section B). There is much cross-<lb/>country variation in the numbers of students opting for future employment in this field, ranging from <lb/>relatively high proportions in Poland, Slovenia, Mexico, Jordan and Colombia to very low numbers in <lb/>the Netherlands, Finland, Azerbaijan and Montenegro. <lb/>54. <lb/>Yet, the most striking feature of these distributions is that in almost no country does the <lb/>number of girls thinking of computing and engineering as their future career choice exceed the <lb/>number of boys. The singular exception to this trend is Montenegro. Moreover, the ratios of boys to <lb/>girls are quite large in most OECD and many partner countries and economies. On average, there are <lb/>almost four times as many boys as there are girls expecting employment in engineering and <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2. <lb/>It is important to bear in mind that the categories of engineering/computing and health utilised in this <lb/>analysis do not include all science-related occupations. These two categories account for about 75% <lb/>of plans for science-related employment and some science occupations such as &quot;mathematician&quot;, <lb/>&quot;physicist&quot; or &quot;psychologist&quot; are neither in the engineering/computing nor in the health category. <lb/>Nevertheless it is possible to relate gender differences in these two fields to the overall patterns of <lb/>segregation previously found in studies of employment or tertiary enrolments. <lb/></note>

			<body>computing within OECD and close to three times as many boys as girls in partner countries and <lb/>economies. <lb/>Expectations of careers in health services <lb/>55. <lb/>The pattern of preferences for health-science careers by gender is a mirror image of the <lb/>expectations related to employment in engineering and computing. Just as boys outnumbered girls in <lb/>their enthusiasm for computing and engineering, girls who yearn for a career in health and medicine <lb/>outnumber boys, without a single exception among countries. It is noteworthy that this holds even <lb/>after nurses and midwives are excluded from the list of health-related careers, so the gender <lb/>imbalance in preferences for health-related careers is not brought about solely by the traditional over-<lb/>representation of women in nursing and midwifery. <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>56. <lb/>The gender gap is particularly large in Austria, Norway and Switzerland in the OECD group <lb/>and Thailand, Latvia, and Russian Federation in the remaining countries. By contrast, boys and girls <lb/>in Mexico, Korea and Italy, as well as Bulgaria, Indonesia and Hong Kong are closer to their peers of <lb/>the opposite sex in their intentions to pursue careers in health. Nevertheless, this does not mean <lb/>gender-integration of plans but only a smaller between-gender gap. <lb/>What explains the horizontal segregation of adolescent career plans? <lb/>57. <lb/>While the dramatic underrepresentation of women in computing and engineering has been <lb/>recognised and attracted attention in particular countries, the PISA data reveal an almost universal <lb/>presence of the gender segregation in employment expectations of youth. This segregation is present <lb/>already at 15 years of age, in a large number of countries which differ markedly with respect to <lb/>economic contexts and the organisation of their education systems. <lb/>58. <lb/>Biological explanations of the persisting gender differences are particularly inept in <lb/>accounting why women should excel in biological sciences and plan to work in many demanding, <lb/>health-science fields (Figure 5) but at the same time shun computing and engineering jobs. <lb/>59. <lb/>Charles and Grusky propose the concept of cultural gender essentialism, as a possible <lb/>explanation of these patterns (2004; Charles and Bradley, 2009). Women and men&apos;s preferences and <lb/>subsequently employment paths are rooted in cultural and institutional phenomena. The ideology of <lb/>gender essentialism represents women as &quot;more competent than men in service, nurturance, and social <lb/>interaction.&quot; (Charles and Grusky, 2004: 15). To the extent to which health related occupations are <lb/>culturally construed as involving more tasks related to these domains, the ideology of gender <lb/>essentialism may indeed be at the root of persisting differences between the gender-specific imageries <lb/>of desirable and a fulfilling careers. <lb/>60. <lb/>The sections that follow systematically examine a number of possible reasons for the gender <lb/>gap in career plans: differences in science performance, in course-taking, in family background, in the <lb/>transfer of tastes and preferences within a family along gender lines, in students&apos; perceptions of their <lb/>capacity for success in science and their knowledge of what is required for a science career. Many of <lb/>these factors affect the variation between boys and girls, suggesting possibilities for future policy <lb/>initiatives aimed at a better utilisation of youth talent. Nevertheless, the gap between girls and boys <lb/>remains unexplained by these factors, which, together with its universal presence across countries, <lb/>points to global gender ideologies as the most promising explanation. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES: WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE GENDER GAP? <lb/>Academic success, family background and career plans <lb/>61. <lb/>For over three decades studies in educational psychology, sociology and other social <lb/>sciences demonstrated that the two most influential groups of factors which shape youth motivation <lb/>and ambition were family background and academic performance (Haller, Luther, Meier, and <lb/>Ohlendorf 1974; Hauser and Grusky, 1988). <lb/>62. <lb/>The meritocratic ideology, central in the ideals governing modern mass education, <lb/>prioritises ability and effort as the sole criteria which should underpin advancement in the school <lb/>system and in the labour market. The underlying principle of egalitarianism stipulates that gender, <lb/>ethnicity, socio-economic status and other structural differences between students should have no <lb/>direct effect on their quality of education and the chances of advancement in life. Even if certain <lb/>differences between students in these groups are experienced in the education system, they should <lb/>answer to the &quot;different but equal&quot; principle and neither lead to any tangible disadvantages for <lb/>particular groups of students nor to constrain their individual preferences. Therefore to the extent to <lb/>which meritocratic ideology and practices have been successfully instilled across the educational <lb/>systems in the world, academic performance should be the key determinant of students&apos; educational <lb/>and occupational plans. <lb/>63. <lb/>Indeed, recent research based on PISA surveys (Marks, 2010; Sikora and Saha, 2009) <lb/>documents a positive relationship between high levels of academic performance and ambitious <lb/>occupational goals. This relationship is, in all likelihood, one of mutual reinforcement, that is high <lb/>level academic performance leads to ambitious occupational goals which, in turn, inspire more effort <lb/>in educational pursuits, save for the instances where students have poor knowledge of educational <lb/>credentials required to enter particular careers. <lb/>64. <lb/>But academic performance is by no means the only strong booster of ambitious plans. <lb/>Theories of allocation, risk aversion and elite reproduction (Bourdieu, 1984; Bourdieu, 1986; Breen <lb/>and Yaish, 2006; Kerckhoff, 1976) posit that even in the era of modern meritocratic education the <lb/>children of the highly educated parents in highly skilled employment benefit from more generous <lb/>endowments in cultural, economic and social capital. These endowments advance the children of elite <lb/>to experience educational success beyond the levels typical for their equally academically able but <lb/>more socially disadvantaged peers. The risk aversion theory, backed up with some empirical studies <lb/>(Breen and Yaish, 2006; Golthorpe, 2007), proposes that the children in higher status families at <lb/>minimum expect to attain as high an educational and occupational position as their parents. Therefore, <lb/>such children continue their education beyond compulsory years, even when their academic <lb/>performance is only moderately successful. Moreover, such children, taking their parents&apos; attainment <lb/>as a natural benchmark, are likely to be firmly oriented towards high status occupational employment <lb/>for themselves. By contrast, the children of lower status parents need much higher motivation or far <lb/>more academic success to be enticed to continue in education past the compulsory threshold. <lb/>Regardless of these differences, in strongly meritocratic systems both groups of students should <lb/>advance primarily through academic performance, that is, either effort or talent. In these systems <lb/>occupational expectations should be linked more strongly to academic success than to family capital. <lb/>65. <lb/>Most PISA 2006 participating countries appear to have education systems which closely <lb/>approach so defined meritocracy as students&apos; career plans in most places are better predicted by <lb/>academic performance than by family economic, social and cultural resources.

			<body>regression coefficients from a two level random intercept model in which students&apos; expectations <lb/>expressed in the ISEI status scores have been regressed on their performance in science and their <lb/>family of origin&apos;s economic, social and cultural status. In this instance ISEI scores have been used to <lb/>conserve space as the patterns for students who wish to work in particular science fields are <lb/>essentially the same. For comparability the independent variables, that is, the science scale <lb/>performance scores and the status of family home, have been standardised to a mean of zero and the <lb/>standard deviation of one across all OECD countries. These standardised coefficients can be <lb/>interpreted as the change in average ISEI occupational status score which is associated with a change <lb/>of one standard deviation on either students&apos; science performance or the family status scale. <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>66. <lb/>In most countries science performance is a stronger predictor of high status occupational <lb/>expectations (Figure 6) than students&apos; socio-cultural and economic capital. This is the case for boys <lb/>and girls. But there are some exceptions from this pattern as the economic, social and cultural capital <lb/>of a student&apos;s family predict as well as school performance future career plans in Japan for students of <lb/>both genders. In Kyrgyzstan and Brazil the performance of girls is unrelated to their occupational <lb/>expectations which is atypical. <lb/>67. <lb/>Notwithstanding the stronger impact of science performance than family background on <lb/>student career expectations, in many countries family background nonetheless has a bearing on the <lb/>expected status of students&apos; future employment net of students&apos; performance. As Marks (2010) pointed <lb/>out in his analysis of career plans in PISA 2000, the strong version of meritocracy hypothesis would <lb/>require a complete absence of the family background effects. Despite the undeniable progress of <lb/>meritocracy in education systems across the world, students from advantageous home environments <lb/>continue to expect better jobs than their equally able peers from less privileged homes. <lb/>68. <lb/>Regardless of the obvious relationship between the cultures of meritocracy and <lb/>egalitarianism and their apparent prevalence in most countries, the horizontal segregation of career <lb/>plans by gender persists. While across countries most students are oriented towards the managerial <lb/>and professional employment and high achievers are particularly ambitious, the fields of employment <lb/>that attract young men and women continue to be distinct. <lb/>Gender socialisation and career plans <lb/>69. <lb/>Notwithstanding the consensus over the declining gender differentiation in socialisation <lb/>practices within home and school environments, the proposition that a child is influenced more by the <lb/>parent of the same sex has received attention and even some support in recent research (Kleinjans, <lb/>2010; Marks, 2008). The key expectation of the same-sex-socialisation theory is that daughters are <lb/>influenced and inspired by their mothers&apos; rather than their fathers&apos; attainments. Likewise, sons are <lb/>more likely to look up to and follow into their fathers, rather than their mothers&apos; footsteps. Within this <lb/>perspective family role-modelling processes work most effectively along gender division lines and <lb/>thus for instance while the daughters of engineer fathers might be more likely to contemplate a career <lb/>in engineering than adolescents who have no engineers in their family circle, the daughters of female <lb/>engineers should be particularly well poised to consider a similar career for themselves. The key <lb/>foundation for this preference is the child&apos;s &quot;expert&quot; understanding of not only the content of the <lb/>parent&apos;s job but also of day-to-day strategies which enable success in combining the heavy human <lb/>capital investments necessary for these careers with gendered roles and identities outside of the world <lb/>of work. The gender socialisation hypothesis is potentially attractive where persistent differences <lb/>between boys and girls, as these occurring in career plans, cannot be explained by biological theories, <lb/>the differences in sex-specific academic strengths or an absence of policies designed to foster <lb/>egalitarian gender attitudes. But it must be noted that it is not optimal for understanding the situation <lb/>of youth in single parent families or the families with parents of the same sex. <lb/>70. <lb/>Prior research which sought to establish whether academic results of boys and girls <lb/>participating in PISA surveys were more influenced by the characteristics of fathers or mothers found <lb/>at best a modest support for the sex-socialisation hypothesis (Marks, 2008). Nevertheless, in several <lb/>countries, it could not be entirely dismissed. The PISA 2006 report found little or no relationship <lb/>between expectations of employment in science and having a parent employed in one of science fields <lb/>(OECD, 2007a). In contrast to this finding Figure 7 below highlights that, in many countries, parents&apos; <lb/>occupational profiles are positively associated with their children&apos;s plans to pursue employment in <lb/>similar areas. <lb/>71. <lb/>Figure 7 displays coefficients from two-level logit models predicting the likelihood of <lb/>planning employment in computing or engineering or in health services as a function of mother and <lb/></body>

			<body>father&apos;s employment in these fields. The model incorporates only two independent variables as the <lb/>total influence of fathers and mothers&apos; characteristics is pertinent here, regardless of the mechanisms <lb/>through which parents in particular professions sway and support their children in considering similar <lb/>career paths for themselves. <lb/>72. <lb/>Overall, the cross-national evidence in support for gender socialisation hypothesis with <lb/>regard to occupational plans is moderate but non-negligible. Boys follow in the footsteps of their <lb/>fathers more often that girls (Figure 7). In a number of countries, for instance in Japan, Mexico or <lb/>Poland, having either parent working in health enhances the children&apos;s interest in this field regardless <lb/>of the sex of the parent. The stronger influence of fathers&apos; employment in health on their daughters&apos; <lb/>plans in Italy, Poland or Lithuania contrasts with the logic of the gender socialisation theory but is in <lb/>accordance with the expectation of within-family transfer of tastes and preferences for particular types <lb/>of carers. By contrast, in many countries, e.g. Bulgaria, Colombia or Estonia, the profile of parents&apos; <lb/>employment was unrelated to the career expectations which students reported in PISA 2006. <lb/>73. <lb/>On the whole there is stronger evidence of a transfer of tastes between fathers and sons than <lb/>mothers and daughters which corresponds to the findings of studies concerned with educational <lb/>attainment (Kleinjans, 2010; Marks, 2008). The number of countries where this relationship for men <lb/>in the family is significant is larger than the number of countries with the corresponding effects for the <lb/>women. <lb/>74. <lb/>The link between parents&apos;, particularly fathers&apos; employment in health, and children&apos;s hopes <lb/>of entering a career in health and medicine is stronger in a large number of countries than the <lb/>intergenerational transfer of preferences for computing and engineering. What impedes the attempts to <lb/>test the gender socialisation hypothesis with regard to the within-family transfer of tastes for <lb/>engineering and computing is an almost total absence of engineers and computing scientists among <lb/>mothers in the sample. On average the proportion of mother engineers does not exceed half a percent. <lb/>By contrast, there are between 1% and 3 % of fathers who work in these occupations. Figure 7 shows <lb/>only coefficients in countries in which at least 0.5 % of parents of each sex were in each group of <lb/>occupations of interest, and, moreover, in which there were at least 5 students whose expected career <lb/>corresponded to employment held by their parent of the same sex. As there are very few mothers <lb/>employed in engineering and computing, even the application of these liberal criteria led to a dearth of <lb/>the information necessary for establishing any relationship between mothers&apos; employment and their <lb/>daughters&apos; plans. The influence of parents&apos; employment in health on children&apos;s occupational plans is <lb/>easier to ascertain, thanks to the higher proportions of both mothers and fathers working in the <lb/>relevant occupations. <lb/>75. <lb/>Alternatively, the very low counts of engineer mothers in the PISA sample could be seen as <lb/>evidence in support of gender socialisation hypothesis. A shortage of female role models within the <lb/>family circle who &quot;normalise&quot; the perception that engineering and computing as a domain fully <lb/>accessible to women, may well prevent girls from planning this type of employment. In contrast, in a <lb/>number of countries, the coefficients depicting a son&apos;s preference for engineering and computing as a <lb/>function of his father&apos;s work in these fields is positive and significant. Hence, in more locations, boys <lb/>seem to have higher chances than girls of being exposed, within their own family circle, to the <lb/>experiences and role models which normalise engineering and computing as a professional activity <lb/>appropriate for their sex. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/>27 <lb/>Figure 7.

			<body>Can science performance explain differences in career plans of boys and girls? <lb/>76. <lb/>The assessment of science performance in PISA 2006 showed that in many countries boys <lb/>performed on a par with girls (OECD, 2007a). This was the case, for instance, in United States, <lb/>Canada or Poland. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, Denmark or Mexico girls&apos; science performance <lb/>lagged somewhat behind that of their male counterparts. Finally, in yet other countries, girls <lb/>outperformed boys in science, as for instance in Jordan, Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece (OECD, 2007a). <lb/>In countries where there are no gender disparities in science competence, there can be no relationship <lb/>between them and gender differences in career expectations. However, does science performance play <lb/>a role in driving career expectations in countries where boys and girls do not perform equally well in <lb/>science? <lb/>77. <lb/>The goal of the analysis in this section is to ascertain the extent to which controlling for <lb/>differentials in science performance and course taking can explain the gap in the interest boys and <lb/>girls have in engineering or computing (Tables 2a and 2b) and health-sciences (Tables 3a and 3b). <lb/>Apart from student science performance and familial environments, one factor which received <lb/>attention as a possible driver of gender differences in career preferences is the differential course <lb/>taking in upper years of secondary high-school (Xie and Shauman 2003). <lb/>78. <lb/>Some researchers argued that young women begin opting out of advanced mathematics and <lb/>science courses at quite early stages in their education and thus simply do not possess the appropriate <lb/>credentials at the time when entry to science university degrees would be possible (Xie and Shauman <lb/>2003). However, recent evidence from the USA does not support this hypothesis. Throughout the <lb/>1980s and 1990s average gender differences in math and science performance were small but <lb/>American boys were markedly more likely than American girls to be among the top 5% maths and <lb/>science achievers. However, neither difference was consequential for the gender gap in expectations <lb/>to complete a science-related degree (Xie and Shauman 2003). <lb/>79. <lb/>PISA 2006 has the information on students&apos; participation in compulsory and optional <lb/>courses in general science, biology, chemistry and physics. Each student was asked about his or her <lb/>participation in such courses in 2006 and the preceding year, i.e. in 2005. Although the data on <lb/>course-taking are not strictly comparable between countries due to the curricular and program <lb/>differences, it is possible to construct a measure of course participation which is suitable for <lb/>comparisons between genders within each country. After initial analyses, in which all questions on <lb/>course-taking were treated as separate variables, the information on compulsory and optional course <lb/>participation in both years was combined to create a variable indicating exposure to each subject area. <lb/>This variable ranged from zero, if a student took no compulsory or optional courses in the year of <lb/>assessment or the previous year, to four, if both types of courses were taken in both years. <lb/>80. <lb/>Coefficients from two-level random intercept logit models are presented in each table for the <lb/>OECD (in tables annotated with an &quot;a&quot;) and partner countries (in tables annotated with a &quot;b&quot;). The <lb/>science performance scale and the variables depicting course-taking in particular areas of science are <lb/>control variables in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b below. <lb/>81. <lb/>The change in the gender gap in students&apos; expectations due to control variables can be <lb/>observed by comparing the first two left-hand columns in each table. For instance, in the Slovak <lb/>Republic, where the proportions of boys and girls who expect a career in engineering or computing <lb/>are very different, the gender coefficient changes from the baseline Model 1 &quot;-2.18&quot; to &quot;-2.06&quot; in <lb/>Model 2 (Table 2a). The latter model can be interpreted as representing a hypothetical situation in <lb/>which boys and girls do not differ at all with respect to science performance or science subjects taken <lb/>at school. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>science performance or course participation between sexes, although it is the higher achievers in <lb/>science who do contemplate such careers at all. This is the case in all OECD countries. <lb/>83. <lb/>The order of countries in Table 2a follows the decreasing gender gap. While, within the <lb/>OECD, in the highly differentiated education systems of the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, and the <lb/>internally differentiated the USA and the United Kingdom have students with the most sex-segregated <lb/>preferences for engineering, the gap between sexes in Israel, Estonia and Iceland is considerably <lb/>smaller. In Iceland the odds of expecting a career in engineering for girls are 0.48 (e -0.73 =0.48). This is <lb/>considerably more than the figure for the Slovak Republic (e -2.18 =0.11), but this estimate changes very <lb/>little after the introduction of the controls equivalent to the assumption that girls and boys have <lb/>identical science achievement and take the same science subjects. <lb/>84. <lb/>Good results in science assessment are positively correlated with an inclination towards <lb/>engineering or computing in all OECD countries. With respect to course-taking, students who do <lb/>courses in biology are less likely to consider engineering as their career path, what is indicated by the <lb/>mostly negative coefficients in Table 2a. Chemistry courses do not discourage students from <lb/>considering this type of employment in Italy, Spain, Estonia and Portugal, but make little difference in <lb/>most other places. Finally, the physics courses have a strong association with computing and <lb/>engineering careers in many of PISA 2006 participating countries, including Italy, the Slovak <lb/>Republic, Ireland and Korea. <lb/>85. <lb/>The relationship between science performance, course-participation and plans to work as an <lb/>engineer or computer scientist is similar in most partner countries. However, in contrast to the OECD, <lb/>where girls are less than boys prepared to consider this type of a career, girls in Montenegro, <lb/>Indonesia and Bulgaria are as willing as boys to enter engineering and computing. The gender gap <lb/>decreases a little after controlling for science performance and course taking in the UK, Hungary, <lb/>Germany and Belgium. Yet, in no country can the gender gap in expectations be entirely explained by <lb/>the differences in science performance and course-taking. <lb/>86. <lb/>In another analogy with the OECD patterns, specific high school courses seem conducive of <lb/>contemplating engineering as a career in only a handful countries. Biology, as a subject, decreases <lb/>chances of planning a career in engineering in Romania and Chinese Taipei. Physics courses raise an <lb/>interest in these careers in Croatia, Kyrgyzstan, Hong-Kong and Jordan. Tunisia is the only place <lb/>where more participation in physics courses actually decreases an interest in engineering. <lb/>87. <lb/>Tables 3a and 3b present the results of two-level logit regressions which predict <lb/>expectations of a career in health sciences from the same set of science-learning predictors. <lb/>88. <lb/>As previously shown, in all OECD countries, girls are far more interested in health-related <lb/>careers than boys, which is also the case when nursing and midwifery are excluded. The largest <lb/>difference between girls&apos; and boys&apos; interest in health is in Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands <lb/>where female students are more than five times as likely to plan employment in this field (e.g. for <lb/>Switzerland e 2.07 =7.92 which means that girls&apos; odds of expecting a career in health are almost eight <lb/>times larger than the odds for boys). The smallest gap in the enthusiasm for health as a career is <lb/>between boys and girls is in Mexico, Greece and Korea, but even there girls are nearly twice as likely <lb/>as boys to hope to enter the health sector as employees. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

Taking courses in general science also has a positive impact, illustrated by <lb/>coefficients greater than zero in many OECD countries, with the sole exception of Italy. Studying <lb/>biology and chemistry in high school correlates with students&apos; hopes to work in health, although the <lb/>relationship is not statistically significant in many nations. In contrast, if participation in physics <lb/>classes is statistically different from zero, its association with health career expectations tends to be <lb/>negative: physics rarely (only in France and Slovenia) goes together with the expectations of working <lb/>in health. <lb/>90. <lb/>The comparison of the gender coefficients in the baseline Model 1 and Model 2 with the <lb/>controls reveals that had girls not differed in any way from boys in their science performance and <lb/>patterns of course-taking, they would be even more keen on careers in health, surpassing the levels of <lb/>interest among boys by even greater ratios. <lb/>91. <lb/>This tendency is visible in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France and Hungary, to name only a <lb/>few countries. The largest predicted increase in the likelihood of girls expecting health careers, net of <lb/>performance and course participation is in Portugal where the odds of girls rise from 3.63 (which <lb/>equals e 1.29 ) to 5.16 (i.e. e 1.64 ). <lb/></body>

Largely independent of <lb/>these two factors, girls tend to shun computing and engineering, while boys are less attracted to health <lb/>professions. <lb/>94. <lb/>While much attention has been devoted to the underrepresentation of women in certain <lb/>fields of science (Hill, Corbett, and Rose, 2010; Howel, Blaisdell, Figueiredo, Gorham, and Hatch <lb/>2005; Matyas and Dix 1992), the question that emerges from this analysis is whether similar concern <lb/>should not be raised over the underrepresentation of young men among health career seekers. While it <lb/>is true that women continue to be crowded in the lower status health occupations (Grusky and Charles <lb/>2004) they have also been making inroads into top status health jobs. Supplementary analysis, not <lb/>shown here, in which midwifery and nursing were excluded from the list of health occupations, <lb/>confirms the much higher interest among girls in careers within this subfield of science. Given these <lb/>patterns in adolescent occupational expectations, it is possible that, in the future, the segregation of <lb/>men into computing, engineering and physics and women into biology, agriculture and health will not <lb/>only continue but further intensify. <lb/>95. <lb/>Another aspect of students&apos; educational experiences which may be relevant to expectations <lb/>is the timing of students&apos; branching out into vocational versus academic tracks. In many countries <lb/>women have fewer employment opportunities outside of the non-manual sector and thus there is a <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>marked overrepresentation of men in manual employment (Charles and Grusky, 2004). Therefore it is <lb/>likely that the gender divide evident in the labour market is likely to manifest as early as the first <lb/>educational transition in which students are divided between academic and vocationally oriented <lb/>programs. This is because the former are, down the track, related to non-manual and the latter to <lb/>manual employment. In some PISA-participating countries such a transition occurs before the age of <lb/>15 but in others students are not grouped into specific programs until later (PISA 2006 Database <lb/>Table 5.2). If boys are more likely than girls to populate vocational programs, this difference in <lb/>student distributions can affect the size of the gender gap in science-related career plans. <lb/>Occupational ambitions of students in vocational tracks at age 15 <lb/>96. <lb/>Students&apos; placement in either vocationally or pre-vocationally-oriented programs is a factor <lb/>defining not only educational but also career options. It is the first transition which encourages <lb/>students, for the first time in their lives to seriously and realistically assess their future educational and <lb/>occupational prospects. Students in vocational tracks are generally less oriented towards the highest <lb/>status occupations (Sikora and Saha, 2009) and thus, by definition, less likely to nominate, as their <lb/>goal, one of the science-related occupations in the top ISCO88 major groups. <lb/>97. <lb/>Table 4a presents the effects of placement in a vocational program on chances of planning <lb/>employment in engineering and computing or health (Models 2a). Because in some countries there are <lb/>no students in vocational tracks but instead the PISA sample comprises students at lower and higher <lb/>International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels (UNESCO, 2006), an alternative <lb/>version of the model (2b) utilises ISCED level as an indicator of important educational transitions <lb/>which might foster serious thinking about future educational and career prospects. The estimates are <lb/>provided only for countries in which at least 3 percent of students in the sample could be identified as <lb/>pre-vocational or vocational track placements. The influence of such placement on career plans <lb/>related to either health or engineering is present in only some countries. In Italy, Japan, Korea, <lb/>Mexico and the Slovak Republic vocational program placement is actually conducive of planning <lb/>employment in engineering or computing. In contrast in Belgium, it has a deterring impact. <lb/>98. <lb/>A vocational track placement decreases chances of expecting employment in health sciences <lb/>in all OECD countries where the relationship is statistically significant. In some contrast to the <lb/>vocational program, ISCED level has no systematic relationship to these particular career plans. <lb/>99. <lb/>The important feature of analyses in Tables 4a and 4b is that, as was the case with science <lb/>performance and course taking, vocational program placement makes no difference to the gender gap <lb/>in career expectations. This pattern is consistent across all countries, as even when point estimates for <lb/>the gender coefficients change, they do so by a relatively small margin. <lb/></body>

Overall, however, these variables make little contribution to <lb/>explaining the differences in preferences between boys and girls. <lb/>101. <lb/>Although there are no reasons to expect that the gender gap in expectations might be related <lb/>to the migrant status within student populations, it is informative to consider the contrast between the <lb/>migrant and native stock students as a supplement to the gender gap analysis. Before proceeding to <lb/>the examination of socio-psychological variables related to students&apos; confidence in individual abilities <lb/>and self-efficacy the next section focuses on the differences in plans of the migrant and native <lb/>students. <lb/>Occupational ambitions of migrant students <lb/>102. <lb/>Ethnic minority students, in country-specific studies, had been often found to have higher <lb/>than expected levels of aspirations and expectations (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005; Khattab 2003; <lb/></body>

			<body>Portes, McLeod, and Parker 1978; Wells, Bills, Park, and Chen 2007). Economic, social and cultural <lb/>resources of immigrant students are often limited compared with wealth and cultural competence of <lb/>locally born students. This is why in many countries which experience steadily rising inflows of <lb/>migration, foreign born students have been lagging in performance, compared with non-migrants <lb/>(OECD, 2007a: 175). Yet, American studies found that first and second generation migrant youth held <lb/> &quot; very high ambitions and hopes of the future &quot; (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005: 1088) despite systematic <lb/>evidence that migrant students underperform by a significant margin. This lower level of performance <lb/>has been confirmed in a number of PISA-participating countries whose student populations include <lb/>non-trivial numbers of migrant children (Ammermueller 2007; Heus, Dronkers, and Levels 2008; <lb/>OECD 2007a; Rangvid 2007). Since the PISA surveys include only students fluent in the national <lb/>language in which tests are administered, the actual effect of the migration status may be <lb/>underestimated and thus, in reality, even more substantial. <lb/>103. <lb/>In many OECD countries (Table 5a) migrant students have stronger hopes to secure science-<lb/>related employment than their locally born counterparts. In this analysis migrant students comprise <lb/>both those foreign born and those identified as second generation migrants, because preliminary <lb/>analyses which considered these groups separately revealed few differences between them. However, <lb/>only countries in which migrant students comprise at least 3 percent of the student population have <lb/>been included in the analysis in this section. <lb/>104. <lb/>Migrant students are also more interested in health-science employment in many OECD <lb/>countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and a number of countries in Western <lb/>Europe. This is consistent with the expectation that the children of migrants are particularly oriented <lb/>towards upward mobility and the attainment of high status jobs. This analysis suggests that science-<lb/>related employment might be the preferred path of advancement in a number of countries where <lb/>migrant students account for a non-trivial part of adolescent population. Although academic <lb/>achievement of migrant students falls behind that of their native counterparts in many countries in <lb/>which migration policy does not favour skilled migration (OECD, 2007a: 175), overall, there is a <lb/>positive association between migrant status and ambitious occupational plans. This finding is <lb/>noteworthy as it poses interesting questions for policy makers. While migrant students in many <lb/>countries perform at a lower level, they are optimistic and hold high expectations with regard to their <lb/>future occupational achievement. Where their socio-economic background is often significantly lower <lb/>than the mainstream average, they aspire as high as their native peers; where their socio-economic <lb/>background matches that of their native peers, they expect more of themselves. The challenge for <lb/>educational policymaking is to effectively convert these high levels of ambition into more academic <lb/>success. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

In Norway, a study of high school students <lb/>demonstrated that female students tended to prefer career types associated with higher levels of <lb/>intrinsic rewards (Huang 2009). Recent studies in economic psychology report that women can be less <lb/>keen on competition and thus opt for careers which they perceive as driven less by competition and <lb/></body>

			<body>more by social co-operation and care (Humlum, Kleinjans, and Nielsen, 2010). All of these <lb/>explanations are consistent with the logic of the cultural gender essentialism thesis proposed by <lb/>Charles and Grusky (2004), except that these studies focus on micro-social or psychological <lb/>manifestations of what can be seen as a global institutional culture which shapes adolescent identities <lb/>and the social constructions of femininity and masculinity. In line with its predictions, studies in the <lb/>USA found that girls in high school who enrol in maths and science classes of highest difficulty see <lb/>themselves as &quot;less feminine, attractive, popular and sociable&quot; (Matyas and Dix 1992; Xie and <lb/>Shauman 2003: 48). Thus if imageries associated with certain professions seem to be in profound <lb/>opposition to the cultural norms of femininity or masculinity, the choice of a career incompatible with <lb/>such norms must come at a high cost, despite the promise of potential material or non-material <lb/>rewards. <lb/>108. <lb/>The analysis in this section focuses on indicators of students&apos; self-efficacy and self-concept <lb/>to explore the possibility that girls have lower levels of self-confidence in their science performance <lb/>and thus are less likely to seek more demanding careers. Both science self-efficacy and self-concept <lb/>are the potential causes of gender differences according to the argument which posits that girls, <lb/>despite their equally good performance in science, lag behind boys in self-confidence and thus see <lb/>little point in investing effort and time in their science skills. Prior analyses of science self-concept, <lb/>showed that boys in most PISA 2006 participating countries had higher levels of belief in their own <lb/>abilities than girls (OECD, 2007a: Table 3.21). In some countries the differences were substantial. <lb/>109. <lb/>The first measure, science self-efficacy, probed students&apos; perceptions that they could easily <lb/>&quot;Recognise the science question that underlies a newspaper report on a health issue&quot;; &quot;Explain why <lb/>earthquakes occur more frequently in some areas than in others&quot;; &quot;Describe the role of antibiotics in <lb/>the treatment of disease&quot;; &quot;Identify the science question associated with the disposal of garbage&quot;; <lb/>&quot;Predict how changes to an environment will affect the survival of certain species&quot;; &quot;Interpret the <lb/>scientific information provided on the labelling of food items &quot;; &quot;Discuss how new evidence can lead <lb/>you to change your understanding about the possibility of life on Mars&quot; and &quot;Identify the better of two <lb/>explanations for the formation of acid rain&quot; (OECD, 2007a: 134; OECD, 2007b: 323) <lb/>110. <lb/>The second measure, science self-concept, comprised students&apos; self-evaluation in response to <lb/>the following items : &quot;Learning advanced science topics would be easy for me&quot;, &quot;I can usually give <lb/>good answers to test questions on school science topics &quot;, &quot;I learn science topics quickly&quot;, &quot;Science <lb/>topics are easy for me&quot;, &quot;When I am being taught science I can understand the concepts very well&quot; <lb/>and &quot;I can easily understand new ideas in science&quot; (OECD, 2007b: 323). <lb/>111. <lb/>Overall, as evident in Tables 6a and 6b, science self-concept is a better predictor of <lb/>expectations to work either in engineering or in health than science self-efficiency. <lb/>112. <lb/>While, in many countries, coefficients for self-efficacy are not significantly different from <lb/>zero, the belief in one&apos;s own ability is positively associated with an expectation to work in engineering <lb/>or computing in many countries. There are exceptions to this pattern as neither attitudinal variable <lb/>contributes any explanatory power in Switzerland, the USA, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Portugal, <lb/>Mexico, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria or Estonia, as far as engineering is concerned. In some contrast to <lb/>this trend, the positive association between science-related self-confidence and a plan to enter health <lb/>sector employment holds in all OECD countries, without a single exception. <lb/>113. <lb/>While the discussion of these patterns is informative in its own right, the key goal of the <lb/>analyses in this section is to explore factors which might be capable of bridging the gender gap. <lb/>Attitudinal variables, which relate to self-confidence and self-efficacy, while most relevant to <lb/>occupational expectations, make no contribution to the explanation of the gender differences in <lb/>preferences for these particular career fields. In other words, while boys and girls differ in their <lb/>confidence levels with respect to science performance, this difference cannot account for the <lb/>horizontal segregation of their occupational plans within the broad field of science. <lb/></body>

			<body>114. <lb/>Gender coefficients in Model 1 and Model 2 change very little. Thus, although boys feel far <lb/>more comfortable about their science ability in many countries within and outside of OECD (OECD, <lb/>2007a: Table 3.21), the gender difference in confidence levels cannot be seen as a key to <lb/>understanding why students of each gender strongly prefer their own particular niche of science <lb/>employment. When the difference in science self-efficacy and self-concepts between students is taken <lb/>into account, the gender gap remains as it was in the baseline estimation. All of the factors so far <lb/>considered foster a stronger likelihood of considering a science-related employment. But these <lb/>contributions are above and beyond the systematic gender divide, which is ubiquitous in almost all <lb/>countries, with only some variation in size. <lb/>115. <lb/>PISA 2006 included a series of questions designed to collect information about students&apos; <lb/>perceived career preparation and career information levels. <lb/>116. <lb/>The first group of questions, combined into a scale, comprised four items which probed <lb/>students&apos; perception of being well prepared by their school for a possibility of pursuing a career in <lb/>science (CARPREP) (OECD, 2007b: 331). Students were asked whether their schools gave them the <lb/>basic skills for future science employment, whether science subjects offered at school were well <lb/>suited to the preparation for a broad range of such careers. Moreover, students were also asked <lb/>whether science classes they were enrolled in served well the purpose of science career preparation <lb/>and whether teachers were effective in imbuing students with relevant skills. The following <lb/>statements constituted the scale: &quot;The subjects available at my school provide students with the basic <lb/>skills and knowledge for a science-related career&quot;; &quot;The school science subjects at my school provide <lb/>students with the basic skills and knowledge for many different careers&quot;; &quot;The subjects I study <lb/>provide me with the basic skills and knowledge for a science-related career&quot;; &quot; My teachers equip me <lb/>with the basic skills and knowledge I need for a science-related career&quot; (OECD, 2007a: 331). <lb/>117. <lb/>Students participating in PISA 2006 have been also asked whether they felt well informed <lb/>about &quot;Science-related careers that are available in the job market&quot;; &quot;Where to find information about <lb/>science-related careers&quot;; &quot;The steps a student needs to take if they want a science-related career&quot; and <lb/>&quot;Employers or companies that hire people to work in science-related careers&quot; . A multi-item scale <lb/>CARINFO was constructed from these items (OECD, 2007a: 331). <lb/>118. <lb/>If levels of information and the feeling of being well prepared for a science-related career <lb/>differ systematically between genders, such differences might be conducive to the variation in <lb/>readiness to plan a science-related career. However, as evident in Table 7a, while these factors are <lb/>related to higher probability of planning employment in engineering or health in many countries, they <lb/>do not explain the persisting gender difference in preferences for these subfields of science. <lb/>119. <lb/>The perceptions of oneself as well prepared and informed about the prospects of a science <lb/>career are positively associated with the plan to work in health in many countries, while the <lb/>associations between such perceptions and the plan to pursue engineering are less frequent. Only in <lb/>the UK, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands do both perceptions foster a higher likelihood of <lb/>planning a computing or engineering career. In Poland, Hungary, Finland and Lithuania there is even <lb/>a negative association between the sense of being either well informed or well prepared for a science <lb/>job and the plan to pursue an occupation in engineering and computing. In contrast, plans for careers <lb/>in health are mostly positively associated with higher levels of self-assessed career information and <lb/>preparation. These differential patterns point to the possibility that, in many countries, a number of <lb/>pro-engineering choices is made by adolescents in the context of little information about the nature <lb/>and requirements of these jobs. Therefore, it is possible that more comprehensive information <lb/>programs, focused on these particular occupations, could increase the number of students who <lb/>develop an interest in them. Conversely, where such programs already exist, the lack of association <lb/>between high information levels and the intention to work in these occupations is consistent with the <lb/>assumption that preferring or shunning engineering is driven primarily by the deeply entrenched <lb/>gender ideologies which construe some occupations as more appropriate than others for particular <lb/>sexes (Howel et al, 2005).

In many countries, high <lb/>achievers, migrant students, students who consider themselves better informed about science-related <lb/>employment options are all more likely to plan to work in science. Yet, for any two students who <lb/>differ only with respect to gender and are otherwise identical, a female student is far more likely to <lb/>opt for health science than engineering. A male student will make the opposite choice. This tendency <lb/>is unexplained by any of the individual level characteristics canvassed in the preceding sections. <lb/>School level factors <lb/>121. <lb/>Prior studies of gender typed adolescent career plans found a number of school <lb/>characteristics which boost higher status expectations among students. These characteristics are <lb/>school resources, the compositional features of school populations and particular processes which <lb/>manifest in the formal and informal culture of school. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>122. <lb/>For instance schools in urban areas, which cater to the children of well-educated managers <lb/>or professionals, have students with higher ambition levels. There, student occupational ambition <lb/>exceeds levels implied by particular family backgrounds. Well-resourced schools with high level of <lb/>access to information technology, private schools, schools which are selective, that is refuse <lb/>admission to the less academically successful students foster very high occupational ambition among <lb/>their pupils (Marks, 2010; Sikora and Saha, 2009). Selective and affluent school environments convey <lb/>the &quot;affluent community&quot; boost to students&apos; plans and expectations. A student from a modest social <lb/>background is thus likely to expect more educational and occupational success as such expectations <lb/>are normalised in the school&apos;s cultural environment. <lb/>123. <lb/>Yet, while all of these factors have a positive relationship with the intentions to enter high <lb/>status employment, almost none of these factors have any predictive power with respect to intentions <lb/>to work in engineering as opposed to the health sector. <lb/>124. <lb/>The country specific two level logit models which introduce school characteristics as control <lb/>variables in are provided in Tables 8a and 8b below. Only percentage of girls in school and the <lb/>averaged socio-economic status are reported, although the models controlled also for the teacher to <lb/>student ratio, an indicator of whether a school employed a counsellor on regular basis, an scale <lb/>measuring the school activities aimed at promoting science (SCIPROM) and the principal&apos;s perception <lb/>that teachers in the school concentrated on developing in students the skills and knowledge essential <lb/>for science careers. Other control variables contributed a negligible increase to the models&apos; <lb/>explanatory power and therefore are not presented here. <lb/>125. <lb/>To allow for the variation in the effect these variables might have on students&apos; plans the <lb/>analyses were conducted separately by gender. In most countries these school characteristics have no <lb/>consequences for occupational plans oriented towards specific subfields of science. <lb/>126. <lb/>However, as Table 8a illustrates, in several countries there is evidence that boys attending <lb/>schools with large proportions of females in student populations are less likely to go along with their <lb/>own sex&apos;s preferences for engineering and computing. While girls attending schools dominated by <lb/>their own gender are even more reluctant to contemplate these fields of employment, the effect for <lb/>boys, instead of being no different from zero, is, where significant, in the same direction as the effect <lb/>for girls. This is the case in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Slovak Republic and <lb/>Slovenia. In several countries the attendance of school with higher proportions of girls may temper <lb/>boys plans even if it has no extra influence on girls. This is the case in Chile, Hungary, Ireland, Korea, <lb/>Portugal, Turkey and the USA. <lb/></body>

			<body>127. <lb/>These effects could be interpreted as support for cultural explanations of gender typing if the <lb/>numbers of girls can be seen as a proxy for cultural factors in operation in particular schools. <lb/>However, these effects can be only tentative evidence, as there are many countries in which the <lb/>proportion of girls within a school is irrelevant to students&apos; occupational intentions related to <lb/>engineering. The effects of school populations&apos; average SES, where consequential, indicate that <lb/>engineering can be popular in schools with lower and higher SES profiles. <lb/>128. <lb/>In some analogy to the patterns emergent in the analysis of school composition effects and <lb/>engineering, in several countries boys who attend schools with high representation of girls are more <lb/>likely, above and beyond their individual inclination, to consider health services as their future career <lb/>(Table 8b). However, this is not the case in all countries where this factor is relevant. Attending a <lb/>school with a large population of girls deters boys from this line of employment in Australia and <lb/>Bulgaria. In many places gender school composition is irrelevant and the effects of school <lb/>population&apos;s SES are highly variable from country to country. <lb/>129. <lb/>Overall, the aspects of school environments examined here seem of limited relevance to the <lb/>gender differences in preferences for particular subfields of science. It is possible that more detailed <lb/>indicators of gender cultures within schools could reveal the processes which in some schools help <lb/>bridge and in others perpetuate the horizontal gender segregation of occupational intentions. The <lb/>evidence available in PISA 2006 indicates that, in at least several countries, the gender compositional <lb/>effect points to the future promise of such investigations. However, until more direct measures of <lb/>gender role attitudes and cultures within schools are available for many countries, no more insights <lb/>about the impact of gender ideologies on these outcomes are possible. <lb/></body>

			<body>Characteristics of national education systems and labour markets <lb/>130. <lb/>Country characteristics which have been demonstrated to foster more ambitious career <lb/>expectations among youth comprise several factors in a specific configuration (Sikora and Saha, <lb/>2010). Students in less prosperous countries where participation rates in secondary education are <lb/>lower, where the levels of economic disparities are substantial but where employment opportunities <lb/>within the service sector expand rapidly, cherish strong and unanimous hopes for high status <lb/>employment. This tendency is enhanced by the absence of early sorting into academic and vocational <lb/>streams at the age of 15 as well as the reception of direct financial aid from abroad by the national <lb/>education sector (Sikora and Saha, 2010). <lb/>131. <lb/>Official aid, administered by the United Nations and the associated international agencies, is <lb/>usually tied to various forms of educational expansion programs which are built around the global <lb/>ideology of meritocracy and egalitarianism in education. Obviously aid is directed to developing <lb/>countries, but receiving aid to education is a strong predictor of students&apos; higher occupational <lb/>ambitions also when differences in economic wealth and inequality between countries are taken into <lb/>account (Sikora and Saha, 2010). Thus high school students in countries which experience poverty <lb/>and inequality are motivated not only by relative deprivation coupled with the fast pace of expansion <lb/>in national labour markets but also the promises of the meritocratic and egalitarian ideologies <lb/>advanced by international aid and co-operation. <lb/>132. <lb/>In contrast to the average status of expected occupations, the tendency of female and male <lb/>students to opt for a career in one of the subfields of science considered here is not systematically <lb/>aligned with many country characteristics, be they economic or related to the features of national <lb/>education systems. The Gender Gap Index which measures the degree to which countries provide <lb/>equal access for men and women to economic, educational and political resources, regardless of the <lb/>level of economic development appears to have a negative relationship with all dependent variables in <lb/>Table 9 (Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi, 2006). The GGI effect is statistically significant only as a <lb/>predictor of boys&apos; propensity to plan a health-related career. However, the negative coefficients seem <lb/>to suggest that in more gender egalitarian societies the propensity of both genders to plan a career in <lb/>engineering/computing or health is weaker than in nations with higher levels of gender inequality. <lb/>Early tracking of students into a larger number of programs or types of schools lowers the likelihood <lb/>of planning a career in health among boys and girls and in engineering among girls only. The former <lb/>is likely to be associated with the incompatibility of early vocational streaming and school pathways <lb/>which lead to medicine and other health-related employment. The latter suggests that early streaming <lb/>into vocational tracks may deter girls but not boys from considering engineering/computing as future <lb/>area of employment. <lb/>133. <lb/>Finally higher levels of economic development are associated with lower likelihood for <lb/>girls of planning employment in engineering while boys in more affluent countries are less likely than <lb/>boys elsewhere to expect a health related career. While the segregation literature (Charles and <lb/>Bradley, 2009: 945) suggests that girls in more developed countries are overrepresented in health-<lb/>related university degrees, the GDP coefficient for girls&apos; expectations of health employment is not <lb/>different from zero. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/>51 <lb/>Table 9.

			<body>SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS <lb/>Main findings <lb/>134. <lb/>This comprehensive examination of the patterns in the vertical and horizontal segregation in <lb/>youth career plans reveals that occupational expectations of 15 year olds are segregated by gender in a <lb/>manner resembling gender segregation in university enrolments and in the labour market. The broad <lb/>picture is that girls expect to work in higher status jobs than boys. Moreover, science is as popular among <lb/>girls as it is among boys in many countries. But a closer examination of science-related employment, <lb/>discloses each gender&apos;s strong preference for its own niche of science, namely, health versus engineering <lb/>and computing. While this form of horizontal segregation in adolescent plans was previously documented <lb/>in a number of single-country studies, this paper demonstrates for the first time that this type of segregation <lb/>is prevalent in a many countries that differ markedly in their educational systems and socio-economic <lb/>conditions. The omnipresence of this pattern defies the country-specific explanations and calls for the <lb/>consideration of global cultural ideologies as the framework for understanding the persisting segregation of <lb/>students&apos; occupational expectations first documented in the 1960s and 1970s (Holland 1997; Marini and <lb/>Greenberger 1978). The cultural theory of gender essentialism which asserts the persisting association <lb/>between culturally construed gender identity and particular types of jobs aligns with the patterns found in <lb/>this analysis. Because the construction of gender identity models is cultural rather than biological, <lb/>historical changes to the entrenched associations between gender and particular types of employment are <lb/>certainly possible. <lb/>135. <lb/>The cultural processes of socialisation which distribute the young people into different niches of <lb/>national labour markets associate students&apos; occupational expectations with different fields of employment <lb/>by Year 9 of high school. The analytical strategy of examining a large number of potential reasons why <lb/>these preferences are so firmly segregated so early leads to an unequivocal conclusion. Neither the gender <lb/>gap in the preferences for engineering and computing nor for health sciences can be explained by the broad <lb/>range of high school experiences. The differences between genders in academic performance, family <lb/>social, economic and cultural resources, students&apos; migration status, vocational program and ISCED level <lb/>placement, career information and preparation as well as self-confidence in science ability might exist but <lb/>they do not bridge or widen gender disparities in preferences for particular types of science employment. <lb/>At 15 years of age students&apos; career goals, if present, are already strongly gender typed and this gender <lb/>difference seems largely unrelated to the varying levels of academic performance or self-confidence <lb/>although systematic differences between sexes in performance and confidence are evident in many <lb/>countries. <lb/>Policy implications <lb/>136. <lb/>The starting point in any attempt to develop policy guidelines emerging from this research must <lb/>involve a decision whether this type of horizontal segregation is a social problem. Is there an identifiable <lb/>talent loss at the individual and societal levels which can be attributed to the concentration of women and <lb/>men into different fields of employment? Arguably such talent loss may be considerable as the creative <lb/>activity of engineers and computing scientists is likely to benefit from gender diverse insights. For instance <lb/>anecdotal evidence indicates that an absence of women from engineering teams designing new products <lb/>and technical solutions results in ignorance of gender-specific user needs and thus in potentially sub-<lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>optimal designs. Moreover, the underrepresentation of men in healthcare and other care-based occupations <lb/>is likely to adversely affect the progressively greying societies in which care industries expand while <lb/>struggling to attract a diverse pool of workers. <lb/>137. <lb/>There is much scope for a more comprehensive provision of educational programs which not <lb/>only popularise engineering and computing amongst girls, but also aim to raise the level of interest in care <lb/>and healthcare among boys. However, the important caveat is that such programs cannot be conceived as <lb/>isolated, locally implemented initiatives. They must coexist with a host of &quot;social, cultural and economic <lb/>changes that are large scale and are interdependent&quot; (Xie and Shauman 2003: 214). As Xie and Shauman <lb/>point out, isolated policy programs are unlikely to be effective in implementing and consolidating such <lb/>broad changes in the institutional and cultural contexts in which women make their career choices. Rather <lb/>the universal nature of these horizontal divides calls for initiatives from international agencies supporting <lb/>educational policy at country level. Moreover, they must be implemented at much earlier stages of <lb/>students&apos; educational experiences and with support of parents, as the influence of the latter on their <lb/>children&apos;s vocational intentions is non-trivial. <lb/>138. <lb/>The entrenched cultural climates of gender essentialism cannot be attributed to a single process or <lb/>failure within the educational institutions. These differences in youth expectations are most unlikely to be <lb/>primarily reinforced by lack of educators&apos; efforts to achieve gender integration in school environments <lb/>(Howel et al. 2005). Rather, these divides are most likely too firmly established by the time students reach <lb/>their 15th birthday to be easily mediated by simple educational policy or vocational counselling measures. <lb/>139. <lb/>Nevertheless, cross-national differentiation in the perceived desirability of engineering and <lb/>computing raises questions about the effectiveness of vocational counselling services within the education <lb/>systems of particular countries. Gender ideologies are undeniably cultural phenomena and their <lb/>entrenchment in institutional settings, media discourses and everyday life creates a context in which even <lb/>the best designed counselling programs, while not without chances for success, are likely to encounter <lb/>difficulties. The relative shortage of prominent role models, that is &quot;female celebrities&quot; in engineering and <lb/>computing, the well-publicised underrepresentation of women in these fields, their reputed family <lb/>&quot;unfriendliness&quot; and adolescents&apos; day-to-day experiences often defy the encouragement girls receive from <lb/>the educators and policy makers. <lb/>140. <lb/>The difficulties facing future policy initiatives designed to bridge the disparities between young <lb/>men&apos;s and women&apos;s occupational choices lay in the complex network of micro-social processes which <lb/>reproduce these gender-specific patterns. While various information campaigns within and outside schools <lb/>are launched to entice young women into traditionally masculine fields of employment and, less <lb/>frequently, to encourage men to enter feminised professions, they appear to be no more than &quot;surface <lb/>veneer&quot; egalitarianism (Charles and Grusky, 2004). The messages from the policy makers often do not <lb/>correspond to the messages transmitted by the media, the actual gendered patterns of employment known <lb/>to youth from their every-day observations and the ideology of cultural gender essentialism which <lb/>constructs women as better suited to occupations related to nurturance, care and managing interpersonal <lb/>relationships. In contrast to the educational campaigns which encourage girls to take up computing and <lb/>engineering, the programs designed to direct boys towards nursing or midwifery or teaching are few or <lb/>non-existent so the efforts towards employment desegregation can be seen so far as partial at best. This is <lb/>attributable to the popularity of &quot;separate but equal&quot; ideology, which sees genders as necessarily belonging <lb/>in different niches of the labour market (Charles and Bradley, 2009). In this approach, the goal of policy is <lb/>solely to be concerned about the vertical segregation by gender in educational and occupational <lb/>expectations and attainments. However, even if monetary returns and status of segregated careers were <lb/>equivalent, crowding men and women into different fields of employment can be associated with a number <lb/>of social disadvantages. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>141. <lb/>Despite the difficulties in designing and implementing policies aimed at gender integration in all <lb/>fields of education and employment, the inroads that women have made into various areas of science, <lb/>including engineering, over the last four decades are promising. Yet, the focus of policy must widen to <lb/>include the measures to entice adolescent men to enter non-traditional areas of employment. While several <lb/>isolated policy programs are unlikely to bring gender segregation in its vertical and horizontal forms to an <lb/>end, the more broadly conceived policy programs, supported by the international agencies, have the <lb/>potential to bring about change. The change at the level of students&apos; individual choices, through early <lb/>broadening of perceptive horizons, might not be possible, however, without some institutionally enforced <lb/>employment and educational gender equity incentives that specifically address horizontal segregation by <lb/>gender. <lb/>142. <lb/>Adolescent occupational expectations align closely with patterns in graduation rates across <lb/>tertiary institutions. Among science graduates women have made strides in agriculture, health and biology <lb/>but not other areas. While the difficulties with combining the demanding science careers and family life are <lb/>likely to be important deterrents, the fact that across the world girls at 15 show a remarkable unity of <lb/>opinions in preferring health science to other types of science is consequential. It reveals cultural forces <lb/>reinforced by a conglomerate of social micro processes and structures of opportunities. <lb/>143. <lb/>The reverse side of these trends is that boys need enticement to enter health and teaching-related <lb/>occupations in greater numbers. The severe underrepresentation of women amongst physicists, <lb/>mathematicians, engineers and computer scientists is undesirable but so is having only token numbers of <lb/>men in socio-cultural, health, and care-related professions. Cultural constructs which frame particular types <lb/>of employment as &quot;feminine&quot; or &quot;masculine&quot; limit the full realisation of individual talent. This process <lb/>begins early, is cumulatively reinforced over the life course of young people and universally present. Thus <lb/>its amelioration requires a mobilisation of policy which will lead to the shift in values, perceptions, <lb/>institutional incentives and labour market opportunities. Such a mobilisation seems possible only through <lb/>the co-ordination of cross-national policy efforts. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<body>Appendix 3: Plans to enter socio-cultural professions <lb/>To complement the descriptive presentation of gender differences in the preferred fields of <lb/>employment Appendix 3 summarises the information about students who saw their future in education, <lb/>law, arts and social sciences. While the cursory overview of occupational titles listed most frequently by <lb/>PISA respondents suggested that teaching was likely to appeal to both young men and women, the <lb/>proportions of young women who choose teaching, and other socio-cultural professions (the full list of <lb/>which is in Appendix 2 Section D) outweigh the numbers of young men by a large margin. <lb/>Japan is the only country where socio-cultural professions attract more boys than girls, but it is also <lb/>the only country where the information about students&apos; plans was coded only to two, instead of four digit <lb/>level of ISCO88. Thus this exception must treated with caution. In all other countries employment in these <lb/>fields attracts more girls than boys. The disparities between countries in the size of the gender gap are not <lb/>as strongly pronounced as in the case of health and computing/engineering employment. Nevertheless at <lb/>least twice as many girls as boys plan a socio-cultural career in Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Austria, Greece, <lb/>Spain, Luxembourg, Finland and the Czech Republic in the OECD group. At least as large a gender gap in <lb/>these preferences exists in Macao-China, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, <lb/>Croatia, Russian Federation and Jordan. <lb/>These patterns are consistent with the proposition that gender ideologies entrenched in educational <lb/>institutions, labour markets and the popular culture are powerful forces operating, at least to some extent, <lb/>in much varied economic, political and social conditions in a notably similar manner. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Appendix 4: Missing data <lb/>The single question about student career plans is subject to high levels of missing data in some <lb/>countries and therefore the impact of missing information must be systematically considered. <lb/>While the construction of student achievement scores and most attitudinal indices in the PISA data <lb/>results in reduction of missing data, in some nations the proportions of uncodable responses and missing <lb/>data on occupational expectations are high. The survey question about career plans is difficult to answer <lb/>for some students (see Appendix Table 7). Missing and uncodable responses range from 8 to 53%. In <lb/>almost all countries girls and students who are more successful academically are more likely to respond to <lb/>the question about occupational expectations. In contrast male students and those less academically <lb/>successful tend to skip this question. <lb/>Firstly, it is possible that students considered this particular question to be a &quot; test &quot; question, and thus <lb/>the more academically oriented students felt a stronger obligation to give a valid answer. Thus the fact that <lb/>the background questionnaire is administered in the context of a school test might adversely affect these <lb/>students for whom the test situation is particularly confronting. For example, students completing an <lb/>academic-oriented questionnaire where there are &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong &quot; answers, might be inclined to regard <lb/>the educational and occupational expectation questions to have &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong &quot; answers. <lb/>Gender differences in levels of missing data are substantial and in almost all countries girls are more <lb/>likely to provide information about their future career plans. It is possible, as was argued in the context of <lb/>other studies, that girls tend to form concrete plans regarding their future at earlier stages in high school <lb/>than boys (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005). Therefore girls are more likely to give some answer to questions <lb/>regarding plans for the future while boys are more likely to find such questions difficult to answer and <lb/>annoying (White 2007). Moreover, in some countries, the average academic performance of girls exceeds, <lb/>if by a small margin, the average performance of boys which may widen the gap in the likelihood of <lb/>engaging with this question. <lb/>The gender difference in the rates of missing answers may be reflecting higher levels of average <lb/>compliance with the school culture among girls. Schools usually encourage developing educational and <lb/>occupational ambition as part of vocational counselling and a part of the broader education process. This <lb/>compliance can be facilitated by the fact that women tend to be concentrated in non-manual employment <lb/>sectors and thus the list of careers known to be entered by women which are attractive in terms of social <lb/>status is both shorter and possibly better known among adolescents. <lb/>At least in Australia the ability and readiness to answer the question about career expectations has <lb/>been found to be a good predictor of young adults&apos; success in the labour market (Sikora and Saha, 2011). <lb/>Relative to their high school peers who found this question too difficult to answer, young Australians who <lb/>had a concrete occupational goal in high school tended to begin their adult career in higher status positions. <lb/>This was the case even after the differences in academic performance in high school, university completion <lb/>and plans regarding education have been taken into account. <lb/>Because the focus of this paper is on gender differences in the expectations of science-related <lb/>employment, it is possible to assess the differences between students who answered and did not answer the <lb/>question about their expected occupation using a closely related multi-item scale on science-related future <lb/>(SCIEFUT)(OECD, 2007b: 16). This scale is useful for this purpose as it incorporates the following <lb/>statement &quot;I would like to work in a career involving science&quot; alongside three similar items. The scale has <lb/>low levels of missing data (from 0.1% in Korea to 10% in Israel) and the analysis of its mean values, <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/>77 <lb/>presented below, reveals that, in many countries, there are few differences in future science career <lb/>orientation for students who did and did not provide their expected occupation. In the eleven countries <lb/>where such differences exist in girls&apos; plans, and in seventeen countries in which boys&apos; plans differ between <lb/>the two groups, the differences are small (Appendix 4 Tables 1a and 1b). They do not exceed 20% of a <lb/>standard deviation on a measurement scale ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 standard deviations. The scale <lb/>measurement units have been standardised within the OECD countries. <lb/>Appendix 4 Table 1a <lb/>Missing data by mean values on future-oriented science motivation.

			<body>Appendix 5: Additional information on methods <lb/>This appendix provides the details of the modelling strategy used for three level models with binary <lb/>variables and multi-level models with continuous outcomes. <lb/>For outcomes which were binary variables the three level model specified the probability of <lb/>expecting an occupation within a specified subfield of science ( ) <lb/>ijc <lb/>π of person i from school j and country <lb/>c using log of the odds: <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>log <lb/>/ (1 <lb/>) logit( ) <lb/>ijc <lb/>ijc <lb/>ijc <lb/>π <lb/>π <lb/>π <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>Continuous outcomes -two-level models <lb/>Where the dependent variable was continuous (e.g. the ISEI scale of occupational status) the two-<lb/>level models took on the following form: <lb/>Student level (1): <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>ij <lb/>j <lb/>n n <lb/>ij <lb/>n <lb/>Y <lb/>X r <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ <lb/>School level (2): <lb/>0 <lb/>0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>j <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>j <lb/>n <lb/>X <lb/>u <lb/>β γ <lb/>γ <lb/>= <lb/>= + <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ <lb/>where β 0j is the constant or the intercept in school j and 00 <lb/>γ is the average intercept across schools in <lb/>each country. The error component u 0j varies between schools within each country, Β n=1 through β N are <lb/>regression coefficients for corresponding student-level explanatory variables X n=1 through X N. Moreover, r ij, <lb/>which is error varying between students within a school, is also specified. In multilevel logit models, this <lb/>individual error term is omitted due to identification problems (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002). <lb/>Binary outcomes -three-level models <lb/>For the three-level estimation with country-level covariates the models had the following form: <lb/>Student level (1): <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>logit( ) <lb/>N <lb/>ij <lb/>jc <lb/>n n <lb/>n <lb/>X <lb/>π <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>+ ∑ <lb/>School level (2): <lb/>0 <lb/>0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>jc <lb/>c <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>jc <lb/>n <lb/>X <lb/>u <lb/>β <lb/>γ <lb/>γ <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ <lb/>Country level (3): <lb/>00 <lb/>000 <lb/>00 <lb/>00 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>c <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>c <lb/>n <lb/>X <lb/>h <lb/>γ <lb/>η <lb/>η <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ <lb/>Country level estimates are in the third equation and subscript c denotes regression coefficients at this <lb/>level. Country-level covariates (X 00n=1 through X 00N ) correspond to regression coefficients (X 00n=1 through <lb/>X 00N ) while 000 <lb/>η denotes the average intercept across countries. The error component 0c <lb/>h varies between <lb/>countries. <lb/>All estimates have been obtained with robust standard errors which is appropriate to offset the impact <lb/>of any non-normality of outcomes and non-independence of observations due to a two-stage stratified <lb/>cluster sample design. In three level models the sampling weights as per Pfeffermann et al. procedure were <lb/>used (Pfeffermann, Skinner, Holmes, Goldstein, and Rasbash 2002). To ensure that each country <lb/>contributes equally to the analysis the student final weights were also normalised at the country level. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2011)3 <lb/>81 <lb/>THE OECD EDUCATION WORKING PAPERS SERIES ON LINE <lb/>The OECD Education Working Papers Series may be found at: <lb/>• The OECD Directorate for Education website: www.oecd.org/edu/workingpapers<lb/>• The OECD&apos;s online library, SourceOECD: www.sourceoecd.org<lb/>• The Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) website: www.repec.org<lb/>If you wish to be informed about the release of new OECD Education working papers, please: <lb/>• Go to www.oecd.org<lb/>• Click on &quot; My OECD &quot;<lb/>• Sign up and create an account with &quot; My OECD &quot;<lb/>• Select &quot; Education &quot; as one of your favourite themes<lb/>• Choose &quot; OECD Education Working Papers &quot; as one of the newsletters you would like to receive</body>
