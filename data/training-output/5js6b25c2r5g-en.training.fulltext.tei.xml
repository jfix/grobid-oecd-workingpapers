			<p>Embracing green growth can secure strong, stable and sustainable development. Green growth recognises<lb/> and integrates the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning,<lb/> which is critical to avoid natural capital depletion, the worst of climate change and social and national<lb/> security risks (OECD, 2013). This is particularly true for developing countries, because of their<lb/> dependence on natural assets and acute exposure and vulnerability to environmental risks, ranging from<lb/> air, water and soil pollution, as well as natural resource scarcity and extreme weather events exacerbated<lb/> by climate change. A green growth policy framework recognises and aims to address both micro-and<lb/> macro-level pressures that countries face to grow their economies, while also managing environmental<lb/> risks. In poorer developing countries, micro-level pressures may include lack of access to basic services<lb/> such as shelter, fuel, water; while macro-level pressures are threats to stable livelihoods due to<lb/> unemployment, poverty, social inequality, or resource scarcity or mismanagement. Leaders in developing<lb/> countries today face clear choices to guide development towards a new growth model (OECD, 2013).<lb/> These countries have the opportunity to move away from conventional growth strategies – the &quot; grow now,<lb/> clean up later &quot; model – towards a green growth model, with the aim to build resilient and fairer economies<lb/> around a vision of sustainable development.<lb/></p>

			<p>An increasing number of developing countries have formulated and/or implemented innovative policies to<lb/> pursue green growth, notably in Africa (<ref type="biblio">AfDB, 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013, 2014a</ref>).<lb/> Zambia, in particular, is committed to drawing up an Inclusive Green Growth Strategy (IGGS) that builds<lb/> upon a nationally-defined and comprehensive definition of green growth (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2012</ref>).<lb/> A preliminary understanding already exists on what green growth means in Zambia, namely inclusive<lb/> development that makes sustainable and equitable use of the country&apos;s natural resources within ecological<lb/> limits (<ref type="biblio">Banda and Bass, 2014</ref>). This effort can draw from a solid set of initiatives and institutions where<lb/> green considerations are already beginning to be mainstreamed. Key among these are Zambia&apos;s National<lb/> Long Term Vision and the Fifth and Sixth National Development Plans (2006-10 and 2011-15<lb/> respectively), and subsequent implementation through green programmes, policies, and processes i.e.<lb/> targeting biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other<lb/> environmental objectives.<lb/> This paper illustrates the foundations of green growth in Zambia and provides an overview of bilateral<lb/> green development co-operation efforts in the country from 2004 to 2012. Zambia is considered a<lb/> &quot; frontrunner &quot; with respect to green planning and policy (<ref type="biblio">Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014</ref>), yet most of<lb/> the funding for its green programmes and initiatives has come from providers of development co-operation<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Aongola et al., 2009</ref>; Government of Zambia, 2011a). Bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA)<lb/> targeting green objectives reached up to 30% of total bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 218<lb/> million) (OECD DAC CRS, 2014). 1 Importantly, the volume of green bilateral commitments increased<lb/> steadily since 2004-06 (albeit part of this increase resulted from better reporting of green ODA flows by<lb/> members of the OECD&apos;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC)), but this happened in the context of<lb/> falling ODA flows to Zambia – bilateral ODA fell from USD 1.7 billion in 2004-06 to USD 738 million in<lb/> 2010-12. 2 This illustrates the important role of green ODA in Zambia.<lb/></table>

			<p>Green ODA to Zambia targets many of the leading sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, energy,<lb/> transport, and water supply and sanitation, and these are identified as key by the country&apos;s vision and plans<lb/> for its development pathway (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2006a, 2006b, 2011a</ref>). This suggests that green<lb/> interventions are relatively aligned with the government of Zambia&apos;s plans and that providers use these to<lb/> inform the priority sectors and types of technical support provided (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ I,<lb/> 2007 and Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). The Joint Assistance Strategy to Zambia (JASZ) has<lb/> been a key mechanism to co-ordinate across development co-operation activities of different providers.<lb/> With respect to green interventions, the JASZ has avoided duplication of provider activities, and has<lb/> improved the information flow between providers and the government of Zambia (Ministry of Foreign<lb/> Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Working closely with the government, several Nordic countries, which rank<lb/> among the most active providers of green ODA in Zambia and lead under the JASZ on green matters, have<lb/> established strategic plans in co-operation with the government to implement activities that support<lb/> mainstreaming green objectives into many areas of government operations and policy (e.g. agriculture,<lb/> forestry, water supply and sanitation).<lb/></p>

			<p>The JASZ has potential to be the main forum for providers to support the implementation of any<lb/> forthcoming agenda on green growth led by the government of Zambia. To do so, and to further increase<lb/> the effectiveness of development co-operation in the Zambian context, the JASZ could continue aligning<lb/> the interests of providers and those of Zambia (<ref type="biblio">Mulenga, 2013</ref>) in three respects:<lb/></p>

			<p>• First, the government of Zambia targets poverty reduction as its chief priority in both<lb/> development planning and in its future inclusive green economy strategy (<ref type="biblio">Banda and Bass,<lb/> 2014</ref>). However, few green international projects have explicitly targeted or achieved the<lb/> objective of poverty reduction (<ref type="biblio">Banda, 2013</ref>). Although the main aim of ODA is, by definition, to<lb/> promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries, poverty reduction<lb/> remains an aspect of green ODA that could be bolstered.<lb/></p>

			<head>1<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper, bilateral ODA targeting green objectives refers to those activities targeting biodiversity, climate<lb/> change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other environmental objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/></head>

			<p>The DAC currently has 29 members: <ref type="biblio">Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, European<lb/> Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New<lb/> Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United</ref> Kingdom and<lb/> United States. This paper covers the activities of these providers, except from Czech Republic, Iceland, Poland,<lb/> Slovak Republic, and Slovenia, which joined in 2013. Korea joined the DAC in 2009.<lb/> • Second, a number of key sectors for the Zambian economy and its development receive virtually<lb/> no green ODA or relatively small volumes of green ODA and could benefit from increased<lb/> attention. These include key economic sectors, such as mining, industry or tourism (Telfer and<lb/> Sharpley, 2008; World Bank, 2014), which face a host of environment-related risks and are<lb/> important in Zambia&apos;s economic development (Government of Zambia, 2011a). Similarly, green<lb/> issues could also be further mainstreaming into local-level institutions and planning processes,<lb/> including in urban areas, where no projects could be identified targeting this level of governance<lb/> over 2010-12.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Finally, the Zambian government has identified the need for a climate financing framework (e.g.,<lb/> developing an in-country regulatory framework, human and institutional capacity and fiduciary<lb/> standards) to tap into international financing mechanisms and to use these funds to leverage<lb/> private sector investment into climate change (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2012</ref>). There is also an<lb/> opportunity to mobilise and allocate domestic resources – public and private – to some of the<lb/> core government functions to protect and promote environmental performance. Provider support<lb/> in this area could help with the government&apos;s objective to ease dependency on ODA and lessen<lb/> the reliance on foreign ODA in the green sector; while reducing the vulnerability of the country.<lb/></p>

			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>The African region has a comparatively low ecological footprint today (<ref type="biblio">Thornton et al., 2011</ref>). However,<lb/> Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with most of its crops likely to be negatively affected<lb/> by rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns (IPCC, 2014). These global changes interact with<lb/> local environmental issues such as land degradation, the depletion of natural resources, air and water<lb/> pollution. Development, urbanisation and population growth are also putting pressure on local<lb/> environments and increasing the ecological footprint of the region, while underlining the urgency of<lb/> strengthening the resilience of livelihoods and sustainably managing essential natural resources and related<lb/> ecosystem goods and services. This is particularly important in Africa, where the poorest of the poor rely<lb/> disproportionately on natural resources to sustain their livelihoods (OECD, 2013; IPCC, 2014) and where<lb/> it is becoming increasingly important to put green measures in place to manage and reduce the risks<lb/> associated with climate change and unsustainable development pathways (<ref type="biblio">AfDB, 2013</ref>)</p>

			<table>.<lb/> An increasing number of African countries have formulated or are formulating green growth strategies and<lb/> policies (AfDB; 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). Embracing green growth can secure a<lb/> strong, stable and sustainable future for developing countries because green growth rests on recognising<lb/> and integrating the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning<lb/> (OECD, 2013), thus helping to tackle pressing social issues (e.g. lack of access to basic services and<lb/> infrastructure, high vulnerability and threats to stable livelihoods from resource scarcity or<lb/> mismanagement).<lb/></table>

			<p>Realising the benefits of green growth, the Zambian government aims to develop an Inclusive Green<lb/> Growth Strategy (IGGS) (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2012</ref>). Although an official, comprehensive definition is<lb/> still to be developed, a preliminary understanding already exists on what green growth means in the<lb/> Zambian context, and which refers to inclusive development that makes sustainable and equitable use of<lb/> Zambia&apos;s natural resources within ecological limits (<ref type="biblio">Banda and Bass, 2014</ref>). Developing the IGGS could<lb/> build upon substantial experience with mainstreaming green considerations across sectors and levels of<lb/> government and pre-existing green institutions, processes and policies (<ref type="biblio">Banda, 2013; Banda and Bass,<lb/> 2014</ref>). These explain why Zambia is considered a &quot; frontrunner &quot; in the green planning and policy space in<lb/> Africa (<ref type="biblio">Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014</ref>). Notwithstanding this, most of Zambia&apos;s green activities have<lb/> been largely supported by international providers of development co-operation (<ref type="biblio">Watson et al. 2013</ref>). Their<lb/> experience in this sphere can therefore also help the Zambian government support the IGGS process, for<lb/> example through sharing lessons learned and good practice, including from related experience elsewhere.<lb/> This paper illustrates the foundations of green growth in Zambia and provides an overview of green<lb/> development co-operation efforts in the country from</p>

			<table>2004 to 2012. Section 2 discusses on-going efforts<lb/> towards greening growth in Zambia. Section 3 looks at total bilateral green Official Development<lb/> Assistance (ODA) flows from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and<lb/> Development&apos;s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries, i.e. targeting<lb/> biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other<lb/> environmental objectives. This analysis draws on OECD DAC statistics, in particular the Creditor<lb/> Reporting System (CRS). 3 It describes the sectors targeted, as well as the instruments used, and discusses<lb/> the degree of alignment between Zambian priorities and providers&apos; activities. Section 4 then explores<lb/> specific provider co-ordination efforts and strategies to support the mainstreaming of green issues in-<lb/>country. The paper concludes with a number of questions that could guide further research on this topic in<lb/> Zambia and beyond.<lb/> TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH IN ZAMBIA<lb/> Zambia&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average by 6.3% over 2004-13 (World Bank, 2014)<lb/> stimulated by economic reforms, infrastructure investments, a better educated population and the<lb/> development of natural resources (Murray McIntire, 2014). A number of environmentally sensitive sectors<lb/> are responsible for this growth, notably mining (copper, cobalt, lead), tourism, agriculture (maize) or<lb/> forestry (Aongola et al., 2009; Banda and Bass, 2014). The mining sector, in particular, contributed to over<lb/> a third of Zambia&apos;s GDP and 70% of its export value on average during that period (Government of<lb/> Zambia, 2011a). Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed another 15% and provided for up to 80% of<lb/> all livelihoods (FAO, 2009; Government of Zambia, 2010b). According to the World Bank, environmental<lb/> assets amount to 27% of all assets available for Zambia&apos;s development (with other assets being financial,<lb/> infrastructure, social, and human in nature). Cropland and forests are particularly abundant in Zambia<lb/> (World Bank, 2006), yet this figure may actually be underestimated as the measurement of environmental<lb/> assets excludes the value of many ecosystem services (Aongola et al., 2009).<lb/> The benefits of growth have not been widely shared across different income groups in Zambia. Poverty<lb/> stood at 64% of the population in 2013 (down from 68% in 1996; Government of Zambia<ref type="biblio">, 2012</ref>), and the<lb/> poor largely depend on rapidly shrinking or vulnerable environmental assets to sustain their incomes and<lb/> livelihoods (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2012</ref>). This is especially the case in rural areas, which account for<lb/> 60% of the population. Population growth, rural flight, rapid urbanisation and a growing middle-class are<lb/> further straining an already fragile environmental balance (<ref type="biblio">Aongola et al., 2009</ref>). As a result, Zambia<lb/> appears unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 to provide adequate clean water and<lb/> sanitation, to slow the rate of deforestation, and to protect biodiversity by 2015 (Government of Zambia,<lb/> 2012).<lb/> In other words, Zambia&apos;s recent growth has been natural resource intensive, leading to problems of<lb/> environmental degradation and heightened climate change-related risks (see Box 1). However, growth has<lb/> not translated into rapid poverty and inequality reduction rates (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2014</ref>). Zambia aims to<lb/> become a middle-income country by 2030 (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2006b</ref>) but achieving this goal will<lb/> require a long-term strategy to manage its green assets in a sustainable manner.<lb/> Realising the potential benefits of green growth, the Zambian government aims to develop an Inclusive<lb/> Green Growth Strategy (IGGS) (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2012</ref>). Although an official, comprehensive<lb/> definition is still to be developed, a preliminary understanding has already emerged on what green growth<lb/> means in the Zambian context. Namely, green growth refers to inclusive development that makes<lb/> sustainable and equitable use of Zambia&apos;s natural resources within ecological limits (<ref type="biblio">Banda and Bass,<lb/> 2014</ref>). More specifically, green growth is seen as a deliberate, progressive and incremental move away<lb/> from a carbon intensive economic model of growth to one compatible with sustainable development; it<lb/> aims to fulfil short-and medium-term needs, such as reducing unemployment, poverty and inequality, and<lb/> long-term needs, such as overcoming infrastructure deficits, connecting to markets worldwide and<lb/> supporting urban growth (Government of Zambia 2012; <ref type="biblio">Banda and Bass, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Climate change and deforestation in Zambia<lb/></head>

			<p>Climate change is expected to have important impacts in Zambia. By the end of the first decade of the 21st<lb/> century, mean temperatures are estimated to be 1.3 degrees C warmer and precipitation patterns 2.3%<lb/> rainfall lower per decade on average since the 1960s (<ref type="biblio">McSweeney et al., 2008</ref>). Temperatures are<lb/> projected to increase by another 1.2 -3.4 degrees C and rainfall to decrease by a further 8-10% by 2060<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hertel et al., 2010; Dell et al., 2012</ref>). This is likely to modify the catchment areas of the major Zambezi<lb/> river watershed (with lower levels in dry seasons and higher in wet seasons); to increase evaporation in<lb/> deep lakes (e.g. levels in the lake Tanganyika are decreasing due to the combined effect of drought,<lb/> warming and human activities; IPCC, 2014); to change the climate of the Zambian highlands, but to reduce<lb/> annual runoff by 30-50% under a scenario of warming above 2.7 degrees C by 2060-80 (<ref type="biblio">Dell et al., 2012;<lb/> IPCC, 2014</ref>). Extreme weather events are also predicted to increase in frequency. Floods, droughts and<lb/> heavy rainfall are already increasing in intensity and frequency (<ref type="biblio">Fumpa-Makano, 2011</ref>). Lusaka and other<lb/> urban areas of Zambia are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as severe heat, heavy<lb/> rainfall and flooding due to the growth of informal settlements, reliance on urban agriculture to sustain the<lb/> livelihoods of the urban poor, and low levels of piped water, sewerage and electricity access (<ref type="biblio">Heath et al.,<lb/> 2010</ref>).<lb/> As a result, climate change impacts are expected to alter the prospects for sustainable development in<lb/> Zambia. In particular, unmitigated climate change is expected to:<lb/> compromise agricultural and livestock-based livelihood security by lowering agricultural growth by 1% p.a.<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">AfDB, 2013</ref>),<lb/> negatively impact water quality and availability as well as human health (e.g. increased incidence of<lb/> climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria, cholera and dysentery; FAO, 2009; IPCC, 2014),<lb/> put at risk vital infrastructure, including hydro-power generation and at urban level (UN-HABITAT, 2014),<lb/> harm biological diversity, forestry and agricultural productivity and increase price volatility (e.g. reduction in<lb/> fish stocks, soil erosion, decreased soil fertility; Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Since 2003, Zambia has suffered losses in GDP estimated at USD 13.8 billion due to floods and droughts<lb/> and is it is expected to lose over USD 2 billion per year (amounting to 0.9% to 1.5% of its annual GDP<lb/> growth) due to climate change through 2020 (Government of Zambia, 2011a), while lower agricultural<lb/> productivity due to climate change will cost USD 4.3 billion in GDP over the next decade (<ref type="biblio">AfDB, 2013</ref>). The<lb/> estimated loss of agricultural potential due to climate variability is USD 2.2 -3.1 billion of GDP per year<lb/> until 2020 (representing up to 2% of its annual GDP growth; Government of Zambia, 2011a).<lb/> In Zambia, forests provide edible products (e.g. caterpillars, mushrooms, honey), fuel in the form of<lb/> firewood or charcoal and health services through medicinal plants. However, charcoal markets and<lb/> agricultural needs are driving deforestation (IDLO and FAO, 2011). The rate of deforestation is estimated<lb/> to be the second highest per capita in Africa and the fifth highest in the world (estimated at 4,000 km2 of<lb/></p>

			<table>forests lost every year from 1990 to 2005; see UNDP 2008), causing further land degradation and<lb/> desertification (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2011a; Watson et al., 2013).<lb/> Source: AfDB, (2013) African Development Report 2012: Towards Green Growth in Africa, Tunis, African Development Bank; Dell,<lb/> M. et al., (2012) Temperature Shocks and Economic Growth: Evidence from the Last Half Century, American Economic Journal:<lb/> Macroeconomics 4(3): 66-95; FAO (2009), Conservation Agriculture Scaling Up for Increased Productivity and Production, Rome:<lb/> FAO; Fumpa-Makano, R.

			<p>). Over time, green issues, understood here to<lb/> encompass biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification and local<lb/> environmental issues, have progressively gained more space in these documents (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). As the<lb/> implementation of these documents is meant to guide further decision-and policy-making, a number of<lb/> green institutions and processes have been established to help with the mainstreaming process and have<lb/> supported the implementation of several programmes and policies at the national and local levels (<ref type="biblio">Banda<lb/> and Bass, 2014</ref>; see Annex 1 for an overview). These developments are likely to inform the formulation of<lb/> a Zambian IGGS in the future.<lb/></p>

			<p>In light of these strategies and plans, Zambia is considered a &quot; frontrunner &quot; with respect to green planning<lb/> and policy-making in Africa (<ref type="biblio">Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014</ref>), displaying strong political will to<lb/> engage on green issues (<ref type="biblio">Watson et al., 2013</ref>) and relatively high levels of awareness among decision<lb/> makers and the general public on these issues (<ref type="biblio">Aongola et al., 2009</ref>). Looking forward, it is expected that<lb/> the Seventh NDP (2016-20) will serve as a framework for a Zambian IGGS once it is developed, bringing<lb/> more coherence and capacity to manage green issues at national and local levels (<ref type="biblio">Banda and Bass, 2014</ref>).<lb/> To date, most of Zambia&apos;s environmental projects and programmes have been largely supported by the<lb/> international development co-operation community (<ref type="biblio">Watson et al., 2013</ref>). It is widely understood that<lb/> providers of development assistance can help developing countries transition towards green growth (AfDB<lb/> and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). They can offer finance, help transfer knowledge, build capacity and<lb/> promote learning, open markets for green goods and services, as well as support reforms in legal<lb/> frameworks and collective action agreements to create a basis for new green activities at sectoral, local<lb/> and/or national level (<ref type="biblio">Aongola et al., 2009; OECD, 2013</ref>). A Zambian IGGS could therefore also build<lb/> upon the support of providers of development co-operation and their experience in this space.<lb/></p>

			<table>Zambian priorities and the increasing number of green activities have also provided a framework for<lb/> development co-operation providers to act in this area. In particular, alignment between providers&apos;<lb/> activities and Zambian priorities has been facilitated by the on-going work of the Joint Assistance Strategy<lb/> for Zambia (JASZ). The JASZ was created to co-ordinate the activities of providers in Zambia<lb/> (Government of Zambia, 2006a), and constitutes a response to the Paris Declaration on ODA Effectiveness<lb/> and its five principles (OECD, 2005) and the Accra Agenda of Action (OECD, 2008; see Box 2).<lb/> Box 5. International principles on aid effectiveness and effective development co-operation<lb/> The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (OECD, 2005) outlines five fundamental principles for<lb/> making ODA more effective, born out of decades of experience of what works and what does not work<lb/> for development:<lb/> • Ownership: Developing countries set their own strategies for poverty reduction, improve their<lb/> institutions and tackle corruption.<lb/></table>

			<figure>• Alignment: Development co-operation providers align behind these objectives and use local<lb/> systems.<lb/> • Harmonisation: Providers co-ordinate, simplify procedures and share information to avoid<lb/> duplication.<lb/> • Results: Developing countries and providers shift focus to development results and results get<lb/> measured.<lb/> • Mutual accountability: Providers and developing countries are accountable for results.<lb/> These principles are further elaborated by the Busan Declaration, which fleshed out some of these<lb/> to form the foundation of effective development co-operation, namely:<lb/> • Ownership of development priorities by developing countries: Partnerships for<lb/> development can only succeed if they are led by developing countries, implementing<lb/> approaches that are tailored to country-specific situations and needs.<lb/> • Focus on results: Investments and efforts must have a lasting impact on eradicating poverty<lb/> and reducing inequality, on sustainable development, and on enhancing developing countries&apos;<lb/> capacities, aligned with the priorities and policies set out by developing countries themselves.<lb/> • Inclusive development partnerships: Openness, trust, and mutual respect and learning lie<lb/> at the core of effective partnerships in support of development goals, recognising the different<lb/> and complementary roles of all actors.<lb/> • Transparency and accountability to each other: Mutual accountability and accountability to<lb/></figure>

			<p>the intended beneficiaries of co-operation efforts, as well as to respective citizens,<lb/> organisations, constituents and shareholders, is critical to delivering results. Transparent<lb/> practices form the basis for enhanced accountability.<lb/> All members of the OECD DAC have endorsed these principles, which are applicable to all<lb/> development co-operation activities. Implementation of these principles and commitments to integrate<lb/> them into development co-operation activities of DAC members is well under way and the OECD has<lb/> been monitoring progress since 2006 (OECD, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>GENERAL TRENDS IN GREEN ODA IN ZAMBIA<lb/> Trends in total external development finance to Zambia<lb/></head>

			<p>Zambia was classified as a Least Developed Country (LDC) in 1991. 4 It reached Lower Middle-Income<lb/> Country (LMIC) status in 2011 due to reductions in poverty and sustained growth (OECD, 2011a). 5<lb/> Political stability and strong growth have improved investor confidence, as evidenced in the issue of two<lb/> oversubscribed Euro bonds raising USD 750 million (<ref type="biblio">Watson et al., 2013</ref>), or the increase in</p>

			<figure>Foreign<lb/> Direct Investment from USD 164 million in 2003 to USD 1.7 billion in 2010 (World Bank, 2012). In light<lb/> of this, Zambia is increasingly less reliant on ODA: total ODA as a percentage of Gross National Income<lb/> (GNI) steadily declined from 29% in 2004-06 to 11% in 2010-12 (Chart 1), in line with a general<lb/> downward trend of ODA to Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years (OECD, 2014c).<lb/> Chart 1.

			<table>Since 2004, total bilateral and multilateral ODA flows committed to Zambia have fallen from USD 1.9<lb/> billion in 2004-06 to USD 1.1 billion in 2010-12 (Chart 1). 6 Bilateral ODA provided by DAC member<lb/> countries, including the European Union (EU) institutions, has generally been the largest source,<lb/> representing 68% of total ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 730 million), falling from USD 1.6 billion<lb/> in 2004-06 and 85% of total ODA commitments to Zambia. Multilateral commitments, in turn, reached<lb/> USD 350 million over 2010-12, growing by 16% compared to 2004-06. 7<lb/></table>

			<head>Trends in total domestic and external green development finance to Zambia 8<lb/></head>

			<p>This section looks at domestic levels of green finance and provides an overview of green external<lb/> development finance in Zambia. 9 Domestic sources of green finance have generally been low: the<lb/> investments associated with the environment chapter of the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP)<lb/> stood at 2% of the national budget according to the medium-term expenditure framework of the FNDP<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Aongola et al., 2009</ref>). Environmental protection, pollution control, environmental and climate change<lb/> mainstreaming represented only 3% of the national budget in 2011 (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2011b</ref>). By<lb/> contrast, governmental allocation to climate change adaptation and mitigation in the national budget was<lb/> on average 7% of total resources over 2008-2012 (<ref type="biblio">Mulenga, 2013</ref>). With the Sixth National Development<lb/> Plan (SNDP), the government planned to increase its green funding by 33% for the 2011-15 period<lb/> compared to 2006-10 (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2011b</ref>). However, this would still leave green investments<lb/> heavily dependent on external support from providers of development co-operation (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2006a, 2008; Mulenga, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Total green bilateral ODA committed by the members of the OECD DAC reached 30% of total ODA<lb/> commitments to the country over 2010-12 (USD 230 million), up from 6% of total bilateral ODA<lb/> commitments over 2004-06 (USD 90 million; Chart 2), increasing at a time when total ODA volumes were<lb/> 8<lb/> This paper only provides a partial picture of total green ODA flows to Zambia, based on the activities of bilateral<lb/> providers of development co-operation. An integrated, full picture including multilateral providers is still missing at<lb/> the time of writing.<lb/> 9<lb/> Total bilateral green ODA commitments are calculated using the OECD DAC CRS as being the total ODA<lb/> commitments marked as principal or significant with the environment marker, plus additional ODA to climate change<lb/> adaptation marked principal or significant, additional ODA to climate change mitigation marked principal or<lb/> significant, additional ODA to biodiversity marked principal or significant, and additional ODA to desertification<lb/> marked principal or significant. Care has been taken to aggregate these figures to ensure there is no double counting<lb/> where activities target multiple environmental objectives. For a further description of the CRS database and the Rio<lb/> markers methodology, see Annex 1.<lb/> falling (Chart 1). These green flows include ODA targeting local environment objectives, as well as global<lb/> objectives enshrined in the three Rio Conventions (biodiversity, climate change and desertification). 10<lb/> Chart 2. Trends in total green ODA to Zambia<lb/> 2004-2012, bilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices, 3-year annual averages<lb/> Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: The adaptation marker was introduced in 2010 so reported figures over 2004-09<lb/> may appear lower than in practice, and may reflect a break in the series given pre-2010 adaptation spend was not monitored;<lb/></figure>

			<p>Activities are classified as either having principal or significant green objectives (see Annex 1 for further<lb/> information on the Rio Markers methodology). On the one hand, principal activities are activities where<lb/> green issues are central and where the activity would not have gone ahead without having a green<lb/> dimension. The amount of ODA having green principal objectives is relatively low in Zambia, with<lb/> volumes varying over 2004-2012, and reaching USD 26 million over 2010-12 (see Chart 2). On the other<lb/> hand, activities that providers score as significant have other prime objectives but have been formulated or<lb/> adjusted to help meet green concerns, and failure to take this dimension into account would have not<lb/> prevented the activity from going ahead. In Zambia, the majority of green ODA is marked as having a<lb/> significant objective, accounting for 88% of all green ODA committed to the country over 2010-12 (<ref type="biblio">USD<lb/> 192</ref> million), up from 2004-06 when it represented 77% of total ODA (USD 75 million). This suggests<lb/> high levels of mainstreaming of green concerns across the portfolios of development co-operation<lb/> providers.<lb/> 10<lb/> OECD DAC members did not monitor all their green development finance during 2004-09, e.g. monitoring climate<lb/> change mitigation only became mandatory in 2006, and climate change adaptation was only monitored after 2010. As<lb/> a result, part of the increase observed in Zambia also reflects improvements in the statistical coverage of green<lb/> development finance.<lb/> Chart 3. Total ODA supporting environmental and Rio Convention objectives in Zambia<lb/> 2004-12, bilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices, 3-year annual averages<lb/> Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: The ODA commitments to biodiversity, climate, desertification and local<lb/> environmental objectives displayed in this chart cannot be aggregated, as activities may target multiple objectives. Aggregated<lb/> figures, taking into account any overlaps between finance targeting multiple objectives have been taken into account for the<lb/> preparation of Chart 2. For further information on the methodology employed to avoid double counting, see Annex 1.<lb/> Looking at the components of green bilateral ODA commitments shows that the increase since 2004-06<lb/> has been primarily driven by climate-related ODA (Chart 3). Climate change adaptation represented 14%<lb/> of total climate-related ODA in 2010-12, reaching USD 46 million per year on average, while climate<lb/> change mitigation-related ODA accounted for 0.4% or USD 1.5 million over 2010-12 on average per year.<lb/> The remainder, or over 85% or USD 272 million per year on average targeted both climate change<lb/> adaptation and mitigation. During the same period, too, biodiversity-and desertification-related ODA<lb/> halved in volume to USD 19 million and USD 10 million respectively. Providers are also seeking synergies<lb/> within and across their green portfolios (Chart 4). An estimated USD 10 million or 7% of environment-<lb/>related ODA also targets all other green objectives; USD 17 million or 13% of environment-related ODA<lb/> also targets climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives; and all of the biodiversity and<lb/> desertification-related ODA, and virtually all of the adaptation-related ODA targets at least one other green<lb/> objective. That being said, 70% of total green ODA still targets climate change mitigation alone (USD 54<lb/> million); and 44% of environment-related ODA targets local environmental objectives only (USD 58<lb/> million).<lb/> Chart 4.

			<p>It is noteworthy that the climate-related development finance figures presented here may not be<lb/> comparable to those reported by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change<lb/> (UNFCC) in their National Communications, Biennial Reports, or Biennial Update Reports. Reporting to<lb/> the UNFCCC is often based on, but may not be directly comparable to the OECD DAC Rio marker data<lb/> presented here as different methodologies are applied, in particular to account only for a certain share of<lb/> finance targeting climate change marked as a significant objective (<ref type="biblio">Ockenden and Gaveau, 2014<lb/></ref> forthcoming). During 2008-12 (covering the 2010-12 period of Fast-start Finance period), climate<lb/> financing to Zambia amounted to USD 24 million, or USD 8 million on average per year. (Mulenga, 2013).<lb/> This has been primarily provided through grants originating from Germany&apos;s International Climate<lb/> Initiative, the Global Environmental Facility-Administered Trust Fund and the United Nations<lb/> Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN<lb/> REDD+), aimed at climate change mitigation. In addition, a grant from Japan&apos;s Fast Start Finance focused<lb/> on climate change adaptation. The Climate Investment Funds (CFIs), in particular, have also been a key<lb/> international driver for the increase in climate change adaptation finance to Zambia, as the country was<lb/> included in its Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR; Box 3).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Box 6. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience in Zambia<lb/></head>

			<p>The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is funded by the Strategic Climate Fund, one of<lb/> the two Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). It is designed to demonstrate ways that developing countries<lb/> can make climate risk and resilience part of their core development planning. It helps countries build on<lb/> their National Adaptation Programs of Action and helps fund public and private sector investments<lb/> identified in climate resilient development plans.<lb/> In Zambia, the African Development Bank (AfDB) worked closely with the government and other<lb/> partners to develop a PPCR investment strategy in line with national development priorities, including<lb/> strengthening early warning weather systems, integrating climate resilience in infrastructure planning<lb/> and investments, and strengthening the adaptive capacity and livelihood of farmers and natural<lb/> ecosystems in the most affected areas of southern and western Zambia.<lb/></p>

			<p>To date, Zambia has received a PPCR programme development grant of USD 1.5 million to<lb/> support preparation of its PPCR investment strategy, the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience.<lb/> The AfDB is supporting this phase by providing input on mainstreaming climate resilience into national<lb/> development planning; strengthening institutional co-ordination, improving information for decision-<lb/>makers; and shaping targeted awareness and communication. This provided individual ministries the<lb/> mandate to work on climate change issues, because budget allocations were linked to the strategy; has<lb/> also strengthened country ownership and effectiveness by promoting institutional reforms on adaptation<lb/> planning; and succeeded to change and improve the political economy context through concessional<lb/> finance (Climate Investment Funds, 2014). Finally, this has also translated into three concrete<lb/> interventions covering a range of sectors, e.g. two projects on building resilience in land-based<lb/> livelihoods and infrastructure in two river sub-basins and a project on private sector support for climate<lb/> resilience in those same sub-basins.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sectors targeted by green ODA in Zambia<lb/></head>

			<p>This section details the sectors that DAC member countries are targeting with their green ODA. This<lb/> analysis can be used to inform and assess the extent of alignment between the sectors prioritised by the<lb/> government of Zambia and those targeted by providers&apos; interventions. The issue of alignment has been<lb/> scantly studied in the case of green ODA (but see <ref type="biblio">Thornston et al., 2011</ref> who look at climate finance in<lb/> various African countries; <ref type="biblio">Terpstra et al., 2013</ref> who explore national adaptation priorities and international<lb/> adaptation finance flows in Zambia and other developing countries; or Drutschinin and Casado-Asensio,<lb/> forthcoming, who study biodiversity-related development co-operation in Zambia and other developing<lb/> countries). Alignment implies that providers base their support on partner countries&apos; national development<lb/> strategies, institutions and processes (see Box 2). For example, providers aim to increasingly use country<lb/> systems for programmes managed by the public sector. In return, partner countries improve the quality and<lb/> transparency of their public financial management systems. A lack of alignment leads to unsustainable<lb/> outcomes, as well as undermining national institutions and processes; while alignment reflects efforts to<lb/> build the institutional strength of partner countries (<ref type="biblio">Birdsall and Kharas, 2014</ref>). By supporting this<lb/> dimension, providers signal their willingness to make a long-term investment in partners&apos; ability to develop<lb/> and implement their own strategies.<lb/> In the case of Zambia, there is alignment between the sectors targeted by providers and with those<lb/> highlighted by the Zambian government in the FNDP and SNDP. Inter alia, the FNDP (2006-10)<lb/> highlighted agriculture, while the SNDP (2011-15) also highlighted energy, fisheries, livestock, tourism,<lb/> transport and the water sectors (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Providers have been consistently prioritising agriculture,<lb/> forestry, fishing and rural development over 2010-12 (22% of all green ODA to Zambia, or USD 39<lb/> million on average per year over that period, primarily driven by agriculture). Following this, are the<lb/> sectors of water supply and sanitation and energy (each accounting for 19%, or USD 35 million), transport<lb/> and storage (7%, or USD 14 million), general environmental protection (4%, or USD 7 million), other<lb/> social infrastructure and services (4%, or USD 6 million) and trade and tourism (3% or USD 6 million; see<lb/> Chart 5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Chart 5. Total green-related ODA by sector<lb/> 2010-2012, bilateral commitments<lb/></head>

			<p>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: 1) General budget support interventions are not targeted at a specific sector. In<lb/> principle, the Rio marker methodology cannot be applied to this &quot; sector &quot; , hence the data presented is only partial; 2) General<lb/> Environmental Protection includes support to environmental research, education, policy and administration management; 3) The<lb/> Other Social Infrastructure and Services category comprises social and welfare services, employment policy and administrative<lb/> management, housing policy and administrative management, low-cost housing, and multi-sector ODA for basic social services.<lb/></p>

			<p>Priorities for allocating green ODA can also be assessed based on the extent to which environmental<lb/> considerations have been integrated into development co-operation support. Total sector support between<lb/> 2004 and 2012 shows that environmental considerations are well integrated into ODA supporting a number<lb/> of key sectors for Zambia&apos;s development -based on the share of total ODA to each sectors that targets a<lb/> green objectives (Chart 6) -such as forestry (99%), energy (95%), water supply and sanitation (67%),<lb/> tourism (61%) or agriculture (54%). For example:<lb/> • Agriculture is a key sector in Zambia. It was declared the &quot; engine of income expansion in the<lb/> economy &quot; by both the FNDP and SNDP</p>

			<table>(Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2010a), yet is also seen<lb/> as being particularly vulnerable to climate change. The draft National Climate Change Response<lb/> Strategy (Government of Zambia, 2010b) and the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience<lb/> (Climate Investment Funds, 2011), were in fact developed to implement the NDPs and to<lb/> prioritise agriculture (see Watson et al., 2012; UN-HABITAT, 2014).<lb/> • Green support to the forestry sector predominantly comes from Finland to build government<lb/> capacity to value, map and sustainably manage the country&apos;s forests (Leventon, et al., 2014). This<lb/> is aligned with the government&apos;s Zambia Forestry Action Plan and National Forest Policy of<lb/> 1998 aiming to achieve Joint Forest Management in Zambia.<lb/> • The high share of green ODA in the energy sector can be attributed to the expansion of energy<lb/> access from hydro-power (Zambia is a water rich-country, accounting for 40% of the water<lb/> resources of Southern Africa; UN-HABITAT, 2014), and to the government&apos;s intentions to<lb/> continue expanding hydro-power and biofuel plants during the SNDP period (Government of<lb/> Zambia, 2010a) and to climate-proof existing infrastructure (e.g. so that droughts do not impact<lb/> negatively on energy generation which in turn affects industrial production).<lb/> • ODA to water supply and sanitation, but also to the transport and storage sector, have a green<lb/> dimension in Zambia because providers have focused on climate-proofing existing infrastructure,<lb/> as prioritised by the government&apos;s SNDP (Government of Zambia, 2010a). For example,<lb/> transport interventions comprise three environmental assessments funded by the United States,<lb/> plus other activities focusing on road construction and rehabilitation funded by Denmark and<lb/> Japan to ensure that the increased frequency and severity of floods does not destroy roads as has<lb/> happened in the past.<lb/> Chart 6. Percentage of ODA targeting green objectives by sector<lb/> 2010-12, bilateral commitments<lb/> Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014<lb/> Providers&apos; activities also coincide with respect to the emphasis placed upon capacity-building. Indeed,<lb/> many small-volume activities also focus on the General Environmental Protection sector, 11 which is<lb/> identified as the centrepiece to develop the FNDP, SNDP and the IGGS (Banda and Bass, 2014). In fact,<lb/> 19% of all green ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 had capacity-building as its objective. 12 Three notable<lb/> activities in this sector are:<lb/> • A programme funded by the United Kingdom&apos;s Department for International Development<lb/> (DfID) to integrate climate resilience into development planning, and to provide support to<lb/> priority public and private climate-proofed investments. This programme ran over 2009-12 and<lb/> targeted climate change mitigation and biodiversity as principal objectives. The programme<lb/> included contracting a consultant to identify links between climate change and development, and<lb/> to suggest appropriate policies.<lb/> • A programme led by the Finnish Environmental Institute to support institutional capacity<lb/> building in the then Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR). The<lb/> programme was implemented during 2009-12 and comprised five mutually defined components:<lb/> improving human resource management (including training on environmental monitoring),<lb/> environmental information management, strategic environmental assessment, biodiversity and the<lb/> implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna<lb/> and Flora and the Basel, Stockholm, and Rotterdam Conventions.<lb/> • Finally, in 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture provided support to reduce<lb/> pollution across multiple sectors. The initiative set out to improve environmental sustainability.<lb/> By reducing environmental risks, the programme aimed to reduce health costs and ecosystem<lb/> loss.<lb/></table>

			<p>Notwithstanding the observed sectoral alignment and the emphasis placed to develop domestic-level<lb/> capacity, there are also a number of gaps, for example:<lb/> • Mining, which has a high impact on Zambia&apos;s economy and environment (<ref type="biblio">Aongola et al., 2009</ref>).<lb/> Zambia&apos;s mining sector is specialised on the extraction of copper and cobalt. Mining activity<lb/> consumes substantial volumes of electricity (<ref type="biblio">Kivyiro and Arminen, 2014</ref>), primarily relying on<lb/> hydro-power in Zambia and making the sector vulnerable to water scarcity and climate change.<lb/> Despite recent signs of a green transformation in this sector (<ref type="biblio">AfDB and OECD, 2013</ref>) and the<lb/> fact that mining sites have to perform environmental impact assessments (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2011a</ref>), change is slow and enforcement of environmental legislation poor (<ref type="biblio">Leventon et<lb/> al., 2014</ref>); and the sector struggles to manage waste (<ref type="biblio">AfDB and OECD, 2013</ref>).<lb/> • Tourism has the potential to be an effective means for achieving economic and social<lb/> development in destination areas, notably through community-based eco-tourism (<ref type="biblio">Lachlan and<lb/> Binns, 2014</ref>). Although the data show that over 2010-12, 61% of all interventions had a green<lb/> objective, the volume devoted to the sector was small (under USD 100,000 over 2010-12), owing<lb/> to a Japanese intervention aiming to improve tourism policy and administrative management. No<lb/> green intervention had been recorded in this sector previously, despite being mentioned already<lb/> in the FNDP; and the fact that tourism may help Zambia diversify its economy and decouple its<lb/> development from fluctuations in the world price of copper and other raw materials.<lb/> • Urban development, according to a recent review of DAC CRS data looking for interventions<lb/> targeting climate change adaptation at urban level for the years 2010-12, no explicit projects<lb/> could be identified on the matter in Lusaka, Ndola or Kitwe, despite high levels of vulnerability<lb/> and the prioritisation of interventions at this level by the government (UN-HABITAT, 2014). 13<lb/></p>

			<head>Instruments used for green ODA<lb/></head>

			<p>The majority of green ODA over 2004-12 (87%) is committed through grants (Chart 7). While ODA to<lb/> biodiversity, climate change adaptation, and desertification only takes the form of grants (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Teprstra<lb/> et al. 2013</ref>), 40% of the ODA targeting climate change mitigation takes the form of concessional loans.<lb/> This is in line with Zambia&apos;s Aid Policy and Strategy, which states that &quot; although it is the policy of the<lb/> country to progressively reduce its dependence on external assistance, the government shall give<lb/> preference to grants as opposed to loans &quot; (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2005</ref>). The government also targets<lb/> concessional finance and loans with a minimum 35% grant element (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Chart 7. Green-related ODA by instrument<lb/> 2004-12, bilateral commitments<lb/> Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014<lb/></figure>

			<p>The majority of green bilateral ODA consists of project-type interventions (57%). Green ODA is also<lb/> channelled through general budget support. Data collected within the OECD DAC CRS is only partial<lb/> reflecting that the &quot; Rio markers &quot; are not applicable to general budget support – but available data suggests<lb/> that at least USD 26 million per year on average over 2010-12 has been channelled as green ODA through<lb/> general budget support, consisting of four large Poverty Reduction Budget Support transfers from Finland<lb/> and Germany.<lb/></p>

			<head>13<lb/></head>

			<p>This finding is based on a review of ODA activities within DAC members&apos; climate change adaptation portfolios<lb/> that target cities of over 500,000 inhabitants. Over 200 out of 1600 activities (above USD 50,000) were identified<lb/> as targeting urban areas, based on the methodological approach developed for this study. This number may be<lb/> considered a lower bound, owing to limited information available to identify the location of some ODA activities<lb/> (OECD, 2014d). For further information see: http://oe.cd/RioMarkers<lb/></p>

			<head>CO-ORDINATION AND MAINSTREAMING OF GREEN ODA IN ZAMBIA<lb/></head>

			<p>Providers have made considerable progress in ensuring harmonisation amongst their green activities and to<lb/> align these with Zambia&apos;s priorities through a provider co-ordination group, the Joint Assistance Strategy<lb/> for Zambia (JASZ) (<ref type="biblio">Aogonda et al. 2009</ref>). The JASZ responds to broader concerns from the development<lb/> co-operation community that providers&apos; practices did not always fit well with national development<lb/> priorities and systems such as budget, programme and project planning cycles (see Box 2). The demands<lb/> on partner countries to meet with different providers&apos; objectives, reporting processes and procedures, along<lb/> with uncoordinated country analytical work and missions may create excessive transaction costs and<lb/> reduce the effectiveness of development co-operation. Providers and partner countries therefore have<lb/> recognised that urgent, co-ordinated and sustained action is required to reduce overlap, waste and<lb/> fragmentation among providers and to reduce the burden placed upon partner countries (<ref type="biblio">Birdsall and<lb/> Kharas, 2014</ref>). This section explores the green activities of the JASZ since 2007 and how this has helped<lb/> mainstream green activities into the portfolios of development co-operation providers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Provider co-ordination efforts: the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia<lb/></head>

			<p>The JASZ is an instrument developed by 16 DAC and multilateral providers to co-ordinate their activities<lb/> and align these with the country&apos;s national development priorities. The Strategy is periodically reviewed<lb/> and updated with the introduction of successive NDPs. There are no specific projects under the JASZ,<lb/> rather the co-operating partners use the JASZ to inform their development co-operation projects and<lb/> programmes in-country (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia I: 2007-2010<lb/></head>

			<p>The first JASZ I and its priority sectors were based on the FNDP. According to the agreed division of<lb/> labour, the Nordic countries were meant to work on green issues; the EU, the US, Sweden, and the<lb/> development banks supported the agriculture sector; while the Netherlands, development banks and the<lb/> UK supported private sector development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <ref type="biblio">Finland, 2010</ref>). Co-operating<lb/> partners also committed to increase their funding of green issues. In line with the FNDP, the co-operating<lb/> partners together with the government of Zambia, civil society and the private sector identified the<lb/> following priority areas as a target for green ODA (<ref type="biblio">Irish Aid, 2008; Aongola et al., 2009</ref>; Ministry of<lb/> Foreign Affairs of <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>):<lb/> • increasing capacity building efforts and funding for environmental planning and mainstreaming;<lb/> • introducing strategic environmental assessments at the national and sector levels, and<lb/> strengthening the application of environmental impact assessments, including participatory<lb/> approaches, to ensure the effective mainstreaming of green issues;<lb/> • carrying out joint analytical work with the government to support knowledge management;<lb/> • focusing on fisheries, forests, land, renewable energy and wildlife, and ensuring sufficient<lb/> attention is paid to climate change adaptation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The co-operating partners&apos; targeting of these priorities were meant to assist Zambia in achieving<lb/> Millennium Development Goal 7 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>). Additionally, Zambia<lb/> worked to reform and enhance the capacity of its government institutions, including its statutory bodies<lb/> aiming to help fulfil their mandates; to strengthen cross-sectoral co-ordination mechanisms; to address<lb/> equity and transparency issues in the access and control of resources; to capture the contribution of green<lb/> issues on the national economy and its impact in poverty alleviation; and to assess the impact of natural<lb/> resource base degradation on growth pillars such as agriculture and tourism (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>).<lb/> The Strategy led to a more structured process to support the green dimension in Zambian development<lb/> policy and its strategy (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). As a mechanism, the JASZ I<lb/> helped identify improvements in provider activity and in providing an effective model for greater sector-<lb/>level co-ordination on green issues (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Information sharing<lb/> through the JASZ I reduced duplication of activities and, where relevant, provided more co-ordinated<lb/> support to the development of government systems. The dialogue architecture that emerged from the<lb/> Strategy made a considerable contribution to encouraging harmonisation. Indeed, the co-operating<lb/> partners&apos; troika structure, whereby three co-operating partners represent the JASZ I signatories in dialogue<lb/> with the government of Zambia, was generally perceived as successful and as having improved the flow of<lb/> information (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010).<lb/> However, the co-operating partners identified generic drawbacks that significantly weakened its ability to<lb/> achieve its objectives (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p>• The Strategy neither contains specific targets nor does it define indicators against which progress<lb/> can be measured. A work plan was developed in late 2007 and some of its elements were<lb/> implemented. However, no work plans and no systematic processes to follow up on the<lb/> commitments and actions were subsequently agreed.<lb/> • The government of Zambia was initially neither a signatory to the JASZ I nor to the work plan,<lb/> despite the success of the JASZ I depending on governmental actions. In addition, there were<lb/> doubts regarding the government&apos;s leadership in this process and the capacity for the Ministry of<lb/> Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) to manage ODA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>). The government is now aware of this and has taken steps to develop a<lb/> mechanism for taking an effective cross-sector strategic view on green ODA issues and has<lb/> anchored these responsibilities within the MoFNP.<lb/> • Existing consultative mechanisms are driven by co-operating partners and often do not respect<lb/> governmental processes. The requirements of providers still dictate many actions and a number<lb/> of important decisions are taken bilaterally, which undermine JASZ I processes. The risks were<lb/> that the JASZ I may have resulted in leaving green issues entirely up to a few providers to lead,<lb/> offering vague mainstreaming promises for the portfolio of other providers engaged with the<lb/> JASZ I but not leading on green issues (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia II: 2011-2015<lb/></head>

			<p>JASZ II builds on the lessons learned from JASZ I, as well as on priorities identified in the SNDP. JASZ II<lb/> aims to channel co-operating partners&apos; investment in Zambia to: address rural poverty and inclusive<lb/> growth; support Zambia&apos;s longer term transition away from ODA; introduce a more robust focus on<lb/> performance measurement and ensure management accountability; and improve the flow and quality of<lb/> information and dialogue between co-operating partners and the government of Zambia and other local<lb/> non-state actors (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). In an effort to improve the effectiveness and<lb/> harmonisation of the JASZ with national processes, the government has committed to managing the<lb/> division of labour among co-operating partners in the various sectors (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ<lb/> II, 2011).<lb/> In the energy sector, co-operating partners commit to expanding generation capacity in the power sector<lb/> and to scaling up access to clean, modern energy, primarily in rural areas. Co-operating partners will focus<lb/> on supporting the government&apos;s efforts to exploit cost-effective hydro-power generation and transmission,<lb/> strengthening the framework of ensuring an efficient and effective fuel supply system, including through<lb/> locally produced, sustainable biofuels, in line with the SNDP (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011).<lb/> Co-operating partners will also continue to support the development of policies and legislation, and<lb/> increase community, civil society and private sector participation in forestry, wildlife and national heritage<lb/> to enhance sustainable management of natural resources. Co-operating partners will focus on the following<lb/> key areas, namely:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Mainstreaming green issues into the planning, programming and budgetary frameworks for<lb/> central economic growth sectors by promoting strategic policy dialogue, joint planning and<lb/> programming on green issues, in particular to develop the capacity for climate resilience and low<lb/> carbon development;<lb/> • Conducting ecosystem assessments to inform green decision making and investments;<lb/> • Developing monitoring and performance assessment indicators to track implementation of green<lb/> programmes across sectors;<lb/> • Supporting fiscal and market based incentive mechanisms to improve green management, in<lb/> particular in pollution control and waste management;<lb/> • Intensifying the implementation of adaptation and mitigation initiatives as well as positioning the<lb/> country to benefit from climate financing opportunities (e.g., the Green Climate Fund; Co-<lb/>operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011).<lb/> With the elections of 2011, however, ministerial portfolios and mandates changed, with implications for<lb/> the implementation of the JASZ II (<ref type="biblio">Watson et al., 2013</ref>). For example, after a period of uncertainty the<lb/> Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR) became the Ministry of Lands,<lb/> Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. The MTENR had led the preparation of the National<lb/> Climate Change Response Strategy since 2010 and had received support from Norway and the United<lb/> Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to establish a Facilitation Unit to co-ordinate climate change<lb/> activities in-country. With the governmental change, departments were reshuffled and annual departmental<lb/> and line budgets were housed in different ministries (<ref type="biblio">Watson et al., 2013</ref>). In turn, this has slowed the<lb/> drafting and implementation of many JASZ II proposals. Notwithstanding this, the government of Zambia<lb/> has remained engaged with the green agenda and created an Interim National Climate Change Secretariat,<lb/> now housed in the Ministry of Finance. The Secretariat is the focal point for developing the Zambian IGGS<lb/> and co-ordinates all international and domestic green programmes and projects with the JASZ II (e.g. the<lb/> USAID Low Emissions Development Strategy, the PPCR (see Box 3), or the UN Joint Climate Project<lb/> REDD-Low Emissions Capacity Building Programme).<lb/></p>

			<head>Provider strategies to mainstream green issues into development co-operation<lb/></head>

			<p>Green issues have been at the centre of many DAC providers&apos; ODA activities in Zambia. Chart 8 illustrates<lb/> the top nine green providers, accounting for 97% of total green bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2004-12.<lb/> Norway, Japan and Germany are the largest providers in absolute terms, and together account for 53% of<lb/> green ODA to Zambia. It is important to note that Japan, Norway, Denmark and Finland commit the<lb/> largest amount of ODA targeting green objectives as a principal objective over the same period. Green<lb/> ODA as a proportion of a provider&apos;s total ODA portfolio gives an indication of the priority that this<lb/> provider is placing on green issues. By this measure, Finland stands out in dedicating about 41% of its total<lb/> ODA commitments to Zambia to green issues, followed by Denmark and Norway (each 37%). This<lb/> reflects the division of labour of the JASZ I.<lb/></p>

			<p>Looking at the aims and outcomes of the most important projects of the three largest providers in relative<lb/> terms, Denmark, Finland and Norway, illustrates how provider activities align with the green priorities of<lb/> the Zambian government. Their interventions have taken various forms, ranging from planning and goal<lb/> setting support to promoting policy change, institutional capacity building and reform, monitoring and<lb/> evaluation (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Zambia aims to become a &quot; prosperous middle-income country &quot; by 2030 (Government of <ref type="biblio">Zambia, 2006b</ref>).<lb/> Achieving this will likely depend upon how Zambia manages its natural assets, controls pollution and<lb/> prepares for the impacts of climate change. In addition to a range of existing green plans and policies,<lb/> Zambia aims to develop an explicit and comprehensive Inclusive Green Growth Strategy, to ensure that<lb/> future development and growth takes green considerations more centrally into account. Importantly,<lb/> Zambia aims to ensure that the green dimension of economic growth and well-being is fully integrated and<lb/> has a higher profile in its development plans (see OECD, 2013 on the rationale for doing so). The process<lb/> of formulating this Strategy provides an opportunity to assess the environmental sustainability of existing<lb/> growth patterns and to identify the structural changes needed in the economy to ensure growth and poverty<lb/> reduction, while also protecting the environment. This process could not only build upon past domestic<lb/> experience with green policy-making and mainstreaming of environmental objectives into sector policies,<lb/> but also upon the experience of the international development co-operation community. Indeed, support<lb/> from the international development co-operation community has been increasingly important in Zambia<lb/> since 2004.<lb/> This paper reviewed to what extent development co-operation activities are aligned with Zambian priorities<lb/> and needs. The statistical analysis provided here finds that green ODA has targeted some of the economic<lb/> engines of Zambia (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and has significantly contributed to &quot; greening &quot; other key<lb/> domestic sectors, such as energy, water supply and sanitation, or transport. Furthermore, providers have<lb/> supported a range of capacity building activities, including environmental policy and legislation<lb/> formulation, data management, resource valuing, community engagement and benefit-sharing in the green<lb/> space. These activities are strongly aligned with the country&apos;s Long-Term Vision and its various National<lb/> Development Plans (see also Co-operating Partners to the JASZ I, 2007; Co-operating Partners to the<lb/> JASZ II, 2011). There is evidence, too, that alignment was informed by the Joint Assistance Strategy for<lb/> Zambia (JASZ). The JASZ I and II has helped co-ordinate 16 DAC providers active in Zambia, has<lb/> avoided the duplication of green projects and programmes, and has improved the information flow with the<lb/> government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <ref type="biblio">Denmark, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Despite strong alignment with Zambian priorities, the paper shows there is scope for further alignment<lb/> with Zambian priorities, and of co-ordination among providers and with the government (<ref type="biblio">Mulenga, 2013</ref>).<lb/> First, virtually no green bilateral ODA flowed to a number of key sectors for the Zambian economy, such<lb/> as mining, industry or tourism. The mining sector, in particular, is crucial for it generates up to 30% of<lb/> Zambia&apos;s GDP, creates substantial amounts of waste and pollution, and is vulnerable to water scarcity and<lb/> climate change. Second, green ODA has not yet demonstrated a link to the overarching developmental goal<lb/> of reducing poverty in Zambia. Poverty reduction is expected to require a private sector role (<ref type="biblio">Kivuitu et al.,<lb/> 2005</ref>), yet little is known about the activities of development co-operation providers to help make this link.<lb/> Third, development co-operation places relatively low emphasis on the mainstreaming of green issues into<lb/> local-level institutions and planning processes (<ref type="biblio">Terpstra et al. 2013; UN-HABITAT, 2014</ref>). This is<lb/> especially true at the urban level, where no projects could be identified in 2010-12, despite heightened<lb/> vulnerability at this level. Finally, the JASZ worked in an iterative manner to refine its approach and align<lb/> its work with Zambian priorities but struggled with Zambian bureaucracy, staff rotation and delays in the<lb/> process of working with line ministries. Strengthening the capacity of the Zambian government and its<lb/> institutions to more closely work with the JASZ could help to make development co-operation more<lb/> effective.<lb/></p>

			<p>These findings can support and inform the national agenda for action in Zambia to advance its green<lb/> growth agenda and Inclusive Green Growth Strategy (IGGS). They can also assist providers of<lb/> development co-operation to better target their activities. Notwithstanding this, further analytical work<lb/> could benefit the IGGS process. First, it would be important to understand how ODA dependence on green<lb/> matters is perceived by the Zambian government (e.g. exploring if the government interested in building<lb/> sufficient capacity and political support for green goals, the potential for self-or co-financing such<lb/> activities over time using domestic resources, and the role that providers could take to support these<lb/> developments). Second, and relatedly, Zambia could work with providers to develop, implement, and<lb/> evaluate new types of goals that sustain the &quot; greening &quot; of policy and practice over time. By setting clear<lb/> goals, by tracking outcomes or impacts, gaps and improvements regarding the mainstreaming of green<lb/> issues, providers and the Zambian government could improve their ODA effectiveness and better<lb/> understand what green ODA is achieving on the ground. Finally, there is potential to work with Zambian<lb/> stakeholders to understand better the potential pathways to improve harmonisation and alignment of<lb/> development co-operation with Zambian priorities. This could provide lessons, for example, on the<lb/> potential use of country systems, beyond national planning, to channel support; and might begin by<lb/> monitoring and evaluating relevant systems (e.g. mechanisms for internal co-ordination, budgetary and<lb/> financial management, and procurement systems).<lb/></p>

			<head>ANNEX 1: THE OECD DAC CREDITOR REPORTING SYSTEM AND THE RIO MARKERS<lb/></head>

			<p>Since 1998 the DAC has monitored development finance targeting the objectives of the Rio Conventions.<lb/> Data are reported by members of the OECD DAC, collected through the &quot;Creditor Reporting System&quot;<lb/> (CRS) and identified as using &quot; Rio markers &quot; , where providers are requested to indicate for each<lb/> development finance activity whether or not it targets environmental objectives. There are four Rio<lb/> markers, covering: biodiversity, desertification, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation.<lb/> A scoring system of three values is used, in which official development finance activities reported to the<lb/> DAC CRS are screened and &quot; marked &quot; as either (i) targeting the conventions as a &quot; principal &quot; objective or<lb/> (ii) as a &quot; significant &quot; objective, or (iii) not targeting the objective. These markers indicate donors&apos; policy<lb/> objectives in relation to each development finance activity. Activities marked as having a &quot; principal &quot;<lb/> objective would not have been funded but for that objective; activities marked &quot; significant &quot; have other<lb/> prime objectives but have been formulated or adjusted to help meet the relevant environmental concerns.<lb/></p>

			<p>The markers provide an indication of the degree of mainstreaming of environmental considerations into<lb/> development co-operation portfolios. In marking the full value of development finance activities the<lb/> markers are considered descriptive rather than strictly quantitative, but allow for an approximate<lb/> quantification of development finance flows that target the Rio convention objectives. In marker data<lb/> presentations the figures for flows targeting objectives as principal or significant can be shown separately<lb/> and the sum referred to as the &quot; total &quot; or &quot; upper bound &quot; of environmental-related development finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Climate change mitigation</head>

			<p>is defined as activities that contribute to the objective of stabilisation of<lb/> greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous<lb/> anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions<lb/> or to enhance GHG sequestration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Climate change adaptation</head>

			<p>is defined as activities that aim to reduce the vulnerability of human or<lb/> natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks, by maintaining or increasing<lb/> adaptive capacity and resilience. This encompasses a range of activities from information and knowledge<lb/> generation, to capacity development, planning and the implementation of climate change adaptation<lb/> actions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Biodiversity is defined as activities that promote at least one of the three objectives of the Convention on<lb/> Biological Diversity: the conservation of biodiversity; sustainable use of its components (ecosystems,<lb/> species or genetic resources); or fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of the utilisation of genetic<lb/> resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>Desertification is defined as activities that aim at combating desertification or mitigating the effects of<lb/> drought in arid, semi-arid or dry sub-humid areas through prevention and/or reduction of land degradation,<lb/> rehabilitation of partly degraded land, or reclamation of desertified land.<lb/></p>

			<p>Environment is defined as activities that are intended to produce an improvement, or something that is<lb/> diagnosed as an improvement, in the physical and/or biological environment of the recipient country, area<lb/> or target group concerned, or activities that include specific action to integrate environmental concerns<lb/> with a range of development objectives through institution building and/or capacity development.<lb/> The Rio markers are applicable to Official Development Assistance (ODA) where reporting is mandatory,<lb/> for the mitigation marker from 2007 flows, and for the adaptation marker since 2010. Reporting is<lb/> voluntary on Other Official Flows (OOF) (i.e. non-concessional developmental flows, excluding export<lb/> credits) starting from 2010.<lb/> A key feature of the marker methodology is that one activity can address several policy objectives at the<lb/> same time. This reflects the fact that the three Rio conventions (targeting global environmental objectives)<lb/> and local environmental objectives are mutually reinforcing, but this overlap poses a problem when<lb/> aggregating data across several markers.<lb/></p>

			<p>The same activity can be marked for e.g. biodiversity and climate change mitigation, or for mitigation and<lb/> adaptation. To avoid double or triple-counting the same activity, aggregate figures for biodiversity-,<lb/> climate change mitigation-, climate change adaptation-and desertification-related aid should not be added<lb/> up. Statistical presentations should either be prepared for one marker at a time, and resulting totals for each<lb/> marker should not be added up – or the overlap should be &quot; treated &quot; . &quot; Treating &quot; the overlap involves<lb/> identifying and deducting the &quot; overlap &quot; , and requires activity-level data.<lb/></p>
