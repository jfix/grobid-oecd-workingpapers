			<p>A well-functioning policy making system is a key pillar of a transparent and effective democratic system.<lb/> It is also a crucial precondition for the country to make progress in the European integration (EI) process<lb/> as the capacity of national administrations to undertake the obligations linked with European Union (EU)<lb/> membership is a key criterion in the assessment of candidate preparedness.<lb/> Although there is no formal acquis in this area, previous experience and ongoing accession processes<lb/> demonstrates that the preparations for EU accession and membership need to be underpinned by policy<lb/> planning, development, co-ordination and implementation arrangements that:<lb/> <lb/> enable consistent policy planning and co-ordination of the Government activities, including<lb/> priority setting;<lb/> <lb/> create polices that are not deficient in substance, are consistent with one another, are<lb/> economically efficient and financially sustainable;<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> include consultation with internal and external stakeholders;<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> ensure that policies are properly implemented, communicated and monitored;<lb/> <lb/> support transposition and implementation of the acquis in all sectors;<lb/> <lb/> lay the foundations for operating effectively as an EU Member State.<lb/></p>

			<p>The requirements for policy planning, development, co-ordination and implementation arrangements<lb/> and capacities need to be enhanced as a country progresses along the path to EI. Kosovo is at a crucial<lb/> stage of the EI process, with negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) started<lb/> in 2013 and formally concluded in July 2014. Entering into the SAA implementation process requires a<lb/> new arrangement for EI structures and transposition of the EU acquis, as well as more efficient policy<lb/> planning and decision making, and higher policy development and implementation capacities.<lb/></p>

			<p>This review is the second in a series of SIGMA policy making reviews, looking into required policy making<lb/> arrangements and the capacities of Kosovo. Covering both the Government and the Assembly, the<lb/> review provides an in-depth analysis of the key aspects of Kosovo&apos;s public governance capacities in policy<lb/> making and co-ordination. On the basis of this analysis, the review suggests how policy making capacities<lb/> may be further enhanced.<lb/> Section one examines Kosovo&apos;s central co-ordination and horizontal planning systems in place, including<lb/> the arrangements for policy analysis and monitoring within line ministries and planning the co-ordination<lb/> of EI affairs. Section two concentrates on policy development procedures and capacities, including<lb/> interministerial consultation, policy analysis and meeting EI requirements. Section 3 analyses the legal<lb/> and institutional framework for parliamentary policy making and examines the Assembly&apos;s performance<lb/> in the exercise of central policy functions, including: legislation, budgeting, executive oversight and<lb/> control, and, as a cross-cutting function, the Assembly&apos;s responsibilities in the process of negotiating SAA<lb/> and the harmonisation of Kosovo&apos;s legal system with EU law.<lb/> This review draws on a range of materials and data collected in 2013, including national legislation,<lb/> central and sectoral planning documents, reports, international and national studies, working documents<lb/> and data collected during the preparation of the study as well as numerous interviews with practitioners<lb/> in the Kosovo administration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy planning and co-ordination in the Government<lb/></head>

			<p>The first part of the review analyses the functioning of the centre of government (CoG) in Kosovo. The<lb/> legal framework for policy planning and co-ordination is broadly in place and does not require any<lb/> substantial changes in the coming years. Key laws and the Government Rules of Procedure (RoP)<lb/> adopted in 2011 are in line with European values and practices, and are very ambitious compared with<lb/> the existing capacities of Kosovo&apos;s administration in terms of what is expected from the policy<lb/> co-ordination bodies and the ministries. The legal framework needed for embedding transposition of the<lb/> acquis into law drafting and policy making practices is in place.<lb/></p>

			<p>The institutions fulfilling the functions of the CoG in Kosovo are the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM),<lb/> the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of European Integration (MEI). Overall, the roles of these<lb/> three organisations are well-established and responsibilities between them are clearly divided in most<lb/> cases. The OPM&apos;s adherence to relevant procedures has led to a stage of maturity, where they are<lb/> broadly followed by all stakeholders. Proper institutional set-up has been created both in the OPM and<lb/> the MEI, and the responsibilities inside the CoG institutions and the ministries are largely respected.<lb/> Therefore, the overall set-up and structure of the central co-ordinating institutions provide a good basic<lb/> level of preparedness for coping with the increasing workload derived from the EI process.<lb/></p>

			<head>Central planning instruments, such as the Government Annual Work Plan (GAWP) and the Action Plan for<lb/></head>

			<p>Stabilisation and Association Agreement (APSAA), are used and are partly consistent with each other and<lb/> with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The ability to plan ahead and include<lb/> implementation costs in forward planning within ministries is still weak. Backlogs due to overburdening<lb/> and unrealistic political expectations exist. Overall planning of the Government&apos;s work is of a rather<lb/> technical nature and different units&apos; efforts inside the CoG are often fragmented and lack co-operation.<lb/> The capacities of all structures to implement an ambitious legal framework are still limited.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, Kosovo should maintain the system&apos;s stability, avoiding major changes in the overall set-up<lb/> and procedures, instead focusing, in the next few years, on steps to strengthen and deepen the<lb/> functioning of the legal and administrative system already in place.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key recommendations<lb/> 1.<lb/> Increase the coherence of planning of the Government&apos;s work and decrease delivery backlogs<lb/></head>

			<p>Short</p>

			<table>-term (1-3 years)<lb/> <lb/> Improve capacities (increase the number of available positions and provide training) of the<lb/> Strategic Planning Office (SPO) of the OPM in the following fields: policy analysis, prioritisation and<lb/> objective setting, development of strategies, and impact assessment.<lb/> <lb/> Translate the Declaration of Priorities (adopted by the Government in April 2014) into concrete<lb/> and coherent sectoral priority measures when preparing the GAWP 2015.<lb/> <lb/> The planning format and process to be streamlined by the MEI, as well as the reporting on various<lb/> EI processes, in particular SAA, visa liberalisation, implementation of the feasibility study priorities.<lb/> <lb/> In co-operation with the SPO and the Government Co-ordination Secretariat (GCS) of the OPM,<lb/> under the co-ordination of the Steering Group for Strategic Planning (SGSP) and using the<lb/> Departments of European Integration and Policy Co-ordination (DEIPCs) in ministries, harmonise<lb/> the development of the GAWP 2015 as well as EI planning documents concerning process and<lb/> priorities 1 .<lb/></table>

			<p><lb/> Under the co-ordination of the SGSP, ensure that SAA negotiation commitments are integrated<lb/> into EI and domestic planning documents, in particular the GAWP and the MTEF.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Firmly apply planning criteria to ensure the annual backlog carried into the coming year of<lb/> strategies to be adopted decreases considerably:<lb/> a) When preparing the four-year Government Programme for the new Government and the<lb/> GAWP Plan 2015, introduce a rule where only sectoral strategies can be included in the annual<lb/> plan of strategic documents. Exemptions from this rule should only be made in specific cases,<lb/> such as EI requirements for a more targeted strategy or other international and domestic<lb/> requirements;<lb/></p>

			<p>b) Gradually move to only sectoral policy strategies being developed by ministries in order to<lb/> consolidate the strategic planning system.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Gradually channel all key EI and national planning and policy co-ordination activities through the<lb/> DEIPCs.<lb/> <lb/> Under the co-ordination of the SGSP, harmonise (and, if possible, merge) reporting on the new<lb/> Government Programme and EI-related strategic plans.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Gradually introduce gradually programme budget elements into the budgetary planning system<lb/> and strengthen both the overall and sectorial prioritisation of the MTEF.<lb/></p>

			<head>Long-term (4-5 years)<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Gradually introduce performance indicators when reporting on key Government strategic<lb/> documents (EI, Declaration of Priorities and Government Programme).<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Incorporate overall and sectoral performance indicators in the Government Programme and the<lb/> GAWP during the next election cycle or change of coalition.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Define monitoring of the implementation of sectorial strategies as a clear task for the SPO of the<lb/> OPM, launch a reporting system to the Government on the implementation of sectoral strategies<lb/> as an integrated part of the GAWP and introduce regular outcome based reporting on the<lb/> implementation of the MTEF.<lb/> <lb/> Merge sectoral strategies with ministries&apos; development strategies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy development in the ministries<lb/></head>

			<p>This part of the review analyses the policy development arrangements and capacities of Kosovo,<lb/> including planning for implementing EI activities and transposing the acquis. Similarly to policy planning<lb/> and co-ordination, the legal framework for policy development is in</p>

			<table>place and sets ambitious standards<lb/> for the CoG institutions and ministries. Capacities of all structures to implement the ambitious legal<lb/> framework are limited.<lb/> Procedures are followed by the ministries, but the whole process has a technical and formal nature.<lb/> Interministerial consultation processes and policy analysis are at the first stages of development, where<lb/> formal requirements are mostly met but the level of actual policy discussion is modest. The system of<lb/> concept papers has been launched which, if implemented rigorously, would be a remarkable<lb/> contribution to strengthening policy analysis. Initiatives of the involved CoG institutions (the Legal<lb/> Department and Government Co-ordination Department of the OPM and the Ministry of Finance) to<lb/> improve the system are not always well co-ordinated.<lb/></table>

			<p>There is room to improve policy development structures and procedures in the ministries. Responsibility<lb/> for policy development is not clear and the share of staff in the departments dealing with policy<lb/> development is low. The acquis transposition process introduced requires tables of concordance. The<lb/> capacity of the ministries in law approximation is understandably low and should be increased gradually.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ministries have generally launched co-ordinating structures to deal with EI co-ordination, strategic<lb/> planning and policy development. This is to be commended. However, these structures need to be<lb/> enhanced as these units&apos; capacity to deliver is hampered, mostly due to a lack of standing in one<lb/> ministry, a shortage of staff or lack of skills and expertise. However, some promising champions, such as<lb/> the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), seem to be emerging already.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key recommendations<lb/> 1.<lb/> Increase the capacity of the CoG to co-ordinate and the ministries to develop<lb/> and implement policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Short</p>

			<table>-term (1-3 years)<lb/> <lb/> Improve the quality of concept papers by increasing the capacities for quality control and provision<lb/> of day-to-day guidance of the CoG institutions responsible for policy and legal development and<lb/> fiscal analysis.<lb/> <lb/> Consider adjustments in the Government sessions to enable more active and timely involvement<lb/> of the Council of General Secretaries in the preparatory process.<lb/> <lb/> Strengthen the Council of General Secretaries&apos; role in the Government decision making process as<lb/> a main body for handling interministerial disputes, as well as discussing and deciding on horizontal<lb/> issues.<lb/> <lb/> Review how new principles introduced by the Government RoP in late 2011 have contributed to<lb/> improving the quality of policy discussions, and review how interministerial dialogue takes place<lb/> between ministries and the central government. Consider the results and implement any<lb/> necessary changes.<lb/> <lb/> Increase, through training and reallocation of staff, policy analysis capacities of the OPM&apos;s key<lb/> departments providing more comprehensive analytical advice to the Government and more active<lb/> steering of ministerial inputs.<lb/> <lb/> Define a coherent joint approach by CoG institutions to the improvement of policy development<lb/> instruments and capacities, such as financial impact assessments (FIAs), cost evaluations of new<lb/> policies, concept papers, etc.<lb/> <lb/> Strengthen the capability of line ministry staff to fully account for implementation issues and<lb/> potential financial impacts when developing policies, strategies and drafting legislation.<lb/> <lb/> Develop the capability of line ministries to properly integrate non-governmental organisations<lb/> (NGOs) and the public into the policy making process by providing written guidance and training<lb/> on consultation methods.<lb/> <lb/> Launch a policy planning and strategy development capacity building programme for functional<lb/> and policy departments starting with DEIPCs, legal departments and key policy development<lb/> departments in the ministries mainly responsible for meeting requirements in the EI process,<lb/> namely MTI, Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), Ministry of Justice (MJ) and the Ministry of<lb/> Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development (MAFRD). This programme can then be gradually<lb/> extended to policy departments in all ministries.<lb/> <lb/> Analyse the internal policy development processes of the ministries to more clearly define the<lb/> responsibilities of key departments and management levels in policy development. Find ways to<lb/> strengthen the policy development departments.<lb/></table>

			<head>Long-term (4-5 years)<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Build on the fiscal impact assessment process and introduce a wider process of policy analysis that<lb/> evaluates a full range of costs and benefits and wider issues, such as potential environmental and<lb/> social impacts.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Launch an ex-post evaluation of policy initiatives and laws to review whether, once implemented<lb/> they are achieving the original objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Root created mechanisms and develop capacities for effective transposition of the EU acquis<lb/> Short-term (1-3 years)<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Gradually enforce the adopted regulatory and normative acts which establish a framework for the<lb/> application of tables of concordance and clarify the division of labour of different departments and<lb/> authorities involved.<lb/> <lb/> Enhance the capacity of the ministries&apos; EI departments through staff evaluation, recruitment and<lb/> training to better implement the new SAA-related processes, and tasks related to the tables of<lb/> concordance. Ensure that all staff in EI departments have sufficient English skills and at least one<lb/> lawyer in key ministries has adequate knowledge of the relevant acquis. In allocating resources for<lb/> staff increases, prioritise those ministries that deal with a greater burden, such as the MTI,<lb/> Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), MIA foremost, and the MoF, Ministry of<lb/> Infrastructure (MI) and MAFRD secondly.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Enhance the MEI&apos;s co-ordination capabilities through better political prioritisation of actions and<lb/> by giving priority to the SAA process and imposing stringent criteria for including new actions in<lb/> the framework planning documents. At the same time, allow ministries some flexibility in deciding<lb/> the timeframes for delivery of objectives. This would enable the MEI to lead the process in a more<lb/> systematic and targeted way and reduce backlogs.<lb/> <lb/> Review the functioning of the co-ordination system with a view to streamlining the reporting and<lb/> planning mechanisms in a more unified system and ensuring a smooth transition from SAA and<lb/> EPAP parallel structures to a unified co-ordination structure.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Increase the budgetary planning capacities of the ministries and ensure that the procedures that<lb/> enhance forward budgetary planning (including concept papers and financial impact analyses) are<lb/> rigorously applied through all stages of the EI process.<lb/> <lb/> Strengthen the co-operation between the LO and the MEI and consider adopting the policy of<lb/> issuing joint legal opinions (at least for pivotal EI-related acts) to avoid giving conflicting signals to<lb/> ministries and ensure the homogeneity of legal oversight.<lb/></p>

			<head>Long-term (4-5 years)<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Move towards a central single EI planning framework which would set clear and measurable<lb/> quantitative or qualitative targets to assess progress.<lb/> <lb/> If the EI process progresses to a more advanced phase (i.e. accession negotiations), re-address the<lb/> issue of how to involve the majority of cabinet members in the substantial preparatory political<lb/> discussions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy making in Parliament<lb/></head>

			<p>The basic political and administrative structures of the Assembly are in place, in particular rules and<lb/> regulations, and processes at political and administrative levels to plan the Assembly&apos;s work and carry<lb/> out its main functions. However, the parliamentary policy making role in Kosovo is especially challenged<lb/> in at least two ways.<lb/> First, the legal system is still in the process of maturing, so that many aspects of economic and social life,<lb/> in particular, continue to await regulation through detailed parliamentary legislation. Between the end of<lb/> March 2011, at the beginning of the IVth Assembly, and June 2013, i.e. within a little more than two<lb/> years, the Assembly approved 164 laws, the majority of them being completely new laws rather than<lb/> amended legislation 2 . There are, accordingly, great pressures on the legislative capacity of the Assembly,<lb/> and there is a concomitant danger that other parliamentary business, notably oversight and control, may<lb/> become marginalised.<lb/> Second, there is, on the one hand, a strict institutional separation between the Government and the<lb/> Assembly, most visible in the constitutional provision that prohibits members of the Government to hold<lb/> an Assembly mandate. The emphasis on separation raises problems of effective executive-legislative<lb/> co-operation. On the other hand, in some important respects, notably when it comes to its own budget<lb/> and personnel, the Assembly is constrained by a lack of autonomy from the Government.<lb/> Regarding EU integration, the Standing Committee for EI has been given extensive responsibilities under<lb/> the Assembly&apos;s RoP, with a special focus on the review and supervision of &quot; the process of harmonisation<lb/> of laws enacted by the Assembly with the legislation of the EU &quot; . Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive<lb/> legal framework governing the powers and responsibilities of the Assembly in the EU integration process,<lb/> and the Committee&apos;s role is geared towards review and co-ordination rather than the introduction and<lb/> formulation of initiatives or detailed legislative scrutiny and amendment.<lb/> The IVth Assembly shows major improvements in parliamentary policy making capacity, whilst there is<lb/> awareness at both the political and administrative levels of the Assembly that further organisational<lb/> development is required. The options for change briefly highlighted in this section focus on major<lb/> organisational questions that affect both political and administrative structures and processes.<lb/></p>

			<table>Key recommendations<lb/> 1.<lb/> Increase capacity of the Assembly through improving functionality division of the Committees,<lb/> strengthening the legal framework and increasing its independence.<lb/> Short-term (1-3 years)<lb/> <lb/> Open meetings of the Presidency to a representative of the Government charged with handling<lb/> executive-legislative relations to improve the co-ordination of work between the Government and<lb/> the Assembly. Such a representative should not, have voting rights but should act as a source of<lb/> information, allow the Presidency to express concerns about the flow of legislative business<lb/> coming from the Government and act as an interlocutor when it comes to handling complaints<lb/> about unanswered parliamentary questions.<lb/> <lb/> Review the functionality of the division of labour between the Committee for European<lb/> Integration and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and between the Committee for European<lb/> Integration and the Committee of Legislation. It is worth exploring a structure in which all political<lb/> aspects of integration are dealt with in a Committee for European and Foreign Affairs, whilst<lb/> questions of compliance and harmonisation are dealt with in a Committee for Legislation and<lb/> Harmonisation.<lb/></table>

			<p><lb/> Reconsider the legal status of Assembly personnel. It is not, at this stage, self-evident that there is<lb/> a need for a law regulating the civil service status of Assembly staff, but there is a strong a case for<lb/> supplementary regulations that do justice to the special conditions in the Assembly.<lb/> <lb/> Reconsider the legal framework governing Assembly personnel policy and the administration of its<lb/> budget to reduce dependency from the MoF and the Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) staff<lb/> recruitment and budgeting processes.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Create a comprehensive legal framework that sets out how the Executive and the Assembly<lb/> co-operate in the area of EI. Such a framework needs to set out, in particular:<lb/> o the rights of the Assembly to information in EU-related matters and the informational duties<lb/> of the Executive (i.e. the types of information provided by the Executive, the timing of<lb/> information to be made available, the parliamentary procedures for processing the<lb/> information and the parliamentary rights for probing the information);<lb/> o the rights to discuss and adopt parliamentary positions on the matters concerned, such as<lb/> negotiation mandates;<lb/> o the obligations on the part of the Executive to take parliamentary positions into account;<lb/> o the rules and procedures for direct contacts between the Assembly and EU institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> In line with evolving practices in EU Member States, consider introducing additional oversight and<lb/> control instruments that are principally geared to enhancing institutional and policy performance.<lb/> As concrete tools:<lb/> o Foresee regular performance reviews in new sectoral legislation, so that evaluation and<lb/> assessment are enshrined in legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>o</head>

			<p>Create additional instruments that allow Deputies to solicit information from the Government,<lb/> notably extended written questions to be answered by the Government or individual<lb/> ministries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Long term (4-5 years)<lb/></head>

			<p><lb/> Analyse the consequences of the structural reform of the Assembly once the new structure has<lb/> had a chance to settle down, and its effects on the performance of the Assembly administration<lb/> can be assessed more systematically.<lb/></p>

			<p><lb/> Encourage flexibility in the allocation of staff resources across functions, not least in response to<lb/> the uneven flow of parliamentary business during the year.<lb/> <lb/> Since it might not be possible to increase the overall number of staff servicing committees, enable<lb/> the sharing of staff across them. The allocation of scarce staff resources must be driven by the<lb/> identification of the key political functions performed by the Assembly, i.e. it must be led by<lb/> demand.<lb/> <lb/> After analysing the impacts of conducted reforms and exhausting effects provided by flexibility<lb/> measures, move towards larger and more cohesive departments.<lb/></p>

			<head>1<lb/> POLICY PLANNING AND CO-ORDINATION IN THE</head>

			<table>GOVERNMENT<lb/> 1.1<lb/> Legal framework<lb/> The main elements of the legal framework include: organic budget law 3 ; the Law on State<lb/> Administration 4 ; and the Regulation of Rules and Procedure of the Government 5 . The legal framework<lb/> specifies the responsibilities of the OPM, provides authority to assume these responsibilities, and creates<lb/> a framework for co-ordinating activities between key institutions at the centre of government, namely<lb/> the OPM, the MEI and the MoF.<lb/> The general EI-related legal framework consists of the Government Decision No. 6/121 of 22 April 2010,<lb/> Regulation No. 07/2010, and Regulation No. 32/2012, which established the MEI, created (and later<lb/> amended) its internal structures and adopted interministerial structures for the EI process. With its latest<lb/> EI-related decision, the Government has established the SAA negotiation structures. These acts empower<lb/> the MEI to lead the EI process by initiating and driving the planning process (including Instrument for<lb/> Pre-Accession [IPA] resources); monitoring the implementation activities (including the quality of<lb/> harmonisation of the acquis); and reporting on the progress made. Government Regulation No. 01/2011<lb/> also established specialised EI departments (Departments for European Integration and Policy<lb/> Co-ordination – DEIPC) within all line ministries.<lb/></table>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The legal framework is substantially complete and of generally high quality. It provides a good basis for<lb/> the management of all aspects of the policy process, including planning and monitoring, policy<lb/> development, policy co-ordination, and decision making.<lb/></p>

			<p>The legal framework clearly defines and divides the responsibilities between the OPM, the MEI and the<lb/> MoF. In the SIGMA interviews conducted for the purpose of this review, all counterparts confirmed that<lb/> informal co-operation and information exchange among the three government bodies is smooth.<lb/></p>

			<p>The legal framework provides a transparent mechanism for conducting EI processes and, in a rather<lb/> detailed manner, also defines all the specific tasks and obligations of the different parties involved. The<lb/> empowerment of the institutions that fulfil leading roles in the EI process (MEI in particular) fits well<lb/> within the overall and system of governance architecture in Kosovo.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2<lb/> Planning the work of the Government<lb/></head>

			<p>The legislative framework stipulates four central planning documents: the GAWP, the APSAA 6 , the MTEF<lb/> and Medium Term Declaration of Priorities (DP). Three of these (the APSAA, the MTEF and the</p>

			<table>DP) have<lb/> a medium-term planning dimension.<lb/> 3<lb/> Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability (17 December 2003).<lb/> 4<lb/> Law No.03/L – 189 on the State Administration of Kosovo (16 September 2010).<lb/> 5<lb/> Regulation on RoP of Kosovo, No. 09/2011.<lb/> 6<lb/> The APSAA replaced the EPAP in late 2012.<lb/> According to Article 47 of the Government RoP, the Government approves by the end of December of<lb/> each year a Government Work Plan for the following calendar year. The plan is prepared in accordance<lb/> with the guidelines and instructions issued by the OPM and it is considered to be the principal planning<lb/> and implementation document of the Government.<lb/> The GAWP covers both legislative and non-legislative matters, as well as the preparation and<lb/> implementation of strategies. The legislative tasks and commitments for developing strategies are<lb/> summarised annually in separate annexes to the work plan. The GAWP includes a prioritisation<lb/> mechanism consisting of two sections: section A concentrates on activities needed for the<lb/> implementation of the strategic priorities, and section B encompasses all activities of ministries.<lb/> Regulations define mechanisms for ensuring coherence among central planning documents. Every item<lb/> foreseen under the GAWP has to make reference to other planning documents, such as the Government<lb/> Statement of Priorities, the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Economic Vision and the MTEF.<lb/> The RoP are in place to link policy planning with annual and medium-term financial planning, although<lb/> they are implemented with varying degrees of success, mainly through the strategic objectives. 7<lb/> However, there are also requirements to link the GAWP to budget decisions and to include projected<lb/> costs. In addition, the RoP specify the responsibility of ministries to provide the calculation of public<lb/> revenues and expenditures for new initiatives. Fundamental to this is the requirement that the MoF<lb/> reviews and approves the fiscal analysis 8 .<lb/> Requirements exist for linking the GAWP with the EI process. The guidelines on the preparation of the<lb/> GAWP foresee a &apos;reference to EPAP/APSAA.&apos; Moreover, Article 48 of the RoP expects the GCS of the<lb/> OPM to co-ordinate the preparation of the GAWP with the MEI.<lb/> The RoP of the Government obliges the SPO and the GCS to issue general guidelines to enable better<lb/> planning and more detailed guidance of the methodology for the GAWP, including strategies and a<lb/> legislative programme 9 . Guidance materials are also provided by the MEI to support the preparation and<lb/> monitoring of the APSAA.<lb/></table>

			<p>The reporting and monitoring system is embedded in the legal framework. Ministries have to transmit<lb/> data to the GCS quarterly for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the GAWP, including data<lb/> on the extent to which each activity has been achieved, whether the deadline has been met, and an<lb/> assessment of any problems encountered in the implementation and recommendations for remedial<lb/> action. Any recommendations for amendments to the work plan can be submitted for approval to the<lb/> Government sessions.

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Kosovo&apos;s legislation provides a solid framework for ensuring the coherence of the Government&apos;s central<lb/> planning documents and enabling linkages between the GAWP and the work plans needed for EI and the<lb/> budgetary process. The overall structure of the GAWP, including a section for priority activities and<lb/> annexed plans for legislation and strategies, enables efficient planning of the work of the Government.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.1<lb/> The Government decision making process<lb/></head>

			<p>The Government&apos;s decision making procedures and requirements are defined mainly in the RoP, adopted<lb/> in late 2011. The RoP regulates in detail the process of preparing meetings of the Government (including<lb/> the responsibilities of various co-ordinating offices of the OPM and the MEI, the MJ and the MoF), as well<lb/> as the organisational aspects of the meetings. The RoP also regulates the decision making procedures of<lb/> the Government. Compared to the previous RoP, there is now a stronger emphasis on policy<lb/> development and policy analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>The RoP clearly specifies the documents that must be presented to support items on which the<lb/> Government must make a decision at Government meetings. In addition to the explanatory<lb/> memorandum, a concept paper (policy paper) should accompany a policy proposal or a draft law. A fiscal<lb/> impact assessment is also required, and it must adhere to the template provided by the MoF.<lb/></p>

			<p>The requirement of a policy paper to be submitted for Government discussion prior to legal drafting for<lb/> all proposals, except those of a minor nature, is a new principle in the RoP of 2011. To allow the<lb/> Government to make informed decisions, ministries have to send policy analysis that includes the<lb/> consideration of different options and their consequences 11 . This policy analysis must be prepared in the<lb/> format of a concept paper.<lb/> bodies), and is responsible for preparing the work of the MCEI and running routine monitoring of the<lb/> implementation work. Under the working committee, the system relies on seven sectoral executive<lb/> committees, which consist of experts from ministries and are tasked with preparing the EPAP plans and<lb/> implementing the commitments taken. All three co-ordination forums – the MCEI, WCEI and executive<lb/> committees – were initially dedicated to the co-ordination of tasks deriving from Kosovo&apos;s aim to deepen<lb/> its integration with the EU.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the launch of the stabilisation and association process, a new set of co-ordinating layers were<lb/> established in early 2013, such as the position of Chief Negotiator (ex officio MEI minister) and the<lb/> Negotiation Team at ministerial level to prepare negotiation positions and commitments. The decision<lb/> also established the post of Negotiating Team Secretary (Secretary-General of MEI) and created three<lb/> SAA Negotiation Working Groups to prepare and conduct negotiations at the technical level, two of<lb/> which (legal approximation and co-operation policies) are headed by MEI, and one (trade issues) by the<lb/> MTI.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>A proper procedural framework for Government decision making and policy development has been<lb/> created by the OPM, the MEI and the MoF. The specific regulations – especially the Government RoP –<lb/> are highly sophisticated and hence establish an ambitious benchmark for the existing capacities of<lb/> Kosovo&apos;s administration in terms of what is expected from the CoG bodies and ministries. However, this<lb/> provides a good model to strive towards.<lb/></p>

			<p>The procedural aspects of policy analysis and policy development still require attention, especially<lb/> concerning handling and steering policy analysis issues, in particular concept papers, at the CoG.<lb/> Responsibility for co-ordinating policy development and policy analysis is not precisely established in the<lb/> legislation. This has led to a situation where MoF deals with the financial issues of concept papers, and<lb/> the LO, the SPO and the GCS all are involved in processing and providing feedback on concept papers.<lb/> Responsibility for development of the system and guiding ministries is scattered.<lb/></p>

			<p>The legal framework for EI is in place and is sufficient for a country which is in the phase of starting SAA<lb/> negotiations. As some key elements have been introduced only recently and there is no widespread<lb/> implementation practice, the legal framework might merit additional fine tuning after the SAA<lb/> negotiations have been finalised. For example, although the normative acts needed for embedding and<lb/> transposing the acquis into law drafting and policy making practices have been adopted, they have been<lb/> used in practice in only a few cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>The crucial issue at the CoG level is to ensure the MEI&apos;s role in monitoring that the draft bills related to<lb/> the EU acquis conform with the general legal framework, which gives the tasks of legislative<lb/> co-ordination and oversight to the LO of the OPM. The RoP of the Government (Article 42) give the LO<lb/> quite a broad mandate not only in ensuring the overall co-ordination of legislative drafting of all draft<lb/> laws that the Government submits to the Assembly, but also in empowering the LO to ensure (through<lb/> instructions and assistance) that the drafts the ministries submit adhere to the overall legal framework of<lb/> Kosovo and follow the overall standards and quality of legislative drafting.<lb/> This means that the MEI and the OPM should work closely together to ensure full compatibility between<lb/> Kosovo&apos;s legal order and that of the EU. Although this co-operation already exists at the informal level<lb/> and the working relationship is described by both sides as &apos;cordial&apos;, further steps could be taken to<lb/> formalise this relationship at the procedural level. As the integration process advances, the transposition<lb/> effort will increasingly penetrate all policy fields and every facet of legal order. To ensure that the<lb/> transposing acts adhere to a single legal logic which takes into account the aims of the acquis, as well as<lb/> what is viable within Kosovo&apos;s own legal order, the two bodies could issue joint legal opinions to the<lb/> ministries on EI-related acts. This would also avoid having the two &apos;overseers&apos; issuing contradictory<lb/> opinions to line ministries.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3<lb/> Policy co-ordination and planning arrangements at the centre of the government (CoG)<lb/> 1.3.1<lb/> Coherence of the CoG<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall policy co-ordination and planning issues are regulated in the RoP. Responsibilities and functions<lb/> of the CoG institutions are stipulated in regulations on internal organisations. The regulation for the OPM<lb/> manages the structure and mandate of each office within the OPM 13 . The regulations of the MEI and the<lb/> MoF also determine their competence on policy making issues. The MEI has the authority to co-ordinate<lb/> composition and implementation of strategic documents relevant for EI, handle daily EI-related<lb/> co-ordination issues, and check the compatibility of legislation with the EU acquis. The MoF has the<lb/> competence to lead medium-term and annual budgetary processes and reviews and approve the FIAs of<lb/> primary and secondary legislation and strategic documents.<lb/></p>

			<p>Existing co-operation of CoG institutions was formalised in June 2012 with the creation of the SGSP 14 .<lb/> The group is led by the political adviser of the Prime Minister and assembles key officials from the OPM<lb/> (directors of three key departments), the MoF (directors of budget and macroeconomic departments),<lb/> the MEI (director of the EU assistance co-ordination department) and the MPA (director of public<lb/> administration reform co-ordination). The Group&apos;s functions include establishing coherence of key<lb/> Government strategic documents, taking into account the EI process priorities, harmonising budget and<lb/> policy planning, as well as ensuring realistic planning and streamlining of foreign aid with Government<lb/> priorities. Thus the SGSP is primarily co-ordinating planning issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main co-ordination forums for daily policy issues at the CoG are handled through informal regular<lb/> meetings of the Deputy Prime Ministers (DPMs) and formal weekly meetings of State Secretaries. In<lb/> 2013, the number of DPMs was extended from five to six 15 . The horizontal responsibilities of the DPMs<lb/> are legally fixed with the regulation on internal organisation of the OPM; the specific areas for which the<lb/> DPMs are responsible are established through the informal distribution of functions. The PM holds<lb/> meetings with the DPMs and the Secretary-General of the OPM twice a week.<lb/></p>

			<p>At administrative level co-ordination is formalised. The responsibilities of the weekly meetings of General<lb/> Secretaries are set out clearly in the RoP 16 , covering consideration of items submitted to the Government<lb/> sessions, discussion on the agenda for Government sessions, follow-up to implementation of the<lb/> Government Annual Work Plan, and review of the EI process. The RoP also mandates the Council of<lb/> General Secretaries to solve conflicting and unresolved issues between ministries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The institutional architecture for carrying out policy development, co-ordination and planning functions<lb/> at the CoG is in place. The CoG comprises multiple institutions but many are based within the Prime<lb/> Minister&apos;s Office, making co-ordination easier. There is clarity at the administrative level about the<lb/> respective roles of institutions and established procedures for co-operation and co-ordination among<lb/> them.<lb/> 13<lb/></p>

			<p>A draft new regulation on internal systematisation of the OPM has been prepared, but was not yet approved<lb/> by the Government at the time of compiling this review.<lb/> Co-ordination forums contribute to policy planning. The composition of the SGSP is adequate, and the<lb/> definition of its functions sufficient to ensure a harmonised and efficient strategic planning system.<lb/> However, additional efforts by all counterparts should be made to fully exploit the benefits of the SGSP<lb/> and assure its sustainable and effective functioning. Since its formal creation, the SGSP has met only<lb/> three times and has not been the joint decision making centre in relevant strategic planning processes.<lb/> The planning and implementation of key processes (EI, public administration reform (PAR), the review of<lb/> the legislative programme) are regular weekly items on the agenda of the Council of General Secretaries,<lb/> which creates a good basis for whole-of-government planning and enables discussions of key<lb/> implementation challenges.<lb/></p>

			<p>Regular preparatory discussions of the Government session agenda items by the Council of General<lb/> Secretaries has the potential to efficiently address contentious issues of the ministries before the<lb/> sessions. However, developing the capacity and tradition of dealing with these issues effectively takes<lb/> time: analysis of minutes of the Council meetings demonstrates that the emphasis of discussions is<lb/> currently on providing an overview by the OPM of items included in the agenda. On very few occasions<lb/> were contentious issues actually raised by the ministries.<lb/></p>

			<p>With six Deputy Prime Ministers, political-level co-ordination is a challenging task. However, clear,<lb/> informal mandates of the DPMs and informal working processes created for preparing decisions of the<lb/> Government, are meeting the challenge relatively well 17 .<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2<lb/> Structure of the OPM<lb/></head>

			<p>The OPM has over 15 departments fulfilling functions set by government regulation on the internal<lb/> organisation of the OPM and in some cases (e.g. the Office of the Co-ordinator of the Strategy of the<lb/> North of Kosovo) by specific law. Also, the number of the central state administration bodies reporting to<lb/> the OPM was extended to six with the new regulation on internal organisation of the OPM 18 . The key<lb/> departments for policy making and co-ordination are the GCS, the SPO and the LO, but also the Public<lb/> Communication Office (PCO) is involved in the Government decision making process. Directors of these<lb/> departments are well connected to the relevant policy co-ordination forums (they all are members of the<lb/> Council of General Secretaries) and with the Prime Minister&apos;s advisers. The SPO has a direct<lb/> subordination to the Prime Minister, being at the same time accountable for administrative issues to the<lb/> General Secretary. Other key departments are accountable to the General Secretary. Each key<lb/> department runs its own co-ordination network in the ministries; these networks contribute, among<lb/> other things, to the preparation of Government sessions. Responsibilities of the key departments are<lb/> defined in the RoP.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Internal co-ordination within the central government works well. The system has reached the stage of<lb/> maturity where each department knows its responsibilities in fulfilling one of the core functions of the<lb/> OPM – planning the work of the Government and handling Government sessions – and is capable of<lb/> providing quality outcomes flexibly and within tight timeframes. The OPM has leverage in relation to the<lb/> ministries and has been able to set-up procedures which are followed by all stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<p>Remaining challenges are related to the rather fragmented and cumbersome structure of the OPM,<lb/> some grey areas between the key departments and the capacity of key structures to meet with high<lb/> quality all responsibilities established by the RoP.<lb/></p>

			<p>The OPM comprises various departments with very different tasks, for example the Office for issues of<lb/> Categories Deriving from the Kosovo Liberation Army War. Agencies under its supervision also cover a<lb/> broad range of areas, for example the Veterinary and Food Agency. This is a legacy from the<lb/> pre-independence era, and it would be useful for Kosovo to continue the process of transferring some of<lb/> these functions to relevant ministries.<lb/> Supporting departments and key departments for policy co-ordination and government decision making<lb/> are accountable to the General Secretary, others to the Prime Minister&apos;s Cabinet. A high number of<lb/> rather small departments with a wide scope of functions requires substantial management from the PM<lb/> Cabinet staff and the General Secretary, and makes the design and implementation of coherent strategy<lb/> for the whole organisation, as well as daily management, challenging.<lb/></p>

			<p>The number of staff in key departments is modest compared with the overall size of the OPM. According<lb/> to the draft regulation on internal organisation, the SPO has 5 positions, the GCS 12, the LO 11 and the<lb/> Communication Office 6, but not all of these are filled. Staffing issues are particularly challenging for the<lb/> SPO. This creates some capacity issues in fulfilling all the responsibilities envisioned by the RoP, in<lb/> particular in setting priorities, planning in substance the work of the Government and providing<lb/> analytical support to the PM and the Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>As per normal practice, all main departments are involved in the key processes of the OPM: policy<lb/> planning and co-ordinating government decision making. Responsibilities established by the RoP do not<lb/> exclude overlaps between departments, particularly concerning analytical tasks and handling materials<lb/> submitted to the Government sessions. In practice, however, no remarkable duplications exist due to the<lb/> limited capacity of departments. At the same time, the arrangement of each department looking at<lb/> submitted documents from its own perspective has led to some key processes having many contributors,<lb/> creating co-ordination challenges. A good example is concept papers where the formal responsibility of<lb/> the GCS for ensuring their overall quality could be supported by a much stronger co-ordination role in<lb/> practice, including commenting on substance, co-ordinating inputs and activities of the CoG actors, and<lb/> guiding ministries towards higher quality materials.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.3<lb/> The MEI and co-ordination structures for EI<lb/></head>

			<p>Recent organisational changes, prompted by the new systematisation, have been introduced within the<lb/> MEI. These were steps in the right direction and, overall, the MEI&apos;s internal structures and development<lb/> plans accommodate the new challenges of the process 19 . In addition to the departments that lead the<lb/> planning, monitoring and co-ordination efforts of the EI process 20 , the MEI has a separate unit to oversee<lb/> the harmonisation effort (Department of EU law) as well as a new, separate unit for co-ordinating donor<lb/> assistance. It is important to note that the MEI has, since the start of 2013, introduced formal practices<lb/> to foster interdepartmental co-operation, especially between the EU law department and other<lb/> functional departments (including the department dealing with IPA). The EU law department now<lb/> participates in preparatory meetings when IPA assistance and SAA Action Plans are discussed and, in<lb/> return, the EU law department involves the functional departments in the formulation of its legal opinion<lb/> once the ministries submit draft EI-related laws.<lb/> As indicated above, with the launch of the SAA process, a second layer to the interministerial<lb/> co-ordination mechanisms was introduced with the establishment of the Negotiation Team and the<lb/> Working Groups for SAA negotiations. The Negotiation Team is chaired by the Minister for the MEI and<lb/> consists of ministers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the MAFRD, the MoF, the MTI, the<lb/> Ministry of Economic Development (MED), and the MJ.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to these co-ordination layers, the MEI also administered an EI Task Force, a broad forum<lb/> consisting of representatives from the administration, NGOs, academia and interest groups, brought<lb/> together to draft a new national EI strategy, which was adopted by the National EI Council on 7 October<lb/> 2013. The strategy is a framework document which aims to solidify a broader national consensus around<lb/> EI goals, which could then facilitate compromises on important, specific EI-related reforms. It deals with<lb/> five topics: 1) effective governance, 2) the rule of law and the fight against organised crime, 3) economic<lb/> growth, 4) the enhanced involvement of stakeholders and 5) regional co-operation and development. It<lb/> does not address the operational side of EI, which is left to the GAWP and the SAA Action Plan.<lb/> As the Task Force was an ad hoc mechanism with the sole purpose of drafting the strategy, the MEI has<lb/> no plans to continue with it and therefore it will be abandoned. However, the National EI Council<lb/> convened by the President of Kosovo, which sees itself as a consensus-building platform and which<lb/> complements to some extent the Parliament&apos;s EU committee, will continue. Its secretariat consists of<lb/> two members from the President&apos;s Office and one member from the MEI. Its discussions normally<lb/> focussed on major specific policy areas or reforms (such as PAR), to discuss and assess progress and<lb/> problems involved. With the adoption of the national EI strategy, there are plans for the</p>

			<table>National Council<lb/> 19<lb/> The reform of organisational structures took into account analysis and recommendations made by the GIZ.<lb/> See Engelman, Andrej (May 2012), &quot; Strengthening of the European Integration Process and Structures &quot; ;<lb/> Support to the European Integration Process in Kosovo, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale<lb/> Zusammenarbeit GmbH.<lb/> to monitor, perhaps once a year, progress in implementing the national EI strategy and to use the MEI<lb/> and the established co-ordination mechanisms (such as the WCEI) as implementing and reporting<lb/> channels. As the National Council does not directly influence operational policy planning and neither are<lb/> they part of the operational co-ordination system of the executive, it will not be considered in the<lb/> functional analyses of the co-ordination system.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Figure 1. General architecture of Kosovo&apos;s EI co-ordination system<lb/> Source: MEI.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The co-ordination system has all the necessary arrangements at the political, higher administrative and<lb/> expert level, which should ensure the proper leadership, planning, monitoring and reporting functions<lb/> necessary for Kosovo in its current stage of the EI process (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The co-ordination system is<lb/> relatively well equipped to set enforceable deadlines and to monitor and report on the progress made.<lb/> However, the potential of interministerial co-ordination mechanisms is not fully exploited as both MCEI<lb/> and WCEI function mainly as reporting mechanisms on the progress of commitments and forums of<lb/> information exchange regarding the reasons for these problems and delays. This pattern is also followed<lb/> in the other interministerial forums established for more specific tasks. The assessment of interviewees<lb/> is that both administrative and political level forums give little input into policy or decision making<lb/> processes (for example, providing decision makers with real alternative policy choices, or solving<lb/> technical-level disputes). There is some evidence which indicates that the situation is gradually changing<lb/> and these forums (Trade Council, WCEI) are more often used also as decision making and<lb/> problem-solving bodies. Feasibility study short-term and medium-term benchmarks and SAA<lb/> negotiations are a good trigger for more substantive discussions on problematic issues, which indicates<lb/> that when the EI agenda advances, the nature of the discussions changes and interministerial forums<lb/> have good potential to develop into interministerial decision making centres.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of the functioning logic of the system, one can make a distinction between the interministerial<lb/> mechanisms adopted at the political, higher-administrative and expert levels. On the other hand, the<lb/> system is also divided between two functional work processes: the new SAA process and the old EPAP<lb/> and more general EI process. In this context, three issues can be outlined.<lb/> First, the coherency of the system is guaranteed mainly through the MEI, which functions as the central<lb/> co-ordinator between the different levels (expert to political) and two functional pillars (SAA and EPAP).<lb/> The fact that MEI&apos;s role has been strengthened should be commended.<lb/> Second, at the political level, the role of the Minister for European Integration is crucial to ensure the link<lb/> with the PM and the Cabinet. This gives the process the necessary political leadership and clout, which<lb/> are useful for prioritisation, as well as the appropriate arbitration tools to solve conflicts. In the future<lb/> development of the system, great care should be taken to maintain and strengthen both the institutional<lb/> and non-institutional linkages between the Minister for EI and Head of the Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, at the expert level, the fact that the SAA and EPAP structures are different for the expert groups,<lb/> with different chairs and slightly dissimilar (though to some extent overlapping) membership and<lb/> mandates (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>), raises issues which should be closely followed after the SAA negotiations are<lb/> finished. Knowledge and know-how gained from SAA negotiations needs to be transferred to the<lb/> implementation side.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although SAA-related structures are viewed as ad hoc instruments that will be disbanded once they<lb/> achieve their purpose, this might not be the best course of action. All policy co-ordination mechanisms<lb/> will develop their own working practices and co-operation dynamic, and abolishing ad hoc structures<lb/> once the original mandates are achieved may engender the loss of good practices and co-operation<lb/> methods which could be transferred to the management of other processes in a more permanent<lb/> framework (like the future accession process).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4<lb/> Processes and implementation capacities<lb/> 1.4.1<lb/> Planning the work of the Government<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a clear set of Government priorities (Statement of Priorities), approved by the Government each<lb/> year. The source of the priorities is the Government programme 2011-2014, Plan for implementation of<lb/> Economic Vision 2011-2014 (for economic area), sectorial and sub-sectorial strategies and political<lb/> decisions of the Government. The method of communicating priorities to the ministries is not regulated;<lb/> however, the process is being improved at a practical level each year. Priorities are developed through a<lb/> consultative process, whereby ministries propose priorities for their area of competence. However, the<lb/> final selection of priorities is done by the SGSP and is forwarded to the Government for a decision.<lb/></p>

			<p>The preparation and approval of the Government&apos;s strategic priorities and work programme, and its link<lb/> to the budget, is co-ordinated by the OPM. The development of the Declaration of Priorities, which also<lb/> feeds into the MTEF, is co-ordinated by the SPO of the OPM. Part A of the GAWP is composed of the<lb/> Government priorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Monitoring the implementation of the GAWP is co-ordinated by the GCS; ministries give a progress<lb/> report on a quarterly basis 22 . The information is consolidated into quarterly and annual<lb/> government-wide reports by the GCS and submitted to the Council of General Secretaries. The annual<lb/> report for the implementation of the annual work plan is published and distributed by the GCS during<lb/> the first quarter of the subsequent year.<lb/> Development and monitoring of key operational planning documents for the EI process is co-ordinated<lb/> by the MEI. Until 2012, the key document was the European Partnership Action Plan (EPAP); it was<lb/> replaced at the end of 2012 by the APSAA. The APSAA is targeted to timely implementation of<lb/> commitments derived from the EI process, where reforms needed for SAA are prioritised. Coherence<lb/> between the GAWP and the APSAA is sought by the administration: both documents are adopted by the<lb/> Government at the same time, but there are no formal mechanisms for streamlining the development<lb/> and reporting process.<lb/> The OPM and the MEI have the authority to require that ministries submit their plans in line with<lb/> priorities, and they can set the agenda for ministries. The system has formal mechanisms that require<lb/> prudent planning in terms of setting achievable deadlines, creating links with budgetary resources to<lb/> ensure implementation, and foreseeing and planning for other possible impacts. Both institutions have<lb/> produced detailed guidelines for ministries to simplify the planning and reporting process.<lb/></p>

			<p>The MTEF is developed by the MoF; it is compiled for three years and is approved annually in April. It is a<lb/> clear statement of the Government&apos;s priorities as set out in the DP, followed by macroeconomic and<lb/> fiscal analyses, a sectoral expenditure analysis and individual fiches for budgetary operators, setting out<lb/> objectives and three-year expenditure ceilings.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ministries compile various strategic documents; a list of strategies to be developed is annexed to the<lb/> GAWP. In February 2013, 59 strategic documents were in force. Of these, 44 can be considered<lb/> strategies and five have the characteristics of sectoral strategies, covering the policy field in full 23 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Guiding the development of the</p>

			<table>Statement of Priorities and its application in the MTEF and GAWP<lb/> development processes was a challenge for the SPO of the OPM in 2012, mainly due to vacant positions.<lb/> The SPO was strengthened in 2013 with two additional staff. The process of developing the Statement of<lb/> Priorities has been changed in order to move from macro-level priorities to sectoral-level priorities and<lb/> to link priorities with the development of sectoral strategies and medium-term budgetary ceilings. The<lb/> stated efforts are steps in the right direction and will strengthen the priority-setting and implementation<lb/> capacities of the Government, including in the SAA process, and enable the more efficient use of scarce<lb/> resources. Analysis of the coherence of key strategic documents – the MTEF and the GAWP –<lb/> demonstrates that the situation improved in 2012, with both documents approved for the year 2013 and<lb/> beyond being more coherent compared with the documents adopted in the previous year. Their<lb/> structure and priority objectives follow the structure of the Programme of the Government and are<lb/> largely consistent.<lb/> However, in 2013, when developing the Declaration of Priorities 2014-2016 and MTEF for the same<lb/> period, co-operation of the OPM with the MoF deteriorated. Commitment of the MoF to contribute to<lb/> the development of the priorities to ensure alignment with the financial opportunities of the<lb/> Government remains a challenge. The SPO of the OPM and the MoF are still applying a somewhat<lb/> different approach to the Government priorities, leading to a modified version of priorities in the MTEF<lb/> 22<lb/> The GCS evaluates the quarterly reports on the following three criteria: 1) quality of reporting; 2) meeting of<lb/> implementation deadline; 3) level of implementation.<lb/> 23<lb/> A list of strategic documents in force is provided by the SPO of the OPM; concrete numbers are derived from<lb/> expert analysis of the stated list.<lb/> compared with the Declaration of Priorities prepared by the SPO and approved by the Government. As<lb/> the guardian of financial resources, the MoF must accommodate the Government priorities within the<lb/> funding opportunities of the state, a consideration which is not fully taken into account during the<lb/> development of the priorities statement. Better co-operation is therefore needed between the MoF and<lb/> the OPM, and mechanisms need to be built into the planning process to frame the prioritisation exercise<lb/> within short and medium-term funding opportunities.<lb/></table>

			<p>The planning of coherent sectoral measures in the MTEF, GAWP and APSAA has improved, but can<lb/> evolve further. Whilst remarkably improved, compared to 2012, the integration of EI priority measures<lb/> into other key strategic documents can be further enhanced.<lb/> This analysis demonstrates that the planning involved in the implementation of Government priorities<lb/> still varies between individual ministries, so overall planning quality depends on ministerial capacities.<lb/> The planning of work in policy areas that fall under several ministries is still challenging for the<lb/> administration.<lb/></p>

To analyse coherence of the MTEF and GAWP with the EPAP (2012) and APSAA (2013),<lb/> inclusion of EPAP/APSAA objectives, priority measures and sectoral measures in the MTEF and GAWP were<lb/> assessed.<lb/> 25<lb/></table>

			<p>When the structure of the documents in the section of priorities and in sectoral sectors was the same,<lb/> documents were assessed as consistent. When the difference was not more than one heading under each<lb/> priority area (in the case of sectoral sections, priority objectives and measures), documents were assessed as<lb/> largely consistent. When up to three headings differed, documents were considered partly consistent. When<lb/> the difference was greater, documents were considered slightly consistent or not at all.<lb/></p>

			<p>The analysis of 2012 working practices and the study of key strategic documents demonstrate that both<lb/> the OPM and the MEI have the capacity to guide the development process of the GAWP 2013 and the<lb/> APSAA respectively. The process for the development of these documents has been streamlined in terms<lb/> of timing. Both documents were adopted at the last Government session of 2012. Nevertheless, the<lb/> analysis of the documents and working practices demonstrates that prioritising the various obligations<lb/> remains a challenge, in the case of both EI-related processes and policy making in general.<lb/></p>

			<p>The linkage between planning priorities and the budgetary process can be still improved, in particular at<lb/> the level of ministries. The MTEF 2013-2015 comprises narrative material regarding high-level<lb/> governmental priorities and strategic objectives, which are complemented by objectives and associated<lb/> resources at the level of individual ministries or budgetary operators (BOs). The BO-level material<lb/> includes an overview presentation of mission, context (current situation), objectives and activities,<lb/> together with an allocation of resources in aggregate terms to each activity. This descriptive material is<lb/> clearly and logically presented and has been significantly streamlined from the previous year&apos;s MTEF.<lb/> Each BO chapter also includes the more formal, tabular presentation of expenditure ceilings on a<lb/> functional rather than programmatic basis. Since the functional tables form the basis of the budget<lb/> appropriations, and of subsequent audit by the Office of the Auditor General, the programmatic<lb/> allocations are indicative rather than normative.<lb/></p>

			<p>In principle, this process sets the foundation for a coherent strategy-driven approach to resource<lb/> allocation and is a basic, potentially useful &quot; presentational &quot; approach to performance-type budgeting,<lb/> with some elements of the more developed &quot; performance-informed &quot; approach. In practice, the<lb/> alignment between the objectives at the central government level and BO-level objectives is not<lb/> apparent, and there is little cross-referencing from the BO level back to the broader priorities.<lb/> Understandably, there is no visible linkage between these priorities and budget allocations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Evidence obtained from interviews indicates that for some EI-related obligations, ministries feel<lb/> considerable pressure from the centre (MEI, OPM) towards more ambitious deadlines and feel bound to<lb/> accept those deadlines, which may be clearly undeliverable from the start. Comparative analyses of the<lb/> 2012 EPAP with the 2013 APSAA indicates that, on average, 36% of primary legislation that was planned<lb/> for adoption in the EPAP was delayed and subsequently incorporated into the 2013 APSAA with renewed<lb/> deadlines. However, ministries that have more than an average number of primary law-drafting duties<lb/> are overburdened. They also tend to be the ministries with more postponed deadlines, such as the MI,<lb/> the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW), the MAFRD, and the MESP (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/> At the same time, specific tasks within the EPAP and APSAA, as well as in the GAWP, are usually formed<lb/> bottom-up, with little scrutiny or prioritisation from the centre (although more with EI matters, due to<lb/> the European Commission&apos;s Progress Reports). The OPM and the MEI should, implement more stringent<lb/> criteria to focus on the most important tasks and scale the workload down to more manageable levels,<lb/> bearing in mind the limited resources (budgetary resources included) and the capacity in ministries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. Backlog of EI-related primary acts (from 2012 to 2013 and beyond)<lb/> Sources: EPAP 2012; APSAA 2013; and expert analyses.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Monitoring of the implementation of key strategic documents is regular, has a quarterly rhythm and<lb/> provides an overview of the general implementation record of each ministry. The analysis of<lb/> implementation reports of the GAWP and EPAP demonstrates the technical nature of the GAWP<lb/> reporting 28 , which concentrates on taking stock of delivered items. The EPAP reporting also provides an<lb/> overview of implemented activities and does not go into the real implementation or achievement of<lb/> objectives. In the current stage of the system&apos;s maturity, this level of reporting is sufficient and meets<lb/> the general expectations of the European Commission and the Government, although it creates<lb/> additional administrative burdens with parallel reporting requirements from the OPM and the MEI.<lb/></p>

			<p>For now, monitoring mechanisms do not distinguish between process implementation, such as the<lb/> amount of secondary legislation that has been enacted and achievement of intended outcome or for<lb/> example, the amount of road infrastructure built and poverty levels reduced.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Consolidation of the overall strategic planning system remains a challenge. The state of play of planning<lb/> sectorial policies is still fragmented, with a huge tendency for unrealistic planning and visible bottom-up<lb/> pressure leading to unrealistic plans that have not been prioritised.

It establishes procedures<lb/> and requirements for submitted materials as well as consultation, and defines the roles of the relevant<lb/> OPM departments and other key stakeholders. Materials should be submitted to the OPM 15 days<lb/> before the Government session. The RoP also specifies the schedule and recipients for materials<lb/> distributed before and after the meetings, such as the agenda and minutes. The invitation, agenda and<lb/> materials for agenda items must be sent to the relevant units no later than three days before the<lb/> Government session. Draft minutes of the meetings are circulated three days after the session with the<lb/> feedback deadline of two days. The General Secretary provides a detailed overview of what was decided<lb/> in the Government session in the following week&apos;s Council of General Secretaries&apos; meeting. There is also<lb/> a formal procedure to enable the consideration of urgent issues at a Council of Ministers&apos; session 33 .<lb/></table>

			<p>The Government Secretariat is authorised to return items submitted to the Government sessions to<lb/> ministries if the substance is problematic or other requirements are not fulfilled. For example, material<lb/> can be sent back to ministries if the proposal does not contain the opinion of the MoF, the MEI and the<lb/> LO, or if it is not in line with the GAWP and/or Government priorities. In practice, however, the GCS<lb/> resolves issues more informally. It usually consults the proposing ministry and requests additions or<lb/> clarification rather than sending documentation back. For example, no items were sent back to ministries<lb/> in the fourth quarter of 2012 34 .<lb/> EI issues and legislation needed for transposing the acquis follows the same procedure as all Government<lb/> agenda items. However, the MEI is responsible for providing an opinion on harmonisation with the<lb/> acquis. The LO of the OPM follows transposed norms in line with the Constitution and general legal<lb/> framework. Until recently, the MEI was responsible for checking that the proposed legislation does not<lb/> contradict with the acquis. The requirement to steer transposition of the acquis was introduced only in<lb/> 2013.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The overall co-ordination cycle ensures the involvement of key stakeholders and enables inputs at both<lb/> the political and administrative levels as well as sufficient time for processing the dossiers for the OPM.<lb/> Interaction between the political level (the DPMs and advisers of the PM) and the administrative level<lb/> (General Secretary of the OPM and key directors) is active, and the roles of different levels are clear and<lb/> respected by the relevant actors in the process. Government sessions are regularly held on Wednesdays<lb/> and the agenda is set either on the Friday of the week before, or on the Monday after the PM and the<lb/> DPMs have met. The current timing of the Council of General Secretaries meeting, regularly held on<lb/> Tuesday mornings, reduces opportunities for the Council to be active in the preparatory process, and<lb/> restricts the channels available to the ministries for designing session agendas and holding discussions on<lb/> immediate, disputed issues. On Tuesdays, the agenda for the upcoming Government session is already<lb/> fixed and the discussion therefore mainly provides an overview (by the General Secretary) of what is<lb/> included in the agenda.<lb/> Co-ordination of session preparations happens routinely, and relevant rules and time periods are<lb/> generally well adhered to. The GCS has applied a flexible and communicative practice for solving issues<lb/> openly with the ministries and improving the quality of the dossier. Interviews revealed that 60% of the<lb/> items on the agenda are submitted through the normal procedure (15 days ahead), whereas 40% of<lb/> 33<lb/></p>

			<p>Article 33 of the RoP specifies the cases; the reason for the use of the emergency procedure shall be clearly<lb/> reported to the Government and the Minister responsible for the proposal shall, immediately after the<lb/> Government&apos;s discussion of the proposal, ensure that the procedures required under this regulation are<lb/> complied with and reported to the Government as soon as practicable.<lb/></p>

			<p>items are included three to four days before the Government session takes place. Only 1% of agenda<lb/> items are added at the very last minute or through the urgency procedure described in the RoP. An<lb/> average of ten items per agenda is manageable for the OPM.<lb/> In a comparatively small administration with many issues on its agenda which require a rather rapid<lb/> response from the Government, the 15-day submission deadline is too restrictive for ministries, and is<lb/> therefore often not followed. An average of four items out of ten submitted three to four days before<lb/> the session suggests that this is indeed the case. As three to four days does not provide the OPM enough<lb/> time to handle the dossier according to normal working practices, a high volume of late submissions can<lb/> lead to overburdening of the OPM structures and decreasing the quality of their input. Sufficient time for<lb/> processing the materials is crucial: in addition to the basic technical checks, more time allows for<lb/> high-quality analytical input and deeper involvement with the substance of the materials.<lb/> The GCS has a main co-ordination role concerning Government decision making preparations and<lb/> monitoring its decisions. The LO and the SPO are contributing in their area of responsibility in relation to<lb/> legislation, and strategies and priority items, respectively. Both departments routinely provide input on<lb/> dossiers submitted by the ministries. These departments are also involved in the earlier stages of policy<lb/> development, guiding and advising ministries on preparing items to be approved by the Government, as<lb/> well as supporting initiation of relevant preparatory processes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The LO is involved in the preparation of draft laws from the very initial phase. For example, the MTI has<lb/> created a working group for drafting an amendment to the Law on Consumers, of which a representative<lb/> of the LO is a member. If a ministry decides not to create a working group for drafting a law, the person<lb/> in charge within the ministry has to inform the LO of their progress monthly. Once the ministry approves<lb/> the first draft, the legal department sends it to the LO for comments. The final draft is sent once more to<lb/> the LO for its opinion. The SPO also participates in the strategy development process managed by<lb/> ministries. The prioritisation of issues takes into account the limited resources of the SPO, but active<lb/> support for the ministries in the preparatory stages is an opportunity for the OPM which could be better<lb/> exploited. It increases the quality of the materials submitted by the ministries and decreases the<lb/> workload of processing the files submitted to Government sessions.<lb/></p>

			<p>In leading and co-ordinating EI-related decision making and policy development, the MEI has<lb/> under-exploited its existing tools available to incorporate EI commitments into national working<lb/> practices, to act as a watchdog and quality controller of the acquis transposition and give valuable<lb/> feedback to ministries on the matter. Evidence considered from only a few examples of randomly<lb/> selected and translated legal opinions prepared by the MEI showed that the analysed opinions<lb/> concentrate on formalities rather than on content. One ministry demonstrated the case by stressing that<lb/> it had to redraft and resubmit one quarter of all legislative acts in 2012, which had previously been given<lb/> the green light from the MEI via its legal opinions. It later emerged that these acts failed to transpose the<lb/> directives they were supposed to. Also, the MEI concentrated only on the text of the law itself, without<lb/> addressing possible problems in achieving the aims of the acquis. The MEI&apos;s capacity to give meaningful<lb/> feedback thus remains a challenge. The recent decision of the MEI to assign members of staff in the<lb/> relevant departments as contact points for each ministry, and to co-ordinate activities between the MEI<lb/> and relevant ministry therefore merits approval.<lb/></p>

			<table>The MEI employed in 2013 four to five lawyers, and although the anticipated number of staff members is<lb/> seven, this will still not be enough to cope with the workload. It is also clear that the real expertise of the<lb/> sectoral acquis should be developed within the ministries. The MEI should focus not only on the<lb/> approximation of the text of law itself but also more on possible problems regarding delivery of the aims<lb/> of the acquis. As the EU itself will increasingly emphasise the need to achieve actual and measurable<lb/> progress in different policy fields (on commitments made by Kosovo), in order to proceed with the EI<lb/> process the MEI could also replicate this in national planning by putting more emphasis in the planning<lb/> documents on achieving measurable progress of real outcomes on the ground. An outcome-based<lb/> approach is not anything new, and is already used by the MTI in defining their yearly priorities 35 . This<lb/> practice could be developed further by enhancing the MEI&apos;s capacity to lead this shift and provide<lb/> feedback to guide ministries should be planned.<lb/> In this respect, the decision of MEI to nominate members of its staff in relevant departments as<lb/> contact-points for each ministry, to serve as focal points for co-ordination activities between MEI and the<lb/> ministry, merits approval. The Government should focus in the coming years on strengthening the<lb/> capacities in the central co-ordination bodies (OMP, MEI, MoF).<lb/> 35<lb/> The booklet entited &quot; MTI priorities of 2013 &quot; not only sets desired qualitative aims and outcomes but also<lb/> tries to budget for and co-ordinate the use of different aid programmes for different tasks.<lb/></table>

			<head>2<lb/> POLICY DEVELOPMENT IN MINISTRIES<lb/> 2.1<lb/> Legislative framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The new policy development procedures and requirements ministries must follow were established in<lb/> the RoP adopted in 2011 and enforced at the beginning of 2012. Compared with the previous version,<lb/> the RoP introduced new elements for enhancing the use of policy analysis and changed the<lb/> interministerial consultation and co-operation principles used for policy development.<lb/> Since the beginning of 2012, the originating body of a draft policy proposal is obliged to send a policy<lb/> analysis or concept document for approval to the Government before drafting the legislative act. Within<lb/> a month of the approval of the policy analysis/concept paper, the responsible ministry should start<lb/> drafting the legislative acts in compliance with the deadlines set out in the approved GAWP 36 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Concept papers usually precede new primary legislation or amendments to primary legislation,<lb/> important secondary legislation, and recommendations that have significant social, economic or other<lb/> impacts. Concept documents also precede proposals that have high implementation costs, or represent<lb/> important Government or ministry priorities 37 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Interministerial consultation is required for all policy proposals, although there is no requirement to<lb/> consult all ministries, only the central state administration and those affected by the proposal. The<lb/> requirement to create inter-ministry working groups was in place from 2007 to 2011 but discontinued<lb/> under the current RoP 38 . It is too early to say whether and what impact this has had on the policy making<lb/> process. The process is summarised in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ministries have 15 working days to comment on the proposal, although this deadline can be shortened if<lb/> the ministry needs a more timely response for reasons of genuine urgency outside its control, or<lb/> lengthened if a more thorough examination is required. 39<lb/></p>

			<p>Requirements for consultation are mandatory and ministries should consult relevant institutions in<lb/> advance of drafting concept papers, explanatory memorandum, draft laws or sub-legal acts, a strategic<lb/> plan of a ministry or a sectorial strategy for deliberation by the Government.</p>

			<table>Key government<lb/> stakeholders who must be consulted are well defined, and the RoP also covers the list of institutions<lb/> which should be consulted when defined criteria are met. The originating body is also obliged to consult<lb/> the public 40 . The RoP specifies which institution and stakeholders should be consulted and at which stage<lb/> of the proposal.<lb/> 36<lb/> Articles 28, 29 and 38 of the RoP.<lb/> 37<lb/> Article 29 of the RoP.<lb/> 38<lb/> Articles 38 to 41 of the RoP.<lb/> 39<lb/> Article 7 of the RoP.<lb/> 40<lb/> Articles 7 and 32 of the RoP mandate consultation.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Figure 4. Stakeholders in the interministerial consultation process<lb/> Source: The RoP, interviews.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The RoP does not specify what methods of consultation should be used, but does make it clear that the<lb/> originating body is obliged to send the concept paper or draft law to the relevant institution for<lb/> consultation and, once the consultation is closed, detail the comments received from the other bodies<lb/> together with an indication of whether such comments were incorporated in the proposal and, if not, the<lb/> reasons why 41 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Kosovo</p>

			<table>has made good progress in enhancing its approach to policy development, although the process<lb/> is still hampered by varying skills and capacities within the ministries and poor availability of data and<lb/> statistics. The RoP provides a sufficient policy development framework for the ministries, which follows<lb/> practices used in the EU and OECD countries.<lb/> 41<lb/> Article 7 of the RoP.<lb/></table>

			<p>Introducing the principle of using concept papers for policy analysis in the early phase of the policy<lb/> making process was a step in the right direction. The current RoP does not require ministries to establish<lb/> interministerial working groups for preparation of draft law/policy documents, so policy staff from other<lb/> ministries or the Government Secretariat may not be involved in the initial policy development phase.<lb/> However, ministries are still establishing internal working groups, where policy staff from other<lb/> ministries can be involved. This has been the case when policy papers were developed in 2012 by the<lb/> Ministry of Health (MH) and the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS). The CoG is involved in the<lb/> prior consultation phase and when the ministries send the final draft to the GCS/LO. At these stages,<lb/> they are supposed to check the quality of the concept document or explanatory memorandum. The<lb/> newly introduced approach involves the risk of decreased policy consultations and may impact the<lb/> quality of legislation; however, it is too early yet to assess the functioning of the new system.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> Policy development arrangements and capacity in the ministries<lb/> 2.2.1<lb/> Policy development structures<lb/></head>

			<p>The structure of the ministries and the responsibilities of management positions and departments are<lb/> outlined in each ministry&apos;s regulations on internal organisation and systematisation of positions. The<lb/> reorganisation of all ministries was taking place whilst this review was being conducted; this process is<lb/> co-ordinated by the MPA. As a general logic, all ministries should have a similar structure, composed of<lb/> policy departments, whose number and tasks are not centrally decided; functional departments, such as<lb/> the DEIPC and Legal Department (LD); and supporting departments, such as a Finance and General<lb/> Services Department, a Communication and Public Relations Division, a Public Procurement Division and<lb/> an Internal Audit Division. Each ministry is headed by the General Secretary, which has a small support<lb/> office. There is also the Cabinet of the Minister, consisting of Deputy Ministers, political advisers and<lb/> support staff.<lb/></p>

			<p>The responsibilities of the two functional departments are determined through horizontal legislation.<lb/> The work of the legal departments is guided by several pieces of horizontal legislation, in particular by<lb/> the administrative instruction on organisation and scope of legal services of the Government of Kosovo 42 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The creation of DEIPCs in all ministries was launched centrally in 2011. The authority and responsibilities<lb/> of these departments are established by regulation 01/2011, which details functions of DEIPCs for all<lb/> ministries except CoG institutions -the MEI, MoF and OPM -which have the flexibility to organise<lb/> themselves. These departments in the ministries are responsible for policy co-ordination and planning,<lb/> as well as co-ordinating EI issues. As a general rule, there are specific divisions within the DEIPC for<lb/> fulfilling those functions.<lb/> Whilst performing their tasks and duties, ministries tend to maintain regular co-operation with the OPM,<lb/> MEI, and the MoF. The guidance for the EI agenda to these departments comes from the MEI, and the<lb/> guidance for the strategic planning and identification of ministerial priorities comes from the SPO of the<lb/> OPM. Relations with the MoF are not formalised and/or institutionalised.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The reorganisation of the organisational structures of ministries creates the opportunity to establish<lb/> policy development roles within ministries more clearly, and integrate functional departments into<lb/> mainstream structures and working practices within each ministry. Similar organisational structures<lb/> should support interministerial co-operation and make administration more transparent.<lb/> However, analysis of the regulations on internal organisation and the systematisation of working<lb/> positions reveals that responsibilities for policy development are often not explicitly set out in the<lb/> regulations. As a general practice, in EU and OECD countries, policy development is a key function of the<lb/> administrative apparatus of the ministry, with responsibilities determined at a higher managerial level<lb/> and clear functions established for policy departments. In the case of Kosovo, the analysis of regulations<lb/> from five ministries approved by the Government up to April 2013, reveals a common pattern where a<lb/> triad – the LD, DEIPCs and line departments ─ are involved in policy development and drafting of<lb/> legislation, but it is not clear who takes the lead. In most cases, line departments ensure implementation<lb/> of policies, analyse situations and handle monitoring as well as data collection. A commonly used term<lb/> for responsibility over legislative processes is &quot; co-operation with the Legal Department in drafting<lb/> legislation. &quot; Terminology varies more in the developing of policies and strategies where, in some cases,<lb/> line departments are expected to draft policies and, in other cases, contribute to policy development.<lb/> Often, common terminology is not applied for all line departments at the same ministry; rather, each<lb/> department has its own interpretation of the roles.<lb/> According to regulations on the internal organisation of ministries, in cases where policy development<lb/> responsibility is clearly set, it is assigned to a department and its director, who fulfils this responsibility in<lb/> co-operation with other departments and with the Cabinet of the Minister. Higher administrative<lb/> managerial positions – the General Secretaries, for example – are not formally responsible for policy<lb/> development; however, they submit the dossier to the OPM for the Government sessions. Interviews in<lb/> sample ministries confirmed that policy development happens mainly at the level of the department and<lb/> has a rather technical nature. Final policy decisions are taken in the Cabinet of the Minister, which<lb/> processes all the files before they are sent out from the ministry.<lb/></p>

			<p>The policy development capacity of the ministries remains a challenge due to staffing: policy<lb/> development departments still account for only a modest share of overall positions compared to<lb/> enforcement and administrative support functions. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> below illustrates the distribution of staff<lb/> across the four key functions within two line ministries 43 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In OECD and EU countries, ministries have different types and functions, for example in some countries<lb/> the whole enforcement staff (e.g. tax inspectors or teachers) is ministry officials and belong to the<lb/> department of the ministry. Therefore, comparisons between the countries are hard to make. However,<lb/> some conclusions can be drawn when analysing ministries in a given country and comparing results with<lb/> the countries with similar administration set-up.<lb/> 43<lb/></p>

			<p>The categorisation of staff is made according to four categories: 1) Policy; 2) Enforcement; 3) Functional<lb/> support, such as legal departments and co-ordination of EU affairs; 4) Administrative support staff. To<lb/> enable more precise analysis and to demonstrate that ministries have different type of tasks, one category<lb/> (enforcement) was added to the categories used by Kosovo authorities in the reorganisation process. This<lb/> approximate categorisation was undertaken by SIGMA, based on commonly recognised roles within<lb/> government administrations. The Secretary-General&apos;s Office and the Cabinet of the Minister are excluded<lb/> from the data set, as the aim was to compare staff numbers in key departments.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. Share of positions in different departments<lb/> MTI<lb/> MAFRD<lb/> Source: Data provided by MTI and MAFRD through questionnaire.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Although the cases of these two ministries do not provide a complete picture (in MAFRD enforcement<lb/> functions is understandably more relevant compared with the MTI), they allow indicative conclusions to<lb/> be drawn. When excluding the enforcement function, the share of administrative staff is more numerous<lb/> in both ministries compared with the number of staff in line departments.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6.

			<table>MTI<lb/> MAFRD<lb/> Analysing the allocation of positions in the Ministry of Local Government Administration 44 confirms these<lb/> conclusions. 31% of positions (41 in total) were allocated to policy development departments. Out of<lb/> those, around 40% deal directly with policy development issues and 60% concentrate more on<lb/> enforcement. The share of functional departments is 25% and administrative departments is 44%. Such a<lb/> distribution of resources impairs the capacity of the ministries to handle the policy development<lb/> workload and implement a high-quality process with proper policy analysis.<lb/></table>

			<p>Ministries have generally launched structures to deal with EI co-ordination, strategic planning and policy<lb/> development. Departments for EI and Policy Co-ordination (with slight variations in precise title) exist in<lb/> all ministries. However, as the ministries were free to choose how best to arrange the new structure,<lb/> there are still three ministries which have other units with a similar mandate, which risks confusion and<lb/> duplication of functions. For example, the MIA has the department for co-ordination and the DEIPC, and<lb/> the MPA has the DEIPC and the department of PAR, whose scope is similar.<lb/></p>

			<p>These departments are embryonic and suffering from some challenges. They are not fully staffed and are<lb/> not widely recognised within some ministries. For example, in Kosovo&apos;s 2013 Budget Law, only three<lb/> ministries (MTI, MoF and MJ) made note of a separate EI department; the other ministries have<lb/> submerged the department within the subheading &quot; central administration &quot; and the average staffing rate<lb/> at the end of 2012 was 78%. As the DEIPCs are relatively new and were set-up by a central order, it is not<lb/> surprising that the actual profile of the departments and their ability to fulfil these tasks varies<lb/> considerably. The actual capacities of all structures to implement ambitious goals are very limited.<lb/> Still, some promising bright spots such as the MTI seem to be emerging already. In the MTI, the EI<lb/> department has been able to partly fulfil the tasks of a policy co-ordination unit, leading the preparation<lb/> of horizontal strategies (merging the existing 11 into a single horizontal strategy) and co-ordinating the<lb/> preparation of the Ministry&apos;s annual plans (including budgetary plans). But in most cases they seem to<lb/> lack an actual presence within ministries&apos; policy making processes and thus have little impact on content.<lb/> The majority of EI departments in the ministries seem to function as post offices with little capacity and<lb/> limited expertise on substance.<lb/></p>

			<p>In most cases, the EI departments are also not sufficiently staffed. Moreover, neither the actual nor<lb/> planned staff numbers adequately reflect the needs deriving from planned obligations a given ministry&apos;s<lb/> EI department must monitor and report on, or generally co-ordinate and give input into, as per the 2013<lb/> SAA Action Plan. The analysis summarised in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> indicates that the EI departments in at least three<lb/> ministries, MTI, MESP and MIA, have larger workloads in comparison with obligations than those in other<lb/> ministries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>44<lb/> Regulation No. 03/2013 on the Internal Organisation and Systematisation of Jobs in the MLGA.<lb/> Figure 7. Obligations foreseen in the 2013 SAA Action Plan in comparison with staff numbers<lb/> Source: MEI, APSAA 2013.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The above chart is, of course, indicative and fails to present a comprehensive picture. For example, the<lb/> obligations for the MAFRD are probably higher in reality, as the Veterinary and Food Agency (curiously<lb/> formally under the PM&apos;s structure) has a number of obligations, including legislative and regulative, that<lb/> are not covered in the analyses, but involve the MAFRD at least indirectly. Nevertheless, it indicates<lb/> broad trends and gaps. In this regard, the MoF, MH and MI also have a considerable number of<lb/> obligations in comparison with staff members in their EI departments. It is important to note that the<lb/> picture does not change when the number of obligations is compared to the overall number of<lb/> employees in ministries&apos; central administrations, or those in the offices of ministers. If anything, the<lb/> contrasts between the &apos;overburdened&apos; and the rest become even sharper (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). The need to<lb/> strengthen the staff capacities of the more overburdened ministries is clear. As any additional budgetary<lb/> allocations will be limited, the budgetary applications for additional staff recruitment in the more<lb/> burdened ministries should be a priority. Only once their essential needs are satisfied should the staff of<lb/> DEIPCs in the rest of the ministries be increased.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.2<lb/> Policy development processes<lb/></head>

			<p>The policy development process as established by the RoP, and the main principles of policy<lb/> development and interministerial consultation, were already described in this review. Here it is analysed<lb/> how responsible stakeholders are implementing the principles and to what extent the process is<lb/> followed by the ministries. Special attention is given to the implementation of novelties introduced with<lb/> the new RoP, namely conducting policy analysis and holding interministerial consultations.<lb/> Policy analysis includes the consideration of different options and their consequences in order that the<lb/> Government can make adequately informed decisions. The extent and complexity of the analysis should<lb/> be proportionate to the importance of the issue, for example where it ranks in the Government&apos;s<lb/> strategic priorities. The policy analysis shall be conducted with the preparation of a concept paper or<lb/> explanatory memorandum and, in some cases, a fiscal analysis. Guidelines for conducting a FIA are<lb/> issued by the MoF and are annexed to the RoP. The annex covers both the process and format for fiscal<lb/> assessments. Whilst this review was conducted, the MoF was developing instructions for determining<lb/> the form, content and procedures and cost of new policy initiatives. Separate guidelines for preparing<lb/> policy papers are established by the OPM.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are some requirements and mechanisms in place for planning implementation in the policy<lb/> development process, but these are not uniform. Not all materials submitted to the Government require<lb/> an implementation plan. For example for two key topics – the GAWP and legislation – there is no such<lb/> requirement. However, or strategic documents, details about implementation are required to be<lb/> submitted 45 . The FIA has a section which addresses implementation issues including guarantees, loans,<lb/> or other actual or contingent obligations on the Government. There is no requirement to conduct an<lb/> ex-post evaluation of implementation of Government policies. However, there are monitoring<lb/> arrangements in place to assess the implementation of the GAWP and other decisions of the<lb/> Government.<lb/> During the interministerial consultation process, the MoF, the OPM, the MEI and other relevant<lb/> institutions are consulted twice: on the first and on the final drafts. A ministry shall submit the final draft<lb/> of the law/proposal to the Secretariat 15 days before the Government meeting at which it is to be<lb/> discussed. This permits the Government Secretariat to verify that the materials are complete and can be<lb/> submitted to the Government meeting for approval. Relevant line ministries and other stakeholders are<lb/> consulted once, on the first official draft.<lb/></p>

			<p>The consultation process with non-governmental stakeholders shall be conducted in accordance with the<lb/> Guidelines for Public Consultation Process 46 . They specify that the originating ministry shall publish the<lb/> substance of its proposal for public comment and shall specifically seek the comments of any<lb/> non-governmental organisation that would be affected substantially by the proposal. In conducting this<lb/> consultation, the originating body shall provide sufficient information in a publicly understandable form<lb/> to permit the public to comprehend the nature and consequences of the proposal. The originating body<lb/> also must publicly announce the beginning of the consultation and permit sufficient time for the public<lb/> and non-governmental organisations to consider the recommendations and offer a considered<lb/> response 47 . The results of such consultations shall be reported to the Government meeting or Ministerial<lb/> Committee as part of the concept document or explanatory memorandum. The Guidelines do not specify<lb/> a minimum or maximum period of time allowed for a Government response.<lb/></p>

			<figure>45<lb/> Article 10 of administrative instruction 02/2012 on preparing Strategic Documents and Plans for their<lb/> Implementation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Concerning the internal processes of the ministries in submitting materials to the Government session,<lb/> the General Secretary of each ministry is designated to submit all required documentation to the<lb/> relevant part of the OPM. The legal department sends the first and final drafts to the General Secretary<lb/> and Cabinet of the Minister through the General Secretary. However, the materials for the proposed<lb/> laws are not always reviewed at the meeting of the General Secretary and the Directors of Department 48 .<lb/> Co-operation between key functional departments and line departments has an informal nature; there<lb/> are normally no formal internal procedures, and in each ministry the process depends on the leverage of<lb/> each department and traditional working practices.<lb/></p>

			<p>The ministries have new challenges in the policy development process derived from the SAA<lb/> negotiations, and more widely from the intensified EI process. The legal framework for transposing the<lb/> acquis is in place. However, the capacity of the ministries to follow the requirements and successfully<lb/> fulfil the tasks required by the SAA process depends mainly on their ability to fully develop and make use<lb/> of the system of tables of concordance. Although some ministries have already made the first steps in<lb/> using this tool, the instrument is not yet fully functional and although the Parliament&apos;s RoP foresee that<lb/> all draft laws submitted by the Government will be accompanied by the tables, the executive does not<lb/> yet have the capacity to deliver on this.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The policy development structures in ministries are small, but they have proved to be effective and have<lb/> been used flexibly, notably through working groups, to mobilise resources for particular analytical or<lb/> preparatory work required prior to the elaboration of new policies. Interministerial and public<lb/> consultation works routinely, but is often partial and at a fairly late stage in the drafting process.<lb/></p>

			<p>In total, 47 concept papers were submitted to the Government by 11 ministries in 2012. The largest<lb/> number of them was developed by the MIA and the MoF (7 each). A sample of 15 concept papers was<lb/> evaluated, which highlighted the varying quality of the analysis 49 . The examples analysed show that<lb/> ministries do tend to fulfil the requirements of a concept paper, but the level of detail within each of the<lb/> seven required sections, such as problem analysis and results of consultation with civil society, can be<lb/> variable 50 . The policy analysis in the concept papers tends to be fairly superficial, often without financial<lb/> analysis, or it is narrowly focussed on whether the proposal is affordable within the current budgetary<lb/> agreement rather than in terms of the systemic impact (e.g. whether the proposal would impose costs<lb/> on businesses).<lb/></p>

			<p>There could be greater alignment between concept papers and key strategic planning documents and<lb/> budget management. The budgetary detail included in concept papers demonstrates an inconsistent<lb/> approach to conducting budgetary impact analyses, and the level of detail and rigour is varied. The<lb/> scheduling and handling of concept papers within the budgetary and policy making process has not yet<lb/> matured to the point where the papers can maximise their impact on decision making. Whilst some are<lb/> included in the Government&apos;s legislative programme, they are very rarely included in the APSAA or the<lb/> GAWP.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Compliance with the requirements for concept papers<lb/></figure>

			<head>Source: analysis of 15 concept documents submitted to the OPM by ministries in 2012.<lb/></head>

			<p>The capability of ministries to plan ahead and to include implementation costs, as well as the capacity to<lb/> scrutinise draft proposals within the CoG remains challenging. The ministries claim they do not have the<lb/> capacity to carry out these tasks, as the requests are disproportionate to the number of assigned staff.<lb/> Moreover, the instrument of the concept paper is a new process for the GCS and line ministries and, as a<lb/> result, their capacities are limited.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ministries have begun to follow new requirements for interministerial consultations, although<lb/> mechanisms and policy development deal more with process than content. Consultation input from<lb/> external organisations is virtually non-existent. Random examples of consulting non-governmental<lb/> stakeholders demonstrated good implementation of procedures, but feedback from them was very<lb/> limited. For example, a draft law on Geographical Indications was sent by the MTI to all relevant business<lb/> associations: no feedback was received from any of them. This is unfortunate, as consultation brings<lb/> many benefits, including a greater likelihood of the proposed changes working, as stakeholders have<lb/> been involved in the development of the solution from the outset and government processes become<lb/> more transparent and accountable to the public. This process enables both governments and citizens to<lb/> understand the costs and benefits of potential changes and to make informed decisions about legislation<lb/> that affects their lives.<lb/></p>

			<p>The implementation of new principles for the transposition of the acquis, and using the tables of<lb/> concordance in policy development, are still in their early phases. First, there is no coherent baseline<lb/> which could be used in a systematic way for creating a horizontal list of acquis to be scrutinised during<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> 8<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 70<lb/> 80<lb/> 90<lb/> 100<lb/></figure>

As there has not been any systematic screening exercise, the ministries do not<lb/> appear to know which parts of EU legislation are relevant in different policy fields or where to find this<lb/> information. There also does not appear to be a database which could be used to organise and save the<lb/> relevant information which will be accumulated over time. This issue may be settled in a centralised<lb/> manner as the LO has plans to establish a database, which could also accommodate information<lb/> regarding transposition.<lb/></table>

			<p>There is also some confusion within the ministries regarding the division of labour between the Legal<lb/> Departments and DEIPCs. The recently adopted Regulation on Legal Services should make the necessary<lb/> clarifications. According to it, the legal departments of line ministries will be responsible for the tables of<lb/> concordance ─ ensuring that they are accurate, formulated according to instructions, etc. ─ and<lb/> co-ordinating the work of transposition. In this context, the issue of co-operation between the DEIPCs<lb/> and legal departments of ministries merits some further clarification. It has happened that when<lb/> ministries have to respond to new demands (for example, requests to respond to European Commission<lb/> questions), DEIPCs are sometimes side-lined and issues are passed directly to legal departments or<lb/> operational/functional departments in the ministries. As DEIPCs are in charge of overall monitoring and<lb/> reporting of the EI process, they should be part of the discussion or at least be informed. In the course of<lb/> enacting the new procedures, ministries must strengthen the link between strategic planning and<lb/> monitoring of the EI process (both done by DEIPCs) and execution of transposition (co-ordinated by the<lb/> legal departments).<lb/> Second, practices in implementing normative standards of transposition are still limited. It is<lb/> commendable that the MEI (in co-operation with GIZ) has prepared a practical manual on how to fulfil<lb/> the tables, which should help the ministries to execute this new obligation; however, a prioritised<lb/> approach is needed both to launching new transpositions rules and providing capacity building to<lb/> ministries.<lb/> Third, due to the limited number of people in the ministries who have a good knowledge of English (or<lb/> any other EU official language), there is a lack of comprehension of the acquis (especially in the legal<lb/> departments).<lb/></p>

			<p>Another crucial functional capacity which must be enhanced within the ministries in order to deliver the<lb/> implementation goals the SAA process envisions, is forward budgetary planning. For example, in the<lb/> 2012 EPAP, the MESP had 14 laws to draft with a deadline of 2012, including the &quot; Law on Kosovo<lb/> waters &quot; , the &quot; Law on Nuclear Security and Protection from Radiation &quot; and &quot; Amending and<lb/> Supplementing the Law on Chemicals &quot; . The total financial impact of these 14 laws (which also included<lb/> waste management) was estimated at EUR 5 000 51 . The reason for such a small sum is that only the cost<lb/> of drafting the necessary bills (legal consultation, possible foreign expertise) was planned and thus linked<lb/> with the budget, but the actual implementation costs were not. Although costs are generally foreseen in<lb/> the second phase (after legislation has been promulgated and implementation measures are drafted),<lb/> the lack of foresight in the legislative phase has hampered the ministries&apos; ability to ensure proper funding<lb/> for implementation. Many interviewees pointed to foreign assistance as the main source of funding,<lb/> used by more enterprising ministries to ensure coverage of implementation costs for new legislation.<lb/> This system, however, is not sustainable. The proper use of concept papers could be one way of<lb/> enhancing forward planning in the ministries.<lb/></p>

			<head>3<lb/> POLICY MAKING IN PARLIAMENT<lb/></head>

			<p>This chapter examines the role of the Assembly of Kosovo in policy making. The review is prepared with a<lb/> number of assumptions about the role of parliaments in the policy process. First, parliaments have a<lb/> positive contribution to make throughout all stages of the policy cycle, including: agenda-setting, policy<lb/> formulation, decision-taking, implementation and evaluation, though the relative emphases vary.<lb/> Second, the orientation towards enhancing the quality of public action and public policy affects not only<lb/> the legislative process, but also other key functions, such as the budgetary process, parliamentary<lb/> oversight and control over the executive, and parliamentary involvement in EU integration. Third, whilst<lb/> the focus of this review is on the internal conditions shaping the impact of the Assembly on public policy<lb/> making, this contribution is decisively influenced by the quality of interinstitutional relationships, most<lb/> notably with the Government, but also with public sector institutions, civil society, and international<lb/> bodies. Finally, a policy-focused analysis needs to focus on both political and administrative structures<lb/> and procedures in Parliament.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following analysis focuses on areas seen as critical to parliamentary policy making. Whilst the review<lb/> contains descriptive material, the emphasis is on highlighting potential bottlenecks within the<lb/> parliamentary policy process. It should be noted that some of the points highlighted have also been<lb/> raised in other documents, notably: the</p>

			<table>European Commission&apos;s Kosovo Analytical Report 2012, the<lb/> Commission&apos;s Feasibility Study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and<lb/> Kosovo 2012, the Joint Report to the European Parliament and the Council, on Kosovo&apos;s progress in<lb/> addressing issues set out in the Council Conclusions of December 2012 in view of a possible decision on<lb/> the opening of negotiations on the SAA of April 2013.<lb/></table>

			<head>3.1<lb/> Legal framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The normative framework that regulates the policy related powers of the Assembly consists of a range of<lb/> sources, including, inter alia, the Constitution, notably its Chapter IV (Articles 63 to 82), and the RoP of<lb/> the Assembly, including several annexes. Some committees, such as the Committee for Budget and<lb/> Finance, have adopted additional RoP. A range of other laws also touch on individual aspects relevant to<lb/> the policy making powers and capacity of the Parliament, such as: the Law on the Financing of Political<lb/> Parties of 2010, amended and supplemented in 2011, which regulates, amongst other matters, the<lb/> provision of funds for parliamentary party groups; legal acts that contain the reporting requirements of<lb/> the public authorities and independent regulatory bodies to the Assembly; laws on financial<lb/> management and accountability, which spell out the powers of the Assembly in the different stages of<lb/> the budget process; and the Law on the Civil Service, which also applies to most Assembly staff. In sum,<lb/> there exists a fairly differentiated legal framework with a clear hierarchy of norms. Moreover, the<lb/> Assembly has adopted a number of &quot; manuals &quot; intended to set out the best procedural practices in a<lb/> number of areas, including: the organisation of work in committees; the holding of committee hearings;<lb/> the consultation of external experts in committees; and the exercise of the oversight and control<lb/> functions at the committee level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Although Kosovo is still in the early stages of its path towards the EU, it is worth considering the early<lb/> adoption of a comprehensive legal framework that would set out the principles and practices governing<lb/> executive-legislative relations in matters pertaining to EU integration. The Assembly&apos;s RoP regulate the<lb/> powers of the Committee for European Integration, but they do not establish anything approaching a<lb/> comprehensive framework for the effective parliamentarisation of the integration process. In any case, it<lb/> is debatable what normative force the RoP possess vis-à-vis the Government and the President of<lb/> Kosovo. This is in contrast to some EU Member States, such as Germany, with its Law on Co-operation<lb/> between the Federal Government and the German Bundestag in matters concerning the EU and the Law<lb/> on Responsibility for Integration, or Denmark, where the Parliament has agreed on a series of legally<lb/> binding reports with the Government on how to handle EU-related matters.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Institutional framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The key elements of the institutional framework include: the Assembly&apos;s Presidency, the parliamentary<lb/> party groups, the plenary, four parliamentary standing committees and nine functional committees, and<lb/> the administration of the Assembly.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1<lb/> Assembly Presidency<lb/></head>

			<p>The main political leadership structure is the Presidency, which consists of the President of the Assembly<lb/> and five Vice Presidents. It is charged with planning and steering the work of the Assembly. The agendas<lb/> of its meetings are publicly available and show that the Presidency is centrally concerned with arranging<lb/> the flow of work for the plenary sessions. For this purpose, it also holds regular meetings with the heads<lb/> of the parliamentary groups.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>At least three points deserve highlighting. First, the President of the Assembly performs a political<lb/> function rather than a primarily ceremonial function, as in some European parliaments. The President<lb/> has his own cabinet, including a Chief of Cabinet, a senior political advisor, and advisers for information,<lb/> legal matters, protocol and international relations, and economic affairs. Members of the President&apos;s<lb/> cabinet are appointed by the President and do not belong to the civil service of the Assembly<lb/> administration. Second, the Presidency, as a whole, is regarded as a political body. Thus, the total of 30<lb/> staff currently working for the Presidency – including chauffeurs – are not subject to the civil service<lb/> legislation that governs the employment of the administrative staff of the Assembly. Their employment<lb/> is tied to the term of office of the Presidency. Third, as will be discussed below, meetings of the<lb/> Presidency are not attended by a representative of the Government, although Article 16 of the RoP<lb/> allows for such participation without voting rights.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2<lb/> Parliamentary party groups<lb/></head>

			<p>As in any parliamentary system, the parliamentary party groups play a key role in structuring the work of<lb/> the Assembly. There are currently eight parliamentary groups, ranging in size from 6 to 34 members.<lb/> There are also six Deputies who do not belong to a group. Some of the groups contain members from<lb/> several political parties, i.e. political parties and party groups are not identical.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>For a number of reasons, it is difficult for the groups to promote the professionalisation and<lb/> specialisation in the work of Deputies that is required to deal with the Assembly&apos;s complex tasks. Only<lb/> the members of the Presidency, the heads of parliamentary groups and chairpersons of committees have<lb/> their own offices at the seat of the Assembly, whereas other Deputies do not have access to dedicated<lb/> office facilities or assistants. The parliamentary party groups themselves employ some advisory staff, but<lb/> these serve primarily the leadership of the group. Six of the eight groups are small, with between 6 and<lb/> 12 members; only the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Democratic Party of Kosovo have 27 and 34<lb/> members respectively. In the case of groups consisting of members of several parties, cohesion is low. It<lb/> is also noteworthy that during the IVth Assembly, 17 elected Deputies have so far resigned their<lb/> positions (for a variety of reasons, including the incompatibility of a parliamentary mandate and the<lb/> Government office), adding further pressures to the policy making capacities of the groups.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3<lb/> Plenary and committees<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<table>main working bodies of the Assembly include the plenary; four standing committees – the<lb/> Committees for Budget and Finance; Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns; Legislation; and EI.<lb/> There are also nine functional committees, dealing with: 1. Foreign Affairs; 2. Economic Development,<lb/> Infrastructure and Industries; 3. Internal Affairs, Security and Supervision of the Kosovo Security Force; 4.<lb/> Human Rights, Gender Equality, Missing Persons and Petitions; 5. Education, Culture, Youth, Sports,<lb/> Public Administration, Local Government and Media; 6. Health, Labour and Social Welfare; 7. Agriculture,<lb/> Forestry, Environment and Spatial Planning; 8. Oversight of the Kosovo Intelligence Agency, and 9.<lb/> Oversight of Public Finances.</table>

			<p>There is also a sub-committee of the Standing Committee for Legislation<lb/> dealing with mandates, immunities and the rules of the Assembly. Finally, as will be explained at greater<lb/> length below, Assembly committees regularly form working groups to deal with individual bills. Each<lb/> standing committee has a dedicated support staff of four members of the Assembly administration. The<lb/> functional committees are normally served by two staff each. The meetings of both committees and<lb/> working groups for the consideration of bills are invariably attended by committee staff.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>An examination of the Assembly&apos;s workload underlines its character as a &quot; working parliament &quot; . As <ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 9</ref> shows, there are weekly or biweekly plenary meetings during the two annual sessions and most<lb/> committees also meet at least once a week during that time.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9: Assembly workload 2011-2012<lb/> Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012.<lb/> Figure 10 below indicates that the legislative workload of the Assembly is considerable. Legislation takes<lb/> up most of the time of the working groups, which consider bills in detail prior to their second reading,<lb/> and also makes up a large part of the agenda of committee meetings and sittings of the plenary.<lb/> Plenary meetings<lb/> Committee meetings<lb/> Working group meetings<lb/> 2011<lb/> 44<lb/> 460<lb/> 297<lb/> 2012<lb/> 48<lb/> 563<lb/> 279<lb/> 0<lb/> 100<lb/> 200<lb/> 300<lb/> 400<lb/> 500<lb/> 600<lb/> Figure 10: Legislative output of the Assembly 2011-2012<lb/> Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The intensive schedule of meetings of the plenary, committees and working groups means that the<lb/> parliamentary support staff, notably the staff of the Division for Committee Support, devotes a large part<lb/> of their time preparing, attending and following up meetings during the two annual sessions of the<lb/> Assembly. As a consequence, time for other tasks, notably the detailed consideration of the reports of<lb/> independent agencies and reviews of the implementation of laws, is scarce.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.4<lb/> Assembly administration<lb/></head>

			<p>The political structures are served by an Assembly administration, which is headed by the Secretary<lb/> General. At the end of 2012, the Assembly had filled 168 posts of 180 approved budgeted positions. Of<lb/> these, about two thirds, 109 staff, possessed a university level education; 96 were male, 72 female. The<lb/> recruitment plan of the Assembly for 2013 envisages the hiring of 11 new staff in total, including a Senior<lb/> Officer for Donor Co-ordination and Relations with Civil Society and two Senior Officers for Legislation in<lb/> the Department for Legal Standardisation and Harmonisation. As already noted, there are also 30 staff<lb/> working for the Presidency who operate outside the organisational structure of the main administration<lb/> (with the exception of two administrative assistants). A number of temporary interns also work at the<lb/> Assembly).<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Several features of the Assembly administration merit further comment. First, it is notable that although<lb/> the overall staff number is not high, there is a considerable degree of organisational differentiation.<lb/> There is the Office of the Secretariat, the</p>

			<table>Department for Media and Public Relations, the Department<lb/> for Protocol and International Relations, and the Department for Procurement. There are also two main<lb/> General Departments – for Legal and Procedural Issues and for Administration – and nine departments<lb/> that report to them. Most of these departments are further divided into units. The organisational set-up<lb/> and associated job descriptions are based on acts of the Presidency. The current structure, with two<lb/> General Departments and nine departments is of recent origin. It was devised in the spring of 2012 and<lb/> became fully functional in the autumn of that year, and was accompanied by a rise in the number of<lb/> Draft laws processed<lb/> Draft laws adopted<lb/> Draft laws returned for<lb/> redrafting<lb/> 2011<lb/> 94<lb/> 65<lb/> 2<lb/> 2012<lb/> 92<lb/> 69<lb/> 7<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 70<lb/> 80<lb/> 90<lb/> 100<lb/> positions of director in the administration. Participants in this process of organisational reform mention<lb/> several reasons for the growth in the number of departments: the desire to establish better direct<lb/> communication between the Secretary-General and staff, and the aim of improving responsibility in the<lb/> administration by increasing the number of managerial positions.<lb/> It is worth considering the allocation of staff across different functions. At present, the General<lb/> Department for Legal and Procedural Issues, with its four Departments for Plenary and Procedural Issues,<lb/> Parliamentary Committees, Standardisation and Legislative Harmonisation, and Research, Archive and<lb/> Library, employs merely a third of the overall Assembly staff. This means that direct support for the core<lb/> bodies and functions of the Assembly takes up a third of personnel capacity, whilst more indirect<lb/> &quot; backroom &quot; functions, such as procurement, IT, internal administration (budget and personnel),<lb/> transport, mail and supplies take up the remainder of resources. Considering the heavy emphasis on<lb/> legislative and oversight and control activities at the level of committees and working groups, the<lb/> number of officials servicing committees and working groups, 36 at present, is small.<lb/></table>

			<p>There are also synergies in the work performed by the Committee for Legislation and its staff, on the one<lb/> hand, and the Unit for Legal Standardisation and Approximation, with three Senior Officers, on the other.<lb/> The Unit carries out an initial analysis of all bills prior to the first reading that focuses on the legal and<lb/> formal aspects of bills, their structure, approximation with EU legislation, and contains recommendations<lb/> regarding content, structure and legal-linguistic formulations, and remarks on the English and Serbian<lb/> versions. The Unit is also in charge of dealing with the finalisation of bills after the amendment process.<lb/> The Committee for Legislation also carries out a compliance assessment with domestic legislation, both<lb/> in its capacity as a standing committee, and as a functional committee during the committee stage of the<lb/> legislative process.<lb/> The Assembly administration does not, thus far, possess autonomy from the Government when it comes<lb/> to personnel policy and is subject to the same civil service legislation as the Government administration.<lb/> Prior to 2010, special regulations were in place that governed employment in the Assembly. More<lb/> critically, the ceiling of posts in the Assembly is set by the MoF, and recruitments require the prior<lb/> approval of the MPA. Thus, the start of recruitment procedures and the setting of grades and pay scales<lb/> can only happen with the Ministry&apos;s explicit authorisation. The dependency of the Assembly<lb/> administration on ministerial consent in matters of staffing is problematic. More generally, it is worth<lb/> recalling the comment in the 2012 Feasibility Study for a SAA between the EU and Kosovo that, &quot; The<lb/> financial and administrative independence of the Assembly from the Government needs to be<lb/> strengthened. This can be achieved through adopting legislation on the status of civil servants of the<lb/> Assembly. It is also important to ensure that the draft budget of the Assembly is modified by the<lb/> Government in consultation with the Assembly before the Government submits the budget proposal to<lb/> the Assembly for adoption &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3<lb/> Key policy processes and instruments<lb/> 3.3.1<lb/> Managing parliamentary business and interinstitutional relationships<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted above, the key responsibility for managing parliamentary business lies with the President of the<lb/> Assembly and the Presidency. One of their central tasks is to provide for effective timetabling of plenary<lb/> meetings during the two annual sessions, and to ensure that the time rules governing the legislative<lb/> process, the budgetary process and oversight and control procedures are adhered to. Timetabling of the<lb/> individual plenary sittings is done in consultation with the heads of parliamentary groups. The planning<lb/> of the work schedules of committees is decentralised. Committee chairpersons, working closely with<lb/> committee staff, are decisive in this respect. Both the Assembly, as a whole, and each committee adopt<lb/> an annual work plan. To a considerable extent, these work plans are reliant on the annual work plan of<lb/> the Government which, among other things, sets out the bills to be submitted during the course of the<lb/> year. For committees, a key question also to be decided is the allocation of committee time for oversight<lb/> and control, notably the organisation of field visits, oversight hearings, the consideration of annual<lb/> reports from the ministries on the implementation of laws and the detailed scrutiny of the<lb/> implementation of individual laws. In 2011, the Assembly committees considered in depth the<lb/> implementation of 11 laws; in 2012 this dropped to 7 laws.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>In the writing of this review, it was not possible to draw on data showing the percentage of the<lb/> Government&apos;s annual legislative programme that materialises in the form of bills submitted to the<lb/> Assembly. Nor was it possible to ascertain the percentage of the Government bills that had not<lb/> previously been announced in the legislative programme. Thus, it is difficult to gauge the reliability of the<lb/> legislative programme. The prevailing impression amongst interviewees was that the overall annual<lb/> legislative workload was predictably high.<lb/> However, problems of executive-legislative co-ordination affect the more detailed planning of<lb/> parliamentary activities. As noted earlier, there is no Government representative present at the<lb/> meetings of the Presidency, nor are there regular meetings at the level of the Secretary-General. There is<lb/> little co-ordination amongst the ministries when it comes to the timing of the submission of bills to the<lb/> Assembly. Thus, in 2011, 143 bills were expected to be submitted to the Assembly, but 49 were not<lb/> processed within the initially foreseen deadline. As a result, work flows for the standing committees, in<lb/> particular, can be very uneven. The lack of a key executive interlocutor, such as a Minister for Relations<lb/> with Parliament, creates problems when it comes to ensuring that parliamentary questions are answered<lb/> satisfactorily and on time. Thus, in 2012, out of the 160 parliamentary questions submitted for answering<lb/> by the Prime Minister and ministers, a quarter, 43, remained without reply.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.2<lb/> Legislation<lb/></head>

			<p>The main rules governing the legislative process are contained in the Constitution and the Assembly&apos;s<lb/> RoP. These rules specify both the institutions involved and the processes to be followed. The rules are<lb/> clear and well understood by the legislators. The parliamentary legislative process normally encompasses<lb/> two readings. In cases where a bill does not receive the sufficient number of votes for its adoption in the<lb/> second reading, a third reading may take place upon the request of the sponsor of the bill.<lb/></p>

			<p>As is customary in parliamentary systems, the legislative calendar is dominated by Government bills. In<lb/> 2012, in addition to 15 bills carried over from 2011, the Assembly dealt with 70 Government bills,<lb/> compared to just 4 bills submitted by committees and 3 bills sponsored by Deputies. In 2012, 69 bills<lb/> became law. It is interesting that seven bills were returned to the Government for redrafting, up from<lb/> two bills in 2011.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The practice of parliamentary scrutiny of bills cannot be understood without reference to the state of the<lb/> legal system in Kosovo. It is generally recognised that many important elements of the legal system still<lb/> need to be put in place. Unlike in the legal systems of fully consolidated democracies, where law making<lb/> is often dominated by amendments to existing legislation, in Kosovo there is an emphasis on the<lb/> adoption of genuinely new laws. Moreover, the adoption of this legislation is often foreseen as the result<lb/> of international commitments entered into by the Government. This means that parliamentary influence<lb/> on both substantive legislative priorities and legislative timetables is severely constrained.<lb/> Parliamentary influence is further restricted by the fact that executive-legislative co-operation during the<lb/> pre-parliamentary stages of the legislative process seems largely absent. There is no tradition of<lb/> involving experts from the majority parliamentary groups informally in the drafting of bills by the<lb/> ministries. Thus, Deputies can only try to exert influence once a bill has been submitted to the Assembly.<lb/> Notwithstanding these systemic limitations to the impact of the Assembly on the content and timing of<lb/> legislation, the Assembly is certainly taking its legislative role seriously, and devotes a considerable part<lb/> of its resources to the scrutiny of legislation. Bills are first considered by the relevant functional<lb/> committee and a &quot; vote in principle &quot; is then taken in the plenary on whether to proceed. If a decision is<lb/> taken to proceed in principle, the bill is then examined both by the relevant functional committee and<lb/> the relevant standing committees. The functional committee may take up to three months for the<lb/> consideration of a bill.</p>

			<table>Two standing committees – the Committee for Legislation and the Committee for<lb/> EI – also examine all bills, and the two other standing committees – for Budget and Finance, and for<lb/> Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns – will consider the bill if it falls into their sphere of<lb/> responsibilities.<lb/></table>

			<p>Committees establish working groups of between three and five Deputies to examine bills and the<lb/> number of meetings of working groups is high (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> above). These working group meetings are<lb/> usually attended by representatives of the ministry sponsoring the bill. Ministers typically attend the<lb/> committee meeting at which the recommendations of the working groups are discussed. During the<lb/> second reading of the bill, all amendments proposed are voted upon individually, including those of the<lb/> lead functional committee, other committees, parliamentary groups, the Government and the Deputies.<lb/> The fact that bills are invariably considered by more than one committee, and often by three or four,<lb/> combined with extensive opportunities for proposing amendments to Government bills, encourages<lb/> detailed legislative scrutiny.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The number of proposed amendments is considerable, with 1 254 in 2011 and 1 002 in 2012. Between<lb/> January and June 2013, a total of 781 amendments were proposed to 38 bills that were under<lb/> consideration. Of the amendments proposed, approximately 98% are approved. Final voting on<lb/> individual amendments and the bill as a whole takes place at the same plenary session. As a result, it can<lb/> be very difficult to deal with potential discrepancies or even contradictions between amendments.<lb/> The Assembly&apos;s RoP allows for consultation with those having affected interests and also permits the<lb/> engagement of external experts. Committee agendas are made public well in advance of committee<lb/> meetings. A manual to aid the use of external expertise in committees was produced in late 2011.<lb/> Committees conducted 68 public hearings in 2011. In 2012, this number dropped to 37. This decline<lb/> indicates time pressures in the legislative process, but also points to strains on the organisational<lb/> capacities of committees. Standing committees have an annual budget of EUR 10 000 each to pay<lb/> outside expert consultants. The equivalent figure in the case of functional committees is EUR 5 000 each.<lb/> At least as regards legislation intensive committees, these figures are low, so that committees have<lb/> repeatedly turned to external donors to finance expert advice.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The short period of time – only 10 days – available to the standing committees on Budget and Finance,<lb/> Legislation, Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns, and EI to consider amendments proposed by<lb/> functional committees is problematic. In cases where there is a high number of amendments proposed,<lb/> the standing committees find it difficult to carry out a proper assessment of the budgetary, legal and<lb/> integration related aspects of amendments.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.3<lb/> Budgeting<lb/></head>

			<p>The main powers and responsibilities of the Assembly in matters relating to the state budget are laid<lb/> down at the level of the Constitution, the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability and<lb/> the Assembly&apos;s RoP. It is useful here to distinguish between the annual procedures for the adoption of<lb/> the state budget, the consideration of the budgetary impact of bills, and the Assembly&apos;s role in oversight<lb/> and control regarding the execution of the budget. In line with the terms of reference of this review, the<lb/> focus is on the latter two issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whilst ultimate parliamentary authority in matters relating to the budget and public finances rests in the<lb/> plenary, it is the Committee for Budget and Finance where most of the detailed work takes place. As a<lb/> standing committee, this committee considers all bills with budgetary implications. As a functional<lb/> committee, it reviews legislation relating to budgeting, finance and fiscal policy. The committee also<lb/> considers the unaudited reports of the public agencies that report to it. There is a separate Committee<lb/> on Oversight of Public Finances that oversees the legality of public expenditure and works closely with<lb/> the Office of the Auditor General.<lb/></p>

			<p>In considering legislation with budgetary implications as a standing committee, the Budget and Finance<lb/> Committee operates under the same time rules that apply to other standing committees in the<lb/> legislative process, i.e. it is asked to report on the bill within 10 days during the review stage for the<lb/> detailed consideration of bills prior to the second reading. If, during this stage, other committees suggest<lb/> amendments with budgetary implications, the Budget and Finance Committee is required to respond<lb/> within five days. If the Committee serves as a functional committee, it has 15 days for reaching a position<lb/> on the adoption or non-adoption of the bill in principle, and, after the conclusion of the first reading, two<lb/> months to present a report with recommendations to the plenary (the Committee may ask the Assembly<lb/> to grant up to one month&apos;s extension).<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Like other committees, the Budget and Finance Committee establishes working groups for the<lb/> consideration of bills, with between three and five Deputies. Participants in the process criticise the<lb/> budgetary impact statements provided by the Government with draft bills as being at times incomplete<lb/> and superficial, so that the working groups have to perform their tasks within a very short time in the<lb/> case of standing committee matters, and on the basis of weak information. The working groups are<lb/> served by the administrative committee staff. Prior to the meetings, committee staff prepare preliminary<lb/> assessments on potentially problematic issues and, according to participants in the process, it is also<lb/> committee personnel who formulate the bulk of suggested amendments. In the past few years, the<lb/> committee administration benefitted from assistance by various international donors to upgrade its<lb/> capacities.<lb/> Regarding oversight and control, the Budget and Finance Committee plays a subsidiary role compared to<lb/> the Committee on Oversight of Public Finances. It receives the unaudited financial reports of agencies<lb/> and independent institutions. Committee staff provide preliminary analyses on this basis. It is not<lb/> unusual for reports to be returned to the institutions with the request for further information.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are at least two issues worth highlighting when it comes to the Assembly&apos;s role in budget related<lb/> policy making. First, its capacity for the scrutiny of bills is critically dependent on the quality of the<lb/> budgetary and financial information accompanying bills that is provided by the Government. The Budget<lb/> and Finance Committee does not have at its disposal the personnel or financial resources to carry out<lb/> systematic assessments of budgetary impacts. It is, by necessity, largely confined to checking the quality<lb/> of the information furnished by the executive.<lb/> Second, as regards its oversight role, it is not clear whether the current practice of considering unaudited<lb/> reports, whilst the Committee on Oversight of Public Finances deals with audit reports, is optimal.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.4<lb/> Oversight and control<lb/></head>

			<p>Compared to legislative work, the Assembly&apos;s activities in executive oversight and control are of a more<lb/> limited scale. The chief instruments available include: parliamentary questions, interpellations leading to<lb/> debates, examinations of the implementation of individual laws, and the consideration of reports from<lb/> executive bodies (for further details see Manual &quot; Oversight Function of Parliamentary Committees &quot; ,<lb/> 2012). The range of oversight and control instruments available is quite limited and no intensive use is<lb/> made of them (see <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Parliamentary questions to the Prime Minister and ministers for oral answers during question time are<lb/> regulated in Article 45 of the RoP. They must be submitted in writing at least 48 hours in advance, are<lb/> then posed orally in no more than two minutes, and the answer must take no more than three minutes.<lb/> A Deputy is not allowed more than two such questions per plenary session. It is evident from these<lb/> regulations that oral questions can do no more than raise very specific issues, rather than allow for a<lb/> systematic questioning of the Executive. There was a modest increase in the number of parliamentary<lb/> questions from 124 in 2011 to 160 in 2012. It is also possible to table questions for written answers<lb/> (Article 46, RoP), but this instrument is hardly ever used.<lb/> Motions of interpellation allow groups of at least six Deputies to request a debate on issues concerning<lb/> the work of the Government or an individual ministry. The RoP (Article 44) require the Prime Minister or<lb/> ministers to respond to the issues raised, and time is made available in the plenary to present the<lb/> proposers&apos; concern, for the executive to respond, and for other Deputies to join the debate. Although<lb/> the interpellation seems a suitable instrument for executive oversight, only four motions of<lb/> interpellations were debated in 2011 and 2012 each.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 11: Scrutiny activities of the Assembly 2011-2012<lb/> Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In addition to the oversight and control mechanisms employed at the level of the plenary, committees<lb/> also play a role in holding the Executive to account. The terms of reference of parliamentary committees<lb/> establish that they oversee the application of legislation falling within their respective spheres of<lb/> competence. The Assembly has adopted a practice under Article 73 of the RoP whereby each committee<lb/> should, in principle, aim to carry out an examination of the implementation of at least one major law per<lb/> year. The relevant decisions are taken as part of the discussions held on the annual committee work<lb/> plans. In 2011, 11 such examinations were carried out, and 7 were conducted in 2012. The provision<lb/> applies to both standing committees and functional committees. Thus, for example, the Budget and<lb/> Finance Committee intends to carry out two reviews in 2013, one on the Public Procurement Law and<lb/> one on the Law on Fortune Games.<lb/> The Assembly receives regular reports from budgetary organisations and independent institutions that<lb/> operate within their sphere of competence. These reports are first discussed in committee and their<lb/> review in the plenary is opened by a presentation from a committee rapporteur.<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> 30<lb/> 2010.8 2011 2011.2 2011.4 2011.6 2011.8 2012 2012.2<lb/> 0<lb/> 20<lb/> 40<lb/> 60<lb/> 80<lb/> 100<lb/> 120<lb/> 140<lb/> 160<lb/> 180<lb/> 2011<lb/> 2012<lb/> Questions submitted<lb/> Reviews of annual reports and<lb/> audit reports<lb/> Law implementation reviews<lb/> Interpellations<lb/></figure>

			<p>It is notable that the Assembly does not make use of the Investigative Committees, as provided for in<lb/> Article 71 of the RoP. Such committees can be established &quot; where the Assembly identifies an issue of<lb/> special importance &quot; and wishes &quot; to summon any official it deems necessary to testify in front of the<lb/> committee &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.5<lb/> EU integration<lb/></head>

			<p>Parliamentary responsibility for matters relating to EI is concentrated in the standing Committee for<lb/> European Integration. It reviews and supervises the process of harmonisation of laws enacted by the<lb/> Assembly with the legislation of the EU. In practice, this means that all bills considered must be<lb/> submitted to the committee which assesses the compatibility of bills with the acquis. The committee is<lb/> also tasked with maintaining close working ties with the EU institutions, EU Member States and other<lb/> actors relevant to the furtherance of Kosovo&apos;s integration process, and for monitoring and supervising<lb/> the implementation of relevant agreements. The committee also deals with Kosovo&apos;s relationship with<lb/> the Council of Europe. In addition to the working plan of the Committee, the Assembly as a whole adopts<lb/> annual &quot; Parliamentary Action Plans for European Integration &quot; , as well as regular progress reports on the<lb/> implementation of these annual action plans. The Assembly receives six monthly reports from the<lb/> Government on integration related developments.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of main challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Whilst it is evident that the Assembly attaches central importance to EI in its workings, there are several<lb/> issues relating to the operation of the Committee for EI and interinstitutional relationships that merit<lb/> further scrutiny. First, under the RoP, the Committee, as a standing committee, is only given 10 days to<lb/> check for the compliance of bills with European legislation and agreements and the obligations arising<lb/> out of Council of Europe membership. Participants in the process criticise that the declarations of<lb/> compliance accompanying Government bills cannot always be relied upon and that no proper tables of<lb/> compliance are provided. In practice, the compatibility checks of bills – and also amendments introduced<lb/> during the legislative process – fall to two of the total of four committee staff. As a consequence, in an<lb/> area where attention to legislative details is essential, time pressures are especially severe.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the overall scarcity of resources in the Assembly, including legal expertise, it seems justified to look<lb/> again at the division of labour amongst the Committee for Legislation and the Committee for EI and their<lb/> respective personnel, as well as the Unit for Legal Harmonisation and Approximation. Both committees<lb/> and their staff engage primarily in the scrutiny of compliance, with domestic and European law<lb/> respectively, as does the Unit. There seems at least an obvious case for concentrating these legal checks<lb/> into a single body served by an enlarged administrative support structure that incorporates the above<lb/> Unit.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, an artificial division appears to exist between the political responsibilities of the Committee<lb/> for European Integration, on the one hand, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the other, given<lb/> the overriding importance of the European frameworks for co-operation in Kosovo&apos;s foreign relations.<lb/> This division at the level of the Assembly mirrors the organisational division between the Ministry of EI<lb/> and the MFA at the level of the Government.<lb/> As noted above, there is, as yet, no comprehensive legal framework governing the powers and<lb/> responsibilities of the Assembly in the EU integration process. In addition, the EI Committee&apos;s role is<lb/> principally geared towards review and co-ordination rather than the initiation and formulation of<lb/> political initiatives, and towards sustaining a critical dialogue with the Government and the President in<lb/> the integration process. In particular, at present, the EI Committee and the Assembly as a whole are<lb/> largely bystanders in the negotiations with the EU. Thus far, there has been no requirement for the<lb/> Assembly&apos;s approval of the mandates of SAA negotiations and no discussion of commitments taken by<lb/> the Government prior to their adoption.<lb/></p>
