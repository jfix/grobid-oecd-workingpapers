impacted by difficulties in access to finance for business start-ups. Low-educated and young people, in particular, are 
more likely to mention financing problems as a major constraint to starting a business. Women and young entrepreneurs 
rely more on the support of family, friends and public authorities. The low educated, on the other hand, are less likely 
to receive public financing. @BULLET Traditional financing mechanisms such as grants and subsidised loans have supported in the past the self-employment 
of disadvantaged groups. However, given the current constraints to government budgets, they are expensive policy solu-
tions. New emerging financing instruments can complement the role of traditional policies, including loan guarantees, 
microcredit, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending and business angel investment. It is important that policy makers introduce 
appropriate policy actions to extend the reach of these mechanisms. @BULLET Loan guarantees have mainly been used so far by traditional small firms, but they can also play a role in supporting 
inclusive entrepreneurship. Targeted microcredit programmes are warranted to make microcredit more socially inclusive, 
as there are signs that microcredit in the EU might not be serving adequately the needs of traditional clients such as 
women and migrants. Awareness should be raised and appropriate regulations introduced to support Internet-based 
mechanisms such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. Business angel investment, while traditionally associated 
with high-impact entrepreneurship, can also positively affect the development of inclusive entrepreneurship, provided 
that appropriate adjustments are adopted. @BULLET Barriers to access to finance are not only of market nature. Supply-side interventions should be integrated by others 
aimed at upgrading the skills of disadvantaged entrepreneurs, including financial education. Financial education must be 
practice-oriented and is most likely to have an impact if its provision is integrated with the supply of finance. INTRODUCTION More than one-third of the European Union's adult population 
would rather be self-employed than an employee if given the 
chance to choose, according to the 2012 Flash Eurobarometer 
survey. At the same time, there is a large entrepreneurial poten-
tial in social groups that are either disadvantaged in the labour 
market (e.g. youth, migrants, and the low-skilled) or under-
represented in the entrepreneurial population (e.g. women and 
seniors). Inclusive entrepreneurship policies aim to give the 
opportunity for people from these groups to start-up in busi-
ness and self-employment both for economic reasons and to 
support the goal of social inclusion. One of the critical areas for policy action involves improving access 
to finance. Lack of finance is a common barrier for most new 
enterprises, which is magnified among the most disadvantaged 
and under-represented groups (with the exception of senior entre-
preneurs), reflecting in large part the relative lack of collateral 
assets and own financial resources in these groups. Some of these 
groups may additionally face social discrimination in credit mar-
kets. Policies and programmes that favour access to finance for 
disadvantaged or underrepresented entrepreneurs have, therefore, 
both a social and economic dimension. They help beneficiaries 
to integrate in the labour market through an income-generating 
activity either in the form of a start-up or through increased 
employability. The ultimate goal of interventions should be that 
everyone, irrespective of sex, age or ethnic background, has access 
to business financing tools available in the market. Inclusive financing programmes should be flexible to accom-
modate for the different, sometimes unconventional, types of business that disadvantaged entrepreneurs run. Women may 
start a business and strive to reconcile work and family, thus 
spending less time at work than the average entrepreneur. They 
may also need to run a business from home, something which 
also applies to entrepreneurs with physical disabilities. Migrants 
often combine different activities together to guarantee their 
livelihood, with the physical and legal boundaries between 
different activities not always clear. Financing schemes for 
inclusive entrepreneurship should adapt to these peculiarities 
because they reflect some of the barriers that prevent female, 
disabled and migrant entrepreneurs from access to traditional 
sources of enterprise finance. New sets of finance products have emerged in the market 
that can serve the needs of disadvantaged entrepreneurs. 
This policy brief focuses on these new tools, which offer a 
more sustainable approach than traditional grants to finance 
inclusive entrepreneurship. Some of these instruments (e.g. 
crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending) use the power of the 
Internet to shorten the distance between lenders and borrow-
ers and wipe out possible discrimination effects. Others (e.g. 
loan guarantees, microcredit, alternative debt finance, and 
business angels) address market failures that are more likely 
to affect entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups. Still oth-
ers by-pass the market to rely on forms of self-support (e.g. 
self-financing groups) or try to dovetail market rules with moral 
principles (e.g. Islamic finance). Supply-side interventions need 
to be combined with financial education to improve the financial 
literacy skills of disadvantaged entrepreneurs. In the case of 
our target groups, barriers to access to finance are in fact not 4 only of market nature, but also involve limited understanding of 
the credit market (e.g. loan application process, interest rates, 
time value of money, etc.). The policy brief proceeds as follow. First, data on access to 
finance by women, young and low-educated entrepreneurs 
are presented to give an overview of the challenge facing 
policy makers who want to promote access to finance for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Second, the main types of 
barriers in access to finance for these target groups are 
discussed. Third, policies to finance inclusive entrepreneur-
ship are discussed at length. The focus is mainly on emerging 
mechanisms, with an emphasis also on operational aspects 
that can help policy makers to introduce these schemes. 
Conclusions restate the main findings and policy recom-
mendations of the brief. THE SCALE AND NATURE OF THE FINANCING CHALLENGE External finance as a start-up barrier Survey evidence from across the European Union indicates 
that obtaining external finance is a major barrier to business 
start-up across all socio-demographic groups (Figure 1). (1) 
More than one-half of new entrepreneurs across all groups 
consider obtaining finance to be an important problem, the 
only exceptions being entrepreneurs aged above 40 and those 
with post-secondary education. The low-educated and young 
entrepreneurs have the greatest problems in this respect. More 
men than women entrepreneurs report obtaining financing as ( 1 ) 
One of the best sources of data on access to finance by socio-
demographic groups is the EUROSTAT Factors of Business Success 
(FOBS) survey, which was unfortunately conducted only in 2005 on 
business founders from 15 EU countries participating on a voluntary 
basis. The survey covered enterprises born in 2002, that had survived 
to 2005, and that were still managed by the founder at the time of the 
survey. It covered Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, 
France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia and Sweden. Dating back to 2005, the survey does not take 
into account the consequences of the global economic crisis (2008) 
and of the largest EU enlargement to Eastern Europe (2004). having been a major problem in the start-up phase, although 
the difference is minimal. This possibly reflects the nature of 
the enterprises women tend to start. Women entrepreneurs 
are disproportionally present in the services sector, which has 
lower entry costs, and are more likely to start a business driven 
by the need to combine family and work (OECD, 2012). Thus, 
women entrepreneurs have lower financial needs on average 
than male entrepreneurs. On the other hand, there is evidence 
of undercapitalisation of many women-owned businesses, and 
greater reliance on bootstrapping and short-term loans, which 
tend to increase vulnerability to bankruptcy (OECD, 2012). (2) ( 2 ) 
Bootstrapping can be defined as the use of internal sources to meet the 
resource needs of a business without relying on external finance. This 
includes minimisation of accounts receivable, joint utilisation of machinery, 
delaying payments, and minimisation of capital invested in stocks. Figure 1. Percentage of entrepreneurs reporting 'obtaining finance' as a major start-up difficulty

up across different socio-demographic groups. The 3Fs of founder, 
family and friends are the main source of start-up finance for all 
groups. However, thanks to greater savings or possibly greater risk 
propensity, male, older and higher-educated entrepreneurs are more 
likely than others to draw on their own personal resources to set up a 
business activity. This is confirmed by a country-based examination 
of  " nascent entrepreneurs "  (Figure 3), (3) which shows how in most EU 
countries senior nascent entrepreneurs are more likely than junior 
nascent entrepreneurs to expect financing their business without 
any external contribution. The median value for nascent entrepre-
neurs that foresee to fully self-finance their business is 53% for 
senior entrepreneurs (Italy), but only 38% for young entrepreneurs 
(Slovenia). With respect to women and low-educated entrepreneurs, 
the median value stands respectively at 51% (Finland) and 45% 
(Greece). Given the overwhelming role that personal resources play 
in the financing of start-ups, this enables men and older people 
to get more easily involved in entrepreneurship and develop stur-
dier businesses. At the same time, this signals a problem for other 
groups, which tend to be forced to make greater use of  " financial 
assistance from family and friends " . Women and young people and, 
to a lesser extent, low-educated entrepreneurs, are more likely than 
others to resort to this source of start-up finance (Figure 2). Apart from use of own funds and funds from family and friends, 
the main sources of funding are bank loans, public authorities, 
capital contributions from other enterprises and venture capital ( 3 ) 
Based on the definition of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, 
nascent entrepreneurs are people actively involved in setting up a 
business they will own or co-own. (Figure 2). Access to these sources can be vital to the ability of 
entrepreneurs to make the necessary start-up investments and 
to cover operating costs until revenues flow in. However, there 
are important differences across socio-demographic groups in 
their abilities to access external funding sources. For example, male entrepreneurs are more likely than female entre-
preneurs to use bank loans to fuel the start-up process. Interestingly, 
the gender gap is bigger for uncollateralised loans than for collater-
alised loans. On the other hand, the level of education is not a strong 
determinant of access to loans. Business founders with primary and 
lower secondary education are those more likely to have used both 
uncollateralised and collateralised loans to launch an enterprise. Other financial sources are less important on average. However, 
public financial support has made a contribution to business start-up 
by a significant group of entrepreneurs. Women and youth are the 
categories of entrepreneurs most likely to be targeted by public 
financial support. Results on levels of education are again not as 
straightforward as for sex and age, with entrepreneurs with upper 
secondary and tertiary education more likely to receive financial aid. 
One explanation could lie in the better ability of higher-educated 
entrepreneurs to disentangle themselves in the twists and turns of 
the bureaucracy involving access to public financial support.  " Access to venture capital "  gives very similar results. Male, senior 
and higher-educated entrepreneurs report considerably more often 
than the others the use of venture capital to set out a business, 
although the percentages remain small across all social groups. Figure 2. Sources of start-up finance across socio-demographic groups in 15 EU countries, 2005 Percentage of entrepreneurs using specific sources of finance for business start-ups (multiple answers possible) 0

85.4 Source: OECD based on EUROSTAT FOBS, 2005. 6 Figure 3 looks at the financing issue from another point of view, 
namely the proportion of people who fully self-finance their busi-
ness start. The graph shows that a substantial minority of people 
start up their business using entirely their own funding in all coun-
tries, but that self-funding tends to be higher in certain countries 
like the Netherlands and Denmark than others such as Austria, 
Latvia and Romania. However, the interpretation is complicated by 
the fact that two separate issues are likely to be in play. On the one 
hand, people with substantial own resources may decide to finance 
themselves rather than seek external finance. On the other hand, 
people who are refused external finance, or are discouraged from 
seeking it, will be forced to use their own resources even though this may constrain the development of their business. In terms 
of specific target groups, seniors used self-financing more than 
youth in fourteen of the nineteen countries. This is likely to reflect 
the greater resources available to seniors. In northern European 
economies such as Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, 
a very large proportion of women fully self-finance their business 
start-up, which may be the result either of sufficient personal sav-
ings or of lower capital needs required by the business they set out 
(e.g. part time business or in low-cost services), whereas in eastern 
and southern European countries the proportion of self-sufficient 
women entrepreneurs is lower, pointing to limited personal savings 
possibly due to lower participation in the labour market. Figure 3. Self-financed nascent entrepreneurs across socio-demographic groups in selected EU countries, 2007-2010 Proportion of nascent entrepreneurs who expect to fully self-finance their business start-up 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 U K

in the use of start-up loans by entrepreneurs from disadvan-
taged and under-represented groups. The highest proportions 
of loan beneficiaries are in Denmark and Austria, where the 
percentages of women, youth and low-educated people receiv-
ing bank loans to set out an enterprise were much higher than 
those in, for example, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. Wide national differences point to the importance of targeted 
approaches to financing inclusive entrepreneurship. Since Eastern 
Europe does worse than Western Europe, there is scope for using 
the European Social Fund to make strides in strengthening inclu-
sive entrepreneurship. It may well be possible that within-country differences are deeper than cross-country ones, which would sug-
gest the need for a place-based approach where regional authori-
ties design bespoke programmes to enhance access to finance by 
social target groups and where national programmes are flexible 
enough to be tailored to different local economic contexts. EU western countries should also take action. National compar-
ative data on resort to start-up loans would show that women, 
young, and low-educated entrepreneurs perform worse than 
male, senior and high-educated entrepreneurs also in the west 
of the EU (Austria, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and 
Sweden). In fact, across the whole range of FOBS-surveyed 
countries, the biggest gender gap (47.3% for men vs. 38.9% for 
women) and the biggest age gap (28.8% for senior vs. 20.3% 
for young) were respectively found in Denmark and Italy. 7 Figure 4. Use of bank start-up loans by groups across selected EU countries, 2005 Percentage of respondents using bank loans for starting up a business 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Sweden

15 Source: OECD based on EUROSTAT FOBS, 2005. Market exit due to problems 
in obtaining finance Problems in obtaining external finance are one of the possible 
reasons for entrepreneurs to exit the market. Its importance 
has increased following the 2008 global economic crisis and 
the 2011 sovereign debt crisis that have resulted in a credit 
crunch forcing many entrepreneurs to shut down their business 
(see Box 2). Figure 5, based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 
(GEM) data, confirms, but to a lower extent, the divide between 
Eastern and Western Europe with respect to access to finance 
for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Since GEM data are more 
recent than FOBS data, this might signal that the east-west 
gap is being bridged. With respect to gender, Hungary is the country where the 
highest share of women ex-entrepreneurs reports problems 
in obtaining finance as having been the most important reason 
for exit (40.2%), although the proportion for men is also high 
(37.4%). (4) Best performers are Sweden and the UK, where 
only 1.9% and 3.6% of female respondents mentioned lack 
of external finance as the main reason to close their business. 
Positive situations are also found in Eastern Europe. The Czech 
Republic and Slovakia, for example, do better than France, 
Spain or Belgium. Within-country gaps are also important. In the case of gender, 
women are less likely to search for external finance and are ( 4 ) 
The perception of a generally tight credit market in Hungary is 
corroborated also by the other socio-demographic variables taken into 
consideration in this section. therefore expected to report less than men lack of finance as 
the most important reason for business exit. GEM data confirm 
this assumption and show that in most countries male entre-
preneurs are more likely than female entrepreneurs to report 
problems in obtaining finance as the main reason for business 
closure. Countries with the biggest gender gap (i.e. women 
showing higher rates) are Estonia (above 5 percentage points) 
and Hungary (nearly 3 percentage points). The age variable confirms that some eastern European coun-
tries have made strides in providing disadvantaged entrepre-
neurs with better access to credit. After the UK (7%), Slovakia 
(7.8%) and Poland (9.1%) are the countries where the smallest 
proportions of young ex-entrepreneurs (aged 18-29) report lack 
of finance as the main reason to have closed their business. 
Slovenia (34.6%) and the Netherlands (31.8%) are the coun-
tries where the highest percentages of young entrepreneurs 
have decided to exit the market due to lack of finance. The 
two are also the countries where the highest within-country 
gaps between young and older entrepreneurs (aged 40-64) 
are observed: 25.8 percentage points in the Netherlands and 
17.4 percentage points in Slovenia. The east-west divide in the EU is stronger when one looks at 
reasons for exit among low-educated entrepreneurs (primary 
degree or less), although Croatia and Slovakia are exceptions. As 
much as 50% of Latvian and 46.8% of Hungarian low-educated 
entrepreneurs have exited the market mainly due to problems in 
obtaining finance, while the corresponding proportion is as low 
as 3% and 5% in Finland and Ireland. Within-country education 
gaps show that the low-educated face comparatively worse 8 conditions in Eastern Europe. The gap between the proportion 
of low-educated and high-educated (post-secondary degree) 
ex-entrepreneurs who report lack of external finance as the 
principal motivation to have closed their business is 27.9 per-
centage points in Latvia and 13.6 percentage points in Poland. 
In some countries such as Spain and France, however, the trend 
is reversed, thus confirming that the entrepreneur's level of edu-
cation is not always a strong determinant of access to finance. To wrap up, there is much heterogeneity across countries and 
socio-demographic groups. Some countries in Eastern Europe do better than others in the region or even in Western Europe. 
However, low-educated entrepreneurs are still faced with generally 
adverse conditions in most of Eastern Europe. This signals a policy 
priority area for the entire region. In Western Europe the group that 
needs most attention is the youth. The situation is very negative in 
the Netherlands, possibly because of the effects of the crisis, but 
large countries such as France, Italy and Spain also see the youth 
at a disadvantage when looking for finance to save their business. 
On the other hand, in these countries low-educated entrepreneurs 
are not more likely than high-educated entrepreneurs to report lack 
of finance as the main reason to close their business. Figure 5. Problems in obtaining finance as the most important reason for business exit across selected

EU average is not weighted by country population. 9 Box 1 The impact of the crisis and new banking regulations The economic crisis has dragged on in Europe since 2008, firstly through the failure and retrenchment of financial institutions 
and then because of the sovereign debt crisis. The crisis has had a severe impact on small business financing. Loan rejections at 
EU-27 aggregate level rose from 12% to 18% between the first and second half of 2009 and then fell back to 11% in 2010 and 
2011. Loan terms for small firms also worsened comparatively to large firms, and the interest rate spread between SMEs and 
large enterprises widened (OECD, 2012). The crisis has had a disproportionate impact on SMEs in southern Europe and Ireland. Between 2007 and 2010 there was a 
drop in fully successful loan applications by SMEs from 97% to 53% in Ireland, from 87% to 59% in Spain and from 88% 
to 60% in Greece (Eurostat, 2011). The outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in summer 2011 is likely to have made access 
to SME loans even more difficult, and SMEs in Greece, Portugal and Italy reported strong increases in their need for bank 
loans over the period from October 2012 to March 2013 (ECB, 2013). In addition to suffering a credit crunch, SMEs in southern Europe and Ireland have also experienced a deterioration of credit 
conditions. Between 2010 and 2011, both the average SME interest rate and the interest rate spread between loans for 
SMEs and loans for large firms increased in Ireland, Spain and Italy. In Portugal, the interest rate spread marginally decreased 
only because the average interest rate for large companies augmented comparatively more than the average SME interest 
rate, which nonetheless rose by over 1% (OECD, forthcoming). The crisis also seems to be having an impact on the inflow of new entrepreneurs. The Flash Eurobarometer surveys show 
that lack of available financial support was considered a difficulty to business start-up by 79% of EU-27 respondents in 
2012, 4 percentage points higher than in 2007 (75%), although this had dropped by 2 percentage points from the peak in 
2009 (81%). The biggest toll on entrepreneurship activity appears to be in those countries hit hardest by the crisis (Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal), while others (Germany and Finland) have advanced well along the road to recovery. Figure 6. Lack of financial support is a barrier to start-up Percentage of respondents who agree 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 % Greece

– commonly known as Basel III – which could have an impact on access to debt finance for new start-up enterprises. While 
the entire reform will become fully operational only in 2019 and it cannot be predicted how banks will react to increased 
capital requirements, there are two issues which will need to be monitored. First, the banks' ratio of core Tier-1 capital (common equity and retained earnings) to risk-weighted assets will increase from 
2% to 7%, with a counter-cyclical buffer of 0%-2.5% that can be added at a national level if the country's macroeconomic 
conditions require it. Second, for most banks the risk of assets will be assessed by standard external credit ratings that 
typically provide a risk weight of 75%-100% for business loans versus a credit risk of 20% for AAA to AA-rated products 
and 50% for A+ to A-rated products such as sovereign debt and inter-bank claims (OECD, 2012). These reforms, which are 
aimed at strengthening the resilience of the financial system, could reduce the willingness of banks to advance loans for new 
business start-ups and may call for a public policy response such as through increasing credit guarantees and microcredit. Source: EC (2010, 2012, 2013a); OECD (2012a; forthcoming); ECB (2013). 10 BARRIERS TO OBTAINING FINANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED 
AND UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP The barriers that make access to finance difficult for entre-
preneurs from social inclusion target groups fall in four main 
areas: market barriers, cultural barriers, skills barriers and 
institutional barriers: Market barriers. Credit markets suffer from information asym-
metries between lenders and borrowers. Often, banks do not 
have sufficient information to judge the viability of business 
proposals, especially in the case of new firms. Thus, they pro-
vide credit against the provision of collateral that can be seized 
in the case of loan defaults (i.e. asset-based lending). Since 
members of disadvantaged and under-represented groups in 
entrepreneurship tend to own fewer collateral assets (e.g. real 
estate property, vehicles, etc.), their loan requests are more 
likely to be rejected. There is also evidence that banks supply 
more finance to people with large personal wealth (Avery et 
al., 1998), which further penalises women, young and ethnic-
minority entrepreneurs. In principle, banks could apply higher 
interest rates to compensate for the higher risk-profile of disad-
vantaged entrepreneurs. However, such a strategy would attract 
risk-prone borrowers, leading to adverse selection. Borrowers 
might also be induced into riskier projects to pay back larger 
loan instalments, which would also result in higher chances of 
loan defaults (i.e. moral hazard). The result of these market 
failures is to prevent equal access to finance by entrepreneurs 
from socially excluded populations. Cultural barriers. Bank loan officers are trained to deal with 
a type of business in which the entrepreneur works full-time. 
Migrant entrepreneurs who manage different businesses at 
the same time or women entrepreneurs working part-time 
in their enterprise may be credit-rationed because they fall 
out of this prototype of client. Cases of social discrimination 
towards ethnic minority or female entrepreneurs are also pos-
sible, although there is not strong evidence of this in EU credit 
markets (OECD/EC, 2013). Cultural barriers also occur on the 
demand side of credit markets. Migrant and ethnic minority 
entrepreneurs may face language and social barriers to building 
a close and confident relationship with banks. Some groups, 
for example, may be unwilling to share full information on 
personal revenues and indebtedness with loan officers, who are 
perceived as outsiders. Women and youth may not approach banks because they think that on average female and young 
entrepreneurs are less likely to obtain a loan than male and 
senior entrepreneurs, thus turning into  " discouraged borrowers "  
(Kon and Storey, 2003). This is especially true when members 
of these groups have experienced prolonged periods of labour 
market inactivity. Skills barriers. Most loan applications are rejected because the 
information submitted is incomplete or wrong. This happens 
more often for entrepreneurs that do not belong to the male 
white mainstream group. Three common skills barriers involve 
business planning, business management and financial literacy. 
Many of the people from disadvantaged and under-represented 
groups in entrepreneurship who first approach external sup-
pliers of finance have never developed a business plan and 
have never managed an enterprise before, whereas these are 
common requirements of lending institutions to give credit. 
Members of some social target groups (such as low-educated, 
migrant and senior entrepreneurs) may also lack a good grasp 
of business finance concepts that are key to understanding 
the risks and opportunities associated with an entrepreneurial 
venture (e.g. interest rates, time value of money, etc.). Skills 
barriers can be addressed through business advice, mentoring 
schemes and financial education programmes. Institutional barriers. There are a number of potential problems 
in the way that finance institutions operate that can affect entre-
preneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups. 
For example, some forms of microcredit do not enable ben-
eficiaries to build a credit history, which could eventually help 
them to obtain loans from senior lending institutions at lower 
interest rates than those offered in the microfinance sector. Lack 
of legislation about new sources of finance relevant to disad-
vantaged entrepreneurs is another example of an institutional 
barrier. The diffusion of the Internet has made new sources of 
finance possible (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending), 
but only recently have policy makers started to legislate on these 
new channels of business finance. Furthermore, it is generally 
not enough to enforce a law or introduce a new programme 
to improve the provision of finance, but it is also important to 
inform would-be beneficiaries about the change. Information and 
awareness-raising initiatives are key to overcoming this barrier. TRADITIONAL POLICIES FOR FINANCING BUSINESS 
START-UP BY EXCLUDED GROUPS Given the difficulties people from disadvantaged and under-
represented groups in entrepreneurship face in obtaining 
finance for business start-ups, governments and develop-
ment agencies have traditionally provided support to correct or compensate for the finance gap. The commonly employed 
tools have been grants and soft loans. These remain highly 
relevant today and can work together with or in place of some 
of the new financing mechanisms that are beginning to emerge. 11 Grants and income subsidies Grants and income subsidies are capital transfers by which 
money ownership is transferred from one party (i.e. the gran-
tor) to another (i.e. the grantee). It is not uncommon for public 
programmes to transfer grants and subsidies under certain con-
ditions, for example with respect to the final use of the grant. 
Conditionalities are set to prevent misuse of public resources. Grants and subsidies have traditionally been used by policy 
makers to help deprived groups to integrate or re-integrate 
in the labour market (e.g. job creation schemes and wage 
subsidies). More recently, they have also been employed to 
stimulate entrepreneurial activity. The best known example of 
an income-subsidy policy for nascent entrepreneurs is from 
Germany, which since the mid-1980s has experimented with 
schemes that foster business creation among the unemployed. Box 2 Germany's New Start-Up Subsidy Target Group: People eligible for unemployment benefits under Germany's federal legislation. Intervention type: Income-subsidy policy, combined with additional support services such as business planning and coaching. 
It provides an income subsidy (i.e. the unemployment benefit) and a small grant to secure the livelihood of the unemployed 
person starting a business and partly overcome the capital constraints associated with the start-up phase. Objectives: Help unemployed people to enter the labour market via self-employment. It is especially conceived for those 
groups that are faced with discrimination in the labour market or whose skills and competencies suffer from low demand, 
as well as for regions and industries undergoing structural change. Entry requirements: Being eligible for unemployment benefits under German federal legislation and approval of a business 
plan by an external source (e.g. Chambers of Commerce). Programme length: 9 months. Description: The new Start-Up Subsidy (New SUS) was created in 2006 to merge the two previous programmes targeting 
self-employment by the unemployed in Germany: the Bridging Allowance and the Start-up Subsidy. It provides the unem-
ployed with the benefit she or he would otherwise be eligible for over the first 9 months of the start-up phase. A monthly 
lump sum of EUR 300 is also transferred for the same time period to cover social contribution requirements; the latter can 
also be extended for another 6 months. Results achieved: Robust evaluation results are available for the former Bridging Allowance, which was subsequently 
merged into the new Start-Up Subsidy with a very similar design. By comparing the performance of participants with non-
participants eligible for the programme, the evaluation points to positive income and employment effects especially for 
the low-educated, the youth and women, reaching the conclusion that the approach is more effective for groups that are 
disadvantaged in the labour market or in areas where opportunities for wage employment are scarce. The evaluation study 
also shows that businesses created by the unemployed are not necessarily structurally weak. Even after 5 years from the 
intervention, as many as 70% of male participants in East Germany and 68% of those in West Germany were still in business, 
while the lowest survival rate was for women participants in East Germany (56%). Between 30-40% of business founders 
also created additional jobs beyond their own. Lessons for other initiatives: Unemployment benefits can be used to subsidise self-employment by the unemployed, 
provided that the right set of incentives for the unemployed is in place. For example, social security contributions may have 
to be paid on top of the subsidy, which should be given on a monthly basis rather than as a lump sum. Similar schemes also 
work better for members of social groups that are discriminated in labour markets or in regions where wage employment 
opportunities are scarce. Source: Caliendo, 2013; Caliendo et al., 2012; Caliendo and Künn, 2011. Soft loans While not every entrepreneur applies for a bank loan, there 
are many that do and whose request is rejected. This is 
where government may intervene by targeting loans on 
to people who would otherwise find it difficult to obtain 
them, but who nonetheless have a viable business project 
(or one that can be made viable with complementary policy support). At the policy level many EU countries have intro-
duced subsidised loan schemes. An example is so-called 
 " Honour Loans " , which have provided many generations of 
young and female entrepreneurs in Italy and France with 
a combination of grants and interest-free loans. Honour 
loans are called so because they are conceded against the 
borrower's word of honour, without requiring collaterals or 
other forms of guarantee. 12 NEW AND EMERGING POLICY ACTIONS FOR FINANCING 
BUSINESS START-UPS IN SOCIAL INCLUSION TARGET GROUPS New financing mechanisms have recently emerged that can 
help bridge the gap between lenders and investors, on the one 
hand, and disadvantaged entrepreneurs, on the other. Some 
(e.g. loan guarantees, business angels and Islamic finance), 
have long been in place, but their potential for inclusive entre-
preneurship has not yet been fully tapped. Others (e.g. micro-
credit and self-financing groups) are relatively new but with 
a certain tradition in the policy area of financing inclusive 
entrepreneurship. Still others have only recently arisen thanks 
to the diffusion of the Internet (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-
to-peer lending). Loan guarantees Loan guarantees tackle market barriers such as the lack of 
collateral assets and higher risk profile of new and small enter-
prises. Loan guarantees have received increasing attention by 
governments because of their advantages relative to traditional 
loans and grants, namely the fact that they leverage private 
sector know-how and resources through the banks participat-
ing in the programme to favour the access of disadvantaged 
entrepreneurs to traditional sources of debt finance. The main 
driver of banks' participation in this policy is the lower credit 
risk associated with publicly-or privately-guaranteed loans. There are three main different models of loan guarantee pro-
grammes, often called also credit guarantee schemes (CGSs): 
public, public-private and mutual (OECD, forthcoming). @BULLET Public schemes: they can be either managed directly by the 
government or implemented in a more decentralised man-
ner via the banking system. The first approach, which is 
more common of Eastern Europe (Slovenia and Slovakia), 
tends to see a stronger involvement of government agen-
cies in the decision-making process about the provision of 
the loan guarantee. The second approach, shared by the 
United Kingdom and the Netherlands, is implemented via 
the banking sector with little if any direction on how the 
guarantee scheme is managed and for which loans the public 
guarantee is used. @BULLET Public-private schemes: they involve both public and pri-
vate sector players. The government's role can be more or 
less active, for example in facilitating the creation of the 
programme. Irrespective of the degree of public sector 
involvement, the management of the programme (e.g. risk 
assessment and monitoring of the loan) is left to the lending institutions. An example of more active involvement is given 
by the Hungarian government, which sought the involvement 
of both lending institutions and SME associations when it 
launched its national guarantee Fund. @BULLET Private schemes: they see the strongest commitment by 
the private sector, generally through bottom-up mutual 
guarantee associations that group entrepreneurs from the 
same local business community (e.g. Italy) or from the same 
industry (e.g. Spain). In this type of CGS, it is the mutual 
guarantee associations that provide a first assessment of 
the member who intends to borrow and that are involved in 
the recovery of losses in case of default. The final lending 
choice, nonetheless, remains with the bank, which carries out 
its own full credit risk assessment. The role of the govern-
ment is limited to setting the regulatory and legal framework 
and supplying financial assistance, which can take the form 
of direct funding or counter-guarantees. An example of pri-
vate CGS is Italy, where the government provides a sizeable 
last-resort counter-guarantee to banks on top of first-level 
guarantees offered by local mutual guarantee associations 
(i.e. called confidi in Italy). A key characteristic of loan guarantee programmes is that 
the final lending choice is left with banks because they 
still carry a part of the risk of default, generally anything 
between 20% and 50% of the loan amount. The risk profile 
of guarantee-backed loans will not therefore diverge too 
much from the bank's average client risk profile. As a result, 
disadvantaged entrepreneurs are at risk of being left out of 
mainstream CGSs. If the government is to use CGSs to encourage inclusive entre-
preneurship, its role should thus go beyond setting the legal 
framework and giving counter-guarantees. Guarantee pro-
grammes exclusively designed for entrepreneurs from target 
groups (e.g. young, women, ethnic minorities) are an option, 
as is the encouragement through public subsidies (e.g. con-
tributions to the registered capital, payments for the running 
costs of the association, etc.) of mutual guarantee associations 
among members of target groups working in similar sectors. 
In both cases, governments should rely on the expertise of 
private sector lending institutions for credit risk assessment. 
Lenders, on their part, should continue to carry a small part of 
the default risk (e.g. 10-20%), so that they have an incentive 
to apply due diligence in the assessment of loan applications. 
Maximum default rates should be set beforehand to make CGSs 
financially sustainable for public finances. 13 Box 3 Key criteria in setting up a loan guarantee programme for disadvantaged entrepreneurs Different operational parameters need to be considered by policy makers interested in setting up credit guarantee schemes 
for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Firm eligibility: the main eligibility criterion would be affinity to the target group. An age threshold of 3-5 years can also 
be included to ensure that the programme caters for new entrepreneurs. A size limit can equally be applied to increase the 
additionality of the programme, since larger SMEs should be able to obtain credit via traditional credit channels. Guarantee assignment process: guarantees can be assigned mainly on a retail or portfolio basis. In the first case, credit risk 
assessment is done on a personal basis, which implies in-depth knowledge of borrowers but also higher administrative costs. 
In the second case, guarantees are provided based on some common characteristics of applicants (e.g. sector, locality, etc.). Coverage ratio: it expresses the degree of protection over defaulted loans provided to lending institutions and can range 
anywhere between 20% and 100%. Even in the case of disadvantaged entrepreneurs it is, however, recommended that a 
coverage ratio above 90% is not enforced, since this will reduce the incentive for lending institutions to carry out a proper 
credit risk assessment. The EU State Aid Framework sets an 80% coverage ratio when public funding is involved in the 
guarantee coverage, although this threshold has been increased during the crisis up to 90%. A median coverage ratio of 80% 
was also found in a survey of 76 schemes worldwide (Beck et al., 2010). A coverage ratio between 80% and 90% could be 
envisaged for our target groups, depending on the hardships they are faced with and evolution of EU State Aid legislation. Average guarantee period: it is often below 5 years and hardly ever above 10 years. In the case of new businesses, policy 
makers should acknowledge that the risk associated with start-up loans tend to decrease over time, so long guarantee 
periods should not be the norm (i.e. less than 5 years). In principle, borrowers who have proven to be reliable or who have 
meanwhile acquired collaterals should be phased out and turned to traditional credit channels. Pricing: CGSs typically generate revenues by applying entry fees, annual fees and loan guarantee application fees. Given 
the restrained personal resources of disadvantaged entrepreneurs, policy makers should envisage a strong subsidisation 
element to encourage applications and enrolment into programmes by target groups. Additional services: CGS for entrepreneurs unable to receive credit through commercial channels should finally consider 
matching the supply of credit with additional services, such as financial education (see below), to increase the likelihood 
of repayment. The following summary provides an overview of what a loan guarantee programme for disadvantaged entrepreneurs could 
resemble to: @BULLET Entrepreneur eligibility: Based on affinity to target groups and credit worthiness. @BULLET Assignment process: Retail or portfolio-based. @BULLET Coverage ratio: High, 80%-90% of the loan amount, but in line with EU legislation. @BULLET Average guarantee period: Less than 5 years. @BULLET Pricing: Strong subsidy component should be envisaged. @BULLET Additional services: Financial education and business development advice to boost chances of repayment. Loan guarantee programmes have several advantages from 
a government point of view. They leverage on the expertise 
of the banking sector for credit risk assessment, which lowers 
the risks of government failures. Their cost is in large part pro-
portional to the loan default rate, so that if the programme is 
run properly it will be a low-cost policy option (although large 
funds will have to be set aside to cover for possible defaults 
and convince banks to participate). They favour the integration 
of marginal groups into the mainstream credit system and show 
to commercial banks that disadvantaged entrepreneurs can 
be profitable clients. On the downside, CGSs have traditionally 
been conceived for the average small firm, so that their use by 
disadvantaged entrepreneurs requires some tweaks. Moreover, 
if the default risk is not fairly shared among the parties, the 
scheme lends itself to opportunistic behaviours by lenders 
and borrowers. Finally, public schemes where the government 
plays an active role in the monitoring and assessment of loan guarantees present higher operating costs and are subject to 
picking-winner problems. The pros and cons of loan guarantee programmes are con-
firmed by existing empirical evidence. Loan guarantees have 
been found to improve credit conditions for SMEs (e.g. the size, 
maturity and interest rates of the loans), but the evidence for 
an impact on increasing the number of loan beneficiaries and 
business start-ups is less conclusive. In France, the guarantee 
programme operated by OSEO, the government SME financing 
agency, throughout the 1990s resulted in increased loan vol-
umes and sales growth for the beneficiaries, but did not affect 
the overall start-up rate in the economy (Lelarge et al., 2010). 
Since then, OSEO has recalibrated the scheme towards the 
needs of start-ups, which came to represent 75% of the ben-
eficiary firms and 35% of total funding in 2011 (OECD, 2013). 
A series of studies on the Italian loan guarantee system also 14 suggest that the impact of loan guarantee policy is stronger 
on credit conditions than on credit expansion (Columba et al, 
2010; D'Ignazio and Menon, 2013). In Italy, the schemes have 
lowered interest rates, lengthened loan maturity and increased 
loan volumes, but they have not favoured the creation of new 
firms. In addition, the positive effect of affiliation to a mutual 
guarantee scheme has been larger for those firms with shorter 
lending relationships with banks. In the United Kingdom, on 
the other hand, participation in the national Small Firm Loan 
Guarantee Scheme has made beneficiary firms more likely 
to export and hire new workers than similar non-borrowing 
firms (Cowling, 2010). Moreover, ethnic minority businesses 
and businesses located in disadvantaged areas have been over-
represented in this scheme, which has therefore strengthened 
inclusive entrepreneurship in the country. The European Commission supports loan guarantee pro-
grammes through the Joint European Resources for Micro to 
Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative. Policy makers can use 
EU structural funds to invest in revolving financing instruments 
such as venture capital, loan or guarantee funds that promote, 
among other things, the creation of new businesses. One of the 
main benefits of the JEREMIE initiative is its portfolio-based 
approach. National and regional Funds can allocate JEREMIE 
resources to instruments with different risk profiles, thus 
spreading risk across the portfolio of instruments, although 
JEREMIE also requires national and local Funds to be able to 
generate revenues out of the whole range of products and 
become self-sustainable. This leaves policy makers with some 
room for introducing relatively riskier products such as CGSs for 
disadvantaged entrepreneurs, which can eventually be cross-
subsidised by safer products generating stronger revenues. Microcredit Microcredit aims to tackle market barriers and cultural barri-
ers at the same time, for commercial banks lend against the 
provision of collateral and with a type of business in mind 
that does not necessarily fit the one run by migrants, women 
or young entrepreneurs. If combined with financial education 
and business advice, microcredit can address skills barriers in 
access to finance as well. In the European Union microcredit refers to loans of less than 
EUR 25 000 for micro-enterprises employing less than 10 employ-
ees, self-employed or unemployed and inactive people who want to move into self-employment but do not have access to tra-
ditional banking services (EIF, 2009). Microcredit first emerged 
in developing countries and reached Europe only more recently. 
The first microfinance institutions (MFIs) date back to the 1980s 
in Eastern Europe and to the 2000s in Western Europe. (5) This 
different timing has led to a divide in the EU microcredit model. 
In eastern countries, for-profit organisations and credit unions 
dominate the sector, whereas in western countries the market 
mainly consists of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and 
non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs). With respect to the services offer, most MFIs combine credit 
with business support and other financial services (e.g. con-
sumer credit, insurances, etc.); only between 25%-30% of 
European MFIs implement microcredit without additional sup-
port services (Underwood, 2006; EMN, 2010). The business 
model of MFIs, therefore, relies on a combined product offer, 
higher-than-average interest rates, and loan application fees. 
Nonetheless, the sector still largely depends on public support 
to cover both operational costs and the loan capital, as shown 
by the 63% average repayment ratio of the EMN-surveyed 
MFIs (EMN, 2010). (6) Disadvantaged and underrepresented entrepreneurs are impor-
tant targets of MFIs, but less than it could be expected. Of 
the 170 microcredit institutions covered by the most recent 
EMN survey (EMN, 2010), as many as 44% reported targeting 
women, 41% ethnic minorities and migrants, 32% the unem-
ployed, 29% the youth, and 21% the disabled. However, when 
looking at the proportions of microloan clients, only 27% were 
women, 13% were immigrants or members of ethnic minorities, 
and 10% were young people (aged 15-24), despite the stated 
desire of many MFIs to cater for these groups. The propor-
tion of women is far lower than the corresponding share in 
the developing world, while immigrants and ethnic minorities 
are underrepresented compared to their incidence in the EU 
entrepreneurial population. Digging more deeply into the reasons for this inconsistency sug-
gests that one issue could be discrimination against disadvan-
taged and under-represented groups, even among microcredit 
providers. In the case of France, there is some evidence that 
microcredit conditions (e.g. size of the loan and interest rate) 
for women are worse than for men, and cannot be explained 
by either the characteristics of the entrepreneur (e.g. age, work 
experience, education, etc.) or those of the firm (e.g. business 
size, business age, industry, etc.) (Brana, 2013). ( 5 ) 
There are, however, some exceptions. For example, ADIE in France was 
set up in 1989. ( 6 ) 
The EMN survey provides a snapshot about the MFIs that have 
responded to the questionnaire; thus this picture does not necessarily 
reflect that of the EU's microcredit market as a whole. 15 Box 4 Setting up a microcredit programme Policy makers are faced with important choices when setting up a microcredit scheme. One concerns the Fund operator, which can 
either be selected through a public call for tender or be chosen without any tender among existing public institutions with experience 
in Fund management. The first option has the advantage of drawing on the most cost-effective solution to the government. The 
second option will ensure better coherence between the Fund's operations and the government's strategic objectives (COPIE, undated). A second choice regards the financial intermediary organisation that will deliver the scheme, which can be an ad-hoc govern-
ment body or be chosen among existing players in the credit market (e.g. commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, 
credit unions, etc.), generally through a call for tender. The first option will have the main benefit of building an organisation 
tailored to its mission, but which will have high overhead costs, especially if the microcredit programme is only temporary. 
The second will have the main advantage of leveraging on the expertise of players already active in the credit market, but 
who may not devote the same level of attention to microcredit than to their other activities. Microcredit schemes require an attentive distribution of costs among participants, namely government, providers and clients. 
There are several fixed costs involved in a microcredit scheme, including the loan capital, operating and refinancing costs, 
loan assessment and monitoring costs, etc. Additional services such as interest rebates, financial advice and education, and 
business development training also imply costs for microcredit providers. Microcredit initiatives are, therefore, unlikely to become fully self-sustainable, and policy makers should expect a strong 
element of subsidisation. This will be especially true for programmes for disadvantaged entrepreneurs who may need com-
plementary services such as interest rebates and business training to be pulled in the scheme. The provision of additional 
services, together with better communication targeting both disadvantaged entrepreneurs and MFIs, should be part of a 
comprehensive strategy aimed at making microcredit more inclusive than has been so far. The main advantage of microcredit is that, unlike other products 
(e.g. guarantees, crowdfunding, etc.), it is a mechanism specifically 
devised for entrepreneurs who experience difficulties in the credit 
market. Microcredit also helps build the credit history of its clients, 
thus favouring their access to traditional sources of finance. On the 
other hand, microcredit is unlikely to become financially self-sustain-
able. The harder-to-reach is the target group, the stronger will be the 
degree of subsidisation. A marginal risk is also that microcredit, rather than strengthening the credit history of clients, further marginalises 
them into a segmented credit market due to social stigma attributed 
to microcredit clients by senior lending institutions. There are many microcredit initiatives in the EU that deserve 
attention. The case of Fair Finance in London and Crédal in 
Belgium are reported in Boxes 5 and 6 to show how two dif-
ferent approaches work. Box 5 The UK Fair Finance Microcredit Programme Target Group: Unbankable clients who have fallen prey to money lenders applying usury loan terms. Intervention type: Microcredit and financial education together. UK Fair Finance benefits from guarantees by the European 
Progress Microfinance Facility. Objectives: To help unbankable clients out of usury loans through fair credit conditions and financial education. Clients also 
include disadvantaged entrepreneurs through loans up to GBP 10 000. Entry requirements: Clients must present feasible financing requests, e.g. repayment of the micro loan must be possible. 
Financial education is accessible for selected target groups. Description: Fair Finance was launched in 2005 as a spin-off of two successful microcredit and debt advice programmes. The first 
helped over 600 women on peer group circles and made over 300 loans to excluded women in East London. The second worked with 
Local Housing Associations to provide debt advice to indebted house tenants. Today Fair Finance is a not-for-profit social enterprise that 
works with unbankable clients to provide them with fair credit conditions and advice on debt management. The ultimate goal is to prevent 
clients from resorting to usury loans in the black credit market that would further worsen their financial debt situation. The programme 
also develops relationship with traditional banks so that unbankable clients can open bank accounts in the Fair Finance's offices. To sum 
up, the range of products offered are: i) personal loans of up to GBP 2 000 at affordable rates to help clients out of usury loans; ii) loans 
of up to GBP 10 000 to entrepreneurs unable to access mainstream finance to develop their business idea; iii) debt advice and financial 
capability workshop to local residents to improve their financial management skills; iv) bank account access for people without one. Results achieved: in 2011 Fair Finance secured investments from a range of social investors to build its business across 
London, and commercial finance from 3 banks to expand its loan capital. Lessons for other initiatives: Strong leadership and strict administrative procedures are needed to launch effective 
microcredit programmes; targeted approaches in microcredit result in bringing excluded groups into mainstream economy; 
access to microcredit can reduce financial burdens, but not necessarily results in business development; transparency in 
financing (for instance through open information on websites) is an effective tool for promotion and marketing; consider-
able time needed to attract funding from private sources for the expansion of the model; support services such as financial 
education are effective in improving the general understanding of the borrowing process and can reduce over-indebtedness. 16 Box 6 Belgium's Crédal Microfinance Co-operative Target Group: Financially excluded people due to low income, lack of guarantees or bad credit history. Intervention type: Start-up microloans and social credit, with the participation of the European Social Fund, the Walloon 
region, the Brussels region, and the banking sector. Crédal also benefits from guarantees by the European Progress 
Microfinance Facility. Objectives: To strengthen the financial inclusion of non-bankable people that would not be able to receive credit from 
senior lending institutions. Entry requirements: For start-up microloans, being interested in becoming self-employed but having been rejected by a 
senior lending institution. Programme length: Repayment period for microloans is up to 48 months. Description: Crédal was founded in 1984 with the vision of reinforcing social cohesion. Its first activity was to finance non-
profit organisations and cooperatives through various traditional credit mechanisms at low interest rates. In 2000, Crédal 
started a microcredit programme targeting credit-excluded people who wanted to start a business but could not obtain 
suitable finance from traditional banks. The size of loans ranges from EUR 500 to EUR 12 500, repayment is due within 48 
months, and the charged interest rate is 5%. Microcredit is combined with other microfinance instruments such as  " social 
credit " , which addresses the transport, training or health-related needs of low-income. Results achieved: In 2012, Crédal granted 642 microloans for business start-ups and 2 032 social loans. Lessons for other initiatives: Target group approach is effective; multi-stakeholder support in terms of financing is needed 
in the start-up and expansion phases of the microcredit activity; subsidies for operational costs and supporting services are 
justified to ensure that a fair (but still market-level) interest rate is charged. Microcredit plays a central role in the European Union's strat-
egy for financial inclusion and inclusive growth. In 2010, the 
Commission's Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs 
and Inclusion set up the European  " Progress Microfinance "  
Facility, which absorbed previous smaller initiatives in the field 
and represents the first EU-wide initiative designed specifically 
for the microfinance sector (EC, 2013b). (7) Jointly funded by 
the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, 
 " Progress Microfinance "  follows a two-pronged approach. On 
the one hand, it provides guarantees and counter-guarantees 
to lending institutions (banks, microcredit providers, etc.) to 
support their portfolios of microloans. On the other, it offers 
the same eligible institutions four types of funded instruments: 
senior loans, subordinated loans, risk-sharing loans and equity 
participations. The guarantee mechanism has been allocated 
EUR 25 million by the European Commission, while the four 
funded instruments are jointly supported by the European 
Commission (EUR 80 million) and the European Investment 
Bank (EUR 100 million) (EIF, 2012). In June 2013, it was decided to further integrate  " Progress 
Microfinance "  into a wider EU initiative for employment and 
social cohesion; the EU programme for  " Employment and 
Social Innovation "  (EaSI). EASI integrates and extends the cov-
erage of three existing programmes: i) Progress (Programme 
for Employment and Social Solidarity); ii) EURES (European 
Employment Services); and iii)  " Progress Microfinance " . The 
latter will receive 21% of the overall EaSI budget. There will 
also be extended coverage for social enterprises and funding 
for capacity-building in microfinance institutions. ( 7 ) 
Further information about Progress Microfinance is available 
at http://ec.europa.eu/epmf Alternative debt finance Overdrafts, factoring, leasing and trade credit are important 
sources of debt finance alternative to bank loans. There is 
evidence that small businesses use these sources of finance 
extensively, with more than one-quarter using trade credit, 
more than one-third using leasing, hire purchase and factor-
ing, and more than one-third using credit lines and overdrafts 
(European Central Bank, 2013; European Commission, 2011). 
With the possible exception of trade credit, alternative sources 
of debt finance are more expensive than loans and are gleaned 
mainly when bank credit is unavailable or difficult to obtain. From a policy perspective, alternative credit financing can 
be influenced by national (and sometimes local) regulatory 
reforms impacting on leasing contracts, factoring legislation, 
fees and interest rates on overdrafts, etc. Factoring can also 
be affected by public procurement to the extent that the public 
administration represents an important player in this industry. 
For example, one-third of transferred receivables in Italy are 
from the public sector. (8) Since entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups find it difficult 
to obtain commercial bank loans, alternative debt finance is 
relevant to them. Policy can help by pointing disadvantaged 
and under-represented entrepreneurs to these sources of 
finance, e.g. through information, advice and mentoring. It can 
also lobby with banks, especially community-based ones (e.g. 
savings banks and cooperative banks), to help disadvantaged ( 8 )

retrieved on 02/04/2013. 17 entrepreneurs obtain a bank account and credit line. Credit lines 
can be subsidised through interest rebates, which will lower the 
debt burden on those who may already have limited assets and 
a negative credit history. Trade credit is also relevant because 
it is common in the retailing industry, where migrant and ethnic 
entrepreneurs are disproportionally represented. There is scope 
for raising awareness among this target group about the role 
of trade credit for enterprise financing. Crowdfunding Crowdfunding addresses market, cultural and institutional bar-
riers in access to finance by disadvantaged entrepreneurs and 
responds to the idea that enterprise financing comes from a 
multitude of people who invest (small) sums, rather than from a 
single large institution, usually via the Internet. The main advan-
tage for both entrepreneurs and investors lie in the low interme-
diation costs of crowdfunding, which makes it a cheaper source 
of finance compared to loan and loan guarantees. Intermediation 
costs are dropped for three reasons. First, the assessment of 
business proposals is less thorough than for bank loans because 
crowdfunding companies do not carry the risk of failure related 
to the proposals they post on their web portal. Although a health-
check of business pitches is common to many platforms, there 
is no incentive for them to undertake a systematic risk analy-
sis. Second, the project follow-up (i.e. monitoring costs) is also 
minimal and generally left to the direct contact between the 
entrepreneur and the investors, with the crowdfunding website 
acting as a virtual meeting point. Third, relying strongly on the 
Internet, crowdfunding portals have low fixed costs (e.g. staff 
and office space). Crowdfunding comes under four main categories, although 
variants and hybrid forms co-exist (De Buysere et al., 2012): @BULLET Donations: in crowdfunding donations are collected and ear-
marked for specific projects, which have often a social nature. @BULLET Rewards: the investee provides the investor with a reward 
that can be of non-monetary nature (e.g. the product that 
the investor is financing) and which is of lower value than 
the sum offered. @BULLET Lending: thanks to lower intermediation costs, borrowers 
pay a lower interest rate than for bank loans, while lenders 
receive a higher interest rate than for savings deposits. @BULLET Equity: this is less common than the other three options and 
involves larger sums. Equity crowdfunding is rather similar 
to the activity of business angels, although in crowdfunding 
the local dimension of the investment and its business advice 
component are less strong (Agrawal et al., 2011). In the first three types of crowdfunding, suppliers of finance 
are often not only motivated by profit-seeking but also by 
emotional and social objectives. This, together with the small sums involved, makes crowdfunding relevant to inclu-
sive entrepreneurship. Crowdfunding is a very new market and estimates of its size 
need to be taken with caution. De Buysere et al. (2012) report 
that in 2011 there were around 200 platforms in Europe which 
had raised EUR 300 million of funding. This corresponded to 
one-half of the total number of platforms worldwide and 
one-fourth of the global crowdfunding market (EUR 1.2 billion). 
The average platform in Europe therefore raises less funding 
than the global average. The average size of the business pitch changes greatly in Europe 
depending on the type of crowdfunding. It is approximately 
EUR 500 for donations, EUR 3 000 for rewards, EUR 4 500 for 
lending, and EUR 50 000 for equity-based crowdfunding. All 
these forms of crowdfunding are on the rise in Europe, although 
donations take the lion's share with respect to the absolute 
number of crowdfunding campaigns. Policy-wise, there is an increasing request for better regulation 
of crowdfunding. The downside of low intermediation costs is, 
in fact, low control by crowdfunding platforms on the viability 
and progress of the business proposals they host. Similarly, 
information on business projects is limited to what entrepre-
neurs are willing to disclose, whereas more structured and 
homogenous information requirements would help investors 
to make a better choice. Since crowdfunding is a very new market and disadvantaged 
entrepreneurs are not always up-to-date with the latest evo-
lutions in business financing, there is scope for strengthening 
information about this financing mechanism. Financial education 
of both entrepreneurs and investors will help them to understand 
mutual expectations and obligations related to crowdfunding 
transactions. Training and advice for disadvantaged entrepre-
neurs will have to focus on debt management issues or, should 
crowdfunding be equity-based, on the implications of exter-
nal equity for business ownership and business management. 
Investors, too, would benefit from help in the assessment of 
business pitches. Since much of crowdfunding is also driven by 
social considerations, advice will need to go beyond traditional 
concepts such as returns on investment (ROI). The relevance of crowdfunding is also related to being one 
of the few equity options available to disadvantaged entre-
preneurs. Small sums of equity will be especially useful to 
innovative entrepreneurial projects run by young or migrant 
entrepreneurs or that address societal challenges (e.g. popula-
tion ageing, global warming, etc.). The support of equity-based 
crowdfunding, however, also calls for the parallel development 
of senior investors (e.g. business angels) and secondary mar-
kets to guarantee exit options for those who have invested 
through equity-based crowdfunding. Seedmatch provides an example of the potential of equity-
based crowdfunding for youth entrepreneurship. 18 Box 7 Germany's Seedmatch Crowdfunding Platform Target Group: Start-ups looking for small sums of equity finance. Objectives: To strengthen the capitalisation of new start-ups by making access to external equity finance possible. Intervention type: Equity-based investment. Programme length: Between 5 and 7 years. Description: Seedmatch is one of the few equity-based platforms in Europe, enabling funders to invest in new start-ups 
and receive shares in return. Seedmatch carries out an in-depth assessment of the business proposals, which abide by 
transparency requirements, and only posts on the platform those that consider worth of investment. This means that they 
target companies with innovation potential and scalable business models. They receive around 1 000 applications per year, 
long-list 200, short-list no more than 50 for interview, and finally post online for investment around 25. Minimum investment 
is EUR 200, while the average investment is EUR 600. From a demographic point of view, young entrepreneurs are quite 
strongly represented among the business founders admitted to the stage of investment, possibly because of the  " new "  and 
Internet-based nature of this model of business financing. Results: Until now the platform counts approximately 12 500 registered users and has funded 34 business start-ups for 
an investment capital of EUR 3.85 million. Lessons for other initiatives: Entrepreneurs must be able to clearly present their business plans and ideas to potential 
investors; crowdfunding through subordinated loans and equity investments can be an effective tool for innovative start-ups; 
investment exit strategies need to be in place at the outset of the funding campaign; platforms have difficulty in becoming 
self-sustainable if the number and volume of transactions remain small. Source : Molenaar, 2013 Peer-to-peer lending Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is similar to lending-based crowd-
funding. Interest rates in these transactions are higher than 
for bank loans, this being the main rationale for the involve-
ment of lenders. However, it is not uncommon for P2P lend-
ing to be based on subordinated loans, i.e. loans that in 
case of liquidation can only be claimed after borrowers 
have paid senior lenders. On the borrower's side, P2P lend-
ing requires fewer personal securities than bank lending, 
although higher-than-average interest rates will result in 
higher levels of indebtedness. Interest rates in P2P lending 
are set by managing platforms and funds, based on the 
financial information and personal securities of the borrower. 
In some innovative cases, peer-to-peer platforms can carry 
part of the default risk or provide partial insurance against 
loan defaults. The volume of peer-to-peer lending is appraised at 
EUR 20 million per month in Europe (De Buysere et al., 2012), 
although estimates are only approximate. Success stories in 
P2P lending platforms include Funding Circle in the UK and 
Smava in Germany. Peer-to-peer lending is meaningful to inclusive entrepre-
neurship for two main reasons. First, it will favour access to 
finance to non-bankable entrepreneurs, although the risk of 
over-indebtedness should not be underestimated. Secondly, 
it can encourage the transfer of resources among members 
of the same community (i.e. peers). This makes it relevant, 
for example, to migrant and ethnic-minority entrepreneurship 
thanks to the possible support of diaspora members. The development of peer-to-peer lending will require govern-
ment action similar to the one suited for crowdfunding, covering 
areas such as regulation, financial education and information. 
In the case of peer-to-peer lending, improved regulation will 
involve enhanced information on the borrower's profile and on 
the distribution of the default risk between online platforms 
and investors. (9) Reformers should however take into account 
that increased transparency will entail increased costs and thus 
strike the right balance between the protection of investors and 
the development of new promising sources of business finance. 
Policy makers can further support P2P lending for inclusive 
entrepreneurship through fiscal incentives for investors and 
platforms with a focus on certain target groups or, at local 
level, by facilitating the matchmaking between entrepreneurs 
and investors. Business angels Business angels are net worth individuals who invest sums 
of equity finance in an unquoted business in which they have 
no family connection with the goal of making a profit in the 
medium to long-term. In addition to providing finance, business 
angels are also a source of business advice and professional 
networks. The size of business angels' investment tends to 
vary between EUR 25 000 and 500 000, but it can reach larger 
scale when they invest through networks, clubs or syndicates. ( 9 ) 
The Bank of France has, for instance, recently declared that crowdfunding 
platforms would have to abide by the same obligations ruling banks and 
other financial institutions, which also implies the presence of capital 
requirements. Le Monde, TPE: la voie étroite du crowdfunding, 25/03/2013. 
http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/03/25/tpe-la-voie-etroite-
du-crowdfunding_1853646_3234.html 19 The business angel market in Europe is estimated at EUR 5 billion, 
only 10% of which is visible through the 460 business angel 
networks identified by the European Trade Association for 
Business Angels (EBAN). The five biggest markets in the EU 
are the UK, Spain, France, Finland and Germany, and the aver-
age investment per company is EUR 175 000. (10) Although business angels are often associated with high-growth 
entrepreneurship, they can play a role in inclusive entrepreneur-
ship, too. It should, however, be recalled that profit-making is 
one of the main drivers of business angel investment, which 
is therefore naturally geared towards growth-oriented sectors. 
This is shown by the sector bias of business angel investment 
in Europe, 70% of which goes to information and communica-
tions technologies and biotech together, while less than 10% 
is directed to consumer goods and services and retail. This helps explain why women-owned businesses, which are 
less growth-oriented than men-owned businesses even within 
high-tech sectors, only capture a very small fraction of busi-
ness angel investment and equity finance. (11) Women are also 
less likely to become business angels, representing less than 
5% of the business angel population, which may help explain 
the low proportion of business angel investment directed to 
women-owned businesses, although female business angels 
are not particularly influenced by gender considerations in their 
investment decisions (Harrison and Mason, 2007). When female entrepreneurs look for external equity investment, 
they rely extensively on their personal networks of family and 
friends to reach out to business angels and win their trust 
(Amatucci and Sohl, 2004). This pattern is common to the 
entire business angel sector, which is small-sized and driven 
by personal and affinity relationships. But it means that female 
and young entrepreneurs, who have typically less extensive 
personal networks, will be at a disadvantage compared to their 
male and senior counterparts. For the same reasons, immigrant 
entrepreneurs can benefit from business angel investment from 
investors in their home countries provided that they keep ties 
with the country of origin. Silicon Valley in the United States is 
a case in point of a place where social networks of migrants 
have evolved into professional and business associations, which 
have helped build a two-way bridge where equity investments 
flow between host and home countries (Saxenian, 2006). Policy makers in the EU can support business angel investment 
for socially excluded entrepreneurs in various ways. First, the ( 10 ) Data on the European business angel market are drawn from the EBAN 
 " European Angel Investment Overview: 2012 " . http://www.eban.org/ 
wp-content/uploads/2013/07/EBAN-Angel-Investment-Overview-2012.pdf ( 11 ) In the United States, for example, women represent only 7% of venture 
capital clients. creation of affinity business angel networks can be encouraged, 
for example, by subsidising their operational costs. There are 
a few examples of female and diaspora angel groups already 
existing in Europe, although they are more likely to operate 
in places where there is a high density of entrepreneurship 
that provides a constant flow of investment opportunities 
(e.g. London and Cambridge in the UK) (OECD, 2011). Second, 
the investment readiness of targeted entrepreneurs can be 
strengthened through ad-hoc programmes that aim to enhance 
the investment prospects of their business pitches. A study of 
deals declined by UK business angels highlighted three domi-
nant reasons for rejection: weakness in the entrepreneur or 
management team, marketing factors and flawed financial 
projections (Mason and Kwok, 2010). Investment readiness 
programme could start with addressing these issues. Third, 
tax breaks are commonly used to stimulate the business angel 
market. Special tax breaks can be envisioned for those busi-
ness angel networks that invest in enterprises launched by 
members of disadvantaged and under-represented groups 
in entrepreneurship. Fourth, public co-investment in business 
angel networks targeting inclusive entrepreneurship is another 
policy option, although policy makers should leave investment 
decisions to private investors better placed to assess the growth 
prospects of the financed business. Finally, initiatives that 
facilitate matchmaking between investors and entrepreneurs 
from disadvantaged and under-represented groups are a low-
cost policy option that can help trigger initial interest in equity 
finance for inclusive entrepreneurship. Islamic finance Muslims in Europe are estimated at 44 million (6% of the 
overall population) and projected to increase to 58 million 
within the next 20 years. (12) Within the European Union, esti-
mates point to about 19 million of Muslims, 3.8% of the 
EU population (Pew Forum, 2011). The presence of Muslims 
is stronger in Western and Northern Europe, particularly in 
the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom 
due to the inflow of Muslim migrants and second-generation 
Muslim Europeans. Muslims are especially concentrated in 
urban areas. They are 24% of the population in Amsterdam, 
17% in Brussels, 10-15% in the Paris region and 8.5% in 
Greater London. (13) Islamic finance, which refers to financing 
tools complying with Sharia-law that forbids interest rates, 
could help the promotion of migrant and ethnic minority entre-
preneurship in certain countries and regions. ( 12 ) This estimate excludes Turkey but includes Russia. ( 13 ) The Economist, When Town Halls Turn to La Mecca, 4 December 
2008, retrieved 10/07/2013. http://www.economist.com/ 
node/12724966?story_id=12724966 20 Box 8 Major Islamic finance products Some of the major Islamic finance investment vehicles are the following: @BULLET Profit sharing (i.e. mudharabah): The investor supplies the entrepreneur with funds and receives a return, based on an 
agreed profit-sharing ratio. This principle can apply both to bank deposits and business financing. Eventual losses are 
suffered by the provider of capital. @BULLET Cost plus (i.e. murabahah): This transaction involves the sale of goods at a price which includes a profit margin agreed 
by both parties. However, in Murabahah, sellers must let buyers know the actual cost of the assets at the time of the 
initial agreement. @BULLET Joint venture (i.e. musharakah): It refers to a partnership in which profits will be shared based on an agreed ratio which 
may not be in the same proportion of the invested amounts. On the other hand, incurred losses will be shared according 
to the original ratio invested by each partner. @BULLET Agency (i.e. wakalah): This is a contract whereby a person (principal) asks another to act on his/her behalf for a specific 
task. The person who takes on the task is an agent who will be paid a fee for the service. @BULLET Interest-free financing (i.e. quard): financing is given for a fixed period on a goodwill basis and the borrower is only required 
to repay the amount borrowed. However, borrowers may pay an extra amount as a way to thank the lender if they wish so. Source: Molenaar, 2013 There has been a recent surge in the number of Islamic finan-
cial institutions worldwide, mainly banks and funds, although 
they have so far privileged large investment operations over 
lending to entrepreneurs. Many countries are behind the game 
in terms of the number of Islamic finance institutions and the 
volume of their lending. Policy makers in Europe can contribute to reversing this trend 
by supporting the introduction of Sharia-compliant financial 
products within major commercial banks. This will most likely 
require the training of loan officers charged with the offer of 
Islamic finance products. Awareness-raising campaigns will also 
be important on both the demand and supply sides. Muslim 
entrepreneurs may be unaware of new Sharia-compliant prod-
ucts in the credit market, while financial institutions that offer these products need to be ushered into lending to entrepreneurs. 
Community-based organisations can help spread the voice about 
Islamic finance opportunities among Muslim entrepreneurs. Islamic finance can positively impact on the integration of hard-
to-reach entrepreneurs who would not look for credit unless it 
abides by their religious beliefs. However, policy makers should 
be aware that recent experiments to introduce Islamic finance 
products have not always been successful in Europe, partly 
because of the low income and low activity rates of the target 
population (Stressman Foundation, 2012). The UK is the country in the European Union where Islamic finance 
has advanced the most, with the Islamic Bank of Britain stand-
ing out as the only fully Sharia-compliant bank in the country. Box 9 Islamic Bank of Britain Target Group: Muslims interested in financial products, not only related to business financing, compliant with Sharia law. Objectives: To offer alternative sources of financing to segments of the UK population who, for religious beliefs, are not 
willing to pay interest rates on borrowed money. Intervention type: retail banking, mainly savings products and overdrafts facilities. Programme length: Authorised to operate under UK banking law since 2004, including credit facilities. Description: The Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB) offers the largest range of Sharia-compliant financial products in the UK, including 
mortgage alternatives, current accounts, savings accounts, and assets management solutions. The major shareholder is Qatar 
International Islamic Bank (over 80%), with the remaining 20% shared between large private investors and the general public. Results: IBB has opened up new banking opportunities for the UK Muslim population, although the share of portfolio covered 
by small businesses and individual clients remains marginal. Most business financing is still concentrated in large operations. Lessons for other initiatives: Faith-based schemes operate in closed target markets and are therefore subject to less 
competition and to reliance on standard products; if Islamic finance is to be used for entrepreneurship financing, clear 
promotion campaigns are required; Islamic banks need to devise appropriate services packages to cater for small business 
owners; Islamic finance products are typically more expensive than traditional bank products. Source: Moolenar, 2003 21 Self-financing groups Self-financing groups are community-based systems in which 
members lend to each other. They have originally arisen in 
developing countries, where the most common form has 
been Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA). More 
recently, they have also mushroomed in Europe, namely in 
Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Belgium and the Netherlands 
(Molenaar, 2013). Loans in self-financing groups are proportional to the deposits 
of members. An interest rate can be applied, in which case 
profits are re-invested in the group. Loans are in the range 
of EUR 5 000, with repayment periods often within 6 months and never longer than a year. The evidence from developing 
countries points to high repayment rates in group lending 
(Ledgerwood, 1998), although some argue that by self-select-
ing their members self-financing groups exclude those at the 
very margins of the society (Green, 2005). Self-financing groups have the potential to enhance the resil-
ience of vulnerable entrepreneurs (e.g. migrants and disabled 
people), although linkages with more structured forms of 
public support are important to avoid the marginalisation of 
members. Policy-wise, it will therefore be important to encour-
age ties between self-financing groups and, for example, 
microcredit institutions to support the financial inclusion of 
group members. Box 10 Spain's Association of Self-financed Communities (ACAF) Target Group: Low-income people who are financially and socially excluded, often with a migrant background. Objectives: To offer alternative sources of debt finance to non-bankable people. Intervention type: Small sums of debt finance for income-generating activities. Programme length: Continuous cycles of one year. Description: Since 2004 the Spanish foundation Associación de Comunidades Autofinanciadas (ACAF) has gained expe-
rience in setting up and managing self-funded groups. Partners in ACAF involve the large-scale NGO Ashoka, the Levi 
Strauss Foundation and the Catalonian regional government. Each  " self-funded "  community (CAF) can be composed of 10 
to 30 people who, through the investment of small sums, become the owners and customers of the organisation. CAFs 
provide services to their members, such as credit and insurance, while generating revenues through interests applied to 
loans. The model differs from traditional microcredit because it does not rely on external funds. More recently, through 
the creation of the Winkomun platform (www.winkomun.org), the organisation has aimed to disseminate more effectively 
the experience of CAFs, facilitate access to the methodology of how to build a CAF, and promote interaction between 
members of CAF communities. Results: Since 2004, ACAF has assisted the foundation of about 80 self-financed groups, with more than 3 500 indi-
rect beneficiaries. Lessons for other initiatives: Self-financing groups are an effective tool to promote social inclusion, including through 
start-up funding; complementary social orientation and mobilisation programmes are needed to trigger the creation of self-
help groups; a clear structure helps accelerate the establishment and operations of self-financing groups. Source: Molenaar, 2013 THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION The discussion has hitherto focused on how policy can 
strengthen the supply of finance, based on evidence that some 
groups of entrepreneurs are disadvantaged, if not discrimi-
nated, in credit markets (Muravyev et al. 2009; Alesina et al., 
2013; Fairlie, 2010). These initiatives should be coupled with 
financial education interventions aimed at overcoming skills 
barriers in access to finance. The objective should be to make 
disadvantaged entrepreneurs ready to receive a loan or invest-
ment at market conditions. A recent OECD survey on knowledge, attitudes and behav-
iours around financial issues points to significant knowledge 
gaps within the adult population (Atkinson and Messy, 2012). 
The proportion of the population with high scores in financial knowledge ranges between 40% in Norway and 69% in Hungary 
among the EU countries covered by the survey. (14) Strong differences in financial knowledge are observed across 
different socio-demographic groups. Women have on average 
lower scores than men, with a gender gap above 20 per-
centage points in Norway, Poland and the UK. While 67% of 
men in Germany and the United Kingdom reach a high score 
in financial knowledge, the share for women is respectively 
50% and 40%. ( 14 ) The category of financial knowledge included non-specialist questions on 
 " division " ,  " time value of money " ,  " interest paid on loan " ,  " calculation of 
interest plus principle " ,  " compound interest " ,  " risk and return " ,  " definition 
of inflation " ,  " diversification " . 22 Age, income and level of education also matter. Respondents 
with high scores in financial knowledge are most likely to be in 
the age group between 30 and 60 years old, while the youngest 
and oldest respondents do comparatively worse. People with 
high levels of education also obtain better scores in financial 
knowledge, with the largest education-based gap in financial 
knowledge in Germany and Poland. Yet, people with little or no 
formal education also achieve high scores, which suggests that 
financial education can be delivered across a wide range of 
social groups. Finally, those with high income have better finan-
cial knowledge than those with low income, although income 
is also positively correlated with age and level of education 
(Atkinson and Messy, 2012). Financial knowledge influences financial attitudes and behav-
iours. Those who rank high in financial knowledge will also 
show stronger propensity to saving and to appropriate financial 
behaviours (e.g. sound budget management, timely payment of 
bills, etc.). An exception is represented by women, who do better 
than men with respect to financial attitudes and behaviours in 
spite of lower scores in financial knowledge. Improving financial literacy skills through financial education 
is, therefore, an important policy area. This is especially true 
for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups, since the way 
they manage their business and connect with credit markets 
will affect their livelihood and that of their families. In this 
respect, it is generally recommended that financial educa-
tion programmes be strongly tailored, because initial financial knowledge will vary a great deal among participants (OECD, 
2012b). Programmes should also be of hands-on nature, draw-
ing on experiential and interactive methodologies. The ulti-
mate goal should be to influence attitudes and behaviours, 
rather than focus on financial concepts and principles. Timing 
is also important and should be close to when education is 
most likely to have an impact. Including financial education 
principles in vocational education colleges, self-employment 
training courses or still in active labour market programmes for 
the unemployed can make inclusive entrepreneurship stronger. 
Policy makers should also work on the qualification and accredi-
tation of financial education providers to guarantee quality in 
the offer of training, while banks and other financial institu-
tions should be encouraged to communicate with clients in a 
language that is as simple as possible (OECD, 2005). In addition to being offered through bespoke programmes, 
financial education can be integrated into other schemes. This 
is, in fact, the best way to deliver financial education because 
training will have a practical end and will be delivered at a 
time when it is most likely to have an impact. Some micro-
finance programmes (e.g. Bulgaria's JOBS Financial Leasing 
– see Box 11), income-subsidy programmes (e.g. Germany's 
Start-up Subsidy) and subsidised credit programmes (e.g. Italy's 
Honour Loans) provide good practice examples, but still too 
often financing schemes do not foresee a component that 
strengthens the financial knowledge of participants. Expected 
benefits from this policy change would include lower rejections 
in loan applications and lower rates of loan default. 23 Box 11  " Job Opportunities through Business Support "  (JOBS) Financial Leasing Project, Bulgaria Target Group: Unbankable low-income people who already run a micro or small business or intend to start a new one. The 
project mainly operates in rural areas (40% of the leases are granted to agricultural producers) that display high rates of 
unemployment and high proportions of minority groups (e.g. Turkish and Roma minorities). Objectives: To provide subsidised leasing for the purchase of equipment to entrepreneurs from marginalised groups, thus 
favouring their social integration. Intervention type: The provision of finance – leasing in this case – is combined with financial education and business 
management training. The training component is compulsory and the leased equipment is only received after participants 
have passed a test assessing their understanding of basic financial and management principles. Ownership of the leased 
good is attained after full repayment of the lease. Programme length: It varies depending on the value of the leased equipment. Description: The JOBS Financial Leasing Project's offer has been comprehensive and flexible. It combines the supply of 
leasing finance with business support services such as financial education and business management training. Future 
entrepreneurs must complete 20 hours of training, after which they sit an examination where they have to answer correctly 
80% of the questions. However, those who already manage a business can try to pass the test without going through the 
full training course. The JOBS Financial Leasing Project caters for both existing and future entrepreneurs. The latter are targeted through the 
Start-with-Leasing programme. For new entrepreneurs the only condition to receive support is to have a viable business 
idea that will result into the hiring of at least one additional person. The programme is also tailored to the special needs of 
Roma entrepreneurs, who receive longer repayment terms and grace periods and are requested a smaller advance payment. The programme is delivered by 42 business centres and 10 business incubators, which have been set up at local level by 
local labour offices, municipalities and other public and private-sector organisations. Centres and incubators take the legal 
status of not-for-profit organisations and are in charge of the purchase of the leased equipment and of the financial educa-
tion and business development courses. Results: From 2000 to 2008, 1 985 companies were supported by the scheme through EUR 10.4 million in leasing finance, 
34 660 people obtained stable employment, and nearly 53 500 benefitted from training courses. The programme has grown 
in popularity throughout the 1990s, and business incubators and business centres have become able to generate revenues 
by leasing equipment to participants. Lessons for other initiatives: Financial education, together with business development training, should be a key component 
of programmes that supply finance for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups; business support 
services such as training and advice should be delivered both before and during the period of financial support; leasing can 
be an important component of microfinance programmes, provided that adequate measures are taken to prevent frauds 
(e.g. public registration of equipment) and intense marketing of clients is undertaken. Source: http://goodpracticeroma.ppa.coe.int/en/pdf/110 CONCLUSIONS Women, migrant, young and low-educated entrepreneurs expe-
rience difficult access to credit and credit conditions. Although 
cases of open discrimination are possible, this is more often 
the outgrowth of firm-specific and market-specific factors: e.g. 
low entrepreneurial and financial literacy skills of the entre-
preneur and undercapitalisation or low growth prospects of 
the business. The mere supply of finance is unlikely to solve 
alone a condition of multifaceted disadvantage. Programmes 
financing inclusive entrepreneurship should be aligned with 
other initiatives supporting entrepreneurial skills and market 
development skills. Grants and subsidised credit have proven effective in the past 
in helping the self-employment of hard-to-reach groups (e.g. 
the unemployed and the youth), although they are an expensive 
policy in a time of public budget constraints. Emerging financing schemes can complement traditional policies. Loan guarantee 
programmes have been applied in many EU countries (e.g. Italy, 
France, Denmark, the Netherlands, etc.). However, the main 
focus of credit guarantee schemes has been on traditional small 
enterprises, while their ability to reach disadvantaged new 
entrepreneurs needs be strengthened. This recommendation 
also applies to microcredit. At the EU level, women and migrants 
are underrepresented among the clients of MFIs compared to 
the share they represent in the entrepreneurial population. 
Targeted microcredit programmes are warranted to ensure that 
these groups are not excluded from a financing mechanism 
that is important for the goals of inclusive entrepreneurship. New Internet-based sources of finance (e.g. crowdfunding and 
peer-to-peer lending) hold the potential to foster inclusive 
entrepreneurship mainly in light of the small sums they provide 24 and the emotional drive that motivate investors. Nonetheless, 
EU and national legislations ruling these platforms will have 
to be strengthened to prevent frauds and provide investors 
with more transparent information on the companies seek-
ing finance. Finally, supply-side interventions need to be coupled with others 
that improve the skills of the entrepreneur. Financial educa-
tion will help disadvantaged entrepreneurs to achieve a better 
understanding of the credit system and increase their chance 
to have loan requests approved. The following recommendations are put forward: @BULLET Monitor the extent to which entrepreneurs from groups 
disadvantaged in the labour market (e.g. youth, migrant, 
low-educated) or underrepresented in the entrepre-
neurial population (e.g. women and seniors) experi-
ence more difficult access to finance than mainstream 
male entrepreneurs. @BULLET Ensure that government-supported loan guarantee pro-
grammes and microcredit schemes adequately reach socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs and, if this is not the case, 
take remedial action by either setting up special sections 
in mainstream schemes, or by launching new targeted pro-
grammes aimed at disadvantaged entrepreneurs (women 
and youth entrepreneurs). @BULLET Expect to provide a strong subsidy component to loan guar-
antee and microcredit programmes that specifically target 
entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups. @BULLET Raise awareness among entrepreneurs about the potential of 
Internet-based financing tools (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-
to-peer lending), but also introduce adequate legislation to 
avoid misuse and protect investors. @BULLET Encourage linkages between community-based tools, such 
as self-financing groups, and more structured government 
programmes aimed at strengthening general access to finance 
for entrepreneurs. @BULLET Combine supply-side policies with improved financial literacy 
skills amongst disadvantaged entrepreneurs to enhance their 
chances of obtaining finance in credit markets. 25 GLOSSARY Basel III – Set of new rules and regulations governing the banking sector introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 global economic 
crisis and that will become fully operational by 2018. These rules mainly provide for higher capital and liquidity requirements, 
with the aim of making banks more resilient to future economic crises. Collateral assets – Assets required of borrowers by lenders to issue a loan. They usually include goods (real estate, 
vehicles, etc.) that can be seized, totally or partly, by the lender in the event of loan default. Crowdfunding – A collective transfer of relatively small resources through lending or equity investment into an entrepreneurial 
project. This is usually done with the help of an Internet platform acting as a virtual meeting point between entrepreneurs 
and investors. Factoring – The sale of accounts receivable by an enterprise to a factoring company at a discounted value. It is used to cope 
with cash-flow emergencies when entrepreneurs prefer receiving a discounted payment immediately rather than await the full 
payment of receivables later. Financial education – The process by which financial consumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products, 
concepts and risks and, through information, instruction and/or objective advice develop the skills and confidence to become more 
aware of financial risks and opportunities to make informed choices, to know where to go for help, and take other effective actions 
to improve their financial well-being (OECD, 2005). Islamic Finance – Financing activity in compliance with Sharia law that forbids the charge of interest rates by lenders on 
borrowers. Lending is not ruled out, but lenders are treated as stakeholders. It has so far been more commonly used by large 
investment funds than to support entrepreneurs. Loan guarantee – Commitment by a third party to cover part of the losses related to a loan default. It can be provided by the 
government and/or or by a private business association. It is backed up by a fund acting as collateral. Leasing – Rental of work-related equipment against a monthly fee. The entrepreneur resorting to leasing may or may not become 
owner of the equipment at the end of the leasing period, depending on the terms of the contract. Microcredit – Small-sized loans to borrowers who find it difficult to obtain credit from traditional banks. It consists in small 
sums generally at higher interest rates than those available at traditional banks to reflect the riskier profile of the borrower. In 
the EU, the microcredit threshold is set at EUR 25 000. Overdrafts – Lines of credit by which lending institutions allow borrowers to withdraw beyond their deposits. They have typically 
a ceiling that reflects the perception of risk that the banks ascribe to borrowers. A very expensive source of external finance, it 
is nonetheless common among entrepreneurs. Self-financing groups – Community-based systems in which members make deposits and lend to each other. They are not dependent 
on external support from philanthropic or financial institutions and lend only up to the limit of the resources they own. Trade credit – Lenders are not financial institutions but company suppliers, who let buyers pay invoices within an agreed delay 
period (usually between 30 and 90 days). Entrepreneurs can therefore use part of the revenues to pay for the supply. It is com-
mon in retail. FURTHER READING Molenaar K. (2013),  " Financing of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises for Underrepresented and Socially Disadvantaged Groups " ,

ISBN 978-92-79-33516-7 This policy brief was produced by the OECD and the European Commission to explore barriers in access to finance by social 
groups who are disadvantaged or under-represented in entrepreneurship and to describe policies which can address these 
barriers. It presents data on the extent to which entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups obtain external finance. It then 
sets out the traditional policy instruments of grants and soft loans together with newer and emerging policies such as loan 
guarantees, microcredit, crowdfunding, business angels and Islamic finance. In addition to supply-side instruments, the role 
of financial education is also explained. Finally, the brief gives a number of examples of policy approaches that have been 
successful in European Union Member States. This policy brief is part of a series of documents produced by the OECD and the European Commission on inclusive entre-
preneurship. The series includes policy briefs on youth entrepreneurship, senior entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, 
evaluation of inclusive entrepreneurship programmes, access to business start-up finance for inclusive entrepreneurship 
and entrepreneurship by the disabled as a well as a report on`Theon`The Missing Entrepreneurs'. All these documents are avai-
lable in English, French and German. They are available at http://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/inclusive-entrepreneurship.htm. HOW TO OBTAIN EU PUBLICATIONS Free publications:
