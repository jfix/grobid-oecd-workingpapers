Box 1 The impact of the crisis and new banking regulations<lb/> The economic crisis has dragged on in Europe since 2008, firstly through the failure and retrenchment of financial institutions<lb/> and then because of the sovereign debt crisis. The crisis has had a severe impact on small business financing. Loan rejections at<lb/> EU-27 aggregate level rose from 12% to 18% between the first and second half of 2009 and then fell back to 11% in 2010 and<lb/> 2011. Loan terms for small firms also worsened comparatively to large firms, and the interest rate spread between SMEs and<lb/> large enterprises widened (OECD, 2012).<lb/> </head>

The outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in summer 2011 is likely to have made access<lb/> to SME loans even more difficult, and SMEs in Greece, Portugal and Italy reported strong increases in their need for bank<lb/> loans over the period from October 2012 to March 2013 (ECB, 2013).</table>

Microcredit first emerged<lb/> in developing countries and reached Europe only more recently.<lb/> The first microfinance institutions (MFIs) date back to the 1980s<lb/> in Eastern Europe and to the 2000s in Western Europe. (5) This<lb/> different timing has led to a divide in the EU microcredit model.<lb/> In eastern countries, for-profit organisations and credit unions<lb/> dominate the sector, whereas in western countries the market<lb/> mainly consists of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and<lb/> non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs).<lb/> With respect to the services offer, most MFIs combine credit<lb/> with business support and other financial services (e.g. con-<lb/>sumer credit, insurances, etc.); only between 25%-30% of<lb/> European MFIs implement microcredit without additional sup-<lb/>port services (Underwood, 2006; EMN, 2010). The business<lb/> model of MFIs, therefore, relies on a combined product offer,<lb/> higher-than-average interest rates, and loan application fees.<lb/> Nonetheless, the sector still largely depends on public support<lb/> to cover both operational costs and the loan capital, as shown<lb/> by the 63% average repayment ratio of the EMN-surveyed<lb/> MFIs (EMN, 2010).
