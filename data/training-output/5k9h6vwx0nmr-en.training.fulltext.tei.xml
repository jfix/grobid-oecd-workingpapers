			<head>METHODOLOGICAL NOTE<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper aims at providing an estimate of the resource envelope required in order to<lb/> achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on the global level. As widely<lb/> acknowledged by previous contributors to this literature, modelling the cost of achieving the<lb/> MDGs poses many data and methodological challenges.<lb/> Like previous contributions, this paper relies on a very simple growth model to relate<lb/> development financing — private or public — to growth in order to estimate how much it would<lb/> cost to halve poverty across developing countries. The virtue of this model is precisely its<lb/> simplicity but the trade-off is that it does not claim to take account of the effects of increases in<lb/> development financing, tax revenues, public expenditure and transfers on the general<lb/> equilibrium of the economy to which it is applied. For instance, increasing the supply of<lb/> schooling does not necessarily guarantee that it will be met with an equivalent increase in the<lb/> demand for education. The model used in this paper simply provides orders of magnitude that<lb/> are helpful to size up the challenges that meeting MDGs entails for low-and middle-income<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, when measuring the amount of transfers or government expenditure that it<lb/> would take to achieve the poverty, education and health MDGs across countries, this paper<lb/> acknowledges that the link between inputs and outcomes is often weak and that absorption and<lb/> delivery issues can represent significant challenges in developing countries. From this<lb/> perspective, the orders of magnitude presented cannot be taken to be precise estimates,<lb/> especially at the country level, of how much public expenditure would be needed to increase in<lb/> order to achieve specific MDGs. The importance of framing the corresponding debate in the<lb/> larger framework of the quality of public policy and institutions is, indeed, a key take-away from<lb/> the MDG costing exercise undertaken in this paper.<lb/></p>

Comme il a été largement reconnu par les contributions précédentes à cette littérature,<lb/> la modélisation du coût de la réalisation des OMDs implique des défis relatifs à la méthodologie<lb/> et aux données. Comme les contributions antérieures, cet article s&apos;appuie sur un modèle de<lb/> croissance très simple pour lier le financement du développement — privé ou public — à la<lb/> croissance afin d&apos;estimer quel serait le coût d&apos;une réduction de moitié de la pauvreté dans les<lb/> pays en voie de développement. Ce modèle a précisément pour vertu sa simplicité mais la<lb/> contrepartie est qu&apos;il n&apos;a pas la prétention de tenir compte des effets de l&apos;augmentation du<lb/> financement du développement, des recettes fiscales, des dépenses et des transferts publiques<lb/> sur l&apos;équilibre général de l&apos;économie à laquelle il est appliqué. Par exemple, un accroissement de<lb/> l&apos;offre de la scolarité ne garantit pas nécessairement qu&apos;il soit rejoint par une augmentation<lb/> équivalente de la demande d&apos;éducation. Le modèle sur lequel ce document se repose génère des<lb/> ordres de grandeur qui sont utiles pour évaluer la taille du défi que représente<lb/> l&apos;accomplissement des OMDs pour les pays à bas et moyens revenus.<lb/> De même, dans le cadre de la mesure du montant des transferts ou des dépenses<lb/> gouvernementales nécessaires pour atteindre les OMDs relatifs à la pauvreté, l&apos;éducation et la<lb/> santé, ce document reconnaît que le lien entre les intrants et les résultats est souvent faible et que<lb/> la capacité d&apos;absorption et l&apos;efficacité des services publiques peuvent représenter des défis<lb/> importants dans les pays en voie de développement. Dans cette perspective, les ordres de<lb/> grandeur présentés ne peuvent être considérés comme des estimations précises, en particulier au<lb/> niveau des pays, du montant dont les dépenses publiques devaient croître pour atteindre des<lb/> OMDs spécifiques. L&apos;importance de recadrer le débat correspondant dans le contexte plus large<lb/> de la qualité des institutions et des politiques publiques est, précisément, une des conclusions<lb/> tirées du présent exercice de mesures des coûts des OMDs entrepris dans ce document.<lb/></figure>

			<head>I. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>An ancient parable describes the blind men who encounter an elephant and take turns<lb/> describing it based on the part of the animal&apos;s body that they touch. Touching the smooth, sharp<lb/> tusk, one describes the elephant like a spear. Holding the squirming trunk, another describes the<lb/> elephant like a snake. Feeling the elephant&apos;s sturdy knee, still another describes the elephant like<lb/> a tree. This parable shows that we can look at the same thing from many different directions,<lb/> with each view offering an element of truth. However, we only grasp the full complexity of what<lb/> we are trying to understand when we take all perspectives together. Understanding<lb/> development success and how to achieve it holds a similar challenge. Development economists<lb/> are like the blind men examining the elephant, often only narrowly seeing one part of a bigger,<lb/> more complex picture. Few development issues exemplify this point more than the longstanding<lb/> debate over the costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).<lb/> We are approaching the 2015 deadline for achieving the MDGs in a vastly different global<lb/> economic and political climate than that in which the goals were initially formulated in 2000. In<lb/> the late 1990s, many developing countries had experienced shaky economic transitions from<lb/> socialist planning, debilitating financial crises, and in a number of cases both. Official<lb/> development assistance (ODA) budgets had shrunk since the end of the Cold War, and many<lb/> rich countries had reduced their engagement in the developing world. The MDGs proved<lb/> extremely useful at refocusing the development community on measurable, achievable and time-<lb/>bound goals. In particular, this invigorated the development co-operation efforts of OECD<lb/> countries that are members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and re-ignited<lb/> their engagement in partner countries. After a decade of declining aid budgets during the 1990s,<lb/> the MDGs helped to galvanise the international aid community to dedicate an increased amount<lb/> of resources to development co-operation in the 2000s.<lb/></p>

			<p>More than a decade later, the nature of development co-operation has changed. This<lb/> change is due to the emergence of new poles of growth in the developing world as well as<lb/> recession and increasing calls for fiscal austerity in rich countries. Partly out of necessity, sources<lb/> for financing development have diversified and include rapidly growing South-South aid, trade<lb/> and investment flows. Although aid and development co-operation still play an important,<lb/> catalytic role, there is a general recognition that aid alone cannot reduce poverty and foster<lb/> development. A number of countries have also increased their capacity to collect tax revenue and<lb/> mobilise other domestic resources as forms of development finance. Tax revenues are already<lb/> 10 times larger than ODA on the African continent even though this average hides considerable<lb/> country-to-country differences (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010).<lb/></p>

			<p>In this new context, it is timely to revisit the costing estimates that many development<lb/> agencies contributed to during the early 2000s. A fresh perspective on countries&apos; capacity to fund<lb/> additional development investment on their own is needed. The purpose of this paper is to offer<lb/> an assessment of the orders of magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs in the<lb/> developing world as a whole and compare this level with the degree of financial resources<lb/> available, domestic and external. While this paper offers a specific figure for how much<lb/> achieving the MDGs could cost, the aim is not to propose that the international community<lb/> scramble to meet this cost. Rather, these estimates should be used for understanding the size of<lb/> the problem that continues to face many countries. Although it is not an insurmountably high<lb/> amount, it is of an order of magnitude larger than the size of resources that could be raised from<lb/> development co-operation alone.<lb/></p>

			<p>The estimates presented in this paper show that achieving the first six MDGs 1<lb/></p>

			<p>globally<lb/> requires approximately USD 120 billion in additional annual expenditures on health, education<lb/> and poverty reduction worldwide. This is roughly twice the size of the potential increase in tax<lb/> revenues obtainable from improved tax collection efforts in developing countries. It is also<lb/> comparable to the size of current (net country-programmable) ODA flows. Approximately half of<lb/> the needed expenditures is in low-income countries, while the other half is needed in middle-<lb/>income countries. While middle-income countries are much more likely to afford these<lb/> additional expenditures themselves, the needs in low-income countries are concentrated in a<lb/> small group of countries that currently receive only about a quarter of ODA flows. Increased tax<lb/> revenue collection in middle-income countries is one way in which the (re)allocation of ODA<lb/> towards low-income countries that need it the most can be</p>

Environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and partnership for<lb/> development (MDG 8) are explicitly excluded, as these goals necessitate substantial contributions by<lb/> developed countries, while the first six could be conceivably achieved solely by developing countries<lb/> themselves. This paper divides the six remaining MDGs into three broad categories, looking at income<lb/> poverty (MDG 1), health (MDGs 4, 5, 6) and education (MDGs 2, 3). Gender equality is thus treated<lb/> narrowly as an education issue because one of MDG 3&apos;s key targets is gender equality in primary<lb/> education enrolment. This is admittedly unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, but is considered<lb/> necessary to maintain a sufficiently generalisable approach.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306<lb/> DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/> 13<lb/></table>

			<p>The USD 120 billion estimate is based on rough calculations (summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) that<lb/> a USD 62.1 billion &quot; financing gap &quot; should be filled in 20 low-income countries, while<lb/> USD 59.2 billion in expenditures on developmental services provision should be made in 79<lb/> other low-and middle-income countries 2<lb/></p>

			<p>The rest of this paper looks at how these estimates were obtained and what type of<lb/> caution needs to be exhibited when using these figures. Section II places these calculations in the<lb/> context of past efforts to measure MDG costs and the availability of domestic resources.<lb/> Section III presents the methods used to calculate the costs of financing poverty reduction, health<lb/> and education, as well as to calculate the scope for increasing domestic resources through<lb/> increased tax revenues. Section IV documents the results of these calculations. Section V<lb/> concludes.<lb/> . Separately, calculations show that some USD 64 billion<lb/> in additional tax revenues could be collected through improved tax effort, primarily in middle-<lb/>income countries. Unfortunately, however, the bulk of these additional resources would be<lb/> raised in countries that are already on track for achieving the MDGs.<lb/> 2.<lb/> For the purposes of this paper missing baseline data from the early 1990s and missing data from the late<lb/> 2000s are extrapolated from either trends in GDP per capita growth, or in expenditure growth, where<lb/> possible. This permits the estimation of the additional cost of MDG achievement needed in 99 countries.<lb/> While these simplifying assumptions are not ideal, they are sufficient for the purpose of estimating<lb/> broad orders of magnitude. These simplifying assumptions have been adopted to ensure the broadest<lb/> number of countries, particularly low-income fragile states, are included in the estimates in this paper,<lb/> as the aim is to compare a broad estimate of the magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs<lb/> with a broad estimate of the magnitude of extra budgetary and non-budgetary resources available to<lb/> meet the goals.<lb/></p>

			<head>II. PUTTING MDG COSTING AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE<lb/> INTO CONTEXT<lb/></head>

			<p>The most recent Global Monitoring Report (World Bank and IMF, 2011) shows that the<lb/> world is on track to reduce by half the number of people living on less than a dollar a day.<lb/> However, progress is uneven country-to-country as 17 countries in Africa are far from halving<lb/> extreme poverty. The world is also close but still has progress to make to achieve gender parity<lb/> in primary and secondary education, provide access to safe drinking water and ensure primary<lb/> education completion. At the same time it is clear that global progress is too slow on child and<lb/> maternal mortality. There still exists a need to increase efforts to improve MDG progress, and in<lb/> many cases increased financial resources are an important ingredient of this improved progress.<lb/> MDG cost estimates have been instrumental in quantifying the need for increased resources to<lb/> improve progress over the past decade, despite drawbacks and caveats with many costing<lb/> methods.<lb/> This section looks briefly at past efforts to estimate the cost of MDG achievement and the<lb/> criticisms that many of these cost estimates have faced. It shows that one of the main drawbacks<lb/> of earlier cost estimates was their implicit assumption that increased spending for MDG<lb/> achievement necessarily need come from increased aid flows. Finally, it shows that a separate<lb/> literature on the role of domestic resource mobilisation in development finance demonstrates<lb/> that countries&apos; potential for financing their own development is increasing. &quot; Tax effort &quot; is<lb/> presented as one way to measure the degree to which countries are adequately mobilising the<lb/> potential of domestic resources available.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.1. Past Efforts to Estimate the Cost of the MDGs<lb/></head>

			<p>Numerous articles and reports since the early 2000s have attempted to quantify the cost of<lb/> achieving the MDGs. A chief objective of many of these previous MDG costing exercises was to<lb/> argue for scaled-up development co-operation efforts by DAC member countries to help<lb/> development partners finance the achievement of their own MDG targets. While this paper<lb/> argues that the narrow objective of scaling-up development co-operation efforts is of limited<lb/> usefulness, particularly given the financing constraints facing many DAC member countries, it<lb/> nonetheless tries to emulate the most reasonable lessons of the approaches of past MDG costing<lb/> exercises.<lb/></p>

			<head>The 2001 Report of the High-Level Panel on<lb/></head>

			<p>Financing for Development, chaired by former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo, gave a broad<lb/> estimate that a USD 50 billion increase in annual ODA flows was needed to achieve the goals<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">United Nations, 2001</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref> from the World Bank offered two separate<lb/> calculations that arrived at figures of roughly the same size, finding it would take a<lb/> USD 54 million to USD 62 million increase in ODA to achieve the poverty reduction goal, MDG1,<lb/> or a USD 35 billion to USD 72 billion increase to achieve the education, health and environmental<lb/> goals. They argued that these separate calculations could not be added up since reducing<lb/> poverty would go a long way towards improving health and education, and improving health<lb/> and education would also directly impact reducing income poverty. The 2005 report from the<lb/> Millennium Project chaired by Jeffrey Sachs proposed gradually increasing ODA by<lb/> USD 70 billion to USD 130 billion per year so that USD 189 billion in development co-operation<lb/> efforts was going towards MDG achievement by 2015.<lb/> Previous MDG cost estimates have faced criticism from a wide circle of observers,<lb/> including from some of those who were involved in the calculations themselves. <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al.<lb/> (2002)</ref> strictly cautioned that extreme care be used interpreting their own MDG cost estimates,<lb/> and that monetary inputs are not the only, and certainly not the most important, constraint<lb/> limiting MDG achievement. <ref type="biblio">Reddy and Heuty (2005, 2006, 2008</ref>) also identified a series of<lb/> problems with the literature on costing the MDGs, including the lack of a consistent cost concept,<lb/></p>

			<table>DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> 16<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/> the absence of considerations about economies of scale in MDG achievement 3<lb/></table>

			<p>A common thread tying together many previous global MDG costing exercises is the<lb/> assumption that the main reason to quantify the cost of achieving the MDGs is to convince<lb/> donors to scale-up aid flows to developing countries. <ref type="biblio">Clemens et al. (2007)</ref> pointed out that policy<lb/> proposals derived from previous costing estimates systematically misinterpret the simple and<lb/> approximate methods of global costing exercises when they argue for scaled-up aid flows.<lb/> Arguments to scale-up aid in response to the cost estimates rely heavily on unjustified<lb/> assumptions that improved policy environments, which alleviate aid effectiveness bottlenecks,<lb/> will be forthcoming and that constraints on absorptive capacity can be overcome easily. <ref type="biblio">Easterly<lb/> (2006a, 2006b</ref>) also criticizes the assumption that increased foreign aid will lead to growth by<lb/> pointing out that arguments for scaled-up aid rely principally on outdated theories on the<lb/> relationship between aid and growth.<lb/> , and the lack of<lb/> robustness of estimates to the choice of assumptions. Other critics pointed out that MDG costing<lb/> misses the point of the MDGs themselves. For example, even one of the chief architects of the<lb/> MDGs, Jan Vandemoortele, former head of the poverty group at UNDP, pointed out that the<lb/> only correct answer to the question of how much will the MDGs cost is &quot; more &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Vandemoortele<lb/> and Roy, 2005</ref>).<lb/> Another criticism of MDG cost estimates is the difficulty in assessing &quot;joint production&quot; of<lb/> the goals. <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref> recognised this by providing two separate measures of the cost<lb/> of achieving the MDGs, which they urged should not be combined so as to avoid &quot; double-<lb/>counting. &quot; Their first calculation measures only the resources needed to achieve the poverty<lb/> reduction goal of halving poverty. This calculation assumes that poverty reduction achieved by<lb/> increased growth sufficiently increases the demand and supply of health and education services<lb/> to ensure the achievement of the health, education and environmental-related goals, as well.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref> second calculation focused instead on the individual costs of achieving the<lb/> health, education and environmental costs separately. It then assumed that improving these<lb/> human development indicators has a consequent impact on incomes, thus ensuring the<lb/> achievement of the income poverty goal.<lb/></p>

			<p>More recent studies have explicitly modelled the joint production of the goals at the<lb/> country level. For instance, the World Bank&apos;s MAMS model provides a general equilibrium<lb/> framework for countries to simulate the effect of improvements in one MDG on progress in<lb/> others (<ref type="biblio">Bourguignon et al., 2008</ref>). While this approach may be much more satisfying for<lb/> modelling MDG costing, it is impossible to scale to the global level. It is also unrealistic in a<lb/> number of countries because of the large amount of country-specific data needed. Thus, for the<lb/> purposes of the present paper, the approach used by <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref> is followed and two<lb/> 3.<lb/> Given the data limitations associated with trying to estimate the cost of MDG achievement of the global<lb/> level, many of the calculations in this paper (particularly those that are health and education<lb/> expenditure related) rely primarily on linear trend models. However, Annex 3 explores the possibility<lb/> that costs may change over time relative to countries&apos; levels of development. While this type of analysis<lb/> is preferred for country-level cost estimates, the calculations in Annex 3 indicate that cost differences<lb/> between countries at the aggregate level may cancel each other out, indicating that for the purposes of<lb/> this paper, linear extrapolation methods are acceptable.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306<lb/> DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> separate calculations are considered – one based on poverty reduction through growth, the other<lb/> based on the delivery of a number of developmental services 4<lb/></table>

			<head>II.2. Mobilising Domestic Resources for Development<lb/></head>

			<p>. Double counting is avoided by<lb/> concentrating on one set of calculations for low-income countries, and another set for middle-<lb/>income countries; the rationale behind this approach is explained below.<lb/> The Monterrey Consensus (<ref type="biblio">United Nations, 2003</ref>) recognises both the need for<lb/> developing countries to take responsibility for their own poverty reduction and for their partners<lb/> to support this endeavour with more open trade, aid and domestic policies that are coherent<lb/> with their international development aims. The Consensus underlines the importance for<lb/> development of tax, international investment, financial markets and private sector development,<lb/> aid, remittances, trade and debt. Crucially, the Monterrey consensus highlights mobilising<lb/> domestic financial resources as a critical action supporting the achievement of the Millennium<lb/> Development Goals.<lb/> While MDG costing exercises in the past may have placed the emphasis on aid as<lb/> financing for development, domestic resource mobilisation — i.e. taxes and domestic savings —<lb/> remains the primary source of sustainable MDG financing. Developing countries have made<lb/> some progress in improving tax collection in the past decade, yet half of sub-Saharan African<lb/> countries mobilise less than 17% of their GDP in tax revenues, below the minimum level<lb/> considered by the UN as necessary to achieve the MDGs. Several Asian and Latin American<lb/> countries exhibit even lower collection rates, in all tax categories. Moreover, in Africa, the<lb/> increase has been primarily driven by resource-related tax revenues in oil-producing countries.<lb/> Crisis-induced domestic revenue reductions threaten USD 12 billion of core public spending in<lb/> the poorest countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of external resources, foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries<lb/> dominates in volume terms (USD 670 billion in 2010). Yet FDI and other capital inflows to<lb/> developing countries dropped by more than 50% in 2008 and are only slowly recovering.<lb/> Remittances (USD 325 billion in 2010), funds from foundations and climate change financing are<lb/> increasingly important, as are innovative sources of financing (such as the hotly debated taxes on<lb/> currency transactions, international air transport or carbon emissions as well as new actors such<lb/> as sovereign wealth funds and private equity). Although 2009 saw record levels of ODA from<lb/> OECD countries (USD 120 billion) and aid from non-OECD countries (USD 11 billion), aid is a<lb/> decreasing share of the overall financing for development picture. Bilateral aid comprises 60-70%<lb/> of total aid and is concentrated on poor countries, with least developed countries receiving four<lb/> times as much per capita as other recipients. Education, health, water and other social sectors<lb/> absorb nearly 40% of bilateral aid. Multilateral organisations, global programmes and funds<lb/> together contribute 30-40% of all aid.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Other factors indeed influence the trajectory of poverty in individual countries, such as for example<lb/> food prices. However, for the back of the envelope calculations envisioned in this paper these impacts<lb/> are assumed to be accounted for by the real GDP per capita growth and projections that are used to<lb/> update the relevant poverty, education, or health expenditure figures.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tax revenues have been rising across the developing world over the last decade. The<lb/> average tax ratio has been increasing in Africa, arguably the most critical region to MDG<lb/> achievement, since the beginning of the 1990s. The tax ratio is defined as the total of all collected<lb/> taxes expressed as share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This ratio is important because it tells<lb/> how much tax revenue is available to a country&apos;s government, taking into account the size of the<lb/> country&apos;s economy. The increase in the average tax ratio across Africa implies that many of the<lb/> continent&apos;s economies have made noticeable progress in collecting taxes over the last two<lb/> decades. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> plots the evolution of (un-weighted) average of tax shares on the African<lb/> continent as a whole and its breakdown into different income categories. The 2010 African<lb/> Economic Outlook (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010) observed that an increase in revenue<lb/> collected on resource extraction activities in some countries has largely driven the observed<lb/> increase in the average tax share.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1: Average African Tax Share<lb/> Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Classifying African countries according to their level of income shows three different<lb/> trends in tax ratios. The tax share of upper-middle-income countries is slowly converging with<lb/> the tax share of OECD countries, to nearly 35%. Lower-middle income countries have a tax share<lb/> comparable to other countries from other continents in the same income category, over 25% at<lb/> pre-crisis levels. Low-income countries have a much lower ratio, below 20%.<lb/> Taxes per capita correspond to the total of all collected taxes divided by the number of<lb/> inhabitants. In general, taxes per capita have been increasing in Africa throughout the last two<lb/> decades, although in low-income countries (LICs) the increase has been modest. Taxes per capita<lb/> provide an intuitive measure of the amount of tax revenue available on average to the<lb/> government for each inhabitant. In other words, it is the amount of tax money available for the<lb/> government to spend on everything ranging from building roads to providing public education<lb/> on average for each inhabitant.<lb/></p>

It is noteworthy that albeit<lb/> remaining very low, this amount has been rising steadily. However, it is difficult to envision any<lb/> sort of consequential public service delivery with an annual public budget corresponding to an<lb/> average of USD 35 for each inhabitant. At the other end of the spectrum, in countries such as<lb/> Equatorial Guinea, Libya and the Seychelles, taxes reach over USD 3 000 per inhabitant. In 2008<lb/> Equatorial Guinea collected as much as USD 5 317 per inhabitant. In 2009 this amount had<lb/> dropped back to USD 3 806.<lb/> Figure 3: Absolute Resource Taxes<lb/> Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010).<lb/></figure>

			<p>As highlighted by AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010), the fiscal performance of the middle-<lb/>income African countries is highly linked to the international prices of natural resources. The<lb/> effect of fluctuating resource prices since 2008 and onwards throughout the crisis can be seen in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, which shows the fiscal revenue from resource taxes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The degree to which these domestic resources can be scaled-up can be broadly estimated<lb/> given some general assumptions. It has been well documented, including by the African Economic<lb/> Outlook (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010) and the Perspective on <ref type="biblio">Global Development 2012 (OECD,<lb/> 2011</ref>) that there is increasing scope for mobilising domestic resources in developing countries.<lb/> The next section, following a summary of the methods used to calculate the aggregate costs for<lb/> achieving the MDGs, describes tax effort calculations (<ref type="biblio">Piancastelli, 2001; Bird et al., 2004 and<lb/> 2008</ref>).

			<head>III. METHODS FOR COSTING MDG ACHIEVEMENT<lb/> AND MEASURING DOMESTIC RESOURCES<lb/></head>

			<p>This section examines three types of calculations on which this paper rests. The section<lb/> first looks at the &quot; financing gap &quot; calculation, which is used to calculate the amount of additional<lb/> capital an economy needs to maintain a target growth rate. This target growth rate will be shown<lb/> to differ for each country according to the amount of growth in per capita income or<lb/> consumption that will be needed to halve the number of people living on a dollar a day,<lb/> assuming distribution-neutral growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>As shown in the previous section and as pointed out by <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref>, the<lb/> &quot; financing gap &quot; calculation should not be aggregated with other calculations of health and<lb/> education costs to avoid &quot; double counting &quot; due to the possible &quot; joint production &quot; of MDG<lb/> achievement. Unlike <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref>, however, this paper considers an alternative poverty<lb/> gap-based estimate of the cost for achieving MDG 1 which, this paper argues, can be aggregated<lb/> with the health and education cost estimates. This alternative measure will be shown to be<lb/> equivalent to a cash transfer that aims to provide enough income support to halve the number of<lb/> people living on less than a dollar a-day by 2015. In this way, like <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref>, this<lb/> paper offers two separate approaches for calculating the cost of MDG achievement.<lb/> This section thus looks secondly at how to estimate the cost of MDG achievement through<lb/> scaling-up service delivery in order to avoid the &quot; double counting &quot; issue highlighted in the<lb/> previous section. The cost of MDG achievement is the sum of estimates of the &quot; poverty gap &quot; to<lb/> measure the cash transfer needed to achieve MDG 1, of estimates of education expenditures<lb/> needed to achieve MDGs 2 and 3 and of estimates of health expenditures needed to achieve<lb/> MDGs 4, 5, and 6. Finally, this section explores how estimates of tax effort can be used to<lb/> calculate how much government revenues could be increased through improved tax collection to<lb/> meet the needs identified by the MDG cost estimates.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.1. Overcoming the Limits of the &quot; Financing Gap &quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>MDG 1 is expected to be met because the Millennium Declaration posed the MDGs as<lb/> global goals, not individual country goals. Thanks in large part to strong growth in China, world<lb/> poverty will be halved by 2015. However, if the MDGs are monitored at the country level, the<lb/> simplest way to disaggregate responsibility for achieving the global goal is by expecting each<lb/> country to halve their own poverty headcount themselves. From this point of view, a number of<lb/> countries will still be lagging behind on MDG 1 by 2015. To estimate the amount of additional<lb/> resources needed by 2015 to achieve a poverty headcount ratio that is half of 1990 levels, this<lb/></p>

			<head>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective<lb/></head>

			<table>DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> 22<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/> paper relies on two very different approaches. This first section looks at the &quot; financing gap &quot;<lb/> calculation that has underpinned many of the previous MDG calculations.<lb/></table>

			<p>The &quot; financing gap &quot; refers to the difference between the investment requirements an<lb/> economy needs to achieve a targeted growth rate and the actual investment resources available<lb/> through domestic or external sources of financing. The gap itself is calculated using a simple<lb/> Harrod-Domar growth model that defines a mechanistic relationship between capital and<lb/> growth. Many of the criticisms of previous MDG estimates cite drawbacks in the Harrod-Domar<lb/> growth model and in particular in its later variation, the &quot; two-gap &quot; growth model, formulated<lb/> by Chenery and Strout (1966).<lb/></p>

			<p>The workhorse model of early development economics, developed by Harrod (1939) and<lb/> Domar (1946) and used for much of the post-war period, permits calculating the amount of<lb/> additional resources an economy needs to obtain a specified target growth rate given savings<lb/> rates and a fixed capital-output ratio. The approach gained appeal in the immediate post-war<lb/> period as a useful way to study temporary shortages of capital, such as that experienced by<lb/> Europe during its reconstruction under the Marshall Plan. As a way of quantifying the amount of<lb/> capital needed to generate growth, the Harrod-Domar model helped quantify not only the costs<lb/> of European reconstruction, but also the investments needed to stimulate growth under socialist<lb/> five-year plans, such as those prepared by China, India and the Soviet Union.<lb/></p>

			<p>An appealing feature of the Harrod-Domar model was its compatibility with the notion<lb/> that capital accumulation was a precondition for a country&apos;s &quot; take-off &quot; into economic<lb/> development, such as <ref type="biblio">Rostow (1956, 1959</ref>) theorised. This &quot; take-off &quot; can be delivered as a &quot; big<lb/> push &quot; of externally financed investment needed to spark industrialisation, as envisioned by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Rosenstein-Rodan (1943, 1961</ref>). The intuition that capital accumulation was a key constraint to<lb/> economic development conveniently lent itself to models justifying foreign aid. In the early post-<lb/>war period, the principal justification for foreign aid to developing countries relied on the belief<lb/> that aid could raise a country&apos;s growth rate to a level sufficiently high to ensure Rostow&apos;s &quot; take-<lb/>off &quot; in order to push the country out of a poverty trap and propel it into a pattern of self-<lb/>sustaining growth. Chenery and Strout (1966) thus re-formulated the Harrod-Domar model as<lb/> the &quot; two-gap &quot; model, explicitly in terms of two types of financing gap, a &quot; savings-investment<lb/> gap &quot; and a &quot; trade gap, &quot; measuring the ability of countries to maintain target growth rates given<lb/> their savings rates and their trade balances. Importantly, these gaps were theorised to be filled by<lb/> foreign aid (<ref type="biblio">Chenery and Strout, 1966</ref>).<lb/> The main problem with using financing gap models to cost the MDGs is not the models<lb/> themselves but the assumption that the gap should be filled by aid alone. For instance, reflecting<lb/> on some of the criticism of earlier studies that argue aid should be scaled-up, Guillaumont and<lb/> Guillaumont-Jeanneney (2007) pointedly observed: &quot; The main argument for doubling aid is not<lb/> simply to fill a financial gap, but to push countries out of the stagnation trap which will be<lb/> impossible to escape otherwise. <ref type="biblio">[...]</ref> The criticism then is an attack against the idea of a trap and<lb/> its big push corollary. &quot; The assumption that a &quot; big push &quot; of aid stimulates growth in a<lb/> mechanistic way is problematic and has been cited as a limitation of the previous MDG costing<lb/> exercises detailed in Section II. For instance, Easterly (2006a, 2006b) pointed out that this &quot; big<lb/> push &quot; theory ignores a number of issues that are crucial to making aid effective, such as<lb/> institutional quality and absorptive capacity. With regard to this critique, Guillaumont and<lb/></p>

			<figure>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306<lb/> DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/> 23<lb/></figure>

			<p>Guillaumont-Jeanneney (2007) noted, &quot; Other critical opinions or reservations – mostly with<lb/> regard to the notion of absorptive capacity – are intended to highlight all the reasons why<lb/> increased aid is likely to be useless, wasted or even harmful. &quot; In other words, the criticism is<lb/> aimed not at the financing gap model itself, but rather at the extension that it should be filled by<lb/> aid.<lb/></p>

			<p>Criticisms notwithstanding, it is possible to shed the assumption that the big push should<lb/> come from aid alone and still harvest the financing gap calculations based on a Harrod-Domar<lb/> model as a useful construct. This is particularly true if the purpose is to obtain an approximate<lb/> size of resources – whether domestic or external in origin – that would be needed to achieve a<lb/> target growth rate. Importantly, the financing gap calculations themselves do not have to<lb/> distinguish whether additional resources come from either aid increases or from elsewhere. In<lb/> fact, the simplicity of the model used in this paper may be its strength: the only determinant of<lb/> how investment resources are turned into growth in this model is the mechanistic relationship<lb/> between capital and output, labelled θ, the incremental capital output ratio. For the purposes of<lb/> this paper, this ratio is determined by how much investment has led to growth in output over the<lb/> period since 1990. Hence, it varies greatly between different countries, and it is loosely related to<lb/> the effectiveness of policies and institutions, including the business climate, and the historical<lb/> experiences of each of the countries under consideration.<lb/></p>

			<p>To determine the target growth rate that will be used for this paper&apos;s calculations, the first<lb/> step consists of estimating how much consumption or income growth will be needed to raise<lb/> average incomes high enough to halve poverty by 2015. It is therefore assumed that inequality<lb/> stays constant over the period, and the most recent distributional parameters can be used. These<lb/> parameters define the points along each country&apos;s Lorenz curve. Methods developed by Datt<lb/> (1998) can be applied to determine how much growth in mean incomes or consumption<lb/> contributes to poverty reduction. Once the target growth rate needed to achieve the poverty<lb/> reduction target is obtained, it can be plugged into a simple Harrod-Domar model that then<lb/> determines the amount of resources needed to achieve the target growth rate, y, as a function of<lb/> the following variables:<lb/> í µí±¦ í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±(í µí± í µí±í µí±£í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí¼, í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼, í µí±í µí±í µí±, í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ)<lb/></p>

			<p>Using the 2009 values for savings rates, aid, FDI, and population growth, and the<lb/> estimated value for θ, the incremental capital-output ratio, the only variable left unidentified is<lb/> the &quot; additional resources &quot; term. Terms can therefore be re-arranged to calculate the amount of<lb/> additional resources needed. 5<lb/></p>

			<head>III.2. MDG Achievement through Service Delivery<lb/></head>

			<p>DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> question. Instead of looking at how much additional resources are needed to stimulate growth,<lb/> the extra income the poor need to halve the number of poor by 2015 is estimated. The poverty<lb/> gap (<ref type="biblio">Foster et al., 1984</ref>) measure is a poverty indicator that measures the mean proportionate<lb/> shortfall (z-yi) from the poverty line (z) for a given population (n):<lb/></p>

			<p>Multiplying the poverty gap by the poverty line (z) and the total population (n) thus gives<lb/> an aggregate measure of the total transfer required to eliminate poverty in a given country for a<lb/> given distribution. The poverty gap is also easily computable from the parameters of the Lorenz<lb/> curve the poverty headcount, mean income, and the poverty line, z, following Datt (1998).<lb/> The poverty gap associated with the mean income and poverty headcount obtained<lb/> under a &quot; business as usual &quot; growth scenario through 2015 -based on the most recent World<lb/> Economic Outlook projections from the IMF-can be compared to the poverty gap of a distribution<lb/> associated with the target growth scenario calculated for the financing gap calculation above.<lb/> The difference between the predicted and the targeted poverty gaps in 2015 can then be used to<lb/> calculate the aggregate transfer that will be needed every year to keep sufficient numbers of poor<lb/> people out of poverty to assure that the poverty headcount is half its 1990 levels:<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Calculating Expenditure to Meet Education-related Goals (MDGs 2 &amp; 3)<lb/></head>

			<p>The cost of achieving universal primary education is estimated using the method<lb/> proposed by <ref type="biblio">Delamonica et al. (2001)</ref>. Based on country-specific unit cost estimation of primary<lb/> education, this study projected the annual additional cost of reaching a net enrolment ratio equal<lb/> to 100% for primary education by 2015. According to the definition of the United Nations&apos;<lb/> Statistics Division, the net enrolment rate (NER) in primary education is the number of children<lb/> of official primary school age who are enrolled in primary education as a percentage of the total<lb/> children of the official school age population. Some authors, e.g. <ref type="biblio">Glewwe and Zhao (2006)</ref>, argue<lb/> that keeping children enrolled in primary education until completion is a major constraint for<lb/> universal completion of primary education, for instance when there exist outside options for<lb/> children to enter the labour force or contribute to work at home. However, the simplifying<lb/> assumption made here is that achieving universal enrolment in primary education would lead to<lb/> universal completion of primary education if other MDGs are met. For instance, if poverty is also<lb/> reduced significantly, it can be argued that the reservation wage available to children who do not<lb/> complete primary schooling is less likely to be significant.<lb/></p>

			<p>To calculate the number of students to be schooled, two hypotheses are made about the<lb/> future baseline trend of net enrolment rates. First, the baseline scenario assumes that NERs<lb/> remain constant at the 2009 level,<lb/> on primary<lb/> education come from UNESCO and the World Bank. Population census and projections are taken<lb/> from the United Nations&apos; World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision (United Nations,<lb/> Population Division).

To assess how much education expenditure needs to be spent to achieve universal<lb/> primary education, baseline spending on education must first be estimated under reasonable<lb/> assumptions about future net enrolment rates. To project public expenditure, real public<lb/> expenditure per student on primary education until 2015 is assumed to remain the same as in<lb/> 2009. Differences thus exist across countries, as there are countries and regions where the<lb/> expenditure per student is higher than in others. These differences can reflect variations in the<lb/> cost of providing a constant quality of education or, alternatively, of variations in the quality of<lb/> primary education across regions and countries. It is beyond the scope of this paper to separate<lb/> these two effects because the quality of education is not explicitly an MDG, while universal<lb/> primary enrolment is.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Calculating Expenditure to Meet Health-related Goals (MDGs 4, 5, &amp; 6)<lb/></head>

			<p>Health-related MDGs include reducing child mortality (MDG 4), improving maternal<lb/> health (MDG 5), and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other pandemic diseases (MDG 6).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Devarajan et al. (2002)</ref> argued that adding up the costs of achieving the different health goals<lb/> could lead to their overestimation because the different goals are highly interconnected. On the<lb/> other hand, it can be argued that there is also a risk of underestimating these costs considering<lb/> the weak relation between public spending and health outcomes as shown by <ref type="biblio">Filmer et al. (2000)</ref>.<lb/> According to the World Health Organization (2010), ensuring access to the types of interventions<lb/> and treatments needed to address MDGs 4, 5 and 6 requires on average &quot; little more than<lb/> USD 60 per capita <ref type="biblio">[annually]</ref> by 2015. &quot;<lb/> Of course, it is legitimate to wonder how realistic it is to assume that USD 60 per capita<lb/> would be the amount of health expenditure required to meet health-related MDGs in all<lb/> developing countries. For instance, calculations that are explained further in Annex 3 show that<lb/> in low income countries the effect on child mortality of increases in health is insignificant. For<lb/> lower-middle income countries, in contrast, the effect is strong and very significant while for<lb/> upper-middle income countries, the effect is somewhat strong and still very significant. This S-<lb/>shaped health input-outcome relationship is consistent with the literature (see a discussion in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Klasen and Lange, 2011</ref>). The implication is that for low-income countries, it is not even clear that<lb/> expenditure on top of USD 60 per capita would necessarily lead to health outcomes compatible<lb/> with attaining health-related MDGs essentially because of absorptive capacity issues. As for<lb/> middle income countries, USD 60 per capita is probably an underestimate of the cost of meeting<lb/> health-related MDGs in upper-middle countries. The reasons are twofold: the cost of health<lb/> provision is correlated with the general price level and health outcomes become more expensive<lb/> to attain the more advanced in health a country gets. Calculations explained in Annex 3 lead to<lb/> estimates of a USD 83.4 per capita only to meet the child mortality MDG (MDG 4) in lower-<lb/>middle income countries, and USD 288.1 per capita in upper middle income countries.<lb/> This paper, however, sticks to WHO&apos;s USD 60 per capita estimate not only because the<lb/> virtue of its simplicity and transparency but also because it is questionable whether health-<lb/>related MDGs are as meaningful in middle-income countries as in lower-income countries. In<lb/></p>

Such priority may not actually require<lb/> spending per capita significantly above USD 60 per capita. What this discussion implies,<lb/> however, is that more effort has to be devoted to understanding and addressing inequalities with<lb/> respect to health outcomes in middle income countries.<lb/></table>

			<p>With the USD 60 per capita target maintained, to calculate how much additional<lb/> expenditure will be required globally to meet this threshold, baseline spending on health first<lb/> needs to be estimated under reasonable assumptions about future spending. The current level of<lb/> government spending on health is projected up to 2015 for 128 developing countries for which<lb/> data is available. <ref type="biblio">Data</ref> for per capita total expenditure on health come from the WHO. IMF World<lb/> Economic Outlook data, April 2011 edition forecasts are used for GDP growth projections between<lb/> 2011 and 2015. These costs per inhabitant are multiplied by population projections coming from<lb/> the United Nations&apos; World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision (United Nations, Population<lb/> Division).<lb/> Two different baseline scenarios are analysed:<lb/> i) Linear Scenario: initial per capita expenditure for health in 2009 8<lb/> ii) Constant Scenario: initial per capita expenditure for health in 2009 remains constant.<lb/> grows at the same rate<lb/> as per capita real GDP growth projection for each year;<lb/></figure>

			<p>The linear scenario can be thought of as a more realistic estimate of the growth of future<lb/> expenditure while the constant scenario serves more as a minimum estimate. Indeed,<lb/> calculations explained in more details in Annex 3 show that the elasticity of health expenditure<lb/> with respect to GDP while positive and statistically significant is below 1 for all developing<lb/> countries in general. For low income countries it stands at 0.81, for lower middle-income<lb/> countries at 0.89 and for upper-middle income countries at 0.95. The richer the country the more<lb/> elastic is the health expenditure with respects to GDP. Thus, the linear scenario probably<lb/> overestimates the growth health expenditure in low-income countries and therefore<lb/> underestimating their corresponding gap by 2015.

			<head>III.3. Estimating the Scope for Scaling-up Domestic Resources Mobilisation<lb/></head>

			<p>Once estimates of the costs to achieve the MDGs – calculated as the &quot; financing gap &quot; or as<lb/> the cost of service provision as defined in the two preceding sections – are available, a natural<lb/> step consists in estimating the degree to which countries can scale-up the mobilisation of their<lb/> own domestic resources to finance the local achievement of MDGs. This paper adopts the<lb/> techniques used by Piancastelli (2001) and <ref type="biblio">Bird et al. (2004; 2008)</ref> to calculate &quot; tax effort &quot; in<lb/> developing countries. Their tax effort index is calculated to compare predicted tax revenues to<lb/> actual tax revenues and to estimate how much extra tax revenue may be collected if a country<lb/> improves tax collection.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Empirically, taxes as a share of GDP can be shown to depend on the economy&apos;s level of<lb/> development, on the share of the economy that is formal or industrialised and on the openness of<lb/> the economy to trade. Generally, higher levels of development and higher levels of openness<lb/> coincide with higher levels of tax collection.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. RESULTS OF COST ESTIMATES AND DOMESTIC RESOURCE<lb/> MEASUREMENT<lb/></head>

			<p>This section presents the figures that lead us to postulate that the cost for achieving the<lb/> MDGs equals approximately USD 120 billion in additional resources annually. It is important to<lb/> note that this amount is roughly twice the amount of domestic resources that developing<lb/> countries are estimated to be able to raise through increased tax revenues. Moreover, there is a<lb/> mismatch between the countries where additional domestic resources can typically be mobilised<lb/> and where the financing needs to meet the MDGs are. While half the required financing is<lb/> estimated to be needed in middle-income countries, most of the USD 64 billion in potential<lb/> increase in domestic resource mobilisation (potential increase in tax revenues) is concentrated in<lb/> middle-income countries that are not lagging behind on MDG progress.<lb/> This section first reviews the estimated cost of achieving the MDGs through filling the<lb/> financing gap. Second, this section looks at the estimated cost of achieving the MDGs through<lb/> increased delivery of development services in the form of expenditure increases on cash<lb/> transfers, health and education. Third, the results of the tax effort calculations are then reviewed<lb/> and used to show why, although substantial, scope for increased tax collection will have little<lb/> immediate impact on MDG achievement. Finally, this section explains why the financing gap<lb/> calculations are used for low-income countries while the service provision calculations are used<lb/> for middle-income countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.1. The Cost of Filling the &quot; Financing Gap &quot;<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the results of the financing gap calculations by region and by income<lb/> group. Taken at face value, the financing gap calculations reflect a need for more than<lb/> USD 200 billion in additional resources annually to achieve the MDGs. The bulk of these<lb/> additional resources is estimated to be required in middle-income countries. However, as<lb/> explained in Section I, this paper relies on the financing gap calculations for estimating the cost<lb/> estimate of achieving the MDGs in low-income countries, where a financing gap exists.<lb/> Therefore, out of the more than USD 200 billion financing gap worldwide, only the<lb/> USD 62 billion gap in low-income countries is considered to be a credible estimate of the cost of<lb/> achieving the MDGs in these countries. This is for a number of reasons explained below.<lb/> The East Asia and the South Asia regions have minimal additional capital requirements<lb/> to achieve the target growth rates needed to halve poverty, reflecting the significant progress<lb/> these regions have already made on MDG 1 over the last decade. However, the Latin America<lb/> and Caribbean and the sub-Saharan Africa regions require significant amounts of additional<lb/> capital to achieve enough growth to halve poverty. The amount of total additional resources<lb/></p>

(2002). This is primarily because this paper<lb/> calculates the financing gap for a broader sample of countries. In Devarajan et al. (ibid.), countries<lb/> that are not on track to achieve the MDGs but for which increases in aid will not significantly<lb/> impact growth rates – for instance, Colombia, Venezuela and Haiti – are explicitly excluded from<lb/> calculations. The argument is that these countries include a number of countries that receive<lb/> small amounts of aid relative to GDP and have relatively high average income or consumption<lb/> but highly unequal distributions of incomes and thus a high number of poor.<lb/> Table 3: The Total Additional Capital Requirement Needed to Achieve MDG 1<lb/> Growth Targets (i.e. the &quot; Financing Gap &quot; ) as Estimated by a Simple Harrod-Domar Model<lb/> (USD billion)<lb/> Minimum<lb/> Maximum<lb/> East Asia &amp; Pacific<lb/> .13<lb/> .13<lb/> Europe &amp; Central Asia<lb/> 7.6<lb/> 10<lb/> Latin America &amp; Caribbean<lb/> 130<lb/> 170<lb/> Middle East &amp; North Africa<lb/> 8.3<lb/> 8.5<lb/> South Asia<lb/> .94<lb/> 1.9<lb/> Sub-Saharan Africa<lb/> 72<lb/> 89<lb/> Minimum<lb/> Maximum<lb/> Low income<lb/> 37<lb/> 62<lb/> Lower-middle income<lb/> 70<lb/> 78<lb/> Upper-middle income<lb/> 110<lb/> 140<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; calculations.<lb/></table>

			<p>Countries where reasonable increases of ODA will be inconsequential to growth are left<lb/> in the sample intentionally; the focus of this paper is on the total amount of resources needed,<lb/> whether those resources come from aid or other sources of finrancing. Doing so also highlights a<lb/> key result of the present exercise: those countries with the greatest growth financing needs are<lb/> indeed those countries where increasing aid has the smallest effect on growth. Leaving in such<lb/> countries drives up the cost of meeting MDG 1 and may go against the original spirit of MDGs<lb/> that were meant to be met at the global level, however. Indeed, <ref type="biblio">Colombia</ref> and Venezuela have<lb/> neither the largest number of poor people in the world nor even the largest share of poor in their<lb/> populations. These economies simply are some of the most unequal and have been historically<lb/> some of the least responsive to investment and aid as captured by the long-term values of the<lb/> incremental capital-output ratio estimated over the period 1990-2015.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The role of inequality cannot be overstated in the explanation of the large financing gaps<lb/> in Latin American countries. In addition to the lack of productivity of capital investment<lb/> reflected in a high incremental capital-output ratio, these countries also face a very low growth<lb/> elasticity of poverty reduction. This is because high inequality mutes the impact of growth on<lb/></p>

			<table>DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> 32<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/> poverty reduction (Bourguignon, 2003). Taking Colombia as an example, out of USD 1 million<lb/> growth in national income, on average only USD 8 800 goes to the poorest 10%, whereas<lb/> USD 462 000 to the richest 10%. In other words, to get USD 8 800 to the poorest, the simple<lb/> Harrod-Domar model used in this paper requires that USD 462 000 be granted to the richest<lb/> through growth because it postulates distribution-neutral growth.<lb/></table>

			<p>Nonetheless, many of these countries have significantly high income per capita and could<lb/> conceivably reduce poverty through redistribution. The needs in upper-middle-income countries<lb/> and in much of Latin America stem less from the absolute needs of poor populations than they<lb/> do from the inefficient market structure of those countries – captured by high incremental<lb/> capital-output ratios and low savings rates and/or by high inequality, which is reflected by<lb/> relatively high mean incomes but large numbers of poor people. Obviously, using fiscal policy to<lb/> make growth more inclusive and combating poverty through public spending targeted at lower-<lb/>income groups may be more propitious than reducing poverty through increased growth in the<lb/> current conditions prevailing in these countries. This possibility is considered in the following<lb/> section, which looks at the cost of income transfers to the poor that could help achieve MDG 1 as<lb/> part of a broader programme of service delivery.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.2.The Cost of Development Service Provision<lb/> 1. Income Transfers to the Poor to Fill the Poverty Gap<lb/></head>

			<p>The additional resources needed to increase average incomes enough to reduce poverty<lb/> by the amount required to achieve MDG 1 are, in many cases, substantial. Of course, these<lb/> calculations are highly troublesome, for a number of the reasons outlined above. Interestingly,<lb/> contrary to the results of the growth exercise in Section A, the poverty gap calculation shows that<lb/> the greatest absolute need of the poor – in terms of the amount by which their incomes are on<lb/> average below the poverty line – is in sub-Saharan Africa and is spread more or less evenly<lb/> between low-income and lower-middle-income countries.<lb/> This transfer is calculated for the 35 countries that are not on track to achieve MDG 1<lb/> according to the financing gap calculations above, where the distributional data and the IMF<lb/> projections are available. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, the total aggregate transfer to the poor required to<lb/> achieve MDG 1 is estimated to be USD 9.8 billion at purchasing power parity terms (that is,<lb/> USD 4.9 billion at market exchange rates). It is important to note, however, that these transfers<lb/> are hypothesised to be perfectly targeted and do not include administration or transaction costs.<lb/> Accordingly, they represent an extreme lower bound to the amount of additional resources<lb/> required to achieve MDG 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financing gap calculations assume poverty is to be reduced through distribution-<lb/>neutral growth that, in turn, spurs production of the other human development outcomes<lb/> captured by the rest of the MDGs. In contrast, the poverty gap calculations approach poverty<lb/> reduction in a more limited manner. Reaching MDG 1 through the targeted cash transfers<lb/> implied by such calculations suggests individual transfers going to the poor people who are<lb/> closest to the poverty line. These transfers would therefore go only to smallest number of people<lb/> necessary to ensure that the headcount ratio is halved. All other things remaining equal, this type<lb/> of transfer would actually increase inequality. Indeed, the poor as a group – i.e. those still poor<lb/> after the transfer – would be on average more deeply poor – i.e. farther from the poverty line –<lb/> than the poor as a group were before. Accordingly, this estimate is a lower bound on the order of<lb/> magnitude of the costs of MDG 1 achievement, rather than a concrete proposal for MDG 1<lb/> achievement through cash transfers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the hypothesis that government expenditure on education stays constant and all<lb/> increases come from additional resources, amongst 90 countries 10<lb/> 10.

			<p>Under the alternative scenario, where NERs follow their linear trend during the<lb/> preceding decade, the additional spending required in 2015 to achieve universal primary<lb/> education is estimated to be USD 6.9 billion. This projection shows that a continuation of current<lb/> efforts to increase NERs makes a significant difference to the cost of achieving universal primary<lb/> enrolment with expenditure shortfall reduced by USD 1.9 billion in 2015. A wait-and-see attitude<lb/> is not advisable, however, because there is no guarantee that NERs will keep rising at the same<lb/> pace they have during the last decade without additional increases in educational investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The underlying challenge is that substantial heterogeneity exists among countries within<lb/> each region, so that regional averages do not portray well how much spending has to rise in<lb/> individual countries within a region. Universal primary education may be within reach at the<lb/> regional level even if it remains a distant prospect in individual countries. The required absolute<lb/> change and rate of increase in spending on education in some countries can be very high, and<lb/></p>

			<figure>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306<lb/> DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/> 35<lb/></figure>

			<p>there is no reason to expect that countries from the region with higher budgets and/or closer to<lb/> achieving universal primary enrolment would subsidise countries with smaller budgets<lb/> 11<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, it is important to point out that these costs do not capture the economies of<lb/> scale implicit in achieving universal primary enrolment. These results are conditioned by the<lb/> assumption that the cost per student remains constant as NERs are raised towards 100%.<lb/> However, it is reasonable to assume that required expenditure per student rises the closer a<lb/> country gets to universal enrolment. Generally speaking, it should be more costly to raise the<lb/> share of enrolled students when enrolment is close to universal than when few students are<lb/> enrolled. For instance, providing schooling in remote areas is typically more challenging than it<lb/> is in major urban centres. Along the same lines, the absolute cost of achieving universal primary<lb/> education in Latin America and Caribbean is of the same order of magnitude as in sub-Saharan<lb/> Africa despite a much smaller population of school age. This is because while Latin America and<lb/> Caribbean is closer to achieving universal primary enrolment, the cost per student is much<lb/> higher in Latin America and Caribbean than in sub-Saharan Africa.<lb/> .<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Expenditure Required to Achieve Health-related MDGs<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<figure>total spending required to meet health-related MDGs is calculated based on the<lb/> estimates from the World Health Organization (2010). According to these estimates, a little more<lb/> than USD 60 per capita will be required by 2015 to achieve health-related MDGs. The level of<lb/> expenditure per capita is assumed to rise linearly from its current level to USD 60 per capita by<lb/> 2015. This figure is multiplied by the projected size of the population.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> below shows average total expenditure per capita by income group and by<lb/> region. While assuming a constant cost per capita to meet all three health MDGs is a convenient<lb/> and transparent simplifying assumption, a limitation of this section&apos;s calculations is that the cost<lb/> of meeting health-related goals is likely to be underestimated in some countries. For instance, of<lb/> all three goals, improvements in maternal health are those associated with the highest costs.<lb/> Further, achieving a goal such as reducing infant mortality is bound to get more expensive the<lb/> closer a country is to completing the goal.<lb/> 11. Separate calculations show that, taken together, the countries with an education expenditure shortfall<lb/> would need to increase spending on education by 7.4% in 2015 compared to baseline expenditures. On<lb/> the face of it, such rate of increase sounds achievable. However, this kind of calculation implicitly<lb/> assumes that spending on education can be funded at the global level and allocated to countries where<lb/> it is needed to achieve universal primary enrolment. Indeed, at the regional level, the level of increase in<lb/> spending required looks more challenging: sub-Saharan Africa requires the largest proportional<lb/> increase, 22.3%, in the amount projected to be spent in 2015. The Middle East and North Africa comes<lb/> next, with 8.2%.<lb/></p>

			<p>The constant expenditure scenario illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> is this paper&apos;s upper-bound<lb/> estimate on the order of magnitude for financial resources necessary to reach the health-MDGs. It<lb/> is this upper-bound that is used for the total service delivery cost estimates, combined with the<lb/> corresponding upper-bound estimate for education, and the market exchange rate amount<lb/> needed for the poverty transfer. As explained above, these three costs can be added and<lb/> compared with the cost estimate derived from the &quot; financing gap &quot; calculations.<lb/> As explained in Section IV.1, there is a strong argument against using the &quot; financing gap &quot;<lb/> calculation for middle-income countries, given the high levels of inequality and high capital-<lb/>output ratios observed in the middle-income countries that are not on track to achieve the MDGs.<lb/> Development service delivery can be considered the more cost-effective way to achieve the goals<lb/> in these middle-income countries.

			<p>The values shown in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> correspond to more than USD 64 billion in potential tax<lb/> revenue available in the developing world. As shown in Sections IV.1 and IV.2, the additional<lb/> resources needed to achieve the MDGs could constitute approximately twice this amount. This<lb/> raises the question as to whether and to what extent some emerging countries are in a position<lb/> both to increase their tax revenues and to scale up their own contributions to development co-<lb/>operation and investment in other developing countries. Indeed, discussions among the<lb/> development partners at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea,<lb/> have highlighted the unique and growing importance of such South-South aid flows.<lb/> Importantly, while attempts can be made to compare these flows to ODA from traditional<lb/> partners, the discussions at Busan underscored the fact that the principles, commitments and<lb/> actions agreed among development partners with respect to traditional ODA are only a reference<lb/> for South-South partners on a voluntary basis. Therefore it is interesting to speculate the manner<lb/> with tax effort below 1 and compares the level<lb/> of domestic resources with ODA and FDI. Mexico is the country with the largest potential for an<lb/> increase in domestic resources through improved tax collection. It is interesting to note that<lb/> while Mexico still requires increases in educational spending to achieve the MDGs according to<lb/> the calculations in Section IV.2, the magnitude of the needed expenditures is only in the<lb/> hundreds of millions, while the potential tax resources that could be increased is on the order of<lb/> tens of billions. Notably, the other countries with the largest potential – Russia and Kazakhstan--<lb/>are not struggling to achieve the MDGs. This said, Colombia – which is struggling more than<lb/> Mexico – has the fourth largest potential to increase resources. In fact, the potential for increasing<lb/> tax resources in Colombia is large enough to cover the poverty gap and the increased educational<lb/> expenditures the country would require according to the calculations described in Section IV.2.<lb/> 12. Iran, Bhutan, El Salvador, Thailand, Pakistan, Panama and Costa Rica are excluded because complete<lb/> data was not available for these countries.<lb/></p>

Accordingly, it is not surprising that the scale<lb/> of additional tax resources available in middle income countries can cover the cost of MDG-<lb/>related service needs calculated in the previous sections. This is not true of the size of potential<lb/> additional tax resources in low-income countries, which in no case can cover the service related<lb/> MDG costs nor the financing gap cost. It therefore does not appear likely that domestic resource<lb/> mobilisation can make a significant contribution to filling the resource gap in the low-income<lb/> countries with the largest relative needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the grim picture depicted above with respect to the scope for increased domestic<lb/> resources in low-income countries that have an MDG resource need, it must be noted that<lb/> conclusions drawn above owe a lot to the simplified nature of the calculations in question. These<lb/> results should only be interpreted as providing a first-cut of such calculations rather than the<lb/> ultimate answer, particularly on a country-by-country basis. There may be additional scope for<lb/> raising revenue in some countries, if the analysis was instead performed with detailed country-<lb/>level data.<lb/> Finally, given that the MDGs have 2015 as their deadline, it is also important to note that<lb/> raising additional revenue is a time-consuming task and can pose particular challenges to low-<lb/>income countries with limited administrative capacity. Determined efforts would need to be<lb/> made to overcome the inherent difficulty of raising additional revenue in such a short time<lb/> period, and given capacity constraints as well as governance issues. For example, if<lb/> improvements in tax collection focus too much on natural resource rents, there is a risk that<lb/> reversals in commodity prices might adversely affect revenue mobilisation and endanger<lb/> progress on the MDGs.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.4. Mixing cost estimates without double-counting<lb/></head>

			<p>Throughout this paper, two separate sets of MDG cost estimates have been entertained.<lb/> The results presented in Section IV.1 are based on the premise that &quot; a rising tide lifts all boats &quot;<lb/> and that economic growth at a sufficiently high rate can spur development success, particularly<lb/> in other human development outcomes captured by the MDGs. In contrast, the results presented<lb/> Section IV.2 are founded on the simple argument that improving public expenditures on service<lb/> delivery can lead to MDG achievement. In both cases, the link implicitly assumed between<lb/> public expenditure and social outcomes is admittedly naïve and, thus the connection made<lb/></p>

			<head>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective<lb/></head>

			<figure>DEV/DOC(2011)14<lb/> 42<lb/> © OECD 2011<lb/></figure>

			<p>between the cost estimated and the progress expected is tenuous at best. Nevertheless, this<lb/> paper&apos;s estimates serve their limited purpose quite well: at a global level these calculations help<lb/> to provide a useful starting point for understanding the level of resources needed from both<lb/> domestic and external sources together to achieve the MDGs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cost estimates for achieving the MDGs through development service delivery appear<lb/> to be approximately on order of magnitude smaller than the estimates of the capital requirement<lb/> to achieve the growth needed to meet the MDGs. The service delivery calculations in section IV.2<lb/> lead to a global figure in the tens of USD billions, while the financing gap in Section IV.1 is<lb/> calculated to be on the order of hundreds of USD billions. Yet, this apparent difference in annual<lb/> amounts ignores the nature of the expenditures implied by the separate theoretical frameworks<lb/> underlying the two different sets of cost estimates; this is why this paper opts to utilise the<lb/> financing gap calculations for the low-income countries and to focus on the service delivery costs<lb/> for middle-income countries.<lb/> Indeed, the financing gap approach owes its intellectual heritage to the Harrod-Domar<lb/> growth models underpinning the &quot; take-off &quot; and &quot; big push &quot; literature of the 1950s and 1960s. The<lb/> stated aim of filling the gap in these models is to propel economies into a pattern of self-<lb/>sustaining growth in order to escape a poverty trap. As discussed in Sections II and III, aid may<lb/> not be the ideal means by which this gap is filled. However, beyond thinking about development<lb/> resources in terms of aid, these Harrod-Domar models – albeit simple – can be used to estimate<lb/> the rough size of the temporary capital requirement needed to increase growth and achieve<lb/> sufficiently high growth rates to help transform the structure of the economy into a self-<lb/>sustaining growth path.<lb/> In contrast, the development service approach is premised on the notion that public<lb/> expenditure is not vigorous enough to ensure that the poor stay out of poverty, that children are<lb/> enrolled in primary schools, and that child mortality, maternal mortality and pandemic diseases<lb/> are sufficiently kept in check. Taken at face value, this implies that the financing gap is<lb/> constructed as a time-bound target meant to raise domestic income high enough to ensure self-<lb/>sustaining MDG achievement, while the service delivery costs are conceived in a way that<lb/> requires the corresponding transfers to be maintained beyond the 2015 deadline to secure MDG<lb/> achievement. In other words, a drop in development service expenditure is expected to be<lb/> accompanied by a recurrence of poverty, declines in child enrolment, and resurgence of child<lb/> mortality, maternal mortality and deadly disease that compromise progress made on the MDGs.<lb/> The annual service delivery costs are naturally smaller than the annual financing gap in<lb/> both low-income and middle-income countries. However, it is important to compare the total<lb/> capital layout implied by the different theoretical frameworks that govern the separate cost<lb/> estimates. <ref type="table">Table 10</ref> compares the total capital cost of filling the financing gap in the lead up to<lb/> 2015 with the total capital cost of increasing service delivery expenditures into perpetuity. The<lb/> former is accomplished by simply summing the financing gap amounts over the six years<lb/> between 2009 – the base year used for the calculations – and 2015. The latter requires discounting<lb/> into perpetuity the recurring annual service delivery expenditure needed to achieve the MDGs<lb/> given the theoretical framework adopted for these calculations. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>, the total<lb/> capital layout needed to fill the financing gap in low-income countries, USD 372 billion, is a bit<lb/> more than half the net present value of recurring development service expenditure in these<lb/></p>

			<p>countries, USD 625 billion. In contrast, the discounted value of the recurring cash flows required<lb/> to achieve the MDGs through development service delivery in the middle-income countries,<lb/> USD 677 billion, is roughly half the financing gap in these countries, USD 1 308 billion. From this<lb/> point of view, filling the financing gap is actually less costly in low-income countries, while<lb/> achieving the MDGs through service delivery is less costly in middle-income countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The above results are also clearly linked to the discussion in Section IV.1: High<lb/> incremental capital-output ratios and high levels of inequality make poverty reduction through<lb/> investing in growth in most middle-income countries extremely costly, particularly in<lb/> comparison with the annual expenditures required to deliver MDG achievement through service<lb/> delivery. Moreover, as shown in Section IV.3, the scope for increasing domestic resource<lb/> mobilisation is also much higher, although perhaps not sufficiently enough, in middle-income<lb/> countries. Yet, if improved service delivery through increased resource mobilisation is the key to<lb/> MDG achievement in the middle-income countries, the question remains as to where should the<lb/> resources come from to fill the financing gap in low-income countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.5. Filling the &quot; financing gap &quot; in low-income countries without relying solely on<lb/> ODA<lb/></head>

			<p>The question of how to fill the financing gap in low-income countries is linked to the<lb/> reason why previous MDG cost estimates have focused on the argument to scale-up aid flows<lb/> over the past decade. In nominal dollar terms, the scaling-up of aid flows has been observed over<lb/> the last decade, with aid flows essentially doubling between the early 2000s and the end of the<lb/> decade. However, in real dollar terms and even more so as a share of Development Assistance<lb/> Committee (DAC) member country GDP, this scaling-up has been less sizeable. There is thus a<lb/> need to evaluate the implication that there should be a renewed focus on holding DAC member<lb/> governments to deliver on the commitments made in Monterrey, at Gleneagles and in Accra, and<lb/> most recently at Busan.<lb/> That DAC member governments make good on the substantial commitments that they<lb/> have made since the inception of the MDG framework is in fact a key criterion for reaching<lb/> MDG 8, the goal of building a global partnership of development. However, the budget<lb/></p>

			<head>Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective<lb/></head>

			<p>pressures on many DAC member governments are such that expecting ODA to remain constant<lb/> in nominal terms is probably already an optimistic scenario. Further, in the spirit of the Accra<lb/> Agenda for Action (2008) and its emphasis on ownership of development policies and on the<lb/> importance of domestic resource mobilisation, this paper&apos;s stated aim is to look beyond scaled-<lb/>up ODA as a prerequisite for MDG achievement. There is therefore a need to assess potential<lb/> sources of alternative development finance that can increase development investment in low-<lb/>income countries to the level of the financing gaps that characterise them.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also a need to re-examine the rationale behind the often cited goal of increasing<lb/> ODA flows to 0.7% of DAC member GDP. This target is often used as a measure of progress on<lb/> MDG 8. However, the call to scale-up aid flows to this 0.7% level predates the MDG framework.<lb/> Like the financing gap itself, this call has its origins in the simple Harrod-Domar model<lb/> employed by development economists in the 1960s. This 0.7% target actually stems from back-of-<lb/>the-envelope calculations performed by Jan Tinbergen and Hollis Chenery in the context of the<lb/> first &quot; development decade &quot; in the 1960s. Using a simple Harrod-Domar model, these economists<lb/> asserted that total capital flows to the developing world ought to be around 1% of the developed<lb/> world&apos;s GNI (<ref type="biblio">Clemens and Moss, 2005; Vandemoortele, 2011</ref>). At the time of their calculations,<lb/> private capital flows to developing countries constituted approximately 0.3% of the developed<lb/> countries&apos; GNI; therefore, they considered that the remaining 0.7% could be filled by public<lb/> flows. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows that during the 1970s, again during the late 1990s, and again during the<lb/> mid-2000s, private capital flows from DAC members to partners were substantially higher than<lb/> this 0.3% and in fact exceeded the share of DAC member output that was transferred to<lb/> development partners through concessionary flows.<lb/></p>

Nonetheless, the<lb/> order of magnitude and the trend of these private capital flows is such that the prospect of filling<lb/> the financing gap in low-income countries at least partly through increased private capital flows<lb/> is a real option. The high volatility of these flows needs to be addressed, however. If these<lb/> private capital flows were to constitute a large share of development finance, their volatility<lb/> would have to be properly managed so that it does not exacerbate macroeconomic instability in<lb/> developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>If private capital flows are to play a larger role in financing human development<lb/> outcomes, governments must do more to encourage such flows and manage their volatility.<lb/> Private flows are attracted by economic returns and are therefore sensitive to economic policies<lb/> in the recipient countries as well as external conditions, such as commodity prices. These factors<lb/> are not all within the control of the recipient countries. Given a shift in the composition of capital<lb/> flows towards emerging partners, there is also a shift in the kinds of projects being financed. For<lb/> instance, traditional donors tend to fund social infrastructure projects such as water and roads,<lb/> which are of particular relevance for MDGs. In contrast, the 2011 edition of the African Economic<lb/> Outlook has documented that emerging partners tend to focus on production oriented<lb/> infrastructure such as power generation and railways.

			<head>V. CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>The scale of financing needed to achieve the MDGs is affordable at the global level,<lb/> particularly if countries adopt a broad view of the types of resources that can help improve<lb/> human development outcomes in countries that are falling behind on MDG progress. Official<lb/> Development Assistance remains an important source for financing MDG achievement,<lb/> particularly in low-income countries. DAC member countries therefore need to deliver on their<lb/> outstanding commitments, particularly with respect to making aid more effective, so that it can<lb/> help catalyse development success. Domestic resource mobilisation via increased tax revenues is<lb/> the most sustainable and dependable source of funding towards MDG achievement, particularly<lb/> in middle-income countries. Developing countries are making notable efforts to improve tax<lb/> collection. They can achieve further progress in broadening their tax base, particularly in the<lb/> taxation of resource rents, which have grown dramatically over the last decade. Private capital<lb/> flows also represent a sizeable, and largely untapped, resource for MDG financing. More can be<lb/> done to ensure that these flows are fully exploited to promoted MDG achievement, whether they<lb/> come from traditional DAC members or from emerging partner countries.<lb/> The purpose of this paper is to revisit the costing estimates that have shaped much of the<lb/> discourse on the MDGs over the past decade. A fresh perspective on countries&apos; capacity to raise<lb/> additional development investment on their own is needed. The orders of magnitude of<lb/> resources needed to achieve the MDGs in the developing world as a whole are compatible with<lb/> the degree of financial resources available, both domestic and external. While this paper offers a<lb/> specific figure for how much achieving the MDGs could cost, the aim is not to propose that<lb/> development partners necessarily scramble to raise the corresponding amount of ODA. Rather,<lb/> these estimates should be used for understanding the size of the problem that continues to face<lb/> many countries, and indeed the world. Although it is not an insurmountably high amount, it is<lb/> of an order of magnitude larger than the size of resources that can be raised from development<lb/> co-operation alone, especially in current circumstances.<lb/> The USD 120 billion of additional annual resources estimated to be needed to achieve the<lb/> MDGs is divided between a USD 62.1 billion &quot; financing gap &quot; in 20 low-income countries and<lb/> USD 59.2 billion of expenditure on the provision of development services in 79 other low-and<lb/> middle-income countries. Some USD 64 billion in additional tax revenues could be raised<lb/> through tax collection, primarily in middle-income countries. Unfortunately, however, the bulk<lb/> of these additional resources would be raised in countries that are already on track for achieving<lb/> the MDGs.

Complementary sources of funding include<lb/> emerging countries that have experienced success in scaling-up their own resources. A renewed<lb/> and more systematic attempt to put private capital flows to work in the service of development<lb/> in low-income countries is another complementary option.<lb/></table>

			<p>However, even with full financing of all the MDG cost, the MDGs will not necessarily be<lb/> achieved. As pointed out in this paper, financing health and education expenditures is not<lb/> identical to ensuring health and education outcomes. They require good policies in the form of<lb/> strong public expenditure management at all levels of government, good implementation<lb/> capacity, and a medium-term fiscal policy that would ensure the sustainability of the MDGs.<lb/> While the availability of financing is clearly important, it is no panacea for realising the MDGs.<lb/> This paper aims to appraise the limits to the costing frameworks that the development<lb/> community can employ to gauge the scale of resources needed globally to achieve development<lb/> goals. Like the wise men in the ancient parable, development economists who construct and use<lb/> these global costing estimates must be cautious not to focus too much attention on what the<lb/> individual estimates might imply for policy, but rather how the size of the estimates as a whole<lb/> compares to the size of other resources available, beyond Official Development Assistance. MDG<lb/> achievement corresponds to a large, but manageable cost for the world as a whole. However,<lb/> expecting that this cost should be provided by official development assistance alone is akin to<lb/> assuming that the elephant has a snake for its nose, rather than a trunk.<lb/></p>

			<p>As we approach the 2015 deadline of the MDGs, it is important to reflect that the time-<lb/>bound nature of the goals has helped galvanize global dialogue and action about development<lb/> challenges. At the end of the day, however, concrete progress can only take the form of<lb/> individual country-specific interventions. These interventions are something to which all global<lb/> citizens, not just development agencies and concessional lenders, can contribute. Looking<lb/> beyond 2015, it is important that this broader vision of development co-operation be maintained<lb/> and to inform how the process of global target setting is undertaken and how the corresponding<lb/> achievement is attained.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ANNEX 1: CALCULATING THE FINANCING GAP<lb/> The methods used by Devarajan et al. (2002) are adapted to calculate the financing gap,<lb/> i.e. to estimate the additional resources needed to increase growth and thereby reduce income or<lb/> consumption poverty headcount ratios by one-half of their 1990 levels in each country.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A simple Harrod-Domar model defines the per capita growth rate, y, as a function of the<lb/> savings rate, s, the incremental capital-output ratio, θ, and the population growth rate, p:<lb/></p>

				<formula>í µí±¦ =<lb/> í µí±<lb/> í µí¼<lb/> − í µí±<lb/></formula>

			<p>Saving (as a share of total output Y) is assumed to be entirely invested domestically and is<lb/> augmented with foreign investment inflows, FDI, and aid inflows, ODA, plus any other<lb/> additional resources (either external or domestic in origin). Thus, the above equation becomes:<lb/></p>

			<figure>í µí±¦ =<lb/> (í µí± í µí± + í µí±í µí°·í µí°´+µí°´+ í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼ + í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± )<lb/> í µí±<lb/> *<lb/> 1<lb/> í µí¼<lb/> − í µí±<lb/></figure>

			<p>Next, the savings rate, output, foreign investment inflows, aid, population growth and<lb/> the incremental capital output ratio are taken as given. Thus, it is possible to calculate as a<lb/> function of these variables the amount of additional resources and the incremental capital-output<lb/> ratio--estimates for each country over a long period, as described below--needed to achieve a<lb/> target growth rate:<lb/> í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± = (í µí±¦ + í µí±) * í µí± * í µí¼ − í µí± í µí± + í µí±í µí°·í µí°´+µí°´+ í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼<lb/></p>

			<p>The target growth rate is determined by the growth in consumption or income needed to<lb/> achieve the mean consumption or income that gives a poverty headcount half of 1990 levels<lb/> given the most recent Lorenz curve parameters, as spelled out in Section III:<lb/></p>

As shown by Datt (1998), any<lb/> level of consumption or income per capita can be shown to be associated with a given poverty<lb/> headcount, H, Lorenz curve parameters, π, and a poverty line, z. The parameters of the Lorenz<lb/> curve are estimated for each country using PovcalNet&apos;s data on each decile&apos;s share of income or<lb/> consumption available for 117 countries from the PovcalNet online database. For most countries,<lb/> this database uses distributional data from surveys conducted during the mid to late 2000s. Two<lb/> parameterisations of the Lorenz curve are tried, and the valid curve with the best fit is used.<lb/> Then, the target mean consumption or income level, μ2015 target, is derived as a function of the<lb/> estimated Lorenz curve parameters, πlatest, the headcount ratio and the poverty line, zUSD 1.25 / day<lb/> (that is, USD 38 PPP per month), following Datt (1998):<lb/></p>

Total investment in constant<lb/> local currency units as provided by the IMF World Economic Outlook database is summed over<lb/> the period 1990-2015 and then divided by the difference between projected real GDP in 2016 less<lb/> real GDP in the first available year over the 1990-2015 period:<lb/> í µí¼ =<lb/> ∑<lb/> í µí°¼ í µí±¡<lb/> 2015<lb/> í µí±¡=1990<lb/> í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± 2016 − í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± 1990<lb/></figure>
