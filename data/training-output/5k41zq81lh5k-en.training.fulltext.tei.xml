			<head>I. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The severity of the Great Recession on young people&apos;s labour market status has been well<lb/> documented, particularly in the most affected countries. Ireland was severely hit, as illustrated by the<lb/> contraction of Gross National Product (GNP) by almost 10% in 2009 (<ref type="biblio">Duffy et al., 2011</ref>). The economy<lb/> temporarily resumed modest growth in 2010, before experiencing another contraction in 2011<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Duffy et al., 2013</ref>). This collapse in economic activity resulted in the country&apos;s unemployment rate<lb/> increasing from 4.4% in</p>

			<table>2006 to 14.7% in 2012 (Central Statistics Office, 2012a and 2013a), while the<lb/> youth unemployment rate increased from 8.7% in 2006 to 30.6 % in 2012 (Eurostat, 2013)<lb/> 2 . Two<lb/> developments raise particular concerns in relation to young unemployed people: the growth in the numbers<lb/> with no formal education, which rose from 17.4% of unemployed people aged 15-24 in 2007 to 48.9% in<lb/> 2011 (Eurostat, 2012)<lb/> 3 ; and the percentage who are in long-term unemployment, which increased from<lb/> 20.3% in 2007 to 45.8% in 2011 (OECD, 2013) 4 . Another worry is the rise in young people not in<lb/> employment, education or training (NEET), which has grown from 11.8 % in 2006 to 24% in 2011<lb/> (Eurostat, 2013) 5 .<lb/></table>

			<p>While policy-makers are aware of the unemployment rate of young people, little is known about this<lb/> group&apos;s profile or the extent to which it has changed since the beginning of the recession. Gaps in<lb/> knowledge also exist in relation to their labour market transitions (i.e. movement from unemployment to<lb/> employment or inactivity, or remaining unemployed), both pre and post the great recession. Given this, and<lb/> particularly its importance in the design of effective activation measures to assist young unemployed<lb/> people, this paper addresses the following questions:<lb/> 1. Has the profile of unemployed youths changed during the course of the recession?<lb/> 2. What are the labour market transition patterns of young unemployed individuals&apos; pre and post the<lb/> boom?<lb/></p>

			<p>3. To what extent do changes in the composition of the youth unemployment stock explain changes<lb/> in youth labour market transition rates over time?<lb/> 4. To what extent do changes in the labour market value of various characteristics explain changes<lb/> in youth labour market transition rates over time?<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper uses newly available longitudinal data from the Quarterly National Household Survey<lb/> (QNHS), Ireland&apos;s Labour Force Survey, to address these questions. The remainder of the paper is<lb/> structured as follows. Section II presents a brief overview of the Irish labour market. The literature on<lb/> young unemployed individuals is discussed in Section III, while the data and methodologies that are<lb/> employed in the paper are described in Section IV. Finally, the results from the analyses and the central<lb/> conclusions are presented in Sections V and VI.<lb/></p>

			<head>II. The Labour Market for Young People in Ireland<lb/></head>

			<p>The Great Recession led to a dramatic deterioration in the labour market. Total employment fell by<lb/> 250 000 between the peak of Quarter 3 (Q3) 2007 and the end of 2009, a contraction of 11.5%.<lb/> Employment continued to fall, by another 100 000 from the end of 2009 to the beginning of 2012,<lb/> representing a cumulative decline in employment of 16% from the peak of the boom<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Central Statistics Office, 2013b</ref>). Subsequent employment growth has been extremely sluggish: total<lb/> employment increased by about 20 000, or 1.4% over the 12 months to the start of 2013. Unemployment<lb/> more than trebled, from 107 500 in Q3 2007 to over 328 000 in Q3 2012, and the unemployment rate<lb/> increased from 4.6% to more than 15% over that period. Since then, the unemployment rate has declined<lb/> somewhat, to 13.7% at the beginning of 2013, partly reflecting increasing part-time working, falling<lb/> participation and increased emigration.<lb/></p>

			<p>The deterioration in the labour market for young people has been particularly severe. Total<lb/> employment among those aged less than 25 years collapsed in the recession, falling by over 50%, from<lb/> 357 000 in Q3 2007 to 172 000 in Q3 2011. Following the well-documented burst of the Irish property<lb/> bubble, employment losses were concentrated in the construction and related sectors, but there were<lb/> notable declines across the whole private sector. Young people did not participate even in the modest<lb/> growth in overall employment in the most recent period, with the result that at the beginning of 2013 total<lb/> employment among those aged less than 25 years had fallen to 148 000, representing a cumulative decline<lb/> in employment of almost 60% since the peak of the boom. Given this contraction in young people&apos;s<lb/> employment, the employment rate shrank from just under 45% in 2007 to 27% in 2013 (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The<lb/> unemployment rate increased from 9% of the youth labour force in 2007 to almost 30% in Q3 2011, and<lb/> then, driven by a fall in participation, fell back to 26% in Q1 2013. It should be noted that notwithstanding<lb/> these high rates of unemployment, youth unemployment generally accounts for a relatively modest share<lb/> of total unemployment: in 2013, youth unemployment accounted for 18% of total unemployment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The youth unemployment rate in Ireland is far higher than the average youth unemployment rate in<lb/> Europe: 23% at the start of 2013. However, care should be taken in interpreting unemployment among<lb/> young people, given that young people may choose to remain in education rather than entering the labour<lb/> market when it is in recession. The importance of this in the Irish case can be seen by focusing on the<lb/> labour force participation rate, which has fallen steadily, from a high of 59% in 2007 to just 37% in 2013.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Conefrey (2011)</ref> examines the fall in participation among the younger age groups following the recession<lb/> in 2008 and finds that the majority of those who exited the labour force and remain in Ireland have<lb/> returned to education. Participation has also been affected by increasing outward migration, which has<lb/> been concentrated among the youngest cohorts (<ref type="biblio">Conefrey, 2013</ref>). An alternative, and perhaps more<lb/> appropriate, measure of unemployment among young people is the unemployment ratio, which expresses<lb/> unemployment as a ratio of the total population cohort, rather than the number in the labour force, as is<lb/> used in the unemployment rate. The unemployment ratio increased sharply from 5% in 2007 to almost 13%<lb/> in 2011, and subsequently fell to just under 10% of the age cohort in 2013.<lb/></p>

			<p>Within the youth cohort, there is considerable variation in labour market behaviour by age and gender.<lb/> In general, younger people, aged 15-19 have much lower participation and employment rates than those<lb/> aged 20-24, and while the younger cohort shows higher unemployment rates, they have lower<lb/> unemployment ratios. Thus, for example, the unemployment rate among males aged 15-19 years is over<lb/> 46%, but this relates to the 16% of this age group that participates in the labour market, with the result that<lb/> the unemployment ratio for males aged 15-19 is just over 7% of the age group. Females have higher<lb/> employment rates and lower unemployment rates and ratios than males in the corresponding age groups<lb/> 6 .<lb/> 6.<lb/> In this more detailed discussion of the youth labour market we mainly focus on data relating to Q2 2011, the<lb/> start point for the panel data relating to the recession that is used in the analysis that follows.<lb/></p>

			<p>Just over 29 000 individuals in the 15-24 year age group had been unemployed for 12 months or more<lb/> in Q2 2011. This represented 40% of the total unemployed in this age group, a substantially lower<lb/> incidence of long-term unemployment than observed among older age groups – for example almost 60% of<lb/> the unemployed aged 25-44 were long term unemployed, as were 65% of those aged 45 years or older. The<lb/> lower incidence of long-term among young people relative to those among older cohorts may be due to<lb/> higher rates of labour force withdrawal following a period of unemployment. Among young people, labour<lb/> force withdrawal can entail returns to education as well as emigration, which is known to be higher among<lb/> younger people (Central Statistics Office, 2012b). The share of long-term in total unemployment is<lb/> generally higher among males, and this is also true for males aged 15-24.<lb/></p>

			<head>III. Literature Review<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a consensus emerging in the nascent literature on the effect of recessions on labour market<lb/> dynamics, that the great 2008-2009 recession has had particularly strong effects. Most of the studies focus<lb/> on the overall population as opposed to youths per se. An examination of US data up to 2009 revealed that<lb/> the unemployment to employment transition rate fell proportionately more in the great recession than in<lb/> previous recessions (<ref type="biblio">Aaronson et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The transition rate in the great recession appears to have been affected by the exceptional weakness of<lb/> aggregate demand as well as changing composition of the unemployed (<ref type="biblio">Valletta and Kuang, 2012</ref>).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Bachman et al., (2012)</ref> utilised a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to isolate the differences in US labour<lb/> market transition rates during the great recession into a part that is attributable to changes in the<lb/> composition of the underlying population, and a part that is due to changes in the returns to population<lb/> characteristics. They found composition effects change over the course of the recession, initially<lb/> contributing positively to a higher transition to employment, but gradually fading and turning negative over<lb/> the course of the contraction. According to <ref type="biblio">Bachman et al., (2012)</ref>, this is because at the beginning of the<lb/> recession the unemployment stock contained many more well-qualified and experienced individuals who<lb/> had been recently fired and who got re-employed quickly. However, as the recession continued the share of<lb/> less capable unemployed increased, which had a negative impact on the overall transition to employment.<lb/> Compositional changes also accounted partly for the sharp rise in duration of unemployment that<lb/> accompanied the great recession. One such factor in the United States over the past three decades is a<lb/> decline in the share in the labour force of youth, who tend to have shorter unemployment durations as they<lb/> frequently move in an out of the labour force (<ref type="biblio">Valletta and Kuang, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2013)76<lb/></figure>

			<p>By contrast policy change appears to have played less of a role. <ref type="biblio">Farber et al., (2013)</ref> concluded that<lb/> the decline in the transition from unemployment to employment in the recent US recession was not due to<lb/> an extension in unemployment benefits. Instead, the small and statistically significant reduction in the<lb/> unemployment exit rate over the recent recession occurred primarily through a reduction in exits from the<lb/> labour force, rather than to a decrease in exits to employment.<lb/> Education plays a strong role in labour market status and transitions over the business cycle, although<lb/> this effect can vary across countries and the phase of the cycle. Prior to the crisis, the employment rate of<lb/> low-educated youths was higher in Spain than in Germany, France, United Kingdom and Netherlands, and<lb/> the opposite was found for youths with intermediate and higher levels of education (<ref type="biblio">Dolado et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> The probabilities of being unemployed and discouraged (i.e. not searching for work) increased the most<lb/> during the crisis for poorly educated individuals in South Africa (<ref type="biblio">Verick, 2012</ref>). It also appears that<lb/> education had more influence on labour-market outcomes as the recent recession progressed. Analysis of<lb/> data for the United Kingdom shows that the substantial differences in the employment, unemployment and<lb/> inactivity rates, and transition probabilities, across different education levels were exacerbated by the<lb/> recession, particularly for lower education levels (<ref type="biblio">Gomes, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In addition to education, employment history also plays a role in transitions, which varies across<lb/> countries. A greater history of temporary jobs decreased the probability of studying in Spain, while the<lb/> opposite was found for the Netherlands (<ref type="biblio">Dolado et al., 2013</ref>). For woman, in addition to human capital<lb/> factors, such as education and previous work experience, young children also influence (negatively) their<lb/> mothers&apos; transition probabilities from non-employment to employment (Russell and O&apos;<ref type="biblio">Connell, 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also evidence at the overall labour force level that immigration status has a bearing on overall<lb/> labour market dynamics, including during the great recession. Total employment losses among non-Irish<lb/> nationals were four times higher than for Irish nationals (<ref type="biblio">McGinnity et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Veenman (2011)<lb/></ref> documents that in the Netherlands native Dutch individuals leave unemployment the fastest, and among the<lb/> non-native individuals Turks exit unemployment most slowly. In contrast to these findings, immigrant<lb/> status had no statistically significant effect on the probability of working in Spain (<ref type="biblio">Dolado et al., 2013</ref>). In<lb/> spite of this research, little is known about the role of immigration status for youths and how it may have<lb/> changed pre-and post the recent economic crisis.<lb/> Regarding youth, it is well known that young people tend to be particularly hard hit by recessions.<lb/> Several papers have looked at the impact of economic downturns on youth&apos;s labour market status, but most<lb/> of the work focuses on the effects of recessions on their unemployment levels rather than on their labour<lb/> market transitions. A review of the effects on unemployment by age cohort of previous financial crises in<lb/> Finland, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Turkey found that youths are worst effected; and the<lb/> unemployment gap with respect to adults remains even after the economy has begun to recover<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Verick, 2011</ref>). Indeed, financial crises have protracted effects on youth unemployment and may affect<lb/> youths five years after the onset of the crisis (<ref type="biblio">Choudry et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> Previous research on labour market transitions among young people using German and United<lb/> Kingdom data prior to the great recession found that recent unemployment history and education played an<lb/> important role in youth transitions (<ref type="biblio">Isengard, 2003</ref>). However, as for the general population, an analysis of<lb/> nine European countries found that the impact of education on employment probabilities for youth differed<lb/> significant across countries (<ref type="biblio">Russell and O&apos;Connell, 2001</ref>).<lb/> For Irish youth, work experience enhances the possibility of finding a job (O&apos;<ref type="biblio">Connell and<lb/> McGinnity, 1997</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Kelly et al., (2012)</ref>, using Irish data, find that a recent history of long-term<lb/> unemployment, advanced age, number of children, relatively low levels of education, and<lb/> literacy/numeracy problems all reduced young unemployed individuals&apos; probability of moving into<lb/> employment.<lb/> How the great recession may have altered the importance of various characteristics in determining<lb/> youths&apos; labour market outcomes remains relatively unexplored. This paper attempts to, inter alia, partially<lb/> fill this gap in the literature by examining how labour market transitions for unemployed youth in Ireland,<lb/> one of the hardest hit economies in the OECD during the global financial crisis, have changed pre-crisis<lb/> (2006) and as the economy emerged from the recent recession (2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. Data and Methodology<lb/></head>

			<p>Analysing the impact of the recession on the situation of youths in the labour market can be enhanced<lb/> by the availability of longitudinal data, as such data enables researchers to analyse the movements of<lb/> individuals in and out of unemployment, employment and inactivity. A good understanding of these<lb/> movements, so-called labour market transitions, can be helpful in designing effective labour market<lb/> policies to assist unemployed youths to reintegrate back into the labour market. Longitudinal data allows<lb/> researchers to assess associations between various characteristics, such as age or educational attainment,<lb/> and transitions between different labour market states. By following individuals over time, longitudinal<lb/> data analysis also enables researchers to assess how labour market transitions, or the associations with<lb/> different characteristics, may change pre and post an economic crisis.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data used in this paper come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) longitudinal<lb/> data file. The longitudinal component of the QNHS is a relatively new dataset that has been made available<lb/> by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which is Ireland&apos;s national statistical collection organisation. The<lb/> main objective of the QNHS is to provide quarterly labour force estimates on employment, unemployment,<lb/> etc. The survey is continuous and targets all private households in the State. The total sample for each<lb/> quarter is approximately 39 000, which is achieved by interviewing about 3 000 households per week.<lb/> Households are asked to take part in the survey for five consecutive quarters. In each quarter, one-fifth of<lb/> the households surveyed are replaced and the QNHS sample involves an overlap of 80% between<lb/> consecutive quarters and 20% between the same quarters in consecutive years. While participation in the<lb/> QNHS is voluntary, the response rate is quite high (approximately 85% in recent years).<lb/></p>

			<head>7<lb/></head>

			<p>The benefit of using the QNHS longitudinal data is that it enabled us to follow the labour market<lb/> transitions of individuals for up to 5 consecutive quarters. In terms of the periods covered in our study, we<lb/> focused on comparing the youth unemployment situation both pre and post recession. We selected<lb/> Quarter 2 (Q2) 2006 as the starting point for our pre-recession analysis, which was during the height of the<lb/> boom in Ireland; and Q2 2011 as our start point for the analysis relating to the Recession. For the purposes<lb/> of the paper, we selected two balanced panels. Specifically, we focus on young individuals (defined as<lb/> aged 15 to 24) who were unemployed on entering the panel and who remained in the panel for the next two<lb/> consecutive quarters: we were unable to take advantage of the full panel information (i.e. use the five<lb/> quarters of data) due to the small number of young people who remained both unemployed and present in<lb/> the data for five continuous quarters during the boom period (e.g. 2006). Thus, we are focusing on the<lb/> transition patterns of young unemployed people between Q2 and Q4 in</p>

			<table>2006 and 2011 respectively,<lb/> focusing particularly on their transitions from unemployment into employment. Given this, our<lb/> unemployed youth sample is 5 926 for 2006 and 13 933 for 2011<lb/> 8 . In order to accommodate our empirical<lb/> 7.<lb/> Information provided by the CSO.<lb/> 8.<lb/> We excluded those who transitioned into economic inactivity from the analysis, and also those individuals that<lb/> did not provide information on their education.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)76<lb/> strategy, we transform our balanced panel into a cross-sectional dataset based on the characteristics of<lb/> individuals observed in Q2 2006 and Q2 2011 respectively and incorporate their transition behaviours in<lb/> Q3 and Q4 for each of the observed years. Given that we only consider individuals who remain present in<lb/> Ireland over the observation periods, those who migrated to or from Ireland during the period covered by<lb/> each panel are excluded from the analysis.<lb/></table>

			<p>In this paper, we begin by assessing the impact of various socio-economic and demographic factors<lb/> on an unemployed youth&apos;s likelihood of transitioning to employment. This analysis is undertaken by<lb/> estimating separate binary probit models for 2006 and 2011, where the dependent variable equals one if an<lb/> unemployed youth transitioned to employment during the observation period and zero otherwise. The<lb/> characteristics investigated are as follows: gender, age, nationality, educational attainment, geographic<lb/> location and previous unemployment duration 9 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to examining the impact of various socio-economic characteristics on an unemployed<lb/> youth&apos;s likelihood of transitioning to employment, we are also interested in investigating what has driven<lb/> the change in the unemployment-to-</p>

			<figure>employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011. This analysis was<lb/> undertaken using decomposition techniques. With this approach, we split out the change in the<lb/> unemployment to employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011 into the proportion due to i) changes<lb/> in the composition of the youth unemployed population (e.g. if there are more unemployed youths with<lb/> higher levels of schooling), which is known as the &apos;Endowment Effect&apos;; ii) changes in the labour market<lb/> returns to possessing certain characteristics over time (e.g. changes in the marginal impact of<lb/> characteristics on the probability of a transition to employment in 2011 relative to 2006), which is known<lb/> as the &apos;Coefficient Effect&apos;; and iii) an unexplained effect, which is due to unobserved factors that are not<lb/> observed in the QNHS longitudinal data. Given that our dependent variable is a dichotomous 0/1 variable,<lb/> we estimated non-linear decomposition models: i) the Fairlie model, which produces an overall<lb/> endowment effect, ii) the Non-linear decompose model<lb/> 10 , which gives overall endowment and coefficient<lb/> effects, and iii) the Oaxaca decomposition, which produces overall endowment and coefficient effects and<lb/> also a breakdown for each individual variable.<lb/></figure>

Results<lb/> Descriptives<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>			<figure>presents the profile of youths who were unemployed in Q2 2006 and 2011 according to their<lb/> subsequent labour market status, i.e. remained continuously unemployed between Q2 2006 (2011) and Q4<lb/> 2006 (2011) or transitioned into employment.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Focussing first on the characteristics of those that remained continuously unemployed, there was a<lb/> considerable drop in the proportion of such youths aged 15 to 19 between 2006 and 2011, falling from 46%<lb/> to 19%, while the proportion aged 20 to 24 increased. The fall in the younger age category may be due to<lb/> such individuals choosing to remain outside of the labour market in 2011 as a result of the recession,<lb/> remaining on in education instead. The proportion of continuously unemployed that was male increased<lb/> slightly in 2011, while there was a fall in the proportion that was Irish. In relation to educational<lb/> attainment, there was a substantial drop in the proportion that had a Junior Certificate or less qualification<lb/> 9.<lb/> The QNHS contains information on a person&apos;s previous economic sector of employment; however, we were<lb/> not able to include this variable in our specifications as a significant proportion of young people did not<lb/> provide this information, and for those that did, there was not enough variation in the data to</p>

			<p>in<lb/> the geographical distribution of continuously unemployed youths over the period. Finally, in terms of<lb/> previous unemployment duration, there was a sizeable fall in the proportion that had experienced 1 to<lb/> 3 months of unemployment in the past, whereas there was an increase in the numbers with 13 months or<lb/> more previous unemployment duration over the period.<lb/></p>

			<p>In relation to the characteristics of those that transitioned from unemployment to employment, there<lb/> was a fall in the proportion that was male between 2006 and 2011. The proportion that was Irish increased<lb/> also. In terms of educational attainment, there was a fall in the proportion that had a Junior Certificate or<lb/> Leave Certificate qualification, while there was a considerable increase in the percentage with a<lb/> Third-level Degree or Higher qualification over the period. With respect to previous unemployment<lb/> duration, there was a sizeable increase by 2011 in the proportion of individuals who made the transition<lb/> from unemployment to employment who had already experienced 13 months or more unemployment<lb/> duration at the start of the panel, while the percentages making a successful employment transition that had<lb/> experienced 1 to 3 months or 7 to 12 months of previous unemployment fell. This suggests that successful<lb/> employment transitions were more evenly distributed across unemployment durations in the later period,<lb/> which suggests that the long-term unemployed during the boom period were distinctive and/or particularly<lb/> disadvantaged in terms of labour market prospects. Finally, some changes in the shares entering<lb/> employment by geographical region were also apparent between 2006 and 2011.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the transition rates for unemployed youths in both 2006 and 2011. In 2006, 38% of<lb/> unemployed youths transitioned into employment; however, only 17% made this labour market transition<lb/> in 2011. As one might expect, the proportion of youths that remained continuously unemployed increased<lb/> between 2006 and 2011, from 37% to 52%, and there was an increase in the numbers entering into<lb/> economic inactivity. Overall labour force participation rates among those aged 15-24 declined from 55% in<lb/> 2006 to 42% in 2011. While the change in the magnitude and nature of transitions to inactivity before and<lb/> during the recession is an important issue for policy, the issue is not addressed in the current study as it is<lb/> likely that the dynamics of change are likely to be quite distinct relative to unemployment and employment<lb/> transitions and, as such, warrant a dedicated analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results from our probit models on the determinants of transitioning from unemployment to<lb/> employment in 2006 and 2011 are presented in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. During both the boom and recessionary periods in<lb/> Ireland, we can see that unemployed males were significantly less likely than females to enter employment.<lb/> Interestingly, while during the Celtic Tiger era unemployed youths aged 20 to 24 were more likely to find a<lb/> job compared to those aged 15 to 19, the opposite result was the case during the recession in 2011. We also<lb/> see that the nationality result has changed with Irish nationals more likely to enter employment in 2011<lb/> relative to 2006. Apart from Third-level Non-Degree holders, all educational qualifications raised the<lb/> likelihood of transitioning into employment during 2006 compared to those with a Junior Certificate<lb/> qualification or less. The finding that the third-level non-degree holders had a lower probability of<lb/> transitioning to employment in 2006 relative to youths with compulsory education or less is potentially<lb/> explained by two factors: (a) a very high level of demand for unskilled workers due to high demand within<lb/> construction and service industries; and (b) a poor alignment with subject provision in this area with the<lb/> needs of the labour market at that time. The largest educational coefficient during the earlier time period<lb/> was associated with having a Post-Leaving Cert (PLC) level qualification, which predominately related to<lb/> either a vocational education or apprenticeship training in the retail, catering/hospitality and construction<lb/> sectors. However, in 2011 there is no statistical difference in the impact of a Junior Certificate or less<lb/> qualification and a PLC level qualification on transitioning from unemployment into employment, with<lb/> both educational categories having a lower impact on employment transitions compared to the other<lb/> educational groups. With respect to relative marginal effects, the magnitude of the Leaving Certificate<lb/> coefficient has fallen over time; whereas there has been a large increase in the Third-level Degree or<lb/> Higher coefficient. Unlike the 2006 situation where the impact was negative, possessing a Third-level<lb/> Non-Degree qualification increases the probability of a successful labour-market transition relative to the<lb/> base education category, driven presumably by a rapid fall in the relative demand for unskilled labour<lb/> relative to the earlier period. Some changes are also observed in relation to geographic location. Finally, in<lb/> relation to previous unemployment duration, all categories above 1-3 months are significantly less likely to<lb/> move from unemployment to employment during both the boom and recession periods; the size of the<lb/> effects for 7-12 months has increased over time while it has fallen for the other duration categories.<lb/> Moving on to our decomposition analysis, the overall decomposition results from the three non-linear<lb/> models that we estimated are shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. Reassuringly, each of the decomposition models produced<lb/> almost identical results. The &apos;Overall Difference&apos; result tells us that the transition rate from unemployment<lb/> to employment fell by 25 percentage points between 2006 and 2011. Of this, changes in the structure of the<lb/> youth unemployed population (i.e. the endowment effect) between 2006 and 2011 can only explain<lb/> 2.5 percentage points of the fall in the transition rate, while changes in the returns to possessing the<lb/> characteristics that we have included in our model (i.e. the coefficient effect) explains a bigger proportion<lb/> of the fall in the transition rate. However, unobservable factors that we have not included in our<lb/> specification (e.g. labour market experience, socio-economic background, etc.), because such information<lb/> is not available in the QNHS longitudinal data, account for almost half of the fall in the transition rate.<lb/></p>

On the one hand, we can see from this table that relative to possessing a Junior<lb/> Certificate qualification, having either a Leaving Certificate or PLC level qualification had a depreciating<lb/> effect on the unemployment-to-employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011. Having previous<lb/> unemployment duration of 7 to 12 months, relative to those with previous unemployment duration of 1 to<lb/> 3 months, also had a depreciating effect on the transition rate. On the other hand, possessing a third-level<lb/> qualification (Non-Degree or Degree or Higher) had an appreciating effecting on the unemployment to<lb/> employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011, as did being Irish, aged 15 to 19 and having a previous<lb/> unemployment duration of 13 months and above<lb/> 12 . Overall, our results indicate that the relative fall in the<lb/> unemployment to employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011 is not due to changes in the<lb/> population structure of unemployed young people, but to changes in external factors that have had an<lb/> impact on possessing certain characteristics. These are likely to reflect the impact of the recession.<lb/></figure>

			<p>12.<lb/> An important policy change took place over the period whereby the entitlement to contributions related<lb/> assistance (Jobseekers benefit (JB)) was reduced from 15 to 12 months. However, given that individuals in the<lb/> 15 to 19 age bracket who became unemployed in 2006 were unlikely to have made sufficient contributions to<lb/> entitle them to JSB for an extended period, we do not believe that the policy switch will have a strong impact<lb/> in explaining the observed result.<lb/></p>

			<head>VI. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>Using a unique longitudinal dataset, this paper examined the extent to which transitions to<lb/> employment among unemployed youths in Ireland changed over the great recession. The study found that<lb/> the rate of transition to employment for unemployed youths fell dramatically between 2006 and 2011.<lb/> Overall, the results showed that the fall in unemployed youth&apos;s transition rate was not due to changes in<lb/> composition, or the characteristics of the unemployed group but to changes in the external environment<lb/> that meant that the impact of certain characteristics changed over the course of the recession. For example,<lb/> it was found that the there was a rise in the marginal impact of education and Irish nationality on the<lb/> probability of a successful transition from unemployment to employment. This finding is consistent with<lb/> an emerging international pattern in which the importance of education to labour market outcomes has<lb/> increased in the course of the recession. There was also a change in the impact of age, with younger<lb/> workers having now better prospects than young adults. Youth possessing higher educational levels face<lb/> better prospects of moving into employment, and certain qualifications (for example PLC level<lb/> qualification), which enhanced employability in 2006, did no longer have a positive effect in 2011.<lb/> Previous unemployment spells continued to have a detrimental impact on the likelihood of moving into<lb/> employment for all unemployment durations. Those unemployed for 7-12 months faced more difficulties<lb/> in accessing employment after the recession. Periods of unemployment shorter than 6 months and longer<lb/> than 13 months continued to have a negative impact, although the impact was found to be smaller in 2011<lb/> than in 2006. However, caution should be used in interpreting the smaller negative impact on the length of<lb/> unemployment. In particular, labour market conditions remained difficult in 2011, with aggregate<lb/> employment continuing to fall. In these circumstances, it is difficult for anyone (short or long-term<lb/> unemployed) to find a job, likely masking scarring effects. As the economy picks up and more jobs are<lb/> created, the scarring effect may become more obvious as there will be vacancies for the newly unemployed<lb/> to apply to and out-compete the long-term unemployed.</p>
