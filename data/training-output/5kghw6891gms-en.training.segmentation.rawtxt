main focus is on the differences in the status and area of employment expected by girls and boys in high 
school. In almost all countries, girls lead boys in their interest in non-manual, high status professional 
occupations. This can be seen as a vertical dimension of gender segregation in occupational preferences. 
Students also differ by gender in selecting particular fields of employment within status categories. These 
differences make up the horizontal segregation of students' expectations and, in PISA 2006, are prominent 
in the gendered choices of specific subfields of science. Both the vertical and the horizontal dimensions 
must be considered to appreciate the cultural and institutional factors which promote and reinforce 
systematic divides in career choices of adolescent boys and girls. Although, in many countries, the proportions of girls and boys interested in a science-related career 
are comparable, the types of careers which appeal to each gender are markedly different. Few girls desire 
employment in computing and engineering, while careers in health services do not attract many boys. 
Leaving science-related employment aside, socio-cultural professions appeal to girls much more than boys. 
Remarkably, this pattern holds across all PISA-participating nations, although the size of the gender gap 
varies by country. The paper also presents an analysis of potential determinants of this gap, including student academic 
performance, course-taking patterns, socio-economic background, parental occupations, students' 
placement in vocational tracks, career information and career preparation in school. While all of these 
factors make separate contributions to determining the types of careers young people expect, none of them 
can fully explain the horizontal segregation of expectations by gender.

One way of approaching the study of students' occupational plans is to see them as "supply-side" 
factors which shape the occupational composition of labour force in particular countries (Charles and 
Grusky, 2004). In contrast to "demand-side" determinants, "supply-side" factors comprise individual 
preferences, cultural climates and resources available to young people. Educational experiences can be 
expected to play a significant role in the process of crystallisation of occupational expectations, which, in 
turn, are known to be consequential for attainments. Thus much can be gained from an understanding of 
why and how young people set their minds on particular career paths. 2. 
The knowledge of student career plans enables tracing the process of preference formation and 
the extent to which plans correspond to cultural trends, respond to market changes and are forged by 
institutional factors. Psychological theories supported by empirical evidence posit that occupational 
expectations of adolescents in senior high school are formed with a relatively realistic assessment of future 
opportunities and difficulties in realising personal goals (Gottfredson 1981; Gottfredson 2002; Helwig 
2008). Sociological research confirms this proposition (Kerckhoff 1976) and, moreover, demonstrates that 
ambitious occupational plans are good predictors of high status attainment in early adulthood (Feliciano 
and Rumbaut 2005; Sikora and Saha, 2011). This is the case even after youth educational plans, 
performance and attainments are all taken into account. 3. 
More recent studies point to the possibility of a progressive  " decoupling "  between educational 
and occupational expectations and thus the weakening of the relationship between the former and latter 
(Goyette 2008; Reynolds, Stewart, MacDonald, and Sischo, 2006). One line of argument proposes that, 
despite the widely assumed link between educational achievement and productivity, educational expansion 
leads to the situation where university completion has ceased to "guarantee" future high status employment 
(Goyette, 2008: 465). Moreover, labour markets become more flexible and volatile which makes the life-
long career trajectories, typical for the baby boomers, no longer available to the younger generations. 
Nowadays, vocational objectives can be partly or entirely dissociated from educational goals if young 
people treat completing particular stages of education as  " the next life stage "  rather than a path to pursuing 
a particular career. 4. 
In any case, the information about educational expectations of students available in PISA surveys 
cannot offer insights into both vertical and horizontal segregation of students' educational plans by gender, 
as PISA collects information about the expected level but not field of future education. In contrast, the 
PISA-based information on occupational plans has the potential to reveal both dimensions of gender 
segregation, affording a more complex but also more accurate picture of cultural and institutional forces 
which promote gender divides in students' educational and occupational pathways. 5. 
From the point of view of educational policymaking the orientation in patterns of students' career 
expectations is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it reveals whether students' expectations are aligned 
with the range of available educational pathways, future employment opportunities and students' own 
educational plans. Next, this knowledge enables an assessment of the degree to which clear plans as 
opposed to "indecision", that is lack of career plans, impact on individual students' outcomes in education 
and the labour market. Such knowledge reveals the degree to which individual determination may 
compensate for lower levels of cultural, economic and social capital among the disadvantaged but 
academically able students. Finally it exposes the extent to which students themselves view their 
educational experiences as consequential for their future employment. 6. 
Cross-national comparisons of student career plans are valuable as a means of identifying 
educational and gender ideologies as well as macro-economic and institutional factors which provide a 
context for plans' formation and realisation. In particular, international comparisons of student career plans EDU/WKP(2011)3 6 can reveal how widespread gender differences are at this stage of adolescence. Lastly, students' plans can 
be compared with the actual segregation in employment to highlight the extent to which high school 
student choices translate into gendered patterns in the labour market. Data, Measurement and Method 7. 
This paper is based on the data from PISA 2006 surveys, which contained an extended module 
devoted to science performance, students' attitudes towards science as well as their perceptions of the value 
of science, including its desirability as one's future career. Of the 57 countries which participated in the 
PISA 2006 surveys, Qatar and Liechtenstein have been excluded from the analyses due to lack of 
information on the key independent variables e.g. gender. The technical details regarding the PISA 2006 
sampling design, response rates, and questionnaires with exact question wording are available in 
comprehensive technical documentation which can be accessed at www.oecd.org/pisa. Therefore we do not 
describe them here in detail. How career plans are measured 8. 
There is an important conceptual distinction between aspirations and expectations. Aspirations 
refer to life plans which are relatively unaffected by perceived social restraints, while expectations take 
these restraints into account (Saha, 1983; Saha, 1997). While up to the 1980s these concepts were often 
considered equivalent, expectations have been found to be better predictors of actual outcomes than 
aspirations (Goyette 2008). The PISA questionnaires include a single-question measure of students' 
expectations of the following form: What kind of job do you expect to have when you are about 30 years old? Write the job title:___________________________________ 9. 
The responses to this open-ended question have been classified according to the ISCO88, 
International Standard Classification of Occupations 88 (International Labour Office. 1988). It is these 
coded responses that have been used to construct scores for students' expectations on the ISEI index of 
occupational status, following the methodology outlined in Ganzeboom, de Graaf and Treiman (1992). 10. 
While a single question can be seen as suboptimal compared to multiple item measurement, 
particularly in light of concerns expressed about the variability of adolescents' plans over time (Rindfuss, 
Cooksey, and Sutterlin 1999: 231), the single question approach is a standard form of collecting 
occupational data. Moreover, longitudinal research from Australia indicates that while occupations desired 
by teenagers vary over time, their preferences in terms of occupational status are significantly more stable 
(Sikora and Saha, 2011). Teenage preferences seem particularly constant at the aggregate level, that is 
when they are grouped into major groups of an occupational classification like ISCO88 (International 
Labour Office. 1988) or similar. For instance in Australia, approximately 80 % of students aiming to work 
in a professional occupation in Year 10, continue to list one of the professions as their intended labour 
market destination also in Year 12 (Sikora and Saha, 2011). 11. 
Nevertheless, data on occupational expectations are affected, in some PISA-participating 
countries, by high levels of missing answers (Appendix 4). Because the focus of this paper is on gender 
differences in the expectations of science-related employment, it is possible to assess the differences 
between students who answered and did not answer the question about their expected occupation using a 
closely related multi-item scale on science-related future (SCIEFUT)(OECD, 2007b: 16). This scale is 
useful for this purpose as it incorporates the following statement "I would like to work in a career 
involving science" alongside three similar items. The scale has low levels of missing data (from 0.1% in EDU/WKP(2011)3 7 Korea to 10% in Israel) and the analysis of its mean values, presented in Appendix 4, reveals that, in many 
countries, there are few differences in future science career orientation for students who did and did not 
provide their expected occupation. In the eleven countries where such differences exist in girls' plans, and 
in seventeen countries in which boys' plans differ between the two groups, the differences are small 
(Appendix 4 Tables 1a and 1b). They do not exceed 20% of a standard deviation on a measurement scale 
ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 standard deviations. The scale measurement units have been standardised within 
the OECD countries. What further validates the results of this analysis is that they correspond to the 
patterns of gender composition of tertiary courses enrolment (Charles and Bradley, 2009; OECD, 2006: 
37) and employment segregation (Charles and Grusky, 2004). Method 12. 
This paper comprises two major parts with a number of sub-sections which focus on specific 
research questions relevant to students' career expectations and their differentiation by gender. The first 
part is a broad overview of the distributions in students' preferences for high status employment, 
employment in science and in particular sub-fields of science. The second part comprises a series of 
multilevel models conducted separately for each country and, where indicated, on a pooled sample of all 
countries. Descriptive analysis 13. 
Since the PISA surveys are based on a two-stage stratified cluster sample design where schools 
are sampled with unequal probability, all descriptive analyses are weighted with sampling weights to 
obtain the correct point estimates. Moreover, the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) weights with Fay's 
adjustment have been used to achieve unbiased estimates of the population sampling variances (OECD 
2007b). 14. 
In analyses where students achievement in science has been represented by plausible values 
(Mislevy et al, 1992), all the estimates were obtained using plausible values methodology. This involved 
first fitting five sets of models, each with one plausible value, and then aggregating these analyses using 
the Rubin rule (Little and Rubin, 1987). Multilevel models 15. 
Most multivariate analyses were conducted with two level random intercept models for binary 
outcomes. Some models involved continuous dependent variables and one estimation involved a three 
level model. The details of the functional form for these additional models are in Appendix 5. The focal 
analyses in this paper are based on two-level multilevel logit models. In such models (Raudenbush and 
Bryk 2002) the probability of success π ij of person i from school j is modeled using the log of the odds of 
success: The model has the following functional form : Student level (1): 0 
1 logit( ) N ij 
j 
n n 
n X π 
β 
β = = + ∑ School level (2): 0 
0 0

j u β 
γ = + EDU/WKP(2011)3 8 16. Where logit( ) ij π denotes the log of the odds of a student's expectation to work in a specific field of employment and β 0j is the constant or the intercept in school j and 00 γ is the average intercept across schools in each country. The error component u 0j is a component varying between schools within each 
country. β 1 through β N are regression coefficients for the corresponding student-level explanatory variables 
X 1 through X N. 17. 
For all types of outcomes, the robust estimation of standard errors is used as it is less sensitive to 
departures from normality and also the non-independence of observations caused by a two-stage stratified 
cluster sample design. A number of analyses presented in this paper has been replicated on the data in 
which missing values were imputed with the multiple imputation procedures. The results are available in 
the companion excel file for this publication. EDU/WKP(2011)3 9 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES: DISTRIBUTIONS OF STUDENTS' EXPECTATIONS 18. 
Across OECD and partner countries and economies, a substantial share of students' career goals 
corresponds to the top ISCO and ISEI occupation status scores, as illustrated by Figure 1. Prior studies 
based on PISA (Marks, 2010; McDaniel, 2010; Sikora and Saha, 2007; Sikora and Saha, 2009) and other 
surveys of youth going back at least three decades (Croll, 2008; Goyett,e 2008; Little, 1978; Reynolds et 
al, and Sischo 2006) consistently find that high school students tend to be quite ambitious in setting their 
educational and occupational goals. 19. 
Moreover, evidence from the United States shows that the levels of student ambition ascend from 
generation to generation (Reynolds et al, 2006). As far as occupational plans are concerned, student 
preferences tend to centre heavily on occupations which require at least some tertiary study. Most 
occupations grouped in ISCO88 (International Labour Office, 1988) under the label of 1) legislators, senior 
officials and managers or 2) professionals require a minimum of university degree at entry, extended levels 
of numeracy and literacy as well as excellent personal intercommunication skills. These skills are denoted 
by level 4 in the nomenclature of ISCO88. The occupations listed as 3) technicians and associate 
professionals require similar skills at a high level and usually necessitate from one to three years of study 
in a tertiary education institution. Few students see their future in any of the occupations listed in the 
remaining major groups, i.e. 4) Clerks, 5) Service workers and shop and market sales workers, 6) Skilled 
agricultural and fishery workers, 7) Craft and related workers, 8) Plant and machine operators and 
assemblers and 9) Elementary occupations. Nevertheless, of those who expect high status careers in high 
school, many find employment in occupations listed in groups 4 through 9 upon the completion of their 
studies (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005; Sikora and Saha, 2011). 20. 
Following an overview of cross-country patterns in students' expectations in the next section, the 
subsequent sections illustrate the key features in the vertical segregation of adolescent career plans by 
gender. Overambitious adolescents? 21. 
Participants in PISA 2006 expect to pursue highly skilled lines of employment, dominated by the 
professions and managerial positions. Among OECD countries, at least 70 % of students in Chile, Israel, 
Mexico and Turkey expect to work in occupations requiring a university degree at entry (Figure 1, the top 
map). In Greece, Portugal, Iceland, Korea and Spain over 60% of students also hope to enter highly skilled 
managerial and professional careers. In all of these countries the proportions of students oriented to high 
attainment are larger than the OECD average of 55%. On the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of 
high school students planning similar careers in the more stratified education systems of Switzerland, 
Germany, Austria, as well as in Sweden, does not exceed 40%. EDU/WKP(2011)3 10 Figure 1. Students' career plans. Proportion of adolescents expecting occupations in top ISC)88 major groups 
and average ISEI occupational status scores by country Source: PISA 2006. For estimates see Appendix Table I EDU/WKP(2011)3 11 22. 
Occupational ambition levels are yet higher among partner countries and economies. On average 
more than 64 % students in these countries intend to work in the top two major categories of ISCO88. No 
less than 70% of PISA respondents in Kyrgyzstan, Uruguay, Colombia, Tunisia, Azerbaijan and Jordan 
expect to be working in one of these occupational categories. Over 60% of their peers in Brazil, Lithuania, 
Indonesia, Chinese Taipei, Macao-China, Russian Federation, Thailand, Argentina and Bulgaria share 
similar ambitions. Only in Croatia the proportion of students hoping to become highly educated 
professionals and managers is merely 40%. 23. 
The differences in ambition levels between students across countries can be attributed to a 
number of factors. These include students' family characteristics and academic performance but also the 
specific national labour market conditions and the features of national education systems which provide 
different options for 15 year olds (Sikora and Saha, 2010). However, before considering, more 
systematically, the combined effects of these influences it is necessary to explore the descriptive 
dimensions of career plans' distributions across countries in greater depth. 24. 
When the contrast between the most ambitious students and their peers is redefined to include the 
proportions of adolescents hoping to attain not only professional and managerial but also associate 
professional occupations, the gap between OECD and partner countries and economies converges (Figure 
1, the middle map). On average 79% of students in partner countries and economies and 75% of their peers 
within the OECD harbour hopes of working in one of the jobs listed in the top three major groups of 
ISCO88. Over 80 % students from Chile, United States, Portugal, Korea, Mexico, Turkey and Israel report 
such plans. The lowest proportions of students electing careers of this type are found in Japan, Finland, 
Hungary, Switzerland, Austria and Germany where they do not exceed 60%. 25. 
Among partner countries and economies, these top three major occupational groups account for 
over 85% of choices in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Colombia, Brazil, Tunisia, and Jordan (Figure 1, the 
middle map). At the other end of the spectrum, no fewer than 65% of adolescent Romanians and Croats 
expect similar careers for themselves. 26. 
A strong focus on entering the most highly skilled professions among students in less prosperous 
countries is most evident when plans are presented on the ISEI scale of occupational status, the scores of 
which range from a low 10 to a high 90 (Ganzeboom and Treiman 1996) (Figure 1, the bottom map). 
These scores have been derived in an analysis of cross-national data in a manner which optimises the 
predictive power of education with respect to income for each occupation (Ganzeboom and Treiman, 
1996). The advantage of status scores over ISCO88 categories is that ISEI conveys the information about 
finer differences in the required education and typical financial returns to particular occupations. For 
instance, judges in courts of law receive the top score of 90, medical doctors receive 88 points while 
university professors are denoted by the score of 77 in contrast to dancers and choreographers with 64 and 
social work professionals with only 51 points. 27. 
On the ISEI scale the plans of students in OECD countries averaged 58 points compared to 63 
points on average for students in partner countries and economies. Adolescents in less affluent countries 
e.g. Mexico and Turkey and partner countries Brazil, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan, Tunisia, Azerbaijan and 
Colombia typically hoped to enter the top professional and managerial employment with ISEI scores of 65 
or higher (Figure 1, the bottom map). 28. 
Quite the reverse was the case in Switzerland, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic, where 
average scores were around 52. The lower levels of occupational expectations found in these countries are 
consistent with the allocation theory which emphasises that students in these countries are sorted into 
separate types of academic or vocational schools before they are 15 years of age (Buchmann and Park 
2009). Students who are already in educational tracks which do not lead to professional and managerial EDU/WKP(2011)3 12 employment thus report their expectations in accordance with their educational placement. This aligns with 
more realistic feedback received at school on their performance (Buchmann and Park, 2009; Kerckhoff, 
1977). In contrast, students in the more open, comprehensive systems can longer relish hopes for highly 
skilled employment, even if not all expectants have realistic chances of attaining their goals. 29. 
In addition to the apparent curbing influence of early tracking and sorting at schools, high levels 
of economic prosperity within countries also appear to be aligned with lower levels of occupational 
ambitions. In countries with high levels of development, participation in school at age 15 is nearly 
universal, while in less prosperous countries participation rates at age 15 are lower. This is a factor that 
contributes to country level differences in occupational ambitions (Sikora and Saha, 2010). Nevertheless, 
the participation rates alone do not fully explain the cross-country differences in career plans in PISA. Gender differences in student career expectations 30. 
One of the most prominent features of research on adolescent expectations based on PISA is the 
attempt to explain widespread gender differences, with girls generally reporting higher status expectations 
than boys (Buchmann and Dalton, 2002; Sikora and Saha, 2009). 31. 
Appendix Tables 1, 2 and 3 show that in almost all PISA participating countries girls expect to 
work in higher status jobs than boys. Regardless of the manner in which occupational status is measured, 
be it in ISEI scores or ISCO major groups, the difference between the proportions of girls and boys is 
positive in most countries and in many, the difference in favour of girls is substantial (Marks 2010; Sikora 
and Saha, 2009) (and Appendix Tables 1,2,3). 32. 
The finding that girls surpass boys in educational attainment and thus in hopes and plans for high 
status careers is often interpreted as a sign that gender inequalities have diminished or even reversed 
direction (Blossfeld & Shavit, 1993: 77; Marks, 2008). Yet the occupational segregation literature (Charles 
and Grusky, 2004) points out that gender inequalities must be understood not only in terms of vertical 
differentiation, captured by status and income associated with particular occupations, but also with respect 
to the horizontal segregation, which denotes gender specific niches persisting at each level of the vertical 
dimension in the employment structure. 33. 
There exists evidence of a marked disparity between adolescent expectations and adult 
attainments in Australia (Sikora and Saha, 2011), the United States (Reynolds et al, 2006) and the United 
Kingdom (Croll 2008). However, the relative differences in the extent to which boys and girls are able to 
realise their early goals have received little attention and are yet to be systematically explored. 34. 
To provide a glimpse of the actual occupational titles which appeal to students of both genders 
Table 1 presents a selection from the lists of the ten most attractive career choices compiled separately for 
boys and girls. While it contains no information on the rank of particular occupations in each country, it 
presents a mosaic of careers particularly popular among PISA 2006 respondents. 35. 
Boys and girls expect careers in different fields across countries. "Medical doctor" is the only 
occupational title mentioned by both boys and girls in more than 25 OECD countries. While girls 
nominated  " lawyers "  as their preferred career in 25 OECD countries and 17 partner countries and 
economies, boys did so in ten OECD countries and ten partner countries and economies. The same pattern 
is observable for  " authors journalists and other writers "  and  " decorators and commercial designers " . EDU/WKP(2011)3 13 Table 1. Selected occupations from the country-specific lists of the ten most popular career choices among students Boys

In 13 OECD countries and two partner countries and economies,  " architects town and traffic 
planners "  was among the top ten most popular occupations for boys, while among girls the same is 
true in ten OECD countries and two partner countries and economies. 37. 
Apart from non-manual employment young women often opt for careers in hairdressing and 
beauty industry, as shown in Table 1. Other professions favoured by girls include nursing, teaching, 
veterinary science and psychology, often referred to as "nurturance-oriented" careers (Charles and 
Grusky, 2004: 15). Other than that, many girls expect to work as authors and artists. 38. 
In contrast, the preferences of young men concentrate on professional sport, car mechanics, 
computing, engineering, and law enforcement (Table 1). Cooking also appears on the list of ten most 
popular occupations among male students. In Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Indonesia government-
related careers are particularly popular among both genders. In these Asian countries public service is 
an occupational choice that trumps in popularity even the universally coveted law and medicine. Dispersion in career plans across countries 39. 
Students' plans differ across countries also with respect to the diversity of career paths 
forming a spectrum of young people's choices. Although teenagers generally tend to choose a career 
from a relatively limited set of options (Marini and Greenberger, 1978; Patton and Creed, 2007), a 
particular concentration of plans on very few occupational titles may be of concern to vocational 
counsellors. Students' career development knowledge may also vary by gender and thus it is important 
to know whether, male and female students see themselves in equally diverse ranges of career options. 
To this end Figures 2a and 2b show the proportions of students of both sexes, who reported, as their 
intended career, one of the ten most popular occupations amongst their peers of the same sex. The 
larger the proportion within a country, the higher the concentration of students' expectations. 40. 
It is plausible to expect that the variety in students' range of choices is related to the range of 
opportunities in the labour markets, known to adolescents from their everyday experience. From the 
childhood development perspective the knowledge of potential career options among 15 year olds is 
relatively comprehensive and realistic (Hartung, Porfeli, and Vondracek, 2008; Super, 1980; Tracey 
and Sodano, 2008). In other words, students' career plans index, at least partly, the "knowledge of 'the 
real world'" (Kerckhoff, 1976: 371) as much as youth motivation. 41. 
For instance in more affluent countries, where local labour markets avail a variety of manual 
and non-manual occupational pathways which are comparable with respect to expected autonomy, 
financial returns and employment security, students' expectations may be diverse. In contrast, in 
poorer, less developed societies which experience more inequality and where returns to advanced 
education remain high (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004), students' plans may be more concentrated 
on the secure and well rewarded managerial and professional careers, even though for many hopefuls 
the chances of realising such ambitious goals are at best slim. Figures 2a and 2b lend support to this 
conjecture as, overall, the concentration of career plans in partner countries, which include many less 
affluent economies, is higher than the corresponding figures in the most prosperous of OECD nations. 42. 
Furthermore, there are also systematic differences in the concentration of career plans 
between genders. In most countries a higher proportion of girls is attracted by the ten most popular 
career choices among peers of the same sex (the OECD average is approx. 50%). In contrast, boys' 
career plans tend to be less concentrated (the corresponding average is 36%). It is possible to attribute 
these differences to the fact that historically women have been concentrated in the non-manual sector 
of employment in which only high level professional occupations are really attractive employment 
options. EDU/WKP(2011)3 15 Figure 2a. Concentration of career plans among boys in OECD and partner countries Source: PISA 2006. For exact figures see Appendix Table 7 Note: Estimates in countries denoted by grey bars are not different from the OECD average

In contrast young men in many countries can look forward to attractive employment in both 
manual and non-manual sectors where men work as managers and professionals as well as, often well 
rewarded and enjoying considerable work autonomy, tradesmen and craftsmen. Another possibility is 
that gender ideologies in many countries limit the knowledge of the diversity in career options among 
girls (Marini and Greenberger, 1978). 44. 
Moreover, it is possible that girls take into account more than boys, their future family 
obligations when planning careers (Looker and Magee, 2000). This itself, however, does not explain 
why girls' preferences are more concentrated, because girls' most preferred jobs in particular countries 
do not comprise exclusively "family-friendly" options. The cursory review, presented here, attests to 
the systematic differences in the career-related imagery embraced by adolescents of both genders. 
These divides are illustrated by the contrasts in particular types of science-related career preferences 
discussed below. Science-related careers: vertical and horizontal segregation by gender 45. 
PISA provides an opportunity to analyse both the vertical and the horizontal dimensions of 
gender segregation in students' career plans. There is vertical segregation in career plans in favour of 
girls, Overall, girls expect higher status employment compared to what is typically expected by boys. 
However, thanks to the level of detail of the data collected in PISA on science related careers, it is 
possible to contrast gender differences across different fields of science. Furthermore, the PISA 2006 
assessment focused on science and contains a wealth of data on science performance and student 
attitudes towards science as a field of study and employment. 46. 
While decades ago girls were expected to underperform relative to boys (Marini and 
Greenberger, 1978), in recent cohorts, girls in many countries have caught up with or even overtaken 
their male peers in scientific competence (Hill, Corbett, and Rose, 2010; OECD 2007a). A better 
performance among girls, however, does not necessarily mean that girls will desire to pursue science 
related careers more than boys (Looker and Magee, 2000). 47. 
Before exploring this issue further, it must be noted that any analysis of gender differences 
in preferences for a science career hinges on a specific definition of science. For instance, where 
subfields of science are distinguished, it is often found that women have made significant inroads into 
the careers in biological and agricultural sciences but continue to be dramatically underrepresented in 
computing and engineering (Hill, Corbett, and Rose, 2010). 48. 
The definition of science-related careers applied in this paper follows the PISA 2006 
questionnaire, which specified that "many jobs involve science – not just the traditional 'scientist'. 
Careers like engineer (involving physics), weather forecaster (involving earth science), optician 
(involving biology and physics), and medical doctors (involving the medical sciences) are all 
examples of science-related careers". In this paper, science-related careers comprise selected ISCO88 
titles (listed in Appendix 2, Section A) from the first three major occupational groups. 1 Occupational 
titles from major groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 have not been included. 49. 
The following section commences from an overview of gender preferences for thus defined 
science-related employment. It then proceeds to examine two subfields of science-related careers, 
computing and engineering versus health-related sciences. 1. 
PISA 2006 included a list of science careers in ISCO-88 (OECD 2007: Table A10.4). The list used in 
this document follows closely this list but introduces a number of changes. For example, code 2442 
 " Sociologists, anthropologists, etc professionals "  is no longer included while code 3141  " Ships 
engineers "  is included. Any choice will be inherently arbitrary and the inclusion or exclusion of a 
particular occupation is likely to have little impact on the final results given the small proportions of 
students who choose a particular 4 digit ISCO code. EDU/WKP(2011)3 18 50. 
Science careers are attractive to adolescents in many countries (Figure 3). The highest 
proportions of students who intend to work in some science-related occupation are, among OECD 
countries, in the United States, Israel, Mexico, Portugal and Chile, where at least 45% of students 
report that they expect to pursue such a career. Equally high or even higher levels of interest in 
science careers are also present in Brazil, Thailand, Colombia and Jordan. In contrast, in Korea, 
Hungary, Finland and a partner country Montenegro science seems less alluring to students than 
elsewhere, attracting only about 20% of choices. Figure 3. Proportions of boys and girls planning a science-related career Source: PISA 2006. For exact figures see Appendix Table 4 0.0%

Countries in which science-related careers are most popular are not necessarily the ones 
where most students achieve high scores in science tests (OECD, 2007a: Table 2.1c). In Mexico, 
Portugal and Poland, among the OECD countries, students are keen on pursuing science-related career 
although their performance in science is well behind the leading Finland, Canada, Japan and New 
Zealand. In the countries with highest science performance levels, fewer students are interested in 
science as their preferred career option. Similarly, among partner countries and economies, the 
proportions of students interested in science-related employment are moderate in Hong-Kong-China 
or Chinese Taipei relative to Colombia or, for example, Jordan. This is despite the fact that the former 
two countries have students who, on average, obtain strong results in science while the latter pair of 
countries comprises student populations with mostly average science performance. Such disparities 
may be indicative of students' relatively poor knowledge of the prerequisites and investment required 
for the highly specialised science occupations. Alternatively, the perceptions of a high prestige or 
financial returns associated with these jobs might generate an interest which is as unrealistic as it is 
widespread. 52. 
Overall, when science-related career plans are contrasted between genders in various OECD 
countries, a complex and varied pattern emerges. In some nations the proportions of girls and boys 
who plan employment in these occupations are similar (lower parts of Figure 3). In many countries 
one gender dominates the other in opting for science as the area of preferred future employment. 
There is no apparent systematic pattern, however, in who dominates whom (upper parts of Figure 3). 
Girls beat boys in their enthusiasm for science jobs in the United States, Canada, Iceland, Norway, the 
Netherlands and New Zealand but in Italy, Poland and Korea boys enthused by science outnumber 
girls. Expectations of careers in computing and engineering 53. 
While this fusion of patterns could be perceived as an indication of progressing, albeit at a 
dissimilar pace in different countries, integration of student choices, it actually results from grouping 
together various types of science careers that have a gender-specific appeal. This is illustrated in 
Figures 4 and 5 which present the proportions of boys and girls who aim specifically at entering 
engineering and computing and health-science-related employment. 2 Careers in engineering and 
computing attract relatively few girls. Among OECD countries, on average less than five percent of 
girls contemplate embarking on this path of employment (Appendix 1 Table 5). In partner countries 
and economies the corresponding average is over six percent. This is even though the definition of 
computing and engineering employed here extends to include fields like architecture, which is rarely 
considered to be one of the typically "masculine" jobs (Appendix 2, Section B). There is much cross-
country variation in the numbers of students opting for future employment in this field, ranging from 
relatively high proportions in Poland, Slovenia, Mexico, Jordan and Colombia to very low numbers in 
the Netherlands, Finland, Azerbaijan and Montenegro. 54. 
Yet, the most striking feature of these distributions is that in almost no country does the 
number of girls thinking of computing and engineering as their future career choice exceed the 
number of boys. The singular exception to this trend is Montenegro. Moreover, the ratios of boys to 
girls are quite large in most OECD and many partner countries and economies. On average, there are 
almost four times as many boys as there are girls expecting employment in engineering and 2. 
It is important to bear in mind that the categories of engineering/computing and health utilised in this 
analysis do not include all science-related occupations. These two categories account for about 75% 
of plans for science-related employment and some science occupations such as "mathematician", 
"physicist" or "psychologist" are neither in the engineering/computing nor in the health category. 
Nevertheless it is possible to relate gender differences in these two fields to the overall patterns of 
segregation previously found in studies of employment or tertiary enrolments. EDU/WKP(2011)3 20 computing within OECD and close to three times as many boys as girls in partner countries and 
economies. Expectations of careers in health services 55. 
The pattern of preferences for health-science careers by gender is a mirror image of the 
expectations related to employment in engineering and computing. Just as boys outnumbered girls in 
their enthusiasm for computing and engineering, girls who yearn for a career in health and medicine 
outnumber boys, without a single exception among countries. It is noteworthy that this holds even 
after nurses and midwives are excluded from the list of health-related careers, so the gender 
imbalance in preferences for health-related careers is not brought about solely by the traditional over-
representation of women in nursing and midwifery. Figure 4. Proportions of boys and girls planning a career in engineering or computing Source: PISA 2006. For exact figures see Appendix Table 5 0.0%

The gender gap is particularly large in Austria, Norway and Switzerland in the OECD group 
and Thailand, Latvia, and Russian Federation in the remaining countries. By contrast, boys and girls 
in Mexico, Korea and Italy, as well as Bulgaria, Indonesia and Hong Kong are closer to their peers of 
the opposite sex in their intentions to pursue careers in health. Nevertheless, this does not mean 
gender-integration of plans but only a smaller between-gender gap. What explains the horizontal segregation of adolescent career plans? 57. 
While the dramatic underrepresentation of women in computing and engineering has been 
recognised and attracted attention in particular countries, the PISA data reveal an almost universal 
presence of the gender segregation in employment expectations of youth. This segregation is present 
already at 15 years of age, in a large number of countries which differ markedly with respect to 
economic contexts and the organisation of their education systems. 58. 
Biological explanations of the persisting gender differences are particularly inept in 
accounting why women should excel in biological sciences and plan to work in many demanding, 
health-science fields (Figure 5) but at the same time shun computing and engineering jobs. 59. 
Charles and Grusky propose the concept of cultural gender essentialism, as a possible 
explanation of these patterns (2004; Charles and Bradley, 2009). Women and men's preferences and 
subsequently employment paths are rooted in cultural and institutional phenomena. The ideology of 
gender essentialism represents women as "more competent than men in service, nurturance, and social 
interaction." (Charles and Grusky, 2004: 15). To the extent to which health related occupations are 
culturally construed as involving more tasks related to these domains, the ideology of gender 
essentialism may indeed be at the root of persisting differences between the gender-specific imageries 
of desirable and a fulfilling careers. 60. 
The sections that follow systematically examine a number of possible reasons for the gender 
gap in career plans: differences in science performance, in course-taking, in family background, in the 
transfer of tastes and preferences within a family along gender lines, in students' perceptions of their 
capacity for success in science and their knowledge of what is required for a science career. Many of 
these factors affect the variation between boys and girls, suggesting possibilities for future policy 
initiatives aimed at a better utilisation of youth talent. Nevertheless, the gap between girls and boys 
remains unexplained by these factors, which, together with its universal presence across countries, 
points to global gender ideologies as the most promising explanation. EDU/WKP(2011)3 23 MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES: WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE GENDER GAP? Academic success, family background and career plans 61. 
For over three decades studies in educational psychology, sociology and other social 
sciences demonstrated that the two most influential groups of factors which shape youth motivation 
and ambition were family background and academic performance (Haller, Luther, Meier, and 
Ohlendorf 1974; Hauser and Grusky, 1988). 62. 
The meritocratic ideology, central in the ideals governing modern mass education, 
prioritises ability and effort as the sole criteria which should underpin advancement in the school 
system and in the labour market. The underlying principle of egalitarianism stipulates that gender, 
ethnicity, socio-economic status and other structural differences between students should have no 
direct effect on their quality of education and the chances of advancement in life. Even if certain 
differences between students in these groups are experienced in the education system, they should 
answer to the "different but equal" principle and neither lead to any tangible disadvantages for 
particular groups of students nor to constrain their individual preferences. Therefore to the extent to 
which meritocratic ideology and practices have been successfully instilled across the educational 
systems in the world, academic performance should be the key determinant of students' educational 
and occupational plans. 63. 
Indeed, recent research based on PISA surveys (Marks, 2010; Sikora and Saha, 2009) 
documents a positive relationship between high levels of academic performance and ambitious 
occupational goals. This relationship is, in all likelihood, one of mutual reinforcement, that is high 
level academic performance leads to ambitious occupational goals which, in turn, inspire more effort 
in educational pursuits, save for the instances where students have poor knowledge of educational 
credentials required to enter particular careers. 64. 
But academic performance is by no means the only strong booster of ambitious plans. 
Theories of allocation, risk aversion and elite reproduction (Bourdieu, 1984; Bourdieu, 1986; Breen 
and Yaish, 2006; Kerckhoff, 1976) posit that even in the era of modern meritocratic education the 
children of the highly educated parents in highly skilled employment benefit from more generous 
endowments in cultural, economic and social capital. These endowments advance the children of elite 
to experience educational success beyond the levels typical for their equally academically able but 
more socially disadvantaged peers. The risk aversion theory, backed up with some empirical studies 
(Breen and Yaish, 2006; Golthorpe, 2007), proposes that the children in higher status families at 
minimum expect to attain as high an educational and occupational position as their parents. Therefore, 
such children continue their education beyond compulsory years, even when their academic 
performance is only moderately successful. Moreover, such children, taking their parents' attainment 
as a natural benchmark, are likely to be firmly oriented towards high status occupational employment 
for themselves. By contrast, the children of lower status parents need much higher motivation or far 
more academic success to be enticed to continue in education past the compulsory threshold. 
Regardless of these differences, in strongly meritocratic systems both groups of students should 
advance primarily through academic performance, that is, either effort or talent. In these systems 
occupational expectations should be linked more strongly to academic success than to family capital. 65. 
Most PISA 2006 participating countries appear to have education systems which closely 
approach so defined meritocracy as students' career plans in most places are better predicted by 
academic performance than by family economic, social and cultural resources. Figure 6 presents EDU/WKP(2011)3 24 regression coefficients from a two level random intercept model in which students' expectations 
expressed in the ISEI status scores have been regressed on their performance in science and their 
family of origin's economic, social and cultural status. In this instance ISEI scores have been used to 
conserve space as the patterns for students who wish to work in particular science fields are 
essentially the same. For comparability the independent variables, that is, the science scale 
performance scores and the status of family home, have been standardised to a mean of zero and the 
standard deviation of one across all OECD countries. These standardised coefficients can be 
interpreted as the change in average ISEI occupational status score which is associated with a change 
of one standard deviation on either students' science performance or the family status scale. Figure 6. Relative importance of students' academic performance and economic, social and cultural

In most countries science performance is a stronger predictor of high status occupational 
expectations (Figure 6) than students' socio-cultural and economic capital. This is the case for boys 
and girls. But there are some exceptions from this pattern as the economic, social and cultural capital 
of a student's family predict as well as school performance future career plans in Japan for students of 
both genders. In Kyrgyzstan and Brazil the performance of girls is unrelated to their occupational 
expectations which is atypical. 67. 
Notwithstanding the stronger impact of science performance than family background on 
student career expectations, in many countries family background nonetheless has a bearing on the 
expected status of students' future employment net of students' performance. As Marks (2010) pointed 
out in his analysis of career plans in PISA 2000, the strong version of meritocracy hypothesis would 
require a complete absence of the family background effects. Despite the undeniable progress of 
meritocracy in education systems across the world, students from advantageous home environments 
continue to expect better jobs than their equally able peers from less privileged homes. 68. 
Regardless of the obvious relationship between the cultures of meritocracy and 
egalitarianism and their apparent prevalence in most countries, the horizontal segregation of career 
plans by gender persists. While across countries most students are oriented towards the managerial 
and professional employment and high achievers are particularly ambitious, the fields of employment 
that attract young men and women continue to be distinct. Gender socialisation and career plans 69. 
Notwithstanding the consensus over the declining gender differentiation in socialisation 
practices within home and school environments, the proposition that a child is influenced more by the 
parent of the same sex has received attention and even some support in recent research (Kleinjans, 
2010; Marks, 2008). The key expectation of the same-sex-socialisation theory is that daughters are 
influenced and inspired by their mothers' rather than their fathers' attainments. Likewise, sons are 
more likely to look up to and follow into their fathers, rather than their mothers' footsteps. Within this 
perspective family role-modelling processes work most effectively along gender division lines and 
thus for instance while the daughters of engineer fathers might be more likely to contemplate a career 
in engineering than adolescents who have no engineers in their family circle, the daughters of female 
engineers should be particularly well poised to consider a similar career for themselves. The key 
foundation for this preference is the child's "expert" understanding of not only the content of the 
parent's job but also of day-to-day strategies which enable success in combining the heavy human 
capital investments necessary for these careers with gendered roles and identities outside of the world 
of work. The gender socialisation hypothesis is potentially attractive where persistent differences 
between boys and girls, as these occurring in career plans, cannot be explained by biological theories, 
the differences in sex-specific academic strengths or an absence of policies designed to foster 
egalitarian gender attitudes. But it must be noted that it is not optimal for understanding the situation 
of youth in single parent families or the families with parents of the same sex. 70. 
Prior research which sought to establish whether academic results of boys and girls 
participating in PISA surveys were more influenced by the characteristics of fathers or mothers found 
at best a modest support for the sex-socialisation hypothesis (Marks, 2008). Nevertheless, in several 
countries, it could not be entirely dismissed. The PISA 2006 report found little or no relationship 
between expectations of employment in science and having a parent employed in one of science fields 
(OECD, 2007a). In contrast to this finding Figure 7 below highlights that, in many countries, parents' 
occupational profiles are positively associated with their children's plans to pursue employment in 
similar areas. 71. 
Figure 7 displays coefficients from two-level logit models predicting the likelihood of 
planning employment in computing or engineering or in health services as a function of mother and EDU/WKP(2011)3 26 father's employment in these fields. The model incorporates only two independent variables as the 
total influence of fathers and mothers' characteristics is pertinent here, regardless of the mechanisms 
through which parents in particular professions sway and support their children in considering similar 
career paths for themselves. 72. 
Overall, the cross-national evidence in support for gender socialisation hypothesis with 
regard to occupational plans is moderate but non-negligible. Boys follow in the footsteps of their 
fathers more often that girls (Figure 7). In a number of countries, for instance in Japan, Mexico or 
Poland, having either parent working in health enhances the children's interest in this field regardless 
of the sex of the parent. The stronger influence of fathers' employment in health on their daughters' 
plans in Italy, Poland or Lithuania contrasts with the logic of the gender socialisation theory but is in 
accordance with the expectation of within-family transfer of tastes and preferences for particular types 
of carers. By contrast, in many countries, e.g. Bulgaria, Colombia or Estonia, the profile of parents' 
employment was unrelated to the career expectations which students reported in PISA 2006. 73. 
On the whole there is stronger evidence of a transfer of tastes between fathers and sons than 
mothers and daughters which corresponds to the findings of studies concerned with educational 
attainment (Kleinjans, 2010; Marks, 2008). The number of countries where this relationship for men 
in the family is significant is larger than the number of countries with the corresponding effects for the 
women. 74. 
The link between parents', particularly fathers' employment in health, and children's hopes 
of entering a career in health and medicine is stronger in a large number of countries than the 
intergenerational transfer of preferences for computing and engineering. What impedes the attempts to 
test the gender socialisation hypothesis with regard to the within-family transfer of tastes for 
engineering and computing is an almost total absence of engineers and computing scientists among 
mothers in the sample. On average the proportion of mother engineers does not exceed half a percent. 
By contrast, there are between 1% and 3 % of fathers who work in these occupations. Figure 7 shows 
only coefficients in countries in which at least 0.5 % of parents of each sex were in each group of 
occupations of interest, and, moreover, in which there were at least 5 students whose expected career 
corresponded to employment held by their parent of the same sex. As there are very few mothers 
employed in engineering and computing, even the application of these liberal criteria led to a dearth of 
the information necessary for establishing any relationship between mothers' employment and their 
daughters' plans. The influence of parents' employment in health on children's occupational plans is 
easier to ascertain, thanks to the higher proportions of both mothers and fathers working in the 
relevant occupations. 75. 
Alternatively, the very low counts of engineer mothers in the PISA sample could be seen as 
evidence in support of gender socialisation hypothesis. A shortage of female role models within the 
family circle who "normalise" the perception that engineering and computing as a domain fully 
accessible to women, may well prevent girls from planning this type of employment. In contrast, in a 
number of countries, the coefficients depicting a son's preference for engineering and computing as a 
function of his father's work in these fields is positive and significant. Hence, in more locations, boys 
seem to have higher chances than girls of being exposed, within their own family circle, to the 
experiences and role models which normalise engineering and computing as a professional activity 
appropriate for their sex. EDU/WKP(2011)3 27 Figure 7. Coefficients from two-level logit models predicting the probability of a student choosing a career in the same field as the parent. Only coefficients statistically significant at p = 0.05 level 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 Australia

Mother works in engineering/computing EDU/WKP(2011)3 28 Can science performance explain differences in career plans of boys and girls? 76. 
The assessment of science performance in PISA 2006 showed that in many countries boys 
performed on a par with girls (OECD, 2007a). This was the case, for instance, in United States, 
Canada or Poland. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, Denmark or Mexico girls' science performance 
lagged somewhat behind that of their male counterparts. Finally, in yet other countries, girls 
outperformed boys in science, as for instance in Jordan, Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece (OECD, 2007a). 
In countries where there are no gender disparities in science competence, there can be no relationship 
between them and gender differences in career expectations. However, does science performance play 
a role in driving career expectations in countries where boys and girls do not perform equally well in 
science? 77. 
The goal of the analysis in this section is to ascertain the extent to which controlling for 
differentials in science performance and course taking can explain the gap in the interest boys and 
girls have in engineering or computing (Tables 2a and 2b) and health-sciences (Tables 3a and 3b). 
Apart from student science performance and familial environments, one factor which received 
attention as a possible driver of gender differences in career preferences is the differential course 
taking in upper years of secondary high-school (Xie and Shauman 2003). 78. 
Some researchers argued that young women begin opting out of advanced mathematics and 
science courses at quite early stages in their education and thus simply do not possess the appropriate 
credentials at the time when entry to science university degrees would be possible (Xie and Shauman 
2003). However, recent evidence from the USA does not support this hypothesis. Throughout the 
1980s and 1990s average gender differences in math and science performance were small but 
American boys were markedly more likely than American girls to be among the top 5% maths and 
science achievers. However, neither difference was consequential for the gender gap in expectations 
to complete a science-related degree (Xie and Shauman 2003). 79. 
PISA 2006 has the information on students' participation in compulsory and optional 
courses in general science, biology, chemistry and physics. Each student was asked about his or her 
participation in such courses in 2006 and the preceding year, i.e. in 2005. Although the data on 
course-taking are not strictly comparable between countries due to the curricular and program 
differences, it is possible to construct a measure of course participation which is suitable for 
comparisons between genders within each country. After initial analyses, in which all questions on 
course-taking were treated as separate variables, the information on compulsory and optional course 
participation in both years was combined to create a variable indicating exposure to each subject area. 
This variable ranged from zero, if a student took no compulsory or optional courses in the year of 
assessment or the previous year, to four, if both types of courses were taken in both years. 80. 
Coefficients from two-level random intercept logit models are presented in each table for the 
OECD (in tables annotated with an "a") and partner countries (in tables annotated with a "b"). The 
science performance scale and the variables depicting course-taking in particular areas of science are 
control variables in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b below. 81. 
The change in the gender gap in students' expectations due to control variables can be 
observed by comparing the first two left-hand columns in each table. For instance, in the Slovak 
Republic, where the proportions of boys and girls who expect a career in engineering or computing 
are very different, the gender coefficient changes from the baseline Model 1 "-2.18" to "-2.06" in 
Model 2 (Table 2a). The latter model can be interpreted as representing a hypothetical situation in 
which boys and girls do not differ at all with respect to science performance or science subjects taken 
at school. EDU/WKP(2011)3 29 Table 2a. Science performance, course-taking and expected career in engineering. OECD countries. Expected career in computing/engineering Model 1

0.15 *model controls also for the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) 
Coefficients from two-level random intercept models 
Coefficients in bold are statistically significant 82. 
The exponentiation of these two coefficients gives the odds ratios of: e -2.18 = 0.11 and e -2.06 = 
0.13. Thus the odds of Slovak girls which depict the plan to work in engineering or computing are 
only 0.11 of the odds for Slovak boys in the first model. When the controls for "differences in science 
performance" and "course-taking" are introduced, the odds for girls rise to 0.13. Thus, there is 
effectively no change in the gender gap that can be attributed to these control variables. The greater 
propensity of girls to shy away from computing and engineering has little to do with the variation in EDU/WKP(2011)3 30 science performance or course participation between sexes, although it is the higher achievers in 
science who do contemplate such careers at all. This is the case in all OECD countries. 83. 
The order of countries in Table 2a follows the decreasing gender gap. While, within the 
OECD, in the highly differentiated education systems of the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, and the 
internally differentiated the USA and the United Kingdom have students with the most sex-segregated 
preferences for engineering, the gap between sexes in Israel, Estonia and Iceland is considerably 
smaller. In Iceland the odds of expecting a career in engineering for girls are 0.48 (e -0.73 =0.48). This is 
considerably more than the figure for the Slovak Republic (e -2.18 =0.11), but this estimate changes very 
little after the introduction of the controls equivalent to the assumption that girls and boys have 
identical science achievement and take the same science subjects. 84. 
Good results in science assessment are positively correlated with an inclination towards 
engineering or computing in all OECD countries. With respect to course-taking, students who do 
courses in biology are less likely to consider engineering as their career path, what is indicated by the 
mostly negative coefficients in Table 2a. Chemistry courses do not discourage students from 
considering this type of employment in Italy, Spain, Estonia and Portugal, but make little difference in 
most other places. Finally, the physics courses have a strong association with computing and 
engineering careers in many of PISA 2006 participating countries, including Italy, the Slovak 
Republic, Ireland and Korea. 85. 
The relationship between science performance, course-participation and plans to work as an 
engineer or computer scientist is similar in most partner countries. However, in contrast to the OECD, 
where girls are less than boys prepared to consider this type of a career, girls in Montenegro, 
Indonesia and Bulgaria are as willing as boys to enter engineering and computing. The gender gap 
decreases a little after controlling for science performance and course taking in the UK, Hungary, 
Germany and Belgium. Yet, in no country can the gender gap in expectations be entirely explained by 
the differences in science performance and course-taking. 86. 
In another analogy with the OECD patterns, specific high school courses seem conducive of 
contemplating engineering as a career in only a handful countries. Biology, as a subject, decreases 
chances of planning a career in engineering in Romania and Chinese Taipei. Physics courses raise an 
interest in these careers in Croatia, Kyrgyzstan, Hong-Kong and Jordan. Tunisia is the only place 
where more participation in physics courses actually decreases an interest in engineering. 87. 
Tables 3a and 3b present the results of two-level logit regressions which predict 
expectations of a career in health sciences from the same set of science-learning predictors. 88. 
As previously shown, in all OECD countries, girls are far more interested in health-related 
careers than boys, which is also the case when nursing and midwifery are excluded. The largest 
difference between girls' and boys' interest in health is in Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands 
where female students are more than five times as likely to plan employment in this field (e.g. for 
Switzerland e 2.07 =7.92 which means that girls' odds of expecting a career in health are almost eight 
times larger than the odds for boys). The smallest gap in the enthusiasm for health as a career is 
between boys and girls is in Mexico, Greece and Korea, but even there girls are nearly twice as likely 
as boys to hope to enter the health sector as employees. EDU/WKP(2011)3 31 Table 2b. Science performance, course-taking and expected career in engineering. Partner countries Expected career in computing/engineering Model 1

Coefficients from two-level random intercept models 
Coefficients in bold are statistically significant 89. 
A solid performance in science increases chances of planning a career in this group of 
occupations everywhere. Taking courses in general science also has a positive impact, illustrated by 
coefficients greater than zero in many OECD countries, with the sole exception of Italy. Studying 
biology and chemistry in high school correlates with students' hopes to work in health, although the 
relationship is not statistically significant in many nations. In contrast, if participation in physics 
classes is statistically different from zero, its association with health career expectations tends to be 
negative: physics rarely (only in France and Slovenia) goes together with the expectations of working 
in health. 90. 
The comparison of the gender coefficients in the baseline Model 1 and Model 2 with the 
controls reveals that had girls not differed in any way from boys in their science performance and 
patterns of course-taking, they would be even more keen on careers in health, surpassing the levels of 
interest among boys by even greater ratios. 91. 
This tendency is visible in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France and Hungary, to name only a 
few countries. The largest predicted increase in the likelihood of girls expecting health careers, net of 
performance and course participation is in Portugal where the odds of girls rise from 3.63 (which 
equals e 1.29 ) to 5.16 (i.e. e 1.64 ). EDU/WKP(2011)3 32 Table 3a. Science performance, course-taking and expected career in health. OECD countries Expected career in health sciences Model 1

The relationships between the predictors and the dependent variable in partner countries are 
analogous to those found in OECD countries. Bulgaria and Montenegro are an exception as in these 
two countries, there is no difference in health career expectations between the two genders. The 
largest differences are in Russia, Thailand and Lithuania. EDU/WKP(2011)3 33 Table 3b. Science performance, course-taking and expected career in health. Partner countries Expected career in health sciences Model 1

Coefficients from two-level random intercept models 
Coefficients in bold are statistically significant 93. 
On the whole, most of the differences between boys and girls in career expectations cannot 
be attributed to the gender differences in science performance, where such occur, or to gender 
differentiation in the distribution of students across various science courses. Largely independent of 
these two factors, girls tend to shun computing and engineering, while boys are less attracted to health 
professions. 94. 
While much attention has been devoted to the underrepresentation of women in certain 
fields of science (Hill, Corbett, and Rose, 2010; Howel, Blaisdell, Figueiredo, Gorham, and Hatch 
2005; Matyas and Dix 1992), the question that emerges from this analysis is whether similar concern 
should not be raised over the underrepresentation of young men among health career seekers. While it 
is true that women continue to be crowded in the lower status health occupations (Grusky and Charles 
2004) they have also been making inroads into top status health jobs. Supplementary analysis, not 
shown here, in which midwifery and nursing were excluded from the list of health occupations, 
confirms the much higher interest among girls in careers within this subfield of science. Given these 
patterns in adolescent occupational expectations, it is possible that, in the future, the segregation of 
men into computing, engineering and physics and women into biology, agriculture and health will not 
only continue but further intensify. 95. 
Another aspect of students' educational experiences which may be relevant to expectations 
is the timing of students' branching out into vocational versus academic tracks. In many countries 
women have fewer employment opportunities outside of the non-manual sector and thus there is a EDU/WKP(2011)3 34 marked overrepresentation of men in manual employment (Charles and Grusky, 2004). Therefore it is 
likely that the gender divide evident in the labour market is likely to manifest as early as the first 
educational transition in which students are divided between academic and vocationally oriented 
programs. This is because the former are, down the track, related to non-manual and the latter to 
manual employment. In some PISA-participating countries such a transition occurs before the age of 
15 but in others students are not grouped into specific programs until later (PISA 2006 Database 
Table 5.2). If boys are more likely than girls to populate vocational programs, this difference in 
student distributions can affect the size of the gender gap in science-related career plans. Occupational ambitions of students in vocational tracks at age 15 96. 
Students' placement in either vocationally or pre-vocationally-oriented programs is a factor 
defining not only educational but also career options. It is the first transition which encourages 
students, for the first time in their lives to seriously and realistically assess their future educational and 
occupational prospects. Students in vocational tracks are generally less oriented towards the highest 
status occupations (Sikora and Saha, 2009) and thus, by definition, less likely to nominate, as their 
goal, one of the science-related occupations in the top ISCO88 major groups. 97. 
Table 4a presents the effects of placement in a vocational program on chances of planning 
employment in engineering and computing or health (Models 2a). Because in some countries there are 
no students in vocational tracks but instead the PISA sample comprises students at lower and higher 
International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels (UNESCO, 2006), an alternative 
version of the model (2b) utilises ISCED level as an indicator of important educational transitions 
which might foster serious thinking about future educational and career prospects. The estimates are 
provided only for countries in which at least 3 percent of students in the sample could be identified as 
pre-vocational or vocational track placements. The influence of such placement on career plans 
related to either health or engineering is present in only some countries. In Italy, Japan, Korea, 
Mexico and the Slovak Republic vocational program placement is actually conducive of planning 
employment in engineering or computing. In contrast in Belgium, it has a deterring impact. 98. 
A vocational track placement decreases chances of expecting employment in health sciences 
in all OECD countries where the relationship is statistically significant. In some contrast to the 
vocational program, ISCED level has no systematic relationship to these particular career plans. 99. 
The important feature of analyses in Tables 4a and 4b is that, as was the case with science 
performance and course taking, vocational program placement makes no difference to the gender gap 
in career expectations. This pattern is consistent across all countries, as even when point estimates for 
the gender coefficients change, they do so by a relatively small margin. EDU/WKP(2011)3 35 Table 4a. Vocational track, ISCED level and expected career in engineering or health. OECD countries. Expected career in

This examination of country-by-country patterns in vocational placement and ISCED level 
differences brings no insights into the reasons behind the gender gap in science-related career plans. 
Students in vocational tracks are less likely to consider health science careers in a number of 
countries, and in several countries such placement fosters more interest in engineering and computing 
as fields of future employment. Overall, however, these variables make little contribution to 
explaining the differences in preferences between boys and girls. 101. 
Although there are no reasons to expect that the gender gap in expectations might be related 
to the migrant status within student populations, it is informative to consider the contrast between the 
migrant and native stock students as a supplement to the gender gap analysis. Before proceeding to 
the examination of socio-psychological variables related to students' confidence in individual abilities 
and self-efficacy the next section focuses on the differences in plans of the migrant and native 
students. Occupational ambitions of migrant students 102. 
Ethnic minority students, in country-specific studies, had been often found to have higher 
than expected levels of aspirations and expectations (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005; Khattab 2003; EDU/WKP(2011)3 37 Portes, McLeod, and Parker 1978; Wells, Bills, Park, and Chen 2007). Economic, social and cultural 
resources of immigrant students are often limited compared with wealth and cultural competence of 
locally born students. This is why in many countries which experience steadily rising inflows of 
migration, foreign born students have been lagging in performance, compared with non-migrants 
(OECD, 2007a: 175). Yet, American studies found that first and second generation migrant youth held 
 " very high ambitions and hopes of the future "  (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005: 1088) despite systematic 
evidence that migrant students underperform by a significant margin. This lower level of performance 
has been confirmed in a number of PISA-participating countries whose student populations include 
non-trivial numbers of migrant children (Ammermueller 2007; Heus, Dronkers, and Levels 2008; 
OECD 2007a; Rangvid 2007). Since the PISA surveys include only students fluent in the national 
language in which tests are administered, the actual effect of the migration status may be 
underestimated and thus, in reality, even more substantial. 103. 
In many OECD countries (Table 5a) migrant students have stronger hopes to secure science-
related employment than their locally born counterparts. In this analysis migrant students comprise 
both those foreign born and those identified as second generation migrants, because preliminary 
analyses which considered these groups separately revealed few differences between them. However, 
only countries in which migrant students comprise at least 3 percent of the student population have 
been included in the analysis in this section. 104. 
Migrant students are also more interested in health-science employment in many OECD 
countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and a number of countries in Western 
Europe. This is consistent with the expectation that the children of migrants are particularly oriented 
towards upward mobility and the attainment of high status jobs. This analysis suggests that science-
related employment might be the preferred path of advancement in a number of countries where 
migrant students account for a non-trivial part of adolescent population. Although academic 
achievement of migrant students falls behind that of their native counterparts in many countries in 
which migration policy does not favour skilled migration (OECD, 2007a: 175), overall, there is a 
positive association between migrant status and ambitious occupational plans. This finding is 
noteworthy as it poses interesting questions for policy makers. While migrant students in many 
countries perform at a lower level, they are optimistic and hold high expectations with regard to their 
future occupational achievement. Where their socio-economic background is often significantly lower 
than the mainstream average, they aspire as high as their native peers; where their socio-economic 
background matches that of their native peers, they expect more of themselves. The challenge for 
educational policymaking is to effectively convert these high levels of ambition into more academic 
success. EDU/WKP(2011)3 38 Table 5a. Migrant students and expectations of future employment in engineering or health. OECD

Coefficients from two-level random intercept models 
Coefficients in bold are statistically significant 105. 
Controlling for students' immigration status makes no difference with respect to the gender 
gap in preferences for engineering and health-science, which here is the central concern. The ambition 
bonus that comes with growing up in a migrant family is similar for adolescent men and women, so 
this additional dimension adds to the context rather than the explanation of the gender divide. Attitudes, beliefs and expectations of a career in science 106. 
A natural progression from an unsuccessful attempt to attribute the variation in career plans 
to the gendered differences in science performance is to seek an explanation of the gender gap in 
career plans by exploring the socio-psychological predispositions of boys and girls. 107. 
Sociologists (Correll, 2001; Marini and Greenberger, 1978; Xie and Shauman, 2003) and 
economists (Humlum, Kleinjans, and Nielsen 2010) proposed that social psychological factors 
depicting gendered identity and reflecting the gendered systems of cultural values are the key to 
understanding of segregation in adolescent career plans. In Norway, a study of high school students 
demonstrated that female students tended to prefer career types associated with higher levels of 
intrinsic rewards (Huang 2009). Recent studies in economic psychology report that women can be less 
keen on competition and thus opt for careers which they perceive as driven less by competition and EDU/WKP(2011)3 40 more by social co-operation and care (Humlum, Kleinjans, and Nielsen, 2010). All of these 
explanations are consistent with the logic of the cultural gender essentialism thesis proposed by 
Charles and Grusky (2004), except that these studies focus on micro-social or psychological 
manifestations of what can be seen as a global institutional culture which shapes adolescent identities 
and the social constructions of femininity and masculinity. In line with its predictions, studies in the 
USA found that girls in high school who enrol in maths and science classes of highest difficulty see 
themselves as "less feminine, attractive, popular and sociable" (Matyas and Dix 1992; Xie and 
Shauman 2003: 48). Thus if imageries associated with certain professions seem to be in profound 
opposition to the cultural norms of femininity or masculinity, the choice of a career incompatible with 
such norms must come at a high cost, despite the promise of potential material or non-material 
rewards. 108. 
The analysis in this section focuses on indicators of students' self-efficacy and self-concept 
to explore the possibility that girls have lower levels of self-confidence in their science performance 
and thus are less likely to seek more demanding careers. Both science self-efficacy and self-concept 
are the potential causes of gender differences according to the argument which posits that girls, 
despite their equally good performance in science, lag behind boys in self-confidence and thus see 
little point in investing effort and time in their science skills. Prior analyses of science self-concept, 
showed that boys in most PISA 2006 participating countries had higher levels of belief in their own 
abilities than girls (OECD, 2007a: Table 3.21). In some countries the differences were substantial. 109. 
The first measure, science self-efficacy, probed students' perceptions that they could easily 
"Recognise the science question that underlies a newspaper report on a health issue"; "Explain why 
earthquakes occur more frequently in some areas than in others"; "Describe the role of antibiotics in 
the treatment of disease"; "Identify the science question associated with the disposal of garbage"; 
"Predict how changes to an environment will affect the survival of certain species"; "Interpret the 
scientific information provided on the labelling of food items "; "Discuss how new evidence can lead 
you to change your understanding about the possibility of life on Mars" and "Identify the better of two 
explanations for the formation of acid rain" (OECD, 2007a: 134; OECD, 2007b: 323) 110. 
The second measure, science self-concept, comprised students' self-evaluation in response to 
the following items : "Learning advanced science topics would be easy for me", "I can usually give 
good answers to test questions on school science topics ", "I learn science topics quickly", "Science 
topics are easy for me", "When I am being taught science I can understand the concepts very well" 
and "I can easily understand new ideas in science" (OECD, 2007b: 323). 111. 
Overall, as evident in Tables 6a and 6b, science self-concept is a better predictor of 
expectations to work either in engineering or in health than science self-efficiency. 112. 
While, in many countries, coefficients for self-efficacy are not significantly different from 
zero, the belief in one's own ability is positively associated with an expectation to work in engineering 
or computing in many countries. There are exceptions to this pattern as neither attitudinal variable 
contributes any explanatory power in Switzerland, the USA, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Portugal, 
Mexico, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria or Estonia, as far as engineering is concerned. In some contrast to 
this trend, the positive association between science-related self-confidence and a plan to enter health 
sector employment holds in all OECD countries, without a single exception. 113. 
While the discussion of these patterns is informative in its own right, the key goal of the 
analyses in this section is to explore factors which might be capable of bridging the gender gap. 
Attitudinal variables, which relate to self-confidence and self-efficacy, while most relevant to 
occupational expectations, make no contribution to the explanation of the gender differences in 
preferences for these particular career fields. In other words, while boys and girls differ in their 
confidence levels with respect to science performance, this difference cannot account for the 
horizontal segregation of their occupational plans within the broad field of science. EDU/WKP(2011)3 41 114. 
Gender coefficients in Model 1 and Model 2 change very little. Thus, although boys feel far 
more comfortable about their science ability in many countries within and outside of OECD (OECD, 
2007a: Table 3.21), the gender difference in confidence levels cannot be seen as a key to 
understanding why students of each gender strongly prefer their own particular niche of science 
employment. When the difference in science self-efficacy and self-concepts between students is taken 
into account, the gender gap remains as it was in the baseline estimation. All of the factors so far 
considered foster a stronger likelihood of considering a science-related employment. But these 
contributions are above and beyond the systematic gender divide, which is ubiquitous in almost all 
countries, with only some variation in size. 115. 
PISA 2006 included a series of questions designed to collect information about students' 
perceived career preparation and career information levels. 116. 
The first group of questions, combined into a scale, comprised four items which probed 
students' perception of being well prepared by their school for a possibility of pursuing a career in 
science (CARPREP) (OECD, 2007b: 331). Students were asked whether their schools gave them the 
basic skills for future science employment, whether science subjects offered at school were well 
suited to the preparation for a broad range of such careers. Moreover, students were also asked 
whether science classes they were enrolled in served well the purpose of science career preparation 
and whether teachers were effective in imbuing students with relevant skills. The following 
statements constituted the scale: "The subjects available at my school provide students with the basic 
skills and knowledge for a science-related career"; "The school science subjects at my school provide 
students with the basic skills and knowledge for many different careers"; "The subjects I study 
provide me with the basic skills and knowledge for a science-related career"; " My teachers equip me 
with the basic skills and knowledge I need for a science-related career" (OECD, 2007a: 331). 117. 
Students participating in PISA 2006 have been also asked whether they felt well informed 
about "Science-related careers that are available in the job market"; "Where to find information about 
science-related careers"; "The steps a student needs to take if they want a science-related career" and 
"Employers or companies that hire people to work in science-related careers" . A multi-item scale 
CARINFO was constructed from these items (OECD, 2007a: 331). 118. 
If levels of information and the feeling of being well prepared for a science-related career 
differ systematically between genders, such differences might be conducive to the variation in 
readiness to plan a science-related career. However, as evident in Table 7a, while these factors are 
related to higher probability of planning employment in engineering or health in many countries, they 
do not explain the persisting gender difference in preferences for these subfields of science. 119. 
The perceptions of oneself as well prepared and informed about the prospects of a science 
career are positively associated with the plan to work in health in many countries, while the 
associations between such perceptions and the plan to pursue engineering are less frequent. Only in 
the UK, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands do both perceptions foster a higher likelihood of 
planning a computing or engineering career. In Poland, Hungary, Finland and Lithuania there is even 
a negative association between the sense of being either well informed or well prepared for a science 
job and the plan to pursue an occupation in engineering and computing. In contrast, plans for careers 
in health are mostly positively associated with higher levels of self-assessed career information and 
preparation. These differential patterns point to the possibility that, in many countries, a number of 
pro-engineering choices is made by adolescents in the context of little information about the nature 
and requirements of these jobs. Therefore, it is possible that more comprehensive information 
programs, focused on these particular occupations, could increase the number of students who 
develop an interest in them. Conversely, where such programs already exist, the lack of association 
between high information levels and the intention to work in these occupations is consistent with the 
assumption that preferring or shunning engineering is driven primarily by the deeply entrenched 
gender ideologies which construe some occupations as more appropriate than others for particular 
sexes (Howel et al, 2005). If such gendered ideologies permeate the family and out-of-school EDU/WKP(2011)3 42 environments of adolescents, isolated efforts of counsellors operating from schools are doomed to 
encounter resistance from young people whose strong sense of gendered identity has already been 
formed (Howel et al, 2005). Table 6a. Science self-efficacy and self-concept and expectations to work in engineering or health. Expected career in computing/engineering

Coefficients from two-level random intercept models 
Coefficients in bold are statistically significant 120. 
Individual differences between students exert significant influences on occupational status 
of expected careers and on the intentions to pursue specific science careers. In many countries, high 
achievers, migrant students, students who consider themselves better informed about science-related 
employment options are all more likely to plan to work in science. Yet, for any two students who 
differ only with respect to gender and are otherwise identical, a female student is far more likely to 
opt for health science than engineering. A male student will make the opposite choice. This tendency 
is unexplained by any of the individual level characteristics canvassed in the preceding sections. School level factors 121. 
Prior studies of gender typed adolescent career plans found a number of school 
characteristics which boost higher status expectations among students. These characteristics are 
school resources, the compositional features of school populations and particular processes which 
manifest in the formal and informal culture of school. EDU/WKP(2011)3 46 122. 
For instance schools in urban areas, which cater to the children of well-educated managers 
or professionals, have students with higher ambition levels. There, student occupational ambition 
exceeds levels implied by particular family backgrounds. Well-resourced schools with high level of 
access to information technology, private schools, schools which are selective, that is refuse 
admission to the less academically successful students foster very high occupational ambition among 
their pupils (Marks, 2010; Sikora and Saha, 2009). Selective and affluent school environments convey 
the "affluent community" boost to students' plans and expectations. A student from a modest social 
background is thus likely to expect more educational and occupational success as such expectations 
are normalised in the school's cultural environment. 123. 
Yet, while all of these factors have a positive relationship with the intentions to enter high 
status employment, almost none of these factors have any predictive power with respect to intentions 
to work in engineering as opposed to the health sector. 124. 
The country specific two level logit models which introduce school characteristics as control 
variables in are provided in Tables 8a and 8b below. Only percentage of girls in school and the 
averaged socio-economic status are reported, although the models controlled also for the teacher to 
student ratio, an indicator of whether a school employed a counsellor on regular basis, an scale 
measuring the school activities aimed at promoting science (SCIPROM) and the principal's perception 
that teachers in the school concentrated on developing in students the skills and knowledge essential 
for science careers. Other control variables contributed a negligible increase to the models' 
explanatory power and therefore are not presented here. 125. 
To allow for the variation in the effect these variables might have on students' plans the 
analyses were conducted separately by gender. In most countries these school characteristics have no 
consequences for occupational plans oriented towards specific subfields of science. 126. 
However, as Table 8a illustrates, in several countries there is evidence that boys attending 
schools with large proportions of females in student populations are less likely to go along with their 
own sex's preferences for engineering and computing. While girls attending schools dominated by 
their own gender are even more reluctant to contemplate these fields of employment, the effect for 
boys, instead of being no different from zero, is, where significant, in the same direction as the effect 
for girls. This is the case in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Slovak Republic and 
Slovenia. In several countries the attendance of school with higher proportions of girls may temper 
boys plans even if it has no extra influence on girls. This is the case in Chile, Hungary, Ireland, Korea, 
Portugal, Turkey and the USA. EDU/WKP(2011)3 47 Table 8a. Compositional factors: percentage of girls, parents' status and expectations of a career in

These effects could be interpreted as support for cultural explanations of gender typing if the 
numbers of girls can be seen as a proxy for cultural factors in operation in particular schools. 
However, these effects can be only tentative evidence, as there are many countries in which the 
proportion of girls within a school is irrelevant to students' occupational intentions related to 
engineering. The effects of school populations' average SES, where consequential, indicate that 
engineering can be popular in schools with lower and higher SES profiles. 128. 
In some analogy to the patterns emergent in the analysis of school composition effects and 
engineering, in several countries boys who attend schools with high representation of girls are more 
likely, above and beyond their individual inclination, to consider health services as their future career 
(Table 8b). However, this is not the case in all countries where this factor is relevant. Attending a 
school with a large population of girls deters boys from this line of employment in Australia and 
Bulgaria. In many places gender school composition is irrelevant and the effects of school 
population's SES are highly variable from country to country. 129. 
Overall, the aspects of school environments examined here seem of limited relevance to the 
gender differences in preferences for particular subfields of science. It is possible that more detailed 
indicators of gender cultures within schools could reveal the processes which in some schools help 
bridge and in others perpetuate the horizontal gender segregation of occupational intentions. The 
evidence available in PISA 2006 indicates that, in at least several countries, the gender compositional 
effect points to the future promise of such investigations. However, until more direct measures of 
gender role attitudes and cultures within schools are available for many countries, no more insights 
about the impact of gender ideologies on these outcomes are possible. EDU/WKP(2011)3 49 Table 8b. Compositional factors: percentage of girls, parents' status and expectations of health science

Country characteristics which have been demonstrated to foster more ambitious career 
expectations among youth comprise several factors in a specific configuration (Sikora and Saha, 
2010). Students in less prosperous countries where participation rates in secondary education are 
lower, where the levels of economic disparities are substantial but where employment opportunities 
within the service sector expand rapidly, cherish strong and unanimous hopes for high status 
employment. This tendency is enhanced by the absence of early sorting into academic and vocational 
streams at the age of 15 as well as the reception of direct financial aid from abroad by the national 
education sector (Sikora and Saha, 2010). 131. 
Official aid, administered by the United Nations and the associated international agencies, is 
usually tied to various forms of educational expansion programs which are built around the global 
ideology of meritocracy and egalitarianism in education. Obviously aid is directed to developing 
countries, but receiving aid to education is a strong predictor of students' higher occupational 
ambitions also when differences in economic wealth and inequality between countries are taken into 
account (Sikora and Saha, 2010). Thus high school students in countries which experience poverty 
and inequality are motivated not only by relative deprivation coupled with the fast pace of expansion 
in national labour markets but also the promises of the meritocratic and egalitarian ideologies 
advanced by international aid and co-operation. 132. 
In contrast to the average status of expected occupations, the tendency of female and male 
students to opt for a career in one of the subfields of science considered here is not systematically 
aligned with many country characteristics, be they economic or related to the features of national 
education systems. The Gender Gap Index which measures the degree to which countries provide 
equal access for men and women to economic, educational and political resources, regardless of the 
level of economic development appears to have a negative relationship with all dependent variables in 
Table 9 (Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi, 2006). The GGI effect is statistically significant only as a 
predictor of boys' propensity to plan a health-related career. However, the negative coefficients seem 
to suggest that in more gender egalitarian societies the propensity of both genders to plan a career in 
engineering/computing or health is weaker than in nations with higher levels of gender inequality. 
Early tracking of students into a larger number of programs or types of schools lowers the likelihood 
of planning a career in health among boys and girls and in engineering among girls only. The former 
is likely to be associated with the incompatibility of early vocational streaming and school pathways 
which lead to medicine and other health-related employment. The latter suggests that early streaming 
into vocational tracks may deter girls but not boys from considering engineering/computing as future 
area of employment. 133. 
Finally higher levels of economic development are associated with lower likelihood for 
girls of planning employment in engineering while boys in more affluent countries are less likely than 
boys elsewhere to expect a health related career. While the segregation literature (Charles and 
Bradley, 2009: 945) suggests that girls in more developed countries are overrepresented in health-
related university degrees, the GDP coefficient for girls' expectations of health employment is not 
different from zero. EDU/WKP(2011)3 51 Table 9. Expectations of career in health/engineering. Coefficients from three-level random intercept models Girls

This comprehensive examination of the patterns in the vertical and horizontal segregation in 
youth career plans reveals that occupational expectations of 15 year olds are segregated by gender in a 
manner resembling gender segregation in university enrolments and in the labour market. The broad 
picture is that girls expect to work in higher status jobs than boys. Moreover, science is as popular among 
girls as it is among boys in many countries. But a closer examination of science-related employment, 
discloses each gender's strong preference for its own niche of science, namely, health versus engineering 
and computing. While this form of horizontal segregation in adolescent plans was previously documented 
in a number of single-country studies, this paper demonstrates for the first time that this type of segregation 
is prevalent in a many countries that differ markedly in their educational systems and socio-economic 
conditions. The omnipresence of this pattern defies the country-specific explanations and calls for the 
consideration of global cultural ideologies as the framework for understanding the persisting segregation of 
students' occupational expectations first documented in the 1960s and 1970s (Holland 1997; Marini and 
Greenberger 1978). The cultural theory of gender essentialism which asserts the persisting association 
between culturally construed gender identity and particular types of jobs aligns with the patterns found in 
this analysis. Because the construction of gender identity models is cultural rather than biological, 
historical changes to the entrenched associations between gender and particular types of employment are 
certainly possible. 135. 
The cultural processes of socialisation which distribute the young people into different niches of 
national labour markets associate students' occupational expectations with different fields of employment 
by Year 9 of high school. The analytical strategy of examining a large number of potential reasons why 
these preferences are so firmly segregated so early leads to an unequivocal conclusion. Neither the gender 
gap in the preferences for engineering and computing nor for health sciences can be explained by the broad 
range of high school experiences. The differences between genders in academic performance, family 
social, economic and cultural resources, students' migration status, vocational program and ISCED level 
placement, career information and preparation as well as self-confidence in science ability might exist but 
they do not bridge or widen gender disparities in preferences for particular types of science employment. 
At 15 years of age students' career goals, if present, are already strongly gender typed and this gender 
difference seems largely unrelated to the varying levels of academic performance or self-confidence 
although systematic differences between sexes in performance and confidence are evident in many 
countries. Policy implications 136. 
The starting point in any attempt to develop policy guidelines emerging from this research must 
involve a decision whether this type of horizontal segregation is a social problem. Is there an identifiable 
talent loss at the individual and societal levels which can be attributed to the concentration of women and 
men into different fields of employment? Arguably such talent loss may be considerable as the creative 
activity of engineers and computing scientists is likely to benefit from gender diverse insights. For instance 
anecdotal evidence indicates that an absence of women from engineering teams designing new products 
and technical solutions results in ignorance of gender-specific user needs and thus in potentially sub-EDU/WKP(2011)3 53 optimal designs. Moreover, the underrepresentation of men in healthcare and other care-based occupations 
is likely to adversely affect the progressively greying societies in which care industries expand while 
struggling to attract a diverse pool of workers. 137. 
There is much scope for a more comprehensive provision of educational programs which not 
only popularise engineering and computing amongst girls, but also aim to raise the level of interest in care 
and healthcare among boys. However, the important caveat is that such programs cannot be conceived as 
isolated, locally implemented initiatives. They must coexist with a host of "social, cultural and economic 
changes that are large scale and are interdependent" (Xie and Shauman 2003: 214). As Xie and Shauman 
point out, isolated policy programs are unlikely to be effective in implementing and consolidating such 
broad changes in the institutional and cultural contexts in which women make their career choices. Rather 
the universal nature of these horizontal divides calls for initiatives from international agencies supporting 
educational policy at country level. Moreover, they must be implemented at much earlier stages of 
students' educational experiences and with support of parents, as the influence of the latter on their 
children's vocational intentions is non-trivial. 138. 
The entrenched cultural climates of gender essentialism cannot be attributed to a single process or 
failure within the educational institutions. These differences in youth expectations are most unlikely to be 
primarily reinforced by lack of educators' efforts to achieve gender integration in school environments 
(Howel et al. 2005). Rather, these divides are most likely too firmly established by the time students reach 
their 15th birthday to be easily mediated by simple educational policy or vocational counselling measures. 139. 
Nevertheless, cross-national differentiation in the perceived desirability of engineering and 
computing raises questions about the effectiveness of vocational counselling services within the education 
systems of particular countries. Gender ideologies are undeniably cultural phenomena and their 
entrenchment in institutional settings, media discourses and everyday life creates a context in which even 
the best designed counselling programs, while not without chances for success, are likely to encounter 
difficulties. The relative shortage of prominent role models, that is "female celebrities" in engineering and 
computing, the well-publicised underrepresentation of women in these fields, their reputed family 
"unfriendliness" and adolescents' day-to-day experiences often defy the encouragement girls receive from 
the educators and policy makers. 140. 
The difficulties facing future policy initiatives designed to bridge the disparities between young 
men's and women's occupational choices lay in the complex network of micro-social processes which 
reproduce these gender-specific patterns. While various information campaigns within and outside schools 
are launched to entice young women into traditionally masculine fields of employment and, less 
frequently, to encourage men to enter feminised professions, they appear to be no more than "surface 
veneer" egalitarianism (Charles and Grusky, 2004). The messages from the policy makers often do not 
correspond to the messages transmitted by the media, the actual gendered patterns of employment known 
to youth from their every-day observations and the ideology of cultural gender essentialism which 
constructs women as better suited to occupations related to nurturance, care and managing interpersonal 
relationships. In contrast to the educational campaigns which encourage girls to take up computing and 
engineering, the programs designed to direct boys towards nursing or midwifery or teaching are few or 
non-existent so the efforts towards employment desegregation can be seen so far as partial at best. This is 
attributable to the popularity of "separate but equal" ideology, which sees genders as necessarily belonging 
in different niches of the labour market (Charles and Bradley, 2009). In this approach, the goal of policy is 
solely to be concerned about the vertical segregation by gender in educational and occupational 
expectations and attainments. However, even if monetary returns and status of segregated careers were 
equivalent, crowding men and women into different fields of employment can be associated with a number 
of social disadvantages. EDU/WKP(2011)3 54 141. 
Despite the difficulties in designing and implementing policies aimed at gender integration in all 
fields of education and employment, the inroads that women have made into various areas of science, 
including engineering, over the last four decades are promising. Yet, the focus of policy must widen to 
include the measures to entice adolescent men to enter non-traditional areas of employment. While several 
isolated policy programs are unlikely to bring gender segregation in its vertical and horizontal forms to an 
end, the more broadly conceived policy programs, supported by the international agencies, have the 
potential to bring about change. The change at the level of students' individual choices, through early 
broadening of perceptive horizons, might not be possible, however, without some institutionally enforced 
employment and educational gender equity incentives that specifically address horizontal segregation by 
gender. 142. 
Adolescent occupational expectations align closely with patterns in graduation rates across 
tertiary institutions. Among science graduates women have made strides in agriculture, health and biology 
but not other areas. While the difficulties with combining the demanding science careers and family life are 
likely to be important deterrents, the fact that across the world girls at 15 show a remarkable unity of 
opinions in preferring health science to other types of science is consequential. It reveals cultural forces 
reinforced by a conglomerate of social micro processes and structures of opportunities. 143. 
The reverse side of these trends is that boys need enticement to enter health and teaching-related 
occupations in greater numbers. The severe underrepresentation of women amongst physicists, 
mathematicians, engineers and computer scientists is undesirable but so is having only token numbers of 
men in socio-cultural, health, and care-related professions. Cultural constructs which frame particular types 
of employment as "feminine" or "masculine" limit the full realisation of individual talent. This process 
begins early, is cumulatively reinforced over the life course of young people and universally present. Thus 
its amelioration requires a mobilisation of policy which will lead to the shift in values, perceptions, 
institutional incentives and labour market opportunities. Such a mobilisation seems possible only through 
the co-ordination of cross-national policy efforts. EDU/WKP(2011)3 55 REFERENCES Ammermueller, Andreas. 2007. "Poor Background or Low Returns? Why Immigrant Students in Germany

employment Appendix 3 summarises the information about students who saw their future in education, 
law, arts and social sciences. While the cursory overview of occupational titles listed most frequently by 
PISA respondents suggested that teaching was likely to appeal to both young men and women, the 
proportions of young women who choose teaching, and other socio-cultural professions (the full list of 
which is in Appendix 2 Section D) outweigh the numbers of young men by a large margin. Japan is the only country where socio-cultural professions attract more boys than girls, but it is also 
the only country where the information about students' plans was coded only to two, instead of four digit 
level of ISCO88. Thus this exception must treated with caution. In all other countries employment in these 
fields attracts more girls than boys. The disparities between countries in the size of the gender gap are not 
as strongly pronounced as in the case of health and computing/engineering employment. Nevertheless at 
least twice as many girls as boys plan a socio-cultural career in Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Austria, Greece, 
Spain, Luxembourg, Finland and the Czech Republic in the OECD group. At least as large a gender gap in 
these preferences exists in Macao-China, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, 
Croatia, Russian Federation and Jordan. These patterns are consistent with the proposition that gender ideologies entrenched in educational 
institutions, labour markets and the popular culture are powerful forces operating, at least to some extent, 
in much varied economic, political and social conditions in a notably similar manner. EDU/WKP(2011)3 74 Appendix 3 Figure 1. Proportions of males and females planning a career in socio-cultural professions Source: PISA 2006. For exact figures see Appendix 3 Table 1 below 0.0%

countries and therefore the impact of missing information must be systematically considered. While the construction of student achievement scores and most attitudinal indices in the PISA data 
results in reduction of missing data, in some nations the proportions of uncodable responses and missing 
data on occupational expectations are high. The survey question about career plans is difficult to answer 
for some students (see Appendix Table 7). Missing and uncodable responses range from 8 to 53%. In 
almost all countries girls and students who are more successful academically are more likely to respond to 
the question about occupational expectations. In contrast male students and those less academically 
successful tend to skip this question. Firstly, it is possible that students considered this particular question to be a  " test "  question, and thus 
the more academically oriented students felt a stronger obligation to give a valid answer. Thus the fact that 
the background questionnaire is administered in the context of a school test might adversely affect these 
students for whom the test situation is particularly confronting. For example, students completing an 
academic-oriented questionnaire where there are  " right "  and  " wrong "  answers, might be inclined to regard 
the educational and occupational expectation questions to have  " right "  and  " wrong "  answers. Gender differences in levels of missing data are substantial and in almost all countries girls are more 
likely to provide information about their future career plans. It is possible, as was argued in the context of 
other studies, that girls tend to form concrete plans regarding their future at earlier stages in high school 
than boys (Feliciano and Rumbaut 2005). Therefore girls are more likely to give some answer to questions 
regarding plans for the future while boys are more likely to find such questions difficult to answer and 
annoying (White 2007). Moreover, in some countries, the average academic performance of girls exceeds, 
if by a small margin, the average performance of boys which may widen the gap in the likelihood of 
engaging with this question. The gender difference in the rates of missing answers may be reflecting higher levels of average 
compliance with the school culture among girls. Schools usually encourage developing educational and 
occupational ambition as part of vocational counselling and a part of the broader education process. This 
compliance can be facilitated by the fact that women tend to be concentrated in non-manual employment 
sectors and thus the list of careers known to be entered by women which are attractive in terms of social 
status is both shorter and possibly better known among adolescents. At least in Australia the ability and readiness to answer the question about career expectations has 
been found to be a good predictor of young adults' success in the labour market (Sikora and Saha, 2011). 
Relative to their high school peers who found this question too difficult to answer, young Australians who 
had a concrete occupational goal in high school tended to begin their adult career in higher status positions. 
This was the case even after the differences in academic performance in high school, university completion 
and plans regarding education have been taken into account. Because the focus of this paper is on gender differences in the expectations of science-related 
employment, it is possible to assess the differences between students who answered and did not answer the 
question about their expected occupation using a closely related multi-item scale on science-related future 
(SCIEFUT)(OECD, 2007b: 16). This scale is useful for this purpose as it incorporates the following 
statement "I would like to work in a career involving science" alongside three similar items. The scale has 
low levels of missing data (from 0.1% in Korea to 10% in Israel) and the analysis of its mean values, EDU/WKP(2011)3 77 presented below, reveals that, in many countries, there are few differences in future science career 
orientation for students who did and did not provide their expected occupation. In the eleven countries 
where such differences exist in girls' plans, and in seventeen countries in which boys' plans differ between 
the two groups, the differences are small (Appendix 4 Tables 1a and 1b). They do not exceed 20% of a 
standard deviation on a measurement scale ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 standard deviations. The scale 
measurement units have been standardised within the OECD countries. Appendix 4 Table 1a

variables and multi-level models with continuous outcomes. For outcomes which were binary variables the three level model specified the probability of expecting an occupation within a specified subfield of science ( ) ijc π of person i from school j and country c using log of the odds: (

/ (1

+ ∑ where β 0j is the constant or the intercept in school j and 00 γ is the average intercept across schools in each country. The error component u 0j varies between schools within each country, Β n=1 through β N are 
regression coefficients for corresponding student-level explanatory variables X n=1 through X N. Moreover, r ij, 
which is error varying between students within a school, is also specified. In multilevel logit models, this 
individual error term is omitted due to identification problems (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002). Binary outcomes -three-level models For the three-level estimation with country-level covariates the models had the following form: Student level (1): 0

+ ∑ Country level estimates are in the third equation and subscript c denotes regression coefficients at this 
level. Country-level covariates (X 00n=1 through X 00N ) correspond to regression coefficients (X 00n=1 through 
X 00N ) while 000 η denotes the average intercept across countries. The error component 0c h varies between countries. All estimates have been obtained with robust standard errors which is appropriate to offset the impact 
of any non-normality of outcomes and non-independence of observations due to a two-stage stratified 
cluster sample design. In three level models the sampling weights as per Pfeffermann et al. procedure were 
used (Pfeffermann, Skinner, Holmes, Goldstein, and Rasbash 2002). To ensure that each country 
contributes equally to the analysis the student final weights were also normalised at the country level.
