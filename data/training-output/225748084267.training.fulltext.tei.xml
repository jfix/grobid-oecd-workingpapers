			<head>ABSTRACT<lb/></head>

			<p>Most OECD countries have endorsed as major policy objectives the reduction of inequalities in health<lb/> status and the principle of adequate or equal access to health care based on need. These policy objectives<lb/> require an evidence-based approach to measure progress. This paper assesses the availability and<lb/> comparability of selected indicators of inequality in health status and in health care access and use across<lb/> OECD countries, focussing on disparities among socioeconomic groups. These indicators are illustrated<lb/> using national or cross-national data sources to stratify populations by income, education or occupation<lb/> level. In each case, people in lower socioeconomic groups tend to have a higher rate of disease, disability<lb/> and death, use less preventive and specialist health services than expected on the basis of their need, and<lb/> for certain goods and services may be required to pay a proportionately higher share of their income to do<lb/> so.<lb/></p>

			<p>Options for future OECD work in measuring health inequalities are provided through suggesting a small<lb/> set of indicators for development and inclusion in the OECD Health Data database. Some indicators<lb/> appear to be more advanced for international data collection, since comparable data are already being<lb/> collected in a routine fashion in most OECD countries. These include the indicators of inequalities in self-<lb/>rated health, self-rated disability, the extent of public health care coverage and private health insurance<lb/> coverage, and self-reported unmet medical and dental care needs.<lb/> Increased availability and comparability of data will improve the validity of cross-national comparisons of<lb/> socioeconomic inequalities in health status and health care access and use. Harmonisation of definitions<lb/> and collection instruments, and the greater use of data linkages in order to allow disaggregation by<lb/> socioeconomic status, will determine whether health inequalities can be routinely monitored across OECD<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Les politiques de santé dans la plupart des pays de l&apos;OCDE ont comme objectifs majeurs la réduction des<lb/> inégalités en matière de santé et le respect du principe d&apos;un accès adéquat ou égal aux soins basé sur les<lb/> besoins. Des données robustes et fiables sont nécessaires pour mesurer l&apos;atteinte de ces objectifs politiques.<lb/> Ce document de travail évalue la disponibilité et la comparabilité de certains indicateurs de l&apos;inégalité de<lb/> l&apos;état de santé et de l&apos;accès et de l&apos;utilisation des soins dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, en se concentrant sur les<lb/> disparités selon les groupes socio-économiques. Ces indicateurs sont illustrés à partir de sources de<lb/> données nationales ou internationales qui permettent de distinguer les populations par niveau de revenu,<lb/> d&apos;éducation et d&apos;emploi. Dans tous les cas, les personnes appartenant à des groupes socio-économiques<lb/> désavantagés ont tendance à avoir des taux de morbidité, d&apos;incapacité et de mortalité plus élevés, à utiliser<lb/> moins de services préventifs et de soins spécialisés que ce à quoi on pourrait s&apos;attendre sur la base de leurs<lb/> besoins, et à payer une plus large part de leur revenu pour se procurer certains biens et services de santé.<lb/> Parmi les options de travaux futurs de l&apos;OCDE figure le développement d&apos;un petit ensemble d&apos;indicateurs<lb/> clés dans le domaine des inégalités en santé qui pourraient être intégrés dans la base de données Eco-Santé<lb/> OCDE. Certains indicateurs semblent plus avancés que d&apos;autres pour une collecte de données<lb/> internationales, puisque des données comparables sont déjà collectées régulièrement dans la plupart des<lb/> pays de l&apos;OCDE. Ces indicateurs comprennent les indicateurs d&apos;inégalité dans l&apos;état de santé général<lb/> perçu, l&apos;incapacité auto-déclarée, le degré de couverture des soins de santé publics et de l&apos;assurance<lb/> maladie privée, et les besoins de soins médicaux et dentaires non satisfaits.<lb/> Accroître la disponibilité et la comparabilité des données améliorerait la validité des comparaisons<lb/> internationales des inégalités socio-économiques de l&apos;état de santé et de l&apos;accès et de l&apos;utilisation des soins.<lb/> Pour que l&apos;évolution de ces inégalités soit mesurée de manière régulière dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, il faudra<lb/> harmoniser les définitions et les méthodes de collecte de données entre pays, et développer les possibilités<lb/> de lier différentes sources de données au niveau national afin de permettre une désagrégation selon le statut<lb/> socio-économique.<lb/></figure>

			<table>1.<lb/> There have been substantial improvements in average levels of health outcomes in developed<lb/> countries over the past 50 years as demonstrated by the health status indicators in OECD Health Data, and<lb/> as summarised in Health at a Glance 2007. Life expectancy at birth has increased on average in OECD<lb/> countries from 68.5 years in 1960 to 78.6 years in 2005, infant mortality has declined from 29 deaths per<lb/> 1 000 live births in 1970 to 5 in 2005, and ischaemic heart disease mortality rates have fallen from 178 per<lb/> 100 000 population in 1980 to 96 in 2004. Premature mortality – years of life lost before age 70 – has been<lb/> cut by more than half on average since 1970 (OECD, 2007a).<lb/></table>

			<p>2.<lb/> Differences in health continue to exist among populations, despite the gains of the past half<lb/> century. These health differences are apparent along many dimensions including age, gender, race or ethnic<lb/> group, geographic area and socioeconomic status. These differences, also known as variations or<lb/> differentials in health, are here referred to as health inequalities or disparities. Health inequalities which<lb/> are avoidable and are considered to be &quot; unfair &quot; according to some social norm which may vary across<lb/> countries, are here termed health inequities (<ref type="biblio">Kawachi et al., 2002</ref>).<lb/> 3.<lb/> Health inequality is a global issue, involving rich and poor countries alike. The importance of<lb/> health inequalities and their determinants, along with the unfairness and avoidability of health inequities,<lb/> has recently been underlined by the release of the Final Report of the World Health Organization&apos;s<lb/> Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH, 2008). Central to the Commission&apos;s work was<lb/> examining how health is distributed across the social spectrum and how the social conditions in which<lb/> people grow, live, work and age determine health. The Commission has emphasised that social<lb/> determinants of health produce widespread inequalities in health within and between societies. These<lb/> inequalities can be measured and described, and the evidence from this process can be used in producing<lb/> policies and programmes for change.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The growing research interest in health inequalities has required an evidence base to be<lb/> developed, so that these inequalities can be better understood. Recent work on developing this evidence<lb/> base has followed two broad strands. The first examines social and economic determinants of health and<lb/> health inequalities among different groups in society, often defined by income, education, occupation or<lb/> some other measure of socioeconomic status. The second strand deals with low or differential use of health<lb/> services among different economic or other groups (<ref type="biblio">Gwatkin, 2007</ref>). These two strands are explored in this<lb/> paper.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The objective of this paper is twofold. First, to review the availability and comparability of<lb/> leading indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in health care access and use in OECD<lb/> countries, illustrated by examples using existing data. Second, to outline the steps required to improve the<lb/> availability and comparability of these leading indicators, in order to promote regular monitoring of<lb/> progress toward policy goals of reducing health inequalities and providing adequate or equal access to<lb/> care. 1<lb/> 1<lb/></p>

			<p>No indicators of socioeconomic disparities in health care quality are proposed in this paper, since the<lb/> development of a reliable and comparable set of health care quality indicators is still at an early stage under the<lb/> 6.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarises leading indicators that can be used to measure socioeconomic inequalities in<lb/> health within the two domains of health status and health care access and use, and indicates in broad terms<lb/> the data developmental work needed to improve the availability and comparability of data across OECD<lb/> countries. The paper expands on this summary by giving examples of how these indicators have been used<lb/> in research. Data availability and constraints are discussed in further detail, and conclusions are drawn on<lb/> the steps required in order to be able to collect such data in a comparable manner across OECD countries.<lb/> OECD&apos;s Health Care Quality Indicators (HCQI) project. Regarding inequalities in non-medical determinants<lb/> of health, the OECD Economics of Prevention project has begun to collect data on a number of determinants<lb/> of health (overweight and obesity, physical activity and nutrition) by level of education and other aspects of<lb/> socio-economic status, which may lead to an eventual extension of the regular OECD data collection for those<lb/> determinants that will be assessed as being most available and comparable across countries (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2009</ref>).<lb/> Regarding inequalities in health care financing, one relevant indicator is included in this paper – out-of-pocket<lb/> expenditure by income group. Determining progressivity in other types of financing mechanisms (general<lb/> taxation, social security contributions, and private health insurance) falls outside the scope of this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>A FOCUS ON SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> Health inequalities exist along many demographic or social dimensions, including sex, age, racial<lb/> and ethnic group, geographic area and socioeconomic status. The usual starting point in measuring health<lb/> inequalities is to examine variations by sex and age, and OECD Health Data already reports these for<lb/> several health status measures. It indicates, for instance, that while a substantial gap in life expectancy<lb/> remains between men and women, the gap has narrowed in most OECD countries over the past twenty-five<lb/> years (OECD, 2007a). Mortality data also indicate that the distribution of ages at death among both men<lb/> and women varies widely across OECD countries (OECD, 2007b). As a next step, the focus is to review<lb/> the availability and comparability of measures of health disparities by socioeconomic status, including<lb/> their interactions with sex and age.<lb/> 8.<lb/> In almost all countries and in different health systems, a socioeconomic gradient in health status<lb/> exists. As socioeconomic disadvantage increases, the circumstances in which people live and work are<lb/> more detrimental, there is an increase in the behaviours which worsen risks and so worsen health<lb/> outcomes, and an accompanying increase in morbidity and mortality. Populations may be divided into<lb/> groups characterised by social stratification, with individuals occupying higher or lower levels on a<lb/> hierarchy – their position on this hierarchy being their socioeconomic status (SES). Persons of lower SES<lb/> – typically those with a lower income, a lower level of education, or in a less prestigious occupational<lb/> group – tend to have a higher prevalence of illness and disease, can expect to live less years in good health,<lb/> have higher mortality rates and die at younger ages. The health burden attributable to socioeconomic<lb/> disadvantage is large.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Socioeconomic inequalities are evident not only in population health status, but also in the access<lb/> to, and use of health care services. Poorer or less educated persons, despite having higher rates of illness,<lb/> disease and death, often have difficulties in locating appropriate specialist and preventive health services,<lb/> they use these services less, and for certain goods and services they may be required to pay a<lb/> proportionately higher share of their income to do so.<lb/> 10.<lb/> Socioeconomic inequalities in health have been observed among different SES groups both<lb/> within and between countries, regardless of affluence or political or social systems. These inequalities have<lb/> not diminished in recent decades and in some cases have widened. This finding implies that inequalities are<lb/> deeply entrenched within the social structures of modern societies, and it provides a warning that<lb/> reductions in health disparities might be difficult to achieve in the short term (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach, 2006;<lb/> Mackenbach et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/> 11.<lb/> Most national administrations have developed public policies and strategies to reduce<lb/> socioeconomic inequalities in health status (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Acheson et al., 1998; Department of Health, 2003; AHRQ,<lb/> 2008; Judge et al., 2006; Mackenbach &amp; EUROTHINE, 2007</ref>). Attempts to quantify the economic impact<lb/> of health inequalities have pointed to substantial gains that might be made through their reduction (<ref type="biblio">Walker,<lb/> 2005; Mackenbach et al., 2007</ref>). Many OECD countries have also endorsed as a major policy objective the<lb/> principle that access and use of health care should be based on need, and not the ability to pay (OECD,<lb/> 2004a). Each of these policy objectives requires an evidence-based approach to measure progress.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Identifying and measuring the burden of ill-health in socially disadvantaged sections of the<lb/> population provides great potential for improving the average health status of the whole population. Cross-<lb/>country comparisons of socioeconomic inequalities in health status, and in the access and use of health<lb/> services can suggest areas for improvement for health administrations, and can provide possible policy<lb/> directions that aim at their reduction. The information gained from the measurement of inequalities gives<lb/> an impetus and focus for policy makers, as well as a yardstick by which to assess interventions and gauge<lb/> progress.<lb/> 13.<lb/> For these reasons, the focus in this paper is on examining inequalities in health by socioeconomic<lb/> status. The universal prevalence of socioeconomic inequalities in health, and the importance of education,<lb/> income and occupation as determinants of health, makes a strong case for selection. This does not negate<lb/> the importance of other dimensions that are used to examine inequalities in health, such as geographic area<lb/> or race and ethnicity. In a number of OECD countries, racial and ethnic disparities in health remain a great<lb/> challenge (<ref type="biblio">Kawachi et al., 2005; Mead et al., 2008</ref>). Health differences by geographic area, especially with<lb/> respect to access to care in remote areas, are also an important policy concern in many countries. A recent<lb/> OECD publication has reviewed a number of measures adopted in OECD countries to increase the supply<lb/> of doctors in remote and underserved areas (OECD, 2008).<lb/></p>

			<head>Selection of leading indicators of health inequalities<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presented a set of leading indicators that might be used to measure different<lb/> socioeconomic inequalities in health status, and in health care access and use. The selection of these<lb/> indicators has been based mainly on the criteria of relevancy, interpretability and feasibility (assessed in<lb/> terms of data availability and comparability).<lb/> 15.<lb/> Indicators for measuring inequalities in health status have been grouped into three categories:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) indicators related to life expectancy and mortality, (ii) indicators related to morbidity and disability, and<lb/> (iii) composite indicators which include both mortality and morbidity information.<lb/> 16.<lb/> Indicators for measuring inequalities in health care access and use here include: (i) health<lb/> insurance coverage, (ii) health care utilisation in relation to different services, (iii) measures of unmet care<lb/> needs, and (iv) out-of-pocket expenditure as a share of household income. A further indicator of &apos;effective<lb/> coverage of interventions&apos;, which was suggested recently as part of the refinement of the WHO framework<lb/> for health system performance assessment and which has been tested at the state level in Mexico, is<lb/> discussed in Annex 1.<lb/></p>

			<head>Classifying social groups<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> Socioeconomic status, the hierarchy used here to classify or stratify social groups, can be ordered<lb/> in numerous ways. The most common of these are by using educational level, occupational group and<lb/> income level or wealth. Indices comprised of more than one measure of SES may also be used. 2 A number<lb/> of international classifications of these stratifiers of SES can be used to facilitate cross-national<lb/> comparison.<lb/> • Educational level is typically measured by a hierarchical classification of the population by<lb/> completed education. Under the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) at<lb/> least four categories are identified, corresponding to elementary, lower secondary, upper<lb/> secondary and tertiary. Part-time and vocational training are also included, but are difficult to fit<lb/> into the hierarchy.<lb/> • Occupation information is used to divide the population into a number of groups, with<lb/> distinctions often made between farmers, unskilled and skilled manual groups, self-employed,<lb/> and lower and upper non-manual groups. The International Standard Classification of<lb/> Occupations (ISCO) can be used to identify more specific categories of occupation. A person&apos;s<lb/> occupational group may vary throughout their working life, but it is usually determined by the<lb/> individual&apos;s current or last occupation.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Income level can be classified according to individual income, or by the household equivalent<lb/> income – household income adjusted for size and composition, i.e. numbers of adults and<lb/> children. The entire population may then be classified into a number of groups of equal frequency<lb/> for analysis (e.g. five-groups: quintiles, or ten-groups: deciles). Income level may also be<lb/> analysed by using national poverty lines in order to determine SES.<lb/></p>

			<head>Measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health<lb/></head>

			<p>18.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are many measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health, and they vary in complexity.<lb/></p>

			<p>These measures differ in at least two ways: (i) whether they measure relative or absolute differences in<lb/> health, and (ii) whether the measurement technique is simple or sophisticated (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach &amp; Kunst,<lb/> 1997</ref>). The choice of which is most appropriate depends largely on the objectives of the particular study<lb/> being undertaken.<lb/></p>

			<head>19.<lb/> Relative or absolute differences</head>

			<p>– Measurement can be expressed as a relative difference (for<lb/> example, a rate ratio) or an absolute difference (for example, a difference in rates). Both are important, as<lb/> the theoretical example in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates. Assume two population groups A and B that have seen large<lb/> falls in mortality rates between two reference years 1970 and 2000, with the gap between the two also<lb/> narrowing. In 1970, the gap was 30 deaths per 100 000 population, coming down to only 10 in 2000. The<lb/> ratio of deaths per 100 000 population between groups A and B has increased from two in 1970 (60/30) to<lb/> three in 2000 (15/5). The mortality rate of both groups has improved and the absolute gap between them<lb/> has narrowed, however Group A&apos;s relative position has not improved; and in 2000 it was worse. The<lb/> illustration highlights that to gain a better understanding of the health status of the two groups, both<lb/> measurements should be considered. Absolute measures are important for decision-makers, especially<lb/> when goals in absolute terms have been set, because they allow a better appraisal of the magnitude of a<lb/> public health problem (<ref type="biblio">Schneider et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1: Relative and absolute differences in socioeconomic health inequalities<lb/> 0<lb/> 15<lb/> 30<lb/> 45<lb/> 60<lb/> 75<lb/> 1970<lb/> 2000<lb/> Year<lb/> Group A<lb/> Group B<lb/> Deaths per 100,000 population<lb/></figure>

			<head>20.<lb/> Simple or sophisticated measures</head>

			<p>– Simple measures of inequality such as the rate difference and<lb/> the rate ratio between lower and higher socioeconomic groups allow for ease of calculation and<lb/> interpretation. These measures of the &apos;gap&apos; between two population groups generally only considers health<lb/> inequalities between the two extreme groups, such as the highest and lowest income groups equivalent to<lb/> quintiles 1 and 5 if a population is divided into five equal groups. Gap measures emphasise the situation of<lb/> the most deprived group. The measures are often used for routine data collection and for monitoring over<lb/> longer time periods. However, they ignore information on the large proportion of the population that falls<lb/> in between, in quintiles 2, 3 and 4.<lb/> 21.<lb/> A second group of more sophisticated regression-based measures summarise the magnitude of<lb/> inequalities across all population groups. These include summary indices such as the relative index of<lb/> inequality, and the concentration index, which is calculated in a similar fashion to the Lorenz curve and<lb/> Gini coefficient (<ref type="biblio">Wagstaff et al., 1991; Mackenbach &amp; Kunst, 1997; Schneider et al., 2004; Harper &amp;<lb/> Lynch, 2005</ref>). These measures include information on both the magnitude of inequality and the total<lb/> population distribution of inequality, but at the expense of ease of interpretation and with greater<lb/> restrictions on the types of data which can be used. They often require that socioeconomic status be<lb/> measured on a quantifiable scale, and this might prove problematic for education-and occupation-based<lb/> indicators.<lb/></p>

			<p>22.<lb/> An important consideration in choosing an appropriate measure of health inequality is the ease in<lb/> which they allow for routine data updating and ongoing monitoring. The choice of health inequality<lb/> measure is guided by restrictions imposed by available national or cross-national data, the requirements for<lb/> regular data provision and the assembling of a time series, the ease of interpretability and the resources<lb/> available for calculation of the indicator. Simpler measures such as rate ratios and rate differences would<lb/> be more feasible for a regular data collection such as the one carried out under OECD Health Data. In<lb/> using these simple measures, due care should be taken to present as much contextual information as<lb/> possible, such as providing both relative and absolute differences.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data sources and challenges to improve comparability<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> Data sources used to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in health should be nationally<lb/> representative, and must contain individual-level information which can be combined to form groups of<lb/> similar socioeconomic status. Data should contain measures of age, sex, SES and health status or health<lb/> care access and use. To ensure robust cross-national comparisons, each of these measures must be<lb/> collected in a standard fashion across all countries. Some common data sources that are used include vital<lb/> statistics collections such as mortality registries, censuses, population-based surveys and health or social<lb/> security records (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).<lb/> 24.<lb/> National mortality registries provide information on deaths by sex, age and cause, but in most<lb/> countries registries collect little or no information that can be used to determine socioeconomic status. This<lb/> means that data linkages need to be made between mortality registries and other comprehensive<lb/> information sources on the population (such as censuses), so as to be able to classify indicators of mortality<lb/> or life expectancy by some measure of socioeconomic status. In practice this only occurs in some<lb/> countries, and it is generally not undertaken for routine monitoring purposes.<lb/> 25.<lb/> National health sector information such as hospital admission records rarely include information<lb/> on income, education, occupation or other socioeconomic measures. If place of residence is collected, this<lb/> can be used to assign individuals to an area-based SES measure. Information derived from these sources<lb/> usually needs to be linked to another source which provides information on SES.<lb/> 26.<lb/> Health surveys are particularly well-suited to national-level analyses of inequalities in health<lb/> status (especially morbidity/disability) and in health care access and use. However, gathering comparable<lb/> data at an international level is limited by variations in the questions used to measure either health status,<lb/> or health care access and use, or socioeconomic status (see Annex 2). Limitations are also imposed by<lb/> differences in survey methodologies such as the reference population used and the mode of survey<lb/> administration. Further efforts to harmonise survey questions on health status, health care access and use,<lb/> and socioeconomic variables are required in order to improve the comparability of the data used to<lb/> measure socioeconomic inequalities in health.<lb/> 27.<lb/> In Europe, cross-national health interview surveys (or health modules in broader surveys) provide<lb/> information on self-assessed health and disability, as well as on health care use and unmet care needs based<lb/> on a common set of questions. These surveys include:<lb/></p>

			<head>• European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)</head>

			<p>– covers the entire adult<lb/> population aged 16 years and over in countries surveyed, except the population in institutions.<lb/> The survey contains questions that can be used to examine inequalities in four areas: self-rated<lb/> general health, chronic illnesses or conditions, activity limitation (disability) and unmet need for<lb/> medical or dental examination or treatment. Information is also collected on education and<lb/> income, allowing population stratification by SES. The survey is conducted annually. Data are<lb/> currently</p>

			<table>available for 15 European countries for the year 2004, and 27 countries for 2005 and<lb/> 2006. Data tables are available at the Eurostat website (www.epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu). 3<lb/> • European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) – Eurostat has developed a number of modules to<lb/> measure a wide variety of indicators of health status, health care use and socioeconomic status in<lb/> a harmonised way. European Union countries are being encouraged to periodically (once every<lb/> five years) implement these modules in their national surveys. About two-thirds of the 27 EU<lb/> countries have committed to implement the survey between 2006 and 2010. The EHIS holds<lb/> potential for future analysis of health inequalities by socioeconomic status. 4<lb/> • Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)</table>

			<p>– covers populations aged 50 and<lb/> over, excluding the population in institutions, and contains questions on physical health,<lb/> behavioural risks, cognitive function, mental health and health care, as well as on income,<lb/> education and occupation. Eleven countries contributed to the 2004 baseline study, with 15<lb/> participating in a second wave of data collection in 2006–07, and 16 due to participate in the third<lb/> wave in 2008–09. This survey is similar in many ways to the US Health and Retirement Survey<lb/> (HRS). Information is available at www.share-project.org.<lb/> 28.<lb/> Beyond Europe, one of the main cross-national surveys that has been used to collect information<lb/> on socioeconomic inequalities in health is the Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey.<lb/> This survey is conducted annually by the Commonwealth Fund, and it has been used to carry out similar<lb/> analyses among the non-European and European OECD countries covered – seven in 2007, including<lb/> Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Schoen et al., 2007</ref>). The survey contains questions on unmet health care needs and access problems, and<lb/> results from the 2001 and 2004 surveys were published with an analysis by respondent income<lb/> (www.commonwealthfund.org).</p>

			<head>The 2002–03 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health</head>

			<p>is another<lb/> survey that has been used to measure and compare socioeconomic disparities in health status, health care<lb/> use and unmet care needs between these two countries (<ref type="biblio">Sanmartin et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>4<lb/> The Eurostat website also contains data from national health interview surveys that were carried out between<lb/> 1999 and 2003 in most EU Member States and which were harmonised to the extents possible. The data<lb/> include survey results regarding questions on self-rated health, longstanding illness and disability (activity<lb/> restriction), health service use and preventative screening, stratified by educational level<lb/> (www.epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu).<lb/></figure>

			<head>1. INDICATORS OF INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH</head>

			<table>STATUS<lb/> 29.<lb/> Kunst and Mackenbach (1995) have defined socioeconomic inequalities in health status as<lb/> &quot; Differences in the prevalence or incidence of health problems between individual people<lb/> of higher or lower socioeconomic status &quot;<lb/></table>

				<formula>30.<lb/></formula>

			<p>In using this definition it should be emphasised that although individuals are referred to, analyses<lb/> of socioeconomic inequalities in health usually consider groups of individuals, linked by a common SES.<lb/> Within such a group, the individuals comprising it will differ in their health status; however taken as a<lb/> whole, people with lower SES tend to have higher morbidity and mortality rates.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.1 Mortality-based indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>31.<lb/> Indicators such as life expectancy, cause-specific and total mortality rates and infant mortality are<lb/> commonly used to monitor population health status. Data by sex and age are widely available and<lb/> relatively precise, but data linked to other measures of SES are scarcer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Life expectancy<lb/></head>

			<p>32.<lb/> Life expectancy is a measure of how long a person might expect to live if the mortality patterns<lb/> occurring in a particular year remained unchanged over a lifetime. Life expectancy measures the length of<lb/> life, but not its quality. The measures are derived from life tables, which are commonly calculated using<lb/> mortality data held in registries, although surveys and censuses may also be used. To calculate life<lb/> expectancies for different socioeconomic groups, mortality data for individuals must be &apos;linked&apos; to another<lb/> data set which includes information on the individuals&apos; SES, such as a census.<lb/> 33.<lb/> In 2006, Eurostat established a Task Force to develop indicators of life expectancy by socio-<lb/>economic status for EU countries. The Task Force&apos;s preferred approach is to link death certificates with<lb/> census information. The next census in 2011 provides an opportunity to put in place or refine the statistical<lb/> systems needed for the production of harmonised mortality data by socio-economic status. However, the<lb/> requirement for data linkage with census information means that this indicator might not be suited for<lb/> regular monitoring, since censuses are infrequent. But because life expectancies tend to increase slowly in<lb/> developed countries, except in certain circumstances, monitoring may only be necessary at 5-yearly<lb/> intervals or longer.<lb/> 34.<lb/> The available evidence shows that life expectancy is shorter among persons from lower<lb/> socioeconomic groups, reflecting group differences in the risk of dying. A number of studies have<lb/> observed differences in life expectancy at birth between lowest and highest socio-economic groups, in the<lb/> order of four to six years among men and two to four years among women, but larger differences may also<lb/> be observed (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach, 2006; Singh &amp; Siahpush, 2006; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2008;<lb/> Whitehouse &amp; Zaidi, 2008</ref>).<lb/> 35.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> provides an illustration of the link between socioeconomic inequality and life<lb/> expectancy. Men and women working in the least skilled occupations in England and Wales can expect to<lb/> live seven years less than persons working in professional occupations. The effect is observed not only<lb/> between the least and most skilled; the social gradient is evident across all levels of society, so that in this<lb/> example skilled workers have two to three years lower life expectancy than those in professional<lb/> occupations.<lb/></p>

Longitudinal data from household<lb/> panel surveys conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States indicate that average<lb/> total life expectancy for a 40-year-old low-income male (the lowest third of equivalised net household<lb/> incomes) is four to five years less than that of high income male (the highest third) (Whitehouse &amp; Zaidi,<lb/> 2008).<lb/> Figure 3: Income differences in male life expectancy at age 40 in Germany, the UK and the US<lb/> 37.7<lb/> 38.8<lb/> 38.4<lb/> 36.6<lb/> 37.4<lb/> 35.8<lb/> 33.6<lb/> 33.3<lb/> 34.7<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> 30<lb/> 35<lb/> 40<lb/> 45<lb/> 50<lb/> United States<lb/> United<lb/> Kingdom<lb/> Germany<lb/> Years<lb/> Low income<lb/> Middle income<lb/> High income<lb/> Sources: Whitehouse &amp; Zaidi, 2008; OECD unpublished.<lb/></figure>

			<p>37.<lb/> Analyses stratifying populations by education give the same picture (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The life<lb/> expectancy of better-educated men and women in the Russian Federation increased substantially between<lb/> 1980 and 2001, while it declined for the least-educated. In 1980, life expectancy at age 20 for university-<lb/>educated men was three years greater than for men with elementary education only; by 2001 this difference<lb/> had increased to 11 years. Similar patterns were seen in women (<ref type="biblio">Murphy et al., 2006</ref>). A widening in life<lb/> expectancy inequalities between those with lower and higher socioeconomic status scores has also been<lb/> observed in Finland around this time, with differences in deaths from cardiovascular diseases and alcohol-<lb/>related conditions together accounting for most of the increase in health inequalities in that country<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 38.<lb/> The monitoring of socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy is part of a Programme for<lb/> Action for the national health inequalities strategy in England (Department of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2008</ref>). A target for<lb/> life expectancy has been set: by 2010 to reduce the gap between the fifth of areas with the worst health and<lb/> deprivation indicators and the population as a whole, by at least 10%.<lb/></p>

			<head>Total mortality<lb/></head>

			<p>39.<lb/> Important differences in mortality rates are found between different socioeconomic groups. Rates<lb/> of mortality are higher among persons with lower levels of education or income, or in lower occupational<lb/> classes, and these differential rates are evident for most major causes of death. These inequalities in<lb/> mortality exist across all age groups and both sexes, although they tend to be smaller among women than<lb/> men (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 40.<lb/> Vital statistics registries are the starting point for examining socioeconomic inequalities in<lb/> mortality. Information on income, education or occupation is needed to stratify populations by SES, and<lb/> this is usually obtained through linking mortality records to a census or other survey. In some countries,<lb/> relevant information such as the usual occupation of the deceased is collected following death, and is<lb/> included on death certificates. This information can be used to stratify populations by SES, if available<lb/> electronically.<lb/> 41.<lb/> Measuring SES using levels of income, education or occupation is not straightforward, and due<lb/> care needs to be taken in ensuring that cross-national comparisons are valid through comparing similar<lb/> categories. The requirement for data linkage to censuses or other surveys adds difficulty to using this<lb/> indicator for routine monitoring purposes, since censuses are infrequent.<lb/> 42.<lb/> Data on total mortality rate ratios by education, income and occupation are available for most<lb/> OECD countries, albeit on an irregular basis (see, for example, <ref type="biblio">Mackenbach et al., 2008; Fukuda et al.,<lb/> 2007; Khang et al., 2004</ref>). Long time series of mortality data with socioeconomic information covering<lb/> large national samples are only available for a limited number of countries.<lb/> 43.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> presents information on deaths among mostly middle-aged men and women in a number<lb/> of European countries. Mortality data were linked to censuses carried out during the early-to-mid 1990s in<lb/> order to obtain information on the highest level of completed education. Age-standardised death rates and<lb/> rate ratios were calculated for educational groups, with a rate ratio of 1.0 indicating no difference between<lb/> lower and higher educated persons. Mortality rates among less educated persons are markedly higher. In<lb/> European countries, less educated persons have a 20–50% excess risk of dying than more educated<lb/> persons, and in some countries mortality rates are more than double. Inequalities are larger for men, except<lb/> in Spain (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>44.<lb/> A further example from Korea shows inequalities in mortality among men, according to their<lb/> highest level of completed education (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Men with the least education had mortality rates four to<lb/> five times higher the most educated group. Although mortality rates fell for all groups over the ten-year<lb/> period 1990–1991 to 2000–2001, the relative level of socioeconomic inequality in mortality appeared to be<lb/> unchanged (<ref type="biblio">Khang et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

All<lb/> OECD countries have seen remarkable progress in reducing infant mortality in recent decades, with an<lb/> average reduction of 80% across the 30 countries between 1970 and 2005 (OECD, 2007a). Yet widespread<lb/> inequalities in infant mortality rates persist within countries. Figure 7 provides an illustration, and shows<lb/> infant mortality rates for urban neighbourhoods in Canada by quintiles of wealth. Rates declined rapidly<lb/> for all neighbourhoods between 1971 and 1996, although they remain highest among the poorest<lb/> neighbourhoods. Inequalities narrowed somewhat over the time period, in that the rate ratio of the richest<lb/> and poorest neighbourhoods (Q1/Q5) declined from 2.0 in 1971 to 1.7 in 1996, although progress slowed<lb/> after 1991.<lb/> Figure 7: Infant mortality rates by quintiles of wealth, Canada, 1971–1996<lb/> 0<lb/> 4<lb/> 8<lb/> 12<lb/> 16<lb/> 20<lb/> 1971<lb/> 1976<lb/> 1981<lb/> 1986<lb/> 1991<lb/> 1996<lb/> Year<lb/> Q1–Richest<lb/> Q2<lb/> Q3<lb/> Q4<lb/> Q5–Poorest<lb/> Per 1,000<lb/></figure>

			<p>Sources: <ref type="biblio">Wilkins &amp; Houle, 1999; Wilkins, 2003<lb/></ref> 46.<lb/> A similar study examined trends in infant mortality in the United States between 1960 and 2002,<lb/> by county median family income (<ref type="biblio">Krieger et al., 2008</ref>). Infant mortality declined in all county income<lb/> quintiles, and both absolute and relative inequalities shrank between 1966 and 1980; relative health<lb/> inequalities widened thereafter, with little change in the magnitude of absolute differences.<lb/> 47.<lb/> A number of countries use infant mortality to monitor health inequality targets. The United<lb/> Kingdom Department of Health target is to reduce the gap in infant mortality in England and Wales<lb/> between the &apos;routine and manual&apos; occupation group and the population as a whole to 10% by 2010<lb/> (Department of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2007</ref>). The infant mortality rate among the routine and manual group was 17%<lb/> higher than the total population in 2004–06, compared with 19% higher in 2002–04, and 13% higher in the<lb/> baseline year 1997–99. While the gap has decreased in recent years, further progress will be needed to<lb/> reach the 10% target by 2010.<lb/> 48.<lb/> The same data sources used for the analysis of total or cause-specific mortality allow for the<lb/> examination of socioeconomic inequalities among particular age groups, including infants. The need for<lb/> age-standardisation of data is avoided, but the challenge of linking data sources containing information on<lb/> mortality and SES remains. Determining the SES of an infant is usually through ascertaining the status of a<lb/> parent, or of the geographic area of residence of the household.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2 Morbidity-based indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>49.<lb/> Other measures beyond those based on mortality are required for monitoring inequalities in<lb/> population health status. As life expectancy increases and chronic disease prevalence continues to rise,<lb/> policy makers need additional information on the non-fatal consequences of disease and severity of health<lb/> conditions. A number of morbidity-based indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health are available,<lb/> generally utilising information on self-reported health, illness or activity limitation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Self-reported health<lb/></head>

			<p>50.<lb/> Questions on self-reported health form part of most national and cross-national health surveys,<lb/> and can be used to gauge levels and distributions in population health status. These surveys include a<lb/> question of the form: &quot; How is your health status in general? Very good, good, fair, bad or very bad &quot; .<lb/> Although subjective in nature, within particular national cultures the measure correlates well with other<lb/> measures of health status, and it has been found to be useful in predicting future health problems and health<lb/> service use (<ref type="biblio">Miilunpalo et al., 1997</ref>). This question, or more elaborate sets of questions on self-reported<lb/> health, can also be used in the calculation of healthy life expectancies and other summary measures of<lb/> health (see next section). It remains one of the most widely available indicators of health inequalities by<lb/> SES.<lb/> 51.<lb/> The main sources of information on self-reported health are national, or cross-national health<lb/> interview surveys. In European countries, both EU-SILC and EHIS collect information on self-reported<lb/> health, and the available data allow a stratification of the population either by income or education. In<lb/> order to promote valid international comparisons, the methods and instruments – including the survey<lb/> questions, response categories and the populations surveyed – must be standard (see Annex 2). For the<lb/> purpose of measuring disparities in each country, populations within countries must also share common<lb/> cultural standards and perceptions of good health. For these reasons, caution is required when making<lb/> cross-country comparisons using this indicator. A number of cross-national studies of self-reported health<lb/> by SES are available (<ref type="biblio">Sanmartin et al., 2004; NOMESCO, 2004; Mackenbach, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>52.<lb/> When self-reported health is analysed by SES groupings, important differentials in population<lb/> health status are revealed. Among Nordic countries, for example, a series of national surveys conducted in<lb/> 2000–2002 found that greater proportions of persons with low education report poorer health, and more so<lb/> in Finland than Sweden, Norway or Denmark (Figure 8). Women tended to report poorer health than men,<lb/> except in Finland.<lb/> Figure 8: Percentage of people reporting poor health, by education and gender, Nordic countries, 2000–2002<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> 30<lb/> 35<lb/> DNK SWE FIN NOR<lb/> DNK SWE FIN NOR<lb/> DNK SWE FIN NOR<lb/> A maximum of 9 years education<lb/> 10–12 years education<lb/> At least 13 years education<lb/> % reporting poor<lb/> health<lb/> Men Women<lb/> Source: NOMESCO, 2004<lb/></figure>

			<p>53.<lb/> These findings are repeated in many countries – people in lower socioeconomic groups report<lb/> poorer health. But the extent of inequality varies from country to country, with differing rates of inequality<lb/> between income groups reporting &apos;very bad&apos; or &apos;bad&apos; health, for example (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Within EU countries,<lb/> reported poor health among the population as a whole is most prevalent in Eastern European countries<lb/> (Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Poland), along with Portugal and Spain; however, as<lb/> previously discussed, different populations do not always share common standards and perceptions of good<lb/> health. Inequalities within countries between low and high income groups are greater in Belgium, Iceland,<lb/> Ireland and the United Kingdom, although in the latter three countries, the proportion of persons reporting<lb/> poorer health is low.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9: Inequalities in persons reporting their health as &apos;very bad&apos;, by income quintile and rate ratio, selected<lb/> EU countries, 2006<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> Ireland<lb/> Netherlands<lb/> Iceland<lb/> Sweden<lb/> United Kingdom<lb/> Luxembourg<lb/> Denmark<lb/> Austria<lb/> Greece<lb/> Italy<lb/> France<lb/> Germany<lb/> Norway<lb/> Belgium<lb/> Finland<lb/> Poland<lb/> Spain<lb/> Czech Republic<lb/> Slovak Republic<lb/> Hungary<lb/> Portugal<lb/> Per cent<lb/> Lowest income quintile<lb/> Highest income quintile<lb/> 0.0<lb/> 5.0<lb/> 10.0<lb/> 15.0<lb/> Rate ratio<lb/> Source: EU-SILC<lb/></figure>

			<p>54.<lb/> The situation is no different in non-European countries, with numerous studies confirming poorer<lb/> self-rated health among persons from lower socioeconomic groups. There are differences, however, in the<lb/> specific measure of SES used in the published data that are readily available, with some countries such as<lb/> Australia and New Zealand using a Disadvantage or Deprivation Index, while other countries use<lb/> education or income levels (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Such differences hamper cross-country comparisons with data<lb/> derived from EU-SILC.<lb/> 55.<lb/> Inequalities in self-reported morbidity are substantial, and persons with lower socio-economic<lb/> status have higher morbidity rates not only in self-reported health, but also in chronic conditions and<lb/> disability.

			<head>Self-reported disability<lb/></head>

			<p>56.<lb/> Monitoring disability is important in the light of population ageing and increasing rates of<lb/> chronic disease. Self-reported disability reflects the non-fatal consequences of disease and impairment, and<lb/> can provide some indication of the need for medical and social services. Information on self-reported<lb/> disability may also be used to calculate various measures of healthy life expectancy (see next section).<lb/> 57.<lb/> Progress towards a universal concept and definition of disability was assisted by the adoption of<lb/> the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by the World Health<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Organization in 2001 (WHO, 2001</ref>). The ICF uses the term &apos;disability&apos; to broadly cover any or all of the<lb/> following components: impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction, as influenced by<lb/> environmental factors 5 . A number of cross-national initiatives (notably the Budapest Initiative on Health<lb/> Status Measures, and the UN Washington City Group on Disability Statistics) have in recent years sought<lb/> to develop a small set of standard questions on health status and disability that could be recommended for<lb/> use in (cross-) national surveys or censuses.<lb/> 58.<lb/> Currently, measures of self-reported disability are available for most OECD countries, although<lb/> the survey instruments vary across countries, thereby limiting comparability (see Annex 2). In Europe, the<lb/> EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) includes one general question on<lb/> disability. The health status module in the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) also recommends that<lb/> EU countries use this question, along with a more elaborate set of questions, to measure different types of<lb/> disabilities. Other countries include questions on disability in general health or specialised surveys,<lb/> 5<lb/></p>

			<p>Impairments are &quot; problems in body function or structure such as significant deviation or loss &quot; . Activity<lb/> limitations are &quot; difficulties an individual may have in executing activities &quot; . Participation restrictions are<lb/> &quot; problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations &quot; . Environmental factors &quot; make up<lb/> the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives &quot; (<ref type="biblio">WHO, 2001</ref>).<lb/> although the question might measure a different type of disability. Additional demographic and other<lb/> information collected in these surveys allow for stratification of respondents by SES groups.<lb/> 59.<lb/> Disability rates tend to be higher among socioeconomically disadvantaged persons. Results from<lb/> the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2003 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, for example,<lb/> indicate that self-reported disability is three to four times more prevalent in the lowest income quintile,<lb/> compared with the highest income quintile (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). This finding is related to people in lower<lb/> socioeconomic groups having higher frequencies of physical and mental health problems.<lb/></p>

			<p>60.<lb/> A large body of evidence reports that higher educational levels are associated with lower levels<lb/> of disability (<ref type="biblio">Mackenbach, 2006; Lafortune et al., 2007</ref>). Higher educational levels are often accompanied<lb/> by higher incomes and standards of living, a lower risk of work-related injury or ill-health, and healthier<lb/> behaviours such as a balanced diet and a lower prevalence of smoking and risk alcohol drinking. Across 19<lb/> OECD countries in the late 1990s, the average disability prevalence rate among groups with lower<lb/> educational attainment was 19%, compared with 11% among the better educated (OECD, 2003). 6<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3 Summary measures of population health<lb/></head>

			<p>61.<lb/> Increasingly, a variety of health information is needed to complement conventional measures of<lb/> life expectancy, and to determine whether ageing populations are living longer lives free of disability or ill<lb/> health. Summary measures of population health assist in this by combining information on both mortality<lb/> and morbidity, so as to better monitor population health and forecast future health care needs. These<lb/> measures provide information on the number of remaining years a person might expect to live, and on their<lb/> health status during those years.<lb/> 62.<lb/> Several measures have been developed, each seeking to calculate the average expectation of<lb/> years of life in equivalent good health, after adjusting for years lived with some form of illness or<lb/> disability. Summary measures of population health include Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE),<lb/> Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). These measures<lb/> may also be calculated for different socioeconomic groups within a population.<lb/> 63.<lb/> The measures are relatively easy to interpret, being based on recognisable concepts of illness,<lb/> disability and mortality. Their calculation is more complex, since they rely on at least two data sources – a<lb/> measure of morbidity or disability, usually a health or household interview survey, and a measure of<lb/> mortality, often a census cohort linked to a mortality registry. One of these sources must also contain<lb/> information on socioeconomic status, if summary measures by SES group are to be calculated.<lb/> 64.<lb/> Regular monitoring of summary measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health within<lb/> countries is still uncommon. Cross-national comparisons of summary measures are further complicated by<lb/> needing to ensure that the concepts and methods used in data sources are standard across countries. In<lb/> recent years, international organisations such as Eurostat and the World Health Organization have made<lb/> efforts to improve understandings and applications of concepts and methods, and to harmonise summary<lb/> measures of population health, although it remains a challenge to disaggregate them by SES.<lb/></p>

			<head>Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE)<lb/></head>

			<p>65.<lb/> The Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) measure aims to quantify the remaining years a<lb/> person of a certain age can expect to live without disability. The measure requires mortality data as for a<lb/> standard life table, and estimates of the prevalence of disability among population age groups, usually as<lb/> self-reported in health surveys. The valuation of self-reported disability status is based on a simple<lb/> dichotomous value of 0 (if people report being moderately or severely disabled, depending on the cut-off<lb/> point) or 1 (if they report not being disabled). To calculate DFLE by SES, one of the data sources must<lb/> also contain information on income, education or occupation.<lb/> 66.<lb/> DFLE has been adopted as a European Structural Indicator, and it is calculated and reported by<lb/> Eurostat on a regular basis, using the EU-SILC as the source for the disability measure 7 . Work continues to<lb/> develop the measure, with DG-SANCO and Eurostat establishing an EU Task Force on Health<lb/> Expectancies in 2006. The strategic plan of the Task Force includes improving current Healthy Life Year<lb/> (i.e. DFLE) estimates, improving international comparability, and calculating Healthy Life Years for SES<lb/> groups (EU Task Force on Health <ref type="biblio">Expectancies, 2007</ref>). This latter goal depends crucially, however, on<lb/> achieving progress in calculating life expectancy by SES in a consistent way in EU countries.<lb/> 67.<lb/> A number of non-European countries have also calculated DFLE, using self-reported disability<lb/> questions from their own national health or disability surveys. The US National Centre for Health Statistics<lb/> currently uses three measures of Years of Healthy Life, including DFLE, to monitor the US &apos;Healthy<lb/> People 2010&apos; public health programme. Questions and response categories often differ across countries and<lb/> surveys, and these will require standardisation if they are to be used for cross-national comparison. For<lb/> instance, the question on disability used by the US National Center for Health Statistics (taken from the<lb/> National Health Interview Survey) includes only two response categories (Yes, limited in activities or No,<lb/> not limited), while the disability question in EU SILC includes three responses (Yes, severely limited; Yes,<lb/> limited but not severely; No, not limited). There are also differences in the wording of the question. These<lb/> differences can be expected to affect the comparability of overall prevalence rates of disability in the<lb/> population, however, they probably have less impact if the focus is on examining the distribution of<lb/> disability by SES within each country.<lb/></p>

			<figure>7<lb/> In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council invited the European Commission to present an annual report on<lb/> progress achieved in the areas of employment, innovation, economic reform, social cohesion and the<lb/> environment. &apos;Structural Indicators&apos; allows quantitative evaluation and comparison of performances of the<lb/> Member States in these areas. The DFLE Structural Indicator is also known as &apos;Healthy Life Years&apos;.<lb/> 68.<lb/> The example in Figure 10 shows life expectancy for females with and without disability in<lb/> England, as derived from the annual Health Survey for England. SES was measured by calculating material<lb/> deprivation deciles, based on area of residence information from the 1991 Census. Females born during<lb/> 1996–1999 could expect to live 60 years free of disability on average, but with wide variation, from 55<lb/> years in most deprived areas to 65 years in least deprived areas.<lb/> Figure 10: LE and DFLE at birth by deprivation deciles, females, England, 1996–1999<lb/> 65<lb/> 63<lb/> 64<lb/> 62<lb/> 61<lb/> 59<lb/> 59<lb/> 58<lb/> 57<lb/> 55<lb/> 17<lb/> 18<lb/> 17<lb/> 19<lb/> 19<lb/> 21<lb/> 21<lb/> 21<lb/> 22<lb/> 24<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 70<lb/> 80<lb/> 90<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> 8<lb/> 9<lb/> 1 0<lb/> Least d ep rived<lb/> Mo st d ep rived<lb/> Years of life<lb/> Deciles<lb/> Disability-free<lb/> With disability<lb/> Source: Bajekal, 2005<lb/> Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE)<lb/> 69.<lb/> Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) measures the number of years that an individual can<lb/> expect to live in full health if current morbidity and mortality conditions prevail. It &apos;adjusts&apos; life<lb/> expectancy by weighing years of life lived in good health higher than years lived in poor health. The<lb/> weighing of years of life depends on the valuation of different health conditions, with values ranging from<lb/> 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents full health.<lb/> 70.<lb/> Information required to calculate HALE includes a life table in order to calculate life<lb/> expectancies, a population health survey which describes the health status of the population, and a<lb/> valuation of the different health conditions. HALE may be calculated for socioeconomic groups if both life<lb/> expectancy and health status measures can be linked to the same SES measure. Valid cross-country<lb/> comparisons are also subject to the same constraint.<lb/> 71.<lb/> HALE has been calculated for the 2001 Canadian population (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>), using the Health Utility<lb/> Index to describe and value health status. In this example, life expectancy at birth and at age 65 are<lb/> presented for both males and females in different income groups. Both sexes in lower income groups can<lb/> expect to live less years in full health. At birth, Canadian males in the lowest income group had a HALE<lb/> almost five years lower than that for males in the highest income group; among females, HALE was three<lb/> years lower (<ref type="biblio">Health Canada, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> A third summary health measure, the Disability Adjusted Life Year, or DALY, is also used to<lb/> examine socioeconomic inequalities in health. The DALY is a &apos;health gap&apos; measure that extends the<lb/> concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) to include equivalent years of &apos;healthy&apos;<lb/> life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability (YLD). DALYs thus represent the sum of<lb/> YLL and YLD, with one DALY representing the loss of one year of equivalent full health (<ref type="biblio">Murray et al.,<lb/> 2002</ref>).<lb/> 73.<lb/> The calculation of DALYs requires a number of data sources. The YLL component is derived<lb/> from information on numbers of deaths, and life expectancies at various ages, as sourced from life tables<lb/> and mortality registers. The YLD component requires data on disease incidence and duration until<lb/> remission or death, as well as a weight factor reflecting disease severity on a scale from 0 (perfect health)<lb/> to 1 (death). It can be derived from various sources, including disease registers, hospital administrative<lb/> data or health interview surveys.<lb/> 74.<lb/> DALYs have been used as summary measures of population health by the World Health<lb/> Organization in their Global Burden of Disease Study and World Health Reports (<ref type="biblio">Lopez et al., 2006</ref>),<lb/> although data were not disaggregated by SES groups. Several countries have produced their own Burden of<lb/> Disease reports, using DALYs to monitor health inequalities (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Begg et al., 2007</ref> for Australia).<lb/> 75.<lb/> DALYs have been calculated for the Australian population by SES, using 2003 mortality and<lb/> morbidity/disability data. Not surprisingly, populations in areas with lower SES experienced proportionally<lb/> higher burdens of disease in terms of disability and mortality than populations in areas with higher SES<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). The difference exceeded 30% between the most and least disadvantaged populations (<ref type="biblio">Begg et<lb/> al., 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2. INDICATORS OF INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND USE<lb/></head>

			<p>76.<lb/> Ensuring adequate access to essential health services on the basis of individual need is a health<lb/> policy goal in all OECD countries. Most countries further endorse the principle of &apos;equal access to equal<lb/> care for equal need&apos;. Almost all OECD countries have introduced universal health insurance coverage to<lb/> ensure financial access to a core set of health services (OECD, 2007a). Despite this, inequalities in health<lb/> care access and use remain for different reasons, and these may act to either mitigate or exacerbate<lb/> inequalities in health status.<lb/> 77.<lb/> Health care access means people&apos;s ability to obtain appropriate health care services in a timely<lb/> fashion and without obstacle. Some common barriers to access include financial reasons, a lack of health<lb/> care providers, excessive travelling distance to providers, and excessive waiting time to see providers.<lb/> Health care use relates to people&apos;s actual utilisation of different types of services (<ref type="biblio">Academy Health, 2004</ref>).<lb/> In determining inequities in health service utilisation, an adjustment to actual utilisation rates is often<lb/> needed in order to compensate for people&apos;s differing needs for care, using available information such as<lb/> their self assessed health status.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Measurement of inequalities in access and use may simply be in terms of comparing rates of<lb/> unmet care or rates of service utilisation between low and high income groups. It may also be measured<lb/> using more complex indices that seek to account for differences across the whole population, and not just<lb/> between highest and lowest socioeconomic groups.<lb/> 79.<lb/> Indicators that are commonly used to gauge equity in health care access and use include the<lb/> extent of public and private health insurance coverage across SES groups, the receipt or use of different<lb/> types of health services (ideally adjusted for need, where applicable), the reporting of unmet care needs for<lb/> various reasons, and the proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure in relation to household income or<lb/> consumption. A discussion of each of these follows.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Health insurance coverage<lb/></head>

			<p>80.<lb/> One potential barrier to receiving appropriate health care is inadequate insurance coverage.<lb/> Health insurance coverage provides financial security against the costs of unexpected illness and assists<lb/> access to innovative treatments and preventative services. Most OECD countries have achieved universal<lb/> coverage of health care costs for at least a core set of services, sometimes through combinations of public<lb/> and private health insurance. Three countries that have not yet attained universal coverage are Mexico,<lb/> Turkey and the United States (OECD, 2007a) (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>81.<lb/> Data from the US National Health Interview Survey indicate that about 30% of persons aged less<lb/> than 65 years who are deemed poor or near-poor do not have health insurance (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>), compared to<lb/> 10–15% of middle income and 5% of high income persons. The uninsured are more likely to have poorer<lb/> health status and die early. They report more problems in getting care, are diagnosed at later disease stages<lb/> and receive less therapeutic care. The uninsured are sicker when hospitalised and are more likely to die<lb/> during their hospital stay. In the United States, the problem of persistent uninsurance is seen as a major<lb/> barrier to receiving health care, and, more broadly, to reducing health inequalities (AHRQ, 2008).<lb/></p>

			<p>82.<lb/> Total population insurance coverage is imperfect in indicating health care accessibility, since the<lb/> package of health goods and services included and the cost-sharing arrangements may vary from country to<lb/> country, as well as within countries (OECD, 2007a). It is important to look at basic health insurance<lb/> coverage in conjunction with other types of private health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket spending<lb/> for health services (see next section on this latter topic).<lb/> 83.<lb/> Private health insurance plays a number of roles in OECD health systems, either as a primary or<lb/> supplementary source of insurance coverage. Complementary or duplicate coverage is also possible<lb/> (OECD, 2004c). In a number of countries, private health insurance coverage varies by SES. In Australia,<lb/> 23% of persons in the lowest income quintile in 2004–05 had private health insurance, compared with 76%<lb/> of those in the highest income quintile (ABS, 2006). In France, coverage of complementary health<lb/> insurance is unequal across income groups, and poorer households spend proportionally more of their<lb/> incomes to purchase it (10.3% of income in the lowest income quintile vs. 2.9% in the highest) (<ref type="biblio">Kambia-<lb/>Chopin et al., 2008</ref>). Private health insurance need not necessarily create access inequities, however,<lb/> especially if voluntary schemes complement what are otherwise fairly equitable distributions of care<lb/> (OECD, 2004b).<lb/> 84.<lb/> OECD Health Data already collects data on public and private health insurance coverage,<lb/> although not disaggregated by income group. In countries that do not have universal health insurance<lb/> coverage, data on public and/or private health insurance coverage by SES may be collected through health<lb/> interview or household surveys.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Out-of-pocket expenditure<lb/></head>

			<p>85.<lb/> Measuring the financial burden of out-of-pocket spending on households is important, since these<lb/> burdens can create barriers to health care access and/or use. Households having difficulties paying medical<lb/> bills may delay or forgo needed health care (<ref type="biblio">Hoffman et al., 2005; May &amp; Cunningham, 2004, cited in<lb/> Banthin et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/> 86.<lb/> In contrast to publicly-funded care, out-of-pocket payments are distributed based on the use of<lb/> care, and not on the ability to pay. If the financing of health care becomes more dependent on out-of-<lb/>pocket payments, its burden is, in theory, shifted towards those who use the services more (possibly from<lb/> rich to poor, if health care needs are higher for the low income groups). In practice, many countries have<lb/> put in place exemptions and caps to out-of-pocket payments for lower income groups to protect health care<lb/> access.<lb/> 87.<lb/> The burden of out-of-pocket health spending on households can be measured either by its share<lb/> of total household income or its share of total household consumption. Data presently collected under<lb/> OECD Health Data show that the average share of out-of-pocket spending in household consumption<lb/> varies considerably across OECD countries in 2006, representing less than 2% of total household<lb/> consumption in countries such as the Netherlands and France, while such spending accounted for more<lb/> than 6% of total household consumption in Switzerland and Greece. The United States, with almost 3% of<lb/> consumption being spent on out-of-pocket health services, is close to the average.<lb/> 88.<lb/> The distribution of spending across the population can vary considerably, depending on whether<lb/> such spending is affected by income, service use, type of coverage, or other factors. For instance, an<lb/> analysis of data from the US Medical Expenditure Survey found that 28% of Americans living in a poor<lb/> family (defined as a family income below the federal poverty level) were spending more than 10% of their<lb/> after-tax family income for health services and health insurance premiums in 2004, compared with 10% of<lb/> Americans living in a high income family (<ref type="biblio">Banthin et al., 2008</ref>). 8<lb/> 89.<lb/> A 2007 Commonwealth Fund survey found that – in addition to almost 50 million people who<lb/> were uninsured in the US – an estimated 25 million people aged 19–64 (or 14% of all adults) were<lb/> underinsured, a 60% increase since 2003. Persons were defined as &apos;underinsured&apos; if they experienced at<lb/> least one of the three indicators of financial expenditure exposure relative to income: (1) out-of-pocket<lb/> medical expenses for care amounted to 10% of income or more, (ii) among low-income adults (below<lb/> 200% of the federal poverty level), medical expenses amounted to at least 5% of income, or<lb/> (iii) deductibles equalled or exceeded 5% of income. Underinsurance varied by SES group, from 7% of<lb/> adults earning USD 100 000 or more, to 26% of adults earning less than USD 20 000 per annum. In total,<lb/> 42% of US adults were found to be underinsured or uninsured, reporting high levels of access problems<lb/> and financial stress (<ref type="biblio">Schoen et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/> 90.<lb/> A small proportion of households in OECD countries face &quot; catastrophic &quot; health expenditure each<lb/> year, often defined as payments for health services exceeding 40% of their disposable income after<lb/> subsistence needs are met. In Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United States, rates of catastrophic<lb/> spending exceed 0.5% (<ref type="biblio">Xu et al., 2007</ref>). The incidence of financial catastrophe in the lowest income<lb/> quintile would be expected to exceed that in higher quintiles; however the imposition of user fees may<lb/> mean that households in lower income quintiles do not use enough services to incur catastrophic<lb/> expenditures.<lb/> 91.<lb/> Information on the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in total household income or consumption<lb/> disaggregated by income group is collected through regular household expenditure surveys in a number of<lb/> OECD countries. Some further developmental work would be needed to obtain comparable data on this<lb/> type of measure across countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Health care utilisation<lb/></head>

			<p>92.<lb/> Socioeconomic status is an important factor in determining how populations utilise health care<lb/> services. Income, education and occupational status affect health care need, recognition and response to<lb/> health symptoms, knowledge of disease, and access and choice of health services. Although people in<lb/> lower socioeconomic groups tend to have higher rates of disease and mortality, they do not necessarily<lb/> utilise health care at greater rates.<lb/> 93.<lb/> After adjusting for differences in the need for health care, the use of primary health care is<lb/> generally found to be equitable or fairly distributed, but research has found a &apos;pro-rich&apos; bias in the use of<lb/> specialist and dental care, as well as in the use of preventative services such as breast and cervical cancer<lb/> screening (<ref type="biblio">Van Doorslaer &amp; Masseria in OECD, 2004b; Mielck et al. in Mackenbach &amp; EUROTHINE,<lb/> 2007; WHO, 2008; Gakidou, 2008</ref>).<lb/> 94.<lb/> Van <ref type="biblio">Doorslaer &amp; Masseria (OECD, 2004b</ref>) used a sophisticated measure, the concentration<lb/> index, to measure income-related inequality in the use of various types of medical care in OECD countries.<lb/> The study aimed at comparing the actual distribution of medical and dental care by income, adjusted by<lb/> need. Survey data were sourced from the European Community Household Panel conducted in 2000 by<lb/> Eurostat, as well as from national health surveys in non-EU countries. Results for specialist visits are<lb/> shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>. Even after health service need was accounted for, higher income persons in all<lb/> surveyed countries – except the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway – were more intensive users<lb/> of specialist visits than lower income groups. This was especially so for Portugal, Finland, Ireland and<lb/> Italy, four countries where private insurance and direct private payments play a role in accessing specialist<lb/> services. More recent research has also found that, after controlling for need, people with higher education<lb/> levels in nine European countries tend to use specialist care more than less-educated people (<ref type="biblio">Or et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Unmet care needs<lb/></head>

			<p>98.<lb/> An additional measure of health care access is whether people report an unmet care need for<lb/> some reason, whether a doctor visit, a dental consultation, a hospital admission or another type of care. In<lb/> order to determine unmet care, individuals are typically asked health interview questions of the nature:<lb/> &quot; Was there a time in the previous 12 months that you felt you needed health care services but did not<lb/> receive them? &quot; , followed by a question to determine why the need for care was unmet. Such questions are<lb/> a feature of a number of national and cross-national health interview surveys, including EU-SILC, the<lb/> recommended health care module in EHIS, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe<lb/> (SHARE), the international health policy surveys conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, and the Joint<lb/> Canada/United States Survey of Health.<lb/> 99.<lb/> Research indicates that unmet care needs are experienced mostly by people with low SES,<lb/> whether through low income, lack of insurance coverage, or because they come from a racial or ethnic<lb/> minority group. Common reasons given for care needs not being met include excessive costs of care,<lb/> excessive waiting times to receive care, or having to travel too far to receive care (<ref type="biblio">Sanmartin et al., 2004;<lb/> Mielck et al., in Mackenbach &amp; EUROTHINE, 2007</ref>).<lb/> 100.<lb/> The International Health Policy surveys regularly conducted by the Commonwealth Fund report<lb/> on unmet care among a number of non-European countries, as well as in Germany, the Netherlands and the<lb/> United Kingdom (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). The 2007 survey found that foregone care for a number of different<lb/> treatments due to costs remains more prevalent among lower income groups, although the level is much<lb/> lower in the United Kingdom than in the United States. In the United States, adults with below-average<lb/> incomes who have health insurance report significantly fewer access problems due to cost than their<lb/> uninsured counterparts (<ref type="biblio">Blendon et al., 2002</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>101.<lb/> The EU-SILC collects data on unmet medical and dental care needs in a majority of OECD<lb/> countries. In Europe, higher rates of unmet need for medical examinations among the adult population<lb/> were reported in Poland (9.3%), Greece (5.8%) and Portugal (5.0%) in 2006 (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). But inequalities<lb/> within countries were greater in countries such as Belgium, Portugal and the Slovak Republic, although in<lb/> Belgium the overall reported level of unmet care is low (less than 1%).<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>104.<lb/> This paper has surveyed indicators that might be used to measure socioeconomic inequalities in<lb/> health status, and in health care access and use.<lb/> 105.<lb/> Based on the criteria of policy relevancy, interpretability and data availability across countries, a<lb/> number of potential indicators are suggested, along with an indication of how frequently these indicators<lb/> might be collected. To allow broad comparisons across OECD countries, improvements in data availability<lb/> and comparability would need to be made for many of the suggested indicators. Regarding mortality-based<lb/> measures, the main challenge for countries is to link data from mortality registers to a measure of<lb/> socioeconomic status (SES). For the purpose of international comparison, the same measure of SES (be it<lb/> income, education or occupation) would need to be used in all countries. Regarding morbidity-based<lb/> measures, the main challenge is to further harmonise a key set of questions in national health survey<lb/> modules on health status and health care use, and to be able to link this information with a standard<lb/> measure of SES. This is currently being done in Europe through the development of the European Health<lb/> Interview Survey. Comparisons might also be broadened by expanding the country coverage in multi-<lb/>country surveys, such as those conducted by the Commonwealth Fund.<lb/> 106.<lb/> Survey-based measures of health status and of health care access and use might be subject to a<lb/> number of potential limitations, such as cultural biases, recall biases, different coverage of the population<lb/> (e.g., inclusion or exclusion of the population in institutions), and issues related to the representativeness of<lb/> the survey sample. Nonetheless, health-related surveys remain a unique source of data in most countries to<lb/> measure socioeconomic inequalities in health status and health care access and use. While cultural factors<lb/> might affect responses to survey questions that are more subjective in terms of the average level across<lb/> countries, they are likely to have a lesser impact if the focus of the analysis is on disparities across<lb/> socioeconomic groups within each country (assuming that the different socioeconomic groups in each<lb/> country share common cultural characteristics).<lb/> 107.<lb/> The indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health and health care access judged at this stage<lb/> to be feasible for regular (i.e. annual or biennial) collection include: self-rated health, self-rated disability,<lb/> and measures of unmet care needs. Indicators that are judged feasible to collect for a reasonable number of<lb/> countries, but which are more suited to periodic collection (i.e. every three to five years) include: life<lb/> expectancy, total mortality rate, infant mortality rate, the proportion of the population who do not have any<lb/> health care coverage (for the few countries where this may be relevant), measures of health care use<lb/> (adjusted where appropriate for need), and the share of out-of-</p>

			<figure>pocket expenditure. Collection of the<lb/> different indicators of healthy life expectancy (disability-free life expectancy, health adjusted life<lb/> expectancy, and disability adjusted life years) is less feasible, given the current state of data development.<lb/> 108.<lb/> The examples discussed in this paper help underline some of the issues involved in making valid<lb/> multi-country comparisons of health inequality, not the least of which are harmonisation of definitions and<lb/> measurement instruments, and the need for data linkages in order to allow disaggregation by SES. The<lb/> effort made to improve data availability and comparability will determine whether health inequalities can<lb/> be regularly monitored across most or all OECD Countries.<lb/> ANNEX 1: A SUMMARY OF THE &quot; EFFECTIVE COVERAGE &quot; MEASURE<lb/></figure>

			<p>109.<lb/> The notion of &quot; effective coverage &quot; was introduced several years ago as a way of refining the<lb/> WHO framework for health system performance assessment (WHO, 2003). It has been defined as &quot; the<lb/> proportion of potential health gain that can be delivered through an intervention by the health system that is<lb/> actually delivered &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Lozano et al., 2006</ref>). If, for example, a health system could increase life expectancy<lb/> for women by two years through early detection and treatment for cervical cancer, but delivers only one<lb/> year, then effective coverage for this health problem is 50%. Effective coverage attempts to bring together<lb/> measures of the use of interventions, conditional on need, with the quality of the intervention delivered.<lb/> 110.<lb/> One of the first countries which tried to implement a measure of effective coverage was Mexico,<lb/> and some initial results are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>. Using data collection systems including health<lb/> examination surveys, vital registrations and hospital discharge information, 14 different health<lb/> interventions were monitored in 2005–06. 9 Effective coverage for these 14 interventions taken together<lb/> was found to vary across different areas of Mexico, from 54% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65% in the more<lb/> affluent Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions varied by<lb/> household wealth, from 52% for the lowest wealth quintile to 61% for the highest quintile. Inequalities<lb/> existed between income quintiles for the combination of all 14 interventions measured, for maternal and<lb/> child health coverage (8 interventions) and for other adult interventions (6 interventions). The absolute gap<lb/> in effective maternal and child health coverage was 9% between lowest and higher income quintiles, and<lb/> 14% for other adult interventions (<ref type="biblio">Lozano et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/> 111.<lb/> The selection of interventions to monitor is dependent on available data, and several sources may<lb/> be needed. These include biomedical data (e.g. to test for HIV infection, blood pressure, blood sugar or<lb/> cholesterol). A number of important questions need to be answered in order to determine effective<lb/> coverage, namely, who needs an intervention, who receives the intervention and what was the quality of<lb/> the intervention? Answering each of these requires measurement. To enable cross-country comparison, a<lb/> core set of coverage indicators and a standard survey module are needed, with measurement of the<lb/> distribution of coverage carried out across all socioeconomic groups. Effective coverage may have broad<lb/> applicability in both developing and developed countries, although substantial data developmental work<lb/> would be needed to implement this approach at the national and international level.<lb/></p>
