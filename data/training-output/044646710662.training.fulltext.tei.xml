			<head>I. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>&quot; The life of money making is one undertaken under compulsion, and wealth is evidently not the<lb/> good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else &quot; .<lb/> Aristotle, The Nichomachean Ethics, Book I.5, written around 350 B.C.<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the past decade we have witnessed a double convergence. Aid donors have<lb/> developed an increasing interest in the private sector while private banks have created corporate<lb/> social responsibility programs, sustainable lending or microfinance programmes. This paper<lb/> aims to map potential synergies between private banks and aid donors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the course of the first OECD Global Forum on Development, held in early<lb/> April 2007, many aid donors expressed a growing interest for a deeper dialogue with the private<lb/> sector, including corporations or foundations, for example 1 . This interest found echo in the first<lb/> flagship publication of the OECD Development Centre on development financing (OECD,<lb/> 2007a), which argued on the need to go beyond aid and incorporate new actors into the financing<lb/> of development. The 2005 OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) annual report also<lb/> stressed the fundamental importance of this deepening dialogue with the private sector (OECD,<lb/></p>

				<formula>2007b).<lb/></formula>

			<p>Over the past decade, bilateral donors have developed new financial tools and<lb/> institutions to improve their work with developing countries. Following the assumption that<lb/> public money may be a catalyst for private resources, leading donor agencies have strived to<lb/> mobilise private sector resources and capacities for poverty reduction. Most European donors,<lb/> for example, have established Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) operating on a<lb/> commercial basis, that have become an integral part of government development policy.<lb/> For instance, in 2005, Switzerland established the Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging<lb/> Markets (SIFEM) 2 , as a spin-off of SECO (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, one of the<lb/> main national institutions in charge of development cooperation). In collaboration with other<lb/> donor agencies such as Proparco (the French Development Finance Institution, a subsidiary of<lb/> 1.<lb/> See the web page devoted to the OECD Global Forum on Development: http:</p>

			<table>//www.oecd.org/dev<lb/> 2.<lb/> See for more information: http://www.sifem.ch/<lb/> the French Development Agency 3 ) or the Belgian Investment Company for Developing<lb/> Countries (BIO<lb/> 4 ), SIFEM now participates in many private equity projects around the developing<lb/> world, working with local private financial operators like Tuninvest in Tunisia, Fidelity Capital<lb/> Partners (a private venture capital and private equity company, subsidiary of Fidelity<lb/> Investment) in Ghana, Ethos in South Africa, Nexxus in Mexico or BTS Investment Advisors in<lb/> India 5 . As we will see, these initiatives are not the only ones where private and public<lb/> institutions have converged to boost development projects.<lb/></table>

			<p>These national financial institutions also developed the European Development Finance<lb/> Institutions (EDFI) network, a group of fifteen bilateral institutions providing long-term capital<lb/> for private sector enterprises in developing and reforming economies. The institutions in this<lb/> group share common objectives but are quite different in the way they develop their operations.<lb/> Some of them are still mostly financial institutions offering capital and advice to joint venture<lb/> enterprises in developing countries, and collaborating on projects with national. Danish IFU,<lb/></p>

			<table>Swedish Swedfund or Spanish COFIDES<lb/> 6 , both members of EDFI, support projects mostly in a<lb/> context of Danish or Spanish companies&apos; involvement.<lb/> Other members like CDC 7 , a UK government-owned fund with nearly $3 billion of net<lb/> assets, work actively with worldwide private equity partners like London based Aureos Capital,<lb/> Indian based Barings Private Partners or ICICI Venture, Canadian based Cordiant or Citigroup<lb/> Venture Capital<lb/> 8 . As an example, in 2007 CDC backed a new African initiative, committing<lb/> $100 million to Citigroup&apos;s first private equity vehicle entirely dedicated to Africa. The<lb/> Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO)<lb/> 9 , another leading and very active EDFI,<lb/> 3.<lb/> See http://www.proparco.fr/. Interestingly, among the institutions that fund Proparco are also some<lb/> French private banks like BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Natixis, Dexia Crédit Local or other private<lb/> financial institutions like COFACE or Gras Savoye. African banks or other financial institutions from<lb/> developing countries also participate in the capital, for example, Banque Marocaine du Commerce<lb/> Extérieur, Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) or Banque de Tunisie. The Aga Khan<lb/> Fund is particularly interesting. It is an international development agency dedicated to promoting<lb/> entrepreneurship and building economically sound enterprises in the developing world. On Aga Khan<lb/> Fund see http://www.akdn.org/agency/akfed.html<lb/> 4.<lb/> http://www.b-i-o.be/<lb/> 5.<lb/> See: http://www.tuninvest.com/;<lb/> http://fidelitycapitalpartners.com/; http://www.btsadvisors.com/;<lb/> http://www.nexxuscapital.com/; and http://www.ethos.co.za/live/index.php<lb/> 6.<lb/> See http://www.ifu.dk/http://www.swedfund.se/; and http://www.cofides.es/. Swedfund developed an<lb/> interesting strategy of partnering with private sector asset managers and private equity companies like<lb/> East Capital (http://www.eastcapital.com/) or Swedish companies like Tetra Pak or Ikea. Interestingly,<lb/> as for Proparco, COFIDES also has private banks involved in its core capital, mainly BBVA, Santander<lb/> and Banco Sabadell.<lb/> 7.<lb/> See http://www.cdcgroup.com/<lb/> 8.<lb/> See<lb/> http://www.aureos.com/;<lb/> https://www.citigroupai.com/;<lb/> http://www.bpepindia.com/;<lb/> http://www.iciciventure.com/; and http://www.cordiantcap.com/.<lb/> 9.<lb/> FMO was formed in 1970 through a partnership between the Dutch government (the majority<lb/> shareholder with 51 per cent) and Dutch financial institutions like ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, In<lb/> © OECD 2007<lb/> launched with Citigroup in 2006 a $540 million risk sharing facility aimed at providing loans to<lb/> small and medium sized companies in poor countries. This was the first global partnership<lb/> between an EDFI institution and a leading private retail bank. EDFIs have even participated in<lb/> the creation of private equity companies, one of the most dynamic being Aureos Capital, created<lb/> in 2001 by two leading EDFIs, the Norwegian Norfund (Norwegian Investment Fund for<lb/> Developing Countries) and the UK&apos;s CDC Capital Partners 10 .<lb/></table>

			<p>Private banks have also shown an increasing awareness of social, environmental or<lb/> labour issues in developing countries. In the course of their global expansion and acquisitions,<lb/> OECD-based bankers have encountered new realities, constraints and opportunities in<lb/> developing countries. Through either their lending operations, retail business on the ground or<lb/> investment banking and asset management activities, emerging markets and developing<lb/> countries have gradually grown to become core business areas. In parallel, when faced with<lb/> increased pressures and demands from NGOs, activist investors and government pressures,<lb/> private banks have also developed new programmes of sustainable lending and investment, and<lb/> corporate social responsibility. These private institutions have thus found themselves entering<lb/> projects in which they, directly or indirectly, may find themselves working to provide public<lb/> goods such as education, health, microfinance and remittances-related services to the poor.<lb/> Private banks have also become involved in infrastructure projects, and increasingly often<lb/> sealing partnerships with the public sector in many countries. In Brazil, the ABN Amro<lb/> subsidiary Banco Real 11 became a leading provider of micro-credits and grants to the poor for<lb/> education related activities. Spanish banks, which are heavily involved in Latin America, have<lb/> multiplied their initiatives throughout the region. Banco Santander, for example, promoted the<lb/> creation of a huge educational platform Universia 12 . Both of Spain&apos;s leading banks, Santander and<lb/> BBVA 13 , in 2000 participated together with other ministries and private corporations in the<lb/> creation of the Fundación Carolina, a unique Spanish institution funded by both the public and<lb/> private sectors whose aim is to provide grants for Latin American wishing to pursue studies in<lb/></p>

			<head>II. BANK LENDING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES<lb/></head>

			<p>Bank(er)s have been very active in developing economies over the past decades, either<lb/> through bank lending or through securities markets. The rising number of foreign claims (loans<lb/> made and deposits placed in other countries) is a good measure of the rapid internationalisation<lb/> of banking over the past decades. Nonetheless, it is not the only way in which OECD private<lb/> banks have been involved in emerging countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the past decades, OECD private banks have invested in and acquired major banks in<lb/> developing countries 15 , boosting the share of foreign bank credit in total domestic credit: South<lb/> America, for example, saw a jump from less than 6 per cent to nearly 40 per cent in 2005 16 . US<lb/> and Spanish banks have been the most active in developing countries: between 1990 and 2003,<lb/> they invested respectively $74 and $68 billion in developing countries, far ahead of UK<lb/> ($38 billion), German ($34 billion) or French ($32 billion) banks (<ref type="biblio">Goldberg, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Investment banks and asset managers did not stay behind in the emerging markets gold<lb/> rush, investing through their regional or global emerging market funds<lb/> 17 . International bank<lb/> lending also provides a good indicator of a division of labour that aids us in identifying key<lb/> potential partners and synergies for public sector aid donors. The sums involved are quite<lb/> 15. On internationalisation towards emerging markets, see <ref type="biblio">Moreno and Villar, 2005; Domanski, 2005;<lb/> Arena et al, 2006</ref>; Levy-<ref type="biblio">Yeyati and Micco, 2007; Cerutti et al, 2007</ref>, and on banking internationalisation<lb/> processes in general, see Schoenmaker and van Laecke, 2007.<lb/> 16. Obviously the differences between regions, Africa and Latin America, or even within a region are<lb/> important, foreign banks being much more present in some areas or countries than others. In Latin<lb/> America, foreign banks&apos; credit as a share of total domestic credit has jumped from less than 1 per cent to<lb/> more than 90 per cent in a country like Mexico, between 1990 and 2005, In Costa Rica it is still lower<lb/> than 1 per cent in 2005. In Belize, Bolivia or Panama, the share has been decreasing over the</p>

			<table>same<lb/> period (BIS, 2007).<lb/> 17. Not all the regions enjoyed a boom of portfolio flows, Africa remaining largely a &quot; frontier &quot; market with<lb/> less bond and equity flows than other emerging markets areas like Asia or Latin America. Most of the<lb/> Africa dedicated funds created in the 1990s by asset managers have been short lived, most of them<lb/> closing at the beginning of the 2000s. By 2006 only seven of the Africa dedicated equity funds remained<lb/> active. Interestingly, however, a new generation of funds started by the mid 2000s with asset managers<lb/> like Investec opening a Pan-African Fund. For Global Emerging Markets Funds, investing worldwide,<lb/> Africa represents 10 per cent of the total holdings, South Africa being by far the largest African holding<lb/> of this category of funds. The 11 other African markets, where some investments are registered,<lb/> attracted only a combined 0.03 per cent of total assets of global emerging markets funds. For a complete<lb/> review of foreign institutional investors&apos; activity in Africa see Moss, Ramachandran, Standley, 2007.<lb/> impressive: according to BIS, the total claims flowing from OECD private banks to emerging<lb/> economies in 2005 reached $230 billion, an amount twice as large as the total OECD official aid to<lb/> developing countries 18 .<lb/></table>

			<p>That said, bank flows to emerging markets remain much weaker than those crossing<lb/> borders between OECD countries: total cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks expanded by<lb/> nearly 3 000 billion in developed countries in 2005, ten times more than in developing countries.<lb/> All in all, by the end of 2005, the stock of cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks was<lb/> $21 450 billion (BIS, 2006). Of this total, the bulk was directed to OECD developed economies, all<lb/> of them democracies. Only $2 396 billion, less than 11 per cent of the total, went to emerging<lb/> markets economies, the bulk of which went to emerging democracies such as South Korea,<lb/> Brazil, and Mexico. A country like China only concentrates a stock of $114.6 billion of cross-<lb/>border bank claims, less than 0.53 per cent of the world stock 19 .<lb/> Private foreign bank lending nonetheless constitutes a substantial fraction of<lb/> development financing in emerging countries. As mentioned above, bank flows towards<lb/> emerging countries are very low (in nominal terms) when compared with OECD countries.<lb/> Despite this, bank loans are still very important for developing economies for despite actual<lb/> amounts received are much lower than their OECD counterparts in nominal terms they represent<lb/> a relatively high percentage of GDP. For example, in 2005, bank loans received by Brazil, Mexico<lb/> and South Korea were equivalent to 20.1 per cent, 34.3 per cent, and 28 per cent of their GDP,<lb/> respectively. Predictably, financial depth is lower in Latin America and Africa than in developed<lb/> countries: during the 1990s credit to the private sector represented a paltry 21 per cent of GDP in<lb/> sub-Saharan Africa and 28 per cent of GDP in Latin America, in comparison with the 84 per cent<lb/> of GDP in developed countries (<ref type="biblio">BIS, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Of particular relevance for aid donors looking to promote economic, social,<lb/> environmental and political development in emerging economies, private bankers have, over the<lb/> past decade, also begun, in their assessment of investment decisions, begun to take new variables<lb/> into account. In 2003, for example, a leading group of top global bankers adopted the Equator<lb/> Principles, an unprecedented initiative led by 10 of the world&apos;s largest banks to address the social<lb/> and environmental impact of the projects that they finance 20 . Based on IFC&apos;s environmental and<lb/> social standards and developed with IFC&apos;s advice, the Principles are a voluntary set of guidelines<lb/> for managing environmental and social issues in project finance lending. Since then, all the big<lb/> 18. This is in fact the tip of the iceberg of international banking involvement in developing countries as,<lb/> through the acquisitions processes, there has been an important shift towards more local activities,<lb/> through branches and subsidiaries, with the subsequent implication that direct cross border activities<lb/> are only part of the picture, with local lending by foreign banks in developing countries also being on<lb/> the rise as underlined by the IMF (</p>

			<table>IMF, 2007).<lb/> 19. In terms of bank assets the picture does not change as bank assets vis-à-vis OECD developed countries<lb/> account for 37 per cent of world GDP and bank assets vis-à-vis emerging economies less than 3 per cent<lb/> of world GDP.<lb/> 20. See http://www.equator-principles.com/. For a critical monitoring of this initiative by a group of leading<lb/> NGOs see BankTrack, Principles, profits or just PR? Triple P investments under the Equator principles. An<lb/> anniversary assessment, BankTrack, 2004. See also http://www.banktrack.org/<lb/> names in project finance (46 in total by early 2007, accounting for around 85 per cent of the<lb/> world&apos;s cross-border project finance and 80 per cent of the lending market by the end of 2006<lb/> 21 )<lb/></table>

			<p>have signed up for this series of guidelines for assessing their project finance deals, based on<lb/> those used by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank&apos;s private financing arm<lb/> (see Eiris, 2006 for an evaluation). As a result, the Equator Principles have become the project<lb/> finance industry&apos;s global standard for addressing environmental and social issues.<lb/> OECD banks with such impeccably capitalist credentials as Citibank, Standard Chartered,<lb/> Calyon, Dexia, Credit Suisse, Intesa Sanpaolo, Dresdner, BBVA, ABN Amro or HSBC have all<lb/> been eager to prove that their operations can measure up on sustainability goals. In 2006, a new<lb/> revised set of guidelines (Equator II) was produced and approved by private banks, again with<lb/> the help of the IFC. Equator II expands requirements for labour conditions, community health,<lb/> safety and security. In complement to this, the IFC and the</p>

			<figure>Financial Times launched in 2006 a<lb/> sustainable banking award. The following year, more than 151 institutions from 51 countries<lb/> submitted entries to the 2007 FT Sustainable Banking Awards, over 50 per cent more than the<lb/> 98 entries submitted to the inaugural 2006 Awards, a testimony to the programme&apos;s success and<lb/> banks&apos; increasing awareness of the issues promoted by the initiative.<lb/> Dialogue between private banks and aid donors has also been intensifying on a number<lb/> of levels, opening new avenues for collaboration. The UK official aid agency, Department for<lb/> International Development (DFID), jointly with the Dutch development finance arm FMO, DEG,<lb/> a subsidiary of Germany&apos;s KfW 22 , and the Development Bank of Southern Africa have created a<lb/> public private equity African Infrastructure Fund with UK based private banks, Barclays and<lb/> Standard Chartered, and the investment firm Emerging Markets Partnership 23 . The Government<lb/> of Canada also established a Canada Investment Fund for Africa (CIFA) 24 , a $220 million fund<lb/> dedicated to making private equity investments in businesses throughout Africa. Investors in<lb/> CIFA include the Canadian International Development Agency (through the Canada Fund for<lb/> Africa program) and CDC Group plc. The fund is managed through a joint venture between two<lb/> leading private equity fund managers, London based Aureos Capital and Montreal based<lb/> Cordiant 25 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>In both sending and recipient countries, banks such as BBVA, the leading Spanish bank in<lb/> Latin America, have targeted specific projects and programmes dedicated to migrants and<lb/> remittance recipients. The extent of services provided go well beyond financing: in early 2007,<lb/> BBVA launched a foundation dedicated to microfinance with an initial endowment of<lb/> €200 million, making it one of the major initiatives in this field in Latin America. The bank<lb/> became the first private international banking group to embrace micro-finance with direct<lb/> investment via a non profit-making foundation. BBVA Microfinance Foundation</p>

			<table>initiated its first<lb/> 21. See http://www.equator-principles.com/documents/ClientBriefingforEquatorPrinciples_2007-02-07.pdf<lb/> 22. See http://www.kfw.de/EN_Home/index.jsp; and http://www.deginvest.de/EN_Home/index.jsp. DEG<lb/> is one the largest European development finance institutions (EDFI) with €1.1 billion of equity capital.<lb/> 23. See http://www.emergingafricafund.com/stake_fr.htm . See also http://www.empglobal.com/<lb/> 24. See http://www.cifafund.ca/<lb/> 25.

			<p>The potential synergies between private banks and aid donors are therefore considerable.<lb/> In order to provide an analytical tool and to help identify potential partners for aid donors, we<lb/> conducted a survey of private bank lending towards developing countries, to identify the most<lb/> active private bankers in those economies. More precisely we find an international division of<lb/> bank lending: UK banks are, for example, much more active in Africa than any others, along with<lb/> some French based banks, while Spanish banks remain attached to Latin America, a region<lb/> where US banks are also heavily involved. In Asia, the leading private lenders are UK based<lb/> banks, followed by US banks. In Eastern Europe, Austrian and German banks dominate lending<lb/> activities, although, after recent mergers and acquisitions operations, Italian and Belgian banks<lb/> are also becoming increasingly heavy players in this region. Other private lenders like Dutch,<lb/> Swedish or Swiss banks have a more global and balanced portfolio.<lb/></p>

			<p>For aid donors willing to develop financing programs with private bank actors, Spanish<lb/> banks would be the natural partners in Latin America, while French or UK banks would be more<lb/> suited for African related projects, as US and UK banks might be in Asia. In Eastern Europe, the<lb/> natural partners would be German and Austrian private banks, along with perhaps Italian and<lb/> Belgian banks.<lb/></p>

			<p>The mapping of private bank lending also helps introduce a more micro-exercise, relating<lb/> to the specific projects already developed by private bankers and aid donors. We identify<lb/> outstanding case studies and best practices, with the objective of underlining the available<lb/> avenues for international cooperation activities in terms of public/private partnerships between<lb/> private banks and aid donors.<lb/> 26. See presentations by Francisco González, President of BBVA, and Manuel Méndez, President of BBVA<lb/> Microfinance Foundation, Fundación BBVA par alas microfinanzas, Madrid, February 2007. According to<lb/> the IADB more than 4.5 million of borrowing households in Latin America were connected in 2005 with<lb/> a microenterprise and microfinance (<ref type="biblio">Navajas and Tejerino, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>III. PRIVATE BANK LENDING FLOWS</head>

			<figure>TO EMERGING MARKETS:<lb/> STYLISED FACTS<lb/> The current trend of increasing financial integration and the opening up of emerging<lb/> countries to capital flows has brought about a sharp increase in foreign bank claims over the past<lb/> decade. This brought private international loans to reach the equivalent to 48.3 per cent of global<lb/> GDP in 2005 27 , more than the total of international trade flows combined with global foreign<lb/> direct investment and tourist receipts (from 32 per cent in 1999 — a jump of more than<lb/> 16 percentage points in only half a decade). In real terms, foreign claims in all non-BIS reporting<lb/> countries<lb/> 28 rose by more than 120 per cent, while claims in developing countries jumped by more<lb/> than 100 per cent.<lb/> Among emerging countries, Latin America and Eastern Europe experienced the biggest<lb/> increase, rising by more than 110 per cent and 165 per cent respectively. It is interesting to note<lb/> that both of these regions are where democratisation and the consolidation of democracy have<lb/> been the most intensive<lb/> 29 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>27. The Bank for International Settlements, which monitors the foreign claims held by banks mostly from<lb/> OECD countries vis-à-vis the rest of the world, defines these claims as those authorised by international<lb/> banks on residents outside the country in which they are headquartered.</p>

			<table>Foreign claims may range<lb/> from assets such as loans, debt securities to equities, including equity stakes in local subsidiaries.<lb/> 28. There are a total of 40 BIS reporting countries in 2007, i.e. financial centers providing locational banking<lb/> data. Not all OECD countries provide this data (this is the case, for example, of Iceland or Poland).<lb/> Some non-OECD and developing countries like Chile or Brazil do provide this data to the BIS. The<lb/> major non-BIS reporting emerging countries are Argentina, China, Russia, and South Africa. There is no<lb/> BIS reporting country from Africa.<lb/> 29. For an analysis of the relations between democracy and private bank lending, see Rodríguez and<lb/> Santiso, 2007.<lb/> © OECD 2007<lb/></table>

			<figure>Graph 1. Global Foreign Claims (% of Global GDP)<lb/> World Foreign Claims (% of World GDP)<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 1999<lb/> 2000<lb/> 2001<lb/> 2002<lb/> 2003<lb/> 2004<lb/> 2005<lb/> %<lb/> Source: based on BIS and IMF<lb/></figure>

			<p>This increase in foreign claim flows is due to a number of factors. Financing has the<lb/> advantage of being less restricted than trade, tourism, direct and portfolio investments and<lb/> remittances. For trade and tourism flows, distance is the determining factor: the greater the<lb/> distance between countries, the greater the transaction cost. The situation is similar for<lb/> remittances, which reflect in general migration patterns, which are more based on proximity or<lb/> historical or cultural ties<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast, foreign claims are not limited either by distance or other limiting factors, and<lb/> therefore have few constraints with regards the destination of funds. The greater dynamism of<lb/> foreign claim flows should also be emphasised in that loans can be granted or received<lb/> immediately, since little information is needed to carry out a transaction and the time required<lb/> for closing such deals is minimal. The reduced time involved favours foreign claim flows,<lb/> compared with trade or direct investments, which require longer periods for closure. Foreign<lb/> claims are also more liquid than other fund flows.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to define the mapping of private bank lending flows to developing countries, we<lb/> draw on the BIS&apos;s &quot;Consolidated Foreign Claims of Reporting Banks on Individual Countries&quot;<lb/> statistical series for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the first quarter of 2006. The BIS<lb/> collates data on the international loans of private banks and deposit organisations worldwide,<lb/> and separates data on domestic loans from foreign loans. Domestic loans are those advanced to<lb/> third persons resident in the country where the bank is based. The BIS does not provide any<lb/> information on these operations.<lb/> Foreign loans are provided to third persons resident in a different country from the one<lb/> where the bank is based. These foreign claims can also be divided into: i) cross-border positions<lb/> — for example, credits granted by the head office of a Spanish bank to a Mexican organisation —<lb/> and ii) local positions, managed, for example, by a Mexican branch of a Spanish bank. At the<lb/> same time, credits granted by local branches may be divided into those denominated in foreign<lb/> currencies and those denominated in local currency. The concept of Foreign Claims, as<lb/> developed by the BIS, includes all loans granted by one country to another, independent of the<lb/> currency in which they were made and also of where they were granted (either by the head office<lb/> or one of its branches). The BIS periodically publishes this data in their Consolidated Banking<lb/> Statistics as well as what it defines as International Claims, where it only includes foreign currency<lb/> positions, independent of where they were granted<lb/> 30 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The 27 countries that report the international operations of their banks and deposit<lb/> institutions to the BIS are: Austria; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Chinese Taipei; Denmark;<lb/> Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong, China; India; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Luxembourg;<lb/> Norway; Panama; the Netherlands; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey, the UK and<lb/> the US. The respective banking authorities of these countries compile the information and send it<lb/> on a quarterly basis to the BIS 31 .<lb/> A detailed analysis of the data shows that international financing is dominated by a<lb/> limited number of countries. The 27 countries that report to the BIS issue overseas credits<lb/> totalling $23.5 trillion (2006). This is equivalent to approximately 95 per cent of total private<lb/> international loans according to the BIS. There are, however, other countries not included in the<lb/> list of those that report to the BIS which are net issuers of international loans, such as some oil<lb/> exporting countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia). The figures also show that the recipients of<lb/> international loans are strongly concentrated.<lb/></p>

			<p>As well as being the main issuers of international loans, the more developed countries are<lb/> also the main recipients. That is to say, loans are made mainly between developed countries. In<lb/> 2006, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the<lb/> Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US accounted for 81.5 per cent of the<lb/> total loans issued by the countries that report to the BIS, and in turn received 75 per cent of the<lb/> total.<lb/></p>

			<p>During the 2000s, European banks have been the main financing organisations<lb/> worldwide. In 2006, Germany, the UK, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands accounted for<lb/> 50.6 per cent of loans globally, with Germany the leading lender with 13.4 per cent of total loans<lb/> granted globally. On the other hand, the country that receives most private loans is the US, with<lb/> 22.5 per cent of the total. The US is the main recipient of international funds, sourced mainly<lb/> from Europe. The five European countries mentioned above receive 32.9 per cent of total loans.<lb/> They therefore grant more loans than they receive, while the US grants only 5.23 per cent and<lb/> receives 22.5 per cent of the total. Since banks only grant loans when they believe the principal<lb/> and interest charges are recoverable, logic dictates that developed countries be the main<lb/> recipients of credit because of their better risk-return profile and repayment capacity.<lb/></p>

			<figure>France is a case of particular interest that deserves some specific attention. It is the major<lb/> source of finance for countries to which the US does not lend, for political or other reasons. In<lb/> 2006, France was the principal lender to 37 countries, 20 of which receive no finance from the US<lb/> (out of the 67 countries to which the US does not provide loans). This means that 30 per cent of<lb/> the countries that receive no funding from the US rely on France as their main source of<lb/> financing (down from 40 per cent in 2004). Of the 47 remaining countries to which the US does<lb/> not grant loans, Germany is the main source of funding for 10 of them. In 2006, France and<lb/> Germany together therefore provided finance to approximately 45 per cent of these countries<lb/> (65 per cent in 2004).<lb/></figure>

			<p>France and Germany are also an important source of financing for countries that are, or<lb/> have been, on non-friendly terms with the US. In 2006, Germany, for example, was the main<lb/> lender to Syria and Libya, and France to Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Somalia and<lb/> Vietnam.<lb/></p>

			<figure>IV. A WORLD MAP OF INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE BANK LENDING<lb/> DIVISION OF LABOUR<lb/> Several conclusions may be drawn from a detailed study of the destination of bank loans<lb/> to emerging countries. By region, Latin America and the Caribbean were the main recipients of<lb/> private bank flows in the mid-1980s, a phenomenon that has since subsided somewhat. At the<lb/> end of 1984, Latin America and the Caribbean were receiving 47 per cent of the flows to<lb/> emerging countries, while Africa received about 21 per cent, Asia 20 per cent and Europe 12 per<lb/> cent (See Table 1 of Appendix 1).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Of all regions Africa has lost out most over the period, as the growth in loans it has<lb/> received has been below the rate of growth in loans to emerging markets as a whole. As a result,<lb/> the percentage of flows to emerging markets received by Africa has fallen over time. There is a<lb/> certain noticeable asymmetry over time between Asia and Latin America regarding the receipt of<lb/> foreign loans. During periods when Latin America&apos;s share of financing has fallen, Asia&apos;s share<lb/> has grown, and when Latin America has begun to recover, it has been Asia that has lost out.<lb/> Emerging European countries have seen a steady increase in bank inflows, especially from 1996<lb/> onwards.<lb/> Up until the fourth quarter of 2003, Latin America was the biggest recipient of bank flows<lb/> towards emerging economies. Since the beginning of 2004, Asia is the region receiving the<lb/> biggest share of funding to emerging economies (31.4 per cent of the total in Q1 2006). In 2006,<lb/> Emerging Europe was the second biggest destination for loans to emerging countries with<lb/> 31.1 per cent of the total, followed by Latin America with 24.5 per cent, and Africa bringing up<lb/> the rear with only 13 per cent.<lb/></p>

			<p>As seen above, Latin America has received the most bank inflows over the past 20 years 32 .<lb/> This is due mainly to Mexico and Brazil, the two countries in the region that have received the<lb/> biggest share of total loans to emerging markets. In addition, these countries are the individual<lb/> emerging economies that have received the most finance over the past two decades, with flows<lb/> exceeding those directed at Asian emerging economies, although Asia and Emerging Europe as<lb/> regions have obtained more financing than Latin America. This is due to the greater<lb/></p>

Mexico and Brazil<lb/> received similar amounts of financing until the second half of the 1990s when Brazil grew in<lb/> importance as a destination for loans, while Mexico decreased. But from 2000 onwards, Mexico<lb/> became the emerging country that received most loans, with 10.5 per cent of the total in 2005 (a<lb/> percentage of total loans similar to that received by Africa and the Middle East in the same year).<lb/> On the other hand, Brazil&apos;s importance for banking investment fell considerably after 2002, with<lb/> its share of total emerging bank flows falling from 10.5 per cent at the end of 2001 to a mere<lb/> 6.9 per cent in 2006.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Venezuela have experienced a<lb/> considerable drop in the amount of financing received from foreign banks.

			<p>It is also important to observe emerging bank flows from the point of view of the issuing<lb/> country. As noted above, Germany is the leading financing country globally, followed by other<lb/> European economies and Japan, while the US is the biggest worldwide recipient of finance.<lb/> When we observe private bank flows towards emerging countries, we can see that the leading<lb/> financing country is the UK, followed by the US, Germany, Spain, France and the Netherlands.<lb/> When we compare the relative importance of private bank financing at international level and<lb/> private bank financing towards emerging countries, two countries stand out: the US and Spain.<lb/> Both countries are characterised by the fact that they receive loans at an international level<lb/> (mainly from Europe) and simultaneously are major source countries for emerging economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The US is the second major financer of emerging countries, being the second biggest in<lb/> Asia and Latin America and the fourth largest in Africa. Spain is the fourth biggest lender to<lb/> emerging economies, and is the leading one in Latin America, where it is even bigger than the<lb/> US. However, there are a number of differences between the two. While the US is a big financer<lb/> of emerging economies, it does not assign a high proportion of its total lending to these<lb/> economies. Spain, however, is a major financing country for emerging markets and assigns more<lb/> loans to these economies in relative terms. In addition, Spanish bank loans to emerging countries<lb/> are heavily concentrated in Latin America (95.6 per cent of the total of Spanish bank loans to<lb/> emerging markets) (for a comparison between US and Spanish international foreign claims and<lb/> their determinants see García-Herrero and Martínez-Pería, 2007).<lb/></p>

			<p>The main financers of the US are the banks of politically neutral Switzerland, granting<lb/> 22.3 per cent of the total bank funds received. This amount ($857 billion), which is higher than<lb/> Spain&apos;s GDP, accounts for 48.8 per cent of Switzerland&apos;s total foreign claims. The US in turn is<lb/> the second financer of Asia, although by country it focuses its financing on those that are closest<lb/> to it. It is the main lender to almost all of Central America (Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and<lb/> Honduras), in addition to several islands in the Caribbean (Haiti, Jamaica) and to neighbouring<lb/> Canada. Normally, it is the second or third biggest lender to the rest of the countries bordering or<lb/> geographically close to it (Mexico, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago). US banks are the main<lb/> financers of only one South American country: Uruguay. (See <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>			<figure>of Appendix 1).<lb/> The US directs 40.5 per cent of its total private bank emerging market loans towards Latin<lb/> American countries. This level is below the 42.4 per cent that it assigns to Asia, but it is above the<lb/> average of 28.9 per cent that it disburses to all the countries of the world. Its emerging market<lb/> loans are focused on Mexico, which receives 22.7 per cent of the total (See Table 3 of Appendix 1).<lb/> In terms of foreign claims, for example, US banks are also particularly active in Mexico with the<lb/> ratio of US claims to total foreign claims reaching 97 per cent in 2003. Cross-border claims by US<lb/> banks have also been replaced over the past years by claims from US banks, branches and<lb/> subsidiaries located in Latin American countries themselves (Goldberg, 2006).<lb/> Spain is the major financing country of ten of the thirty Latin American countries that<lb/> appear in BIS statistics. The most important recipients are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,<lb/> Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. In addition, it is the second biggest lender to Cuba and<lb/> Uruguay. Together, the US and Spain are the leading private bankers of 17 of the 30 countries in<lb/> Latin America.<lb/></figure>

			<p>With regards to the remaining thirteen countries in Latin America, Panama&apos;s importance<lb/> as the main financer of Costa Rica and Nicaragua merits mention. France is the main lender to<lb/> Cuba and Switzerland is the main banker of Belize and St. Vincent, whilst Germany is the main<lb/> banker of Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands is the main lender to Suriname. The UK and<lb/> Italy are not the main financing countries of any country in Latin America despite being among<lb/> the leading financers of the region.<lb/> Spain, as has already been indicated, directs 95.6 per cent of its loans towards Latin<lb/> American emerging markets, as underlined by <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. It is the highest concentration of bank<lb/> flows in Latin America after Mexico and Panama, with 98.5 per cent and 99.8 per cent,<lb/> respectively. Spanish loans are heavily biased towards Mexico where it grants 48.25 per cent of<lb/> its total loans.<lb/></p>

In addition, it is almost the leading financer of<lb/> the member countries of the Commonwealth, being the main lender of 50 per cent of the nations<lb/> that make up the bloc.<lb/> Like Spain and the UK, the countries where France occupies the leading position reflect<lb/> its current international ties, derived to a large extent from its past history. In a similar fashion to<lb/> the Commonwealth, the</p>

			<figure>Francophonie groups together its ex-colonies (and a few other countries).<lb/> It is significant that of the 41 countries where France is the leading lender no fewer than 28 are<lb/> members of this organisation (2004). France is the second biggest lender to Africa and the Middle<lb/> East, where it accounts for 17.6 per cent of the international financing received by these regions.<lb/> Similarly, Austria and Japan are the top lenders to many of the countries that are<lb/> geographically close to them. Austria is the leader in the European emerging countries (Eastern<lb/> Europe) and the UK in Africa and the Middle East and Asia and Pacific countries. Japan is the<lb/> lead lender of several countries in South and East Asia. Italian banks, because of the recent<lb/> takeovers of German and Austrian entities, are also becoming major players in European<lb/> emerging economies. An interesting exception is Germany, which is a major lender to Eastern<lb/> European countries but also ranks relatively high in terms of lending activity in Asia, Africa and<lb/> Latin America (on foreign direct investment activities by German banks, see Buch and Lipponer,<lb/> 2007).<lb/></figure>

			<head>V. SUSTAINABLE BANKING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES<lb/></head>

			<p>As banks have been increasing their exposure to developing countries, both through<lb/> lending activities and foreign direct acquisitions, so have issues of sustainable development<lb/> increasingly come to the fore. For international development banks, this concern has been at the<lb/> core of their activities for many years. It is, however, only more recently that private, both<lb/> commercial and investment, banks around the world are taking on board sustainable<lb/> development issues, particularly in their lending practices.<lb/> This in turn has led to a much greater awareness of social and environmental issues<lb/> among the companies asking for project finance. Broadly speaking, this has meant more concern<lb/> for protecting environmental goods such as water, air and soil, human rights and social issues.<lb/> Reputation considerations, amid mounting evidence that seeking sustainable lending makes<lb/> sound commercial sense, have been driving this increasing interest (for corporations operating in<lb/> developing countries, see <ref type="biblio">Colonomos and Santiso, 2005</ref>). The activism of NGOs and also<lb/> important international actors such as the IFC, the subsidiary and private sector lending arm of<lb/> the World Bank, has played a leading role in increasing the profile of these issues. Activist<lb/> investors have also pressured banks to move away from reputational risks 33 . The growth of<lb/> socially responsible investment funds has also added pressure on banks to account for aspects<lb/> beyond standard financial variables. Bank Sarasin, a private Swiss bank, for example, set up a<lb/> sustainable division in the early 1990s that now manages €2 billion in funds dedicated to<lb/> sustainable investments, targeting banks amongst other corporations. Dexia Asset Management,<lb/> the fund manager arm of Dexia Group, also became increasingly active in the emerging segment<lb/> of socially responsible funds.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Yes Bank, which is 20 per cent owned by Rabobank of the Netherlands, actively evaluates<lb/> the social and environmental risks when considering lending operations. While it is a rare<lb/> exception in the Asian banking landscape, Yes Bank also points to a trend of sustainable banking<lb/> in developing countries. Following the trends of their Western peers, Asian banks are<lb/> increasingly making public statements underlining the sustainable development aspect of their<lb/> lending practices. Like their Japanese counterparts, such as Mizuho Corporate Bank, financial<lb/> institutions like South Korea&apos;s Kookmin Bank, Woori Bank and Export Import Bank are joining<lb/> initiatives like the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative.<lb/> 33. See for example, the study Developer by Foreign &amp; Colonial Asset Management, one of the major fund<lb/> managers in emerging markets, F&amp;C Asset Management, Banking on human rights: confronting human<lb/> rights in the financial sector, London, F&amp;C Asset Management, 2004.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In India, private sector players are also actively involved in socially responsible<lb/> investments. Recently Dutch ABN Amro&apos;s Indian asset management arm opened its Sustainable<lb/> Development Fund, a three-year closed-end scheme. The fund will invest in companies that rank<lb/> high on a number of attributes, such as environment compliance and compliance to corporate<lb/> governance rules etc., indicating a high level of social responsibility. Ratings major, CRISIL, will<lb/> establish the ranking based on a set of parameters and review the list annually. Thereafter, ABN<lb/> Amro&apos;s fund team will carry out financial analysis of the companies that make the cut for final<lb/> investment decision. Globally those types of funds categorised as socially responsible investment<lb/></p>

			<figure>(SRI) held over $2.3 trillion in assets in 2006 in the US alone, according to the Social Investment<lb/> Forum 34 , which represented an increase of 260 per cent since 1995, and nearly €1 trillion in 2006<lb/> in Europe, according to Eurosif 35 (for more analysis on SRI developments see Santiso, 2005).<lb/> ABN Amro manages about $2 billion in about 24 SRI funds. The interest for socially responsible<lb/> investments within and towards emerging markets is increasing as suggested by the boom of<lb/> studies dedicated to this asset class of investments (see, for example, Eiris, 2006).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Asset management arms, either of banks or specialised institutions, through their<lb/> increasing interest for socially responsible investments, are other potential partners for aid<lb/> donors and/or NGOs willing to boost their impacts in developing countries and on development<lb/> issues. The same applies for pension funds, particularly the public funds and those managing the<lb/> assets of employees working in administrations. In California, Calpers<lb/> 36 , an active $230 billion<lb/> fund manager providing retirement and health benefits for 1.5 million public sector employees,<lb/> deployed over the past decades a remarkable socially responsible strategy, applied not only to<lb/> investments made in developed countries but also in developing countries since the years 2000s.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Europe another public pension fund active in socially responsibility is the Dutch ABP<lb/> Investments, a firm with more than €200 billion of assets under management 37 . Other important<lb/> European public pension funds at the forefront of these issues are AP2 from Sweden or<lb/> Metallrente from Germany. In France the Fonds de Réserve des Retraites also adopted in 2005<lb/> socially responsible investment strategies for part of its €31 billion of assets under management,<lb/> following Calpers&apos; pioneering strategy 38 . Early in 2007, the Spanish public pension system also<lb/> operated a move in the same direction, although limiting its socially responsible investment<lb/> screening to developed countries only.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another promising area is private banking, with certain wealthy individuals now<lb/> pressuring their private bankers not only to provide ethical investment products but also advice<lb/> for investments with &quot; social performance &quot; (on private banking see UNEP Finance Initiative,<lb/> 2007). Topics at the core of the development agenda, whether poverty reduction, water or climate<lb/> change, has also moved up the agenda of private bankers, investors or insurers (see</p>

			<table>for example<lb/> 34. See http://www.socialinvest.org/areas/research/trends/sri_trends_report_2005.pdf. It represents nearly<lb/> 9 per cent of the total of assets under management in the US investment funds industry.<lb/> 35.

			<p>Private equity and specialised investment companies operating in developing countries<lb/> also hold potential as partners for development. We have seen that some European Development<lb/> Finance Institutions (EDFI), such as UK based CDC or Dutch based FMO, have already<lb/> developed effective partnerships while others are planning to team up with other public or<lb/> private institutions. Recently former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, created an emerging<lb/> markets fund. In 2007, Albright Capital Management and PGGM have come together to create a<lb/> long-term, multi asset class emerging markets fund 39 . PGGM is a Dutch pension fund that serves<lb/> the healthcare and social work sectors, and will serve as Albright Capital&apos;s strategic investor with<lb/> $329 million.<lb/> This initiative follows those of other recent US officials, like Nicholas Brady, the former<lb/> US Treasury Secretary who helped to address the debt crisis of the 1980s by creating the Brady<lb/> Bonds markets for emerging countries in the 1990s. In 1994, after his public career and position<lb/> as Chairman of the investment bank Dillon Read &amp; Co, he established a private equity, fixed<lb/> income and mezzanine finance investment company, Darby Overseas, specialising in developing<lb/> country projects. Nearly ten years later, in October 2003, the company was acquired by Franklin<lb/> Templeton Investments, one of the largest global investment management organisations. The<lb/> company manages nearly $1 billion through different investment vehicles and partnerships<lb/> 40 .<lb/></p>

			<p>One year later, another US political senior official, Al Gore, also helped to create an investment<lb/> company (Generation Investment Management) dedicated to long-term sustainable investments,<lb/> with former employees of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Sustainable Asset<lb/> Management.<lb/> In developing countries, former senior officials have also been playing an active role in<lb/> setting up private equity firms and investment companies. In Brazil, for example, Arminio Fraga,<lb/> a former Central Bank Governor, created one of the most successful investment firms, Gavea<lb/> Investimentos 41 , following the example of <ref type="biblio">Gustavo</ref> Franco, also a former Central Bank Governor<lb/> who created Rio Bravo 42 , another investment firm. Some of the private equity firms have already<lb/> reached a critical size in terms of asset under management like, for example, GP Investments 43 .<lb/> Also interesting, Brazilian pension funds, like Previ and Petros among others, have been active in<lb/> the socially responsible investment area, and are supporters of poverty reduction programs like<lb/> the one led by Lula&apos;s government Fome Zero 44 . This is also the case of Brazilian private banks like<lb/> 39. See http://www.albrightcapital.com/<lb/> 40. See http://www.darbyoverseas.com/<lb/> 41. See http://www.gaveainvest.com.br/<lb/> 42.

			<table>Unibanco, Itaú or Bradesco, who, along with public banks or development banks like BNDES 45 ,<lb/> are involved in development finance projects all around the country<lb/> 46 . In Mexico, Pedro Aspe, a<lb/> former Minister of Finance, also created a successful investment and consulting firm, Protego,<lb/> specialising in medium size companies 47 .<lb/></table>

			<p>Probably one of the most successful institutions is Fundación Chile, a privately owned,<lb/> non profit institution created in 1976 by the Chilean government and the US multinational ITT<lb/> (in 2005 the mining company BHP Billiton also became a co-founding member and boosted the<lb/> endowment of the institution). This institution pursues innovation, with special emphasis on<lb/> areas like agribusiness, marine resources, forestry, fruit biotechnology, quality management,<lb/> food technologies, etc. The development of the salmon industry is among one of the successes of<lb/> the Foundation. When it targeted that area, salmon exports from Chile barely existed. Now Chile<lb/> is, along with Norway, one of the top exporters of salmon in the world.<lb/> Private equity and investment firms operating in developing countries are common. It is<lb/> not rare for them to be created by former public officials or former senior officials of leading<lb/> international organisations involved in development 48 . They provide another set of potential<lb/> partners for aid donors willing to catalyse private investment in niche markets where the usual<lb/> bankers and investment firms are not looking. In 2006, private equity firms operating in<lb/> developing countries raised a record of more than $33 billion in capital commitments, a more<lb/> than five-fold increase over the $6 billion raised in</p>

			<table>2004<lb/> 49 . A firm like the Washington-based<lb/> Emerging Markets Partners, created in the mid-nineties by former World Bank officers, is one of<lb/> largest private equity firms investing in emerging markets with seven funds holding around<lb/> $6 billion in cumulative capital commitments and investment operations spanning the globe<lb/> from Korea to South Africa to Argentina 50 . In Africa, Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) has been<lb/> the first private equity group to raise more than $1 billion for investment in companies across the<lb/> continent 51 . Major hedge funds and investment companies like Amber Capital, a New York-<lb/>based firm, also created in 2007 private equity instruments to invest in developing countries like<lb/> 45. See http://www.bndes.gov.br/<lb/> 46. Unibanco<lb/> developed,<lb/> for<lb/> example,<lb/> a<lb/> social<lb/> arm,<lb/> Instituto<lb/> Unibanco:<lb/> http://www.unibanco.com.br/int/qsn/index.asp.

			<head>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Throughout history bankers and lenders in particular have been depicted as greedy and<lb/> callous. In Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy usurers are consigned within the seventh circle of hell,<lb/> peopled with vengeful Shylocks. Today&apos;s bankers and money lenders seem to be working in a<lb/> very different world. Examples abound of the increasing interest in sustainable banking over the<lb/> past years (see for example on Africa AICC Centre for Sustainability <ref type="biblio">Investing, 2004</ref>). As<lb/> documented in a related working paper (Javier Rodríguez and Javier <ref type="biblio">Santiso, 2007</ref>), private<lb/> banks play a pivotal role in economic development and — more surprisingly — can also lend a<lb/> helping hand in democratic consolidation, with cross border private banking flows tending to<lb/> increase in the years following a democratic transition 54 .<lb/> As underlined in this paper, private banks are actively involved in developing countries,<lb/> both through their lending activities from headquarters, and now increasingly from emerging<lb/> countries themselves, since they have been heavily investing in their economies, generating<lb/> employment, introducing best practices and many other positive outputs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Banks manage their own performance and sustainability but they are also in a position to<lb/> influence socio-economic and environmental performances in client organisations. Banks&apos;<lb/> lending activities also have an important impact (see Accountability — Institute of Social and<lb/> Ethical <ref type="biblio">Accountability, 2004</ref>). This paper stresses a major challenge, going well beyond aid<lb/> coordination: the increasing proliferation of actors, directly or indirectly involved in<lb/> development issues in low or middle income countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to tackle this issue, a deeper dialogue is required between aid donors and these<lb/> private actors. Banks, private equity and asset management firms are part of a much broader set<lb/> of private actors ranging from foundations to corporations. Mapping and coordinating this &quot; non<lb/> 54. For a review, based on good practices and case studies, of how financial services are affected by and<lb/> manage the challenges associated with human rights, see also the study of</p>

			<table>European asset manager<lb/> F&amp;C Asset Management and KPMG, Banking on Human Rights: Confronting Human Rights in the Financial<lb/> Sector, London, September 2004 and the F&amp;C (Isis Asset Management) reports available online:<lb/> http://www.isisam.com/aboutus.asp?pageid=2.8.3.7#banking. All in all, a total of 8 private banks<lb/> voluntarily developed internal human rights policies, standards, guidelines or statements: ABN<lb/> AMRO, Barclays, HBOS, ING, Rabobank, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Westpac.<lb/> Signatories to the UN Global Compact also pledge to avoid complicity in human rights violations. As of<lb/> March 2007, the Global Compact website indicates that 323 banking and insurance institutions are<lb/> members. For a systematic mapping of human rights treaties and norms that could be applied to<lb/> corporations and enforced by States, see the United Nations commissioned report written by the United<lb/> Nations Secretary General&apos;s Special Representative on Human Rights &amp; Business John Ruggie, 2007.<lb/> © OECD 2007<lb/></table>

			<p>system &quot; of development finance is as challenging as it is important for those seeking to improve<lb/> the lot of less-developed parts of the world (see <ref type="biblio">Mavrotas and Reisen, 2007</ref>; and, on the<lb/> fragmentation of aid and private foreign investment, see <ref type="biblio">Harms and Lutz, 2006</ref>).<lb/> Public aid donors who are willing to innovate in order to deepen impacts will find<lb/> interested counterparties and partners. As documented, some of these actors tend to operate by<lb/> specific region. UK and French banks, for example, would seem to be good potential partners for<lb/> aid donors in Africa while Spanish banks or US counterparts might be more relevant for Latin<lb/> America, and German, Swiss 55 and Italian banks for Eastern Europe. Beyond international banks,<lb/> local private banks in India, South Africa, Morocco and other developing countries are also<lb/> potential partners, these banks also being increasingly aware and sensitive to economic, social<lb/> and environmental impacts.<lb/></p>

			<p>In areas like remittances or microfinance, for example, banks operating in both recipient<lb/> countries like Latin America, and also in the sending countries, such as US and Spanish banks<lb/> could have an important role to play in public and private partnerships. In North Africa, French<lb/> players, along with local banks are also key potential partners. In infrastructure finance, whether<lb/> water, health or transport, public aid donors could play a pivotal role as a catalyst for deeper<lb/> involvement by private bankers, equity firms or asset managers in these sectors in developing<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The partnerships can obviously go well beyond solely the banking sector, as underlined<lb/> by the recent initiative of Danone, a French multinational, and the French banking group Crédit<lb/> Agricole, who, in 2007, jointly created a novel mutual to invest in microfinance projects in the<lb/> world&apos;s poorest countries. The first test will be in Bangladesh where Danone have already<lb/> created a joint venture with the Grameen Group of Nobel Prize winner Mohammad Yunus, who<lb/> has pioneered microfinance lending to the very poor 56 . Former executives are also creating<lb/> innovative ways to pull financing into microfinance institutions, like Pierre Omidyar, the eBay<lb/> founder, that created Omidyar Network<lb/> 57 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In the future, it could be interesting to repeat the current exercise and to map cross-border<lb/> banking operations, either trade finance, bank lending or investment flows, from emerging<lb/> countries to other developing economies. According to The World Bank, development finance is<lb/> experiencing a major transformation as emerging market based banks, companies and<lb/> governments are becoming global heavyweights in international development finance.</p>

			<figure>In 1995,<lb/> low-income country borrowers received a mere 3 per cent of their cross-border syndicated<lb/> lending flows from other emerging market banks. Ten years later that figure jumped to 17 per<lb/> cent. In 2005, a record of 27 per cent of all foreign banks in developing countries were owned by<lb/> 55. See for example in the field of remittances in the Balkans the analysis conducted by the</figure>

			<table>Swiss State<lb/> Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO, 2007).<lb/> 56. See http://www.grameen-info.org/. More generally, on alliances and partnerships between a public aid<lb/> donor agency and private partners, see US Aid initiatives labeled The Global Development Alliance:<lb/> http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_partnerships/gda/report2006.html<lb/> 57. See http://www.omidyar.net/<lb/> banks from other emerging economies. These numbers are particularly important in low income<lb/> countries where 47 per cent of foreign banks in terms of numbers and 27 per cent in terms of<lb/> assets are owned by other foreign banks from developing countries (IMF, 2007).<lb/></table>

			<p>With emerging countries becoming emerging donors, identifying banks operating<lb/> overseas could be a positive dialogue in which to engage, both with &quot; emerged &quot; donors and<lb/> international banks. International NGOs such as the Netherlands based BankTrack 58 , involved in<lb/> tracking sustainable bank lending, has already started to address the growing role of emerging<lb/> markets based banks, new power players in development finance. In this regard, more<lb/> systematic analysis could complete BIS efforts to track lending operations from major emerging<lb/> countries&apos; banks, particularly those based in countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India and<lb/> China.<lb/> Another important issue, related to bank lending in developing countries, are related to<lb/> Basel II rules obliging foreign banks to use risk sensitive models to determine the amount of<lb/> capital to be allocated for different types of borrowers. Many studies have underlined the<lb/> potential negative impacts of such new rules on development finance, private bank lending from<lb/> OECD developed countries to developing countries and private bank lending within the<lb/> developing countries themselves. For these countries, Basel II can raise the costs of and reduce<lb/> access to external financing, inducing more expensive and rationed credit to borrowers perceived<lb/> as higher risk, such as low income countries or small and medium size enterprises. Importantly,<lb/> Basel II may also exacerbate fluctuations in the availability of external financing, an unfortunate<lb/> outcome, given that developing countries already suffer from volatile capital flows<lb/> 59 . Stepping<lb/> up collaboration with private banks might be a way of alleviating the impact of these new<lb/> banking rules for asset allocation, in particular in the lower income countries.<lb/> It is also important to stress this issue regarding the increasing presence in developing<lb/> countries not only of OECD foreign banks but also of foreign banks from other developing<lb/> countries. According to one estimate, using a large dataset on banking sector foreign direct<lb/> investment in developing countries (<ref type="biblio">Van Horen, 2007</ref>; and for the determinants of locations and<lb/> competitive advantages see Claessens and Van <ref type="biblio">Horen, 2007</ref>), 27 per cent of all foreign banks in<lb/> developing countries are owned by a bank from another developing country. This presence is<lb/> particularly striking in low income countries: in sub-Saharan Africa it is above all South Asian<lb/> and other sub-Saharan African banks that are present. This is a potential segment of bank<lb/> lending and bank activity within a developing country that could be considered when aid donors<lb/> are looking for public private partnerships in development finance.<lb/></p>

			<figure>One might envisage the creation of a Prize in Development Finance that would reward<lb/> best practices of public and private partnerships in the field. The OECD Global Forum on<lb/> Development could host such a prize, as it intends to strengthen the dialogue between aid<lb/> donors and private actors working on development issues and investing in developing countries.<lb/> The objective of the OECD Development Finance Prize would be to underline already existing<lb/> 58.
