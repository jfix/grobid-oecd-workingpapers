            <figDesc>Lancée dans le cadre d&apos;un projet plus vaste consacré à la santé mentale dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, la<lb/> série de profils « Santé mentale : profils d&apos;analyse » (Mental Health Analysis Profiles -MHAP) vise à<lb/> décrire de manière simple et détaillée les systèmes de santé mentale des pays de l&apos;OCDE. Ces profils, qui<lb/> étayeront les examens et les réflexions qui seront menés, feront le point sur la situation d&apos;un pays donné<lb/> dans le domaine de la santé mentale. Les profils MHAP sont indépendants les uns des autres mais suivent<lb/> le même modèle : il est donc possible, et recommandé, de les utiliser pour procéder à des comparaisons<lb/> entre pays.<lb/> L&apos;histoire récente de la santé mentale en Italie a été marquée par la désinstitutionalisation, comme en<lb/> témoignent les réformes importantes entreprises au cours des dernières années : en abandonnant peu à peu<lb/> le placement traditionnel en hôpital psychiatrique (manicomi) à partir de la fin des années 1970 et en<lb/> procédant depuis peu à la fermeture des hôpitaux psychiatriques judiciaires (Ospedali Psichiatrici<lb/> Giudiziari -OPG), l&apos;Italie est parvenue progressivement à intégrer des services de santé mentale dans les<lb/> services de proximité. La priorité n&apos;est plus accordée à la sécurité et à l&apos;isolement des patients souffrant de<lb/> troubles mentaux, mais plutôt aux besoins des patients, à leur insertion sociale et à leur réadaptation.</figDesc>

Local and regional collaboration are also pointed out as key elements for improving<lb/> equity of access to mental health services and overall quality, with the Departments of Mental Health being<lb/> responsible for organising consultation roundtables (tavolo di concertazione locale) on priority objectives.<lb/> The Local Health Authorities also were required to be equipped with their own Local Plan for Mental<lb/> Health (Piano di Azione Locale per la Salute Mentale) obtained through consultation with all local actors.<lb/> However, at the moment only a few regions have formally included the 2008 National Strategic Plan for<lb/> Mental Health into their regional planning.<lb/> 20.<lb/> The last national mental health strategy was released in January 2013 – the Italian Mental Health<lb/> Action Plan (IMHAP) (Linee di Azioni Nazionale per la Salute Mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2013) (see<lb/> section 6.2 for further information).<lb/> 21.<lb/> Although the core of mental health strategies are settled within national mental health plans,<lb/> every two years a National Health Plan (Piano Sanitario Nazionale) is released by the Ministry of Health<lb/> with a special section devoted to mental health as a priority area – as did, for example, the National Health<lb/> Plan 2006-2008 (Ministry of Health</figDesc>

The aim of the S.E.M.E.<lb/> project is to determine the prevalence of severe mental illness in Italy by gathering data from<lb/> 22 Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) (Centro Salute Mentale – CSM) across 15 regions in<lb/> Italy.<lb/> 44.<lb/> During the first year of implementation, 17.7 individuals per 100 000 population were treated for<lb/> a severe mental health problem within the 22 CMHCs selected. This figure, however, is likely to<lb/> underestimate the actual prevalence of severe mental illness within the population, in that it does not take<lb/> into account patients treated by private mental health specialists, patients hospitalised within psychiatric<lb/> wards in general hospitals, or patients who are not receiving any treatment. Psychotic disorders, including<lb/> schizophrenia, represent the majority of cases (40%), followed by bipolar disorder (30%), major depressive<lb/> disorder (19%) and nervous anorexia. Data from the first year of the implementation also show that 48% of<lb/> patients with severe mental illness have a low level of education (&lt; 8 years of education), 48% live with<lb/> their families, 40% are unemployed, and 87% live in very poor or modest economic conditions.

The movie is based on the true story of Franco Basaglia and his experience in two mental hospitals,<lb/> Gorizia and Trieste, where the process of closing all the mental hospitals in Italy began. The object of the movie is to<lb/> provide an overview of the changing approach towards mental illness that eventually led to the approval of Law 180 in<lb/> 1978.<lb/> The Department of Mental Health in Trieste consulted on the preparation of the script by defining the historical<lb/> context and assessing the scientific contents of the movie. The movie is currently available with English subtitles, and it<lb/> has already won 3 international Prizes (Shanghai, Monte Carlo and Rome Film Festivals) for its ability to address the<lb/> issues of stigma and prejudice.</figDesc>

Since its establishment, the programme has implemented a<lb/> vast range of activities, including: the establishment of institutional networks within regions; training<lb/> programmes for operators within regional mental health facilities; integration plans for mentally disordered<lb/> people into the labour market; and the development of a comprehensive information system. Whilst some<lb/> regions – Lazio, Piemonte, Puglia, Toscana and Umbria – were part of the programme since its inception,<lb/> other regions have joined later, such as Veneto, Campania and Sardegna in 2010, Marche in 2011 and<lb/> Molise in 2012.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Organisation of mental health services in the city of Trieste<lb/> The organisation of psychiatric services in the city of Trieste (201 814 inhabitants) has beentransformed since<lb/> 1971, following the activities of Franco Basaglia and his team and resulted in the closure of the San Giovanni<lb/> psychiatric hospital in 1980 along with the setting up of a network of community-based services. This model of<lb/> community-based mental health services has been implemented acrossthe whole Region Friuli Venezia Giulia (1 217<lb/> 864 population) as a regional model, focussed on &quot; strong &quot; comprehensive 24 hour Community Mental Health Centres,<lb/> equippedto respondto the most severe conditions and psychiatric episodes and to support clients in their ordinary life in<lb/> a view of recovery and social inclusion.

            <figDesc>Forensic mental health<lb/> 126.<lb/> Since the mid-1970s, &quot; Judiciary Psychiatric Hospitals &quot; (Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari – OPG,<lb/> forensic inpatient units) have replaced the former criminal asylums in Italy. Despite the aim of Law<lb/> Basaglia to close all former mental hospitals in 1978, the protection and health care of mentally disordered<lb/> offenders was disregarded by Law 180. As a consequence, forensic inpatient units established in 1975 were<lb/> kept open and remained more or less unchanged. There are currently 6 forensic inpatient units in Italy: the<lb/> Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (Sicilia); the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of<lb/> Reggio Emilia (Emilia Romagna); the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Montelupo Fiorentino (Toscana);<lb/> the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Castiglione delle Stiviere (Lombardia); the Judiciary Psychiatric<lb/> Hospital of Napoli (Campania) and the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Aversa (Campania). Due to the<lb/> implementation of Law 9 (see below) and the current process of closure of all OPGs, the number of<lb/> inmates decreased from 1 378 in July 2011 to 972 in June 2012, and the figure is continuing to fall.<lb/> 127.<lb/> The Italian Penal Code (hereafter p.c.) is a binary code, requiring detention for &quot; sane &quot; offenders<lb/> and security measures for mentally disabled people. As established by Art. 88 and 89 p.c., offenders are<lb/> not criminally liable if, at the moment of the offence, they were not capable of &quot; understanding and intent &quot;<lb/> (capacità di intendere e di volere) because of mental impairment. Inmates who experienced mental health<lb/> impairment during the execution of the sentence (Art. 148 p.c.), people with a severe mental handicap<lb/> (Art. 111 D.P.R. 230/2000) and people with partial mental disorder (Art. 219) are also eligible for being<lb/> detained in an OPG, upon verification that they are socially dangerous (Art. 203 p.c.). Under Art. 222 p.c.,<lb/> security measures consist in at least 2, 5 or 10 years detention in Judiciary Psychiatric Hospitals<lb/> (depending on the severity of the crime committed), after which, under Art. 208 p.c., the patient is subject<lb/> to re-examination of his/her social dangerousness by the surveillance judge, rather than being<lb/> automatically discharged after the sentence is served, as is the case for sane inmates.<lb/> 128.<lb/> As of July 2011, the legal status of patients was as follows: 534 patients declared criminally<lb/> irresponsible and involuntarily placed in an OPG under section 222 of the Penal Code; 338 patients whose<lb/> provisional placement in an OPG had been ordered under section 206 of the Penal Code (Temporary<lb/> Security Measures); 68 sentenced prisoners requiring psychiatric care placed in the OPG under section 148<lb/> of the Penal Code; 364 patients declared partially criminally irresponsible and placed in a &quot; care and<lb/> detention centre &quot; (Casa di Cura e Custodia) under section 219 of the Penal Code; and 45 patients declared<lb/> mentally handicapped under section 111 c5 DPR 230/00 of the Penal Code (see Figure 21).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In 2010, the European Council for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) published a Report<lb/> summarising the outcomes of the inspections conducted into some security facilities in Italy, including<lb/> prisons, mental health wards within general hospitals and OPGs (Council of Europe, 2010). The Council<lb/> visited the OPG of Aversa and concluded that &quot; [t]he gravity of the situation observed at the Aversa OPG<lb/> calls for a more determined response from the Italian authorities, preferably at national level &quot; (Council of<lb/> Europe, 2010:62). Other visits into OPGs were conducted in 1992, 1996 and 2000 and reported more or<lb/> less the same situation.<lb/> 132.<lb/> Under Art. 82 of the Italian Constitution, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the<lb/> efficacy and the efficiency of the National Health Service (Commissione Parlamentare di Inchiesta<lb/> sull&apos;efficacia e l&apos;efficienza del Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) (hereafter the &quot; Commission &quot; ), was set up in<lb/> 2008 to monitor the quality of both public and private health services provided in the whole territory and to<lb/> control the actual implementation of health policies, thus providing the Parliament and the Public<lb/> Administration with comprehensive indications on the state of health services provision in Italy. The<lb/> Commission was composed of 20 senators and 1 President and holds, for the entire period of the legislature<lb/> (5 years), the same powers and limitations conferred on the legal authorities. Following the above-<lb/>mentioned recommendations of the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 2008a),<lb/> part of the work undertaken by the Commission was devoted to the investigation of the operation of Italy&apos;s<lb/> OPGs. The Commission organised regular unannounced on-the-spot inspections during the years 2008-<lb/>2011 into each of the 6 OPGs and carried out interviews with OPG directors and with consumer<lb/> associations (such as Psychiatric Democracy – Democrazia Psichiatrica and StopOPG).</figDesc>
