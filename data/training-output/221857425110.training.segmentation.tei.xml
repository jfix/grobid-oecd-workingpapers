			<front>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Improving the functioning of the Slovenian labour market <lb/>Labour market outcomes have improved markedly in the past years as the beneficial effects of the <lb/>economic upswing were reinforced by important structural reforms.With the economy on the verge of a <lb/>severe economic downturn, it is important to avoid alleviating measures that adversely affect the <lb/>functioning of the labour market in the long run. Moreover, several structural challenges remain which <lb/>require further reform efforts. Firstly, to raise labour force participation of the elderly the pension system <lb/>needs to be reformed by removing incentives for early retirement and facilitating gradual exits from the <lb/>labour force. Secondly, to increase employment rates of younger age cohorts, the length of tertiary studies <lb/>needs to be reduced by strengthening incentives for rapid graduation. Moreover, potential negative <lb/>employment effects associated with the relatively high minimum wage compared to the average wage <lb/>should be avoided. Thirdly, to combat increasing labour market dualism, employment protection <lb/>legislation on regular work contracts needs to be eased once the current economic crisis subsides and the <lb/>preferential treatment of student work should be phased out. This Working Paper relates to the 2009 OECD <lb/>Economic Survey of the Slovenia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/slovenia). <lb/>JEL classification: J21; J22; J32; J26. <lb/>Keywords: Slovenia ; labour force participation ; labour market dualism. <lb/>*********** <lb/>Améliorer le fonctionnement du marché de travail de la Slovénie <lb/>La situation du marché du travail s&apos;est nettement améliorée ces dernières années, sous l&apos;effet cumulé <lb/>du redressement économique et d&apos;importantes réformes structurelles. Face à la menace imminente d&apos;un <lb/>ralentissement économique grave, il est essentiel d&apos;éviter toute mesure de soutien qui pourrait nuire au bon <lb/>fonctionnement du marché du travail à terme. Des efforts restent en outre à fournir en matière de réformes <lb/>pour remédier à certaines difficultés structurelles. Tout d&apos;abord, le régime de retraite doit être remanié afin <lb/>d&apos;améliorer le taux d&apos;activité des travailleurs âgés, en éliminant les incitations à la retraite anticipée et en <lb/>facilitant la sortie progressive de la population active. Ensuite, pour stimuler l&apos;emploi des jeunes, il faut <lb/>réduire la durée des études supérieures, en renforçant les mesures d&apos;incitation à l&apos;obtention rapide des <lb/>diplômes, et éviter par ailleurs les effets potentiellement négatifs sur l&apos;emploi du niveau relativement élevé <lb/>du salaire minimum. Enfin, pour lutter contre le dualisme croissant du marché du travail, on devra <lb/>assouplir la législation sur la protection de l&apos;emploi pour les contrats de travail réguliers une fois la crise <lb/>économique dissipée, et il convient aussi de supprimer progressivement le traitement préférentiel appliqué <lb/>à l&apos;emploi des étudiants.

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SLOVENIAN LABOUR MARKET <lb/>by <lb/>Isabell Koske 1 <lb/>Labour market performance has been improving… <lb/>1. <lb/>Along with the strong economic growth of recent years, labour market performance has improved <lb/>markedly. Between 2003 and mid-2008 the employment rate increased by 5 percentage points to <lb/>around 69%. With labour force participation roughly constant throughout this period the rise in aggregate <lb/>employment was mainly reflected in a fall in the unemployment rate which came down from 6.7% in 2003 <lb/>to 4.2% in mid-2008. In 2007 Slovenia had the lowest unemployment among the Central and East <lb/>European OECD countries (Figure 1, panel A). Estimates of the NAIRU – the rate of unemployment <lb/>consistent with non-accelerating inflation – suggest that the fall in unemployment was mostly cyclical with <lb/>the unemployment rate falling substantially below the estimated level of the NAIRU, especially in 2007 <lb/>and 2008 (Figure 2 and Annex 1). This is in line with relatively high wage growth in these years. 2 <lb/>Nonetheless, the beneficial effects of the economic upswing seem to have been reinforced by important <lb/>structural reforms (Box 1) that have been associated with a gradual decline in the NAIRU over time. <lb/>2. <lb/>Although aggregate employment is close to the OECD average of 70%, 3 large disparities remain <lb/>across different age groups and across groups of different educational attainment. While employment rates <lb/>are around the OECD average for men aged 30 to 49 and well above the OECD average for women in that <lb/>age group, they are very low for the elderly, reflecting low participation rates (Figure 1, panel B). In 2007 <lb/>only 47% of those aged 55 to 59 and only 17% of those aged 60 to 64 participated in the labour force <lb/>compared with OECD averages of respectively 66% and 43%. The low participation of older age cohorts is <lb/>mirrored in low effective age retirement ages of around 60⅔ years for men and 57½ years for women. 4 <lb/>1. <lb/>Economist in the Economics Department. This Working Paper incorporates Chapter 3 of the OECD&apos;s 2009 <lb/>Survey of Slovenia which was prepared under the responsibility of the Economic and Development <lb/>Review Committee. The author is grateful for the valuable comments received on earlier drafts of this text <lb/>from Andrew Dean, Bob Ford, Pierre Beynet and other colleagues in the Economics Department, as well as <lb/>for discussions with officials from the Slovenian government. Special thanks go to Desney Erb of the <lb/>OECD Economics Department for statistical assistance. <lb/>2. <lb/>Private sector gross earnings rose by around 6½ per cent in 2007 and 8½ per cent in 2008, compared with <lb/>an average of 3½ per cent per annum over the period 2003-06 when the unemployment rate was close to <lb/>the NAIRU. <lb/>3. <lb/>The relatively high participation rate is partly due to the structure of the Slovenian population with almost <lb/>no foreigners and relatively few low-skilled persons. ECB (2008) argue that although the observed <lb/>Slovenian participation rate is above the euro area average it would be clearly below that average if <lb/>Slovenia were to have the same population composition as the euro area as a whole. <lb/>4. <lb/>The numbers refer to persons who retired in 2007 under general and special regulation and are taken from <lb/>the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance of Slovenia (ZPIZ, 2008). <lb/></body>

Recent labour market reforms <lb/>Slovenia has implemented several reforms of the labour code in recent years aimed at increasing the flexibility of <lb/>its labour market. This was necessary not least to improve the country&apos;s ability to cope with asymmetric shocks in the <lb/>euro area that cannot be dealt with by the common monetary policy. This box briefly outlines the main reforms that <lb/>have been undertaken since 1997, when the OECD&apos;s only other Economic Survey of Slovenia was published. <lb/>Regulation of employment contracts <lb/>In 1998, amendments to the Employment and Insurance against Unemployment Act (EIUA) licensed the <lb/>operation of temporary work agencies and thus contributed notably to a liberalisation of temporary employment. More <lb/>flexibility in the area of regular employment was introduced by the 2003 Employment Relationships Act (ERA) which <lb/>shortened notice periods, reduced the levels of severance pay and relaxed regulations on collective dismissals, but put <lb/>additional restrictions on temporary work. More recently, the establishment of specialised temporary work agencies <lb/>was made easier through amendments to the EIUA adopted in 2006. <lb/>1 The 2007 amendments to the ERA expanded <lb/>the possibilities for fixed-term contracts, <lb/>2 exempted contracts for project work from the two-year time limit for temporary <lb/>employment, and facilitated the termination of regular work contracts by further shortening notice periods in case of <lb/>termination due to business reasons (to 30 days for less than 5 years of tenure, 45 days for at least 5 years of tenure, <lb/>60 days for at least 15 years of tenure and 120 days for at least 25 years of tenure) and exempting employers from the <lb/>obligation to pay severance pay if the employer or the Employment Service offers the employee an employment <lb/>contract with another employer during the notice period and the employee concludes this contract. The amount of <lb/>severance pay remained unchanged at one-fifth of the average monthly wage during the last three months before the <lb/>termination of the contract for each year of employment, if the worker has been employed for more than one and up to <lb/>five years (one-fourth if employed for 5 to 15 years and one-third if employed for more than 15 years). <lb/>Duration and level of unemployment benefits <lb/>The amended EIUA adopted in 1998 cut the potential period of entitlement to unemployment benefits for some <lb/>groups of the unemployed (to 3 months for insurance up to 5 years, to 6 months for insurance of 5 to 15 years, to <lb/>9 months for insurance of 15 to 25 years and to 12 months [18 months if the insured person is older than 50 years and <lb/>24 months if the person is older than 55 years] for insurance of over 25 years). 3 In 2006, stricter rules were introduced <lb/>regarding the obligations of unemployed: they are obliged to actively search for employment and after three <lb/>(six) months of unemployment they have to accept a job offer from the Employment Service for which the education is <lb/>one level (two levels) below the education level of the unemployed person. If the unemployed person does not comply <lb/>with these rules the cash benefit is cut in half for a period of two months. The level of unemployment benefits has not <lb/>changed since the last Economic Survey and amounts to 70% of the average monthly salary received in the 12 months <lb/>prior to unemployment for the first three months and to 60% in the subsequent months. The minimum (maximum) <lb/>benefit is equal to 0.46 (1.37) times the minimum wage. Unemployment assistance was abolished in 2006. Instead, the <lb/>unemployed can get means-tested social assistance after the expiration of unemployment benefits. <lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>Labour taxation <lb/>The rates of payroll tax were gradually reduced between 2006 and 2008 and the tax was completely phased out <lb/>in January 2009, considerably reducing unit labour costs. Furthermore, reforms of the personal income tax led to a <lb/>reduction in the number and level of tax rates. In 2005, the number of tax rates was cut from six (from 17% to 50%) to <lb/>five (from 16% to 50%) and in 2007, the number was further reduced to three (16%, 27% and 41%). In 2008, the level <lb/>of general and special personal income tax allowances was raised, lowering the tax burden, in particular for low <lb/>income earners, and special allowances were reduced and simplified. <lb/>Wage bargaining <lb/>In 2006, the Collective Agreements Act came into force and introduced significant changes to the system of <lb/>collective bargaining. The Act regulates the parties, scope and hierarchy of collective agreements, and the procedure <lb/>of conclusion and termination of the collective agreement as well as its validity. The Act does not provide for the <lb/>mandatory conclusion of collective agreements or the mandatory content, nor does it determine the types of collective <lb/>agreements and the level of their conclusion. The main novelties introduced by the Act include the principle of <lb/>voluntary conclusion, the possibility of subsequent accession to concluded collective agreements, the restriction of the <lb/>validity of collective agreements to the parties that concluded it or their members, and the regulation that the collective <lb/>agreement that is most favourable to workers should apply if an employer is bound by more than one collective <lb/>agreement of the same type. Wages are limited downwards by the Minimum Wage Act, introduced in 2006. According <lb/>to the Act the minimum wage is determined once a year by the Minister of Labour based on the forecast of consumer <lb/>price inflation, after consulting the social partners. <lb/>Active labour market policy <lb/>Slovenia&apos;s expenditure on active labour market policies (ALMP) amounted to around 0.22% of gross domestic <lb/>product (GDP) in 2008, part of which is financed by the European Social Fund. At the end of 2006, new guidelines for <lb/>ALMP were adopted within the Active Labour Market Policy Programme for the period 2007–13. The programme <lb/>envisages measures in four areas: i) counselling and assistance for employment; ii) training and education; <lb/>iii) promotion of employment and self-employment; and iv) programmes for increasing social inclusion. The programme <lb/>is complemented by action plans which are confirmed by the government for each budget period. New ALMP <lb/>envisaged for 2009 include a subsidy programme to promote employment of young people with tertiary education and <lb/>of older and long-term unemployed persons; the promotion of part-time work; and education and training programmes <lb/>for unemployed who wish to become self-employed and for employees of micro and small firms and of firms with <lb/>subsidised full-time employment. <lb/>Organisation of working time <lb/>Some measures have been taken to facilitate the reconciliation of work and private life, for example by granting <lb/>parents the right to work fewer hours. The 2007 amendments to the ERA introduced possibilities for longer overtime <lb/>work and, so as to make part-time work more attractive to employers, defined the principle of proportionality of rights of <lb/>part-time employees with respect to the number of working hours. The amended Prevention of Illegal Work and <lb/>Employment Act opened employment possibilities for short-term and small work by considering it as declared work. <lb/>4 <lb/>Migration <lb/>In 2001, a new Employment and Work of Aliens Act came into force, providing for a comprehensive regulation of <lb/>all forms of work by foreigners (excluding citizens of all EU member countries) in a single Act. The Act specifies <lb/>different types of work permits 5 according to the aim and the duration of employment and regulates the number of <lb/>foreigners allowed to enter the Slovenian labour market (the annual quota is set by the government, though it may not <lb/>exceed 5% of the actively working population). In 2005, conditions were tightened for self-employed foreigners (the <lb/>requirement of one year of prior residence in Slovenia was introduced) whereas they were relaxed for seasonal <lb/>workers. In 2007, the Act was amended to simplify procedures for workers from occupations facing labour shortages. <lb/>__________________ <lb/>1. Such agencies can now acquire the right to provide temporary work only by entry in the registry of agencies providing temporary <lb/>work and do not have to conclude a concession contract as other employment agencies have to do. <lb/>2. In particular, the amendments expanded the possibilities for temporary work contracts to cases where none of the applicants <lb/>fulfils the required conditions for the job, employment of managers and employment on projects. <lb/>3. The cut in benefit duration had a sizable positive effect on the exit rate out of unemployment at all lengths of the unemployment <lb/>benefit duration (Ours, J.C. van and M. Vodopivec [2006], &quot; How Shortening the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits <lb/>Affects the Duration of Unemployment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment &quot; , Journal of Labor Economics, Vol. 24, No. 2, <lb/>University of Chicago Press, Chicago), though it did not reduce job match quality (Ours, J.C. van and M. Vodopivec [2008], &quot; Does <lb/>Reducing Unemployment Insurance Generosity Reduce Job Match Quality &quot; , Journal of Public Economics, Vol. 92, No. 3-4, <lb/>Elsevier BV, Amsterdam). <lb/></body>

Short-term work is unpaid work in micro firms or private institutions by the spouse of the owner or a person to whom he/she is <lb/>related to in the first degree, and which lasts 40 hours a month at the most. Small work lasts not more than 20 hours a week and <lb/>not more than 40 hours a month, while payment does not exceed 50% of the minimum wage, and is carried out by a person who <lb/>is not in full-time employment, who does not pursue an independent activity and who does not receive a pension. <lb/>5. Three different types of work permits exist: personal work permits, employment permits and permits for work. A personal work <lb/>permit is issued on the application of a foreigner who has a temporary or permanent residence permit and who has lived in <lb/>Slovenia for at least one year, and grants free access to the Slovenian labour market. An employment permit is issued upon the <lb/>request of an employer, provided that he meets all necessary conditions, including the provision that hiring a foreigner does not <lb/>adversely affect the domestic unemployment situation. A permit for work allows a foreigner to work in Slovenia for a limited period <lb/>of time defined in advance based on the purpose for which the permit is issued (e.g. seasonal work, managerial work). <lb/>3. <lb/>The employment rates of those aged 15 to 24 are also lower than in the average OECD country <lb/>(Figure 1, panel B), reflecting a high participation of youth in education and a longer duration of education. <lb/>The unemployment rate of those aged 15 to 24 has fallen considerably in the past years, coming down from <lb/>15% in 2003 to below 10% in 2008 (Figure 1, panel C). Particularly lower-skilled youth (without upper <lb/>secondary education) benefited from this development. Favourable economic conditions as well as active <lb/>policy measures to integrate the youth into the labour market are the main factors behind the decline in <lb/>youth unemployment. In addition, the fact that smaller generations of young people are entering the labour <lb/>market due to the ageing process may have contributed to this development. While unemployment is still <lb/>much more prevalent among the youth than among other age groups, Slovenia performs better than many <lb/>other OECD economies (Figure 1, panel D). <lb/>4. <lb/>Along with the decline in overall unemployment, the pool of long-term unemployed has also <lb/>been reduced in recent years. Past labour market reforms such as the tightening of eligibility criteria for <lb/>unemployment benefits and active labour market policies (ALMP) aimed at upgrading the skills of those <lb/>unemployed, who are unable to return directly from unemployment to a new job, are likely to have <lb/>contributed to this development (Box 1). Nonetheless, the share of long-term unemployed in total <lb/>unemployed remains well above the OECD average (Figure 1, panel E). As older workers benefited less <lb/>from the recent fall in long-term unemployment than other groups, they now account for a higher share of <lb/>long-term unemployed than before the economic upswing (Figure 1, panel F). <lb/>… but challenges remain <lb/>5. <lb/>The substantial and welcome progress in improving labour market outcomes notwithstanding, <lb/>challenges remain in specific areas. In the short term the main challenge will be to cope with rising <lb/>unemployment due to the global economic crisis. The government has adopted a number of measures to <lb/>safeguard jobs and contain the rise in unemployment within the fiscal package adopted in February 2009. <lb/>Whilst such initiatives are vital under current circumstances, it is important that they are well designed and <lb/>do not harm economic growth in the long run. In this respect, the subsidy scheme for shorter working <lb/>hours should be phased out once the crisis dissipates. In the meantime, eligibility should be temporary in <lb/>nature as is the case in several other OECD countries such as Germany (Box 2). Moreover, any measures <lb/>that are detrimental to the functioning of the labour market should be avoided. tightening the rules for <lb/>immigrant workers during the crisis in order to maintain jobs for Slovenian citizens would be the wrong <lb/>way to go as immigrant workers are needed in the longer run to address skill mismatches in the domestic <lb/>labour market. <lb/>6. <lb/>It is also important to look beyond the short-term horizon and reflect on the structural problems <lb/>of the labour market. As stressed by Høj et al. (2006), structural reforms are sometimes easier to <lb/>implement in times of economic crises because bad economic conditions make it clearer that existing <lb/>policies are no longer sustainable, either for individual citizens or for the economy. On the other hand, the <lb/>political opposition to reforms in certain specific labour market areas (for example, employment protection <lb/>legislation) is likely to be stronger during economic downturns as workers are already suffering from high <lb/>unemployment. It therefore seems expedient to proceed rapidly with reforms that are not costly under <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>current circumstances but have beneficial effects in the long run (such as a reform of the pension system) <lb/>while delaying reforms that face strong opposition due to the crisis until the next economic upswing. On <lb/>the whole, three main areas stand out where further reform is needed (by the importance of issues and <lb/>hence suggested priority for policy makers): <lb/>• Labour force participation rates among the elderly are very low by international standards.<lb/>• Despite recent increases, the employment rates of younger age cohorts remain relatively low, <lb/>partly reflecting a long time in completing education. <lb/> • The share of temporary employment has been rising quickly, especially among youth, which <lb/>risks creating a dual labour market.<lb/>Box 2. The German subsidy scheme for shorter working hours <lb/>The subsidy scheme for shorter working hours is meant to reduce the labour costs of companies that are in <lb/>temporary distress. Companies are eligible for the subsidy if they face a major drop in orders due to economic reasons <lb/>or extraordinary events, provided the drop in orders is temporary in nature. More than one-third of the employees must <lb/>lose at least 10% of their gross wage for the company to be eligible, though this condition is suspended from <lb/>February 2009 to December 2010 (instead, the subsidy can only be paid to employees who lose more than 10% of <lb/>their gross wage). The scheme can only be introduced if it is agreed in a collective agreement, a company agreement <lb/>or the working contract of the individual employee. If a work council is active in the company it also has to agree to the <lb/>implementation of the scheme. Employees participating in the scheme have to accept a cut in their monthly income as <lb/>the State only pays 60% of the forgone net wage (67% if the employee has children).* Contributions to pension, health <lb/>and care insurance are paid on 80% of the foregone income with the employers paying all of it, i.e. not only their share <lb/>but also the employees&apos; share (part of the payments are currently refunded as part of the government&apos;s fiscal stimulus <lb/>package). The maximum duration of eligibility is generally limited to 6 months, though it has recently been extended to <lb/>24 months for all employees that become eligible before the end of 2009. Since end 2008, the scheme may also be <lb/>used for workers of temporary work agencies. <lb/>_____________ <lb/>* Some collective agreements stipulate that the benefits paid by the State are to be extended by the employer. <lb/>Boosting the labour force participation of the elderly <lb/>7. <lb/>The employment rates of older persons have increased markedly over the past decade. The <lb/>increase was particularly strong for persons aged 55 to 59, owing to the effects of the 1999 pension reform <lb/>as well as to demographic effects as the early-retirement generation from the early 1990s is leaving this age <lb/>group. Between 1997 and 2008, the employment rate of this age group rose by around 17%, reaching <lb/>slightly more than 45% in the third quarter of 2008. However, despite this progress the employment rate is <lb/>still the third-lowest in the OECD (Figure 3). The employment rate of persons aged 60 to 64 is also <lb/>amongst the lowest in the OECD and, due to rising employment rates in many other OECD countries, has <lb/>even fallen further behind the OECD average in recent years. The low employment rates of older persons <lb/>are mirrored by a low effective retirement age (Figure 4). Men retire about three years earlier in Slovenia <lb/>than in the average OECD country whilst for women the difference is as much as five years. 5 The low <lb/>effective retirement age, together with rapid population ageing (Figure 5), puts pressure on the growth of <lb/>public expenditure for old-age pensions and at the same time limits the growth potential of the economy <lb/>through a shrinking labour force. To avoid these negative effects it is essential that steps are taken to boost <lb/>the labour force participation of the elderly. <lb/>5. <lb/>The effective retirement ages shown in Figure 3.4 are estimated based on Labour Force Survey (LFS) data <lb/>to be comparable across countries. The figures for Slovenia are somewhat higher than those published by <lb/>the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance of Slovenia (ZPIZ, 2008) which are based on the actual <lb/>age of the persons applying for pension benefits in a given year. A possible explanation for the difference <lb/>is that some persons are officially retired but continue working in the informal sector.

Average effective age of retirement versus the official age <lb/>1 <lb/>2002-07 <lb/>1. <lb/>The average effective age of retirement is defined as the average age of exit from the labour force during a 5-year period. <lb/>Labour force (net) exits are estimated by taking the difference in the participation rate for each 5-year age group (40 and over) <lb/>at the beginning of the period and the rate for the corresponding age group aged 5-years older at the end of the period. The <lb/>official age corresponds to the age at which a pension can be received irrespective of whether a worker has a long insurance <lb/>record of years of contributions.

First, so-called &quot; pull &quot; factors, associated primarily with financial incentives embedded in public <lb/>pension and early retirement schemes, are &quot; pulling &quot; older workers into retirement and thus play an <lb/>important role in determining retirement decisions (e.g. Burniaux et al., 2003; Duval, 2003; Burtless, <lb/>2009). The decisions will be influenced by the age at which benefits can first be claimed, the generosity of <lb/>replacement rates and the accessibility of informal paths to early retirement through unemployment, <lb/>disability and long-term sickness insurance programmes. Second, so-called &quot; push &quot; factors, which <lb/>determine the available set of job opportunities open to older workers, are &quot; pushing &quot; workers into <lb/>retirement. The job opportunities depend for example on the age profile of labour costs relative to <lb/>productivity, employers&apos; perception about the capacities of older workers, and the strictness of <lb/>employment protection legislation (EPL). In addition, inflexible working time arrangement might be <lb/>pushing workers into early retirement (e.g. Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004). <lb/>9. <lb/>Past reforms of the labour code as well as the pension and education system have influenced <lb/>these push and pull factors in the right direction, leading to a significant improvement in both work <lb/>incentives and employment opportunities of older people. Examples include the gradual increase in the <lb/>statutory retirement age, the introduction of ALMP tailored specifically to the needs of the elderly such as <lb/>tax reliefs and exemptions from social security contributions for employers who hire older persons, and the <lb/>launch of a wide range of adult education programmes. However, the recent progress notwithstanding, <lb/>more needs to be done to encourage the elderly to remain active. In particular, retirement needs to be made <lb/>financially less attractive for older persons by further raising the statutory retirement age and adjusting the <lb/>financial incentives for early/late retirement, and the employment prospects of the elderly have to be <lb/>improved to ensure that those wishing to work longer also find appropriate jobs. <lb/>Further raising the retirement age <lb/>10. <lb/>Although the retirement age has already been raised by the pension reform adopted in 1999 there <lb/>is room for a further increase. The retirement age (the age at which persons can retire once they have <lb/>completed a pension qualifying period of 20 years) has been raised from 58 years to 63 years for men and <lb/>from 53 years to 61 years for women. While the increase was implemented rather quickly for men at a rate <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>of 6 months per year, the increase proceeds at just 4 months per year for women. 6 This implies that the <lb/>envisaged retirement age of 61 years will not be reached before 2023. The age limits for retirement with a <lb/>pension qualifying period of respectively 38 years (58 years of age) and 15 years (65 years of age) are also <lb/>raised by a mere 4 months per year. Several countries from Central and Eastern Europe, that had similarly <lb/>low retirement ages for women before they reformed their pension systems, implemented the changes at a <lb/>much faster pace. For example, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary and Latvia opted for an increase of 6 months <lb/>per year (12 months every second year in the case of Hungary) and in the Slovak Republic the retirement <lb/>age is even raised at a rate of 9 months per year. In light of the negative effects of the rapid ageing of the <lb/>Slovenian population on public finances, as well as potential economic growth, the increase in the <lb/>pensionable age for women should be phased-in faster. <lb/>11. <lb/>Even after the 1999 pension reform is fully phased-in, the pensionable age is low by OECD <lb/>standards (Figure 6). The majority of OECD countries currently have a retirement age of 65 years for both <lb/>genders and many of them are planning further increases along with gains in life expectancy. As life <lb/>expectancy in Slovenia is similar to other OECD countries, the lower retirement age implies a higher life <lb/>expectancy at retirement (particularly for women), putting strong pressure on pension costs on the one <lb/>hand and depriving the labour market of valuable resources on the other. The authorities should therefore <lb/>further increase the pensionable age for both genders. Once the increase has been phased-in and life <lb/>expectancy at the full pensionable age has reached a suitable level, additional increases in the pensionable <lb/>age should be linked to gains in life expectancy. The length of the pension qualifying period necessary to <lb/>retire at the minimum pensionable age should be raised accordingly. Moreover, the conditions for women <lb/>should be lined up over time with those for men. <lb/>Figure 6.

Where the retirement age is variable (e.g. depending on date of birth, number of <lb/>children raised, etc.), an average has been used. For the Slovak Republic, the retirement age of 62 will be reached in 2015 and <lb/>for Slovenia, the retirement age of 61 for women will be reached in 2023. <lb/>Source: Eurostat database (2009), Population and social conditions, January; and European Commission, MISSOC Tables 2007, <lb/>available at http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/missoc_tables_en.htm. <lb/>6. <lb/>The very gradual increase in the retirement age for women is typical of Slovenia&apos;s consensus based policy <lb/>approach which requires the agreement of the social partners on any legislative changes within the Economic <lb/>and Social Council. <lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>Removing incentives for early retirement <lb/>12. <lb/>A major novelty of the 1999 Pension and Disability Insurance Act (PDIA) was the introduction <lb/>of a comprehensive bonus/penalty system to reward deferral of retirement beyond the pensionable age and <lb/>penalise retirement prior to that age. However, the size of the bonuses and penalties appears relatively <lb/>small and might not provide sufficient incentives for remaining active. 7 In addition, the new Act provides <lb/>several possibilities for individuals to retire prior to the pensionable age without being subject to a penalty. <lb/>First, the pensionable age can be reduced progressively for persons with children (by 8 months for one <lb/>child, by 20 months for two, by 36 months for three and by another 20 months for each additional child). 8 <lb/>Second, for women who subscribe to compulsory pension insurance prior to the age of 18, the pensionable <lb/>age is lowered by the duration of insurance prior to that age. 9 Third, insured persons can retire before the <lb/>full pensionable age (provided they have completed a pension qualifying period of 20 years) under special <lb/>conditions such as long-term unemployment, redundancy programmes, programmes allowing the employer <lb/>to replace the insured person by a younger unemployed person, or the bankruptcy of the employer. <lb/>13. <lb/>Such options for early retirement considerably reduce the actual age at which persons retire. <lb/>Estimates of the median retirement age for the period 2002-07 based on Labour Force Survey data indicate <lb/>that half of all men (women) retired before the age of 56.3 (52.5), which is markedly below the full <lb/>pensionable age prevailing at that time. From a labour supply perspective, there is thus a large pool of still <lb/>relatively young persons whose human capital is lost due to very early retirement. While it appears <lb/>reasonable to allow for some flexibility in the retirement decision to be made by the individual based on <lb/>personal preferences, the design of the pension system must not encourage early retirement. The authorities <lb/>should therefore ensure that the penalties/bonuses for early/late retirement are actuarially neutral, so that <lb/>the change in pension benefits from working one additional year is equal to the entitlement earned in that <lb/>year and, conversely, retiring a year earlier reduces the pension benefit both by the entitlement that would <lb/>have been earned during the year and by an amount to reflect the longer duration for which the pension <lb/>must be paid. 10 The upper limit on the number of additional working years beyond the statutory retirement <lb/>age during which bonuses are paid (currently set at three years) should be abolished. In addition, the <lb/>possibility to retire prior to the pensionable age for special reasons such as the upbringing of children, <lb/>entry into compulsory insurance before the age of 18, long-term unemployment or bankruptcy of the <lb/>employer should be phased out. <lb/>14. <lb/>Raising the statutory retirement age and closing formal pathways to early retirement (or making <lb/>them less attractive) might encourage individuals to switch to informal early retirement schemes, such as <lb/>disability, long-term sickness and unemployment. Since the 1999 pension reform, the share of inactive <lb/>persons aged 50 to 64 who do not seek employment due to disability or sickness has risen markedly, from <lb/>6% in 2000 to 22% in 2007. The share has also increased for other age groups, albeit by a much smaller <lb/>amount, indicating that disability and sickness benefits are increasingly used by the elderly to withdraw <lb/>early from the labour force. The authorities should review the disability and long-term sickness insurance <lb/>schemes to ensure that eligibility conditions are sufficiently tight and adequately monitored. <lb/>7. <lb/>In 2007, 829 persons claimed a higher pension due to late retirement compared with an increase in the <lb/>number of total retirees by about 10 000 persons. <lb/>8. <lb/>The minimum (full) pensionable age may be reduced to 56 years (58 years) at most for women and to <lb/>58 years (60 years) at most for men. <lb/>9. <lb/>The minimum (full) pensionable age may be reduced to 55 years (58 years) at most. <lb/>10. <lb/>Queisser and Whitehouse (2006) calculate actuarial neutral bonuses/penalties for 19 OECD countries and <lb/>obtain values in the range of 6% to 9%. <lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>15. <lb/>Unemployment benefits by contrast are not yet widely used for the purpose of early retirement. In <lb/>mid-2008 the unemployment rate of 50-64 year-olds stood at around 3½ per cent, more than half a <lb/>percentage point below the aggregate rate. However, there is a risk that this pathway becomes more <lb/>popular in the future along with further increases in the retirement age and stricter controls on disability <lb/>and sickness benefit recipients. To prevent this from happening, the generosity of the scheme should be <lb/>reduced further for older people. Currently, older workers with an insurance history of 15 to 25 years are <lb/>eligible for benefits during respectively 18 months (if they are older than 50 years) and 24 months (if they <lb/>are older than 55 years) whereas workers below the age of 50 receive benefits for 12 months. As a result, <lb/>the incidence of unemployment benefits is highly skewed in favour of older workers. The authorities <lb/>should reduce the length of unemployment benefit duration for long-term unemployed older workers <lb/>towards the general length of 12 months, once the current economic crisis dissipates. <lb/>16. <lb/>Work decisions may also be influenced by the degree to which an individual&apos;s pension benefits <lb/>are linked to the entire working career in terms of length and level of earnings. If pension benefits are <lb/>calculated based on a finite number of best years, older workers might be encouraged to exit from the <lb/>workforce, particularly if they do not expect any further increases in earnings or have to accept earnings <lb/>cuts to stay employed. Since 2008, pension benefits in Slovenia are based on the 18 best consecutive years <lb/>(the assessment period had been gradually increased from 10 years in 2000 after the passage of the 1999 <lb/>PDIA). The link between pension benefits and working careers could be strengthened further by basing <lb/>benefits on full lifetime average earnings as is done in most OECD countries (OECD, 2007). <lb/>Making partial retirement more attractive <lb/>17. <lb/>Inflexible working time arrangements may discourage older workers from continuing to work <lb/>longer due to difficulties in reconciling work with family life. This may result in a cliff-edge pattern of <lb/>retirement with older workers shifting instantly from working full-time to not working at all (OECD, <lb/>2006a). Such an abrupt departure from the full-time career job may actually not be the preferred path to <lb/>retirement for many workers; they would prefer to gradually reduce their work commitments over a period <lb/>of time. Rigidities to a gradual exit from the labour market may result, first from barriers to part-time work <lb/>in general (as shown in panel A of Figure 7 those countries with a higher incidence of part-time <lb/>employment tend to have higher overall labour force participation of the elderly), and second from <lb/>constraints on the right to draw all or part of a pension while continuing to work at the same time. In <lb/>Slovenia, individuals are not allowed to be retired and work at the same time, though it is possible to retire <lb/>partially which means receiving half of one&apos;s pension and continue working half-time (or less). Yet, the <lb/>possibility of partial retirement is hardly used; at the end of 2007, only 184 persons retired in such a way <lb/>(IMAD, 2008a), which is less than 2% of new old-age pension recipients. <lb/>18. <lb/>Restrictions on part-time work in general are unlikely to be the main explanation for the low <lb/>number of partial retirees. Although the share of workers aged 50 to 64 working part-time falls short of the <lb/>levels seen in most OECD countries (Figure 7, panel B) and has not increased in recent years, the number <lb/>of such jobs has risen among other age groups, most notably the young (Figure 7, panel C), not least thanks <lb/>to some progress in liberalizing working-time arrangements (Box 1). 11 It thus seems more likely that <lb/>factors related to the partial retirement scheme itself are at the root of its low popularity. <lb/>19. <lb/>The rules on partial retirement are indeed such that the scheme does not appear very attractive. <lb/>First, the conditions for partial retirement are very tight as it requires the fulfilment of the conditions for <lb/>11. <lb/>The rise was particularly strong in 2003, which may be related to the acceleration in economic growth and, <lb/>in the case of women, to the right to work reduced hours introduced by the Parental Protection and Social <lb/>Benefit Act (IMAD, 2008a). Moreover, a large share of those aged 15 to 24 in part-time employment is <lb/>student workers. <lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>full retirement and the consent of the employer. Moreover, the partial retiree is allowed to work on a half-<lb/>time basis at the most and will receive one-half of the old-age pension to which he is entitled. Second, <lb/>partial retirement is financially not very attractive as the pension income is taxed as regular income <lb/>(although the pension already represents net income taxed through the translation of the gross pension <lb/>basis to the net pension basis) and the wage income is subject to social security contributions. Whilst the <lb/>contributions to pension insurance translate into a higher replacement rate upon full retirement, <lb/>contributions for health and unemployment insurance act essentially as a tax since individuals who meet <lb/>the criteria for retirement are not eligible for unemployment benefits and since health insurance <lb/>contributions for full retirees are paid for by the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance of Slovenia. <lb/>Figure 7.

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>20. <lb/>Although Slovenia is likely to benefit less from a relaxation of partial retirement conditions than <lb/>other OECD countries, still 11% of employed persons stated in the 2006 Labour Force Survey that they <lb/>would stay longer at work if more flexible working time arrangements were available (Figure 7, panel D). <lb/>The authorities should therefore allow people to receive wage and pension income at the same time. At the <lb/>very least, the rules for partial retirement should be relaxed and the tax disincentives should be phased out. <lb/>In particular, there is no need to demand the consent of the employer for partial retirement, if EPL is <lb/>sufficiently flexible (see below). While easing barriers to part-time work and partial retirement may lead to <lb/>an increase in the participation of older people, the net impact on effective labour supply will be smaller or <lb/>even negative since some workers, who prior to the change would have continued working full-time, will <lb/>also reduce their hours worked (e.g. Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004). <lb/>Raising the demand for older workers <lb/>21. <lb/>Whilst removing incentives for early retirement and facilitating gradual exits from the labour <lb/>force will help increase the labour supply of older workers, it does not guarantee that the increase in supply <lb/>is matched by a corresponding increase in demand. The demand for older workers may be limited due to <lb/>negative perceptions on the side of employers about the capacities of older workers to adapt to <lb/>technological or organisational changes and due to wage-setting practices that let labour costs rise more <lb/>steeply with age than productivity. These issues have to be addressed in order to ensure that those people <lb/>who wish to work longer also find appropriate jobs. <lb/>22. <lb/>To counter negative employer attitudes, several OECD countries have launched information <lb/>campaigns and introduced legislation that bans age discrimination in employment (see OECD, 2006a, <lb/>Table 5.1 for an overview on the adopted measures). The two approaches are complementary: age-<lb/>discrimination legislation may be less effective if not accompanied by information campaigns and <lb/>guidelines to help employers implement good practices and to make older workers aware of their rights; at <lb/>the same time, information campaigns and guidelines may not be very effective if not backed by sanctions <lb/>for discrimination on the grounds of age (OECD, 2006a). Slovenia banned age discrimination in 2003 <lb/>when the Employment Relationships Act was adopted. The legislation was amended in 2007 to define the <lb/>sanctions in more detail and to shift the burden of proof towards the employer. A special information <lb/>campaign to promote the employment of older workers is planned for 2009. The campaign should create <lb/>awareness of the benefits of an age-diverse workforce where older workers share the benefits of their <lb/>greater work experience with younger workers who in turn share their knowledge of new production <lb/>techniques and ways of working with older workers. Emphasising age diversity rather than pointing out the <lb/>needs of older workers reduces the risk that they become a stigmatised group. Prominent examples of <lb/>information campaigns include the UK Age Positive campaign and the Finnish information campaign that <lb/>was launched as part of the Finnish National Programme on Ageing Workers (see OECD, 2006a, Box 5.1 <lb/>and 6.5). <lb/>23. <lb/>Employers might also be reluctant to hire or retain older workers because they cost too much <lb/>relative to their productivity. Some OECD countries have started to tackle this issue by moving away from <lb/>seniority-based wage systems. Examples are Korea where the government has encouraged employers and <lb/>trade unions to adopt a peak-wage system where wages are downward flexible after a certain age in <lb/>exchange for greater job security and Sweden where wage-setting in the public sector has gradually shifted <lb/>from a seniority-based system to one based much more on individual qualification and performance <lb/>(OECD, 2006a). In Slovenia, the Employment Relations Act stipulates that wages must include a <lb/>supplement for the number of years of service, though the size of this seniority bonus can be determined <lb/>freely in collective agreements. <lb/>24. <lb/>A number of OECD countries have introduced wage subsidies aimed at aligning more closely <lb/>labour costs for older workers and productivity (see OECD, 2006a, Table 5.2 for an overview on wage <lb/>subsidy schemes in OECD countries). This is also the approach taken by Slovenia: employers who hire an <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>unemployed person older than 55 years who has been registered with the Employment Service for over <lb/>12 months or a registered unemployed person aged over 55 years with an occupation in oversupply are <lb/>exempt from social security contributions. It is welcome that the wage subsidies are not granted solely on <lb/>the basis of age but are more narrowly targeted at specific groups of older workers. As argued by OECD <lb/>(2006a), more narrowly targeted subsidies tend be more effective than subsidies for older workers in <lb/>general, as the latter may involve a substantial deadweight loss (as a large proportion of subsidised workers <lb/>would have been employed even without the subsidy) and substitution effects (as subsidised jobs lead to <lb/>the loss of jobs for other groups of workers ineligible for the subsidy). Moreover, subsidies granted solely <lb/>on the basis of age may again lead to stigmatisation and reinforce negative attitudes on the side of <lb/>employers. <lb/>25. <lb/>Whilst reforming wage-setting practices to reflect individual performance and providing <lb/>employment subsidies to lower the cost of employing older workers, a closer match between productivity <lb/>and costs can also be achieved by helping older workers to acquire new skills and update existing ones so <lb/>as to raise their productivity as discussed below. <lb/>Encouraging participation in lifelong learning <lb/>26. <lb/>Due to organisational and technological change, as well as the ongoing structural shift from <lb/>manufacturing to services, job requirements are constantly changing. As a result, the skills of workers risk <lb/>becoming obsolete, unless they continuously acquire new skills and upgrade existing ones (Behaghel and <lb/>Greenan, 2005). Participation in lifelong learning can therefore considerably enhance the employability of <lb/>older workers. 12 In addition, job-related training is associated with a higher wage level (Bassanini et al., <lb/>2005) and thus increased incentives to remain active and defer retirement. Providing workers of all ages <lb/>with good access to vocational training and lifelong learning programmes can therefore help to raise the <lb/>employment rates of the elderly. At the same time, workers are more likely to engage in training activities <lb/>if the pension system encourages them to keep working at older ages as this increases the number of years <lb/>available to recoup the returns on investment in training by both workers and employers. 13 As shown in <lb/>panel A of Figure 8, there is a significant positive correlation across countries between the incidence of <lb/>training for older workers relative to younger ones and the average employment rate of older workers. 14 <lb/>27. <lb/>Participation in lifelong learning activities is relatively high in Slovenia (Figure 8, panel B). <lb/>Nevertheless, some scope for further improvements remains, as demonstrated by several other OECD <lb/>countries such as Switzerland and the Nordic countries which have even higher participation rates. More <lb/>importantly, in Slovenia, the share of the population participating in lifelong learning rapidly decreases <lb/>with age which may to some extent reflect fewer expected years left in the workforce and hence fewer <lb/>years to regain the returns on investment in training. While this phenomenon is common across countries, <lb/>the decline is faster in Slovenia than in other OECD countries (Figure 9, panel A). The suggested further <lb/>increase in the pensionable age as well as the removal of incentives for early retirement should make <lb/>participation in training activities more attractive, especially at higher ages. <lb/>12. <lb/>Cross country evidence for the positive employment effects of adult learning is provided by OECD (2004). <lb/>13. <lb/>This is supported by Bassanini et al. (2005) reporting a negative correlation between the rate of training for <lb/>older workers (relative to younger ones) and the effective tax on continued work (which is likely to be <lb/>exogenous to training behaviour). <lb/>14. <lb/>As discussed, the causality can run in both directions with higher participation in training raising the <lb/>employment rates of the elderly and higher employment rates encouraging higher participation in training. <lb/></body>

Several initiatives have been taken in the <lb/>past to promote lifelong learning in Slovenia. In 2006, the National Professional Qualifications Act was <lb/>amended, introducing a system of recognition of non-formal and informal training. Under the Act, <lb/>individuals can obtain a certificate demonstrating that they have the professional or vocational <lb/>competencies necessary to exercise a profession based on either direct demonstration of knowledge, skills <lb/>and competencies, or based on documents and other proof collected by the applicant. In 2007, the <lb/>Resolution on the National Programme of Higher Education of the Republic of Slovenia 2007-10 was <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>adopted, which envisages an increase in the share of population participating in lifelong learning activities <lb/>and the development of programmes for employees, unemployed and inactive persons who wish to return <lb/>to tertiary education. Measures in the area of lifelong learning are also envisaged in the Social Agreement <lb/>for the period 2007-09 and the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development for the period <lb/>2007-13. The implementation of the Lifelong Learning Strategy adopted in 2007 is still hindered by the <lb/>failure to develop an associated operational programme. <lb/>29. <lb/>To further encourage the population to participate in lifelong learning, the inter-ministerial <lb/>working group which was set up to discuss the implementation of the Lifelong Learning Strategy should <lb/>quickly develop a plan to put the strategy into action. Given the wide range of adult education programmes <lb/>currently available, it is also important to evaluate their impact on labour market outcomes. So far, such <lb/>empirical assessments of specific programmes are rare. As stressed for example by Martin and Grubb <lb/>(2001), the outcomes of training programmes vary considerably with programme design. In general, <lb/>training that is targeted and has a strong on-the-job element appears to be the most likely to be successful. <lb/>Furthermore, it is vital that the Active Ageing Strategy, which envisages specific measures to encourage the <lb/>participation of older persons in lifelong learning activities, be swiftly set up and implemented. <lb/>30. <lb/>The immediate impact on employment rates of any initiatives to encourage participation in <lb/>training activities might be limited though. In the 2006 Labour Force Survey only 5% of employed persons <lb/>stated that they would work longer if they could update their skills (Figure 8, panel B), indicating that the <lb/>lack of lifelong learning possibilities is not the main reason for withdrawing from the workforce. <lb/>Nonetheless such initiatives are an important complement to the further increase in the pensionable age and <lb/>the reduction of early retirement incentives. Both are likely to raise the interest of workers in lifelong <lb/>learning programmes to acquire the skills needed to find employment. <lb/>Raising the employment rates of youth <lb/>31. <lb/>The employment situation of youth has improved markedly in recent years with labour force <lb/>participation of those aged 15 to 29 rising from 52% in 2003 to 61% in mid-2008 and unemployment <lb/>falling from 12.3% to 7.4%. Although the progress clearly reflects the favourable economic conditions <lb/>over that period, the introduction of more flexible forms of employment as well as active labour market <lb/>policies aimed at facilitating the school-to-work transition also contributed to this development. These <lb/>active labour market policies include, for example, employment incentives for the young provided in the <lb/>form of subsidies and tax reliefs for employers, and training and education programmes such as the <lb/>Programme 10000 – Formal Education and Project Learning for Young Adults (see Box 3). <lb/>Box 3. Project Learning for Young Adults <lb/>Project Learning for Young Adults (PLYA) is a non-formal education programme for unemployed young adults <lb/>aged 15 to 25 who have failed at school, have no basic vocational education and face social exclusion. The basic <lb/>aim of the programme is to motivate participants to continue their formal education and acquire the knowledge and <lb/>skills needed on the job-market. Participants are meant to gain positive learning experiences and to more clearly <lb/>define their aspirations concerning their career and their general life. The programme has a high success rate <lb/>with 60% to 70% of the participants enrolling in a suitable educational program and/or finding employment. In 2007, <lb/>the programme won the European Regional Champions Award in the area of social policy. <lb/>Participants can join PLYA any time during the school year. Participation is strictly voluntary and participants <lb/>are entitled to stay in the programme for one year. The education focuses on three main areas. First, participants <lb/>gain basic knowledge in a variety of fields such as mathematics, writing, communication, and natural sciences and <lb/>they acquire the skills required for independent learning. Second, participants are prepared for the working life by <lb/>designing a career plan, establishing links with potential employers and learning the basic components of labour <lb/>legislation. Third, participants acquire socio-cultural skills such as taking responsibility for one&apos;s actions, dealing with <lb/>less favourable incentives from the social environment, and using leisure time more effectively and constructively. <lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>Project learning is carried out in four types of project work. Individual learning projects are part of the career <lb/>and individual learning plan of the student. They are derived from his/her defined personal goals such as the passing <lb/>of certain exams. In optional group project work each member of the group realises his/her own learning objectives <lb/>within the context of the common group project (e.g. a theatre play). The student is expected to work on the common <lb/>goals of the group and the group supports the efforts of the individual student. Productive project work is concerned <lb/>with the development of possibilities for the revival of old and disappearing crafts and the use of environment-<lb/>friendly technologies. Extra-curricular activities are used as a tool for raising a student&apos;s motivation and for enlarging <lb/>interests within new fields in which he/she has no experience. The activities can be directly connected with a certain <lb/>project or can be organised independently, just for fun or to satisfy the participant&apos;s own interest. <lb/>While participating in the programme students are guided by mentors. The mentor&apos;s sensibility for the interests <lb/>and abilities of the participant is thus an important element of the programme&apos;s success. Participants actively <lb/>participate in the implementation of the programme by choosing the theme of the project, the methods and <lb/>procedures, which helps to increase their motivation. Every student sets up an individual learning plan that has to be <lb/>realised during the programme. This plan is the foundation for the selection of activities in the programme and is <lb/>also used to evaluate the student&apos;s progress according to the goals set at the beginning. <lb/>32. <lb/>The recent progress notwithstanding, several problems remain that need to be addressed. First, <lb/>youth labour force participation is still below the OECD average (Figure 10, panel A), reflecting a <lb/>relatively long duration of initial education. Consistent with this, much of the increase in participation seen <lb/>in the age group 20 to 29 is due to a rising number of student workers who are not in regular employment. <lb/>Second, unemployment is still more prevalent among youth than among other age groups. Particularly <lb/>youth without upper secondary education face considerable difficulties in finding employment (Figure 10, <lb/>panel B). One possible reason is the high minimum wage which might hurt the young disproportionately as <lb/>they tend to be less productive than other workers due to the lack of experience. <lb/>Figure 10. The labour market situation of young adults <lb/>Per cent <lb/>1. <lb/>The reliability of results of the detailed data by age may be affected by the small sample size or the sampling method used. <lb/>2. <lb/>Includes post secondary non-tertiary education. <lb/>Source: OECD (2008), OECD Employment database – online version, www.oecd.org/els/employment/data and Eurostat database <lb/>(2009), Labour Force Survey, May. <lb/>Achieving the right balance between work and studies <lb/>33. <lb/>The demand for tertiary education has expanded rapidly in the last decade with a rising number <lb/>of school leavers wishing to continue education before entering the labour market. In 2006, one-third of <lb/>20-29 year-olds was enrolled in education compared with one-fourth in the average OECD country <lb/>(OECD, 2008). As longer periods in full time education should filter through to workforce skills and <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>growth potential, the increase in the number of tertiary students is a positive feature provided the right <lb/>skills are acquired at the right pace. However, the average duration of tertiary studies is rather long in <lb/>Slovenia. In the academic year 2006-07, students in higher professional programmes finished their studies <lb/>on average in 5.4 years and students in university programmes needed 6.9 years. <lb/>34. <lb/>One reason for the relatively long duration of tertiary studies is that the higher education sector <lb/>and particularly the universities have traditionally focused on providing long and strongly academic <lb/>courses. Since the launch of the higher education reform in 2004, the situation is changing as the system is <lb/>transformed into a three-cycle system consistent with the Bologna Declaration (Figure 11). Slovenia opted <lb/>for a gradual implementation of the Bologna reform by the academic year 2009-10 when only post-reform <lb/>programmes will be offered. Until then higher education institutions offer both pre and post-reform <lb/>programmes. As only a very small number of students have so far graduated from the new system, the <lb/>impact of the reform on the length of studies cannot yet be determined. <lb/>35. <lb/>A second major reason for the long study times is the Slovenian system of study support which <lb/>does not provide enough incentives for rapid graduation (Box 4). The level of benefits granted to students <lb/>enrolled in higher education – such as subsidies for accommodation, transport and meals – appears <lb/>relatively generous. Moreover, about a third of all students receive direct financial support in the form of <lb/>scholarships. As a share of total public expenditure on education, Slovenia spends much more on financial <lb/>aid to students than the average OECD country (Figure 12). Student loans do not currently exist in <lb/>Slovenia (with the exception of loans for studies abroad) as the loans introduced in 1999 were abolished <lb/>again in 2002/03 (Box 4). Higher education is in principle free for full-time students of first and second-<lb/>cycle programmes, though a ministerial decree requires part-time students to pay tuition fees. Institutions <lb/>have the autonomy to determine the level of tuition fees for part-time programmes themselves; in the <lb/>academic year 2008/09 the fees ranged from around EUR 1 800 to EUR 4 000 per annum. <lb/>Figure 11.

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>Box 4. Study support <lb/>Students enrolled in higher education benefit from subsidised accommodation, subsidised meals (coupon <lb/>system), discounts on public transportation, discounts on cultural events (such as theatre tickets) and on subscriptions <lb/>to sports clubs. The only direct financial support is provided in the form of scholarships. First, state scholarships <lb/>targeted at students from low income families are provided to full-time students who enrol in higher education before <lb/>the age of 27 and whose gross income per family member in the previous year did not exceed 130% of the guaranteed <lb/>wage. Second, academically talented students may be eligible for merit-based scholarships, so-called Zois <lb/>scholarships (named after a well-known Slovenian scholar). In addition to publicly provided scholarships, there are also <lb/>company scholarships offered by public and private organisations in relation to their (future) staff requirements. In <lb/>2007, 18% of all full-time students were granted a state scholarship (of around EUR 180 per month, on average), 11% <lb/>were granted a Zois scholarship (of around EUR 210 per month, on average) and 6% received a company scholarship <lb/>(of around EUR 240 per month, on average). <lb/>In 1999 a student loan system was first introduced. Loans were offered on the basis of a contract between the <lb/>student, the Employment Service of Slovenia and a bank holding a concession (an interest subsidy) awarded by the <lb/>Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs. Slovenian nationals who were under the age of 27 at the first enrolment, <lb/>who were not employed and who did not receive any type of scholarship were eligible for the loan. As the number of <lb/>applicants was very low, the scheme was abolished in 2002/03. The basic amount of a student loan was about <lb/>EUR 1 050 per annum in 2001, but it could be increased to a maximum amount of EUR 1 580 per annum in special <lb/>cases. <lb/>Figure 12. Public subsidies for tertiary education <lb/>1 <lb/>In per cent of total public expenditure on education, 2005 <lb/>1. <lb/>Public subsidies for education to households and other private entities. <lb/>Source: OECD (2008), Education at a Glance. <lb/>36. <lb/>Improving the quality of higher education institutions would also contribute to shortening the <lb/>duration of studies (IMAD, 2008b). The ratio of students to teaching staff, a frequently used indicator for <lb/>the quality of tertiary education, has barely improved in past years and still falls short of the comparable <lb/>ratios of most OECD countries (Figure 13, panel A), the main reason being the relatively low annual <lb/>expenditure per student (Čelebič, 2008). In 2005, Slovenia spent USD 8 500 per full-time student (in <lb/>purchasing power parities) compared with an OECD average of USD 11 500 (Figure 13, panel B). <lb/>Improving the quality of the teaching process may reduce the number of students who have to repeat <lb/>courses and prevent them from unduly prolonging their studies. <lb/></body>

Similarly, tuition fees in tertiary education that at least partially reflect the cost <lb/>of education should be introduced. This would raise the incentives for students to progress rapidly with <lb/>their studies and also improve market signals between students, providers and the labour market. In <lb/>addition, it would improve the funding of higher education institutions, thus contributing to a higher <lb/>quality of the teaching process. To avoid deterring students, especially those from low-income families, the <lb/>tuition fee system could be accompanied by publicly guaranteed student loans with repayments conditional <lb/>on earnings after graduation. <lb/>Preventing damage from the minimum wage <lb/>38. <lb/>The employment opportunities of youth, particularly the less skilled, might also be adversely <lb/>affected by the relatively high minimum wage. Theoretically, a statutory minimum wage set at too high a <lb/>level could become a barrier to employment for low-productivity workers by driving a wedge between <lb/>productivity and labour costs. However, it has proven difficult to pin down the negative employment <lb/>effects empirically (OECD, 2006b). Regarding the impact on the employment opportunities of young <lb/>workers the empirical evidence is mixed with some studies having identified negative effects of minimum <lb/>wages on youth employment, especially if combined with high non-wage labour costs (e.g. Abowd et al., <lb/>1997; Bassanini and Duval, 2006), while others have failed to do so (e.g. Stewart, 2002). <lb/>39. <lb/>Slovenia has had a statutory minimum wage (which covers all sectors of the economy) since <lb/>1995, when the tripartite social agreement determined a cash figure for the lowest permissible monthly <lb/>wage. Whilst the tripartite agreement concluded in 1997 raised the minimum wage by roughly the same <lb/>amount as pay in general, the agreement for the period 1999-2001 stipulated an extra increase with the aim <lb/>of gradually bringing the minimum wage up to 58% of the average wage in the manufacturing sector. 15 <lb/>During 1999-2004, the minimum wage was also adjusted in line with forecast consumer price inflation and <lb/>15. <lb/>The law implementing the provisions of the social agreement for 1999-2001 introduced, for the first time, a <lb/>national minimum wage in the proper sense as the validity of the part of the law that regulates the <lb/>minimum wage was not limited, as previously, by the duration of the social agreement. <lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>by the real GDP growth rate of the previous year. As a result it increased to around 46.5% of the average <lb/>wage in the private sector (54% of the average wage in the manufacturing sector) by 2004 (Figure 14, <lb/>panel A). Since 2006, the increase in the minimum wage has been decided by the government after <lb/>consulting the social partners, based on forecast consumer price inflation. Since inflation came out higher <lb/>than forecast in 2008 the legislation was amended to provide for an additional increase in the minimum <lb/>wage of about 5¼ per cent in March 2008. When setting annual increases in the minimum wage, mistakes <lb/>in forecasting inflation should not only be corrected when underestimated but also when overestimated. <lb/>40. <lb/>Although the minimum wage has declined relative to the average wage in recent years, it is still <lb/>fairly high by OECD standards (Figure 14, panel B) and may present a barrier to employment for young <lb/>people, especially for the less-skilled. The ratio of the minimum wage to the average wage should not <lb/>increase and preferably be further reduced in order to improve the employment prospects of the low-skilled <lb/>young workers. The argument for reducing the relative level of the minimum wage is reinforced by target <lb/>efficiency considerations (OECD, 2006b). Although the minimum wage is meant to improve the income of <lb/>low-income families, a substantial proportion of workers in minimum-wage jobs are likely not to be poor, <lb/>for example because other family members have earnings. And for those who risk sliding into poverty due <lb/>to a relative decline in the level of minimum wages, other instruments such as in-work benefits are <lb/>available that can be better targeted on low-income families. Several OECD countries have lower <lb/>minimum wages for youth, for example Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (see OECD, <lb/>2009, Table 3 for details). 16 However, the empirical evidence on the employment effects of such sub-<lb/>minima is mixed. While some studies indicate that the negative employment effects of minimum wages are <lb/>smaller when sub-minimum wages exist (e.g. Neumark and Wascher, 1999; Hyslop and Stillman, 2007), <lb/>others fail to detect any robust effect (e.g. Böckerman and Uusitalo, 2007). <lb/>Figure 14.

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>Coping with rising labour market dualism <lb/>41. <lb/>Slovenia has made some notable progress in the past decade in easing EPL in order to improve <lb/>the flexibility of its labour market (Box 1). Vodopivec et al. (2007) estimate an index of employment <lb/>protection legislation for Slovenia over the period 1991 to 2004 and conclude that both the amendment to <lb/>the Employment and Insurance against Unemployment Act that came into force in 1998 and the new <lb/>Employment Relationships Act that came into force in 2003 had a sizable impact on EPL over that period <lb/>(Table 1). Whilst the 1998 amendment to the EIUA facilitated temporary employment, the 2003 <lb/>amendment to the Employment Relationships Act focused primarily on the liberalisation of regular <lb/>employment and put some additional restrictions on temporary contracts. More recent amendments to the <lb/>two Acts, enacted respectively in 2006 and 2007, brought about further reductions in EPL on both types of <lb/>contracts. <lb/>Table 1.

Vodopivec (eds.), Mobilnost dela in <lb/>fleksibilnost sistema plač, Fakultete za Management, Koper. <lb/>42. <lb/>Despite these legislative changes, employment protection is still relatively high in Slovenia <lb/>(Figure 15). The most serious problem is that EPL tends to be much stricter for regular than for temporary <lb/>work as past reforms eased the use of temporary forms of employment while not going far enough in terms <lb/>of increased flexibility for those under permanent contracts. The administrative procedures for individual <lb/>notice and dismissal are cumbersome and the conditions under which dismissals are legitimate are stricter <lb/>than in many other OECD countries. Moreover, severance payments are still relatively high (Box 1). The <lb/>policy of liberalising temporary employment without a similar adjustment of permanent employment risks <lb/>creating a dual labour market where some jobs are more protected than others. 17 In particular groups with <lb/>weak attachment to the labour market tend to suffer from a partial relaxation of EPL. <lb/>43. <lb/>The share of workers with fixed-term contracts has indeed increased significantly since the <lb/>liberalisation of temporary employment, from 11% in the late 1990s to over 18% in 2007 (Figure 16, <lb/>panel A). A large share of this temporary employment is involuntary with more than half of all workers <lb/>employed on a temporary basis citing the inability to find a permanent job as the main reason for having a <lb/>temporary one in the 2007 Labour Force Survey. Temporary employment is particularly prevalent among <lb/>young workers; in 2007, more than two-thirds of those aged 15 to 24 had a fixed-term contract which is the <lb/>highest share among European Union countries (Figure 16, panel B). In fact, between 2003 and 2007 the <lb/>17. <lb/>Temporary contracts tend to be more common in countries with strict EPL on regular contracts even <lb/>though these countries often also have relatively strict rules on temporary contracts. <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>number of temporary jobs increased by more than the total number of jobs for the young, implying that the <lb/>number of regular jobs actually declined during the economic upswing. A large proportion of the <lb/>temporary employment by youth might be accounted for by student work (see above). The duration of <lb/>fixed-term contracts is generally very short; more than 80% of all temporary workers aged 15 to 24 have a <lb/>contract for less than one year (compared with 44% in the EU15). <lb/>Figure 15.

The OECD aggregate is an unweighted average. <lb/>Source: OECD (2006), Going for Growth, Economic Policy Reforms. <lb/>44. <lb/>The large share of youth on fixed-term contracts observed in Slovenia is consistent with existing <lb/>cross-country evidence showing that a larger difference in employment protection between regular and <lb/>temporary contracts goes along with a higher prevalence of temporary work among youth (OECD, 2004). <lb/>As the young are more likely to be subject to entry problems into the labour market than other groups of <lb/>the workforce they are more likely to be disproportionately affected by the effects of EPL on firms&apos; hiring <lb/>decisions. Although a temporary job might be the first step towards a more permanent and stable job, this <lb/>is not always the case and workers might get trapped in the situation of moving between temporary work <lb/>and unemployment. <lb/>45. <lb/>The benefits of enhancing overall firm flexibility notwithstanding, temporary work may <lb/>adversely affect career progression and productivity if workers get trapped in temporary forms of <lb/>employment that are typically characterised by weak job attachments and limited opportunities to upgrade <lb/>human capital (OECD, 2004). The problem of labour market dualism needs to be addressed swiftly, not <lb/>only for reasons of social equality, but also because of economic efficiency. Clawing back past <lb/>achievements in relaxing EPL for temporary work contracts would, however, be the wrong choice. Instead, <lb/>once the current economic crisis dissipates, the authorities should continue to ease EPL for regular job <lb/>contracts. In particular, the administrative burden on individual notice and dismissal should be reduced and <lb/>the conditions under which individual dismissals are legitimate should be relaxed. Moreover, severance <lb/>pay provisions should be reformed. One option would be to follow the Austrian example and transform the <lb/>traditional severance pay system into individual severance accounts (Box 5). <lb/></body>

The Austrian severance pay reform* <lb/>Until 2002 severance pay had to be paid to private-sector employees upon termination of the employment <lb/>contract (by the employer or in mutual agreement) provided the employee had worked for the employer for at least <lb/>three years. The payment amounted to two monthly wages after three years of company membership and increased <lb/>with the duration of the job up to a maximum value of one yearly income after 25 years. This system was criticised for <lb/>excluding workers on short-term contracts (e.g. seasonal workers) from the right to severance pay and for inhibiting <lb/>labour mobility as employees lost their entitlement to severance pay in the case of self-termination. Furthermore, it was <lb/>pointed out that SMEs might have liquidity problems if they were to make several severance payments simultaneously. <lb/>In 2003, the traditional severance pay system was replaced by a system of individual saving accounts. The <lb/>account of each worker is funded by the employer via an untaxed payment of 1.5377% of the gross wage and is <lb/>managed by an employee provision fund that invests the balance on capital markets. The payments start in the second <lb/>month of the employment relationship. If the employee is dismissed after three years of job tenure, he can choose <lb/>between a cash payment, further investment in the same employee provision fund or in the employee provision fund of <lb/>the new employer, and transferring the respective amount as a one-time payment to a pension insurance fund. The <lb/>entitlements to severance pay can thus be cumulated by an employee over his or her entire working career, serving as <lb/>a form of retirement saving. Upon retirement the employee can either claim a cash payment or convert entitlements <lb/>into an annuity. If the employee leaves the company voluntarily or if he is dismissed during the first three years of the <lb/>job contract no cash payment can be claimed, though the claim is not lost as it can be transferred to the new job. <lb/>The reform extended the entitlement to severance pay considerably as entitlement starts after one month and <lb/>neither depends on the job tenure nor on the way the employment relationship is terminated. The level of the payment <lb/>now depends on the performance of the employee provision fund on the capital market, though the nominal <lb/>contribution paid by the employer is guaranteed. From an employer&apos;s perspective, the new scheme avoids the <lb/>one-time costs of dismissal and the uncertainty related to the size of the payment at the time of hiring. However, the <lb/>contributions to the individual accounts add to labour costs. <lb/>__________________ <lb/>* This box draws on Hofer, H.

			<body>ECO/WKP(2009)60 <lb/>46. <lb/>Facilitating access of temporary workers to appropriate training could also help to improve their <lb/>chances of finding a permanent job. Research has shown that job training is strongly correlated with <lb/>opportunities for temporary workers to move into permanent jobs (Grubb et al., 2007). In this regard, the <lb/>recommendations regarding lifelong learning might help to mitigate the dual labour market issue. Finally, <lb/>the problem of student work needs to be addressed. The preferential treatment of student work may induce <lb/>firms to hire students instead of regular workers and thus intensify labour market duality. The <lb/>reimbursement of social security contributions to employers who hire unemployed persons younger <lb/>than 26, first-time job-seekers whose occupation is in excess supply, or people under 28 who have been <lb/>unemployed for 24 months (introduced in 2006) is likely to mitigate the negative effects somewhat. <lb/>However, subsidising regular work by young graduates in order to prevent it from being crowded out by <lb/>subsidised student work is very costly. Instead, the authorities should consider phasing out the preferential <lb/>treatment of student work as recommended above. <lb/>Box 6. Main recommendations to improve the functioning of the labour market <lb/>Mitigating the effect of the economic crisis without jeopardising the long-run functioning of the labour market <lb/>•  Ensure that the subsidy scheme for shorter working hours is phased out once the crisis dissipates. In the<lb/>meantime, make eligibility temporary in nature. <lb/>•  Avoid any measures that are detrimental to the long-term functioning of the labour market, such as<lb/>tightening the rules for immigrant workers. <lb/>Boosting the labour force participation of the elderly <lb/>•  The increase in pensionable ages for women foreseen in the 1999 Pension and Disability Insurance Act<lb/>should be accelerated. <lb/>•  The pensionable age should be further increased for both genders, possibly taking into account advice from<lb/>an expert commission when deciding about the size of the necessary increase. Once the increase has been <lb/>phased in, and life expectancy at the full pensionable age has reached a suitable level, additional increases <lb/>in the pensionable age should be linked to gains in life expectancy and the length of the pension qualifying <lb/>period should be raised accordingly.

Abolish the upper limit on<lb/>the number of additional working years beyond the statutory retirement age during which bonuses are paid <lb/>(currently set at three years). <lb/>•  Phase out remaining possibilities to retire prior to the pensionable age. Limit the use of informal pathways to<lb/>early retirement by reviewing the disability and long-term sickness insurance schemes to ensure that <lb/>eligibility conditions are sufficiently tight and adequately monitored, and by reducing the unemployment <lb/>benefit duration for long-term unemployed older workers towards the general length of 12 months once the <lb/>current economic crisis dissipates. <lb/>•  Further strengthen the link between pension benefits and working careers by basing benefits on full lifetime<lb/>average earnings. <lb/>•  Allow people to receive wage and pension income at the same time. At the very least, relax the rules for<lb/>partial retirement and phase out the tax disincentives. <lb/>•  Ensure that the inter-ministerial working group which was set up to discuss the implementation of the<lb/>Lifelong Learning Strategy quickly develops a plan to put the strategy into action. Evaluate the impact of <lb/>adult education programmes on labour market outcomes. Swiftly set up and implement the Active Ageing <lb/>Strategy. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">ANNEX A1. <lb/>ESTIMATING A TIME-VARYING NAIRU BY MEANS OF THE KALMAN FILTER <lb/>1. <lb/>The estimation of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) follows the <lb/>approach outlined in Gianella et al. (2008). Using the Kalman filter, the NAIRU is derived from its ability <lb/>to explain inflationary developments within a Phillips-curve framework, subject to constraints on its <lb/>evolution over time. The Phillips curve equation relates the change in consumer price inflation (measured <lb/>by the change in the harmonised consumer price index) to real import price inflation (weighted by the <lb/>import content of consumption to account for the economy&apos;s rising openness) and the unemployment gap, <lb/>defined as the difference between the NAIRU and the unemployment rate. 1 Assuming dynamic <lb/>homogeneity to hold, the relationship takes the following form: <lb/>v <lb/>D <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>MGS <lb/>L <lb/>t <lb/>VAT <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>MGS <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>n <lb/>j <lb/>SH <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>m <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>Δ <lb/>= <lb/>Δ <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>∑ <lb/>∑ <lb/>δ <lb/>γ <lb/>π <lb/>π <lb/>β <lb/>π <lb/>α <lb/>π <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>* <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>where π is domestic inflation, MGS SH is the import content of consumption, 2 π MGS is import price inflation <lb/>(goods and services), U is the unemployment rate, U * is the NAIRU, D VAT is a dummy variable meant to <lb/>capture the introduction of value added tax (VAT) in July 1999, and v t is the residual. The appropriate <lb/>lag structure for the three right-hand-side inflation variables is determined by starting with four lags each <lb/>and then dropping statistically insignificant lags. Data on domestic inflation and unemployment are <lb/>obtained from respectively Eurostat and the Statistical Office of Slovenia; all other data are taken from the <lb/>OECD Economic Outlook database. <lb/>2. <lb/>There is no unique way of using the Kalman filter to estimate the NAIRU and a variety of <lb/>assumptions may be adopted to describe the stochastic process it follows. Following Gianella et al. (2008), <lb/>the NAIRU is inferred from two transition equations specifying the time-series properties of respectively <lb/>the NAIRU and the unemployment gap. The NAIRU is modelled as a simple random walk process which <lb/>seems appropriate given that the unemployment rate series is integrated of order one. The transition <lb/>equation for the NAIRU thus takes the following form: <lb/>ε t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>+ <lb/>= − <lb/>* <lb/>1 <lb/>* <lb/>where the error term ε t is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 񮽙 2 and <lb/>uncorrelated with the error term of the Phillips-curve equation v t . <lb/>3. <lb/>In addition, a law of motion is imposed on the gap between the NAIRU and the unemployment <lb/>rate to ensure that the unemployment rate converges to the NAIRU in the absence of shocks. This <lb/>assumption is consistent with the work by Friedman (1968) on the natural rate hypothesis implying that the <lb/>unemployment rate cannot deviate permanently from its natural rate. The unemployment gap is assumed to <lb/>follow a second-order autoregressive process. This additional restriction allows inferring the level of the <lb/>1. <lb/>The change in the real oil price was initially also included in the equation but did not turn out significant. <lb/>2. <lb/>Calculated as MGS t <lb/>SH = M t /(Y t + M t – X t ) where M, X and Y denote imports, exports and domestic output. <lb/></div>

			<body>NAIRU not only on the basis of information on inflationary pressures, but also based on the unemployment <lb/>rate dynamics themselves. The transition equation for the unemployment gap can be written as: <lb/>ζ <lb/>ψ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>L <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>) <lb/>)( <lb/>( <lb/>* <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>* <lb/>where the error term ζ t is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ ζ <lb/>2 <lb/>and uncorrelated with ε t . <lb/>Although not necessary for the solution of the model, constraints are imposed on the sum of the <lb/>autoregressive parameters to ensure sensible time-series properties of the unemployment gap. 3 <lb/>4. <lb/>Applying the Kalman filter to the model outlined above requires assumptions about several <lb/>parameters. First, the values and variances of the two state variables (the NAIRU and the unemployment <lb/>gap) in the initial period have to be pre-specified. The initial value of the NAIRU is set equal to the <lb/>average unemployment rate around the first year of the sample and the initial value of the unemployment <lb/>gap is set equal to the difference between the unemployment rate in the initial period and the prior for the <lb/>NAIRU. Second, assumptions are made about the relative variances of the three residuals σ v <lb/>2 , σ 񮽙 <lb/>2 and σ ζ <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>The variance of the error term in the transition equation of the NAIRU relative to the one of the error term <lb/>in the Phillips-curve equation (the signal-to-noise-ratio) determines the smoothness of the NAIRU series <lb/>with a smaller ratio resulting in a less volatile NAIRU. While in principle the Kalman filter allows <lb/>estimating the three variances together with the other parameters of the model, this often leads to NAIRU <lb/>series that are too smooth (Richardson et al., 2000). As a consequence, the variances are typically fixed in <lb/>empirical applications. Following the suggestion by Gordon (1997), the signal-to-noise ratio is chosen such <lb/>that it allows the NAIRU to move around freely but rules out sharp quarter-to-quarter gyrations. <lb/>5. <lb/>The model is estimated over the period 1997Q2 to 2008Q3, the longest period for which all data <lb/>are available. The unemployment gap is found to have a significant influence on consumer price inflation <lb/>suggesting that the derived NAIRU can be interpreted as the unemployment rate consistent with stable <lb/>inflation (Table A1.1). The sacrifice ratio implied by the estimated coefficients is equal to 0.59 which is <lb/>consistent with the values obtained by Gianella et al. (2008) for other OECD countries. The estimates <lb/>suggest that the NAIRU declined throughout the sample period, reaching around 5½ per cent in the third <lb/>quarter of 2008 (Figure 2). The sharp drop in unemployment in recent years appears to have been to a large <lb/>extent a cyclical phenomenon as the unemployment rate fell considerably below the NAIRU. <lb/>Table A1.1.
