These include contributing to <lb/>the global mitigation effort and adaptation needed to prevent dangerous climate change, while providing <lb/>enough food for a population of 9 billion by 2050 as well as shelter and livelihoods for rural populations <lb/>and various ecosystem services. The existing mitigation reporting and accounting arrangements for the <lb/>land sector are complex, not applicable to all Parties, and provide limited scope for pursuing more cost-<lb/>effective accounting approaches that would enable developing countries to address conflicting policy <lb/>objectives such as addressing climate change while increasing agricultural output. This paper has two aims. <lb/>The first is to lay out possible elements of a long-term vision for the post-2020 reporting and accounting <lb/>framework for emissions and removals from the land sector, building on existing experience with reporting <lb/>and accounting as well as previous studies. The second is to identify possible steps that could be taken at <lb/>COP 20 in 2014, COP 21 in 2015, and in 2016-2020 to put Parties on a pathway towards realising this <lb/>vision. <lb/>JEL classification: F53, O44, Q23, Q24, Q54, Q56 <lb/>Keywords: UNFCCC, climate change, mitigation accounting, land use, land use change, forestry <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Jeter les bases d&apos;un cadre de déclaration et de comptabilisation post-2020 dans le secteur foncier <lb/>La gestion des terres est confrontée à une série de défis redoutables au XXIe siècle.

Les dispositifs existants de déclaration et de comptabilisation des <lb/>mesures d&apos;atténuation dans le secteur foncier sont complexes, ne sont pas applicables à toutes les Parties et <lb/>n&apos;offrent guère de possibilités de mettre en oeuvre des méthodes comptables plus efficaces et économes, <lb/>qui permettraient aux pays en développement de concilier des objectifs contradictoires consistant, par <lb/>exemple, à faire face au changement climatique tout en augmentant leur production agricole.

			<body>Executive summary <lb/>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently <lb/>preparing intended nationally determined contributions for the post-2020 period, as part of the new climate <lb/>change agreement to be adopted at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 21) in <lb/>Paris in 2015. The reporting and accounting 1 framework for these post-2020 nationally determined <lb/>contributions has yet to be agreed. An important part of this reporting and accounting framework will be <lb/>how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and other land use <lb/>(AFOLU, hereafter referred to as the &quot; land sector &quot; ) are treated. <lb/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that anthropogenic GHG emissions <lb/>from the land sector are currently around 10-12 GtCO 2 -eq per year – the second largest source of <lb/>anthropogenic GHG emissions after the energy sector. Further, non-CO 2 emissions from agricultural <lb/>activities such as enteric fermentation in livestock, manure management, rice cultivation and agricultural <lb/>soils now exceed CO 2 emissions from deforestation and other land use changes. Mitigation and adaptation <lb/>in the land sector are therefore essential if the goal to limit the rise in global average temperature to below <lb/>2 °C above pre-industrial levels is to stay within reach, and the worst impacts avoided. <lb/>Several sets of arrangements currently exist for reporting and accounting of anthropogenic GHG emissions <lb/>and removals from the land sector. These include reporting via GHG inventories under the Convention, <lb/>reporting and accounting for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities by Annex B <lb/>Parties 2 under the Kyoto Protocol (KP), and recognition of reduced emissions from deforestation, forest <lb/>degradation and related activities (REDD+) in developing countries. Under the KP, special accounting <lb/>rules have been established for LULUCF activities while non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture are treated <lb/>the same way as other inventory categories for national accounting purposes. Project-level reporting and <lb/>accounting methodologies have also been developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) <lb/>and by the voluntary carbon markets. <lb/>The LULUCF part of the land sector has some special features that distinguish it from other sectors such as <lb/>agriculture, energy, transport, industry and waste. It is particularly difficult to separate anthropogenic from <lb/>natural emissions and removals for LULUCF. The effects of past management decisions can have a <lb/>particularly strong influence on emissions and removals from forests, since they determine the age-class <lb/>structure and harvesting cycles of forests – this is known as the &quot; legacy effect &quot; . Removals of CO 2 by <lb/>vegetation and soils are not necessarily permanent, and reversals can be triggered by natural disturbances <lb/>or human activities. Further, uncertainties tend to be high and some of the emissions are the result of <lb/>essential activities such as food production. Consequently, the existing reporting and accounting <lb/>arrangements are complex, not applicable to all Parties, and provide limited flexibility for pursuing more <lb/>cost-effective accounting approaches that would enable developing countries to address potentially <lb/>conflicting policy objectives such as addressing climate change while increasing agricultural output. <lb/>Possible elements of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and accounting are presented in this <lb/>paper. The vision is of a multi-dimensional land sector reporting and accounting framework that is <lb/>applicable to all countries and increases in comprehensiveness over time. The long-term vision builds on <lb/>the conclusions of other recent studies in this area and respects the special features of the LUCUF part of <lb/>the land sector outlined above. The overarching objective of the reporting and accounting framework is to <lb/>1 <lb/>In this paper, reporting refers to the measurement and reporting of information on GHG emissions and <lb/>removals, and is largely technical in nature. Accounting refers to what counts towards the achievement of <lb/>mitigation commitments and how implementation of commitments is tracked, and is more political in <lb/>nature. <lb/></body>

			<body>7 <lb/>build trust between Parties by tracking progress in implementation of mitigation contributions in the land <lb/>sector. The possible elements identified are: <lb/>Generic elements (relevant to all sectors) <lb/>• Use of IPCC 2006 Guidelines by all Parties (with flexibility for least developed countries and <lb/>small island developing states) to measure and report information on key sources and sinks, with <lb/>different Parties using different tiers for different sources and sinks, according to capacity. <lb/> • Increasing quality and accuracy of reporting for land sector sources and sinks (i.e. using higher <lb/>IPCC tiers for key categories where possible). <lb/> • Provision of up-front information alongside intended nationally determined contributions that <lb/>promotes transparency, clarity and understanding. <lb/> • Flexibility in some aspects of the reporting and accounting framework and acceptance of <lb/>different entry points for different countries, to accommodate the different national circumstances <lb/>and capacities of countries. <lb/> • Focus on cost-effective reporting and accounting.<lb/>• Recognition of need for means of implementation to increase reporting and accounting capacity <lb/>in developing countries.<lb/>Land-specific elements (relevant to the land sector only) <lb/>• Increasing coverage over successive cycles of nationally determined contributions for accounting <lb/>for anthropogenic sources and sinks (with existing accounting of non-CO 2 emissions from <lb/>agriculture to continue for Annex B Parties). <lb/> • Provisions to address age-class structure effects in forests and the risk of natural disturbances and <lb/>reversals of sequestered carbon from forests and other land sinks. <lb/> • Use of a &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule for coverage of sources and sinks.<lb/>• Accommodate mitigation contributions expressed relative to reference levels or using intensity <lb/>metrics relating to agriculture, forestry and soils, with a view to providing cost-effective <lb/>accounting options that take into account national circumstances. <lb/> • Technical assessment of reference levels where appropriate to increase confidence in the baselines <lb/>against which progress is tracked. <lb/> • Reporting of qualitative information on a Parties&apos; vision for the land sector and the multiple <lb/>benefits of policies and environmental and social safeguards (where applicable), to complement <lb/>the quantitative accounting framework.<lb/>The long-term vision can be depicted as a multi-dimensional matrix, with various dimensions for reporting <lb/>and accounting. Two of the most important dimensions could be the coverage of accounting for key <lb/>sources and sinks and the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting (Figure ES.1). Parties could <lb/>agree shared direction of travel for all Parties over time, in terms of increasing the coverage of accounting <lb/>for key sources and sinks and increasing the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting. Countries in <lb/>a position to do so would be expected to advance over time towards higher IPCC tier approaches for <lb/>estimating emissions or removals from key categories. <lb/>Countries with low capacity for measuring and reporting could start by reporting GHG emissions from key <lb/>sources and sinks using the IPCC Tier 1 approach, which is the simplest approach and uses default <lb/></body>

			<body>emissions factors. Increasing use of country-specific emissions factors and remote sensing technologies <lb/>and other techniques could help to increase the accuracy of land sector data. Capacity building would be <lb/>needed to assist low-capacity countries to increase their reporting and accounting coverage over time. <lb/>Figure ES.1: A shared direction of travel for land sector accounting <lb/>This paper outlines possible short-term steps for COP 20, COP 21 and 2016-2020 that could put Parties on <lb/>a pathway towards realising the long-term vision. Some Parties may choose to include mitigation (and <lb/>potentially also adaptation) actions in the land sector as components of their intended nationally <lb/>determined contributions under the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action <lb/>(ADP). The nationally determined contributions that Parties choose to put forward could include economy-<lb/>wide contributions covering the land sector, sector-specific goals, goals relative to baselines or reference <lb/>levels, project-level actions, and individual policies and measures. At COP 20, Parties could agree to create <lb/>a formal work stream to discuss post-2020 land sector accounting issues, and decide the up-front <lb/>information to be provided alongside land sector contributions. <lb/>At COP 21 in 2015, a set of foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting could be <lb/>agreed that put Parties on a pathway towards the possible long-term vision outlined above. The foundations <lb/>for reporting could include agreement by all parties to use IPCC 2006 Guidelines for reporting GHG <lb/>inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals. The foundations for accounting could include: <lb/>agreement to expand the coverage of land sector accounting over time, with a view to achieving broad <lb/>coverage of key categories of anthropogenic sources and sinks in the land sector in all countries; that the <lb/> &quot; once in, always in &quot; accounting rule is to be applied in the post-2020 period; that both emissions and <lb/>removals are to be accounted for; and that there are to be technical assessments of reference levels (where <lb/>called for by the type of contribution or as part of technical corrections, e.g. for age-class effects in forests) <lb/>to increase confidence and build trust. <lb/>Elaboration of technical details relating to the land sector reporting and accounting framework could be <lb/>undertaken in the period 2016-2020. Issues remaining to be addressed after COP 21 could include: the <lb/>possible development of guidance for reference levels and intensity-based approaches for agriculture, as <lb/>ways to deal with legacy effects and address multiple policy objectives; treatment of removals due to <lb/>natural disturbances or indirect human effects; the approach to be used for identifying anthropogenic GHG <lb/>emissions and removals; and the potential role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms. <lb/>Quality and <lb/>accuracy of <lb/>data used for <lb/>accounting <lb/>Coverage of accounting for <lb/>key sources and sinks <lb/>Broad <lb/>Narrow <lb/>High IPCC tiers <lb/>Low IPCC tiers <lb/></body>

			<body>Millions of people in rural communities also depend on agriculture and forestry for their livelihoods. <lb/>Therefore in addition to the accounting system, which focuses on tracking progress towards quantitative <lb/>mitigation commitments, Parties could be encouraged to develop and report qualitative information on <lb/>holistic landscape management strategies and benefits of actions in areas such as environmental and social <lb/>safeguards (as currently applied under the REDD+ framework), climate-smart agriculture, and ecosystem-<lb/>based adaptation. Consistent with their type of nationally determined contribution, Parties could also <lb/>choose to deal with these competing demands by focussing on efficiency or productivity, such as GHG <lb/>emissions per unit of agricultural output. <lb/></body>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Land management faces significant challenges in the 21 st century. These include contributing to the global <lb/>mitigation effort needed to prevent dangerous climate change, while providing enough food for a <lb/>population of 9 billion by 2050 as well as shelter and livelihoods for rural populations and various <lb/>ecosystem services. Risk multipliers include increasing land degradation and perturbed cycles of nitrogen, <lb/>phosphorous and other nutrients, as well as growing water stress in many regions and other climate-related <lb/>impacts. <lb/>There is a constant, natural exchange of carbon between the land, the atmosphere and the oceans. For <lb/>hundreds of years human activities have interfered with this natural cycle resulting in a significant net <lb/>transfer of carbon from the land stock to the atmosphere and ocean. In addition to CO 2 emissions and <lb/>removals due to changes in land use, notably emissions from the clearing of forest land to make way for <lb/>agriculture or settlements, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions are produced by agricultural sources such as ruminant <lb/>livestock, manure, rice cultivation, agricultural soils and the burning of agricultural residues. <lb/>Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently negotiating a new <lb/>2015 climate change agreement under the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced <lb/>Action (ADP). Many developed and developing countries may choose to include mitigation (and possibly <lb/>also adaptation) actions in the land sector as nationally determined contributions under the 2015 <lb/>agreement. The negotiation of the 2015 agreement presents an opportunity to create &quot; an integrated <lb/>accounting and incentive framework for adaptation and mitigation strategies across all land uses &quot; (Parker <lb/>et al., 2014). Such a reporting and accounting framework could improve comparability between the <lb/>information provided by countries regarding emissions and removals from the land sector, while retaining <lb/>flexibility to take into account national circumstances. <lb/>This paper focuses on land sector reporting and accounting 3 in the context of the UNFCCC and has two <lb/>aims. The first aim is to lay out possible elements of a long-term vision for the post-2020 reporting and <lb/>accounting framework for emissions and removals from the land sector, building on existing experience <lb/>with reporting and accounting as well as previous studies. The second aim is to identify possible steps that <lb/>could be taken at COP 20 in 2014, COP 21 in 2015, and in 2016-2020 to put Parties on a pathway towards <lb/>realising this vision. <lb/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global anthropogenic GHG <lb/>emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) currently total around 10-12 GtCO 2 -eq <lb/>per year, making it the second largest source of anthropogenic GHG emissions after the energy sector <lb/>(IPCC, 2014a). Further, non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture are rising rapidly and since the mid-2000s <lb/>they have been a greater GHG contributor than CO 2 emissions from deforestation (Christ, 2014). In this <lb/>paper, the term &quot; land sector &quot; is used as shorthand to refer to the AFOLU sector. <lb/>There are currently several sets of arrangements for reporting and accounting for land sector emissions and <lb/>removals. The IPCC has developed GHG inventory methods that treat the land sector coherently and are <lb/>used for reporting to the UNFCCC. Under the Kyoto Protocol (KP), Annex B Parties 4 account for <lb/>agriculture and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities, although accounting remains <lb/>voluntary for some LULUCF activities. A work stream on reducing emissions from deforestation and <lb/>forest degradation and associated activities (REDD+) in developing countries has been established under <lb/>3 <lb/>The IPCC defines accounting as &quot; the rules for comparing emissions and removals as reported with <lb/>commitments &quot; (IPCC, 2000). <lb/></body>

			<body>the UNFCCC. However, developing countries have not so far had international emissions limitation or <lb/>reduction commitments under the UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocol and therefore anthropogenic emissions and <lb/>removals from agriculture, forestry and other land use in developing countries remain largely unaccounted <lb/>for. Further, accurate measurement of emissions and removals from the land sector can be difficult and <lb/>some of the emissions are the result of essential activities such as food production – a particularly sensitive <lb/>policy area in many developing countries. <lb/>Section 2 provides background information on recent relevant studies, existing arrangements for land <lb/>sector reporting and accounting and special features of the land sector. Section 3 outlines possible elements <lb/>of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and accounting that builds on existing approaches. Section 4 <lb/>lays out possible short-term steps that could be taken over the coming years in the UNFCCC negotiations <lb/>to lay the foundations for the long-term vision. Section 5 concludes. A discussion of the finance, <lb/>technology and capacity building tools needed to support land sector mitigation and adaptation in <lb/>developing countries is important but beyond the scope of this paper. <lb/>2. Background <lb/>2.1 Recent studies on post-2020 land sector accounting <lb/>Several studies examining post-2020 land sector accounting have recently been published. A selection of <lb/>these are summarised in Table 1. The possible elements of a long-term vision outlined in this paper build <lb/>upon common aspects of these studies where possible. <lb/>Table 1. Recent work on land sector accounting in the future climate agreement (not exhaustive) <lb/>Author/Year <lb/>Title <lb/>Main points <lb/>Canaveira <lb/>(2013) <lb/>Options and Elements <lb/>for an Accounting <lb/>Framework for the <lb/>Land Sector in the <lb/>Post-2020 Climate <lb/>Regime <lb/>This paper lays out various options for a future accounting framework with a strong <lb/>focus on lessons learned from existing experience and new emerging accounting <lb/>systems. The paper calls for a holistic approach to AFOLU accounting, with <lb/>fungibility between AFOLU and other sectors, full carbon accounting on all lands, <lb/>and a focus on creating incentives to promote good land management practices. <lb/>Estrada et al. <lb/>(2014) <lb/>Land Use in a Future <lb/>Climate Agreement <lb/>This paper presents the special features of the land sector, such as the legacy effect, <lb/>non-permanence, natural disturbances and measurement uncertainties, and discusses <lb/>how those features could be addressed in the 2015 agreement. It lays out different <lb/>options for the form of land sector contributions as well as options for incentives, <lb/>both monetary and non-monetary, to increase the ambition of land sector <lb/>contributions. <lb/>Hood, Briner <lb/>and Rocha <lb/>(2014) <lb/>GHG or not GHG: <lb/>Accounting for Diverse <lb/>Mitigation <lb/>Contributions in the <lb/>Post-2020 Climate <lb/>Framework <lb/>This paper contains a chapter describing possible options for a more comprehensive <lb/>land sector accounting system, including a KP activity-based approach, a UNFCCC <lb/>land-based approach, a &quot; reference levels for all &quot; approach, and &quot; agreement on <lb/>principles &quot; for land sector accounting. It also explores how the concept of bounded <lb/>flexibility could be applied to the land sector and identifies elements needed for the <lb/>construction of reference levels. <lb/>Iversen et al. <lb/>(2014) <lb/>Understanding Land <lb/>Use in the UNFCCC <lb/>This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing arrangements for the land <lb/>sector, including reporting and accounting under the Convention and the KP, <lb/>REDD+, CDM and Joint Implementation (JI) accounting, as well as treatment of <lb/>natural disturbances, harvested wood products, and social and environmental <lb/>safeguards. <lb/>Parker et al. <lb/>(2014) <lb/>The Land-Use Sector <lb/>within the Post-2020 <lb/>Climate Regime <lb/>This paper examines four options for post-2020 land sector contributions: national <lb/>economy-wide targets; national or sub-national sectoral baselines; project-level <lb/>sectoral baselines; and policies and measures. It calls for an integrated approach to <lb/>mitigation and adaptation strategies in the land sector, as well as the convergence of <lb/>LULUCF, REDD+ and agriculture accounting to create a set of harmonised, <lb/>coherent policies on land use. <lb/>12 <lb/>2.2 Existing arrangements for land sector reporting and accounting <lb/>There are currently several systems for land sector reporting and accounting. These include: reporting for <lb/>anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals under the Convention; reporting and accounting for LULUCF <lb/>activities for Annex B Parties under the Kyoto Protocol; measurement, reporting and verification for <lb/>afforestation, reforestation and agriculture projects in developing countries via the Clean Development <lb/>Mechanism (CDM) as well as voluntary carbon markets; recognition for REDD+ activities in developing <lb/>countries; and arrangements for emission reduction targets for developed countries and nationally <lb/>appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) for developing countries under the Cancun Agreements. <lb/>The unique features of the land sector, such as natural disturbances and the risk of crediting or debiting <lb/>non-anthropogenic outcomes, make it difficult to design a simple accounting system for this sector. For <lb/>example, most but not all LULUCF activities can be accounted for by Annex B Parties under the Kyoto <lb/>Protocol – some activities are mandatory, some are voluntary, some accounting rules depend on decisions <lb/>taken in the previous commitment period, and different types of baseline are used for different activities. <lb/>There are currently separate sets of arrangements for Annex B Parties and other Parties and there is no <lb/>international accounting framework that is applicable to all Parties. This makes it difficult to estimate the <lb/>aggregate impact of mitigation actions being undertaken in the land sector in different countries. Further, <lb/>the existing accounting arrangements provide selected coverage of emissions and removals from the land <lb/>sector (Table 2). The existing accounting arrangements therefore do not necessarily provide recognition for <lb/>the full range of mitigation opportunities available in the land sector. <lb/>The existing arrangements for reporting and accounting in the land sector are outlined below. Convergence <lb/>of the existing separate arrangements could eventually result in an accounting framework for the land <lb/>sector that is applicable to all Parties and provides recognition for a diverse range of actions to tackle <lb/>climate change in the land sector. <lb/></body>

These include <lb/>common reporting format (CRF) tables containing quantitative information on emissions and removals, as <lb/>well as national inventory reports (NIRs) containing qualitative information on emissions trends and data <lb/>collection methods and systems.

Non-Annex I <lb/>Parties are to report GHG inventories as part of biennial update reports and national communications, <lb/>which are to be provided every four years subject to availability of support. Non-Annex I Parties shall, to <lb/>the extent possible, estimate anthropogenic emissions and removals of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O in their GHG <lb/>inventories, and are encouraged to report information on emissions of HFCs, PF 6 and other GHGs as <lb/></body>

			<body>appropriate (UNFCCC, 2002). For non-Annex I countries pursuing REDD+ activities 5 there are additional <lb/>reporting requirements, including information on proposed forest reference emissions levels and how <lb/>safeguards are being addressed and respected. <lb/>GHG inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals from energy, transport, industry, waste and <lb/>AFOLU are reported by Parties in accordance with IPCC guidelines. The aim of the IPCC guidelines is to <lb/>ensure that GHG inventories are &quot; neither over nor under-estimates as far as can be judged &quot; (IPCC, 2000). <lb/>Further, uncertainties in the data are to be reduced as far as practicable. The use of these guidelines <lb/>enhances comparability and can help to provide robust and comparable data on emissions and removals <lb/>that can in turn provide a basis for accounting. The IPCC guidelines are developed over time with updated <lb/>guidelines and supplements. Table 4 summarises the IPCC guidance available to date specifically for the <lb/>land-related parts of GHG inventories. There are currently differences in the IPCC guidance recommended <lb/>for use by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Consistency between GHG inventories would be improved if <lb/>all Parties were use the IPCC 2006 Guidelines to prepare their inventories while using different IPCC tiers 6 <lb/>for keys categories according to national capacities. <lb/>The IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories divide all land into six land categories. These categories are <lb/>forest land, cropland, grassland, settlements, wetlands and other land. A distinction is also made between <lb/>managed and unmanaged land, where managed land is defined as &quot; land where human interventions and <lb/>practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions &quot; (IPCC, 2006). <lb/>Conversions of managed land from one category to another are tracked. To compile the GHG inventory, <lb/>emissions and removals resulting from each land-use category are estimated, as well as emissions and <lb/>removals resulting from land-use changes. This approach is known as the &quot; land-based &quot; approach. <lb/>5 <lb/>Many non-Annex I countries are undertaking REDD+ activities with non-UNFCCC programmes that <lb/>support those activities, such as the UN-REDD Programme, the REDD+ Partnership, the Forest Investment <lb/>Program (FIP) and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF). <lb/>6 <lb/>The IPCC tier approach represents a hierarchy of levels of methodological complexity (IPCC, 2006). <lb/>Higher tiers imply increased accuracy in the method or parameters used in the estimation of emissions and <lb/>removals. Tier 1 refers to the use of default data whereas Tier 2 implies the use of country-specific data. <lb/>Advanced methods and detailed country-specific data are applied within the Tier 3 approach. Higher tiers <lb/>are generally considered to be more accurate but can also imply higher uncertainties. If capacity is <lb/>available, higher tier methodologies shall be especially applied for key sources due to their implication for <lb/>the absolute emission level (IPCC, 2000). <lb/></body>

			<body>LULUCF accounting under the Kyoto Protocol <lb/>A set of principles for LULUCF accounting were agreed at CMP 1 in 2005. These were (UNFCCC, 2005): <lb/>a) That the treatment of these activities be based on sound science. <lb/>b) That consistent methodologies be used over time for the estimation and reporting of these <lb/>activities. <lb/>c) That the aim stated in Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Kyoto Protocol not be changed by accounting <lb/>for land use, land-use change and forestry activities. <lb/>d) That the mere presence of carbon stocks be excluded from accounting. <lb/>e) That the implementation of LULUCF activities contributes to the conservation of biodiversity <lb/>and sustainable use of natural resources. <lb/>f) That accounting for LULUCF does not imply a transfer of commitments to a future commitment <lb/>period. <lb/>g) That reversal of any removal due to LULUCF activities be accounted for at the appropriate point <lb/>in time. <lb/>h) That accounting excludes removals resulting from: (i) elevated carbon dioxide concentrations <lb/>above their pre-industrial level; (ii) indirect nitrogen deposition; and (iii) the dynamic effects of <lb/>age structure resulting from activities and practices before the reference year. <lb/>Accounting for emissions and removals in the land sector in the context of Annex B Party commitments <lb/>under the Kyoto Protocol is not only based on national GHG inventories. Rather, a set of anthropogenic <lb/>LULUCF activities was identified with an impact on GHG emissions or removals. This approach is known <lb/>as the &quot; activity-based &quot; approach. An activity-based approach to LULUCF accounting was chosen partly in <lb/>order to limit the risk of non-anthropogenic emissions and removals being counted towards the mitigation <lb/>commitments of Annex B Parties and to deal with the difficulties associated with legacy effects in the <lb/>forestry sector. Accounting is mandatory for some LULUCF activities and voluntary for others (as shown <lb/>in Table 2). <lb/>The accounting framework of the Kyoto Protocol has a robust reporting and review system. Colour-coded <lb/>common reporting format (CRF) tables are used for reporting which enhances clarity. Technical expert <lb/>reviews of GHG inventories, national communications and biennial reports of Annex I countries (as well <lb/>as a compliance process) provide confidence in the information reported. <lb/>The accounting system of the Kyoto Protocol has evolved between the first and second commitment <lb/>period. A major change was the introduction of Forest Management Reference Levels (FMRLs) to account <lb/>for forestry management in a way that could deal with legacy effects. In addition, forest management <lb/>became a mandatory activity and the scope of accounting was expanded to include wetland drainage and <lb/>rewetting. Further changes were made through other technical rules, such as provisions for treating natural <lb/>disturbances and harvested wood products (for further details see Canaveira, 2013, and Iversen et al., <lb/>2014). <lb/>Forest management reference levels were introduced for forest management activities in the second <lb/>commitment period in order to help Parties avoid the random effects that age-class distribution can have on <lb/>emissions and removals from forest management. FMRLS are baselines against which progress in <lb/>implementation of forest management activities is measured. Parties were given some flexibility in the <lb/>methodological approaches used to construct FMRLS. These FMRL were also reviewed by technical <lb/>experts in order to enhance their credibility. The significant impact of the technical review process was <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>reflected by the fact that at least 23 Parties out of 38 revised their FMRLS following the review (UNFCCC, <lb/>2011a). Despite some inconsistencies, the technical review concluded that the information provided by <lb/>Parties about the construction of the FRMLS was &quot; sufficiently transparent and thus fulfils most of the <lb/>required criteria &quot; (ibid.). <lb/>One of the challenges associated with LULUCF accounting under the Kyoto Protocol for the first <lb/>commitment period was that the LULUCF accounting provisions were negotiated after national <lb/>commitments to limit or reduce emissions had already been agreed. This provided an incentive for Parties <lb/>to negotiate accounting rules that would make it easier to meet their already-fixed emissions commitments. <lb/>Ideally, the POST-2020 accounting framework would be agreed before future commitments are finalised, <lb/>so that commitments are influenced by the accounting framework. Given the short time remaining, <lb/>however, it is unlikely that all of the details of the accounting framework will be agreed before intended <lb/>nationally determined contributions are put forward under the ADP. Therefore Section 4 of this paper <lb/>explores what could be agreed by 2015, and what could be worked on in 2016-2020. <lb/>REDD for developing countries <lb/>REDD+ provides recognition for enhanced action to combat deforestation and forest degradation as well as <lb/>conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon <lb/>stocks in developing countries (UNFCCC, 2010). Reducing or preventing deforestation has been identified <lb/>by the IPCC as the mitigation option with the most immediate and greatest effect on carbon stocks in the <lb/>short term, and is highly cost-effective (IPCC, 2014a). However, strong measurement, reporting and <lb/>verification (MRV) provisions are needed to ensure that emission reductions from REDD+ are real. As part <lb/>of the &quot; Warsaw Framework for REDD-plus &quot; , specific modalities for MRV were agreed upon (UNFCCC, <lb/>2013e). <lb/>Reference levels for forestry are used to measure progress on REDD+. In 2011, the COP invited REDD+ <lb/>countries to communicate their forest reference emissions levels and/or forest reference levels to the <lb/>UNFCCC Secretariat. The COP subsequently agreed in 2013 that each submission is to undergo a <lb/>technical assessment, to assess the degree to which the information provided is in accordance with the <lb/>reporting guidelines and to offer a &quot; facilitative, non-intrusive, technical exchange of information &quot; on the <lb/>reference levels (UNFCCC, 2013a). The first forest reference level was submitted by Brazil in June 2014 <lb/>(Government of Brazil, 2014). <lb/>REDD+ reporting provisions include social and environmental safeguards. A list of safeguards was <lb/>established at COP 16 and REDD+ Parties are to submit reports on how these safeguards are being <lb/>addressed and respected (UNFCCC, 2011b). Examples of safeguards include conservation of natural <lb/>forests and biological diversity as well as respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and <lb/>members of local communities. While the extent to which the current provisions for safeguards will have <lb/>an impact on the ground is yet to be seen, this could be an important step towards protecting the rights of <lb/>local communities and moving towards more open and inclusive forms of decision-making on important <lb/>land-related issues. <lb/>Reduced Emissions from All Land Uses (REALU) in developing countries <lb/>Expanding the scope of land sector reporting and accounting in developing countries over time could help <lb/>Parties to receive recognition for a greater range of the mitigation opportunities that exist in the sector, and <lb/>lead to more joined up policy-making. In particular, the agriculture sector needs to be covered by the <lb/>accounting framework in a way that does not compromise, or if possible enhances, food production. To <lb/>this end, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has developed a methodology for &quot; Reduced Emissions <lb/>from All Land Uses &quot; (REALU) in developing countries, and is currently exploring the feasibility of this <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>landscape approach in Cameroon, Indonesia, Peru and Vietnam. The REALU approach addresses the <lb/>partial accounting of REDD+ and the emission reduction potential in other land uses such as trees outside <lb/>forests. It is based on baselines and Reference Emission Levels (RELs) and aims at credit generation. <lb/>While development of the REALU methodology is taking place outside of the UNFCCC process, <lb/>proponents describe REALU as a possible stepping stone between REDD+ and broad land sector <lb/>accounting in the post-2020 period (see e.g. Bernard et al., 2013). <lb/>Project-level methodologies <lb/>There are currently two types of forestry sector projects (afforestation and reforestation activities) that can <lb/>be eligible to receive credits under the CDM. The credits generated by these projects can be purchased by <lb/>Annex B Parties and used to meet part of their commitments. The issue of non-permanence is dealt with by <lb/>the issuance of temporary Certified Emission Reduction units (tCERs or lCERs) to afforestation and <lb/>reforestation projects under the CDM. To date the number of such projects has been low (55 as of July <lb/>2014, representing around 2 Mt CO 2 -eq) and concentrated in a small number of countries (mainly <lb/>Colombia, India, Brazil, Moldova and China) (UNFCCC, 2014a). <lb/>CDM methodologies also exist for some agriculture-related projects addressing non-CO 2 gases. These <lb/>include manure management, methane avoidance/recovery, offsetting of nitrogen fertiliser use, use of <lb/>agriculture residues for energy production and reduced emissions from rice cultivation. There is also <lb/>experience in the voluntary carbon markets sector regarding project-level methodologies in the land sector. <lb/>The bottom-up nature of voluntary markets means that different mechanisms have different methodologies <lb/>and geographic scopes. <lb/>NAMAs under the Cancun Agreements <lb/>Many developing countries have put forward nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) in the <lb/>land sector for 2020 (and/or other years). The future land sector reporting and accounting system could <lb/>learn lessons from REDD+ and the process for NAMAs (Canaveira, 2013). While progress in <lb/>implementation of REDD+ activities is to be conducted via country-specific reference levels, many <lb/>countries have also chosen to express NAMAs as goals relative to &quot; business as usual &quot; baselines in 2020. It <lb/>is possible that these two approaches could be merged, with NAMAs providing &quot; broad economy-wide low-<lb/>emission development strategies &quot; and REDD+ activities forming part of this strategy (GIZ, 2013). <lb/>While REDD+ applies only to forestry-related activities, NAMAs can encompass almost any mitigation <lb/>activity and form, from economy-wide or sectoral emissions reduction goals and policies and measures to <lb/>individual projects and programmes. REDD+ activities themselves could be considered NAMAs. Land <lb/>sector NAMAs targeting the whole AFOLU sector could be significantly wider in scope than REDD+ <lb/>activities. Similar to the safeguards under REDD+, Parties could be invited to provide information about <lb/>other benefits of mitigation activities under the NAMA approach. <lb/>Aligning the approaches for the establishment of baselines for NAMAs and REDD+ could facilitate result-<lb/>based payments (GIZ, 2013). REDD+ and NAMAs both require a transparent MRV framework that could <lb/>be streamlined via the establishment of a national MRV framework including both approaches. COP 19 <lb/>further decided that the MRV for REDD+ should be coherent with guidance for the MRV for NAMAs <lb/>(UNFCCC, 2014b). <lb/>Agriculture <lb/>For Annex B Parties, anthropogenic GHG emissions from agriculture are covered by the reporting and <lb/>accounting framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Annex B Parties are to ensure that their emissions of the <lb/>gases listed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol do not exceed their assigned amounts. This annex includes, <lb/>20 <lb/>among other gases, CH 4 , N 2 O and CO 2 from enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation, <lb/>agricultural soils, prescribed burning of savannahs, and field burning of agricultural residues. Agriculture <lb/>is treated in the same way as other inventory categories under the KP. Further, there are a small number of <lb/>CDM methodologies available to quantify emission reductions from manure management, methane <lb/>recovery, offsetting nitrogen fertiliser use and rice cultivation projects in developing countries. <lb/>Most developed countries have clarified that agriculture will be included in their emissions reduction <lb/>targets for 2020 under the Cancun Agreements (UNFCCC, 2013b). Many non-Annex I Parties or groups of <lb/>Parties have communicated mitigation actions relating to agriculture under the Cancun Agreements (e.g. <lb/>the African Group, Chad, Colombia, Côte d&apos;Ivoire, Dominica, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Indonesia, <lb/>Jordan, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Swaziland, Tunisia) (UNFCCC, 2013c). However, in most cases <lb/>the precise scope of the actions and how they will be accounted for remains unclear. <lb/>An approach is needed for the post-2020 period that promotes mitigation action while taking into account <lb/>competing policy priorities such as food production. One possible solution would be for Parties to choose <lb/>to put forward mitigation actions in the agriculture sector using reference levels or intensity or productivity <lb/>metrics, such as GHG emissions per unit of agricultural output. Such approaches would take into account <lb/>the fact that absolute increases in GHG emissions from the agriculture sector are expected for some <lb/>countries in the short term, but Parties could still receive recognition under the 2015 agreement for taking <lb/>action to increase efficiency in this sector and decouple GHG emissions from output. <lb/>2.3 Special characteristics of the LULUCF part of the land sector <lb/>The LULUCF part of the land sector has a number of special features that distinguish it from emissions <lb/>from agriculture, energy, transport, industry and waste (Estrada et al., 2014). These features include <lb/>difficulty in separating anthropogenic from natural emissions and removals, strong legacy effects due to <lb/>structural features of forests, and potential reversals of GHG removals due to natural disturbances or <lb/>human activities. There tend to be high uncertainties in estimates of emissions and removals from <lb/>agriculture and LULUCF. Further, often there are also competing goods and services for the same land, <lb/>such as agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. <lb/>Identifying anthropogenic emissions and removals <lb/>The UNFCCC is focused on anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals. However, for LULUCF it can <lb/>be especially difficult to separate anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions and removals. This is <lb/>because the flows of emissions and removals through ecological systems are complex and it is difficult to <lb/>identify causality. For example, a wild fire can be indirectly affected by human activities such as former <lb/>harvesting activities or fire suppression, while a fire started by humans can be substantially influenced by <lb/>natural causes such as prior drought (IPCC, 2009). <lb/>The IPCC approach used to separate anthropogenic emissions and removals in GHG inventories is known <lb/>as the &quot; managed land proxy &quot; . The managed land proxy works by dividing the total land area into managed <lb/>and unmanaged land. Emissions and removals occurring on managed land are assumed to be <lb/>anthropogenic, while emissions and removals occurring on unmanaged land are assumed to be naturally <lb/>occurring. The IPCC definition of managed land is &quot; land where human interventions and practices have <lb/>been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions &quot; (IPCC, 2009). <lb/>This proxy is used since for LULUCF activities there is currently no practicable methodology available to <lb/>factor out direct anthropogenic effects from indirect anthropogenic and natural effects. Estimates of GHG <lb/>emissions and removals on managed lands are therefore used as a proxy for anthropogenic emissions and <lb/>removals. <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>Legacy effects <lb/>Patterns of harvesting and replanting can have significant impacts on forest-related anthropogenic GHG <lb/>emissions and removals over a given period. These impacts are known as legacy effects, since the impacts <lb/>can stem from past management decisions which affect the age-class structure of forests. Harvest activities <lb/>influence the carbon stock of forest ecosystems especially via the subsequent regrowth and higher <lb/>sequestration rates. Those effects can last for decades and can be greater than forest management activities <lb/>during a given period (Böttcher, Kurz and Freibauer, 2008). As a consequence, Parties implementing the <lb/>same management activities can have very different results depending on the age structure of their forest <lb/>ecosystems. Countries with a high percentage of forests can substantially benefit (or lose out) from past <lb/>harvesting activities. Legacy effects are most significant for forests, due to the long production cycles <lb/>involved, but can also be observed to a lesser extent in other systems such as croplands. <lb/>The treatment of legacy effects was part of the development of the accounting rules from the first to the <lb/>second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. For the second commitment period, forest <lb/>management is mandatory and Parties are able to incorporate legacy effects in the construction of projected <lb/>FMRLs. A significant advantage of projected reference levels is the avoidance of a so-called &quot; base year <lb/>lottery &quot; that creates advantages or disadvantages due to the emission level in the base year (Canaveira, <lb/>2013). <lb/>Previous CCXG work has highlighted that many different methods exist for developing baselines and <lb/>information on underlying assumptions is the key to understanding baselines (Clapp and Prag, 2012). <lb/>While various approaches to developing FMRLs can provide flexibility for Parties and therefore <lb/>incorporate a range of national circumstances, this variety also reduce the comparability of approaches <lb/>used (EDF, 2012). The approaches used by Parties for setting FMRLs in the second KP commitment <lb/>period were (UNFCCC, 2011a): <lb/>a) Projections using country-specific methodologies (17 Parties) <lb/>b) Projections using a common approach developed by the European Commission Joint Research <lb/>Centre (14 Parties) <lb/>c) Historical FMRL based on a single year (3 Parties) <lb/>d) Average emissions and removals during a historical time series (1 Party) <lb/>e) Linear extrapolation of a historical trend (2 Parties) <lb/>f) Setting the baseline to zero, known as &quot; gross–net accounting &quot; (1 Party) <lb/>Natural disturbances and reversals of CO 2 removals <lb/>The removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere by land sinks via photosynthesis is not necessarily a permanent <lb/>process. There are several means by which this process can be reversed and the stored carbon can be <lb/>released back into the atmosphere. These include the occurrence of natural disturbances, such as natural <lb/>fires or the outbreak of pests or a disease, or human activities, such as subsequent harvesting or land-use <lb/>change. Carbon stocks in the land sector are therefore said to have a high risk of &quot; non-permanence &quot; . <lb/>Examples of natural disturbances that have resulted in substantive GHG emissions from the land sector <lb/>include forest fires in Australia and bark beetle infestations in Canada. 7 <lb/>7 <lb/>The infestation of forests with bark beetles can lead to a high mortality of large areas of forests that causes significant <lb/>emissions. A pine beetle infestation in 2008 in Canada produced the same amount of carbon emissions as a five year <lb/>period of Canada&apos;s transport sector (Bateman, 2012). <lb/>22 <lb/>The frequency (and in some cases the severity) of natural disturbances for forests and soils is likely to <lb/>increase due to climate change (Seidl et al., 2014). For example, an outbreak of mountain pine beetle has <lb/>devastated 11 million hectares of forest in Canada and the US since the late 1990s. This significant <lb/>disturbance has been exacerbated by higher average winter temperatures, which are highly likely to be a <lb/>consequence of anthropogenic climate change (FAO, 2010). <lb/>The possibility of sequestration reversals by natural disturbances beyond the control of the Party concerned <lb/>can represent a significant risk to the achievement of mitigation targets or actions. Therefore special <lb/>provisions may be agreed to manage this risk. In the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol there <lb/>was no natural disturbances provision, other than the use of the managed land proxy. The issue of non-<lb/>permanence was dealt with in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol with the inclusion of a <lb/>so-called &quot; natural disturbance provision &quot; . The natural disturbance provision allows Parties to exclude <lb/>emissions from accounting resulting from events that are not &quot; materially influenced &quot; by the Party and <lb/>thereby guarantees that Parties are not penalised for nature-induced emissions (UNFCCC, 2011c). The <lb/>removals following the disturbance are also excluded. <lb/>To be eligible to use the natural disturbances provision, a Party must include information in its 2015 <lb/>national inventory report on the background level of emissions from natural disturbances included in its <lb/>FMRL. In order to be excluded from accounting, emissions from a natural disturbance must exceed a <lb/>background level (plus a margin, if applicable), and no land-use change can take place after the natural <lb/>disturbance. Reporting requirements help to ensure that this provision is not &quot; gamed &quot; . The natural <lb/>disturbances provision only applies to afforestation, reforestation and forest management activities. A <lb/>disadvantage of the natural disturbances provision is that emissions from substantial land areas may not be <lb/>accounted for (Funk, 2014). <lb/>It is possible that the natural disturbances provision could be expanded to other activities and lands such as <lb/>cropland and grassland, as well as draught (Canaveira, 2013). There could also be a single natural <lb/>disturbance provision for all IPCC forest categories, rather than separate provisions for separate lands and <lb/>activities (Estrada et. al, 2014). An expansion of that provision would require further guidance on <lb/>emissions resulting from natural disturbances, since the only guidance to date on forest-related emissions <lb/>under the Kyoto Protocol is in the IPCC 2013 KP Supplement. This guidance only applies to Annex B <lb/>Parties and there is currently no guidance for non-KP Parties or developing countries (Iversen et al., 2014). <lb/>An exclusion of the natural disturbances provision within the new climate agreement might lead reduced <lb/>ambition by Parties with high risk of natural disturbance (Estrada et al. 2014). According to Funk (2014), <lb/>the voluntary option for excluding natural disturbances could be maintained under the condition of <lb/>adopting &quot; robust criteria and strong review &quot; . <lb/>Non-permanence is also an issue if credits for stored carbon have been issued via a project-based <lb/>mechanism such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and used to offset emissions elsewhere. In <lb/>order to deal with the potential reversibility of land-carbon stocks, afforestation and reforestation projects <lb/>under the CDM are issued special credits known as temporary certified emissions reductions (tCERs) or <lb/>long-term CERs (lCERs). Temporary CERs expire at the end of the commitment period in which they are <lb/>issued, and have to be replaced. Long-term CERs expire at the end of a crediting period (which can be up <lb/>to 30 years, or 20+20+20 years), with verification every five years that reversals have not occurred. <lb/>The additional risk of having credits that may need to be replaced in future leads to a lower market price <lb/>for credits from afforestation and reforestation projects compared to conventional CDM projects. There are <lb/>ongoing discussions in the UNFCCC regarding alternative approaches to deal with the risk of non-<lb/>permanence in the context of the CDM. The issue of non-permanence has yet to be addressed in the <lb/>context of REDD+. While LULUCF accounting encompasses both credits and debits, under REDD+ only <lb/>reductions in emissions have so far been recognised, although further rules could emerge in future. <lb/></body>

			<body>High uncertainty and inter-annual variability <lb/>There is some uncertainty associated with estimates of anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals in any <lb/>sector. Due to the complex nature of the land sector, however, which comprises a diffuse set of linked <lb/>ecosystems on land and in the soil, emissions and removals from this sector are particularly difficult to <lb/>estimate accurately. This is not simply a reflection of different levels of national capacity for measuring <lb/>and reporting – there can be significant uncertainty associated with data (both in terms of activity data and <lb/>emission factors) for developed countries with high capacity, as well as for developing countries with low <lb/>capacity. Further, annual fluctuations in anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals from LULUCF can <lb/>be significantly greater than those for other sectors. In some cases, for example, LULUCF can go from <lb/>being a net sink one year to a net source the next. <lb/>Annex I countries perform an uncertainty calculation as part of their annual national inventory reports. <lb/>Information is provided on the activity data uncertainty, the emission or removal factor uncertainty, and the <lb/>combined uncertainty for each emissions source or sink in the inventory as well as the overall uncertainty <lb/>in the national total and in the national trend. In the case of New Zealand&apos;s 2014 GHG inventory, <lb/>containing data for the year 2012, the combined uncertainty associated with CO 2 emissions from liquid <lb/>fuels was 3%. By contrast, the combined uncertainty was 16% for CH 4 emissions from enteric <lb/>fermentation, 30% for CH 4 emissions from manure management, 54% for CO 2 emissions from forest land, <lb/>74% for N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils, and up to 100% for N 2 O emissions from manure <lb/>management (New Zealand Government, 2014a). <lb/>The extent to which this uncertainty translates to uncertainty in total anthropogenic GHG emissions <lb/>depends on the relative weights of each source or sink in a country&apos;s total emissions, and uncertainty is <lb/>reduced because uncorrelated uncertainties do not add linearly. Furthermore the uncertainty on a trend is <lb/>generally smaller than the absolute uncertainty in any year. Nevertheless, there is generally greater <lb/>uncertainty associated with the GHG inventories of Parties for which AFOLU accounts for a high share of <lb/>total anthropogenic GHG emissions, and lower uncertainty for Parties for which AFOLU accounts for only <lb/>a low share of total emissions. <lb/>While the levels of uncertainty for estimates of emissions and removals from the land sector are relatively <lb/>high, advances in remote sensing technology for tracking land-use change are helping to reduce them. In <lb/>particular, the use of satellites is revolutionising this area. Some data are already freely-available from <lb/>space agencies and the next generation of earth observation satellites will provide open access to advanced, <lb/>high-resolution land-use mapping tools (Box 1). <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 1: Recent developments in satellite remote sensing technology and tracking initiatives for land sector <lb/>observations <lb/>As part of the Copernicus space programme being undertaken by the European Commission and the European Space Agency <lb/>(ESA), the ESA is launching a new family of missions called Sentinels (ESA, 2014). Each mission consists of two satellites <lb/>carrying a range of different technologies and imaging instruments for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Sentinel-1 <lb/>was launched in April 2014 and will provide free and open access data for the monitoring of forest, water, soil and <lb/>agriculture lands. The twin satellites, orbiting 180° apart, will image the entire Earth once every six days, with a spatial <lb/>resolution of up to 5x5 m. Sentinel-1 will enable accurate tracking of changes in land use over time, in particular detection of <lb/>forest clearing and partial clearing, forest type classification, biomass estimation, disturbance detection and forest fire <lb/>mapping, as well as monitoring of agricultural crop conditions, soil properties and tillage activities. <lb/>In January 2014, the Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI) published a Methods and Guidance Document (MGD) <lb/>(GFOI, 2013). The MGD systematically sets out for the first time how the impact of REDD+ activities can be estimated <lb/>using IPCC methodologies. The MGD was developed by UN-REDD, the World Bank Forest Carbon Partnership Facility <lb/>(FCPF), the space agencies and other land sector experts. The space agencies have agreed to make freely available (via a <lb/>specially established Space Data Coordination Group) remotely sensed data from a set of core missions identified in the <lb/>MGD, including Landsat (which has the most extensive archive of historical data relevant to REDD+) and Sentinel. <lb/>Global Forest Watch (GFW), convened by the World Resource Institute, is an online monitoring tool and alert system <lb/>providing timely data about global forest loss (WRI, 2014a). The tool was established in February 2014. Using satellite <lb/>technology and cloud-computing power, GFW provides maps showing current forest management as well as protected areas <lb/>with a 500 m resolution, including global forest change maps produced by the University of Maryland using Landsat data. A <lb/>unique asset of GFW is its crowdsourcing function that allows users to upload and share data and build networks and <lb/>coalitions within the GFW. In July 2014, a new program called Global Forest Watch Fires was launched in collaboration <lb/>with the National REDD+ Agency of Indonesia (WRI, 2014b). It monitors and reacts to fires in South East Asia by using a <lb/>SMS alert system. <lb/>Peru launched a high-resolution map of its land-carbon stocks in July 2014 – the first map of its kind on a national scale <lb/>(Carnegie Institution for Science, 2014). The team constructing the map combined data from an integrated airborne laser <lb/>mapping technology developed by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory with publicly available satellite maps of forest cover <lb/>and other land uses. The result is a 3D map showing carbon density at up to a 1x1 m resolution. The total carbon stock was <lb/>estimated to be around 6.9 billion tonnes, with the largest stocks located in the northern Peruvian Amazon and along the <lb/>Brazil-Peru border. <lb/>3. Possible elements of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and <lb/>accounting <lb/>This section lays out possible elements of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and accounting. The <lb/>aim of this exercise is to outline possible elements for a long-term vision to work back from, as a means to <lb/>generate discussion on the issue. Other ways forward are no doubt possible. The precise time frame of the <lb/>vision is not specified. The full vision might not be attained by 2020. Parties could agree to a shared <lb/>direction of travel along various dimensions of the accounting framework, such as agreement to increase <lb/>the comprehensiveness of accounting over time. <lb/>3.1 Possible elements of a long-term vision <lb/>The long-term aim of post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting could be to create a multi-<lb/>dimensional reporting and accounting framework that is applicable to all Parties and increases the <lb/>comprehensiveness of reporting and accounting over time. The possible elements of a long-term vision for <lb/>land sector reporting and accounting identified in this paper include generic elements (i.e. elements that are <lb/>relevant to all sectors) and land-specific elements (i.e. elements that are relevant to the land sector only). <lb/>The elements include: <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>Generic elements (relevant to all sectors) <lb/>• Use of IPCC 2006 Guidelines by all Parties (with flexibility for least developed countries and <lb/>small island developing states) for reporting key sources and sinks, with different Parties using <lb/>different tiers for different sources and sinks, according to capacity. <lb/> • Increasing quality and accuracy of reporting for land sector sources and sinks (i.e. using higher <lb/>IPCC tiers for key categories where possible). <lb/> • Provision of up-front information alongside intended nationally determined contributions that <lb/>promotes transparency, clarity and understanding. <lb/> • Flexibility in some aspects of the reporting and accounting framework and acceptance of <lb/>different entry points for different countries, to accommodate the different national circumstances <lb/>and capacities of countries. <lb/> • Focus on cost-effective reporting and accounting.<lb/>• Recognition of need of means of implementation to increase reporting and accounting capacity in <lb/>developing countries.<lb/>Land-specific elements (relevant to the land sector only) <lb/>• Increasing coverage over successive cycles of nationally determined contributions for accounting <lb/>of anthropogenic sources and sinks (with existing comprehensive accounting of non-CO 2 <lb/> emissions from agriculture to continue for Annex B Parties). <lb/> • Provisions to address age-class structure effects in forests and the risk of natural disturbances and <lb/>reversals of sequestered carbon from forests and other land sinks. <lb/> • Use of a &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule for coverage of sources and sinks.<lb/>• Accommodate mitigation contributions expressed relative to reference levels or using intensity <lb/>metrics relating to agriculture, forestry and soils, with a view to providing cost-effective <lb/>accounting options that take into account national circumstances. <lb/> • Technical assessment of reference levels where appropriate to increase confidence in the baselines <lb/>against which progress is tracked. <lb/> • Reporting of qualitative information on a Parties&apos; vision for the land sector and the multiple <lb/>benefits of policies and environmental and social safeguards (where applicable), to complement <lb/>the quantitative accounting framework.<lb/>Reporting can provide the technical information necessary to undertake accounting. Information on <lb/>anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals could be reported on a regular basis (e.g. annually) by all <lb/>Parties, perhaps with additional flexibility for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island <lb/>Developing States (SIDSs). Reports would be prepared in accordance with IPCC methodologies agreed by <lb/>the COP (as for other sectors). Use of 2006 IPCC guidelines for inventory reporting by all Parties would <lb/>help to ensure that the information on which accounting is based is transparent, accurate, consistent, <lb/>comparable and complete. The IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories are periodically updated and <lb/>expanded to reflect the latest developments in scientific understanding and data availability. <lb/>An effective future land sector reporting and accounting framework would have broad coverage of key <lb/>sources and sinks of anthropogenic GHGs from agriculture, forestry and other land uses. This would help <lb/>to avoid selective inclusion of anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals for certain types of land or <lb/>activities, or &quot; cherry-picking &quot; , by governments. It would ensure that the reporting and accounting <lb/></body>

			<body>framework best represents all anthropogenic emissions and removals without creating perverse outcomes, <lb/>and incentivises governments to take a holistic approach to land sector mitigation (Canaveira, 2013). This <lb/>in turn could help to minimise indirect emissions caused by the shifting of emissions-intensive activities <lb/>from one area inside the accounting framework to another outside it (e.g. in the case of bioenergy). <lb/>Regarding the total area of land covered, countries could be encouraged to report the quantity of <lb/>unmanaged land in their jurisdictions as a matter of best practice, to enable a complete picture of land-use <lb/>changes to be built up over time (Canaveira, 2013). <lb/>Some aspects of the land sector reporting and accounting framework would continue to be flexible in order <lb/>to take into account the different national circumstances and reporting and accounting capacities of <lb/>countries. There are different ways in which flexibility could be included, such as: <lb/>• How the land sector is treated within nationally determined contributions (with a view to moving <lb/>towards broad coverage of key sources over time). <lb/> • The definitions used of terms such as &quot; forest &quot; (although these might be within a range of values, <lb/>e.g. for percentage tree cover). <lb/> • The designation of areas of managed and unmanaged land.<lb/>• The approach used to determine the baseline or reference level against which progress in <lb/>implementation will be measured. <lb/> • The possibility to expand the use of reference levels to other land management activities (i.e. <lb/>beyond forest management) within the overall framework being adopted for nationally determined <lb/>contributions.<lb/>While some flexibility will be necessary in order to create a reporting and accounting framework that is <lb/>applicable to all Parties, there is also a risk that too much flexibility could result in Parties claiming <lb/>emissions reductions that are not real or additional. The agreement of a shared direction of travel for land <lb/>sector accounting, combined with the &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule, could help to ensure the environmental <lb/>integrity of mitigation efforts. <lb/>Given the widely varying national circumstances of different Parties, it may be difficult to agree a single <lb/>approach for setting baselines or reference levels for all nationally determined contributions in the land <lb/>sector. While different Parties could use different approaches for establishing reference levels (e.g. <lb/>historical base years, simple extrapolations of recent trends, advanced projections), a high level of <lb/>transparency would help to increase clarity and understanding of the baselines or reference levels used. <lb/>Decision 12/CP.17 calls for developing countries to provide &quot; transparent &quot; and &quot; complete &quot; information on <lb/>their forest reference levels and/or forest reference emissions levels, including historical data used to <lb/>construct the reference level, data sets or assumptions used, a description of changes since the previous <lb/>submission, the definition of forest used, and reasons why significant pools or activities were omitted if <lb/>applicable (UNFCCC, 2011d). Similar data could be provided in the post-2020 period. <lb/>Projected reference levels can be used to factor out non-anthropogenic impacts such as CO 2 fertilisation <lb/>and nitrogen deposition but also imply high uncertainties regarding projected harvesting levels. While the <lb/>use of reference levels so far only applies to forest management, an expansion of this approach to other <lb/>land sector categories is possible if consistent with the overall approach being adopted for national <lb/>contributions. <lb/>The processes established for technical assessment of FMRLs under the Kyoto Protocol and forest <lb/>reference levels and forest reference emissions levels for developing countries under REDD+ have helped <lb/>27 <lb/>to build confidence in the accuracy of the information provided. Similar technical review cycles could be <lb/>continued in the post-2020 period. <lb/>Mitigation in the land sector cannot be a substitute for action to reduce emissions from fossil fuel <lb/>combustion. Deep and cost-effective cuts in GHG emissions from all sectors are needed if the below 2 °C <lb/>long-term global goal is to be kept within reach. In the case of economy-wide nationally determined <lb/>contributions, the inclusion of the land sector within a well-designed and cost-effective reporting and <lb/>accounting framework should enable Parties to achieve more ambitious mitigation goals and not provide <lb/>accounting loopholes or otherwise weaken the level of ambition of nationally determined contributions. <lb/>Accounting in the context of the Kyoto Protocol is mainly focused on quantitative data on anthropogenic <lb/>GHG emissions and removals, as well as GHG units from market mechanisms or other metrics for <lb/>measuring progress in implementation of mitigation targets and actions (Hood, Briner and Rocha, 2014). <lb/>However, one of the guiding principles for LULUCF accounting under the Kyoto Protocol is that &quot; the <lb/>implementation of [LULUCF] activities contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use <lb/>of resources &quot; (UNFCCC, 2005). While the accounting framework itself may focus on mitigation only, a <lb/>well-designed framework can incentivise actions with other benefits, such as climate-friendly urban land <lb/>planning, ecosystem-based adaptation and climate-smart agriculture (Box 2). In addition to climate change <lb/>benefits, such actions could contribute towards achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) <lb/>currently being developed following the Rio+20 conference in 2012. As of August 2014, the draft list of <lb/>possible SDGs includes goals to promote sustainable agriculture, make cities resilient and sustainable, <lb/>sustainably manage forests, and halt land degradation and biodiversity loss (UN, 2014). <lb/>Reporting qualitative information on multiple benefits alongside the quantitative accounting framework <lb/>could encourage countries to adopt policies with multiple benefits and provide recognition for such <lb/>policies. Several Parties, including Brazil, China, the Philippines, the EU, the US and Japan, have <lb/>highlighted the importance of incentivising non-carbon benefits in recent UNFCCC submissions on <lb/>REDD+ (UNFCCC, 2014c). In some cases, these benefits may contribute to the permanence of forests by <lb/>decreasing the risk of reversals (WWF, 2014). <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 2: Reporting of qualitative information relating to the land sector <lb/>As a complement to the quantitative accounting framework, qualitative information could be reported in the following areas: <lb/>•  Urban land planning <lb/> •  Ecosystem-based adaptation <lb/> •  Climate-smart agriculture <lb/> •  Climate-resilient landscapes <lb/> •  Social and environmental safeguards (where appropriate)<lb/>A key driver of land-use change is the rapid expansion of cities in many regions, also known as urban sprawl, which is <lb/>influenced by urban land planning. Since the 1950s, the urban land area in non-OECD countries has increased fivefold <lb/>(OECD, 2009) and the demand for land for built-up areas is expected to increase faster than the actual population size in 30 <lb/>of 34 OECD countries (OECD, 2012). Urban areas are vulnerable to impacts from climate change due to their location (often <lb/>on the coast), infrastructure, and warming is amplified within cities due to the urban heat island effect (OECD, 2009). Urban <lb/>land planning should incorporate climate change considerations and aim at decreasing future land consumption. The <lb/>introduction of policies fostering urban densification, e.g. via a BAU baseline or emission intensity per capita, can lead to <lb/>significant reductions in anthropogenic GHG emissions. This concept of &quot; compact cities &quot; also has wider social and <lb/>economic benefits and can thereby contribute to sustainability within an urban context. <lb/>Ecosystem-based adaptation acknowledges the role of biodiversity and ecosystem services in building and enhancing <lb/>resilience and reducing vulnerability. Examples include wetland restoration and biodiversity conservation (Adaptation <lb/>Committee, 2013). Climate-smart agriculture aims at enlarging agricultural productivity in a sustainable matter, while <lb/>reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change. Examples of climate-smart agriculture include reduced or no <lb/>tillage with direct seeding and permanent soil cover, or better drought management for example by use of manure (FAO, <lb/>2013). <lb/>Climate-resilient landscapes are part of a broader landscape approach which puts emphasis on maintaining or achieving a <lb/>healthy ecosystem for the provision of ecosystem services. Climate-resilient landscapes are able to absorb shocks and <lb/>changes of climate without losing its functionality (Sekhran, 2010). A recent conference on &quot; Landscapes for People, Food <lb/>and Nature in Africa &quot; highlighted the need for integrated landscapes that address the inter-linked challenges of food security, <lb/>ecosystem services, biodiversity, climate change and water (Esipisu, 2014). Such solutions include scaling up landscape-<lb/>level interventions such as terracing, agroforestry, reforestation, cultivation of local varieties, landslide prevention, riverbank <lb/>stabilisation and watershed management (Munang, 2014). The 2015 agreement could encourage Parties to pursue national <lb/>strategies that promote non-carbon benefits and to share information on these benefits with other Parties in the UNFCCC. <lb/>Social and environmental safeguards aim to protect the rights of indigenous peoples and other stakeholders whose <lb/>livelihoods depend on the land sector. These safeguards would mainly apply to forestry-related supported actions and could <lb/>build upon the set of safeguards established for REDD+ at COP 16 (UNFCCC, 2010). These include provisions such as <lb/>ensuring that actions are consistent with national programmes, that governments respect the knowledge and rights of <lb/>indigenous peoples, that stakeholder participation is full and effective, and that actions conserve natural ecosystems and <lb/>protect biodiversity <lb/>3.2 A shared direction of travel for land sector reporting and accounting <lb/>A foundation for the post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting framework could be for all Parties to <lb/>agree a shared direction of travel in terms of increasing the quality of reporting while widening the <lb/>coverage of accounting over time (Figure 1). While these are two important dimensions of the reporting <lb/>and accounting framework, Table 5 outlines some of the other possible dimensions. The new reporting and <lb/>accounting framework should build on what is already in place under the Convention and the Kyoto <lb/>Protocol, taking into account the strengths of each system. The land sector reporting and accounting <lb/>framework will be an important component of the broader accounting framework, which would address <lb/>other issues such as the MRV of information on actions and support and the use of market and non-market <lb/>mechanisms. <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>Figure 1. A shared direction of travel for land sector accounting <lb/>Countries might progress along each the dimensions outlined in Table 5 independently. There would be no <lb/>fixed order in which dimensions are to be addressed: some Parties might choose to expand their coverage <lb/>first, others might focus on using higher IPCC tiers first, etc. While there would be flexibility in terms of <lb/>how Parties address these dimensions, and different Parties may choose different pathways, the shared <lb/>direction of travel would be common to all Parties. The process would be iterative, with Parties starting at <lb/>different points and improving from there. <lb/>Parties with lower capacity would use lower IPCC reporting tiers, relying heavily on default emissions <lb/>factors. Data availability is likely to be limited in terms of geographical coverage and time, perhaps <lb/>covering one or two regions with long gaps between years for which data is available. The coverage of <lb/>reporting and accounting would depend on national capacity and experience. The provision of finance, <lb/>technology and capacity building activities, such as training courses for staff to learn how to use land <lb/>sector monitoring technologies and data processing software, would be crucial for low capacity countries <lb/>to increase the comprehensiveness of their land sector accounting. <lb/>Quality and <lb/>accuracy of <lb/>data used for <lb/>accounting <lb/>Coverage of accounting for <lb/>key sources and sinks <lb/>Broad <lb/>Narrow <lb/>High IPCC tiers <lb/>Low IPCC tiers <lb/></body>

Cost-effectiveness can also enable mitigation <lb/>accounting to accommodate multiple land-use objectives. <lb/>Parties with greater coverage of key sources and sinks and higher quality and accuracy of data <lb/>(corresponding to higher IPCC tiers) could consider expanding the coverage of land sector accounting and <lb/>putting forward nationally determined contributions expressed relative to sectoral baselines or reference <lb/>levels. Parties with the greatest capacity would use Tier 2 or Tier 3 IPCC methodologies and make use of <lb/>advanced monitoring technologies coupled with in-house analytical expertise. <lb/>4. Near-term steps to COP 21 and beyond <lb/>This section outlines some near-term steps and decisions that could be taken at COP 20 and beyond to put <lb/>governments on a path towards achieving the long-term vision set out in Section 3. A significant upcoming <lb/>event in the UNFCCC calendar will be COP 21 in Paris in 2015, at which a new protocol, another legal <lb/>instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force is to be adopted. The 2015 agreement could outline the <lb/>foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting, with more detailed principles and/or <lb/>guidelines to be agreed subsequently in the period 2016-2020. <lb/></note>

			<body>4.1 COP 20, Lima <lb/>Parties could agree at COP 20 what up-front information specific to the land sector is to be provided <lb/>alongside intended nationally determined contributions (which are to be communicated by the first quarter <lb/>of 2015 by Parties ready to do so). Given the diverse nature of nationally determined contributions, up-<lb/>front information will play an important role in increasing understanding, clarity and transparency of the <lb/>actions proposed. <lb/>The up-front information needed to understand mitigation targets and goals is outlined in Briner and Prag <lb/>(2013) and Levin et al. (2014). In the case of nationally determined contributions expressed relative to <lb/>baselines or reference levels (which could be economy-wide contributions, contributions in the land sector <lb/>only, or for sub-sectors within an economy-wide contribution), up-front information on the assumptions <lb/>underpinning the baselines or reference levels is needed in order to understand the expected impact of the <lb/>contributions. For land sector contributions in the form of qualitative policies and measures in developing <lb/>countries, information could be provided on how evidence of progress in implementation will be measured, <lb/>reported and domestically verified. <lb/>The provisions for up-front information could also provide an opportunity to report non-carbon benefits of <lb/>the actions proposed. For the land sector, these could include ecosystem-based adaptation, climate-smart <lb/>agriculture and the creation of climate-resilient landscapes. Such information would help to provide <lb/>context for how nationally determined contributions fit within broader visions for the land sector, as well <lb/>as links between mitigation and adaptation components. <lb/>There is currently no formal work stream for discussing post-2020 land sector accounting issues under the <lb/>ADP. A space for negotiations on this issue under the ADP is needed if the 2015 agreement is to contain <lb/>provisions relating to land sector reporting and accounting. At COP 20 in Lima in December 2014, <lb/>therefore, Parties could agree to establish a work stream or other formal venue to start discussions on this <lb/>important topic. <lb/>4.2 COP 21, Paris <lb/>At COP 21 in Paris, Parties are to adopt the 2015 agreement which will lay out the shape of the post-2020 <lb/>international regime for tackling climate change. The agreement itself may leave some technical details <lb/>regarding the accounting framework to be agreed subsequently in 2016-2020. <lb/>Parties could agree at COP 21 on the foundations (e.g. underlying principles and/or guidance) for post-<lb/>2020 land sector reporting and accounting. In particular, Parties could agree on the direction of travel for <lb/>land sector reporting and accounting and put the negotiations on a path towards achieving the long-term <lb/>vision outlined in Section 3. Possible foundations that could be included in the 2015 agreement are <lb/>outlined below. <lb/>Reporting <lb/>• The quality of GHG inventories should be improved over time, with a view to achieving annual <lb/>GHG inventories of key sources and sinks by all Parties (with flexibility for LDCs and SIDSs). <lb/>Parties are to use the 2006 IPCC Guidelines when preparing GHG inventories, to ensure that the <lb/>reported information is as transparent, accurate, complete, consistent and comparable as possible. <lb/>Some developing countries may need enhanced support in terms of finance, technology and <lb/>capacity building to increase their GHG inventory capacity. <lb/> • GHG inventories are to be reviewed or analysed by technical experts, in order to increase <lb/>confidence in the information reported and accelerate the inventory improvement process.<lb/>32 <lb/>• Qualitative information on landscape management strategies and progress in non-mitigation <lb/>policy areas (such as ecosystem-based adaptation, biodiversity conservation and food security) <lb/>should be reported in national communications and biennial (update) reports to complement the <lb/>quantitative accounting framework. In the case of some supported actions in developing <lb/>countries, qualitative information on social and environmental safeguards should be reported.<lb/>Accounting <lb/>• The direction of travel for all Parties should be towards increased coverage over time of key <lb/>categories of anthropogenic GHG sources and sinks from agriculture, forestry and other land-use <lb/>change in accounting for mitigation contributions, taking into account the different starting points <lb/>and capabilities of Parties. <lb/> • The &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule is to be applied to accounting for land sector sub-sectors.<lb/>• Both GHG emissions and removals from the land sector are to be accounted for.<lb/>• Accounting approaches are to be cost-effective and avoid perverse incentives (see e.g. New <lb/>Zealand, 2014b). <lb/> • Technical assessment cycles are to be established for the baselines or reference levels used for <lb/>accounting purposes, with the aim of increasing confidence in the baselines or reference levels <lb/>against which progress in implementation is measured.<lb/>4.3 2016-2020 <lb/>In an ideal world, the rules and details of a reporting and accounting framework would be agreed before <lb/>the intended nationally determined contributions themselves are put forward. However, given the short <lb/>time remaining until COP 21, these processes may need to take place in parallel and negotiations on some <lb/>details could continue in the period 2016-2020. Issues that could continue to be worked on in 2016-2020 <lb/>include: guidance for reference levels (including how these could promote sustainable development), <lb/>treatment of non-permanence and natural disturbances, identification of anthropogenic emissions and <lb/>removals, and the role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms under the UNFCCC. <lb/>A distinction can be made between tools and rules. For example, IPCC Guidelines can be considered a set <lb/>of tools designed to increase the accuracy and comparability of GHG inventories. The COP subsequently <lb/>adopted rules stipulating which IPCC Guidelines are to be used by which Parties. Similarly, it could be <lb/>helpful to develop a set of additional tools in 2016-2020 that facilitate land sector reporting and accounting <lb/>by all Parties. In the absence of agreement of rules on land sector reporting and accounting, Parties could <lb/>opt in to use such tools voluntarily. Such tools could be developed by non-State actors through consultative <lb/>processes and subsequently adopted as de facto standards by the UNFCCC process later. For example, <lb/>guidelines developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre were used voluntarily by 14 <lb/>countries to calculate their FMRLs for the second commitment period (UNFCCC, 2011a). <lb/>Guidance for reference levels <lb/>Reference levels could be used to measure progress in implementation of post-2020 nationally determined <lb/>contributions. In particular, the use of reference levels can help to minimise the impact of legacy effects <lb/>and age-class structure for forestry and can potentially be used more broadly to accommodate multiple land <lb/>use objectives, for example by accommodating food production emissions within baselines. Guidance for <lb/>reference levels could be developed in 2016-2020, building on existing guidance for FMRLs under the <lb/>Kyoto Protocol and forest reference levels/forest emissions reference levels for REDD+. A starting point <lb/>could be to identify the elements needed for the construction of reference levels, as well as what should be <lb/>included and what excluded. These elements can include historical data from GHG inventories, policy base <lb/></body>

			<body>year, age-class structure (for forests), factoring out anthropogenic effects from natural ones, activities <lb/>already undertaken (if applicable), projected activities under business-as-usual, and continuity of previous <lb/>activities (Hood, Briner and Rocha, 2014). Guidance would also be needed on aspects such as whether new <lb/>forest or reduced deforestation should be credited, and if so, how much time should pass until they are <lb/>included in the reference level. Countries could also be encouraged to design baselines that create <lb/>synergies with sustainable development and climate change adaptation, while avoiding perverse incentives <lb/>for land management activities. <lb/>Some Parties could also decide to construct reference levels for non-forestry activities, such as agriculture, <lb/>revegetation, cropland management, grazing land management and wetland drainage and rewetting. On <lb/>one hand, a &quot; reference levels for all &quot; approach could provide flexibility and comparability, and new <lb/>lands/activities could be added incrementally (Hood, Briner and Rocha, 2014). On the other hand, Estrada <lb/>et al. (2014) point out that expanding the reference level idea to other categories could increase <lb/>inconsistency with the type of contribution that a country is adopting for other sectors. <lb/>Non-permanence and natural disturbances <lb/>Options to deal with non-permanence and the risk of reversals of CO 2 removals from forestry and other <lb/>land use are given below. The first two are more relevant to national-scale commitments, the others to <lb/>projects: <lb/>• Use of GHG inventories as the basis for accounting, with removals counted as removals in the <lb/>year they occur, and any subsequent reversals counted as emissions in the year they occur. This <lb/>would be the simplest and most practical option, but may lead to less ambitious headline numbers <lb/>for nationally determined contributions (Estrada et al., 2014). <lb/> • Use of a natural disturbances provision, whereby emissions resulting from a natural disturbance <lb/>may be reported but not accounted for by the Party concerned. By 2020, experience will already <lb/>have been accrued with this approach from the second commitment period under the Kyoto <lb/>Protocol. <lb/> • Use of a buffer of GHG emissions reductions from forestry and other land-use changes that is <lb/>backed up by national governments (Ellis, 2001). When emissions reductions from forestry and <lb/>other land use are achieved, a share of the units generated could be set aside in a buffer. In the <lb/>event of a reversal, units from the buffer could be used to make up the shortfall. While this option <lb/>has been proposed for project-based mechanisms such as the CDM (UNFCCC, 2014d), the <lb/>concept could also be implemented at larger (e.g. sub-national) scales (see Box 3). <lb/> • Issuance of temporary GHG units for removals from forestry and other land-use changes, for use <lb/>by the Party concerned to meet its contribution or to be sold to another Party (Ellis, 2001). These <lb/>temporary units could expire at the end of the contribution period, or remain valid at the end of <lb/>the contribution period if there is verification that no removals have occurred. <lb/> • Use of insurance mechanisms, whereby the risk of reversals is underwritten by a third party for a <lb/>fee (Murray et al., 2012). In the event of a reversal, the insurance company would make a <lb/>payment to the Party concerned, and this money could be used to finance an equivalent quantity <lb/>of emissions reductions elsewhere. The inclusion of a third party in the process could result in <lb/>higher transaction fees and the insurance company could contest the fact that the reversal was <lb/>beyond the control of the Party concerned.<lb/></body>

			<body>Forests are subject to natural disturbances and other changes in forest carbon cycles which remain <lb/>unforeseeable. In order to ensure environmental integrity under a carbon credit regime, buffers can be used as <lb/>part of a comprehensive risk strategy. Buffers are set-aside emission reductions that can be utilised to <lb/>compensate reversals. There are several risks that have emerged under REDD+ that could be addressed via <lb/>buffering mechanisms, including: <lb/>•  risk of leakage<lb/>•  unclear land tenure<lb/>•  risk of methodological errors<lb/>•  incorrect assumptions for the construction of reference levels or a MRV framework.<lb/>Emission reductions that are reserved in a buffer pool could be used in the following cases: <lb/>•  a natural disturbance such as fire causing a reversal<lb/>•  a major mistake in a Party&apos;s accounting system – the buffer could be used to reduce issued emission<lb/>reductions while not affecting traded emission reductions <lb/>•  a strong increase in deforestation in neighboring countries which could lead to leakage – in this case<lb/>countries could pool their buffers to share risk. <lb/>If none of the above risks occur, buffered emission reductions can be converted into credited emission <lb/>reductions after a certain period of time. Further, in the event of a change to a more ambitious global mitigation <lb/>goal, a country could choose to cancel part of its buffer. The use of buffers is comparable to a risk insurance <lb/>system that can incentivise non-carbon benefits. Estimating appropriate buffers can be problematic but if <lb/>recurring over-or under-estimation occurs the buffer can be adjusted accordingly. <lb/>Source: Bucki, 2014; Ellis, 2001 <lb/>Identification of anthropogenic emissions and removals <lb/>The concept of managed and unmanaged land is currently used as a proxy for anthropogenic and natural <lb/>emissions and removals. Options for estimating anthropogenic emissions and removals in the future <lb/>include (IPCC, 2009): <lb/>• Continued use of the managed land proxy.<lb/>• Quantification of the contribution of different drivers towards emissions and removals in the land <lb/>sector. Scientific methods for doing this are being developed. <lb/> • Comparison between two or more modelled time series representing different levels of human <lb/>land management. <lb/> • Use of default emissions factors for human and natural processes, together with improved <lb/>statistical detection and attribution techniques (known as &quot; optimal fingerprinting &quot; ). <lb/> • Expanded use of the activity-based approach for accounting, to encompass all human activities in <lb/>the land sector that result in GHG emissions or removals. This could potentially be more <lb/>transparently embedded within GHG inventories and a clear mapping provided of how the <lb/>coverage of the activity-based approach relates to that of the land-based approach.<lb/>An IPCC expert meeting revisited the managed land proxy in May 2009, and concluded at that time that <lb/>continued use of the managed land proxy remained the only practicable method available (IPCC, 2009). <lb/>Nevertheless, the expert meeting also agreed that the managed land proxy &quot; could in the future include an <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>increasing proportion of natural and indirect human contributions [and therefore] work needs to continue to <lb/>identify and test approaches to separating anthropogenic impacts from others &quot; . This topic could be visited <lb/>again in the 2016-2020 period to take stock of scientific advances in this area and to reconsider whether the <lb/>managed land proxy remains the most effective method available. <lb/>Use of market mechanisms <lb/>Some Parties may wish to use market mechanisms as a tool to finance and/or incentivise mitigation actions <lb/>in the land sector in the post-2020 period. Further, inclusion of the land sector could also help to create <lb/>deeper and more liquid carbon markets, given the significant abatement potential that exists in this sector. <lb/>The scope and nature of market mechanisms under the UNFCCC in the post-2020 period remains unclear. <lb/>There are currently three parallel streams in the UNFCCC negotiations which could be relevant: (i) the <lb/>new market mechanism, (ii) the framework for various approaches, and (iii) non-market approaches. <lb/>Discussions of all three topics are currently taking place under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and <lb/>Technological Advice (SBSTA). Parties have agreed that these various mechanisms under the UNFCCC <lb/>are to stimulate mitigation across &quot; broad segments of the economy &quot; (UNFCCC, 2012). This is likely to <lb/>include the land sector, particularly in developing countries. <lb/>Confidence in the environmental integrity of tradable GHG units from the land sector could be enhanced <lb/>by robust technical reviews of baselines and reference levels, as under the REDD+ mechanism. Up-front <lb/>information would also be needed on the approach used to deal with non-permanence and the impact of <lb/>natural disturbances. While high standards of environmental integrity would be expected for GHG units <lb/>originating from the land sector, setting the bar for participation too high (e.g. by requiring Tier 3 IPCC <lb/>methodologies for the relevant sources or sinks) would make it challenging for many Parties to participate <lb/>and would risk decreasing the total level of mitigation achieved from this sector. Any guidance or <lb/>development of standards could draw on experience to date under the UNFCCC as well as from voluntary <lb/>carbon markets. <lb/>5. Conclusions <lb/>How emissions and removals from the land sector are reported and accounted for in the post-2020 period <lb/>will have a significant influence on the effectiveness of the 2015 agreement. This is because CO 2 , CH 4 and <lb/>N 2 O emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use are the second largest source of anthropogenic <lb/>GHG emissions after the energy sector (IPCC, 2014a). In particular, non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture <lb/>are rising rapidly and are now a greater GHG contributor than deforestation (Christ, 2014). Moreover, <lb/>there is significant emissions abatement potential in the global land sector. This abatement potential is <lb/>enhanced by the fact that, in some cases, forestry and other land use can act as a net sink of CO 2 . <lb/>The LULUCF part of the land sector has several features that make it different to other sectors. These <lb/>include strong legacy effects due to forest structure, and risk of natural disturbances causing reversals of <lb/>carbon removals by land sinks. Further, both agriculture and LULUCF can have multiple competing policy <lb/>objectives and relatively high uncertainty associated with estimates of emissions and removals. A cost-<lb/>effective reporting and accounting framework is needed that respects these important differences, while <lb/>enabling governments to gain recognition for nationally determined mitigation actions undertaken in the <lb/>land sector. <lb/>Accounting in the context of the UNFCCC is more than simply a book-keeping exercise. The accounting <lb/>framework can provide incentives to pursue some actions and not others. An accounting framework is <lb/>needed that incentivises governments to undertake as much mitigation in the land sector as possible, while <lb/>meeting other policy objectives such as adaptation, preservation of biodiversity, food security and poverty <lb/>alleviation. <lb/></body>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>Several reporting and accounting frameworks for the land sector currently exist. These include reporting of <lb/>anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals under the Convention, reporting and accounting for <lb/>agriculture and LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol, reporting and accounting for afforestation <lb/>and reforestation projects under the CDM, and reporting on REDD+. There is no internationally-agreed <lb/>accounting framework for the mitigation targets and actions put forward for 2020 under the Cancun <lb/>Agreements, or for the intended nationally determined contributions put forward for the post-2020 period. <lb/>In many cases how the land sector component of these targets and actions will be accounted for remains <lb/>unclear. <lb/>In some areas there are overlaps between existing reporting and accounting systems in terms of coverage. <lb/>For example, afforestation and reforestation activities are covered by the LULUCF, CDM and REDD+ <lb/>arrangements under the Kyoto Protocol. In other areas there are differences; for example, CH 4 and N 2 O <lb/>emissions from agriculture are included in the reporting and accounting framework for Annex B Parties, <lb/>but no internationally-agreed accounting framework for agriculture (or any other sector) currently exists <lb/>for non-KP Annex I Parties or developing countries. In future, convergence between these various work <lb/>streams could lead to a simpler and more comprehensive land sector reporting and accounting system. <lb/>A long-term vision for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting is laid out in this paper, building on <lb/>recent studies on land sector accounting and the 2015 agreement. The vision is of a land sector reporting <lb/>and accounting framework that is applicable to all countries, taking into account their national <lb/>circumstances. The framework would encourage countries to take on increasing responsibility for <lb/>emissions and removals in the land sector over time as cost-effectively as possible. It would create <lb/>incentives to move towards greater coverage of key sources, both in terms of reporting and accounting, and <lb/>would not penalise countries for their initial starting points. Some developing countries would need <lb/>capacity building to improve the quality and accuracy of their GHG reporting and accounting systems. <lb/>The coverage of the future land sector reporting and accounting framework should include as many key <lb/>sources and sinks as possible. This would help to avoid &quot; cherry-picking &quot; of mitigation activities, provide <lb/>incentives to take a holistic approach to mitigation in the land sector and help to ensure that the reporting <lb/>and accounting framework reflects only anthropogenic impacts on sources and sinks. It will take time to <lb/>achieve a broad reporting and accounting framework. Therefore Parties could gradually increase coverage <lb/>over time on a &quot; once in, always in &quot; basis. <lb/>At present there is not an internationally-agreed approach for setting baselines or reference levels for the <lb/>land sector in the post-2020 period. Therefore a high level of up-front transparency is needed to ensure <lb/>clarity and understanding of the intended nationally determined contributions proposed. Up-front <lb/>information on the assumptions and calculations used to construct baselines or reference levels, coupled <lb/>with technical expert review of the reference levels as under the existing Kyoto Protocol and REDD+ <lb/>mechanisms, could help to achieve this. <lb/>Near-term steps could be taken at COP 20 and beyond to put Parties on a pathway towards achieving the <lb/>long-term vision outlined in this draft paper. At COP 20 in Lima, Parties could agree to create a work <lb/>stream under the ADP to discuss land sector accounting issues and decide on the up-front information to be <lb/>provided alongside intended nationally determined contributions in the land sector, including information <lb/>on the assumptions underlying reference levels. At COP 21 in Paris, Parties could agree to lay out a set of <lb/>foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting as part of the 2015 agreement. Possible <lb/>elements for such foundations could include agreement that: <lb/>• All Parties are to use IPCC 2006 Guidelines for reporting (with different Parties using different <lb/>tiers for different sources and sinks, according to capacity)<lb/></body>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>• The coverage of land sector accounting in terms of gases and lands should be expanded over <lb/>time, using the &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule, with a view to achieving broad coverage of key sources <lb/>of GHG emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and other land uses. <lb/> • Option to use reference levels and/or intensity metrics to track progress towards mitigation <lb/>contributions relating to agriculture, forestry and soils, with a view to providing cost-effective <lb/>accounting options that take into account national circumstances. <lb/> • Technical assessments cycles are to be undertaken for intended baselines or reference levels, <lb/>building on existing technical review processes under the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+. <lb/> • Qualitative information is to be provided on environmental and social safeguards ( and efforts to <lb/>pursue holistic landscape-based approaches such as ecosystem-based adaptation and climate-<lb/>smart agriculture, to complement the quantitative accounting framework. <lb/> • Flexibility in some aspects of the reporting and accounting framework and acceptance of <lb/>different entry points for different countries, to accommodate the different national circumstances <lb/>and capacities of countries. <lb/> • Enhanced capacity building is needed in developing countries to improve reporting and <lb/>accounting capacity.<lb/>Once the basic foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting have been established, work <lb/>could be undertaken on the more technical details in the period 2016-2020. Further issues to be addressed <lb/>in this period could include guidance for reference levels, how to deal with reversals caused by natural <lb/>disturbances or indirect human effects, how to separate anthropogenic from natural emissions and <lb/>removals, the role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms, and consideration of how <lb/>multiple objectives can be accommodated in mitigation accounting (e.g. consideration of alternative <lb/>approaches to agriculture accounting that are compatible with food production objectives). <lb/></body>
