			<head>1. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Most contemporary assessments of the economic effects of transportation infrastructure<lb/> investments fall into two major categories, one at the micro-scale and the other at the macro-scale. Micro-<lb/>scale assessments follow the procedures of cost-benefit analysis (CBA). They use information on the<lb/> likely outcomes of a proposed project – its effect on travel times, traffic flows, emissions, accidents, etc. –<lb/> to estimate a pecuniary value of its lifetime benefit. That benefit estimate is then contrasted with lifetime<lb/> project costs to determine whether it is economically productive. Such ex ante analyses are often required<lb/> as a justification for devoting public funds to a proposed project. (For a review see <ref type="biblio">Mackie and Nellthorp,<lb/> 2001.)<lb/></ref> Macro-scale studies include econometric analyses that relate the aggregate investment in (or stock<lb/> of) transportation infrastructure to economy-wide measures of economic performance. For the most part,<lb/> they specify production or cost functions in which public infrastructure is regarded as an input to<lb/> production by private firms in a region or nation. The estimated production and cost functions provide<lb/> evidence of the contribution that infrastructure investment makes towards augmenting the productivity of<lb/> private firms and, in some cases, make it possible to calculate a rate of return on aggregate infrastructure<lb/> investment. (For a review see <ref type="biblio">Lakshmanan and Anderson, 2002.)<lb/></ref> The two approaches are complementary. Micro-scale analyses have the advantage of being able<lb/> to measure the impacts of adding or improving a specific infrastructure element, but the scope of their<lb/> economic assessment is limited to effects on users of the element in question or closely related elements<lb/> and to firms and individuals in its immediate locale. The macro-scale analyses capture a broader range of<lb/> economic impacts, but they treat infrastructure investment as a homogenous good (measured in dollars or<lb/> network miles.) and are therefore of little use for assessing the worth of specific investments. Further, the<lb/> macro-scale approach sheds little, if any, light on the mechanisms that drive the observed economic<lb/> impacts.<lb/></p>

			<p>To provide a more complete picture of the economic impacts of infrastruture, an intermediate<lb/> level of analysis is needed. For convenience, we refer to this level as &quot; meso-scale, &quot; although models in<lb/> this category might be applied at a variety of geographical scales. We define three requisites for models<lb/> in this class.<lb/> 1. Unlike macro-scale analyses they should incorporate information about specific additions or<lb/> improvements to transportation infrastructure networks (although not necessarily at the level of detail<lb/> found in micro-scale analyses.)<lb/> 2. They should trace the economic processes that are triggered by infrastructure improvements. (As we<lb/> will explain below, these may take the form of static general equilibrium effects or dynamic<lb/> developmental effects.)<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Finally, in order to assess the relative magnitude of different economic mechanisms and to inform<lb/> policy, they should be amenable to empirical implementation using data that are either available or<lb/> obtainable at reasonable cost.<lb/> As a contribution toward the development of meso-scale analyses, we introduce a computable<lb/> general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates a number of novel mechanisms for tracing the effects<lb/> of additions to the capacity of a transport network through the broader economy. Infrastructure<lb/> investments are modeled as reducing travel times over links in a network. The key novelty is to<lb/> incorporate travel time explicitly in the utility and profit maximization problems of households and firms.<lb/> For households, travel time for commuting and consumption activities enters a time budget that also<lb/> includes time devoted to work and leisure. For firms providing transportation services, travel time affects<lb/> the number of trips that can be provided by a given stock of vehicles, which in turn affects the prices of<lb/> intermediate and final goods.<lb/> The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 discuss the broad economic<lb/> impacts of transportation infrastructure and the state of the art in assessing those impacts. Section 4<lb/> reviews the relatively brief literature on assessing economic impacts of infrastructure investment with a<lb/> CGE framework. Section 5 constitutes the meat of the paper, presenting an overview of our model, a<lb/> complete algebraic specification, details of implementation and a discussion of data needs. Section 6<lb/> provides a discussion and summary.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. CONTEXT: THE BROADER ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE<lb/> INVESTMENT<lb/></head>

			<p>The role of transportation infrastructure in the economy is multifaceted and plays out over a long period<lb/> of time. It is unlikely that any modeling framework can capture all possible mechanisms. For our purpose,<lb/> it is useful to make a distinction between two classes of economic impacts, which we call static general<lb/> equilibrium impacts and dynamic developmental impacts. Static general equilibrium impacts comprise a<lb/> broad range of effects coursing through the economy consequent on the time and monetary savings<lb/> induced by the infrastructure improvements. Such temporal and monetary savings alter, in turn, the<lb/> marginal costs of transport producers, individuals&apos; mobility and the demand for goods and services in the<lb/> context of lowered congestion. As these changes ripple through the market mechanisms, endogenous<lb/> changes occur in employment, output, and incomes. Dynamic developmental impacts ensue from the<lb/> mechanisms set in motion when transport infrastructure improvements activate a variety of interacting<lb/> processes that yield over time many sectoral, spatial, and regional effects which augment productivity.<lb/></p>

			<p>They produce transformations in the structure and pattern of the economy – such as changes in the spatial<lb/> pattern of production; creation of new industries and inter-industry linkages; changes in the lifestyles and<lb/> preferences of households; and the evolution of institutions and markets. While static general equilibrium<lb/> impacts arise from the actions of a well-defined set of economic agents through the medium of markets,<lb/> dynamic developmental impacts involve complex interactions of economic, social, cultural and<lb/> institutional factors and are more idiosyncratic in nature. We therefore attempt to capture only the former<lb/> category of impacts in the CGE model.<lb/></p>

			<p>General equilibrium effects occur within a system of market relationships that is stable and<lb/> relatively well understood. Most economic activities require some movement of goods and people.<lb/> Production requires the movement of intermediate inputs to the production site, the movement of workers<lb/> back and forth between their homes and places of employment (commuting) and the movement of<lb/> finished goods to market. Consumption activities also require movement as in the case of household trips<lb/> for shopping and recreation. To the extent that improvements to transportation infrastructure reduce the<lb/> cost of movement of goods and people, they affect the levels of economic activity in all parts of the<lb/> economy.<lb/> A number of general equilibrium mechanisms are described in detail below. But for the purpose<lb/> of illustration, consider the effect of infrastructure on employment. Most transportation analyses start with<lb/> the explicit or implicit assumption that the number of people who commute to work over a given network<lb/> is fixed. In an economy like the US, however, labor supply is by no means perfectly inelastic because<lb/> significant segments of the population, such as mothers with children and individuals past the normal<lb/> retirement age, face decisions as to whether to enter or remain in the labor force. Labor supply is normally<lb/> associated with the wage, but since commuting represents a significant cost of labor force participation,<lb/> infrastructure improvements could entice more people to work. Of course, in a general equilibrium<lb/> framework this would represent a shift in the labor supply function, which in turn would affect the<lb/> equilibrium wage and employment level.<lb/></p>

			<p>A peculiar aspect of transportation infrastructure investments is that the cost reductions they<lb/> generate are often realized in time savings rather than monetary savings. Returning to the commuting<lb/> example, a road expansion that relieves congestion might have a minor effect on a commuter&apos;s out of<lb/> pocket cost (e.g. lower fuel costs due to efficiency improvements that stem from changes in the driving<lb/> cycle) but a major effect on commuting time. Time is a scarce resource for any potential worker, so less<lb/> time spent commuting means more time is available for work, leisure, consumption activities, childcare,<lb/> etc. Thus, in assessing the general equilibrium impacts of transportation infrastructure, the household time<lb/> budget is as important as the household expenditure budget. Depending on the magnitude of the wage<lb/> relative to the marginal utility of leisure, the impact of the decrease in commuters&apos; time costs on the labor<lb/> supply may be larger than that of their pecuniary savings.<lb/> A general equilibrium perspective on transportation infrastructure recognizes that reductions in<lb/> the pecuniary and time costs of transportation can lead to increases in the levels of various economic<lb/> activities and thereby to increased derived demand for transportation services. Thus, induced traffic flows<lb/> are a natural outcome of market mechanisms. To many transportation analyses, such flows are seen as<lb/> negating benefits from transportation infrastructure. A project whose congestion reduction effect<lb/> disappears due to increased traffic within a few years of its implementation is seen as a failure. This point<lb/> of view may be appropriate from an environmental perspective, where the goal of the project is to reduce<lb/> emissions via improved traffic flow, but there are conceptual difficulties from a broad economic<lb/> perspective. Induced trips are derived from increases in economic activities (labor supply, production,<lb/> consumption, recreation) that lead to increased welfare, so as long as there are more trips there is<lb/> presumably a benefit. This has an important implication: from a broader economic perspective, the<lb/> benefits of a transportation infrastructure project cannot be assessed solely in terms of resultant travel<lb/> time savings. This is especially true over the medium to long run, when the additional economic activity<lb/> made possible by the expansion of infrastructure capital stock increases the derived demand for<lb/> transportation to the point where it once again approaches the transportation network&apos;s capacity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The fact that we do not try to capture dynamic developmental impacts in the CGE model is not<lb/> meant to detract from their importance. Impacts of this type are most pronounced in low-income<lb/> countries, where infrastructure improvements often represent significant and non-marginal enhancements<lb/> of infrastructure capacity, which (along with the transport services they make possible) can facilitate<lb/> interregional trade and integration. As infrastructure and service improvements lower money and time<lb/> costs and increase accessibility to various market actors—input suppliers, workers and customers—<lb/> market expansion, increased interregional integration and sustaining growth occurs over time. The<lb/> underlying mechanisms include gains from trade, technology shifts, and gains from agglomeration<lb/> supported by transport. A well-studied example of such developmental transformation is the experience of<lb/> the U. S. Midwest consequent on a 400% expansion of the rail network between 1848 and 1860 –<lb/> essentially linking the Midwest to Northeastern U. S. and the world economy. There is considerable<lb/> evidence that the development of railroads accelerated the settlement, agricultural expansion, and growth<lb/> and diversification of manufacturing, and initiated dynamic sequences that integrated the New England<lb/> and Mid-Atlantic regions with the Midwest (<ref type="biblio">Fogel, 1964, Fishlow 1965</ref>, Lakshmanan and Anderson<lb/> 2007). A more recent example of such developmental effects of major road investments is discernable in<lb/> Sri Lanka (Gunasekara, Anderson and Lakshmanan 2007 forthcoming). The broader literature on<lb/> transport and economic development suggests that transport infrastructure facilitates the transformation of<lb/> low-income economies from subsistence to commercial agriculture, the development of basic, transport-<lb/>intensive industries and the growth of cites (Haynes and Button, 2001).<lb/> It would be a mistake to think that developmental impacts occur only at an early stage of<lb/> economic development. Even in a mature economy, transportation infrastructure improvements might<lb/> promote structural changes such as increased decentralization or agglomeration of economic activity;<lb/> changes in the way business enterprises conduct operations such as inventory management, logistics and<lb/> other practices; enhanced opportunities for face-to-face interaction; and a range of new recreational<lb/> opportunities (Anderson and Lakshmanan, 2007.) These impacts, which affect the long-term evolution of<lb/> the economy, are difficult to measure and even more difficult to predict. Nevertheless they are important,<lb/> and a better understanding of developmental effects should lead to better decision-making on<lb/> transportation infrastructure.<lb/></table>

			<head>3. CONVENTIONAL METHODS OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT<lb/></head>

			<p>As we have stated earlier, current methods of impact assessment include the micro-scale CBA<lb/> and macro-scale econometric studies. CBA is nearly universal as a means of assessing the desirability of<lb/> specific projects. Conceptually, economic benefits are assessed as the consumer surplus, defined in<lb/> relation to the demand curve for the infrastructure facility in question. The effect of the infrastructure<lb/> improvement is represented as a rightward shift in the infrastructure supply curve, which results in a fall<lb/> in the price of using the facility—usually defined in units of time as opposed to money—for any given<lb/> level of demand. The associated economic benefit thus has two components: one based on the cost<lb/> savings enjoyed by the number of travelers who used the facility prior to the improvement, and a second<lb/> representing the benefits to new travelers who now choose to use the facility because of its lower price.<lb/> Since the benefit is calculated in terms of time savings, it is necessary to apply a value of time to<lb/> recast the total benefit in monetary terms so that it can be compared against the project&apos;s cost. Benefits<lb/> may also be adjusted for the value of environmental externalities and traffic accidents. Since benefits<lb/> accrue annually over the lifetime of the facility and most costs are incurred at the beginning of its<lb/> lifetime, present values of the flows of benefits and costs are calculated to make them comparable.<lb/> In practice, the result of CBA can be highly sensitive to the assumed value of time and discount<lb/> rates. If these values are accurate, however, the beauty of CBA lies in the theoretical argument that<lb/> consumer surplus, which is a measure of travelers willingness-to-pay, captures the full range of economic<lb/> benefits.1 For example, other measurable benefits, such as property appreciation near the improved<lb/> facility, are chiefly outcomes of reduced travel time so including them in benefit calculation constitutes<lb/> double-counting (<ref type="biblio">Forkenbrock and Foster, 1990</ref>).<lb/> Even proponents of CBA concede that there are broader economic impacts that are not captured,<lb/> but argue that the magnitude of these impacts for any particular project is probably small (<ref type="biblio">Mackie and<lb/> Nellthorp, 2001</ref>). But such impacts summed across a number projects may be substantial, which suggests<lb/> that CBA is more appropriate for assessing individual projects than for assessing a program of<lb/> infrastructure spending. As an indication that certain broader impacts are excluded from CBA results,<lb/> notice that economic benefits are measured almost exclusively in terms of time savings. As we noted<lb/> earlier, general equilibrium benefits can accrue even in the absence of time savings.<lb/></p>

			<p>To the extent that an infrastructure spending program significantly influences relative prices, its<lb/> effects are likely to be felt in markets that are removed from those under the narrow consideration of<lb/> micro-level CBA. (e.g., consider the impacts on West-coast commodity markets of a significant<lb/> infrastructure investment at the Port of Long Beach.) In such cases, analysis which (i) ignores changes in<lb/> prices by treating the latter as strictly exogenous and (ii) considers only those impacts which are spatially<lb/> or temporally proximate—or confined to transportation or related sectors—may well fail to fully account<lb/> for the benefits of the investment in question. In traditional CBA the issue boils down to the conditions<lb/> under which the value of time is a theoretically valid measure of for the monetary impacts of these myriad<lb/> inter-market adjustments, and the extent to which these conditions are likely to be satisfied in practice.<lb/> Macro-scale assessments of the economic impact of productivity analysis generally take the form<lb/> of production and cost functions in which transportation infrastructure is included as an argument on the<lb/> right-hand-side. (For a review see Lakshmanan and Anderson, 2002.) Despite their rigorous grounding in<lb/> economic theory, there is a &quot; black-box &quot; quality about them because public capital does not function like<lb/> private capital in the production technology. For example, no firm has exclusive use of a highway, and for<lb/> any firm one might consider, there are large segments of the highway network that it does not use at all.<lb/> Still, a firm might benefit from a highway that it does not use directly via the indirect means of reduced<lb/> input costs. Clearly the mechanisms by which private productivity is enhanced by transportation<lb/> infrastructure are varied and complex. Thus, a positive output elasticity tells us that some economic<lb/> benefit is occurring, but sheds little light on the underlying mechanisms (<ref type="biblio">Anderson and Lakshmanan,<lb/> 2007</ref>). In particular, it is often very difficult to discern how much of the observed impact is due to<lb/> developmental as opposed to general equilibrium influences.<lb/> A further limitation of macro-level studies is that they treat transportation infrastructure as a<lb/> homogeneous good that can be measured in dollar terms. Such a measurement has some validity in the<lb/> case of private capital, because it is not unreasonable to assume that the value of a capital good reflects its<lb/> competitively determined marginal revenue product. In the case of transportation infrastructure, which is<lb/> allocated via mechanisms that are likely to emphasize distributional goals or political expediency over<lb/> economic efficiency, such an assumption is questionable. It is highly likely that investments of some<lb/> types and in some locations are more productive than others.<lb/></p>

			<p>In short, the results of macro-studies point to an important relationship between public capital and<lb/> private productivity, but provide little in the way of either explanation or policy guidance.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. A REVIEW OF GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSES OF CONGESTION<lb/></head>

			<p>We focus our attention on two sets of simulation studies, which develop models of the interplay<lb/> between infrastructure and congestion at the level of the aggregate economy. The first, by <ref type="biblio">Mayeres and<lb/> Proost (1997)</ref>, Conrad, 1997 and Conrad and Heng (2000), define an explicit index of congestion (Z),<lb/> modeled a function of the level of utilization of aggregate transportation infrastructure or capacity, where<lb/> the latter is expressed in terms of either aggregate transport activity or the size of the vehicle capital stock.<lb/></p>

			<p>Congestion incurs a productivity penalty on firms and a utility penalty on consumers. The former<lb/> manifests itself through the reduced speed with which firms are able to ship their goods to market, while<lb/> the latter does do via the diminished quality of transport services consumed by households. The second<lb/> set of studies (<ref type="biblio">Parry and Bento, 2001</ref>; 2002) model congestion through the device of an explicit<lb/> household time budget. Increases in travel times with the expansion of transport activity cause a reduction<lb/> in labor supply and the consumption of both leisure and services of transport producers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Mayeres and Proost (1997) construct a stylized applied general equilibrium model which captures<lb/> the essence of the congestion problem without simulating the process by which infrastructure spending<lb/> affects the value of time. They consider a simple economy made up of a utility-maximizing representative<lb/></figure>

			<p>household and two representative firms, summarized algebraically as follows:<lb/></p>

				<formula>, , ,<lb/> max ( , ;<lb/> )<lb/> P<lb/> P<lb/> C<lb/> q R<lb/> U C<lb/> Z q<lb/> ξ<lb/> −<lb/> Λ<lb/> Λ<lb/> (MP1)<lb/> subject to:<lb/> 1<lb/> 1<lb/> , )<lb/> (<lb/> P<lb/> F<lb/> C q<lb/> R Z f h q<lb/> ϖ<lb/> −<lb/> + + ≤<lb/> (MP2)<lb/> q F = f 2 (h 2 )<lb/> (MP3)<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> h h<lb/> H<lb/> +<lb/> Λ≤<lb/> +<lb/> (MP4)<lb/> 1.5<lb/> 1/[1 (<lb/> ) /(<lb/> )]<lb/> P<lb/> F<lb/> Z<lb/> q<lb/> q<lb/> C A P R<lb/> =<lb/> −<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> (MP5)<lb/></formula>

			<p>In eq. (MP1) the household derives utility (U) from consumption of a final good (C), passenger<lb/> transport (q P ) and leisure (Λ). Eq. (MP2) says that firm 1 combines inputs of labor (h 1 ) and freight<lb/> transportation (q F ) according to the production function f 1 to produce the final good, which may be<lb/> consumed directly, allocated to passenger transport services, or used to create new transport infrastructure<lb/> (R). Firm 2 produces freight transportation services from labor (h 2 ) according to the production function f 2<lb/> in (MP3), and the household&apos;s labor endowment (H) constrains labor-leisure choice in (MP4): Eq. (MP5)<lb/> specifies how the imbalance between aggregate transport activity and infrastructure capacity (CAP) gives<lb/> rise to congestion according to a capacity restraint function based on Evans (1992). In turn, Z adversely<lb/> influences both the productivity of the final goods producer and the quality of passenger transport enjoyed<lb/> by the household, according to the elasticities ξ and ϖ, respectively. Infrastructure investment alleviates<lb/> congestion by expanding transit capacity, though at the cost of reduced consumption.<lb/></p>

			<p>Conrad (1997) and Conrad and Heng (2002) apply these ideas in the context of a large-scale<lb/> recursive-dynamic CGE model (GEM-E3). They elaborate the mechanisms underlying eq. (MP5) by<lb/> developing an explicit model of the influence of aggregate infrastructure on the utilization of vehicle<lb/> capital stocks. Their economy is made up of a representative utility-maximizing household and j = {1, ...,<lb/> J, Tr} firms, where firm Tr is a producer of transportation services. Firms&apos; capital stocks are partitioned<lb/> into intersectorally mobile &quot; jelly &quot; capital (k j ) and transportation capital (kt j ), which represents vehicles<lb/> and is a fixed factor. In the simplest version of their model the aggregate quantity of transportation<lb/> infrastructure (KI) is constant, and its divergence from the socially optimal level (KI*) is responsible for<lb/> congestion which reduces the productivity of kt:<lb/></p>

			<p>In (CH1) the household derives utility from consumption of C j units of each good, with<lb/> congestion diminishing the quality of consumed transportation services. The j th firm produces a unique<lb/> good which is both consumed and used as an intermediate input (X i, j ) to the i other firms (CH2).<lb/> Production is described by a nested CES function, f j , which combines intermediate inputs with labor (h j ),<lb/> jelly capital (k j ) and effective units of transportation capital ( ). The latter consists of a benchmark<lb/> quantity of fixed capital ( ) whose productivity is exponentially augmented by infrastructure in (CH4)<lb/></p>

			<p>and attenuated by congestion in (CH3). These influences are modulated by the coefficient a and the<lb/> elasticity ϖ, respectively, and the factor exp(–a / KI) &lt; 1 can be interpreted as a capacity utilization<lb/> measure. Equilibrium between the demands for labor, capital and infrastructure and the endowments of<lb/> these factors (H, K and KI) is given by eqs. (CH6)-(CH8), and eq. (CH5) defines congestion in terms of<lb/> the weighted average utilization rate of transportation capital relative to the optimal utilization level, with<lb/> industry weights ω j . <ref type="biblio">Conrad (1997)</ref> derives the condition for the optimum (CH9) under the assumption<lb/> that there exists an exogenous government-cum-social planner whose objective is to minimize the<lb/> economy&apos;s total expenditure on transportation. The resulting supply function for KI* is denominated over<lb/> the quantities of firms&apos; transportation capital stocks, their shadow prices (<lb/></p>

				<formula>e<lb/> j<lb/> kt<lb/></formula>

			<p>This approach has the advantage of being straightforward to numerically parameterize. 2<lb/> However, its main limitation is that it does not explicitly relate congestion to investment in infrastructure<lb/> and the value of time (e.g., the Lagrange multiplier on eq. (MP4)), whose role in CBA is to indicate when<lb/> the marginal benefits of alleviating the former exceed the marginal costs of the latter. The relevant<lb/> mechanism is captured by the second set of studies, which model the production of travel as requiring<lb/> inputs of time, which explicitly enter into a household time budget constraint.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Parry and Bento (2001)</ref> emphasize the impact of substitution among differentially congested<lb/> modes of travel on time expenditures. Theirs is a stylized model of commuting—production is modeled in<lb/> the simplest possible way and freight transport is not considered. The economy is made up of a utility-<lb/>maximizing household, a final goods producer and three transport firms (indicated by the subscript m),<lb/> each of which corresponds to a particular mode: congested roads (R), public transit (P) and non-congested<lb/></p>

			<p>The household derives utility from consumption of the final good and leisure, (PB1). Eq. (PB2)<lb/></p>

			<p>says that the output of the final goods firm is produced from labor and aggregate transportation services<lb/></p>

			<p>(Q) according to a fixed-coefficients technology, and can either be consumed or allocated to intermediate<lb/> uses by the transport firms (X m ). Transport services are defined in (PB3) as a composite of the trips on the<lb/> different modes (q m ), with f used to indicate a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator<lb/> function. In turn, the production of trips in eq. (PB4) necessitates use of the intermediate commodities and<lb/> travel time (T m ). For public transit and uncongested roads, trip generation is modeled using a Leontief<lb/> transformation function, whose coefficients (ν m and τ m ) indicate the per-trip expenditures of money and<lb/> time. The implication is that for these modes the level of congestion is exogenous, with constant marginal<lb/> time expenditures τ m . By contrast, on congested roads the level of congestion is endogenous. The<lb/> modeling device used to represent this is the CES aggregator function D, which defines the degree of<lb/> substitutability between travel time and &quot; available road capacity &quot; , given by the linear function</p>

				<formula>d 1 – d 2 q R<lb/></formula>

			<p>(where d 1 and d 2 are constants). Finally, the time budget constraint (PB5) requires that the sum of labor<lb/> supply, leisure and total commuting time exhaust the household&apos;s time endowment ( T ).<lb/></p>

			<figure>The simple logic of the model is that production creates a derived demand for transport. As trips<lb/> via congested modes (in this case roads, R) rise, so does congestion, which in turn reduces available<lb/> capacity and time spent traveling by those modes, inducing substitution of trips to less congested<lb/> alternatives. The critical parameters governing this process are the elasticities of substitution among<lb/> transit modes in f and between travel time and unused mode capacity in D, and the coefficients of the road<lb/> availability function.<lb/> Parry and Bento&apos;s (2002) extension enumerates trips on congested freeways (RF) and alternate<lb/> back roads (RB) as additional modes of travel, includes negative externalities such as accidents and air<lb/> pollution (which we indicate using the function E), and represents congestion in terms of travel time using<lb/> a more traditional approach</figure>

			<p>Here, however, (PB2′) assumes that each unit of labor produces one unit of the final good, which can be<lb/> consumed or used to pay for trips, whose transformation into aggregate transport services follows (PB3).<lb/></p>

			<figure>As in (PB4), trips incur fixed marginal pecuniary costs (PB6), but marginal expenditures of time (PB7)<lb/> which increase with congestion. Eq. (PB10) defines the latter relationship using the classic Bureau of<lb/> Public Roads (BPR) capacity restraint formula.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In both Parry-Bento models, the Lagrange multiplier on eq. (PB5) represents the &quot; true &quot; marginal<lb/> utility of time, which takes into account the general equilibrium interactions among the labor supply, the<lb/> consumption of the final good and leisure, and the supply-demand balance for trips by different modes.<lb/> Nevertheless, the value of time which emerges from this analysis still does not completely account for the<lb/> channels through which congestion&apos;s effects are felt. In particular, the simple representation of production<lb/> fails to capture the way in which travel delays impact firms or may themselves be exacerbated by the<lb/> shipment of finished goods to retail markets or households&apos; retail purchasing behavior.<lb/> Likewise, the specification of substitution possibilities in transportation is simplistic. The Parry-<lb/>Bento models are &quot; maquettes &quot; which resolve only a few, very aggregate modes of travel and can afford to<lb/> rely on synthetic benchmark distributions of trips. 3 In section 5.2.5 we caution that moving to the use of<lb/> real-world data to numerically calibrate the aggregator functions for transportation services may be quite<lb/> involved. The remainder of the paper addresses these issues and examines their implications for<lb/> constructing large-scale transport-focused CGE models.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. A HYBRID MESO-MACRO APPROACH<lb/></head>

			<p>Our proposed approach is a hybrid one which seeks to capture meso-level details of<lb/> infrastructure, congestion and transport within the traditional framework of a macro-level CGE model.<lb/></p>

			<p>We consider a static economy with N representative profit-maximizing firms, each of which produces a<lb/> single, distinct commodity. Firms and commodities come in two varieties, I non-transport producers and<lb/> their associated goods and services, which we index using the subscript i = {1, ..., I}, and M transport or<lb/> logistics firms and their associated services, which we index with the subscript m = {1, ..., M}. To<lb/> distinguish between firms and the goods which they produce, we introduce the subscript j = {1, ..., I} to<lb/> enumerate non-transport producers. Furthermore, we define the set of transport producers in such a way<lb/> that each firm corresponds to a single disaggregate mode of transit, e.g., rail as well as truck freight<lb/> shippers, air passenger and freight travel, own-supplied passenger road travel using private vehicles,<lb/> purchased local/interurban passenger transit by road and rail, etc. Non-transport firms supply goods and<lb/> services to satisfy the intermediate demands of other firms as well as the final demands of households.<lb/></p>

			<p>Transportation firms provide freight transport services to the non-transport firms and passenger transport<lb/> services to households. Households in the economy are modeled as a representative utility-maximizing<lb/> agent who owns the factors of production (hours of labor, H, and capital, K) and rents them out to the<lb/> firms in exchange for factor payments which finance the consumption of commodities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The centerpiece of our approach is a representation of the process though which the operation of<lb/> markets for non-transport commodities and labor creates derived demands for transportation. In<lb/> particular, we assume that:<lb/></p>

			<p>(a) Each unit of non-transport commodity requires freight trips to be shipped to sources of intermediate<lb/> or final demand.<lb/></p>

			<p>(b) The representative agent&apos;s final purchases of these goods and services require retail shopping trips in<lb/> order for them to be converted into utility, and<lb/></p>

			<p>(c) The agent&apos;s rental of labor to firms requires commuting trips.<lb/></p>

			<p>The three kinds of mobility are distinguished using the superscripts TF, TC and TH, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>We assume that households face two budget constraints, a pecuniary constraint that commodity<lb/> purchases not exceed factor income, and a temporal constraint that the duration of travel for shopping and<lb/> commuting, hours of work and leisure not exceed an aggregate endowment of time. The latter sets up a<lb/> tension between travel time expenditures for the purposes of consumption and income generation. For<lb/> households to increase their consumption they need more income, which in the short run can only be<lb/> obtained by renting additional hours of labor to firms, with the possible side-effect of more and/or longer<lb/> journeys to work. However, their ability to earn is constrained by the fact that consuming more non-<lb/>transport goods requires additional retail trips, and concomitant expenditures of time.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firms do not have explicit time budgets, nevertheless we assume that time constraints influence<lb/> production in an implicit fashion. We treat non-transport firms as &quot; mills &quot; , whose products are<lb/> manufactured using labor, capital and intermediate inputs from other non-transport firms. In order for<lb/> these products to be consumed they must be shipped to markets, which creates a demand for trips<lb/> supplied by the transportation firms. A key feature of the model is that the latter firms do not produce<lb/> trips directly. Rather, their outputs take the form of generalized transportation services such as vehicles<lb/> operated on the road, trains on tracks, planes in the air, etc.—whose capacity is determined by the firms&apos;<lb/> stocks of transportation capital (i.e., vehicles). This allows us to model the mechanism by which<lb/> congestion imposes a productivity penalty on firms: speed, which along any given segment of the<lb/> transportation network is equivalent to the inverse of the travel time, is necessary to transform these<lb/> services into trips. Thus, given a certain capacity to produce transport services, increases in travel time<lb/> translate into fewer trips. Other things equal, the main consequence is a fall in the productivity of inputs<lb/> to transportation and in rise in the average cost of trips, a decline in movements of passengers and non-<lb/>transport goods, and a reduction in production and consumption.<lb/></p>

			<p>These devices allow us to model the impacts of congestion in a novel way. Congestion is the<lb/> increase in travel time arising out of the imbalance between the aggregate derived demand for mobility<lb/> and the capacity of the stock of transportation infrastructure to support the desired flux of trips. Our way<lb/> of representing travel admits three channels through which congestion may exert a drag on activity,<lb/> corresponding to (a)-(c), above:<lb/></p>

			<p>• An increase in the duration of households&apos; retail trips per unit of consumption, which attenuates<lb/> consumption through the time budget constraint. Depending on the relevant elasticities, the time spent<lb/> on work or leisure may rise or fall as well, but the standard result is a decline in utility.<lb/></p>

			<figure>• A reduction in average productivity of transport-producers. Because congestion increases the duration<lb/> of freight trips of a given distance, it reduces the number of trips which transport producers can<lb/> supply with a given fleet of vehicles. The consequent dissipation of operating time—and thus<lb/> revenue—drives a wedge between the marginal cost of each transportation firm&apos;s output and the unit<lb/> value of its trips consumed by firms and households, much like a tax.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Dissipation of time in commuting, acting through the time budget constraint to reduce the economy&apos;s<lb/> aggregate labor supply. This effect is similar to a tax on labor.<lb/></p>

			<p>To effectively inform traditional microeconomic cost benefit analysis, any attempt to capture<lb/> these influences using top-down economy-wide models must address a number of issues. First,<lb/> considering the impacts of congestion in the aggregate will yield limited insights, as typically only a<lb/> fraction of the links in an economy&apos;s transport network will be congested. These are the ones which are<lb/> candidates for infrastructure projects. Following from this observation, a second consideration is that trips<lb/> should be thought of as differentiated commodities, whose equilibrium allocation among network links<lb/> will be a function of transport producers&apos; marginal costs, firms and households&apos; demands for goods and<lb/> passenger mobility, and the distribution of travel times/congestion. In general, infrastructure investments<lb/> that are sufficiently large will give rise to simultaneous non-marginal changes in all of these variables, the<lb/> character of which will depend on both magnitude of the investments and their location on the network.<lb/> Finally, in order to properly capture the dissipative effect of congestion, a distinction needs to be made<lb/> between the production of transport services and the consumption of the trips which they make possible.<lb/></p>

			<p>Logistics and passenger transport firms will allocate their outputs to the network segments which yield<lb/> the highest marginal revenue, while households and non-transport firms will allocate their demand for<lb/> trips to links with the lowest marginal cost. The key challenge is therefore to develop a computationally<lb/> tractable way of modeling the equilibrium between the supply-side transformation of transport services to<lb/> trips and the demand-side aggregation of trips into passenger and freight movements so as to resolve the<lb/> substitution of trips from congested links to uncongested alternatives.<lb/></p>

			<p>The simplest way of doing this is to keep the spatial details of the network structure to a<lb/> minimum. Our strategy is to assume the existence of a generic transport network with l = {1, ..., L} links,<lb/> amongst which trips generated by the m transport producers are allocated in a competitive fashion. This<lb/> choice allows us to specify a top-down model of intermediate complexity which is able to capture the<lb/> macroeconomic feedbacks which affect—and are affected by—Wardropian equilibria, while serving as a<lb/> bridge to more disaggregate network equilibrium models (e.g., <ref type="biblio">Ferris et al, 1999</ref>). We make the key<lb/> simplifying assumption that trips across different mode-link alternatives are imperfect substitutes, with<lb/> differing marginal costs to transport consumers and differing marginal revenues to transport producers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus, when non-transport firms ship their product to market, or households supply labor or consume a<lb/> particular commodity, each of these actors simultaneously chooses travel distances/routes and modes by<lb/> allocating trips over l and m so as to minimize total transportation expenditure. Symmetrically, each<lb/> logistics or passenger transport firm simultaneously chooses travel distances/routes and payloads by<lb/> allocating the transportation services it produces to trips by l and j in the case of freight, l and i in the case<lb/> of retail shopping, and just l in the case of commuting, so as to maximize revenue.<lb/></p>

			<p>We operationalize these ideas by specifying transportation demands as constant elasticity of<lb/></p>

			<table>substitution (CES) functions of trips by mode. Thus, freight transport demand by the j th firm,<lb/> , is<lb/> TF<lb/> j<lb/> Q<lb/> modeled as a CES aggregate of the trips,<lb/> , made by transport mode m on network link l to ship j&apos;s<lb/> product to intermediate and final consumers. Similarly, we model the aggregate household demand for<lb/> transportation to consume the i th commodity,<lb/> , as a CES function of the retail trips,<lb/> , across all<lb/> combinations of transit modes and links, and the aggregate demand for transportation to supply labor,<lb/> Q TH , as a CES function of the various mode-and link-specific commuting trips,<lb/> . We use the same<lb/> device on the supply side, specifying the trips undertaken by each transport producer as a constant<lb/> elasticity of transformation (CET) expansion of that firm&apos;s output. Thus, firm m&apos;s trips<lb/> ,<lb/> and<lb/> are modeled as a CET function of the aggregate supply of transportation services by mode, Y m . Parry<lb/> and Bento (2001) note that the ability to substitute between transport modes mitigates the cost of reducing<lb/> congestion. Our assumption that households and firms substitute among both transport modes and<lb/> network segments means that the elasticities in the aforementioned CES and CET functions will likely be<lb/> a key influence on the marginal benefit of investments to increase the capacity of congested links.<lb/> , ,<lb/></table>

			<p>The attractive feature of this formulation is that it automatically generates different levels of<lb/> congestion for each transport mode and network link. Congestion is a function of the total flux of trips<lb/> generated by each mode across a given link,<lb/></p>

			<p>in which 0<lb/> ,<lb/> l m<lb/> τ is the mode-and link-specific free-flow travel time.<lb/> The dependence of capacity on infrastructure investment is an exogenous input to the model that<lb/> must be developed from the existing characteristics of the transit network, the links which are candidates<lb/> for improvement, and the projected changes in traffic flows resulting from the proposed project. Eqs.</p>

				<formula>(1)<lb/></formula>

			<p>and</p>

			<p>(2) establish the crucial connection between household trips to consume goods or commute back and<lb/> forth to work, and the trips undertaken by logistics firms to deliver commodities. Growth in any one type<lb/> of transportation adds to the total flux of trips across the transport network, raising trip times, and<lb/> inducing economic actors to re-allocate trips to less congested mode-link alternatives, as well as cut back<lb/> on overall travel. As mentioned above, the consequence of this is a decline in both the quantity of labor<lb/> supplied to producers and the goods and services consumed by households. In this way infrastructure<lb/> capacity acts as a fundamental brake on the expansion of economic activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.<lb/> Algebraic Summary of the CGE model<lb/></head>

			<p>We begin with a description of the households in our simulated economy. We assume the<lb/> existence of a representative agent whose utility is represented by the nested CES function shown in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>. At the top level of the nesting hierarchy, the agent obtains utility (U) from non-transport<lb/> consumer commodities ( ) and leisure (Λ), with elasticity of substitution σ U and technical coefficients<lb/></p>

			<p>The second level of the utility hierarchy describes how the demands for commodities create derived<lb/> demands for personal transportation. We specify each unit of delivered commodity as a CES composite of<lb/> transportation services,<lb/> (i.e., trips for the purpose of retail purchases), and the relevant commodity<lb/> ( ) whose consumption necessitates transport expenditures, with elasticity of substitution<lb/></p>

				<formula>TC<lb/> i<lb/> Q<lb/> i<lb/> C 񮽙<lb/> C<lb/> i<lb/> σ &lt; 1 and<lb/> technical coefficients TC<lb/> i<lb/> β and C<lb/> i<lb/> β :<lb/> ( )<lb/> ( )<lb/> (<lb/> /(<lb/> 1)<lb/> (<lb/> 1 )/<lb/> (<lb/> 1 )/<lb/> ˆ<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> TC<lb/> TC<lb/> C<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> C<lb/> Q<lb/> C<lb/> σ<lb/> σ<lb/> σ<lb/> σ<lb/> σ<lb/> σ<lb/> β<lb/> β<lb/> )<lb/> −<lb/> −<lb/> −<lb/> =<lb/> +<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> .<lb/> (4)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Each retail commodity is itself a composite of the goods and services actually being purchased by<lb/> consumers and freight transportation services, which we discuss in more detail below. Note that eq. (4)<lb/></p>

			<p>σ &lt; 1) the actual quantity<lb/> of travel undertaken by households is discretionary. Consequently, our formulation captures the ability of<lb/> consumers to substitute passenger travel (<lb/> ) for the freight transportation component of , e.g., by<lb/> opting to travel to retail outlets to purchase goods versus having them delivered directly to the consumer&apos;s<lb/> place of residence. At the lowest level of the hierarchy the transportation services necessary to consume<lb/> good i are a CES composite of the shopping trips (<lb/></p>

			<p>Households&apos; rental of their factor endowments is modeled in a similar fashion. We assume that<lb/> transport services are not necessary to supply capital to firms. However, to supply H units of labor the<lb/> agent must utilize transportation services, Q TH (i.e., trips for the purpose of commuting).

			<figure>(17)<lb/> In an appendix to the paper we provide a detailed mathematical elaboration of how the foregoing<lb/> elements may be used to construct an operational CGE model. The assumption of Walrasian competitive<lb/> equilibrium allows us to express the production and aggregation relations in eqs. (3)-(7) and (10)-(14) in<lb/> terms of their dual cost functions and associated conditional input demand functions. The latter can then<lb/> be substituted into the supply-demand balance constraints (6), (8), (9) and (15)-(17) to yield a system of<lb/> nonlinear equations (Ξ) in commodity and factor prices, the activity levels of firms and the income level<lb/> of the representative agent. The result is the Walrasian excess demand correspondence of the economy.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The advantage of our approach is two-fold. First, on the consumer side, the price variable<lb/> consisting of the Lagrange multiplier on eq. (9) is the endogenous value of time, which takes full account<lb/> of not only the channels through which congestion&apos;s impacts manifest themselves, but also the general<lb/> equilibrium interactions among these effects. Second, in both eq. (9) and the cost functions for transport<lb/> producers (i.e., the dual of eq. <ref type="biblio">(14)</ref>) congestion plays the role of a vector of differentiated, link-specific<lb/> taxes on trips. This is very useful, as it enables us to simulate congestion as an endogenous, nonlinear tax<lb/> whose level is determined by trip volumes according to eqs.</p>

			<head>5.2.<lb/> Data and Calibration<lb/></head>

			<p>Numerical solution of the model requires that values be specified for the parameters of the excess<lb/> demand correspondence, Ξ. This procedure, known as calibration, is likely to be especially challenging<lb/> given that it requires the integration of economic and transportation data which are often incommensurate.<lb/></p>

			<p>Calibrating the purely macroeconomic, non-transport related components of the CGE model is a<lb/> fairly simple task, involving the selection of values for the elasticities σ U ,<lb/> and<lb/> based on empirical<lb/> estimates, and the computation of values for the coefficients α i , α Λ , δ NT and δ T using a national-or<lb/> regional-level social accounting matrix (SAM). (For details see, e.g., Sue Wing, 2004.) We anticipate that<lb/> it will be somewhat more difficult to find econometric estimates for, or calibrate using related empirical<lb/> studies, values for the substitution elasticities<lb/> , or to infer values for the coefficients<lb/></p>

			<p>from data on freight transport margins. And since published estimates for the elasticities<lb/> ,<lb/> ,<lb/> ,<lb/> do not exist, developing the data and econometric procedures to estimate these parameters will likely<lb/> involve a large amount of effort. A rough-and-ready way to proceed is to set up the model using the<lb/> values in the range assumed by <ref type="biblio">Parry and Bento (2001, 2002</ref>), and perform sensitivity analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>in the trip aggregation and<lb/> transformation functions is likely to be a significant undertaking. The key difficulty lies in defining the<lb/> topology of the transport network and associated traffic flows at a geographic scale for which there are<lb/> published inter-industry economic accounts. Although survey data on commuting and freight traffic flows<lb/> are readily available at the level of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), input-output data are rarely<lb/> tabulated at such a fine spatial scale. At the opposite extreme, while it is straightforward to construct an<lb/> aggregate CGE model using a SAM constructed from the transportation satellite account make and use<lb/> tables (<ref type="biblio">Fang et al, 2000</ref>), for modes of surface travel such as commuting or retail shopping which are<lb/> important contributors to congestion, it is not obvious how to represent major congested network links at<lb/> such a highly aggregate scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus, apart from the normative question of what is the most appropriate geographic scale at<lb/> which our model should be specified, data constraints dictate the practical necessity of structuring a<lb/> reduced-form representation of the transportation network so that it is both sufficiently simple to calibrate<lb/> the γ and μ parameters and able to be matched to a regional SAM. At the current stage of this research,<lb/> the most promising source of economic data would seem to be county-level SAMs developed by<lb/> IMPLAN which are coterminous with MSAs that straddle major transportation corridors in the eastern<lb/> U.S.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>Provision of transportation infrastructure is one of the most visible, vital and costly ways in which<lb/> the public sector contributes to the private economy. Yet decisions about the levels and allocations of<lb/> transportation infrastructure investments must currently be made with incomplete information about their<lb/> economic impacts. Analytical tools are limited to micro-scale analyses, which may not capture the full<lb/> range of economic benefits induced by a project or program, and macro-scale analyses, which are too<lb/> broadly defined to provide guidance on the relative benefits of specific projects and programs. The<lb/> situation calls for analytical tools defined as a &quot; meso-level &quot; that can provide impacts assessments that are<lb/> both comprehensive and capable of representing specific expansions of infrastructure capacity, following<lb/> the three criteria we define in the introduction. This paper contributes to the development of such tools by<lb/> specifying a CGE model that is specifically designed to assess the broader economic impacts of<lb/> transportation infrastructure investments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The model specified above draws on the limited CGE literature on transportation<lb/> infrastructure – especially the household time budgets of Parry and <ref type="biblio">Bento (2001, 2002</ref>). It goes beyond<lb/> existing models both in terms of its technical specification and its overall scope. It specifies a set of<lb/> derived demands for transportation services that arise from production, consumption and labor supply<lb/> activities. It represents transportation infrastructure as a set of capacitated mode-link combinations on<lb/> which flows are assigned and congestion is modeled as increases in travel time. By embedding travel time<lb/> explicitly in the determination of household utilities and the prices and quantities of commodities<lb/> produced in the economy, it incorporates in the model the phenomenon of congestion that is based on a<lb/> comprehensive, endogenous definition of the value of time.<lb/> Existing CGE models designed for the analysis of transportation infrastructure can, for the most<lb/> part, be classified s maquettes – that is, simplified or scaled down models designed to make rough<lb/> estimates of relative magnitudes or as steps toward the creation of more comprehensive models. By<lb/> contrast, the model specified above is intended as a practical tool for policy analysis. There are, however,<lb/> significant hurdles to overcome before it can be made operational, including defining an appropriate<lb/> geographical scale for its application, an appropriate level of detail for the set of mode-link combinations<lb/> and appropriate data and parameters for calibration.<lb/> The question that naturally arises is whether it is worth the effort. To some extent this comes<lb/> down to the empirical question of whether the broader economic benefits captured in the CGE model are<lb/> of significant magnitude relative to the more direct effects captured in CBA. But looking beyond the<lb/> &quot; bottom line &quot; of aggregate benefits, the CGE model generates a range of information that cannot be<lb/> obtained from existing models such as whether the benefits of a capacity expansion accrue mostly to<lb/> firms or households, whether household benefits are mostly in consumption activities or commuting and<lb/> whether some industries benefit more than others. Such information may be useful in assessing whether<lb/> specific objectives that policy makers attach to a project are likely to be met. Also, the CGE specification<lb/> is especially well-suited to assessing the impact of infrastructure programs because the implementation of<lb/> two or more capacity expansions can be modeled simultaneously. This will be useful in identifying<lb/> complementarities among projects by seeing, for example, whether the benefits of projects A and B<lb/> implemented simultaneously exceed the sum of the benefits of A and B implemented independently.<lb/> Ultimately, the value of a model such as the one we have specified lies in its laying bare a<lb/> plausible set of economy-wide interactions that are triggered by an improvement in transportation<lb/> infrastructure. In other words, it is an attempt to move beyond &quot; black box &quot; and &quot; bottom line &quot; approaches<lb/> to policy models to an approach that explains rather than just captures economic impacts. Naturally,<lb/> laying the underlying mechanisms bare opens the door to criticism based on underlying assumptions –<lb/> especially as regards market imperfections. Furthermore, we recognize that there are a range of dynamic,<lb/> developmental impacts that the model does not include. Still, we believe that specifying and calibrating<lb/> our model is a useful step toward a better understanding of the economy-wide consequences of<lb/> transportation infrastructure in the economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>7. APPENDIX: IMPLEMENTATIONAL DETAILS<lb/></head>

			<p>Walrasian general equilibrium prevails when the price of commodities equals their marginal cost<lb/> of production with firms earning zero profits, there is zero excess demand for commodities and factors,<lb/> and consumer&apos; income equals their expenditure. These conditions form the basis for CGE models in a<lb/> complementarity format, which specify the economy as a vector of zero profit, market clearance, income<lb/> balance, and auxiliary equations. Each equation is paired with an associated dual variable with respect to<lb/> which it exhibits complementary slackness (see, e.g., <ref type="biblio">Rutherford, 1995; Sue Wing, 2004</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Zero profit conditions for firms and households. These specify the equilibrium between commodity<lb/></head>

			<p>prices and firms&apos; unit cost functions, and between the marginal utility of income and the aggregate<lb/> expenditure function. They complementary to the activity levels of firms and the utility level of the<lb/> representative agent.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Market clearance conditions for commodities and factors. These specify</head>

			<p>the equilibrium between the<lb/> aggregate demands for commodities and factors—which are functions of prices and activity levels,<lb/> and their aggregate supplies—typically indicated by firms&apos; activity levels and households&apos; factor<lb/> endowments. They are complementary to commodity and factor prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Income balance conditions. These specify the equilibrium between the value of households&apos;<lb/></head>

			<p>expenditures and the value of their income, and are complementary to the income levels of the<lb/> households.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Auxiliary equations.</head>

			<p>These typically represent some sort of constraint on the economy that is a<lb/> function of both an auxiliary variable and other endogenous variables, which requires them to be<lb/> solved for along with the remaining variables. They are complementary to the auxiliary variable..<lb/></p>

			<p>Henceforth we use the shorthand symbol &quot; ⊥ &quot; to represent these complementary relationships.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.1.<lb/> Zero Profit Conditions and Associated Demand Functions<lb/></head>

			<p>As before, we begin with the households in the economy. Recasting the representative agent&apos;s<lb/> utility maximization problem as a dual expenditure minimization permits us to solve for the unit<lb/> expenditure function, ε, dual to (3):<lb/></p>

			<p>This expression can be thought of as a zero-profit condition for the &quot; production &quot; of a utility good, to<lb/> which aggregate utility is the complementary activity variable.

			<p>Turning now to the firms in the economy, cost minimization by producers of non-transportation<lb/> goods and services in eq. (10) results in the following zero-profit condition:<lb/></p>

			<p>where P j is the producer price of each non-transport commodity and r is the capital rental rate. The zero-<lb/>profit condition for logistics firms in eq. (13) takes a somewhat different form, owing to the CET<lb/> specification of production. In particular, transportation services are not traded, and so do not have an<lb/> explicit price within the model. Producers therefore equate the marginal revenue from revenue-<lb/>maximizing allocation of trips in (14) to the marginal cost from cost-minimizing transport service<lb/> production in (13):<lb/></p>

			<p>The left-hand side of the foregoing expression clearly demonstrates that the impact of congestion is<lb/> identical to a tax on trips that is differentiated by link.
