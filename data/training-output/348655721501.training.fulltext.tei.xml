			<p>Meeting international commitments to development co-operation such as the Millennium<lb/> Development Goals, the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development and the Gleneagles<lb/> G8 summit agreements to increase aid by around $50 billion per year by 2010 will require not<lb/> only increased resources, but also their judicious use. In this context policy makers and others<lb/> cannot limit their attention to the effectiveness of foreign aid alone; they must broaden the<lb/> discussion to include the development-related impacts of a spectrum of rich-country policies,<lb/> including those related to investment, trade and international migration. Such policies can work<lb/> at cross purposes on the ground in developing countries, thwarting poverty reduction and<lb/> hindering economic growth. Yet in most cases the policy impacts have been studied separately or<lb/> independently. The OECD Development Centre&apos;s Policy Coherence activities address this<lb/> knowledge gap by conducting well defined country case studies of the interaction of<lb/> rich-country policies in poor countries (including their interdependence with local policies), in<lb/> close collaboration with researchers and institutions in developing countries. To further that end,<lb/> the Centre has asked leading experts to take stock of what is known about the impact of four key<lb/> vectors of OECD member policies — those governing official development assistance (ODA),<lb/> foreign direct investment (FDI), migration and trade — on development in poor and emerging<lb/> economies. These four background papers, all of which will shortly be available publicly,<lb/> provide a key input into the Centre&apos;s Policy Coherence project. This paper is one of them.<lb/> OECD member policies do sometimes work at cross purposes in their development<lb/> impact. For example, restrictions on developing-country exports under the recently terminated<lb/> Multifibre Agreement (MFA) cost those exporters an estimated $50 billion annually, very<lb/> roughly equal to annual foreign-aid flows to developing countries during the same period.<lb/> Clearly this shows incoherence between trade and aid policies insofar as one objective of policy<lb/> making is to promote economic development. The growing number of African doctors in some<lb/> OECD members suggests another example. It reveals incoherence between foreign-aid policies,<lb/> which seek to increase the supply of health services in poor countries and in many cases pay to<lb/> train doctors, and migration policies, which selectively seek out doctors and provide powerful<lb/> incentives for them to leave their home countries. Of course, OECD member trade and migration<lb/> policies have objectives other than promoting development in poorer countries, and citizens and<lb/> policy makers may decide that in some cases those other objectives are more important than<lb/> development. Yet at the very least, this project seeks to make more explicit the magnitude of the<lb/> trade-offs among policies. What, in short, is the cost of policy incoherence?<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to identifying cases where rich-country policies work at cross purposes, a<lb/> cross-cutting issue is whether policies are complements or substitutes. Policies to promote ODA and<lb/> FDI, for example, are complementary if aid flows to a country (to finance port infrastructure, say)<lb/> increase the attractiveness of that country as a destination for capital flows. Policies are substitutes if<lb/> the effects of diminished flows from one policy can be offset by increased flows from a second. Many<lb/> observers wonder whether the considerable remittance flows sent home by migrants might substitute<lb/> for foreign aid flows, reducing poverty and financing investment. Of course, the complementarity of<lb/> FDI and ODA or the substitutability of remittances and aid are at this point merely hypotheses. The<lb/> project aims to study such interactions more carefully; this paper provides one input.<lb/></p>

			<head>SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper provides a theoretical and empirical overview of the relationships among<lb/> trade, aid and FDI, both in terms of policy interactions and interactions among resource flows.<lb/> Aid flows from one country to another can have positive or negative effects on trade flows<lb/> between those countries. These effects, in turn, may act at two different levels. There are<lb/> macro-level links between aid and trade: aid enhances saving, permitting more imports, or aid<lb/> raises the real exchange rate, depressing exports. There are also micro-level mechanisms: tied aid<lb/> may increase exports if it is spent on enhancing trade capacity, but other forms of tied aid merely<lb/> lead to allocative inefficiency. Aid flows can affect trade policy in the developing country that<lb/> receives them, whether via the Dutch disease effect on the terms of trade, or via the explicit tying<lb/> of aid to the purchase of donor country goods. Aid flows also interact with donor-country trade<lb/> policy; perhaps the starkest way to frame this question is to ask whether a given developing<lb/> country is made better off by aid spending or access to the donor country&apos;s market. Economic<lb/> thinking has generally posited that a dollar of aid provides the same welfare to a poor country as<lb/> a substantially larger sum of export earnings ($2.29 according to one widely-cited study).<lb/> Nevertheless, under certain conditions that may well prevail in many countries, access to the<lb/> donor country&apos;s market may provide greater development potential; this depends in part on the<lb/> relative magnitude of negative consequences of aid inflows (via the exchange rate) and positive<lb/> dynamic effects of export specialisation. Empirical research on these issues is frustrating in its<lb/> lack of consensus, which may arise in part from difficult problems of establishing causality,<lb/> i.e., does trade affect aid, does aid affect trade, or do they mutually affect each other?<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper next tackles the question of interrelations among trade flows and policies and<lb/> FDI flows and policies. While the theoretical literature suggests that trade and FDI may be<lb/> complements or substitutes, in practice there are compelling a priori reasons to suspect that trade<lb/> and FDI flows are complements. New trade theory models furthermore suggest that<lb/> liberalisation of trade and FDI policies in developing countries are not substitutes and that they<lb/> have complicated interactions: for example, FDI liberalisation by itself might encourage<lb/> &quot; horizontal &quot; or market-seeking FDI, while co-ordinated FDI/trade liberalisation might be more<lb/> likely to encourage &quot; vertical &quot; or cost-reducing FDI.<lb/></p>

			<head>I. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper provides a theoretical and empirical overview of the interactions among aid<lb/> policies, foreign direct investment (FDI) policies, trade policies and trade flows, looking at<lb/> outcomes from the point of view of the recipient or host developing country. <ref type="figure">Figure 1<lb/></ref> summarises and illustrates the types of links discussed. Starting with the interactions between<lb/> aid and trade, linkage may relate aid and trade flows (A1). It can also go from aid policy to trade<lb/> flow (A2). A third possibility is an aid policy intended to influence trade policy in the<lb/> recipient/host country (A3), and an inherent question of clash or coherence connects donors&apos; aid<lb/> and trade policies (A4). Interactions also appear between FDI and trade (F1, F2, and F3). Based<lb/> on these various linkages, researchers can assess the joint impact of aid, trade and FDI policies on<lb/> the welfare of the recipient/host country.<lb/></p>

			<p>From a policy point of view one would like to understand whether aid and FDI policy<lb/> instruments (denoted as A and FDI below) act as complements to or substitutes for trade policy<lb/> instruments (denoted as T) with respect to a welfare policy objective (W) in the recipient/host<lb/> economy. This target W can be a static or dynamic long-run aggregate welfare indicator like<lb/> national real income or growth, or it can relate to the degree of heterogeneity inside the recipient<lb/> country (poverty, inequality or distributive concerns). In mathematical terms, one seeks ideally<lb/> information on the sign of the cross derivative:<lb/></p>

				<formula>A<lb/> T<lb/> W<lb/> ∂<lb/> ∂<lb/> ∂<lb/> 2<lb/> or<lb/> FDI<lb/> T<lb/> W<lb/> ∂<lb/> ∂<lb/> ∂<lb/> 2<lb/></formula>

			<p>The arrows in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> indicate the typical channels through which such<lb/> complementarities or substitutions can occur. Policy instruments affect economic flows, in turn<lb/> generating interactions between aid or FDI flows and trade flows. These interactions then should<lb/> influence the welfare objective. Policies can also link directly when they involve conditionality or<lb/> additionality. The empirical literature has often focused more on the relationships between flows<lb/> than on those between policies, because flows are more easily measured.<lb/> Two important policy dimensions need acknowledgement. The first concerns the<lb/> definition and analytical content of trade, FDI or aid policies. In practice, each will likely be a<lb/> finely grained, multi-dimensional vector of instruments. For instance, trade policy may contain<lb/> features like tariffs and trade taxes, quantitative restrictions, rules of origin, protective<lb/> administrative procedures (antidumping, countervailing duties, customs delays), trade<lb/> restraints, or various domestic discriminatory policies (subsidies, barriers to entry, standards and<lb/> regulations). Similarly, FDI policy may involve various types of subsidy, tax exemption schemes,<lb/> factor-content arrangements and investment regulations, while aid policy typically includes an<lb/> array of bilateral and multilateral instruments including conditional and tied aid, targeted and<lb/> general funds, safety nets, etc. Most of the literature generally takes an aggregate view of these<lb/> policy vectors, but it is important to keep in mind that each will find implementation through the<lb/> interplay of its several instruments. The conclusion of this paper will return more precisely to<lb/> this issue.<lb/> Second, all of these policy areas have important political-economy dimensions. Typically,<lb/> policy implementation generates gainers and losers within and across countries, in most cases<lb/> without appropriate compensation. These distributive impacts in turn stimulate rent-seeking and<lb/> rent-sharing responses among groups or coalitions of agents. Clearly, these aspects are crucial for<lb/> understanding the internal and external political constraints within which policy coherence or<lb/> incoherence can occur. The conclusion returns briefly to this point, but most of the paper<lb/> abstracts from it and therefore neither formally models the political decision-making process nor<lb/> exhaustively reviews the related political-economy literature.<lb/></p>

			<head>II. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AID POLICY AND TRADE<lb/> II.1 Conceptual Aspects<lb/> The Relationship between Aid Flows and Trade Flows<lb/></head>

			<p>A first approach is to consider the possible causal relationships between aid flows and<lb/> trade flows (A1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Aid may affect trade because it induces general economic effects in<lb/> the recipient country, because it is directly tied to trade and/or because it reinforces bilateral<lb/> economic and political links. The first plausible impact goes through the traditional<lb/> macroeconomic view that aid supplements domestic saving, leading to increased investment that<lb/> contributes to higher growth than would be possible without aid (<ref type="biblio">White, 1992</ref>). The induced<lb/> growth implies a greater capacity of the recipient country to absorb foreign products including<lb/> those originating from donors. Along this line, aid flows will likely in the medium run generate<lb/> more international trade flows for the recipient country. In a related mechanism, aid often carries<lb/> conditions for structural economic reforms in the recipient country. When the targeted reform is<lb/> trade liberalisation, the effect of aid on trade is direct, but it could also be indirect as long as<lb/> reforms stimulate growth, which in turn may increase the import capacity of the recipient<lb/> economy. Note, however, that this line of reasoning also provides good arguments for a negative<lb/> rather than positive aid/trade relationship. Aid may in fact have only a negligible<lb/> macroeconomic effect due to fungibility (<ref type="biblio">Heller, 1975</ref>). Even if all aid is saved and invested, it<lb/> may simply crowd out other domestic investment by increasing the price of investment goods. A<lb/> similar result may apply if aid is tied to counterpart funds. To raise these funds, the recipient<lb/> government may have to levy distortionary taxes and/or issue public debt, which can increase<lb/> interest rates and crowd out private investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid Dependency<lb/></head>

			<p>In the same macroeconomic tradition, the most celebrated argument of a relationship<lb/> between aid and trade flows is probably that involving the so-called &quot; Dutch disease &quot; and &quot; aid<lb/> dependency &quot; effects in the recipient economy. It illustrates the potential conflict between aid<lb/> flows and export competitiveness. The story is quite well known. Aid flows will go to finance<lb/> expenditures on non-tradable goods and services. With the price of tradable goods given, a<lb/> relative price shift in favour of non-tradable sectors (a real appreciation of the exchange rate) can<lb/> occur. The immediate effect occurs on the demand side, where more of the cheaper tradables<lb/> (especially imports) will be demanded, leading to a deterioration of the external balance that in<lb/> turn will require more aid flows (the aid dependency effect). At the same time, the real<lb/> appreciation of the exchange rate leads to a resource transfer from the tradable to the non-<lb/>tradable sector, causing a significant squeeze on export producers (the Dutch disease). The<lb/> impact of aid on trade flows of the recipient country therefore occurs in two steps. First, imports<lb/> tend to increase in the short run, while in the medium run domestic export capacity tends to<lb/> decrease. If there is an inter-temporal effect (like a learning externality effect of exports on<lb/> domestic productivity), the Dutch disease may have long-run negative implications for the trade<lb/> flows of the recipient country. If the country has idle capacity, however, the income effect of aid<lb/> might not translate into real appreciation as both the tradable and non-tradable sectors might<lb/> grow. Moreover, a developing country might even benefit from a real appreciation because of<lb/> low substitutability between domestic production and imported inputs (<ref type="biblio">Nkusu, 2004</ref>). Yet if idle<lb/> capacity originates from rigidity on the production side, such as price or wage indexation, it is<lb/> not obvious that the tradable sector would gain in all cases from an aid transfer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid Tying<lb/></head>

			<p>Formal tying of aid to the recipient&apos;s purchase of goods from the donor provides the most<lb/> direct and obvious link between aid and trade. Because such aid generally takes the form of<lb/> goods procured by the donor, aid is itself trade in the form of donor exports. Tied aid may also<lb/> induce dynamic effects by increasing recipient exposure to donor export goods, which in turn<lb/> may encourage follow-up orders and expand future donor exports. Such aid is an instrument of<lb/> trade policy (<ref type="biblio">Morrissey, 1991</ref>). Tying can also be informal, the result of political goodwill such<lb/> that the recipient may feel more inclined, if not obliged, to buy the donor&apos;s goods. Again, tying<lb/> may generate important allocative inefficiencies inside the recipient economy. <ref type="biblio">Jepma (1991)</ref>,<lb/> notes that exports under tied aid often exceed prevailing world prices by between 10 per cent<lb/> and 40 per cent. Capital-goods imports priced so highly may retard growth and therefore the<lb/> subsequent capacity of the country to trade with the rest of the world. Tied aid thus may have<lb/> differential temporal impacts on trade flows, increasing them in the short run and reducing them<lb/> in the long run.<lb/> Aid-induced trade dependency can also occur. Even when aid is not tied, for example, it<lb/> may fund projects requiring imports of capital goods produced only in the source country. Food<lb/> aid, it has been argued, tends by reducing local prices to distort the allocation of resources in<lb/> recipient countries away from local food production. Over time, this can exacerbate and prolong<lb/> the very shortages that the aid is intended to solve, with the outcome of prolonged dependence<lb/> on trade flows from donor countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reverse Causality<lb/></head>

			<p>As several authors have recognised (see the survey in <ref type="biblio">Lloyd et al., 1998</ref>), the causality<lb/> between aid and trade flows obviously can also go the other way around. This paper focuses on<lb/> the causality link from aid to trade, but it is useful to remember the main arguments for reverse<lb/> causality. Trade can affect aid allocation in different ways. Lobby and business groups, which<lb/> may have particular trade interests, can influence aid allocation in donor countries, or donors can<lb/> simply give aid-allocation preferences to countries with which they have the strongest<lb/> commercial ties. A donor might want to reward a recipient for the purchase of its export goods,<lb/> or it might want to consolidate or expand its markets where the expectations of aid-induced<lb/> trade dependency are highest. Conversely, the causal relationship can reverse if the donor uses<lb/> aid to promote export ties in countries with which it has weaker commercial links.<lb/></p>

			<head>How Do Aid Flows Interact with Trade Policy in the Recipient Country?<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the plausible channels of interaction between aid and trade flows, what about the<lb/> direct interactions between policy instruments? The route from aid instruments to aid flows<lb/> seems quite direct and needs little discussion. The interplay between aid flows/policies and trade<lb/> policies of the recipient or donor country (A3, A4 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) is more complex. This subsection<lb/> reviews what theory has to say about foreign aid and trade policies in recipient countries and<lb/> their consequences for the recipients&apos; welfare as measured by aggregate national real income.<lb/> The next subsection investigates the links between aid and donor trade policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Transfer Paradox<lb/></head>

			<p>The conceptual background stems from the theory of income transfers in international<lb/> trade theory. How a transfer of real resources from one country to another affects both the source<lb/> and recipient countries has now become part of a well-established tradition in international<lb/> economics, well known since the Keynes-Ohlin controversy on German reparation payments<lb/> after World War I and Samuelson&apos;s clarification (1952). Beyond its direct income effect, an<lb/> international transfer will likely have important terms-of-trade effects on both the donor and the<lb/> recipient, the sign of which depends on the relative size of the marginal propensities to consume<lb/> in the two economies. The so-called &quot; orthodox &quot; view holds that the donor&apos;s terms of trade<lb/> should deteriorate because each country should have a larger domestic marginal propensity to<lb/> consume its exportable good (<ref type="biblio">Keynes, 1929</ref>). Subsequent, significant work has considered the<lb/> &quot; anti-orthodox &quot; view that an income transfer improves the donor&apos;s terms of trade (see <ref type="biblio">Jones,<lb/> 1970; Chipman, 1974; Jones, 1975; and Li and Mayer, 1990</ref>).<lb/> A major issue involves how income transfers affect the welfare levels of the donor and<lb/> recipient countries. The literature has given considerable attention to the conditions under which<lb/> an international transfer is immiserising for the recipient country (the &quot; transfer paradox &quot; ). As is<lb/> well known from Leontief (1936), Samuelson (1947) and Mundell (1960), in a two-country world<lb/> with free trade and no distortions, immiserising transfers from abroad cannot arise when<lb/> markets are stable<lb/> 1<lb/> . In the interactions between aid instruments and trade policies, however,<lb/> transfers that worsen welfare in the recipient country become possible when one departs from<lb/> the distortion-free world 2 . First, consider a multilateral world economy and enlarge the set of<lb/> countries to more than the two economies participating in the transfer. Several contributions<lb/> have shown the possibility of perverse transfer outcomes in a three countries/agents context<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Gale, 1974; Chichilnsiky, 1980; Brecher and Bhagwati, 1981; and Yano, 1983</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Bhagwati et al.<lb/></ref> 1.<lb/> Stability means that in global markets an excess demand for a particular good leads to an increase in the price of<lb/> this good in order to restore the initial competitive equilibrium.<lb/> 2.<lb/> For more details, see the survey in <ref type="biblio">Brakmann and Marrewijk (1998).<lb/> (1983)</ref>, however, demonstrate in their integrating analysis with a theory of distortions and<lb/> welfare that the transfer paradox cannot arise in a three-agent framework if the recipient and the<lb/> donor countries uniformly impose an optimal tariff policy jointly against the non participant<lb/> country. This result suggests a certain degree of complementarity between foreign aid and<lb/> regional trade policies crafted to avoid perverse welfare outcomes in a recipient economy.<lb/> Second, the transfer may take place in the presence of exogenous domestic distortions, of<lb/> which trade policies in the recipient or the donor countries represent an important case. As<lb/> Ohyama (1974), Brecher and Bhagwati (1982) and more generally <ref type="biblio">Bhagwati et al. (1985)</ref> show,<lb/> exogenous price distortions such as tax and/or subsidy policies, can lead to the transfer paradox<lb/> and a recipient-country loss from the aid transfer. This is quite easy to grasp intuitively in the<lb/> case of a recipient&apos;s tariff policy, for example. Recall that an immiserising transfer occurs<lb/> basically because, after the transfer, the recipient faces deterioration in its terms of trade. This<lb/> leads to increased production and reduced consumption of the recipient&apos;s importable. Under<lb/> domestic tariff protection, however, this commodity already is &quot; over produced &quot; and &quot; under<lb/> consumed &quot; . The change in relative international prices therefore exacerbates this existing<lb/> situation, and the extra cost may suffice to ensure a welfare decline in the aid-receiving country 3 .<lb/> When this occurs, the preceding discussion suggests that trade liberalisation by the recipient can<lb/> act as a complement to the foreign aid instrument. Indeed, a reduction of the recipient&apos;s tariff<lb/> must accompany the transfer from abroad in order to minimise the possibility of a transfer<lb/> paradox in the recipient country 4 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Probably the most interesting situation arises when the transfer itself creates domestic<lb/> distortions. Aid tying is of course the classical example. <ref type="biblio">Ohyama (1974)</ref>, Brecher and <ref type="biblio">Bhagwati<lb/> (1982)</ref>, Kemp and Kojima (1985), Schweinberger (1990) and Tajoli (1999) all are welfare analyses<lb/> of the general phenomenon. For instance, Brecher and Bhagwati (1982) consider a small open<lb/> economy where aid is accompanied by &quot; production additionality requirements &quot; — e.g. food aid<lb/> whose donor may require more domestic food production as a condition for the aid. In such a<lb/> case, production shifts away from its efficient allocation, and the recipient may end up poorer<lb/> after the transfer. When the donor demands that local imports be increased by the amount of the<lb/> aid provided, however, the use of an appropriate import policy to match this requirement<lb/> prevents immiserisation. <ref type="biblio">Kemp and Kojima (1985)</ref> consider a situation where the tying takes the<lb/> form of an expenditure pattern forced on the recipient government, i.e. to spend a certain<lb/> fraction of the transfer on the importable good. In such a case, if the government&apos;s marginal<lb/> propensity to spend associated with the tying is larger than that of private agents, the<lb/> 3.<lb/> An important necessary condition for the transfer paradox to occur in such a context requires the recipient&apos;s<lb/> importable to behave like an inferior good in donor-country consumption. This may initially appear rather<lb/> pathological, but two remarks can make the case empirically plausible. First, some products (like some foods) may<lb/> well be inferior for individual consumers, implying that inferiority at the national level cannot be automatically<lb/> dismissed. Second, even when each good is normal at the individual level, national consumption may well exhibit<lb/> inferiority when there is a certain pattern of individual heterogeneity.<lb/> 4.<lb/> More specifically, the recipient cannot be impoverished if the tariff rate is adjusted to hold imports or exports to<lb/> their pre-aid level (<ref type="biblio">Ohyama, 1974</ref>).<lb/> deterioration of the terms of trade may be strong enough to induce a transfer paradox. This can<lb/> occur without existence of inferiority in national consumption patterns 5 .<lb/> Lahiri and Raimondos-Moller (1995) emphasise the importance of the form of trade policy<lb/> in its interaction with foreign aid. They consider the effect of aid when the recipient country<lb/> imposes a quantitative restriction on the importable good. A first result reveals that an increase<lb/> in untied aid unambiguously benefits the recipient country. Contrasting results emerge under<lb/> tariff or price distortions and with quantitative restrictions, where a transfer has no effect on the<lb/> wastage caused by the pre-existing distortions. Under a tariff restriction, a deterioration of the<lb/> terms of trade can reduce domestic imports, which already are too small compared with the<lb/> first-best level, therefore increasing further the wastage from the pre-existing tariff distortion.<lb/> This introduces the possibility of a transfer paradox. With a quantitative restriction, however, as<lb/> long as the restriction remains binding after the transfer, imports will not change and<lb/> consequently the transfer will generate no additional wastage. Because, in a stable two-country<lb/> world economy, the terms of trade effect can never by itself overcome the direct income effect of<lb/> a transfer, no possibility of an immiserising untied transfer can arise when the recipient country<lb/> uses quantitative restrictions.<lb/> Lahiri and Raimondos-Moller (1995) also consider tied aid that requires the recipient<lb/> country to increase imports of the commodity subject to quantitative restrictions. Such a transfer<lb/> reduces a pre-existing distortion, and one can see immediately that it improves world welfare.<lb/> Moreover, when the quantitative restriction is an import quota at less than the optimum level,<lb/> aid tied to more imports clearly also makes the recipient better off. More generally, a condition to<lb/> prevent immiserisation of the recipient country in such a situation is that the price elasticity of<lb/> the donor&apos;s export supply function must be high enough. Yet in such a case the rise in the price<lb/> of the recipient&apos;s importable necessary for the donor to be able to supply the additional demand<lb/> because of the tied transfer is relatively small. The secondary effects of the transfer via changes in<lb/> the terms of trade will be limited, and this ensures that the recipient benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>In many cases, donors earmark foreign aid to finance public consumption and public<lb/> inputs in recipient countries. This kind of aid tying can also generate endogenous distortions.<lb/> Again, changes in the terms of trade between donor and recipient open the possibility of an effect<lb/> on trade flows and the transfer paradox (<ref type="biblio">Hatzipanayotou and Michael, 1995</ref>) 6 . <ref type="biblio">Schweinberger<lb/> (2002)</ref> considers the effect of foreign aid in an economy with a public good whose labour costs<lb/> are financed by a tariff levied on a private importable good. Two interrelated distortions are<lb/> present in such an economy. First, the public good is under-supplied because of lack of<lb/> 5.<lb/> Schweinberger (1990) considers an alternative tying rule, which constrains the spending of the income by the<lb/> private sector of the economy. This type of rationing creates a wedge between domestic and foreign consumer<lb/> prices and thus opens again the possibility of a transfer paradox. It also requires, however, that the domestic<lb/> consumer price in the recipient country be lower than the consumer price in the donor country, a situation that is<lb/> clearly unsustainable under free trade.<lb/> 6.<lb/> More precisely, Hatzipanayotou and <ref type="biblio">Michael (1995)</ref> show that when the imported and public goods are net<lb/> complements, and the consumer&apos;s marginal willingness to pay for the public good is larger than its unit cost of<lb/> production (which may be expected to hold in countries with few public goods), then a small aid transfer can<lb/> reduce the welfare of the recipient country.<lb/> information or for political-economy reasons. Second, the trade policy distortion is implemented<lb/> on budgetary grounds. Tied aid in the form of an increase in the stock of the specific capital used<lb/> in producing the public good then will likely raise recipient welfare because it reduces the twin<lb/> distortions. It increases the production of the public good. If consumption of the importable is<lb/> complementary to consumption of the public good, then the transfer may in turn stimulate<lb/> imports, hence relaxing the initial tariff distortion and financing more production of the public<lb/> good.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the importance of the terms-of-trade effects induced by foreign aid, most of the<lb/> transfer literature has focused essentially on the two-country case. Yet some attention has also<lb/> gone to the impact of tied aid in a small open economy where the terms of trade remain fixed by<lb/> definition. In the seminal contribution, Johnson (1967a) showed that an exogenous increase in the<lb/> stock of a domestic resource (e.g. aid tied to this resource) may bring a welfare loss in a small,<lb/> tariff-ridden, open economy if it exacerbates overproduction in the protected import-competing<lb/> industry. Yano and Nugent (1999) extended this analysis, emphasising the importance of<lb/> &quot; non traded goods &quot; effects, meaning an expansion of the non-traded sector caused by foreign<lb/> aid. They again underline the possibility of immiserising transfer if non-traded goods are net<lb/> substitutes for protected importable goods. In such a case, the decline in the relative price of the<lb/> non-traded good resulting from the aid-induced expansion of the non-traded sector tends to<lb/> reduce the &quot; already too low &quot; imports of the recipient economy, leading to increased economic<lb/> distortions. They present empirical evidence suggesting that their non-traded-good effect<lb/> appears as more important than the standard Johnson effect in generating the possibility of<lb/> welfare-worsening impacts of foreign aid on small, open economies. <ref type="biblio">Schweinberger (2002)<lb/></ref> extends their analysis by showing how different assumptions about the mobility or immobility of<lb/> factors across industries affect the sign and magnitude of both effects. This channel for<lb/> potentially harmful effects of tied aid on trade flows and welfare contrasts with the usual &quot; Dutch<lb/> disease &quot; effect and real appreciation of the exchange rate generally mentioned in the macro<lb/> literature.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid versus Trade: Aid Flows Interacting with the Donor&apos;s Trade Policy<lb/></head>

			<p>This sub-section considers the frequently debated issue of &quot; Aid versus Trade &quot; . What is the<lb/> better way to help a recipient country — foreign assistance or export access to the donor&apos;s<lb/> markets? Formally, one needs to compare the worth to the recipient of exports to the donor&apos;s<lb/> market with that of an equal amount of foreign assistance. Johnson (1967b) again produced the<lb/> first, seminal attempt along those lines. Thirwall (1976) and Yassin (1982) extended his analysis.<lb/> The treatment here follows Mosley (1985). To compare trade with aid, three types of economic<lb/> effects have relevance. First, the direct economic effects involve how a dollar of aid compares<lb/> with a dollar of foreign exchange earned by exporting. Second, indirect effects on the recipient&apos;s<lb/> economy can occur, in particular on the public sector, the supply of savings and domestic prices<lb/> affecting the private sector. Third, more general political-economy considerations relate to the<lb/> intrinsic worth of &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>Direct Effects<lb/></head>

			<p>If aid is offered as a pure gift with no tying, it places additional resources for investment<lb/> directly in the hands of the recipient government. It thus saves the recipient country the excess<lb/> cost of import substitution, i.e. the cost of making at home the goods that aid makes it possible to<lb/> import. Following Johnson (1967b), the value of an amount of aid A is therefore equal to (1+c)A,<lb/> where c is the excess cost of import substitution. Exports do not provide additional resources for<lb/> investment directly. They do so only indirectly to the extent that they offer the possibility of<lb/> transforming domestic resources into goods more cheaply than domestic production of<lb/> importable goods, saving the excess cost of import substitution. The value of an amount X of<lb/> exports to the economy is therefore cX, and the relative worth of exports compared to pure aid<lb/> can be expressed as the cX/(1+c)A. From this, it follows that the value of exports can never exceed<lb/> the value of an equal amount of pure aid. At the margin, foreign aid is always worth more than<lb/> trade (<ref type="biblio">Johnson 1967b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Aid is rarely pure, however. It very often has a tied component related to the purchase of<lb/> goods in the donor economy or to some other potentially distortive policy action by the recipient<lb/> government, as the foregoing analysis shows. In that case, if r is the ratio of the price of goods<lb/> supplied by aid to the best competitive price obtainable on free markets, the relative worth of<lb/> exports becomes:</p>

				<formula>[cX/(1+c)A] .r.</formula>

			<p>In that case, the value of exports can exceed the value of aid<lb/> when cr &gt; 1+c which will hold only for relatively high values of c and r, that is, for countries &quot; far<lb/> enough &quot; from world markets (costly imports) and receiving relatively efficient aid (small degree<lb/> of tying). Moreover, much aid is not given on pure grant terms but as soft loans with below-<lb/>market interest rates. If F is the nominal amount of foreign assistance and g is the aid component<lb/> of assistance, the relative worth of exports becomes [cX/(1+c)<ref type="biblio">Fg]</ref>.r, and the condition for trade to<lb/> dominate aid becomes cr &gt; c(1+g). As Thirwall (1976) and Mosley (1985) argue, it remains the case<lb/> that c and r would have to be quite high and g relatively low to make such an inequality true. For<lb/> instance, for an excess import-substitution cost of 50 per cent (c = ½) and with no aid tying (r = 1),<lb/> trade would dominate aid only if the ratio of aid to assistance falls below 0.3, suggesting as<lb/> Thirwall (1976) says that aid is very likely to dominate export market access as an effective<lb/> policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Indirect Effects<lb/></head>

			<p>Export revenues and aid income also of course have indirect economic effects on the<lb/> recipient country. They may influence the propensity to save and thereby the growth rate. They<lb/> may also affect relative prices, in particular the real exchange rate, as with the Dutch disease.<lb/> They may affect public-spending patterns as well. Clearly, if these effects differ for export<lb/> revenues and aid income, then they will certainly affect the relative worth of trade compared to<lb/> aid. They also take time to emerge, over a number of periods T. In that case, the new formula<lb/> becomes:<lb/></p>

				<formula>∑<lb/> ∑<lb/> =<lb/> +<lb/> =<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> T<lb/> r<lb/> at<lb/> a<lb/> T<lb/> t<lb/> xt<lb/> x<lb/> p<lb/> s<lb/> Fg<lb/> c<lb/> p<lb/> s<lb/> rcX<lb/> 1<lb/> 1<lb/> ]<lb/> )<lb/> )<lb/> 1<lb/> [(<lb/> ]<lb/> )<lb/> [(<lb/></formula>

			<p>where sx and sa are the propensities to save out of exports and out of aid respectively, and pxt and<lb/> pat are the respective values of the indirect effects of exports and of aid, in period t. When one<lb/> takes plausible values for r (r = 50 per cent in <ref type="biblio">Thirwall, 1976</ref>), the aid component g (g = 60 per<lb/> cent in OECD, 1986) and an excess cost of import substitution c (c = 50 per cent in Little,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Scitovsky and Scott, 1970</ref>), then even for a propensity to save at say sx = sa = 0.6, export inflows X<lb/> will exceed the effects of aid inflows</p>

			<figure>Fg of equivalent dollar value when the combined indirect<lb/> effects of aid on the recipient economy ∑<lb/> =<lb/> T<lb/> t<lb/> at<lb/> p<lb/> 1<lb/> are less than 0.4 of the indirect effects ∑<lb/> =<lb/> T<lb/> t<lb/> xt<lb/> p<lb/> Adam and O&apos;Connell (2004) have also challenged the general Johnson presumption</figure>

			<p>that<lb/> aid is unambiguously better than trade to assist a recipient country. Taking an explicitly dynamic<lb/> perspective and emphasising the role of learning-by-doing externalities, they show that the<lb/> balance in such a context shifts decisively in favour of market access rather than aid. Their<lb/> starting point is the observation that, other things equal, aid reduces export competitiveness in<lb/> the recipient country by an appreciation of the real exchange rate in a variant of the classical<lb/> Dutch disease (<ref type="biblio">Van Wijnbergen, 1985</ref>). Hence a dollar of donor resources transferred via the<lb/> donor&apos;s own import liberalisation is better for the recipient&apos;s exports than a dollar transferred<lb/> through grants. When externalities to exporting not internalised by an export subsidy exist, a<lb/> shift from aid to trade by increasing the recipient&apos;s export-sector productivity may actually make<lb/> both parties better off. The authors then extend their basic theoretical setting to a more fully<lb/> articulated dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of a stylised African economy<lb/> and examine the effects of a shift at the margin from aid to tariff preferences. They calibrate the<lb/> externality spillover parameter such that the optimal subsidy fully internalising the spillover<lb/> effect corresponds to the average duty of 11.5 per cent imposed on developing countries by the<lb/> United States between 1980-85. For such values of the dynamic externality, they show that<lb/> &quot; trade &quot; is superior to &quot; aid &quot; in terms of welfare for both economies. Allowing for capital<lb/> accumulation in the model magnifies the relative knowledge externality effect. On the other<lb/> hand, when the recipient country can finance infrastructure and public capital accumulation only<lb/> through distortionary taxation, &quot; aid &quot; regains some interest because of its direct effect on the<lb/> public budget.<lb/></p>

			<head>&quot; Aid for Trade &quot; : The Complementarity between Aid and Trade Liberalisation<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite much policy discussion on the importance of aid flows as a way to facilitate trade<lb/> (the so-called trade facilitation issues) and market access, little analytical work has dealt formally<lb/> with the subject. One exception, <ref type="biblio">Lahiri et al. (2002)</ref>, uses a standard two-country, two-goods trade<lb/> model in which countries can decide strategically their optimal trade policies. (This is the usual<lb/> tariff-war argument, which can be generalised to more sensible political-economy arguments).<lb/> Additionally, one country can make an international transfer (foreign aid) to the other, which is<lb/> free to accept or refuse that aid. Given that aid is given and received only if it increases welfare in<lb/> both countries, there can be no transfer paradox. Therefore, without altruism, the only value of<lb/> aid for the donor comes from the strategic spillover effects it has on the choice of trade<lb/> instruments between the two countries.<lb/> A result of the analysis is that when its level is decided before that of tariffs, foreign aid<lb/> may induce in the recipient country a more open trade policy and therefore give the donor an<lb/> incentive to give aid in the first place. The insight relates to standard ideas on optimal tax<lb/> policies. The recipient designs its optimal trade policy such that its marginal cost in terms of<lb/> dead-weight loss on domestic production and consumption is equal to its marginal benefit,<lb/> which produces a shift in the terms of trade to its advantage. It is well known that a transfer may<lb/> under certain circumstances induce a terms-of-trade effect in favour of the recipient country. In<lb/> such situations, because the terms of trade have already moved in the right direction, the<lb/> marginal benefit to the recipient country of using trade policies to affect its terms of trade<lb/> additionally is reduced. It chooses a more open trade policy at any level of the trade policy of the<lb/> other (donor) economy. In other words, transfers do in part the work that optimal trade taxes do;<lb/> they affect world prices and are in some respects a substitute for them. As a result, foreign aid<lb/> may shift downward the tariff reaction function of the recipient economy, providing a strategic<lb/> value for the donor economy. Whether trade flows increase between the two economies then<lb/> depends on the optimal response of the donor country to less protectionism in the recipient<lb/> country. In such a setting aid tied to reduced protection in the recipient country may be<lb/> Pareto-improving for both economies, as it can be viewed as a commitment device towards trade<lb/> liberalisation. &quot; Aid for trade &quot; , in such a case, implements a better world economic resource<lb/> allocation in a way which is both credible and politically feasible.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.2 Empirical Aspects of the Interaction between Aid and Trade<lb/> From Aid Flows to Trade Flows<lb/></head>

			<p>A growing literature investigates empirically the link between aid and trade flows (A1 in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Most of the papers study the determinants of aid allocation, i.e. causality going from<lb/> trade to aid 7 . A few look at the reverse effect from aid to trade (<ref type="biblio">Morrissey, 1993</ref>). One motivation<lb/> for these papers is to assess the efficiency of tied aid, the use of which the donor determines,<lb/> generally in the form of increased imports of services or goods from the donor. A special case is<lb/> mixed credits (a mix of commercial export credit, concessional loans and pure grants). Food aid<lb/> is also a type of tied aid (see below). Other intermediary types include aid loans, soft loans,<lb/> partial grants and concessional export credits. All in all, 48 per cent of bilateral EU aid is tied on<lb/> average.<lb/> Some papers use the gravity model, with bilateral exports as a dependent variable and<lb/> bilateral aid as an explanatory variable (see <ref type="biblio">Nilsson, 1997</ref>, for EU countries and Wagner, 2003 for<lb/> a larger sample of 20 donors and 109 recipients). Wagner estimates an equation that takes into<lb/> account the possibility that the amount of aid is zero for some (donor, recipient) pairs, on a<lb/> repeated cross-section for five years during 1970-90:<lb/></p>

			<p>where Xdr represents exports from the donor d to the recipient r, Adr is the amount of aid given<lb/> by d to r, Γdr is a linear function of the usual variables in a gravity model such as the GDP of<lb/> donor and recipient, distance and dummies for a common language, remoteness of the donor<lb/> and remoteness of the recipient. Wagner controls for unmeasurable common factors by<lb/> introducing in the gravity equation the residual of a preliminary regression on imports from the<lb/> recipient to the donor. He finds an elasticity of 0.163: increasing aid to a country by 10 per cent<lb/> increases donor exports to it by 1.63 per cent. This elasticity translates into an average of<lb/> 1.85 cents of exports generated per additional dollar of aid. The effect is mostly<lb/> contemporaneous. Nilsson, on a sample restricted to EU countries during 1975-92, finds that $1<lb/> of aid generates $2.6 of exports from donor to recipient. The average estimate hides huge<lb/> discrepancies, ranging from $0.67 for Denmark to $3.85 for France. All in all, the impact on<lb/> 7.<lb/> These determinants respond either to recipient needs (humanitarian motives) or to donors&apos; interests (<ref type="biblio">McKinley and<lb/> Little, 1979</ref>). The donor might be willing to extend its political influence (aid could, for instance, incite the recipient<lb/> country to join the donor&apos;s positions in UN voting), comfort a military ally or increase its export market share.<lb/></p>

			<table>Dudley and Montmarquette (1976) build a structural model where aid enters in the utility function of the donor<lb/> country and test it in a cross section of developing countries for 1970 considering one donor at a time (hence, a<lb/> small number of observations). Most papers deal with reduced-form estimations, however. A good example with<lb/> multiple donors, recipients and years (1980-99) is Berthélemy and Tichit (2002). They find that aid will go to<lb/> countries attracting FDI from the world generally and linked to the donor by strong bilateral trade.<lb/> { }<lb/> [<lb/> ]<lb/> ln<lb/> ln<lb/> 0.163 ln (max 1,<lb/> ) 1.75<lb/> 0<lb/> dr<lb/> dr<lb/> dr<lb/> dr<lb/> dr<lb/></table>

				<formula>X<lb/> A<lb/> A<lb/> ε<lb/> = Γ +<lb/> +<lb/> =<lb/> +<lb/></formula>

			<p>exports is greater, the larger the donor country. The effect of aid on exports arises mostly from<lb/> bilateral aid as opposed to multilateral aid, for which the coefficient on exports is negative and<lb/> significant for Denmark, Italy and France.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid and Trade: What Is the Causality?<lb/></head>

			<p>The causality between aid flows and trade flows clearly can go both ways, and assessing<lb/> its main direction is important. <ref type="biblio">Lloyd et al. (2000) and Arvin et al. (2000)</ref> use Granger causality<lb/> tests. They find that the direction of causality depends on the pairing of donor and recipient<lb/> countries. In a sample of aid commitments between four EU donors and 26 African recipients<lb/> over 1969-95, Lloyd et al. find that trade determines aid for only 15 of 87 pairs (17 per cent), aid<lb/> determines trade for 13 per cent and the causality runs both ways for 7 per cent. It is hard to get a<lb/> clear picture of the link between aid and trade, even for a given donor. France could be the only<lb/> exception, where for a larger share of recipients (seven of 20, or 35 per cent) the causality runs<lb/> from aid to trade.<lb/> As a consequence of this time-series heterogeneity, one should examine the aid/trade<lb/> relationship on data pre-tested to identify sub-panels according to the direction of causality and<lb/> not, as is usually the case, on pooled panel data. When the causality goes from aid to trade, <ref type="biblio">Lloyd<lb/> et al. (2001)</ref> find that the effect is first negative and becomes positive after two years. For changes<lb/> in a recipient&apos;s shares of aid and imports respectively from a donor, an increase in the share of<lb/> aid seems indeed to have a positive effect on the share of imports. The negative effect of aid-flow<lb/> on trade-flow levels is completely ignored if the estimation is performed on the whole sample,<lb/> regardless of preliminary Granger causality tests. This means that a positive impact of aid on<lb/> trade is a spurious result that appears if the estimation coefficients are constrained to be the same<lb/> for all pairs of countries. When the causality goes from trade to aid, the effect of a change in the<lb/> trade level on aid is not significantly different from zero with control for other variables. In<lb/> contrast, a change in the import share does seem to have a positive impact on the share of aid.<lb/> Donors give more aid to recipients that buy proportionately more imports from them, reflecting<lb/> the strategic motive in aid allocation. This last result is also found on the total sample, suggesting<lb/> that it is a robust finding<lb/></p>

			<head>Food Aid 8<lb/></head>

			<p>Food aid has received special attention in the empirical literature. It is defined as an<lb/> international sourcing of concessional resources in the form of or for the provision of food (<ref type="biblio">Barett<lb/> and Maxwell, forthcoming</ref>). It comes in various types: programme aid, emergency aid or project<lb/> aid, such as food for work or supplementary feeding programmes for children and pregnant<lb/> women. It has been much criticised. It is a second-best instrument and quite expensive, even<lb/> compared with other forms of aid, because of high agricultural prices on EU and US markets.<lb/> Moreover, a rising share of processed goods in food aid favours agri-business and monopolistic<lb/> competition in food shipping. The most important distinction with respect to trade is between<lb/> 8.<lb/> This section draws on Barett and Maxwell (forthcoming), chap. 4.<lb/> food aid in kind or through money transfers. The first type can be either distributed directly or<lb/> monetised and sold on local markets. The second entails buying food either on local markets or<lb/> in third countries (triangular purchase).<lb/> The FAO ensures that food aid respects the Usual Marketing Requirements (UMR), which<lb/> are commitments to maintain normal levels of commercial food imports. The philosophy behind<lb/> the UMR is that food aid must be aid that would not otherwise be forthcoming in cash and food<lb/> that would not otherwise be purchased (<ref type="biblio">Maxwell and Singer, 1979</ref>) 9 . The UMR are based on the<lb/> assumption that the marginal propensity to consume out of in-kind aid is higher than that for<lb/> money transfers. Empirical evidence suggests that this is not the case and that food aid adds to<lb/> food consumption at roughly the same rate as cash transfers, the order of magnitude being from<lb/> 30 per cent to 60 per cent of the food aid shipped. This has to do with Engle curve and income<lb/> effects (the rise in income does not translate entirely into demand for food). Yet it might change<lb/> over time, and thus the impact of food aid on trade needs study in a dynamic perspective. <ref type="biblio">Barett<lb/> et al. (1999)</ref> do this using a vector auto-regression approach fitted on US cereal-programme food<lb/> aid sent to 18 developing countries between 1961-95. They find that in the short run commercial<lb/> imports of the recipient country indeed decrease (-30 per cent of food aid), but in the long run a<lb/> J-curve appears, and commercial imports resume after five years. This rise in imports benefits<lb/> third countries more than the donor country. A possible explanation for this long-term rise<lb/> comes from induced shifts in consumer tastes, income effects and transaction costs reduced by<lb/> the development of distribution channels 10 . Yet there are considerable differences in the<lb/> magnitudes of aid, production and trade. The mean aid volume in the sample is only 9 per cent<lb/> of mean production and 17 per cent of commercial imports. Therefore, even if the conditional<lb/> expectation of food aid&apos;s effect on commercial imports does follow a J-curve, one cannot say that<lb/> food aid drives recipient-country trade patterns.<lb/></figure>

			<p>From the viewpoint of a developing country, if food aid could substitute for commercial<lb/> imports it would in fact ease the balance of payments constraint and free resources for imports —<lb/> of investment goods, for example. It would then equate with untied financial aid, which might be<lb/> a more efficient instrument. &quot; There is a certain inconsistency in proposals which talk about food<lb/> aid as providing balance-of-payments support while insisting that developing countries cannot<lb/> be helped to pay for the food imports they are forced to make commercially. &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Maxwell and<lb/> Singer, 1979</ref>). Analysts of this issue need a clearer picture of recipient countries&apos; food trade with<lb/> donors as well as third countries. A first step in this direction is an OECD study (2004), which<lb/> suggests that the effect of aid depends on the modalities of delivery (grant or loan, programme,<lb/> 9.<lb/> In practice, the UMR sets a limit to food aid, namely average recipient-country imports of the commodity over the<lb/> preceding five years. The UMR is waived for non-governmental organisations (</p>

			<table>NGOs) and for emergency aid.<lb/> 10. Food aid, according to Barett and Maxwell, is akin to &quot; a free-sample marketing campaign &quot; . They cite anecdotal<lb/> evidence of the United States encouraging the shift from rice to wheat or from soft wheat to hard wheat in which<lb/> North America has a comparative advantage. Genetically modified (GM) food aid provides another example. In<lb/> 2002, Mozambique and Zimbabwe accepted potentially GM food aid from the United States under certain<lb/> conditions (food must be milled before shipping), but Zambia turned it down because it feared denial of market<lb/> access for its own products in Europe.<lb/> project or emergency, bilateral or multilateral) and on the product types (cereals, pulses or oils<lb/> and fats) 11 .<lb/></table>

			<p>To summarise, the literature on aid and trade flows suggests that most the impact of aid<lb/> on trade and even the direction of the causality are driven by factors related to specific<lb/> donor/recipient pairs. This justifies the use of case studies, which would scrutinise the<lb/> non-economic factors (institutions or historical ties) that could explain the specificity of the<lb/> relationships and its likely impact on trade via aid. The general empirical studies also highlight<lb/> the importance of the sectoral structures of recipient countries, distinguishing between tradables<lb/> (both exportable and import-competing goods) and non-tradables, the evolution of their relative<lb/> prices and the extent of factor mobility between the two sectors. A recipient&apos;s overall macro<lb/> environment matters too; the transfer paradox illustrates how aid can interfere with balance-of-<lb/>payments and fiscal constraints. Important features of aid in that respect concern whether it is<lb/> spent on traded or non-traded goods (say, health or education expenditures), and how it is<lb/> distributed domestically among various groups of the population. From a practical point of view,<lb/> because of the differences in magnitude between aid and trade in many countries, the<lb/> significance of the impact of aid on trade will likely depend on the types of calculation —<lb/> marginal vs. mean effects, in levels or in shares.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aid for Trade: Trade Facilitation and Tariff Compensation Schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>Trade facilitation is aid meant to alleviate the cost of suppressing barriers to trade. The<lb/> first type of such aid involves compensating schemes or monetary transfers proportional to the<lb/> losses incurred by recipient countries during trade liberalisation. This aid resembles structural<lb/> adjustment loans, which are often conditioned on indicators of trade liberalisation, but they take<lb/> place during economic crises and their conditionality extends beyond trade policies to macro<lb/> stabilisation, budgetary issues and financial-system reforms. Some regional trade agreements<lb/> include compensating transfers, e.g. the EU&apos;s structural funds 12 . In another example, the EU put<lb/> in place the MEDA funds directed to Mediterranean countries that joined a common Free Trade<lb/> Area (the Barcelona Partnership). Mediterranean countries were expected to face sharp losses in<lb/> tariff revenues following the suppression of their duties on European industrial imports. These<lb/> losses could be significant for some countries like Tunisia, which sources 70 per cent of its<lb/> imports in the EU and where tariff duties represent over 20 per cent of total fiscal revenue.<lb/> MEDA commitments for the Mediterranean countries in 1995-01 amounted to 1 805 million<lb/> euros. Of this, 59 per cent went to alleviate the macroeconomic and social costs of trade<lb/> liberalisation (balance of payments and social safety-net support), and 40 per cent was allocated<lb/> to private-sector development (vocational training, business centres and guarantees for loans by<lb/> small and medium enterprises</p>

			<table>).<lb/> 11. The methodology used in OECD (2004) has flaws. Commercial net imports, domestic production and consumption<lb/> of the recipient country are estimated separately, taking into account neither the simultaneity of the three<lb/> equations&apos; variables nor the possible endogeneity of aid.<lb/> 12. The evaluation of the impact of structural funds on the convergence of members of a regional agreement is beyond<lb/> the scope of this paper, which focuses on trade-related technical assistance.<lb/> Trade facilitation activities cover two main categories 13 :<lb/> • Trade policy and regulations: support to aid recipients&apos; effective participation in<lb/> multilateral trade negotiations, analysis and implementation of multilateral trade<lb/> agreements, trade policy mainstreaming and technical standards, trade facilitation<lb/> including tariff structures and customs regimes, support to regional agreements<lb/> and human resources development in trade; and<lb/> • Trade development: business development, access to trade finance, trade<lb/> promotion in some sectors.<lb/></table>

			<p>Until the creation of the WTO, GATT technical assistance largely took the form of<lb/> trade-policy courses. Bilateral co-operation provided the channel for most trade-related<lb/> assistance. In 1996 the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-<lb/>Developed Countries (IF) was launched. The IF brings together six-international agencies 14 to<lb/> collaborate with bilateral donors to ensure greater coherence in the provision of trade-related<lb/> technical assistance. The core of the IF is the provision of diagnosis reports, which include action<lb/> matrices stating with priority rankings the various tasks offered to external funding. An action<lb/> matrix is established at least theoretically after discussion with local stakeholders co-ordinated<lb/> by a Focal Point (usually in the</p>

			<figure>Ministry of Trade). Another initiative is the Joint Integrated<lb/> Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP), launched by the WTO, UNCTAD and the ITC in<lb/> selected Least-Developed and other African countries 15 . In 2001, the Doha Development Agenda<lb/> Global Trust Fund was launched, and the IF and JITAP were revamped and expanded in 2003.<lb/> Bilateral and multilateral trade-assistance commitments increased to a total of almost $2.8 billion<lb/> in 2003 (see WTO/OECD, 2004, for details on the distribution of these activities by donor,<lb/> recipient and category of assistance).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Trade-related assistance has faced many critiques. According to Prowse (2002, p. 1 239), it<lb/> &quot; has been delivered frequently randomly, indiscriminately and more often than not on a<lb/> stand-alone basis &quot; . She points to the lack of co-ordination between multilateral agencies involved<lb/> in capacity building, such as the IMF, ITC, UNCTAD, UNDP, the World Bank and the WTO, not<lb/> to mention other specialised agencies (BIS, FAO, ISO, UNIDO, WCO, WIPO), regional bodies<lb/> and bilateral donors. Within the WTO, the implementation of the Special and Differential<lb/> treatment, by which a least-developed country might be given longer transition periods for the<lb/> implementation of GATT/WTO obligations and maintain some trade restrictions or subsidies, is<lb/> handled by each relevant WTO committee. For instance, the Committee on Sanitary and<lb/> Phytosanitary Standards will implement an assistance programme independently from the<lb/> 13. Activities to enhance the infrastructure necessary for trade, such as transport, storage, communications or energy<lb/> are excluded.<lb/></p>

			<figure>14. These are UNCTAD, ITC, UNDP, WTO, IMF and the World Bank. The International Trade Centre (ITC) is a joint<lb/> venture of the WTO and UNCTAD. The IF received $19 million in pledges through 2003, of which around<lb/> $10 million was disbursed through 2003.<lb/> 15. The JITAP is a more a results-oriented programme than the IF. By September 2003, the JITAP had received<lb/> $12.6 million in its Common Trust Fund.<lb/></figure>

			<p>committee on Intellectual Property Law. A consequence of this fragmentation of aid is that it is<lb/> often short-lived and is not integrated in a global development strategy of the country.<lb/> The IF initiative, intended to overcome these issues, remains mostly donor-driven and<lb/> lacks local ownership. The process involves Geneva-based representatives more than local<lb/> governments, and the local IF co-ordinator (the &quot; Focal Point &quot; ) usually resides in the trade<lb/> ministry, which most often has less political muscle than Ministries such as Planning or Finance<lb/> (and Customs). More profoundly, trade-related assistance suffers from conflicting rationales<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Shaffer, 2005</ref>). One is to facilitate trade liberalisation and the implementation of WTO<lb/> agreements; the other supports trade-related aspects of development, including the capacity to<lb/> re-negotiate WTO rules from a development perspective. The present emphasis rests clearly on<lb/> the former. The first domain in which the WTO designed trade assistance activities was the<lb/> Singapore Issues, among them intellectual property rights, which might not be a first-rank<lb/> concern for the least-developed countries (LDCs). A temptation even arose to link the<lb/> continuation of trade assistance to the conclusion of the Doha negotiating round.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The fragmentation of trade-related assistance does not help an overall assessment of its<lb/> impact on trade, not to say growth. The methodology used in the few available studies estimates<lb/> the costs of trade transactions and simulates the impact of a decrease in them. No study known<lb/> to the present authors directly evaluates the impact of trade assistance on reducing trade<lb/> transaction costs. An OECD report (2003) gives some estimates of those costs. They range from<lb/> 1 per cent to 15 per cent of traded goods&apos; value. The computations are based mostly on business<lb/> surveys and make some assumptions for the opportunity costs (in monetary terms) of time delay<lb/> or inventory holding. Trade transaction costs seem higher for agricultural products (due to<lb/> additional sanitary and phytosanitary inspections). They also are higher for developing<lb/> countries, and considerable variation in border waiting times exists particularly for countries<lb/> with per capita incomes of less than $9 000.<lb/> Researchers have taken two routes based on these evaluations of trade transaction costs:<lb/> • Introducing trade transaction costs in a gravity model of bilateral trade, along<lb/></figure>

			<p>with the usual variables such as tariffs or distance. Examples are <ref type="biblio">Wilson et al.<lb/> (2003)</ref> for APEC and <ref type="biblio">Wilson et al. (2004)</ref> for a larger sample of 30 developed<lb/> countries and 45 developing countries.<lb/> • Introducing trade transaction costs in a CGE model (Hertel, 2004). Trade<lb/> facilitation is introduced as technical progress in trading activities that reduces the<lb/> cost of trading (indirect effect) and can entail a reduction in logistics duties paid to<lb/> the public sector (direct effect). Examples appear in Fox et al. (2003) and OECD<lb/> (2003).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Wilson et al. (2004)</ref> derive their measures of trade facilitation from cross-country business<lb/> surveys and build four indices — for port efficiency, the customs environment (hidden barriers<lb/> or bribes), the regulatory environment (corruption) and the service infrastructure (speed and cost<lb/> of internet access and its contribution to inventory reduction). These indicators correlate highly<lb/> with each other and with per capita incomes. The gravity model, which does not control for the<lb/> endogeneity of trade costs, shows that higher trade-facilitation index values indeed have a<lb/> positive impact on bilateral trade, especially the service infrastructure and the regulatory<lb/> environment. Full elimination of the 8.5 per cent average tariff would equate for the importing<lb/> country to improvements of 15.6 per cent in port efficiency, 17 per cent in the regulatory<lb/> environment and 6.6 per cent in the service infrastructure. The corresponding gains for the<lb/> exporter are 5.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent. The tariff elimination also is equivalent to<lb/> a 10 per cent better customs environment for the importer. When the sample is restricted to<lb/> South-North trade, variables of the North as importer, such as tariffs, are not significant. Thus,<lb/> the regression would suggest that tariffs are not an impediment to South-North trade. A high<lb/> coefficient on the regulatory environment in the exporting country (from the South) points to<lb/> possible large gains following its reform. In South-South trade, tariffs are significant and the<lb/> service infrastructure is important for trade in both directions. The estimates of the gravity model<lb/> are then used for simulation. If below-average countries are put at a level halfway to the average<lb/> for the entire set of countries, the volume of trade will increase by 9.7 per cent ($377 billion).</p>

			<figure>The<lb/> gain will be smaller for Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), sub-Saharan African and<lb/> Latin American exports than for South Asian exports, because they have less access to OECD<lb/> markets.<lb/> The CGE simulations in OECD (2003) take into account a loss in logistic duties and<lb/> reduced corruption following trade facilitation. Thus, the positive impact is attenuated by an<lb/> adjustment in the government sector. They also model diversity in trade transaction costs due to<lb/> sectors&apos; and firms&apos; heterogeneity. They show that an overall and uniform reduction of trade<lb/> transaction costs by 1 per cent of the value of world trade would entail a trade gain of $38 billion.<lb/> Reducing border waiting times accounts for 80 per cent of it. Most of it would go to OECD<lb/> countries (69 per cent) and to a lesser extent the Asia-Pacific Region. MENA and the Latin<lb/> America/Caribbean (LAC) region would each get 5 per cent of the benefit and sub-Saharan<lb/> Africa a mere 2 per cent. If the improvement in trade facilitation results in closing</figure>

			<p>the gap to best<lb/> practice (that is, the lower the initial level, the larger the improvement), non-OECD countries<lb/> receive 63 per cent of the gain in trade (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In turn, these trade gains result in a welfare<lb/> improvement of 0.13 per cent of GDP worldwide. This figure can rise to 0.85 per cent of GDP for<lb/> sub-Saharan Africa in a scenario with differential improvement in trade transaction costs. Again,<lb/> however, the study reports no results on growth or income distribution.<lb/> For least-developed countries, including many sub-Saharan African countries, the<lb/> potential benefit of trade facilitation programmes (or reductions in trade transaction costs) seems<lb/> to depend on improvement of their market access 16 . Industrialised countries have designed<lb/> preferential schemes to facilitate access to their markets for developing countries, such as the<lb/> generalised system of preferences (GSP), or more recently, the EU&apos;s &quot; Everything but Arms &quot;<lb/> initiative and the US African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA). Recent studies point to under-<lb/>use of these preferences (<ref type="biblio">Brenton, 2003; UNCTAD, 2003; Candau et al., 2004</ref>). Reasons include the<lb/> extent of product coverage (especially for agriculture and textiles) and the costs of<lb/> 16. Anecdotal evidence points to contradictory objectives in trade-related assistance and market-access policies. Bogart<lb/> and Trzeciak-Duval mention that the EU announced in February 2004 an Action plan on Commodities to favour<lb/> diversification in exports from the developing countries. Yet the EU restricted market access for some of the<lb/> commodities targeted by the action plan, such as sugar and rice (Bogart and Trzeciak-Duval, 2004, p.12).<lb/> implementation (administrative costs, rules of origin, sanitary and phytosanitary norms). Other<lb/> possible reasons lie in the temporary nature of GSP and AGOA and the contingency of some GSP<lb/> schemes on the developing exporters&apos; performance.<lb/> Table 1.

			<p>To summarise, despite some attempts to estimate the nature of trade transaction costs and<lb/> the effect of their reduction on trade flows, no study known to the authors so far has tried to<lb/> evaluate directly the impact of trade-assistance aid on the reduction of these costs. This is a<lb/> significant gap in the literature. Case studies planned for the present OECD Development Centre<lb/> project may help to bridge the gap by gathering country-level data. The many possible indicators<lb/> should include shipping and customs costs and delays at different times, including before and<lb/> after the implementation of IF or JITAP programmes. In the absence of complete evaluation of<lb/> how trade-facilitation activities affect trade flows and development outcomes, the existing<lb/> papers tend to hope that reduction in trade transaction costs will have a significant effect<lb/> provided that developing countries have sufficient market access in the North. Such arguments<lb/> might point to a possible complementarity between aid and market-access policies in the North.<lb/></p>

			<head>© OECD 2006<lb/> 28<lb/> III. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FDI AND TRADE<lb/> III.1 Conceptual Aspects<lb/> Standard Trade Theory and Factor Mobility<lb/></head>

			<p>One can consider FDI as simply a factor movement between two countries and examine<lb/> how it affects trade volumes between them (F1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In the standard Heckscher-Ohlin<lb/> model of trade with two countries, two factors and two goods, the traditional view is that factor<lb/> mobility (particularly capital mobility or FDI) substitutes perfectly for goods mobility, i.e. trade.<lb/> In the first formal exposition of this idea <ref type="biblio">Mundell (1957)</ref> noted that in the presence of tariffs, the<lb/> relatively low-priced factor in each country will be that country&apos;s abundant factor. Factor<lb/> mobility in response to international factor-price differences would thus lead to the elimination<lb/> of trade by eliminating the factor-proportion basis for it. Perfect factor mobility would produce<lb/> an international equilibrium in which factor prices and commodity prices are identical to those<lb/> characterising a free-trade equilibrium with factor immobility. According to this view, factor<lb/> movements and commodity trade are substitutes in both the welfare and volume-of-trade senses,<lb/> and more FDI flows should associate with less trade. In an important contribution <ref type="biblio">Markusen<lb/> (1984)</ref> extends the Mundell analysis to show a number of situations in which factor movements<lb/> (FDI in particular) and goods trade in fact complement one another in the sense that increased<lb/> factor movements between two economies lead increased trade flows. The basic idea considers<lb/> the following set of assumptions:<lb/> a) countries have identical relative factor endowments;<lb/> b) countries have identical technologies;<lb/> c) countries have identical homothetic preferences;<lb/> d) production has constant returns to scale;<lb/> e) production is characterised by perfect competition; and,<lb/> f) there are no domestic distortions in either country.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Under these assumptions, two countries have no reason to trade with each other.<lb/> Relaxing only assumption a) provides the standard Heckscher-Ohlin motive for trade in<lb/> commodities. <ref type="biblio">Markusen (1984)</ref> showed that retaining a) but relaxing assumptions b), d), e) or f)<lb/> provides a reason for a complementarity between factor movements and trade. The basic<lb/> intuition is that, in all of these cases at the initial trading equilibrium with no factor mobility,<lb/> there is no factor-price equalisation; a country will have a relatively high factor price for the<lb/> factor used intensively in the production of its export sector. Thus factor mobility must lead to an<lb/> inflow of the factor used intensively in the production of the export good. This in turn adds a<lb/> factor-proportion basis for trade and an increase in the volume of trade between the<lb/> two economies. Taken together, these different models suggest the general idea that trade flows<lb/> and FDI flows are substitutes in only a restricted set of circumstances. They will most likely be<lb/> complements when technologies differ across countries, when there are external or<lb/> agglomeration economies of scale, when firms compete in oligopolistic fashion and when there<lb/> are local distortions in product or factor markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Standard Trade Theory and Interactions between FDI and Trade Policies<lb/></head>

			<p>The ideas outlined above deal with commodity trade and factor movements, but they do<lb/> not address the interactions between FDI and trade policy instruments and their welfare impacts<lb/> on the host country. <ref type="biblio">Johnson (1967b)</ref> showed in an early contribution that an exogenous increase<lb/> in the stock of a domestic resource, capital for example, might bring a welfare loss in a tariff-<lb/>ridden, small and open economy if it exacerbates overproduction of the protected import-<lb/>competing industry. Clearly, if a discrepancy also arises between domestic product and national<lb/> income because the increase in the capital stock is foreign-owned (FDI), then it is even more<lb/> likely that national welfare may decrease. <ref type="biblio">Brecher and Diaz-Alejandro (1977)</ref>, Markusen and<lb/> Melvin (1979) and <ref type="biblio">Brecher and Bhagwati (1981)</ref> all note that tariff-generated FDI may reduce the<lb/> real income of the host country or even of the world as a whole. Tariffs imply that a reduction of<lb/> imports at constant terms of trade depresses national income by lowering the volume of trade. If<lb/> tariff-generated FDI has the Mundell effect of curtailing trade, this tends to lessen income in the<lb/> absence of a favourable terms-of-trade change. This result therefore reveals situations where a<lb/> tariff reduction in the host economy tends to increase the welfare gain associated with FDI flows.<lb/> Looking at instruments, this suggests that a trade liberalisation policy may complement an FDI<lb/> policy promoting capital movements.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Bhagwati and Brecher (1980)</ref> and Brecher and <ref type="biblio">Bhagwati (1981)</ref> show that free trade may<lb/> be inferior to subsidised trade or no trade for a large country when it has a foreign-owned<lb/> domestic factor of production (like FDI capital). This comes from the discrepancy in the volume<lb/> or pattern of trade between the economy as perceived in the aggregate (with both domestically<lb/> and foreign-owned factors) and the economy as perceived from the national point of view<lb/> (domestic factors only). All this line of research suggests that trade liberalisation (and even<lb/> subsidisation in some cases) in the host country may at the margin complement FDI<lb/> liberalisation from the welfare point of view, because it decreases the likelihood of the<lb/> Johnson/Bhagwati-Brecher phenomenon when an FDI inflow occurs.<lb/></p>

			<head>The New Trade Theory and Multinationals<lb/></head>

			<p>Research in the early 1980s saw the beginning of the industrial-organisation approach to<lb/> trade. It brought increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition into the general<lb/> equilibrium model of trade. Two branches of this line of research discuss the relationship<lb/> between trade and FDI. The first describes multinational and FDI activities as &quot; vertical FDI &quot; in<lb/> the sense that single-plant firms fragment the production process into stages based on factor<lb/> intensities and locate activities according to international differences in factor prices (<ref type="biblio">Helpman,<lb/> 1984, 1985; Helpman and Krugman, 1985</ref>). Multinational activity will arise between countries<lb/> that differ in factor endowments. The second branch considers &quot; horizontal FDI &quot; and emphasises<lb/> the role of firm-level and plant-level economies of scale as well as trade costs between countries<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Brainard, 1993; Markusen and Venables, 1998, 2000</ref>). Contrary to the vertical FDI model, the<lb/> horizontal FDI model predicts that, given moderate to high trade costs, multinational activity<lb/> arises between countries similar in size and relative factor endowments. <ref type="biblio">Markusen (1997, 2001</ref>)<lb/> integrated the two branches into what is now known as the &quot; capital-knowledge &quot; approach,<lb/> stressing the role of skill-intensive, knowledge-based assets that can be fragmented from<lb/> production and become joint inputs into multiple production facilities.<lb/> What does this new approach tell us about the complementarity or substitutability<lb/> between FDI and trade flows? Clearly, affiliate production and trade flows should be substitutes<lb/> in the &quot; horizontal &quot; approach, although the relationship can become subtler when the firm<lb/> produces both intermediate and final goods. It is also reasonable to say that affiliate production<lb/> complements trade in the &quot; vertical &quot; approach. Markusen and Maskus (2002) draw out the<lb/> implications of how FDI liberalisation affects trade flows. The type of FDI (and therefore the<lb/> impact on trade flows between two countries) depends on differences in country size, relative<lb/> skill endowments and trade costs. More precisely, when countries are similar in size and relative<lb/> factor endowments and trade costs are moderate to high, FDI liberalisation tends to stimulate<lb/> &quot; horizontal FDI &quot; and to reduce exports from the source country to the host country. On the other<lb/> hand, when countries differ in relative factor endowments and in size and trade costs are low,<lb/> then FDI liberalisation will likely stimulate &quot; vertical FDI &quot; and promote trade — through exports<lb/> of intermediates from the source to the host country or of assembled products from the host-<lb/>country export platform back to the source country or to a third destination.<lb/></p>

			<head>The New Trade Theory and Interactions between FDI and Trade Policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Markusen (1997) provides a variation of the same argument, concentrating directly on the<lb/> relationship between trade and investment liberalisation from the viewpoint of a small,<lb/> developing host economy facing a large, developed source country. This is one of the very few<lb/> papers that explicitly consider the degree of complementarity or substitutability between two<lb/> policy instruments rather than the relationship between trade and FDI flows (the policy<lb/> outcomes). While precise results derive from numerical simulations and therefore depend on the<lb/> configuration of parameters, three general conclusions emerge. First, investment and trade<lb/> liberalisation do not seem to be substitutes in that they often have opposite effects on important<lb/> variables (like sectoral outputs, factor rewards, etc.). Second, they have quite different effects<lb/> together than does either one alone. For instance, FDI liberalisation alone may lead to horizontal<lb/> FDI, but coupled with trade liberalisation it may promote vertical FDI. In a welfare sense, trade<lb/> and investment liberalisation serve as complements. Finally from a distributive point of view,<lb/> they may together avoid the curse of Stolper-Samuelson, in the sense that the real incomes of all<lb/> factors can rise under full liberalisation, even if the relative price of one factor may fall.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.2 Empirical Analyses of FDI and Trade<lb/></head>

			<p>Many empirical studies have examined the relationship between trade and FDI. As with<lb/> the aid and trade relationship, the outcomes are quite mixed. The difficulty arises because<lb/> empirical work must take into account different stages of production, intra-firm and inter-firm<lb/> trade and the effects on third countries. Therefore it needs very disaggregated data. The first<lb/> studies looked at the impact of FDI on exports from the point of view of the source country,<lb/> i.e. FDIN,S1 versus EN,S1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. They found that trade and investment are complements. Lipsey<lb/> and <ref type="biblio">Weiss (1981)</ref>, for instance, found a positive effect of US firms&apos; foreign production on US<lb/> exports.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. FDI/Trade Relationships<lb/> N: Home (Source) Country<lb/> S1: FDI Host Country<lb/> S2: Third Country<lb/> FDIN,S1<lb/> FDI<lb/> Trade in Intermediate<lb/> Goods (I)<lb/> IN,S1<lb/> IS2,S1<lb/> Trade in Final Goods (F)<lb/> FN,S!<lb/> Total Exports (E) of Country<lb/> S1<lb/> ES1,N<lb/> ES1,S2<lb/> EN,S1<lb/> Total Exports (E) of Country<lb/> N<lb/> EN,S2<lb/></figure>

			<p>The picture changes however, when one introduces different stages of production and<lb/> disaggregates exports into flows of intermediate and finished goods. <ref type="biblio">Lipsey and Weiss (1984)<lb/></ref> found a strong complementarity between affiliate production and exports of intermediate goods,<lb/> but no significant relationship between affiliate production and exports of finished goods.<lb/> Belderbos and Sleuwaegen (1998) find evidence of substitution between foreign production and<lb/> trade at the firm level when import protection or voluntary export restraints (VERs) threaten<lb/> firms in the destination market. This &quot; tariff jumping &quot; investment substitutes for trade, as they<lb/> show for Japanese electronic firms in Europe during 1986-88. On the other hand, Japanese firms<lb/> that acquired European firms or invested in distribution subsidiaries exported relatively more to<lb/> Europe. <ref type="biblio">Bloningen (2001)</ref>, looking at product-level data on Japanese automobiles and automobile<lb/> parts exported to or produced in the United States, identifies large substitution effects in<lb/> consumer goods between US-based affiliates and Japanese exports. On the other hand, increased<lb/> demand for imported inputs in vertical relationships stems from complementarity.<lb/> In a dynamic perspective, <ref type="biblio">Bergsten et al. (1978)</ref> found that an initial complementarity<lb/> turns to substitution as the host country gains competitiveness and becomes an export platform.<lb/> Their analysis introduces the effects on third countries (in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, ES2,S1). Trade between<lb/> affiliates (say, in countries S1 and S2) might eventually replace trade between the home country<lb/> and the affiliate in S1. Integrating both the different stages of production and the third-country<lb/> effect, Svensson (1996) shows with Swedish data that exports of intermediate goods from the<lb/> source country increase (IN,S1), and exports of final goods decrease (FN,S1), the net effect being<lb/> close to zero and negative when the third-country effect is taken into account (the replacement of<lb/> exports from the source country to the third country, EN,S2, by exports from the host country,<lb/> ES1,S2).<lb/> The relevant question for developing countries will concern the impact of inward FDI on<lb/> their exports and imports. In terms of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, answering it would require data on gross exports<lb/> and imports of source and the host countries and restricting the sample to North-South FDI.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Fontagné and Pajot (1997, 1999</ref>) take a first step in this direction by distinguishing inward and<lb/> outward FDI on the one hand and exports and imports on the other. They show clearly<lb/> asymmetric effects for a given country. The samples, however, contain data on 14 industrial<lb/> countries (11 in Europe, the United States, Japan and the EU12) and one &quot; partner country &quot; which<lb/> accounts for the rest of the world. In fact, they work with two datasets, one disaggregated at the<lb/> industry level for France only, the other taking FDI as a whole for 14 declaring countries facing<lb/> 15 partners over the years 1984-93. Their regression takes the form:<lb/></p>

In manufacturing, a $1 FDI outflow from France generates<lb/> 24 cents of imports from the host country, but the trade balance is in favour of France, with a net<lb/> export of 35 cents. The result is robust to the introduction of productivity effects (economies of<lb/> scale) or to considering all sectors. In the larger data set, an FDI outflow of $1 generates 31 cents<lb/> of imports. But again, the foreign investment creates net exports from the source country of $1.86<lb/> (=2.17-0.31). Thus foreign investment creates net exports for a source country, revealing a<lb/> complementarity between FDI and trade for the source country and a substitution for the host<lb/> country. This analysis ignores potential productivity benefits arising from importing inputs that<lb/> might be sophisticated enough to entail technology transfers.<lb/> A proper testing of the FDI-trade relationship is difficult in a way similar to testing the<lb/> aid and trade relationship, because of problems of simultaneity (endogeneity of FDI in the trade<lb/> equation) and direction of the causality. Moreover, theory predicts that firms&apos; heterogeneity<lb/> matters. If FDI is vertical, multinational firms split their stages of production among various<lb/> locations, which will likely enhance trade. If FDI is horizontal, they produce final goods in<lb/> multiple locations, which will likely substitute for trade. Unfortunately, there is no way to<lb/> distinguish between horizontal and vertical FDI in the data.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Amiti and Wakelin (2003)</ref> address these problems in a novel way. They start from<lb/> Markusen&apos;s model (1997) and derive testable implications for complementarity or substitution<lb/> between trade and FDI depending on the size of the countries, differences in factor (skill)<lb/> endowments and trade costs. They estimate a gravity model of bilateral exports as a function of<lb/> trade and investment costs in the countries of origin and destination of exports. They measure<lb/> investment costs by an index of various impediments to investment (government restrictions on<lb/> foreign companies, immigration rules, restrictions on raising capital and anti-trust laws) 17 . They<lb/> also introduce interaction terms of investment costs with differences in country size and in skill<lb/> endowments. The interaction terms are meant to capture the non-linearity in the relation<lb/> between trade and FDI liberalisation. The model is estimated for each year from 1986-94 on a<lb/> sample of 36 countries including 13 developing countries. Of particular note are the partial<lb/> derivatives of exports with respect to investment costs in the destination and origin countries of<lb/> the trade flows (reproduced here for 1994):<lb/></p>

The investment cost index is the simple average of scores from the World Economic Forum surveys on foreign<lb/> investor controls, immigration laws, cross-border ventures, hiring practice, anti-trust laws, state of justice, state of<lb/> capital markets, and protection of intellectual property rights.

			<p>where Xij is the export of manufactured goods from country i to country j, DYijt is the difference in<lb/> real GDP, DSKILLijt is the absolute difference in relative skill endowments and TCi is the trade<lb/> cost in country i defined as an index ranging from 0 to 100, constructed from the World<lb/> Competitiveness Report, where companies are asked whether national protectionism prevents<lb/> foreign goods from being imported 18 .<lb/></p>

			<p>An investment liberalisation in country j stimulates exports to it when the origin and<lb/> destination countries differ in relative labour-skill endowments (the coefficient on ln ICj* ln<lb/> DSKILLij is negative) but reduces exports when trade costs are high (the coefficient on ln ICj*ln<lb/> TCj is positive). Therefore, investment liberalisation in the North should enhance exports from<lb/> developing countries, as long as trade costs are not too high. On the other hand, if country i<lb/> reduces its investment cost, the difference in skills between the two countries does not matter for<lb/> trade flows and the trade-cost variable switches sign from negative in the early years to positive<lb/> after 1991. The interactive term between investment cost and country size (ln DYij*ln IC) has an<lb/> unexpected positive sign. Amiti and Wakelin relate that finding to the replacement of national<lb/> firms likely to be big exporters by multinationals when investment costs fall.<lb/> To summarise, Amiti and Wakelin find that when factor endowments are different in<lb/> two countries and trade costs are low, vertical FDI will occur, enhancing intra-firm trade and<lb/> increasing exports, provided that the difference in country size is not too large. When the<lb/> two countries are similar in factor endowments and trade costs are high, horizontal FDI that will<lb/> substitute for exports becomes more likely. Using data from 1994, they show that 70 per cent of<lb/> their sample exhibits a negative derivative for<lb/></p>

			<p>complementarity between<lb/> investment liberalisation and trade. The average elasticity was –0.15 in 1994, down from –0.53 in<lb/> 1986. As country characteristics and trade costs change over time, the impact of investment<lb/> liberalisation on trade does not stay constant either. The implication for a developing country<lb/> would be that investment liberalisation should accompany trade liberalisation in order to<lb/> magnify the complementarity between trade and investment, which the difference in factor<lb/> endowments will enhance. All in all, the empirical literature on the impact of FDI on trade<lb/> suggests complementarity for developing countries. The result is specific, however, to the type of<lb/> FDI (horizontal or vertical), the stage of production (intermediate or final) touched by the FDI<lb/> inflow and the potential technological spillovers associated with it. Third-country effects seem<lb/> important, as well as the evolution over time. All these parameters are difficult to gather, but<lb/> doing so might be feasible for some case studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>This survey has some implications for the case studies envisioned in the current OECD<lb/> Development Centre project. What has this review of the literature revealed? A first, quite robust<lb/> element is the identification of complementarity between trade and FDI flows and policies. There<lb/> are theoretical arguments for it, and the few empirical papers addressing this issue directly<lb/> support them. An important policy implication, however, lies in the risk of a two-tier system in<lb/> which emerging developing countries (East Asia, South Asia and China) would attract both<lb/> investment and trade while other less-developed economies (in sub-Saharan Africa) would not.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, the literature so far does not provide straightforward and robust<lb/> results on complementarity between aid and trade flows. Yet there is a presumption of possible<lb/> complementarity between aid and trade policy that would reduce domestic distortions in the<lb/> developing country (e.g. provision of a public good or domestic market reforms). In the classical<lb/> &quot; aid vs. trade &quot; debate, the theoretical arguments would urge aid, a more direct instrument, over<lb/> market access. The balance might change, however, if countervailing terms-of-trade effects are<lb/> significant (immiserising aid) and if learning through exports is possible through productivity<lb/> gains in exporting firms that might spill over to non-exporting firms. These conditions seem<lb/> relevant for a stylised African economy but remain to be verified in real cases. The reasoning<lb/> treats only marginal effects, however.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cross-country empirical literature, while suggesting some complementarities across<lb/> policy areas like trade, FDI and aid policies, faces a number of important limitations that more<lb/> detailed case-study analyses may overcome. First, most complementarity results are based on<lb/> measures of flows rather than of the policy instruments. This causes problems because many<lb/> different unobserved factors may affect the relationships between instruments and observed<lb/> flows. Second, these analyses do not take into account how institutional details may affect the<lb/> pattern of complementarities across policy areas in a given country. This may be crucial for<lb/> policy implementation. Third, cross-country analyses give an aggregate view of the policy areas<lb/> under investigation. They do not distinguish between various instruments within a given policy<lb/> area (trade, FDI or aid) and therefore give at best an average view of the impacts of these<lb/> instruments and their interactions. They also are ill suited for understanding the impact of<lb/> lagged effects and interactions, because the identification power of the regressions often comes<lb/> more from inter-country variability than from time variability. Finally, they consider aggregate<lb/> policy impacts in countries without discussing the distributive implications within them. This<lb/> precludes the consideration of political-economy issues, which again may be quite important.<lb/> Country case studies can overcome some of these problems, particularly by<lb/> disaggregating policy instruments. Policies for trade, FDI and aid are in fact multidimensional<lb/> vectors. More formally, for a given country i, policy vectors could be defined as <ref type="biblio">[Trdkt]</ref>, <ref type="biblio">[Frdkt]</ref> and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Ardkt]</ref>, where T, F and A correspond to trade, FDI and aid policies, and r refers to the recipient or<lb/> host country, d to a donor or source country interacting with i, k to a particular policy instrument<lb/> and t to a time period. The disaggregation of the policy vector Z ε {T,F,A} between policy<lb/> instruments may have important implications for bringing to light the issue of substitutability or<lb/> complementarity between two instruments within and across policy areas. First, two different<lb/> instruments, Zk and Zk&apos;, within the same policy area, Z ε {T,F,A}, may indeed have differential<lb/> impacts when interacting with another policy area, W ε {T,F,A}. Think, for instance, of tariffs<lb/> versus quantitative restrictions within the trade policy vector T. It is well known that they may<lb/> have different economic impacts, making it quite likely that they may also have different<lb/> interactions with another policy vector like F (FDI) or A (aid). Second, two instruments, Zk and<lb/> Wk񮽙 in two different policy vectors, Z ε {T,F,A} and W ε {T,F,A}, may also generate different<lb/> forms of complementarity or substitution than two other instruments, Zk񮽙񮽙 and Wk񮽙񮽙 &apos; in their<lb/> respective policy areas. Disentangling these finely grained forms of interaction goes beyond<lb/> analyses based on average measures of policy and may be quite important for effective policy<lb/> implementation. The disaggregation of the policy vectors of the source/donor country, Zd and<lb/> Zd&apos;, is also important. It should naturally illuminate the question of policy coherence and<lb/> complementarity in these countries. It may also reveal how for a given country different<lb/> instruments within or across policy areas interact with those of another source/donor country.<lb/> Finally, the time dimension t is obviously important, to exploit the dynamics of interactions<lb/> across policy areas and understand the nature of lags and delays that may appear in country i.<lb/> Country case studies can more closely investigate three key issues. First, they can<lb/> characterise more precisely the local determinants of complementarity between policy areas.<lb/> Case studies may allow more focus on how other domestic market distortions (like labour or<lb/> capital market distortions) and local governance problems (corruption, local capture and politics)<lb/> may interfere with policy and the implementation of particular instruments within each policy<lb/> area. Second, they can explore distributive and political-economy questions. Typically, one may<lb/> expect from case studies a more disaggregated view of the impact and interactions of various<lb/> policies. Understanding who are the likely winners and losers can be important for the political<lb/> feasibility of implementing policy reforms. Finally, case studies can detect how interactions<lb/> across policy areas diffuse over time within the economy and how temporary or permanent<lb/> shocks may affect them. Here, the task is to identify the importance of lags and delays and the<lb/> role of expectations of future policy changes.</p>
