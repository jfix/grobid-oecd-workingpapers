ratings provided by OECD-based firms and remittance flows. Previous upsurge episodes 
in remittance flows have underlined the interactions between sovereign ratings and 
remittances. Today, in a context of shrinking world GDP growth, remittances are also 
affecting ratings in emerging economies. In May 2009, Standard & Poor's lowered El 
Salvador's credit rating, underlining the country's poor performance in consumption, 
investment and exports, as well as the significant drop in remittances. In the same line, 
Moody's Investor Service explained that the Philippines's economic slowdown was due 
to the decline in remittances, which account for more than 10 per cent of domestic output 
and are a major driver of consumption. This work assesses the influence of workers' 
remittances for rating agencies, with special focus on Latin America. Besides, it proposes 
a methodology for assigning ratings to unrated and remittance-dependent countries. This research has several policy implications. First, remittance flows may have an 
influence on low and middle income countries in Central America and the Caribbean, 
therefore affecting their access to capital markets. Second, their impact depends more on 
the reduction of the volatility of external flows than on the improvement of the solvency 
ratio (debt over exports and remittances). Third, other risk indicators such as the 
reduction of debt service or the lowering of the foreign currency debt are more relevant 
to explain ratings in the region. Finally, this paper provides sovereign ratings for a group 
of countries not covered by rating agencies (i.e. shadow ratings). With this aim, some 
public-private ventures have been set up in the past. However, other types of 
partnerships can also be envisaged at the inter-governmental level, involving public 
officials with an interest in these regions. For instance, public donors from both OECD 
and non-OECD countries, may be interested to deploy an initiative for sovereign rating's 
coverage, as a way to enhance countries' financial visibility and encourage cooperation. This study is a background paper for the upcoming Latin American Economic 
Outlook 2010, focused on migration and development in Latin America, providing 
technical support for the chapter on Remittances and the Capital Markets in Latin America.

source de financement majeure pour les pays en développement. En plus de leur impact 
microéconomique sur les ménages, ces transferts financiers sont devenus un facteur important 
de stabilité macroéconomique, contribuant à réduire la volatilité des flux de capitaux et le risque 
de dégradation de la balance des comptes courants, renforçant ainsi la solvabilité. A partir d'une 
étude portant sur 83 pays en développement et couvrant la période 1993-2006, nous analysons 
l'impact de ces transferts financiers sur la notation souveraine. D'abord, nous considérons les 
déterminants traditionnels des ratings souverains et déterminons dans quelle mesure ces envois 
de fonds sont pris en compte. Ensuite, nous construisons un modèle pour les pays qui sont les 
premiers récipiendaires de ces transferts afin de mesurer leur effet potentiel sur les notes des 
trois grandes agences, Fitch, Moody's et S&P. Finalement, nous attribuons des ratings aux pays 
latino-américains non notés pour lesquels ces transferts financiers sont élevés. Nous concluons 
que les agences de notation tiennent compte de ces transferts dans leur appréciation du risque 
souverain pour un petit nombre de pays; les États en question étant généralement de petite taille 
et ayant un niveau de revenus faible ou intermédiaire. Ces résultats nous permettent enfin de 
tirer toute une série de recommandations d'ordre politique pour améliorer la couverture des 
ratings. Mots clés: envois de fonds des travailleurs, notations souveraines, marchés de capitaux

addition to the microeconomic impact at the household level, remittances have grown into an 
important pillar of macroeconomic stability, reducing volatility of external flows, lessening the 
probability of current account reversals, thus strengthening creditworthiness. By studying 83 
developing countries covering the period 1993-2006, we analyse the impact of workers' 
remittances on sovereign rating assessment. First, we look at the traditional determinants of 
sovereign ratings and assess to what extent remittances are taken into account. Second, we build 
a model for high-remittance receptors to capture the potential effect that remittances may have 
on Fitch, Moody's and S&P ratings. Third, we assign ratings to unrated Latin American countries 
for which remittance flows are generally high. Our conclusion supports the view that credit 
rating agencies (CRAs) do take remittance flows into account to rate sovereigns. Nevertheless, 
this variable turns out to be significant for a limited set of countries, small in size and classified in 
the low and middle income categories. We derive policy implications and recommendations 
from our findings for boosting rating coverage. Keywords: remittances, sovereign ratings, emerging and developing capital markets, 
sovereign risk. 
JEL Classification: F3, F24, G24, O11. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 8 © OECD 2009 I. INTRODUCTION Research on the access of sovereigns to international capital markets suggests that 
sovereign creditworthiness could be improved by including remittance flows in key 
indebtedness indicators, such as debt-to-exports and debt service to current account ratios. These 
have been identified in the literature as common determinants of sovereign ratings (Ratha, 2005; 
World Bank, 2006). Two series of surveys at the crossroads of the literature on sovereign ratings and 
remittance flows are worth mentioning. First, Ratha et al. (2007) define a standard ratings model 
and find that a number of unrated countries would be likely to have higher ratings than 
expected, notably on account of foreign currency inflows such as remittances. According to 
Ratha (2005),  " country credit ratings by major international rating agencies often fail to account 
for remittances " . Second, rating agencies note in their country studies that remittances matter to 
determine ratings for countries in which this flow is considerable. At a time when economic 
growth was still high, Fitch – Fitch Ratings -(2008b) underlined that remittance flows could 
positively impact ratings (e.g. El Salvador). Fitch comments are consistent with its sovereign 
methodology that  " takes into account the volatility and potential vulnerability of receipts, such 
as remittances, to domestic and external shocks "  (Fitch 2007). In its outlook for Mexico, S&P -
Standard and Poor's -(2005) stressed remittances' importance as an income source for the 
balance of payments, and their impact on other determinants of sovereign ratings, such as public 
finances. More recently, in May 2009, S&P lowered El Salvador's credit rating to  " BB "  from 
 " BB+ " , stating that  " the weak performance in 2009 is due to falling consumption, investments, 
and exports as a result of a significant pass-through from the global recession "  and that 
 " remittances from the United States fell by 8 per cent in the first two months of the year " . 1 In the 
same way, in February 2009, Moody's – Moody's Investors Service -highlighted that, for a 
country like the Philippines, a slower economic growth for 2009 would also be explained by a 
decline in remittances, which account for more than 10 per cent of domestic output and are a 
major driver of consumption. 2 Despite these stylised facts, little research has been devoted to analyse the impact that 
remittances have on sovereign ratings assigned by CRAs. Our paper attempts to address this 
issue by building a rating model over a long time span (1993-2006), and estimating the ratings of 
the three main CRAs for a sample of 83 emerging countries. This study aims at answering four 
key questions: how can we capture the effect of remittances on ratings? Do rating agencies really 
take remittances fully into account in their analyses? What is the potential effect of remittances 1  " S&P lowers El Salvador rating to 'BB' from 'BB+' " , Reuters, May 12, 2009 (online article). 
2  " Moody's: Slowing remittances hurt RP " , Manila Bulletin, February 14, 2009 (online article). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 9 when included in market variable estimations? And finally, what is the  " shadow rating "  for 
unrated countries highly dependent on remittances? With this purpose, it is crucial to understand why CRAs should take remittances into 
consideration when assigning ratings. Although the effects of workers' remittances at the macro 
and the micro level have been largely studied (see World Bank, 2006 for a review of the 
literature), the evidence of the implications for capital markets actors and market sentiment is 
still scarce. This issue is crucial given the importance of remittance flows towards the developing 
world. The central empirical analysis of this paper makes a focus on Latin America, where 
remittances reach high levels both in absolute values (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, 
El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Ecuador) and with respect to the size of the economies (e.g., 
Guyana, Honduras, Haiti, Jamaica, El Salvador). Nevertheless, differences among countries in 
the region remain important. Figure 1 shows that remittances are prominent for Central 
American and Caribbean countries. Figure 1. Remittances in Latin America – 2007 0.0

In order to capture the effects of remittances, we have to focus on the country's Balance 
of Payments, which is part of any government's financial strength (see Moody's 2008b for the 
importance of balance of payment considerations in determining ratings). First, we analyse a 
common channel to measure the importance of remittances in sovereign risk assessment (Ratha 
2005, World Bank 2006). We wonder to what extent remittances can contribute to improve 
sovereign ratings when they are included in a traditional solvency ratio (i.e. the debt to exports 
of goods and services ratio). Second, we introduce the volatility of external flows (FDI flows, 
Portfolio flows, ODA, Bank loans, Exports and Remittances) as additional variable explaining 
sovereign ratings. These flows are particularly important for Latin America, where saving rates Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 10 © OECD 2009 are low and dependence on external financing is high. Our results show that remittances can 
reduce volatility of external flows owing to their stability (when compared to other flows) and 
their low correlation with other external flows. Figure 2 exhibits the volatility of major external 
flows to Latin American countries over the period 1992-2007. 3 Figure 2. Volatility of External Flows Over GDP in Latin America (1992-2007) 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 Remittances

financial flows (Ratha 2004).4 Remittances, in the same way as foreign investment or exports, are 
important items in the balance of payments, contributing to mitigate credit risk at the country 
level. More precisely, remittances strengthen financial stability by reducing the probability of 
current account reversals (Bugamelli and Paterno, 2005). This, in turn, can be related to the 
probability of default studied in country risk models. In the same way, remittances can have a 
countercyclical effect in most countries of the region, thus significantly reducing growth 
volatility (Fajnzylber and Lopez 2007).5 Of course, as pointed by the report Close to Home, the 3 Figures 3a and 3b (section III) disclose volatility of inward external flows with and without workers' 
remittances for Latin American countries. 
4 See Esteves and Khoudour-Castéras (2009) for similar findings regarding the late 19th century. 
5 However, as pointed out elsewhere, migrant-based income can become costly to emerging countries 
when resources are mismanaged. Remittances may reduce the government's incentive to maintain 
fiscal policy discipline (Chami et al., 2008). Moreover, this dependence raises a moral hazard problem OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 11 comprehensive World Bank study on Latin America, remittances are an engine for development, 
but they are neither  " manna from heaven "  nor a substitute for sound development policies. The remainder of this article is organised as follows. In section II, we provide a review of 
the literature on sovereign ratings and in particular on the relevance of sovereign ratings for 
emerging economies as well as the determinants of these ratings. Section III presents the most 
important stylised facts and analyses the results of the econometric model. In particular, this 
section emphasizes the impact of remittance flows on ratings. We also provide an empirical 
analysis for countries with a high share of remittances (as a percentage of GDP). Finally, section 
IV provides concluding remarks and sketches the major policy implications that follow from this 
research. by reducing the political will to implement reforms and pushing real exchange appreciation. These 
findings are consistent with Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) who relate higher remittance flows to 
the reduction of the receiving country's competitiveness. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 12 © OECD 2009 II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Two dimensions are related to the analysis of rating agencies. The first considers the 
impact of ratings on capital markets. The second, where a vast and relevant literature exists, 
studies the determinants of ratings. Focusing on the impact on capital markets, Kaminsky and Schmukler (2001) find that 
downgrades and upgrades have an impact on country risk and stock returns: these rating 
changes are transmitted across countries, with neighbour-country effects being more significant. 
They conclude that rating agencies may contribute to heighten financial instability. The study of 
sovereign risk assessment has mainly focused on comparing ratings to market spreads. For the 
period 1987-1994, Cantor and Packer (1996) find a greater impact on spreads from a rating 
change in the case of Moody's or if it is related to speculative-grade countries. Reisen and Von 
Maltzan (1999) show that, during the period 1989-1997, Fitch, Moody's and S&P downgrades 
have a significant impact on spreads, contrary to upgrades, which were anticipated by the 
market. For them, sovereign ratings have the potential to moderate euphoria among investors on 
emerging markets but rating agencies failed to exploit that potential in the 1990s. Sy (2001) 
highlights the strong negative relationship between ratings and EMBI+ spreads declines during 
periods of high risk aversion (e.g., 1997-1998). Mora (2006) examines Moody's and S&P ratings 
and concludes that the procyclicality of ratings is not ascertained when considering the post 
Asian crisis years. Analysing sovereign ratings issued by the three agencies for 1993-2007, 
Gaillard (2009) finds that the procyclicality of ratings was much sharper during periods of high 
risk aversion (1997-1998 in particular) than periods of low risk aversion (2005-2007). He also 
highlights the greater stability of Moody's ratings. In a different way, Cavallo, Powell and 
Rigobon (2008) develop a simple Hausman specification test and find that there is some 
informational content in sovereign ratings that is not completely captured by market spreads. 
Additional tests reinforce their conclusion that ratings matter. Lastly, going beyond the 
traditional  " ratings vs. spreads "  view, Roubini and Manasse (2005) present an original sovereign 
risk assessment methodology by using a binary recursive tree. With this approach, they discuss 
appropriate policy options to prevent crises. A key result that follows from this research is that 
ratings do matter and they are an important piece to understand the behaviour of capital 
markets. The literature focusing on sovereign ratings methodology has expanded since the mid 
1990s. Cantor and Packer (1996) identify five variables that may explain S&P and Moody's 
sovereign ratings: per capita income, inflation, external debt ratio, the indicator for economic 
development and the default history. Jüttner and McCarthy (2000) show that Cantor and 
Packer's model becomes less accurate after the Asian crisis. They suggest that the determinants 
of 1998 ratings are the current account balance, the indicators for economic development and OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 13 default history, the interest rate differential vis-à-vis the USD, and the range of problematic 
assets. Nevertheless, several follow-up studies corroborate Cantor and Packer's results. For 
Afonso (2003), the most significant variables for 2002 ratings (per capita income, inflation, 
indicators for economic development and default history) are already determinants for Cantor 
and Packer. Moody's own study (Moody's, 2004) produces a similar finding: two of their four 
explanatory variables (per capita GDP and external debt) are the same as Cantor and Packer's. 
Moody's main finding is the incorporation of a political variable that significantly improves the 
model. For Rowland (2005), the level of international reserves as a share of GDP, and the 
openness of the economy are additional relevant determinants. Sutton's (2005) findings are 
consistent with previous papers. He also considers the maturity structure of international 
banking claims against both private and public sector entities in the country as a significant 
variable. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 14 © OECD 2009 III. EMPIRICAL MODEL III.1. Data Description As noted in the previous section, the literature on sovereign ratings is extensive. We have 
tried to focus on the most representative work to identify the variables considered by agencies 
when assigning a rating to public borrowers. The traditional approach in the literature has 
consisted in regressing the dependent variable (i.e. sovereign rating) on a series of 
macroeconomic and institutional indicators. Table 1 summarizes the period and variables used by Cantor and Packer (1996), Rowland 
and Torres (2004), Sutton (2005) and Mora (2006) to analyse the determinants of sovereign 
ratings. All these articles study as a determinant of sovereign ratings the solvency ratio (i.e. 
external debt over exports), a key variable in our analysis. Whereas Cantor and Packer's and 
Sutton's analyses are based on a cross-country study, Rowland and Torres and Mora use panel 
data to estimate rating determinants. Most of these studies use one or more of the available 
ratings published by the three main rating agencies, Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch.

models. Table 1. Summary of Models and Variables Year

country's fundamentals and, in contrast with sovereign spreads (e.g., Eichengreen and Mody, 
2000), only domestic factors are analysed. More precisely, macroeconomic conditions (e.g., 
inflation rate, GDP growth), solvency ratios (e.g., external debt over exports, external debt 
service over GDP) and structural aspects (e.g. GDP per capita, economic development) are 
employed as determinants of sovereign ratings. 6 In this paper we use data on annual ratings from the three main rating agencies: Standard 
and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. The covered period is 1993-2006, the frequency is annual and the 
initial sample includes 83 rated countries (excluding High Income countries according to World 
Bank's definition). Ratings are transformed linearly (Table 2). Table 2. Linear Transformation of Ratings S&P

(1999) used both a linear and a nonlinear transformation of ratings. Their nonlinear transformation was based on 
secondary market interest rate spreads. Such a transformation is impossible for our sample, due to the lack of data for 
several countries. 6 Interestingly, the exchange rate is not directly studied in the standard models of sovereign ratings. However, balance 
of payments' variables (which affect the exchange rate) are studied as determinants of sovereign ratings. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 16 © OECD 2009 Macroeconomic data come from the World Development Indicators and the International 
Financial Statistics. The source of national debt data is the Global Development Finance (World 
Bank). Table 3 provides a résumé of the main macroeconomic variables used across the different 
rating models. In particular, exports data come from the Global Development Finance (GDF) and 
workers´remittancesworkers´remittances figures come from the International Financial Statistics (IFS). 7 7 
Data on exports from the Global Development Finance also include total workers' remittances 
registered in the Balance of Payments. The GDF defines Exports of Goods, Services and Income (XGS) as 
the total value of goods and services exported, and receipts of compensation of employees, and 
investment income. In order to calculate our solvency ratio we first exclude workers' remittances and 
compensation of employees from the XGS variable (solvency ratio without remittances) and then we 
include workers' remittances (from the IFS) in the denominator of the solvency ratio (solvency ratio 
with remittances). Workers' remittances, a transfer and not an income entry in the balance of 
payments, are treated as compensation of employees in Global Development Finance because they are 
often uneasy to distinguish from compensation of non-resident workers and migrants. We therefore 
have usually workers' remittances and compensation of employees contained in the Export series. 
Workers' remittances and compensation of employees comprise current transfers by migrant workers, 
wages and salaries earned by non-resident workers. In addition, migrants' transfers, a part of capital 
transfers, are treated as workers' remittances in Global Development Finance. We therefore restrict 
our analysis to the series of  " workers remittances " , and exclude compensation of employees and 
migrants' transfers (as estimated by GDF database). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 17 Table 3. Descriptive Statistics for Variables (1993-2006) Variables

(2009), Moody's (2009), S&P (2009). III.2. Testing Previous Models for Sovereign Ratings: The Effect of Remittances We first test the four representative models proposed in the literature. This research has 
used the solvency ratio (i.e. total external debt-to-exports ratio) as a significant and key variable Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 18 © OECD 2009 to explain sovereign ratings. We intend to identify the most relevant determinants of ratings. In 
contrast to previous studies, our sample includes a large number of countries and covers a 14-
year period. We run OLS and fixed-effect panel data regressions, using the sovereign rating of 
the three rating agencies as the dependent variable. 8 Moreover, we are interested in analysing the impact of remittances on rating agencies. As 
presented, remittance flows can be shock absorbers for the economy and play a role in reducing 
the country's vulnerability. More generally, remittances can improve creditworthiness and 
thereby facilitate access to international capital markets. We introduce remittances in the solvency ratio's denominator to capture the entire effect 
of the current account incomes, as our second core variable (i.e. volatility of external flows) is not 
studied in the literature. These revenues in the balance of payments may serve as a cushion 
against external shocks and then reduce the risk of default on external debt. In fact, since we are 
interested in the country's capacity to pay the entire total external debt (private and public), it is 
relevant to include remittances in this ratio, to capture total incomes received by nationals in the 
balance of payments. Annex 1 exhibits the evolution of our solvency ratio for Latin American and Caribbean 
countries, where the relative impact of remittances in debt indicators remains heterogeneous. In 
general, the effect of remittances is higher in Central American and Caribbean countries (e.g., 
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Jamaica) than in other countries of the region 
(e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela). Following the literature review, we opt for testing our hypothesis on a group of models 
on sovereign ratings. Annex 2 summarises results of four representative models (Cantor and 
Packer, 1996; Rowland and Torres, 2004; Sutton, 2005; Mora, 2006), for the three agencies over the 
period 1993-2006. To quantify the impact of remittances on sovereign ratings, we test these 
standard models for ratings by excluding/including the flow of remittances in the external debt 
to exports ratio. More precisely, we use both ratios, total debt over exports of goods and services, 
and workers' remittances (TDX ) and total debt over exports of goods and services ( wr 
TDX _ ). Results in Annex 2 show that, for most models, the ratio debt over exports (with or 
without remittances) is negative and significant for the three agencies. 9 Indeed, it is a key and 
relevant variable explaining sovereign ratings. For instance, taking Cantor and Packer (1996) 
model, columns 1 to 6 in Annex 2a show that the foreign currency debt to exports ratio is 
statistically significant at 1 per cent and negatively correlated with sovereign ratings. In addition to this ratio, other variables are crucial to explain ratings: GDP per capita, 
inflation rate, the historical default and the institutional stability (see Cantor and Packer, 1996; 
and Moody's, 2004). Finally, when comparing the impact of including and excluding remittances 
on the ratio debt over exports, the value of the coefficient is almost the same for both cases (in 
absolute terms), for all rating models studied. These results suggest that the impact of workers' remittances on CRAs' sovereign 
methodologies is small. Indeed, an inclusion of remittances implies a reduction of the solvency 8 OLS estimations are not reported but can be provided upon request. 
9 The exception is the estimation of Fitch ratings by Mora (2006). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 19 ratio and consequently a higher coefficient (in absolute value) can then compensate for the 
 " remittances effect "  in the sovereign rating. This finding is explained empirically for our general 
model. III.3. Proposing a General Model and Testing Effect from Remittances Traditional models on the determinants of ratings include a solvency indicator, such as 
the debt to exports ratio. By introducing remittance flows (as suggested by Ratha, 2005), we have 
tested if they play a role in reducing external vulnerabilities. In addition, we introduce a 
consistent explanatory variable for sovereign ratings in which remittances can play a crucial role: 
the volatility of external flows. As specified above, when compared to other external flows (i.e. exports, portfolio flows, 
FDI flows, ODA), remittances display a much lower volatility and lower correlation to these 
flows; they can act as a cushion vis-à-vis capital flights. We assess the volatility of external flows 
as a second channel through which remittance flows are likely to affect sovereign ratings. Our 
hypothesis is that remittances can reduce the total volatility of inward external flows, which is 
itself a powerful explanatory variable for sovereign ratings. We use the variance as a measure of external flows volatility. We decompose the variance 
of inward external flows as follows: ( ) ∑

some South and Central American countries with high levels of remittances over GDP (i.e. El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras and Colombia). Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 20 © OECD 2009 Figure 3a. Average Volatility of External Flows With and Without Workers' Remittances

β measure the elasticity of sovereign ratings with respect to the debt to exports ratio and the external flows volatility respectively, after controlling for all the 
other factors (GDP, inflation, volatility, etc.). The term t τ is capturing differences in sovereign rating across time not explained by the other determinants. In this model, we are mainly interested in the variables that can be affected by the flow of 
remittances, particularly the volatility indicator (i.e. the volatility of inward external flows) and 
the solvency ratio (i.e. the debt to exports ratio). 10 Tables 4a and 4b show the results for our 
general model and the three rating agencies. We run OLS and fixed-effect panel data regressions, 
the sovereign rating of the three agencies being the dependent variable and the volatility 
indicator and the solvency ratio, including and excluding remittances, being two of the many 
independent variables used. 11 10 As for the case of the models presented above, we build an artificial ratio by subtracting the total 
amount of Workers' Remittances from the variable Total Exports, and we name it 
wr 
TDX _ , this is, the debt to exports ratio excluding workers' remittances. Again, the coefficients for the variable Total 
Debt/Exports with and without remittances are very similar. By the same, in order to analyse the 
impact of remittances through the volatility of external flows, we subtract Workers' Remittances to the 
calculation of the volatility of external flows, and we name it wr 
indicator 
Volat 
_ 
_ , this is, the volatility of external flows by excluding workers' remittances. A coefficient test shows that they are not 
significantly different from the previous regression. 
11 A complementary approach consisted in defining a variable taking the difference between the two 
solvency ratios and volatilities of external flows, this is: 

only the results for the fixed effect estimation with time effect. First, we analyse the regressions 
including remittances in the volatility of external flows as well as in the solvency ratio. Not 
surprisingly, regressions (i), (iii) and (v) in Table 4b reveal that GDP per capita is positive and 
significant at the 1 per cent level. GDP growth, on the contrary, is not significant for our sample 
and is negatively correlated with ratings (the exception being for Moody's). A higher inflation is 
related to a lower rating but this result is only significant for S&P. The balance budget is negative 
and significant for Fitch. Although this result could be unexpected, it is not uncommon in the 
literature (Cantor and Packer 1996, Mora 2006), and revisits the debate on whether current 
account deficits display strengths or weaknesses the country's economic performance. As stated 
by Mora (2006), better rated countries are able to run current account deficits and borrow more 
easily from abroad; therefore a deficit could be seen as a sign of strength (regardless of whether it 
is because they are rated higher or whether the higher rating is correlated with factors that allow 
the country to run deficits). Both the debt to exports ratio and the external flows volatility 
variable are consistently negative and significant for all rating agencies. Indeed, additionally to 
the standard variable used to explain the impact of remittances on ratings (i.e. the solvency ratio), 
the new variable (i.e. the volatility indicator) helps to explain ratings. The variable default is 
negatively correlated to the sovereign rating, as expected, and is significant for S&P. The 
reserves-to-GDP ratio is positively related to S&P and Moody's ratings, highlighting the 
increasing role of precautionary reserves for impeding defaults. Regressions (ii), (iv) and (vi) 
consider the new variables excluding remittances from both the debt to exports ratio and the 
external flows volatility variable: they show very similar results. III.4. Counterfactual analysis for Latin America – General Model To assess the potential effect that the modified solvency ratio and modified volatility 
indicator could have on ratings for Latin American countries, we construct a simple 
counterfactual scenario, looking at the rating evolution when remittance flows are taken into 
account. We use the observed debt to exports ratio and the counterfactual debt to exports ratio 
that we estimated for the previous regressions, this is, excluding remittance flows (TDX_wr). By 
the same token, we use the observed volatility indicator and the counterfactual volatility 
indicator that we estimated for the previous regressions, this is, excluding remittance flows 
(volat_indicator_wr). We estimate our initial model with the counterfactual variable: 12 We check for the presence of multicollinearity in the general model by computing the variance inflation factors. The tolerance for all variables included in the model was close to 1, confirming the absence of 
collinearity between regressors. As a robustness check, we also estimate correlations between fixed effects 
and country ratings. We find a correlation of 0.25 for S&P, 0.30 for Moody's and 0.24 for Fitch, which is 
reasonably low. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 24 © OECD 2009 t

Then, we use the observed debt to exports ratio (TDX) as well as the external flows volatility variable (volat_indicator) and calculate the change in the rating using these both variables and the β ˆ coefficients. We obtain the potential improvement in the sovereign ratings for the Latin American countries included in the 
sample. Annexes 4a, 4b, and 4c depict i) the observed rating for S&P, Moody's and Fitch, respectively ( " Observed "  Y in the figures); ii) the predicted rating ( " Predicted "  Y ˆ in the figures) estimated taking into account the TDX_wr ratio (debt to exports ratio excluding remittances) and 
the volat_indicator_wr ratio (volatility of external flows excluding remittances); iii) the 
counterfactual rating in the scenario including workers' remittances in our variable of interests, debt/exports and volatility of external flows ( " Counterfactual "  Y 
~ in the figures). Figure 4 compares three types of ratings: the observed rating, the predicted rating 
(estimated from a model by excluding remittances from the solvency ratio and from the external 
flows volatility) and the counterfactual rating (calculated from the estimators of the predicted 
model and by including remittances in the two core explanatory variables: solvency ratio and 
volatility of external flows). Figure 4. Observed, Predicted and Counterfactual Ratings in 2006 Standard and Poor's -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 El Salvador

For instance, by analysing the case of S&P, we note that for countries with high levels of 
remittances over GDP (e.g., El Salvador, Guatemala, Ecuador and Dominican Republic), there is 
a relative high difference between the predicted rating and the counterfactual rating, showing 
that by including remittances, estimated ratings can improve for these countries. For the case of 
El Salvador, estimated rating can improve close to one notch when remittances are included. 
However, a question remains: are CRAs already including remittances in their own models? By 
comparing the counterfactual rating and the observed rating, these ratings do not change 
considerably for countries with high levels of remittances over GDP. Indeed, for other countries, Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 26 © OECD 2009 like Uruguay or Venezuela, changes are substantially more important. Moreover, for the set of 
countries with high levels of remittances, it is not clear that the observed rating is less favourable 
than the counterfactual rating (positive sign in the figure). For the case of El Salvador and 
Guatemala, observed ratings are more favourable than the counterfactual rating, meaning that 
Standard and Poor's ratings are more favourable than those yielded in a statistical model 
including remittances. By contrast, for Ecuador and Dominican Republic, the inverse case is 
found: the statistical model with remittances is more favourable than Standard and Poor's. Including the debt to exports ratio and the volatility of external flows in the estimation 
does not substantially alter the results. We infer that including remittances in the rating agencies' 
model does not improve most Latin American countries' ratings. To check the robustness of this 
result, we test the opposite estimation, using the variables TDX and Volat_indicator as follows: t

= and doing the counterfactual with the variable excluding remittances (TDX_wr). These results 
are very similar to those presented in Annex 4. 13 III.5. Model for High-Remittance Receptors Sovereign ratings are the output of a qualitative and quantitative analysis of credit risk. 
They are generally assigned on a case-by-case basis. This is in line with previous research (e.g. 
Roubini and Manasse, 2005) showing that there is not a single model to rate countries, which 
implies that not all variables have the same impact on ratings. In that context, the wide range of countries in the sample does not permit to fully isolate 
the impact of remittances. Initially, we would expect that for those countries where remittances 
have a non-negligible weight in the economy (as a share of GDP), the change in our two 
benchmark variables (i.e. solvency ratio and volatility indicator) including and excluding 
remittances would be significant. For this reason, we calculate a threshold variable (for each 
country and year) taking the value 1 when the ratio Remittances/GDP is higher than a given 
threshold and zero otherwise. The objective is to identify those countries and years where 
remittances are more important. Note that this dummy is non constant over time, and therefore 
can be included in the fixed-effect panel. Then, we calculate a crossed term with the non-constant 
dummy and the variables TDX and Volat_indicator, that will detect the interaction effect between 
countries with a high share of remittances and our variable of interest. 14 13 These results are not reported but they can be provided upon request. 
14 We tested other configurations to take into account the importance of isolating those ratings most 
likely to be affected by remittance flows. We included the remittances to GDP ratio as an explanatory 
variable, but this was not significant for the sample. Also, we split the sample into different groups, OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 27 Thus, we test the following model for the whole sample: t

Threshold: 5.0% Source: Authors' calculation. following the World Bank classification (lower income/middle income/higher income, etc.) and 
performed regressions on each group. Finally, we opted for the non-constant dummy variable. 
15 We test for the robustness of the estimation by running a pooled regression with all observations, 
should the individual effects affect the estimation. We find that for both specifications (general and 
threshold model), the solvency ratio and the volatility of external flows are consistently significant 
and negative. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 28 © OECD 2009 Regressions in Table 5 allow isolating the effect that remittances can have for those 
countries where they are more important. With the 3.5 per cent threshold, the dummy variable is 
significant for two agencies. The interactive term for the volatility of external flows, also, is 
positive and significant. Increasing the threshold to 5 per cent does have a significant and 
positive effect on the dummy variable for S&P only. It does affect the interactive variable, with a 
positive and significant effect on the sovereign rating (S&P and Moody's). By contrast, the 
interactive dummy variable of the solvency ratio is not significant. 16 This result suggests that for remittance-dependent countries, high remittances do not 
have necessarily a direct effect on ratings (the dummy variable remittances over GDP is 
significant for some agencies and dependent on the threshold used). If a country is highly 
dependent on remittances, this does not automatically mean that markets' perception about this 
country is going to improve. However, the solvency ratio and the external flows volatility variable (by including 
remittances) are significant for most of the CRAs. Moreover, the interaction term between the 
remittances to GDP ratio and the flows volatility is significant to explain ratings, denoting that 
the negative impact of the volatility of external flows on ratings is reduced. In other words, 
remittances have above all an indirect and positive impact on ratings through a premium 
(captured with the interactive dummy variable remittances over GDP and the volatility of 
external flows). Indeed, there is an insight. The indirect impact of remittances on ratings goes 
mainly through the volatility of external flows (and not through the solvency ratio, as argued in 
previous research on sovereign ratings and remittances). For countries where the remittances to GDP ratio is higher than 5 per cent, the elasticity 
of the rating with respect to the external flows variable is 12 
9 β 
β + . Since 12 β is positive, the weight of the external flows variable is reduced. We find that including an interaction term 
between the remittances to GDP ratio and the external flows variable denotes a more inelastic 
rating for those countries where precisely remittances are more important. For countries with 
high remittances to GDP ratio, there is an indirect effect of remittances. Besides, the negative 
impact of the volatility of external flows on their ratings can be attenuated. In any case, as it is 
depicted in Annex 5, the effect is somehow limited. Results support the view that CRAs do take remittance flows into account to rate 
sovereigns. This variable turns out to be significant for a limited set of countries, specifically 
those that are small in size and classified in the low and middle income categories. A favourable 
trend of remittances can improve ratings but the reverse scenario also applies. Such findings 
explain why in the current economic crisis, five out of the seven rated countries with the highest 
remittances to GDP ratios in the region have been downgraded or have faced a worsening of 
their rating outlook (from positive to stable or from stable to negative). 17 16 For the threshold model, we also estimate correlations between fixed effects and country ratings. The 
correlation with S&P is -0.01, 0.28 for Moody's and 0.24 for Fitch. These low correlations allow us to 
believe that estimation and prediction do not depend solely on the countries' fixed effect. 
17 Since September 2008, Jamaica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador have been 
downgraded and/or their outlooks have worsened. The two countries with stable ratings are OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 29 However, the impact of including remittances in both the solvency ratio and the external 
flows volatility ratio remains weak with respect to other fundamental variables that affect 
ratings. This suggests that other factors, such as the reduction of debt service, the lowering of the 
foreign currency debt and the deepening of local currency financial markets may be more 
relevant to explain ratings. III.6. Shadow ratings for unrated countries by CRAs The credit rating issued by major international rating agencies is a key aspect affecting a 
sovereign's access to capital markets. Even if sovereign bonds do not always need ratings to be 
placed in the international capital markets, it is common practice to have them rated, given the 
necessity of institutional investors to have a benchmark for credit risk. Indeed, while their 
participation is not strictly needed in a legal sense, domestic or international prudential 
regulations, which rely on ratings and place limits on the purchase of unrated securities, make 
them necessary in practice. 18 This is even more important today than in the past because other 
capital markets' signals about credit risk that existed in the past are no longer valid today 
(Flandreau, Flores, Gaillard and Nieto, 2009). Moreover, sovereign ratings generate externalities. First, they might help to draw more 
investors' attention and therefore attract more capital flows. Sovereign ratings can be considered 
a benchmark for investors' decisions in private bond and equity markets as well as in foreign 
direct investment. Second, sovereign ratings are often the ceiling for sub-sovereign as well as 
corporate foreign currency ratings. Somewhat surprisingly, given the benefits of a rating, a large number of developing 
countries remain unrated today. High fixed costs, lack of information and of incentives may be 
responsible for this. According to Ratha, De and Mohapatra (2007),  " 70 developing countries – 
mostly poor – and 12 high-income countries do not have a rating from a major rating agency. Of 
the 86 developing countries that have been rated, the rating was established in 2004 or earlier for 
15 countries " . Similar results are found for the coverage made by investment banks in their 
reports to developing and emerging countries (Nieto-Parra and Santiso, 2007). 19 What would be the  " shadow ratings "  for unrated Latin American and Caribbean 
countries? Table 6 presents two series of periods covering shadow and potential ratings Honduras and Nicaragua. Guyana and Haiti are not taking into account given they do not have 
ratings. 
18 Moreover, the Basel II regulatory framework could penalize unrated securities (Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision, 2005). 19 Country coverage by leading investment banks and leading emerging-market benchmarks like the 
EMBI produced by JP Morgan for the bond markets or leading global banks like Citigroup, Deutsche 
Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley, rarely cover or sample more than 35 economies. The 
other 120 developing countries simply do not exist for global financial-market investors. Only 10 
countries enjoyed systematic coverage from the major financial institutions. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 30 © OECD 2009 respectively for each country and agency. 20 The naming  " shadow ratings "  concerns unrated 
countries for a given year and a specific agency, while  " potential ratings "  refer to countries that 
were already assigned a rating by a specific agency for a given year. Table 6. Shadow and Potential Ratings by CRA and by Country "Shadow ratings"

2003:2006 Note: This table presets the periods covering shadow ratings for the general model. Periods covering Shadow 
ratings for unrated and highly dependent countries are exhibited in Annex 6. Source: The authors based on Fitch (2008a), Moody's (2008a) and S&P (2007). In Annex 4,  " shadow "  and  " potential "  ratings are calculated for the general model. 21 As 
we noted before, CRAs do not have a unique model to assign ratings. Therefore, we calculate as 
well  " shadow ratings "  for unrated and highly dependent countries (see Annex 5). In particular, 
shadow ratings are estimated for Latin American and Caribbean countries which are highly 
dependent on remittances (i.e. Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Dominican 20 Shadow ratings were reassessed including the fixed effect independently. The reassessed ratings for 
S&P were: Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala. For 
Moody's: Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru. For 
Fitch: Bolivia, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Panama. 
21 More precisely,  " shadow "  and  " potential "  ratings are considered equally as  " predicted ratings "  and 
compared with the counterfactual ratings. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 31 Republic and Ecuador) according to a specific model. For instance, the shadow ratings of Fitch 
for Honduras and Nicaragua are B-and CCC+ respectively, while the shadow ratings of S&P for 
these both countries are B. As pointed by Nieto-Parra and Santiso (2007), a partnership agreement could be reached 
between a leading international organisation, supported by donor agencies, and a  " market 
maker "  in emerging markets, in order to boost country coverage. Experiences of public-private 
partnerships have already been implemented in order to improve country coverage. For some 
years now, Standard & Poor's, one of the leading rating agencies, has provided coverage for 
African sovereigns, with the support of UNDP (United Nations Development Programme). In 
2006, 14 sovereigns were rated. Likewise, aiming to improve the region's economic coverage, the 
OECD Development Centre and the African Development Bank launched the African Economic 
Outlook in 2001. By providing a number of indicators (on macroeconomic performance but also 
aid flows, exports, public finances, FDI, poverty, income distribution, employment, trade 
diversification, civil tensions and health, among others) and country-level analysis, the report 
provides key economic, financial and political factors to determine sovereign ratings in the 
region. A potential partnership can facilitate the understanding of the benefits of ratings to 
interested governments and encourage their request. Are Workers' Remittances Relevant for Credit Rating Agencies? DEV/DOC(2009)7 32 © OECD 2009 IV. CONCLUSION This paper analyses the impact of remittance flows on sovereign ratings for developing 
and emerging countries over the period 1993-2006. Our hypothesis is that they may have served 
to significantly reduce country risk for smaller economies. In order to capture the impact of 
remittances on sovereign risk, we focus on two core variables. We test a traditional solvency 
ratio, already used in the literature and we introduce another determinant, the volatility of 
external flows. First, using a model of the determinants of sovereign ratings and then a counterfactual 
estimation, we find that the impact of including remittances in both the solvency ratio and the 
external flows volatility on ratings is modest. This suggests that other factors, such as the 
reduction of debt service, the lowering of the foreign currency debt and the deepening of local 
currency financial markets may be more relevant to explain ratings. Second, there is no single model to rate countries and variables highlighted by agencies 
do not have the same impact on sovereign ratings. 22 In that context we estimated a specific model 
for countries with relatively high levels of remittances. Our results support the view that 
remittance flows have an influence on small low and middle income Central American and 
Caribbean countries. This impact of remittances depends more on the volatility of external flows 
than on the solvency ratio (debt over exports). Nevertheless, the recent wave of downgrades of 
several remittance-dependent countries due to the drop in remittances may suggest that those 
have procyclical effects in times of market turmoil (five out of the seven rated countries with the 
highest remittances to GDP ratios have been downgraded or have faced a worsening of their 
rating outlook since September 2008). Third, this research also provides shadow ratings for countries which are not rated by the 
three main CRAs, in particular some Central American and Caribbean countries, where relative 
remittance flows are high. Our analysis provides useful information on the potential ratings of 
these countries, thus indicating their creditworthiness to international investors. In that context, a 
public-private partnership could be reached in order to boost country coverage. Such initiatives 
are not without precedent: for some years Standard & Poor's has provided rating coverage of 
some African sovereigns with support from the United Nations Development Programme. 
Additionally, other types of partnership can also be envisaged at the inter-governmental level, 
involving public officials with an interest in these regions. Public donors both from OECD and 
non-OECD countries, gathered at the Development Centre, may be interested to deploy an 
initiative for sovereign rating's coverage, as a way to enhance countries' financial visibility and 
encourage cooperation. 22 This goes in line with previous research (Roubini and Manasse, 2005). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 282 DEV/DOC(2009)7 © OECD 2009 33 ANNEXES Annex 1
