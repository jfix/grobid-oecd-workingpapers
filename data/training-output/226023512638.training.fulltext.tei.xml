			<head>1. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Economic globalisation is currently characterised not only by increasing international trade in final<lb/> goods but also by increasing trade in intermediate goods and service transactions, as innovation and<lb/> production processes are fragmented across countries. The structure of such trends can be tracked by<lb/> carefully constructed multi-national input-output (I-O) tables. To do so, researchers link standardised (or<lb/> harmonised) national I-O tables to international bilateral trade matrices using standard assumptions (see<lb/> Box 1). In recent years, the OECD has undertaken efforts to improve and increase the coverage of its<lb/> database of harmonised I-O tables, not least to incorporate major non-OECD countries such as Brazil,<lb/> China, India, Indonesia and Russia (<ref type="biblio">Yamano and Ahmad, 2006</ref>). A useful feature of the OECD I-O tables<lb/> is that intermediate inputs are divided into goods and services that are domestically-produced and those<lb/> that are imported. To extend the analytical power of this data set, OECD is embarking on a project to<lb/> develop bilateral trade matrices that can help identify the country of origin of imported intermediate inputs<lb/> and be used to link I-O tables. However, this requires analyses of currently available international bilateral<lb/> trade data to identify areas where adjustments may be required to best match the estimates of exports and<lb/> imports in I-O tables.<lb/> This paper discusses the challenges faced when attempting to construct consistent bilateral trade<lb/> matrices using the widely used annual databases of international trade hosted by the OECD and United<lb/> Nations Statistical Division (UNSD) 1 as well as national sources. While the focus is on identifying and<lb/> measuring re-exported goods, other reasons for inconsistencies in so-called mirror trade are discussed, as<lb/> is the issue of identifying internationally traded goods that were not manufactured recently (for example<lb/> secondhand goods, scrap metal and other waste products). The additional problems faced when attempting<lb/> to convert trade data from product classifications to industry classification are also addressed – not least<lb/> identifying imported intermediate products. While the discussion mainly concerns international trade in<lb/> goods, one cannot ignore the issues concerning measurement of international trade in services and the<lb/> related methodological requirements for compiling Balance of Payments (BOP) accounts. National<lb/> Supply-Use tables (SUTs) and I-O tables are constructed within the framework of National Accounts<lb/> (according to SNA93 2 or, in EU, ESA95 recommendations) which use BOP definitions for aggregate<lb/> international trade data. Ultimately, to link national harmonised I-O tables, matrices with &quot; adjusted &quot;<lb/> bilateral trade data for both goods and services are required. Discussion of certain types of international<lb/> trade in services such as Foreign Affiliates Trade in Services (FATS) data is not included here but can be<lb/> found in separate studies such as <ref type="biblio">Bensidoun</ref> and Ünal-Kesenci (2008) 3 .<lb/> 1.<lb/> For trade in goods, OECD&apos;s International Trade in Commodity Statistics (ITCS) and U.N.&apos;s Comtrade<lb/> database.<lb/> 2.<lb/> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/sna1993/toctop.asp.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) recognises four modes of provision of trade in<lb/> services. BOP covers modes 1 and 2 (Cross-border supply and Consumption abroad) while FATS mainly<lb/> covers mode 3 (Commercial presence). Mode 4 (Presence of natural persons) can be found in both BOP<lb/> and FATS.<lb/></table>

			<head>Box 1. Using inter-regional trade matrices in input-output systems<lb/></head>

			<p>In general, to measure economic interactions between regions, there are two different types of input-output<lb/> systems that can take account of trade flows: inter-regional input-output (IRIO) and multi-regional input-output (MRIO).<lb/> For IRIO, suppose that an inter-regional trade flow can be expressed as<lb/> -i.e. the value of intermediate<lb/> goods from industry i in region h purchased by industry j in region m; that<lb/> is the total output of industry j in<lb/> region m; that<lb/> is the final demand of output from industry j in region m by region h (for private or<lb/> government consumption or investment); and that N and R represent the number of industries and regions,<lb/> respectively; then in IRIO, the total output of industry j in region m can be written as:<lb/></p>

			<p>where<lb/> =<lb/> are the input coefficients. In IRIO, the data requirements are substantial as consistent matrices<lb/> of inter-regional, inter-industry trade are required.<lb/> Alternatively, in MRIO some assumptions are made in order to build matrices with reduced data requirements.<lb/> Notably, it uses transactions data where the sector of destination is ignored. Rather than using trade flows between<lb/> industries i and j, MRIO requires<lb/> : the value of goods from industry i that region m ships from region h. This<lb/> yields the proportion of goods from industry i in region m shipped from other regions, also known as the trade<lb/> coefficient of region m of goods from industry i and expressed as<lb/> with<lb/> =1. With each<lb/> region&apos;s input coefficient<lb/> (<lb/></p>

				<formula>, m = 1, 2, …, R)</formula>

			<p>available, then in the MRIO system, the inter-regional flow<lb/> can be expressed as:<lb/></p>

			<p>Note that<lb/> is the total final demand of output from industry j in region m.<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: <ref type="biblio">Isard et al. (1998, Chapter 3)<lb/></ref> For measuring trade flows among the 40 or so countries targeted in the OECD I-O database, the trade coefficient<lb/> matrix can be estimated using OECD&apos;s STAN Bilateral Trade by industry Database (BTD) for member countries and<lb/> for non-member countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN GOODS: STATISTICAL ISSUES AND DATA ISSUES<lb/> 2.1. Origins of problems with &quot; mirror statistics &quot; – an overview<lb/></head>

			<p>Trade is the activity of buying, selling, or exchanging goods or services within a country or between<lb/> countries. In this paper we concentrate on international trade between countries. Statistically, international<lb/> merchandise trade in goods measures physical movements of goods across international frontiers. In<lb/> Balance of Payments, BPM5 definitions, international trade should be recorded when there has been a<lb/> change of ownership of goods between a resident and non-resident.<lb/></p>

			<p>When conducting analyses of trade flows between countries or regions, it is highly desirable that<lb/> merchandise trade data recorded by country A for exports to country B match data recorded by country B<lb/> for imports from country A in order to produce consistent A-B trade flow matrices by year (and by<lb/> commodity groups). Unfortunately this is rarely the case. Problems with &quot; mirror statistics &quot; occur for many<lb/> reasons, including:<lb/> • different valuations for imports (c.i.f.) and exports (f.o.b.) 4 ;<lb/> • different trade recording systems for imports and exports, general v. special trade 4 ;<lb/> • differences across countries in definitions of trade partners;<lb/> • differences in thresholds for recording international trade 5 which by extension means differences<lb/> in definition of trade in &quot; small transactions &quot; ;<lb/> • consequences of &quot; merchanting &quot; ; and<lb/> • others, such as timing of measurement (recording by customs), differing allocation of product<lb/> classification to goods or mis-attribution; and smuggling (<ref type="biblio">Tsigas et al.1992</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>At an aggregate level, in the context of National Accounts and Balance of Payments (BoP),<lb/> adjustments are made to merchandise trade in goods to produce more consistent estimates. For example,<lb/> valuation adjustments for imports (i.e. costs of insurance and freight are deducted from imports of goods<lb/> and added to imports of services), adjustments due to timing (i.e. when time of change in ownership does<lb/> not coincide with movement of goods), and adjustments when there has been a change in ownership but<lb/> the goods have not crossed the customs frontier (for example, large value capital items such as ships and<lb/> aircraft). However, few national authorities make such BoP adjustments at more detailed levels – either by<lb/> partner country or by commodity (even for relatively aggregate levels). Also, while the United Nations<lb/> (1998) provides clear recommendations on defining trade partners, practices may differ across countries<lb/> when compiling trade statistics. Close attention needs to be paid to national definitions when looking at<lb/> trade statistics.<lb/> For analyses of the impact of globalisation, linking harmonised I-O tables with consistent trade<lb/> matrices can provide a range of interesting insights (inter-dependencies etc.). While the general problems<lb/> 4 .<lb/> For definitions of different trade systems, c.i.f. and f.o.b., please refer to <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<table>.<lb/> 5.<lb/> In the EU, external trade statistics apply a transaction threshold system. Transactions below a certain value<lb/> or quantity do not have to be reported by Member States. For extra-EU trade this threshold is currently<lb/> EUR 1 000 or 1 000 kg in net mass. For intra-EU trade statistics the threshold is EUR 200.<lb/> (see: http://europa.eu.int/estatref/info/sdds/en/ext/ext_sm.htm). Note that the EU Intrastat system is the<lb/> main reason for differences in trade statistics published by OECD/UN and EU (see Lindner, 2008).<lb/> connected with mirror statistics need to be addressed, an increasingly significant problem across an<lb/> increasing number of countries is the presence of &quot; re-exports &quot; in recorded trade statistics. Indeed it is a<lb/> major reason for the existing discrepancies between international trade data reported by importers and<lb/> exporters.<lb/></table>

			<head>2.2. Re-exports<lb/></head>

			<p>According to the UN definition of general trade flows (<ref type="biblio">United Nations, 1998</ref>), re-exports take place<lb/> when goods enter a customs territory from one country and are shipped to another country without being<lb/> transformed 6 . It is also known as transhipment (see <ref type="biblio">Mellens et al., 2007, Andriamananjara et al., 2004,<lb/> Fung and Lau, 1998</ref>). Although rarely recorded separately in published national or international databases,<lb/> re-exports can sometimes be distinguished from other trade flows as demonstrated by <ref type="biblio">Roos (2005, 2006</ref>) in<lb/> the case of the Netherlands (where re-exports now account for over 40% of recorded exports).<lb/> The presence of re-exports is most likely in those countries and regions with favourable geographical<lb/> positions from a perspective of intercontinental transportation. These include the Netherlands, Belgium,<lb/> Germany, and possibly France in Europe, and Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia, in the sense that these<lb/> countries act as the hubs for shipments of trade between countries of their continental region and the rest of<lb/> the world. For example, major hub functions between the European economy and the rest of the world are<lb/> located at Dutch and Belgian ports while the ports of Hong Kong play a similar role for eastern Asia. In<lb/> this context it should be noted that over 80% of the world&apos;s trade in goods is transported by sea (UNCTAD,<lb/> 2008).<lb/> When coupled with differences across countries in definitions of country of origin and country of<lb/> consignment for import partners, re-exports (and re-imports) can significantly increase export/import<lb/> discrepancies between countries. For example, if China exports USD 5 million worth of<lb/> domestically-produced goods to the US via Hong Kong, then effectively China exports USD 5 million<lb/> worth of domestically-produced goods to Hong Kong and Hong Kong re-exports the same amount to the<lb/> US (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. An example of flows of goods in three countries/regions<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, depending on how the transaction is recorded by each country, discrepancies in trade data<lb/> may or may not arise. Taking the above example whereby China exports domestically-produced goods to<lb/> the U.S. via Hong Kong, from the perspective of Hong Kong, imports from China are recorded as<lb/> re-exports to the U.S. as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. However, for both China and the U.S., data compilers may<lb/> record the transaction differently depending on the information available to them. Both countries follow<lb/> the recommendations of the United Nations (1998) to define their trading partners, as country of origin for<lb/> imports and last known destination for exports. However, the US also accepts the country of shipment as<lb/> an import partner country if the country of origin could not be identified. Note that, the last known<lb/> destination also limits the information known at the time of exports as specified by the UN (1998).<lb/> Therefore, there are potentially four different combinations recording the 5-million-dollar trade transaction:<lb/> 1. China knows the last known destination of the exported goods is the U.S., and the U.S. identifies the origin<lb/> of the goods as China;<lb/></p>

			<p>2. China knows the last known destination of the exported goods is the U.S., however, the U.S. cannot<lb/> identify the origin of the imports, but can only track that it is shipped from Hong Kong;<lb/></p>

			<p>3. China only knows the exports go to Hong Kong 7 , no further information of future destination is available,<lb/> but somehow, the U.S. knows the origin of their imports are from China; and<lb/> 4. China only knows the exports go to Hong Kong, no further information of future destination is available;<lb/> the U.S. cannot track the origin of the import but only the shipment region, Hong Kong.<lb/></p>

			<p>The different recordings are also illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In fact, this example reflects the reality of the<lb/> long-existing and controversial trade discrepancies between China and the U.S. as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/></p>

Despite efforts made since 1993, China still cannot fully<lb/> track the final destination of the goods exported to Hong Kong. See also He (2007).<lb/></table>

			<p>Note that this example does not deal with the possibility of mark-ups in Hong Kong (via branding,<lb/> re-packaging etc.) before the goods are shipped to the U.S. so that, for example, the USD 50 million worth<lb/> of goods shipped from China to Hong Kong become USD 60 million worth of goods imported by the USA.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.1. Re-exports – a growing phenomenon<lb/></head>

			<p>As liberalisation of global trade increases, more countries, particularly those with a special trade<lb/> status or geographical location (such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Hong Kong and Singapore), are paying<lb/> more attention to their trade flows as domestically-produced goods account for less of the total volume of<lb/> trade with their partner countries. As a result, increasing asymmetries in trade statistics with their partner<lb/> countries are becoming apparent (Geyer-Schaefer 2007). The classic case is the trade discrepancy between<lb/> China and the U.S. where re-exports from Hong Kong account for a very large share (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In the<lb/> case of the Netherlands, the trend of increasing re-exports started in the mid-80s, and has continued since<lb/> then. Currently, re-exports account for more than 40% of the total exports in the country compared to less<lb/> than 20% in 1990 (<ref type="biblio">Mellens et al., 2007; Kusters and Verbruggen, 2001</ref>). Increasing re-exports is a<lb/> worldwide trend, affecting not only Hong Kong and the Netherlands but countries such as Singapore and<lb/> Germany. For Hong Kong the average growth rate of re-exports was about 18% from 1983 to 2005, while<lb/> for the Netherlands it was about 9% between 1985 and 1997, and for Germany the annual growth in<lb/> re-exports from 1992 to 2002 was about 14%. Estimates of re-exports as a share of total exports varies<lb/> across countries – in Germany it is about 15%, in Singapore, more that 50%, while in Hong Kong, it is<lb/> around 95% (<ref type="biblio">Mellens et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Table 2. Re-exports through Hong Kong (USD billion)<lb/> Source: Fung and Lau (2003) <ref type="table">Table 2.<lb/></ref> As mentioned earlier, UN (1998) considers re-exports to be foreign goods exported from any part of<lb/> the economic territory of a country in the same state 8 as previously imported 9 . However, in practice,<lb/> countries have different ways to define and account for re-exports and consequently different methods for<lb/> refining trade flow data. In the Netherlands, for example, re-exports are imported goods leaving the<lb/> Netherlands in a largely unprocessed state. That is, a Dutch trader may buy goods in the United States,<lb/> store them in his own warehouse searching for a buyer, and then export them to Germany. There are three<lb/> different ways to define the re-exports, which are (1) based on the origin criteria, (2) based on the rule of<lb/> 8.<lb/> The term &quot; goods in the same state &quot; includes goods which underwent processing that did not change their<lb/> origin. Re-packing, splitting into lots, sorting or grading, marking and the like are not considered as<lb/> undergoing a process of transformation of a good.<lb/></p>

A distinction also has to be made for other types of flows such<lb/> as transit and quasi transit via a custom warehouse or through the Netherlands (Roos, 2005).<lb/></table>

			<head>2.2.2. Re-exports – methodological issues<lb/></head>

			<p>Roos (2005) presented some ways to identify and measure re-exports in the Netherlands. In practice,<lb/> companies in the Netherlands have to provide Statistics Netherlands with a code to specify the trade flow<lb/> in order to distinguish re-exports from domestic exports. In practice, not every company provides the<lb/> correct code and as a result only one-third of what is assumed to be re-exports are reported in this way.<lb/> Re-exports can be estimated by using the information in the supply-and-use tables of National<lb/> Accounts. This method can provide estimates at a reasonably detailed level of products and was applied to<lb/> estimate re-exports of the Netherlands in the nineties (<ref type="biblio">Roos, 2006</ref>). However, it has the drawback of only<lb/> providing data at the total world level i.e. without additional information by partner country. Another way<lb/> of identifying re-exports is to compare the volume of imports to the volume of exports of the company. If<lb/> measured imports are more or less equal to exports for the same product code, then the exports are<lb/> probably re-exports, while if measured exports are notably higher than imports, then there is some<lb/> domestic production. Usually the largest exporters are profiled to enhance the estimations. Note that some<lb/> other factors, such as production structure, can be taken into account of estimating re-exports. For example,<lb/> if certain goods are not produced or grown in a country (e.g. bananas), then all exports of such goods can<lb/> be considered re-exports (<ref type="biblio">Roos, 2006</ref>).<lb/> In New Zealand re-exports are defined as &quot; merchandise exports that were earlier imported into<lb/> New Zealand and comprise less than 50 percent New Zealand content by value. &quot; New Zealand has adopted<lb/> a value-added-based assessment to determine whether a &quot; transformation &quot; of a good is &quot; substantial &quot; , which<lb/> is called &quot; 50 percent New Zealand content by value &quot; . Actually, it is a simplified definition, referring to the<lb/> exact rules of origin in the Customs and Excise Regulations that govern whether a good is of domestic or<lb/> foreign origin. In detail, the &quot; 50 percent rule of origin &quot; is calculated as:<lb/></p>

			<head>Qualifying Expenditure (QE)<lb/> Factory Cost (FC)<lb/></head>

			<p>which is expressed as a percentage, where qualifying expenditure (QE) are domestic expenditure on<lb/> materials, labour &amp; overheads, while Factory Cost (FC) are the total expenditure on materials, labour and<lb/> overheads, including (1) the purchase price, (2) overseas freight and insurance, (3) port and clearance<lb/> charges, and (4) inward transport to store, but not (1) customs duty, (2) anti-dumping duty, (3) excise duty,<lb/> and (4) sales &amp; goods and services taxes. In March 2004, New Zealand implemented an electronic system<lb/> for tracing the origin of a good being exported through New Zealand customs. This allows the timely<lb/> transfer of monthly export statistics to Statistics New Zealand so that re-export statistics can be compiled<lb/> along with the total exports statistics 10 . Note that trade statistics in New Zealand are compiled at a detailed,<lb/> 10-digit, level of the Harmonised System.<lb/> In Hong Kong, more than 90% of merchandise trade is due to re-exports (re-imports) mainly<lb/> involving China. This high-profile case of re-exports has been recognised by many researchers in recent<lb/> years with much effort going into making necessary adjustments to trade statistics prior to analyses. For<lb/> example, in the series of analyses by Fung and Lau since 1998, they have used the trade data from China,<lb/> the US and Hong Kong to re-adjust the data on bilateral trade between the US and</p>

			<table>China by taking into<lb/> account different aspects of the issues which could cause discrepancies, such as estimates of re-exports by<lb/> 10.<lb/> For more detail, see Statistics New Zealand (2006).<lb/> DSTI/DOC(2009)4<lb/> Hong Kong not previously covered (1998), the measurement of exports and imports 11 ; smuggling, mark-up<lb/> rate and trade in services (2001, 2003) – adjusting the data covering the period from 1998 to 2002.<lb/> Recently Ferrantino and Wang (2007) tried to explore reasons for discrepancies by establishing a<lb/> regression model.<lb/> Further, Noda (1997) and Feenstra et al. (2005)</table>

			<p>provide some methods to build trade matrices by<lb/> using more extensive trade statistics. For example, Noda (1997) constructed a Hong Kong re-export trade<lb/> matrix by using detailed re-exports statistics from 1988 to 1995. If the re-export value of a certain<lb/> commodity from original country A i to trading partner A j via Hong Kong is designated as e ij , then the total<lb/> re-exporting value of this commodity to trading partner A j from different origin countries via Hong Kong,<lb/></p>

			<figure>ReX j , can be expressed as Re X j = e ij<lb/> i=1<lb/> m<lb/> ∑ , where m is the number of originating countries. Note that<lb/> Hong Kong merchandise trade statistics are compiled at the 8-digit level of HS.<lb/> Feenstra et al. (2005), on the other hand, adjusted the trade flows between China/Hong Kong and<lb/> other countries by taking into account the re-exports between China and Hong Kong. Their starting point is<lb/> to consider the value-added generated in Hong Kong when the re-exports occur. Different mark-up rates<lb/> are applied to different destination countries based on 1-digit SITC level according to the availability of<lb/> trade statistics for Chinese exports to Hong Kong and the Hong Kong re-exports of the same commodities.<lb/> That is, the mark-up of the value added is calculated by multiplying the mark-up rate to the value of<lb/> Chinese re-exports through Hong Kong to the destination countries. However, in order to avoid the<lb/> situation in which the Hong Kong re-export value added is higher than the import value from China as<lb/> reported in UN trade statistics, the value added of Hong Kong is re-defined as:<lb/> HK VA = Mark-up rate × min {UN country imports from China, China re-exports to UN country}<lb/> Note that the import statistics from China reported by the UN are at the 4-digit level of SITC. For<lb/> each country in the UN dataset, the value of imports from China is reduced by the calculated HK VA, while<lb/> the value of imports from Hong Kong is increased by the calculated HK VA.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 12 makes adjustments for re-exports for Hong Kong and<lb/> Netherlands in its GTAP 6 database. For Hong Kong, it also recognises that there is a re-export margin<lb/> included in re-exports which should be considered as value added by services and allocated accordingly.<lb/></p>

			<table>11.<lb/> Such as the different valuations of exports and imports used by the US and China. Exports are measured by<lb/> China as free on board (f.o.b.) while for the US the valuation is freight alongside ship (f.a.s.) – the<lb/> difference being the cost of loading the goods from alongside the vessel or aircraft onto the vessel or<lb/> aircraft. For import measurement, both countries use cost, insurance, and freight (c.i.f.). Note that to<lb/> convert f.a.s. value to f.o.b. value, 1% cost is added to the f.a.s. exports value (see Fung and Lau, 2003).<lb/> 12.<lb/> See www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=1819. Note that GTAP 7 (Nov<lb/> 2008) is now available (www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v7/default.asp) but at the time of writing,<lb/> updated documentation concerning GTAP treatment of trade data was not yet available.<lb/> Jin (2005) also provides an interesting discussion concentrating on &quot; processing trade &quot; and concludes:<lb/> &quot; Hong Kong&apos;s re-export of Chinese goods, in particular Chinese processing goods, is the major<lb/> reason for discrepancies in China&apos;s reported trade statistics with its major partners. The results<lb/> reflect changing economic reality rather than casting doubt on the quality of published trade data:<lb/> the real expansion of Chinese foreign trade in the last twenty years is due to the massive outsourcing<lb/> schemes of foreign invested enterprises into the low-margin processing sector in China. Despite the<lb/> decreasing trend in reliance on Hong Kong, the increasing scale of the processing trade means<lb/> large discrepancies will still exist in the future. &quot;<lb/></table>

			<head>2.2.3. Re-exports – availability of data<lb/></head>

			<p>Many countries, especially those using special trade systems, do not provide detailed information on<lb/> re-export statistics even though their exports figures routinely include re-exports. 13 As summarised in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, detailed re-exports data are currently only available in OECD ITCS and/or UN Comtrade for<lb/> New Zealand, the United States, Hong Kong, Russia and Singapore though not necessarily for all the years<lb/> covered by exports.<lb/> Re-exports data are available in the 2006 edition of OECD Input-Output database for most EU<lb/> countries (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<figure>for exceptions), Canada, Norway, Chinese Taipei, South Africa, Switzerland and<lb/> Turkey.<lb/> Note that in the OECD ITCS and UN Comtrade databases, data are sometimes reported where the<lb/> declaring country and partner country are identical (for example: Australian imports from Australia or<lb/> French exports to France). Such information is more prevalent for import data. While some of these data<lb/> can be attributed to re-imports or re-exports of goods, according to the available country notes in ITCS,<lb/> this is not always the case – see latest documentation for OECD&apos;s Bilateral Trade Database (OECD, 2008)<lb/> for more details.<lb/> 13.<lb/> See http://comtrade.un.org/kb/article.aspx?id=10152.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.3. Other data issues – an overview<lb/></head>

			<p>When linking I-O tables we need to have trade-in-goods matrices that are consistent with countries&apos;<lb/> data for domestic production and intermediate consumption and thus adjustments for re-exports (and<lb/> re-imports) are an obvious priority. I-O analytical tools, especially inter-regional and multi-regional I-O<lb/> models that link production structures across countries, are increasingly being used to address a wide range<lb/> of socio-economic and environmental issues such as embodied carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions (<ref type="biblio">Ahmad<lb/> and Wyckoff, 2003</ref>), international spatial organisation of the motor vehicle production (<ref type="biblio">Wixted, 2006</ref>), and<lb/> material and environmental flows measurement (<ref type="biblio">Wixted et al., 2006</ref>). If multinational I-O tables are not<lb/> well-constructed, subsequent analyses may be misleading.<lb/></p>

			<p>Besides re-exports, there are other issues related to international trade-in-goods data, which should be<lb/> considered when linking I-O tables. These include:<lb/> • &quot; Unallocated trade &quot; data: This is the trade that is not recorded in international databases under<lb/> regular (HS or SITC) product codes and/or not recorded by partner country, due to confidentiality<lb/> or other reasons. Such transactions may be recorded with special codes (e.g. HS 99 for products).<lb/> &quot; Unallocated trade &quot; as a share of total trade varies across countries and is often likely to be<lb/> concentrated in certain product groups or industries. The extent to which special codes are used<lb/> may even vary across time. In order to optimise trade data for linking input-output tables it would<lb/> be useful to have an idea of the underlying composition of any &quot; unallocated trade &quot; .<lb/> • Identification of trade in secondhand goods (e.g. transport equipment): These are not the result of<lb/> recent production and thus should not be linked to manufacturing production data for a given<lb/> year.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Identification of certain scrap and waste products for recycling or disposal (e.g. PCs).<lb/> • Identification of exports from the recycling industry: For example, distinguishing exports of<lb/> recycled metals or paper from exports of similar products manufactured from raw materials.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Consequences of &quot; merchanting &quot; : If a merchant in country A buys goods in country B and sells<lb/> them to country C, and the physical movement of goods is directly from B to C, then the value of<lb/> imports recorded by country C is usually greater than the value of exports recorded by country B<lb/> – the difference being recorded as a merchanting service credit in the Balance-of-Payments<lb/> account of country A. See <ref type="biblio">Takeda (2006)</ref> for detailed discussion.<lb/> • Differences in trade structures when comparing, within countries, merchandise trade statistics<lb/> found in ITCS or Comtrade with those given in official Supply-Use or I-O tables even when<lb/> allowing for the differences in definitions used for BoP and customs-based trade statistics.<lb/></p>

			<table>• Miscellaneous: For example, the significant impact of VAT intra-Community missing trader<lb/> fraud ( &quot; Carousel fraud &quot; ), as documented by the UK, affecting high-value low weight goods (such<lb/> as mobile phones). &quot; Official &quot; adjustments only made for total goods in a Balance of Payments<lb/> context – upward adjustments to imports of GBP 1.7 billion in 1999, GBP 2.8 billion<lb/> in<lb/> 2000,<lb/> GBP 7.1 billion in 2001 and GBP 11.1 billion in 2002.<lb/> See<lb/> www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?id=402. Also, under-reporting of Canadian<lb/> exports<lb/> to<lb/> non-US<lb/> destinations<lb/> as<lb/> documented<lb/> by<lb/> Statistics<lb/> Canada:<lb/> www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2008doc.nsf/linkTo/std-ses-wptgs(2008)5.<lb/></table>

			<p>Also, for certain trade data sources, such as UN Comtrade and OECD ITCS, there may be differences<lb/> in reported trade statistics for certain countries, by partner country as well as at total level.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.1. Difference of definitions in compiling trade statistics<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarises the different trade definitions and valuations used by the countries targeted in<lb/> OECD I-O tables. Even though the UN has recommendations for defining trade partners of each country,<lb/> different countries still have different definitions on import and export partner countries. Most countries on<lb/> our list consider the country of origin as their import partner and the last known destination as their export<lb/> partner. However, there are still some exceptions. For example, New Zealand and Hong Kong take the<lb/> country of consignment as the import partner. Some countries apply a second rule of defining partner<lb/> countries if the first rule cannot be met. For example, the US takes the country of shipment as the import<lb/> partner if the country of origin cannot be identified.<lb/> Two different trade systems are commonly used – the General Trade System and the Special Trade<lb/> System. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its<lb/> economic territory, while a special trade system is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a<lb/> particular part of the economic territory (<ref type="biblio">UN 1998</ref>). The general trade system is recommended by the UN<lb/> (1998) and used by most of the non-EU countries in our sample. In the EU, Special Trade is generally used,<lb/> the exceptions being Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. All European countries take countries of<lb/> consignment as export and import partners as far as intra-EU trade is concerned 14 . However, there are<lb/> exceptions. For example, Greece also takes the country of the first consignment as import partner country,<lb/> while Poland considers the countries of buyers as the import partner countries.<lb/> 14.<lb/> According to Eurostat, there are ten countries that use the country of origin as a criterion for their national<lb/> figures, but provide data to Eurostat on a country-of-consignment basis for intra-community trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.2. Unallocated trade data<lb/></head>

			<p>Unallocated trade refers to reported transactions not allocated to regular HS product codes, and/or not<lb/> allocated to a particular partner country, but reported using special codes (for example, HS 99 or<lb/> &quot; Commodities not specified according to kind &quot; for products; &quot; Other Areas n.e.s. &quot; for partners). The special<lb/> items cover confidential transactions as well as data that could not be allocated for other statistical reasons<lb/> (e.g. incomplete or ambiguous information on transactions). Such data cannot be ignored when linking the<lb/> trade data to I-O tables because unclassified goods in each country may be concentrated in certain<lb/> industries and/or related to certain partners. A maximum amount of information concerning the product,<lb/> and partner, composition of &quot; unallocated trade &quot; should be solicited from national authorities to make the<lb/> linkage of trade data to I-O tables more justified. On the other hand, if a country does not have unallocated<lb/> trade reported in databases it may be worth investigating whether the country really does not have<lb/> unallocated trade (confidential trade) or it is just not being reported. Note that GTAP also addresses this<lb/> issue when compiling GTAP database on the world economy as a system of flows of goods and services 15 .<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> summarises the percentage of trade in products not specified, in HS according to kind. On<lb/> average, OECD countries have higher shares than non-OECD countries for both exports and imports. The<lb/> situation varies from country to country. Some countries such as Germany, Ireland, Russia, United<lb/> Kingdom and United States have relatively high shares of unallocated trade for both exports and imports,<lb/> while other countries have high shares in just exports or imports. For example, Norway has high<lb/> unallocated shares for exports compared to imports while Mexico has higher shares for imports. Note that<lb/> for certain countries such as Australia, Russia and South Africa, unallocated products can account for a<lb/> significant share of the total trade for certain years, sometimes for both exports and imports.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Of particular note are the variations of shares of unallocated trade for product across years within<lb/> countries. For example, in OECD&apos;s ITCS database, Australia has very high shares of exports not allocated<lb/> by product from 1990 to 2000 (14-19%) which drops to about 7% in 2005. Reasons for such variations can<lb/> include improvements in identifying transactions; changes in trading structures so that more or fewer<lb/> transactions in &quot; confidential trade &quot; are undertaken; or changes in the way such data are reported – from<lb/> providing data by partner but not by product to providing data by product but not by partner or vice versa.<lb/></figure>

As with unallocated products,<lb/> the shares vary across countries and across years within countries. Of particular note are the high and<lb/> increasing shares of imports from unspecified partners apparent for India and Israel. It should be noted that<lb/> for some countries a notable proportion of trade is reported with neither partner nor commodity. Also, the<lb/> share of trade allocated to recognised partners and commodities can be relatively low, even for OECD<lb/> countries – for example, for Australia, only 83% of exports are allocated to partner countries and HS<lb/> 2-digit commodities in 2005. Care should thus be taken when using the apparent structure of such a subset<lb/> to determine the structure of total trade.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> details the sectoral shares of unspecified partners&apos; trade in total merchandise trade for an<lb/> aggregate of 41 OECD and non-OECD countries. In general, the &quot; energy-producing sectors &quot; (Mining and<lb/> quarrying, Coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel and Utilities) are the most commonly<lb/> reported without reference to partner countries. Close inspection reveals, however, that such practices are<lb/> concentrated in certain countries for certain sectors. For example, for Mining and Quarrying exports, the<lb/> shares are mainly explained by Russia where during 2000-2006, about 30% of exports were recorded<lb/> without a partner country – while for imports, the overall share is mainly due to the non-recording of<lb/> partners by Germany (30%) and India (49%).<lb/> A consequence of such variations in reporting &quot; confidential &quot; or &quot; unallocated &quot; trade is that if it affects<lb/> a small subset of products or partners, then any analyses of data over time for these products or partners<lb/> may be subject to biases – and it is often not easy to identify which products and/or partners are affected.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.3. Scrap metal, waste products and secondhand goods<lb/></head>

			<p>The increasing movement of scrap metal and assorted waste around the world is of obvious concern to<lb/> environmental analysts, particularly the increasing exports from developed to developing countries, so it is<lb/> important to be able to distinguish such products in international trade statistics. In a more general sense,<lb/> when linking trade in goods data to I-O tables, we need to be able to distinguish scrap metal, waste<lb/> products and secondhand goods from the output of recent manufacturing production and, for example,<lb/> identify imported inputs into the recycling industry. Currently, scrap metal and certain waste products<lb/> (e.g. paper and plastic) can be identified as they are coded in HS – see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. However, there are many<lb/> types of used goods, such as discarded PCs and secondhand transport equipment that do not have separate<lb/> codes in HS and are thus difficult to identify in trade statistics – they may be &quot; recorded and classified<lb/> under the appropriate commodity heading if their value is positive &quot; . (The United Nations, 1998, para. 41)<lb/></p>

			<p>When looking at trade in identifiable scrap and waste (<ref type="table">Table 8</ref>), it is no surprise that non-OECD<lb/> countries have higher and increasing import shares (e.g. China and India with about 1.8% each in 2005)<lb/> while OECD countries tend to have higher export shares (exceptions include Korea and Turkey). On<lb/> average, the import share for non-OECD countries was about 1% in 2005, double that for OECD, while for<lb/> exports, the OECD share was about 0.6%, double that for non-OECD countries. It is important to note that<lb/> for many countries, scrap and waste materials may be exported to (or imported from) a limited number of<lb/> trading partners so that while the share of such trade may be relatively low at total world level, it can be<lb/> quite significant when looking at certain bilateral trade flows.

			<head>2.3.4. Differences in published merchandise trade statistics<lb/></head>

			<p>One source of frustration for researchers in recent years has been apparent differences in trade in<lb/> goods data from different published sources. While differences between OECD ITCS and Eurostat trade<lb/> data are to be expected, not least because of the latter&apos;s use of the Intrastat system, differences between<lb/> OECD ITCS and UN Comtrade are less intuitive since common definitions are generally applied.<lb/> Previously, OECD and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) developed their merchandise trade<lb/> statistics systems independently. However since 2001, via a &quot; Memorandum of Understanding &quot; , both<lb/> organisations have been sharing data sources 16 . The general idea behind the agreement is that trade data for<lb/> OECD member countries are processed by OECD while data for non-OECD countries are processed by<lb/> UNSD. While some reduction in the data reporting burden of OECD national statistical institutes has<lb/> occurred, the main aim of the exercise was the alignment and harmonisation of the UN and</p>

			<figure>OECD trade<lb/> databases. Data for years beyond 2005 have been processed by OECD and UNSD with nearly identical<lb/> software systems and during 2008 increased efforts were made to &quot; harmonise &quot; ITCS with Comtrade by<lb/> reprocessing data for all OECD countries back to 2000 with the common software and procedures.<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, even when both databases have been &quot; synchronised &quot; there remain some subtle differences.<lb/> For example, ITCS has a more detailed treatment of &quot; unallocated trade &quot; (see 2.3.2, also known as<lb/> &quot; memoranda items &quot; ), for EU countries than UNSD – it hosts a range of special 6-digit product codes for<lb/> &quot; unallocated trade &quot; below the 2-digit HS level. A consequence is that for certain 2-digit product groups,<lb/> ITCS data may be higher than Comtrade while being lower for the general &quot; Commodities not specified<lb/> according to kind &quot; . This is illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> by a comparison between ITCS and Comtrade 2-digit HS<lb/> data for Germany, where for example, exports of HS 88 &quot; Aircraft, spacecraft and parts thereof &quot; are<lb/> reported to be 5-7% higher in ITCS than in Comtrade.<lb/></p>

			<p>For certain countries and/or years, data for years prior to 2000 may differ significantly between ITCS<lb/> and Comtrade. There may be several reasons for this such as: i) use of different versions of national source<lb/> data: i.e. first version versus subsequent revision(s); ii) differing treatment of confidential data<lb/> (e.g. allocated to partner &quot; Other Areas n.e.s. &quot; versus allocated to &quot; Commodities n.e.s. &quot; ); and iii) differing<lb/> partner country and commodity coding regimes. Such problems mainly affect data for OECD countries.<lb/> This is because the OECD has only ever processed a few non-OECD countries such as China, Hong Kong<lb/> and Chinese Taipei (not recognised by the U.N.). Resources permitting, OECD hopes to extend the<lb/> synchronisation exercise to data prior to 2000. Reviewing data for 1995 would be particularly useful as this<lb/> was a common benchmark year for national I-O tables.<lb/> 16.<lb/> For details concerning UNSD-OECD joint trade data collection and processing see Legoff, <ref type="biblio">(2005, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.5. Bilateral trade by industry classifications<lb/></head>

			<p>As well as the conceptual and statistical issues that affect the basic bilateral trade by commodity data,<lb/> such as re-exports and unallocated trade, there are additional challenges to be faced when attempting to<lb/> estimate trade flows by economic activity (whether producers of primary products, manufactures or<lb/> services). When linking industry x industry I-O tables for inter-country I-O analysis, matrices of bilateral<lb/> trade according to an industry classification are required, yet there are particular problems when<lb/> constructing such matrices.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For some years the OECD has produced the Bilateral Trade Database (BTD) for industrial analysis<lb/> which presents trade in goods according to economic activities, most recently using a classification based<lb/> on ISIC Rev.3. It is designed to be comparable with other data sets in OECD&apos;s &quot; STAN family &quot; including<lb/> OECD&apos;s I-O tables 17 . BTD is compiled from OECD&apos;s ITCS by using a standard conversion from the 1988<lb/> version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS 1988) to ISIC Rev.3 for all<lb/> countries 18 . Data recorded in later versions of HS (HS 1996, HS 2002) are converted to HS 1988<lb/> beforehand. The drawbacks of this standard approach include the following:<lb/></figure>

			<p>• BTD does not necessarily provide explicit trade figures for industry: products are linked to the<lb/> industries that typically produce them (and thus in this case, BTD assumes &quot; homogeneity &quot; in<lb/> industries). For industrial activity data, enterprises (or establishments) are allocated an ISIC code<lb/> according to their primary activity. If an industry has significant goods producing secondary<lb/> activities, its exports in BTD may be underestimated (and over-estimated in the industry deemed<lb/> likely to produce the goods).<lb/> • BTD presents estimates for all imports from partners&apos; industries, not intermediate imports by<lb/> domestic industries. While useful for developing indicators such as import penetration by<lb/> industry, this restricts the use of BTD imports for linking to imports of intermediates by industry<lb/> that are present in I-O tables.<lb/></p>

			<p>• There are very few product codes allocated to service industries. However, industrial activity data<lb/> for some service sectors (e.g. wholesale and retail) may include enterprises involved in assembly<lb/> and export of final goods (e.g. PCs), considered as secondary activities. This is not recorded in<lb/> BTD (c.f. first bullet above).<lb/> • Exported output of recycling industry cannot be identified.<lb/></p>

			<p>The consequences of some of the issues described above are illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>, which shows<lb/> exports as a percentage of production (gross output) for the ISIC Rev.3 activity &quot; Office, accounting and<lb/> computing machinery &quot; . For many countries the estimated value of exports is significantly greater than<lb/> production. While the main reason may be the presence of re-exports (particularly for Belgium and the<lb/> Netherlands), there are undoubtedly cases where wholesale firms are involved in the assembly and export<lb/> of PCs. Exports of used PCs to developing countries for re-use or dismantling may also be included, but<lb/> the value is probably quite low. In other words, in OECD countries, &quot; true &quot; manufacturing of PCs is not as<lb/> prevalent as exports data may suggest.<lb/></p>

			<table>17.<lb/> BTD (OECD, 2008) was first developed by OECD&apos;s Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry in<lb/> the early 1990s as part of a project to provide data tools for &quot; advanced &quot; structural analysis such as the<lb/> measurement of international technology diffusion. Other data sets developed, and still maintained, include<lb/> the I-O database, STAN industry database (www.oecd.org/sti/stan) and the business R&amp;D expenditure<lb/> (ANBERD) database (www.oecd.org/sti/anberd).<lb/> 18.<lb/> www.oecd.org/dataoecd/50/24/37990672.xls.<lb/> Table 10.

			<head>3. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN SERVICES<lb/> 3.1. Sources of data – Balance of Payments<lb/></head>

			<p>International trade in services is defined as the supply of a service with four GATS modes of<lb/> provision: 1. Cross-border supply, 2. Consumption abroad, 3. Commercial presence and 4. Presence of<lb/> natural persons (United Nations, 2002, page 11; and page 23 for a graphical summary). The well<lb/> established Balance of Payments accounts cover the first two, as well as aspects of modes 3. and 4., and is<lb/> the principle source for estimates of bilateral trade in services. There is no equivalent of detailed customs<lb/> records for measuring international service transactions.<lb/> In the currently used recommendations of the 5 th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5),<lb/> international service transactions are classified into a dozen or so major categories with some additional<lb/> detail (see IMF, 1993, page 43). More detailed information became available with the development and<lb/> introduction from 1996 of the Extended Balance of Payment Services (EBOPS) classification (United<lb/> Nations, 2002, pages 29-53). A concordance table is provided between EBOPS and the CPC Ver.1<lb/> production classification (United Nations, 2002, Annex III). However, reconciling the EBOPS<lb/> classification with the activity classification used in harmonised industry x industry I-O tables is not<lb/> straightforward (Annex <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). For example, the subcategories of &quot; Travel &quot; (EBOPS236), &quot; Business<lb/> travel expenditure &quot; (EBOPS237) and &quot; Personal travel expenditure &quot; (EBOPS240), cover purchases from a<lb/> variety of service industries such as accommodation, restaurants and retail.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Availability of bilateral trade in services statistics<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite substantial improvements in recent years, published bilateral trade in services data are still<lb/> quite limited compared to the availability of bilateral trade in goods. While most exports and imports<lb/> figures of commodity trade for all partners of our target of 40 or so countries are available, the number of<lb/> available figures of exports (credit) and imports (debit) are limited for services sectors. In the OECD Trade<lb/> in Services by partner countries database, 34 of our targeted reporter countries are currently covered, while<lb/> in UN Service Trade dataset, 29 reporter countries are covered. OECD Trade in Services provide as much<lb/> data as possible by different service categories among partner countries, while UN Service Trade only has<lb/> trade data on countries with the world as their partner.<lb/> Although the availability of data on bilateral trade in services is expanding steadily, there remain<lb/> conceptual differences between EBOPS and activity classifications such as ISIC Rev.3. One solution for<lb/> developing appropriate bilateral trade in service matrices for linking I-O tables is to exploit existing<lb/> bilateral trade in services data through use of non-survey modelling techniques such as gravity equations<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Kimura and Lee, 2006</ref>).<lb/> Differences not only exist for trade in goods, they also occur in trade in service statistics, for example<lb/> between UN and OECD trade in service databases. Encouragingly, notable differences in total trade in<lb/> services are observed for few countries (see <ref type="table">Table 12</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4. IMPENDING CHANGES TO BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFINITIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Two types of international transactions that will be recorded differently in the forthcoming revisions<lb/> to BoP recommendations, BPM6, and the System of National Accounts (SNA 1993 Rev.1), to be finalised<lb/> in 2009, are &quot; Goods sent abroad for processing &quot; and &quot; Merchanting &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1. Goods sent abroad for processing<lb/></head>

			<p>Goods sent abroad for processing are defined as materials or semi-processed goods belonging to a unit<lb/> in country A which are shipped to a unit in country B for significant transformation and then either i) are<lb/> returned to the original unit in country A; ii) enter domestic economy of B; or iii) are exported to a third<lb/> country C. The goods do not change ownership from A to B and B receives a fee from A for processing the<lb/> goods. Minor transformations of goods, such as repair and packaging are not regarded as processing and<lb/> are excluded from this consideration. See Chapter 4 of United Nations (2008) for detailed discussion.<lb/> Under BPM5 and SNA 1993, &quot; goods for processing &quot; are recorded in both exports and imports of<lb/> goods as genuine external trade in gross terms although no change of ownership has taken place. This is<lb/> contrary to the basic principle of Balance of Payments that transactions should involve a change of<lb/> ownership. To rectify this, under the new recommendations, goods for processing will be excluded from<lb/> exports and imports in the goods accounts. Instead, the exchange of processing fees will be recorded under<lb/> services in the economies concerned: the outward processing economy recording payment of fees as<lb/> imports of services, the inward processing economy recording the receipt of fees as exports of services.<lb/> Thus there will be a mismatch with the physical movement of goods recorded in customs-based<lb/> merchandise trade statistics.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2. Merchanting<lb/></head>

			<p>Merchanting is defined as the purchase of a good by a resident (of compiling economy A) from a<lb/> non-resident in country B and the subsequent resale of the good to another non-resident in country C.<lb/> During the process, the good does not enter or leave the compiling economy A. The difference between the<lb/> value of goods when acquired and the value when sold is recorded, under BPM5, as a merchanting service<lb/> credit in country A. Three categories of merchanting can be identified: &quot; Transactions accompanied by<lb/> global manufacturing &quot; , &quot; Global wholesaling &quot; and &quot; Commodity dealing &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Takeda, 2006</ref>). Under BPM6, the<lb/> merchant&apos;s margin will be recorded in the goods account of economy A as a &quot; net export under<lb/> merchanting &quot; . Thus, as with goods for processing, there will be a mismatch with the physical movement of<lb/> goods recorded in customs-based merchandise trade statistics.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3. Impact of changes<lb/></head>

			<p>In international merchandise trade statistics, goods for processing will continue to be recorded on a<lb/> gross basis (i.e. as exports for the processing country if returning goods to country of ownership), as will<lb/> the movement of goods under merchanting. Therefore, any approach adopted for adjusting/analysing<lb/> bilateral merchandise trade statistics will not necessarily have to change. However, when linking to<lb/> Supply-Use and I-O tables, there could be increased difficulties in reconciling the merchandise trade data<lb/> with SNA 1993 Rev.1 data since, for example, many transactions previously recorded as manufactured<lb/> goods in I-O tables will now be recorded as services. Given the time lags (2-3 years or more) involved in<lb/> implementing major changes to international standards, it is not expected that there will be a great impact<lb/> on harmonising and linking forthcoming 2005 (benchmark) I-O tables. However, when the time comes to<lb/> focus on 2010 I-O tables these issues will need to be addressed.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper highlights some issues that need to be taken into consideration when using bilateral trade<lb/> in goods statistics from existing international databases in order to construct multi-national I-O tables. For<lb/> researchers undertaking such work, the goal is to produce the best possible bilateral trade in goods and<lb/> services matrices that can be linked to the trade data present in harmonised I-O tables via, for example, a<lb/> multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model (as described in Box 1). Even if only analysing trade statistics,<lb/> the issues are worth taking into account.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to make the best possible use of existing trade statistics some short-term solutions could help<lb/> make necessary adjustments:<lb/> • Re-exports are of the most immediate concern due to their increasing shares in total trade<lb/> reported by many countries. Starting with countries with significant re-exports, national statistical<lb/> authorities could be requested to provide information on re-exports at the most detailed level<lb/> possible by partner and/or commodity for a few key years (e.g. 2000 and 2005). Some countries<lb/> have already carried out research concerning re-exports and their results could be exploited.<lb/></p>

			<p>• For unallocated trade, national statistical authorities or research institutes with local knowledge<lb/> may be able to provide indications of the composition &quot; unallocated trade &quot; reported in OECD and<lb/> UNSD databases. Again, efforts should first be concentrated on the countries where the problem<lb/> is predominant.<lb/> • Identifying secondhand goods and assorted scrap and waste may be possible, under certain<lb/> circumstances, by exploiting quantity information and analysing average unit values of<lb/> transactions between countries.<lb/> • The most significant BoP adjustment concerns removing c.i.f. from total imports of goods and<lb/> allocating to services. For imports by commodity (or industry) c.i.f. adjustments could be made<lb/> on a pro rata basis, but it may be preferable for researchers to continue to benchmark bilateral<lb/> imports on the imports present in I-O tables with possible further adjustments for certain partner<lb/> countries based on distance matrices. In fact, understanding how national statisticians estimate<lb/> merchandise imports and exports by product (or industry) for integration into SUTs and I-O<lb/> tables could be beneficial. GTAP tackle this problem via bilateral estimates of transport margins<lb/> based on information from U.S. Census Bureau 19 .<lb/></p>

			<p>• Close inspection of detailed HS categories in order to identify, where possible, products that are<lb/> likely to be intermediate goods rather than final consumption goods. For example, referring to<lb/> UN classification of Broad Economic Categories (BEC Rev.3) and/or concentrating on HS codes<lb/> for parts and components – cf. Yeats (1998) and use of SITC Rev.2 based list. A minimum<lb/> requirement when using I-O tables in conjunction with trade data is having consistent estimates<lb/> of the shares of imports of intermediate goods in total imports by industry.<lb/> 19.<lb/> www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=1868.<lb/> Long-term solutions to improve trade statistics databases could include:<lb/> • systematic reporting of re-exports for all countries;<lb/> • more detailed reporting of &quot; unallocated trade &quot; without breaking any confidentiality barriers;<lb/> • additional product codes (or other coding system) to identify secondhand goods and waste and<lb/> scrap not currently coded;<lb/> • additional product codes (or other coding system) to identify recycled goods;<lb/> • reporting of Balance of Payments trade in goods by commodity groups (i.e. adjustments below<lb/> the level of total goods);<lb/></p>

			<p>• introduce export and import variables for goods and services in structural business statistics; and<lb/> • encourage more countries to produce (more) detailed bilateral trade in services data.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whatever progress is made towards producing &quot; ideal &quot; bilateral trade matrices, researchers will still<lb/> need to build econometric models to fill the data shortage. However, this paper provides some insights as<lb/> why certain difficulties in matching trade and I-O may occur and so help researchers focus their efforts<lb/> when carrying out further data adjustments. Furthermore, the paper provides the groundwork for a possible<lb/> OECD project to develop improved bilateral trade matrices for use with I-O tables.<lb/> -<lb/></p>
