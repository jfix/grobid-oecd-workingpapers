<bibl>Source: OECD Scoreboard 2007.<lb/> Total spending on R&amp;D (1.5% of GDP) is significantly lower than the 2.3% average of OECD<lb/> countries in 2005. Most countries with lower R&amp;D spending also have lower per capita income (Annex<lb/> </bibl>
        <bibl><label>3.</label>A, Figure 3.A.4). The ratio has been lower than that of EU countries for more than 20 years and there is<lb/> no sign of convergence. Private sector R&amp;D spending is particularly low, business R&amp;D spending<lb/> amounting to only 1.2% of industry value added compared to 2.2% for OECD countries in 2005 (Annex<lb/> 3.A Figure 3.A.5). The gap in private R&amp;D spending is very large relative to other high per capita income<lb/> countries (Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland), notwithstanding an R&amp;D tax credit scheme introduced in<lb/> 2002 (Skattefunn).<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>According to national surveys, only 26% of Norwegian enterprises conducted innovation-related<lb/> activities in the period 2002-2004. 55 The reported innovation activity is a little lower than for the period<lb/> 1999-2001 (29%). SMEs seem to lag behind many other OECD countries in terms of product and process<lb/> innovation (Annex 3.A, Figures 3.A.6 and 7). SMEs in Norway collaborate less in innovation activities<lb/> than elsewhere, notably compared to other Nordic countries (Figure 3.4).<lb/> </bibl>

Aimed at<lb/> improving SMEs&apos; efficiency and competitiveness, the plan promoted the diffusion of best-<lb/>practices to upgrade product quality and innovation and technology capacity through modern<lb/> management techniques, new financial instruments and partnerships with universities and foreign<lb/> companies. The plan also called for better service delivery to SMEs creating and expanding<lb/> specialised support units (service stations).<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>The EU-Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (2006)<lb/> The 9 th Development Plan (2007-2013) and the SME Strategy and Action Plan have been shaped in<lb/> close correspondence with the 2006 EU legal framework governing pre-accession assistance for<lb/> &apos;candidate&apos; countries. The EU Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) covering the period<lb/> 2007-2013 helps aspiring countries qualify for the receipt of EU structural funds guiding them on their<lb/> path to eventual EU membership. IPA assists these countries in their efforts to align themselves on EU<lb/> standards and policy practices. It distinguishes between five intervention areas (components). These<lb/> comprise Transition Assistance and Institutional Building, Cross-Border Cooperation, Regional<lb/> Development, Human Resources Development and Rural development. The intervention area &apos;Regional<lb/> Development&apos; consists of three sub-components one of which &apos;The Operational Programme for Regional<lb/> Competitiveness&apos; (RCOP, 2007-2009) provides a new framework for Turkey&apos;s entrepreneurship and SME<lb/> policies (Figure 4.A.1).<lb/> </bibl>

The programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the IPA assistance<lb/> processes constitute indispensable tools to qualify Turkey for the receipt of EU structural funds. Concrete<lb/> &apos;outputs&apos; of the IPA process are so-called Operational Programmes, one of which is the Operational<lb/> Programme for Regional Competitiveness (RCOP). The thrust of Turkeys&apos; new entrepreneurship and SME<lb/> policies are enshrined in this programme. RCOP has been prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade<lb/> in collaboration with central and regional policy stakeholders, the EU Commission and the State Planning<lb/> Organisation (SPO). Its operating structure is provided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Figure<lb/> 4.A.2).<lb/> </bibl>
