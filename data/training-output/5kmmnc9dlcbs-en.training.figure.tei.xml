            <figDesc>Another difficulty in the context of emissions trading is that the European Emissions Trading<lb/> System (EU ETS) covers CO 2 emissions from power production but not emissions caused by<lb/> cars and buses. Aviation will be included from 2012. In contrast, the proposed American<lb/> scheme (The Waxman-Markey Bill) 9 covers not only fossil energy used in power production<lb/> but also emissions from fuels delivered to any mode of transportation (by an up-stream<lb/> approach). As all emissions from transportation are subject to the scheme, one could argue<lb/> that any expansion of demand for road fuels could not alter the cap. If so there would be no<lb/> need to worry about gas-guzzling SUVs. However, also in this case there is an evident risk<lb/> that a high price will prevent future politicians from following the route outlined in the bill,<lb/> which says emissions should be cut by 80 per cent by 2050 from 2005 levels.</figDesc>

High speed<lb/> lines between Stockholm and Gothenburg (460 km) and Stockholm and Malmoe (615 km),<lb/> Sweden&apos;s three largest cities, are expected to cut travel times by respectively 27 and 44 per<lb/> cent (from 2:45 to 2:00 hours in the case of Stockholm-Gothenburg).
