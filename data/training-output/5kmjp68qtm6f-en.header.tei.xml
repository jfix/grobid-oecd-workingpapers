	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Passenger vehicles are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and prodigious consumers of<lb/> petroleum, making their fuel economy an important focus of energy policy. Whether or not the market<lb/> for fuel economy functions efficiently has important implications for both the type and intensity of<lb/> energy and environmental policies for motor vehicles. There are undoubtedly imperfections in the<lb/> market for fuel economy but their consequences are difficult to quantify. The evidence from<lb/> econometric studies, mostly from the US, is reviewed and shown to vary widely, providing evidence<lb/> for both significant under-and over-valuation and everything in between. Market research is scarce,<lb/> but indicates that the rational economic model, in general, does not appear to be used by consumers<lb/> when comparing the fuel economy of new vehicles. Some recent studies have stressed the role of<lb/> uncertainty and risk or loss aversion in consumers&apos; decision making. Uncertainty plus loss aversion<lb/> appears to be a reasonable theoretical model of consumers&apos; evaluation of fuel economy, with profound<lb/> implications for manufacturers&apos; technology and design decisions. The theory implies that markets will<lb/> substantially undervalue fuel economy relative to its expected present value. It also has potentially<lb/> important implications for welfare analysis of alternative policy instruments.</div>
