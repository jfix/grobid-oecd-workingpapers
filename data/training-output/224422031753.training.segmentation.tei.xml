			<body>Executive Summary <lb/>The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical analysis of the developments and determinants <lb/>of agricultural trade flows by determining whether the growth in agricultural trade has taken place at <lb/>the intensive or the extensive margin. This paper presents new work examining the evolution of agro-<lb/>food exports between 1996 and 2006 for 69 countries. The paper addresses the questions: have <lb/>agricultural exports during this period expanded more through the intensive margin (more exports of <lb/>established goods to traditional partners) or through the extensive margin (new trade flows in new <lb/>products and/or to new partners)? At the intensive margin, do richer countries export greater volumes, <lb/>or do they receive higher prices for their goods? At the extensive margin, are new trade flows the <lb/>result of an expanded variety of products or the result of exporting established products to more <lb/>destinations? <lb/>Trade occurs because the parties that engage in the transaction find it beneficial. On the export <lb/>side, expanding markets enables the exploitation of comparative advantage, while firms can reduce <lb/>costs by increasing the scale of their production, improve productivity and increase producer surplus. <lb/>On the import side, welfare in enhanced through consumption of lower priced goods and through the <lb/>availability of a larger variety of goods. In this paper, the focus is on the export side of the ledger <lb/>although the reader should remember that the importer also benefits. <lb/>Exports can grow as firms export more and/or at higher prices for the products they have been <lb/>producing to their existing partners (the intensive margin). Exports can also grow through market <lb/>development as firms export their existing products to new partners or through innovation, developing <lb/>new products and exporting them either to existing partners or to new markets (the extensive margin). <lb/>This study assesses the growth in agricultural trade from 1996 to 2006 and decomposes the <lb/>growth into the extensive and intensive margin. Three approaches are used on disaggregated <lb/>agricultural trade data for 69 exporting countries to determine the contribution of the margins to <lb/>growing agricultural exports. One is a cross sectional approach. This utilises a country&apos;s bilateral <lb/>export data at a given point in time and computes its intensive and extensive margin. This approach <lb/>allows one to answer the question: &quot; do richer countries export more agricultural products at the <lb/>intensive or extensive margin? &quot; In addition, the question of whether agricultural exports of richer <lb/>countries are higher quality can be ascertained. <lb/>An alternative approach is more descriptive, using a country&apos;s bilateral export data to compare <lb/>performance in two points in time. By computing the change in exports between the two time periods <lb/>and decomposing that growth into the two margins, one can answer whether the growth in agricultural <lb/>exports for any exporter occurred mostly at the extensive or intensive margin. This abstracts from the <lb/>relative contribution of policy and other factors to that growth. <lb/>The third approach used in the study is based on estimating a gravity-type equation to explain <lb/>bilateral exports. This approach explains bilateral trade flows by decomposing the total effect into the <lb/>extensive margin through explaining the change in trade flows from non-existing to positive flows and <lb/>the intensive margin by examining the change in flows that are positive throughout. <lb/></body>

			<body>• From the cross section approach, the study finds that when agricultural value added (AVA) <lb/>is used to indicate a country&apos;s size or export potential, for every 10% increase in AVA, <lb/>agricultural exports (in 2006) increase by 5%. Most of the additional exports (53%) are at the <lb/>intensive margin, countries exporting more of the same set of products to existing partners. <lb/>But, when a country&apos;s GDP is used as a measure of its size or export potential, the results <lb/>suggest that richer countries export more agricultural products and they export more <lb/>products to more destinations, that is, they have a more diversified export basket with the <lb/>extensive margin accounting for 55% of their additional agricultural exports (in 2006). This <lb/>result may be due to the fact that more and more of agricultural exports are in processed <lb/>products that more closely resemble manufactured products. It also finds that firms in richer <lb/>countries export higher quality agricultural products obtaining an 18% price premium in <lb/>2006.<lb/>• From the descriptive statistics, when the focus is on how agricultural exports have grown <lb/>over time, the study finds that the majority of the overall growth in agricultural exports for <lb/>all sampled countries was at the intensive margin, with firms selling more of their existing <lb/>goods to their existing partners. But, for 44 out of the 69 countries, the extensive margin <lb/>contributed more than 50% to the growth in agricultural export over the 1996 to 2006 period. <lb/>This implies that the extensive margin is important for many countries that are not among the <lb/>largest exporters. And, many of these exporting countries are developing countries <lb/>suggesting that they are diversifying their export basket.<lb/>• From the gravity-type approach, preliminary results from the study indicate that trade <lb/>frictions have a larger (absolute value) impact on trade flows than demand factors on both <lb/>margins. Additional agricultural exports are mostly generated by changes on the intensive <lb/>margin. Increasing trade flows at the extensive margin is difficult. Although this avenue of <lb/>export growth is statistically significant its contribution to the overall increase is small.<lb/>1. <lb/>Thus, the importance of the extensive margin to growing agricultural exports depends on the <lb/>measure used. Nonetheless, all three methods indicate that the extensive margin contributes in various <lb/>degrees to the growing agricultural exports. This has implications on modelling trade reform. Models <lb/>that are not capturing this source of growth will underestimate the potential impacts from reform. <lb/>2. <lb/>The preliminary results also highlight the importance of trade resistance or trade costs on the <lb/>existing trade flows and on the probability of forming new trading relationships. Although the analysis <lb/>abstracts from the many policy changes that occurred, it seems that there is a large pay-off to policies <lb/>that can reduce those frictions. In this analysis, distance was used to proxy these trading costs. Further <lb/>efforts to explicitly include trading costs such as tariffs, standards, informational costs, or <lb/>infrastructural impediments into the analysis may improve our understanding of their effects on trade <lb/>flows at the intensive and extensive margins. More detailed analysis at the individual product level <lb/>may also help illuminate the characteristics of those innovative products that develop (or not) into <lb/>major trade flows. <lb/></body>

			<body>EXTENSIVE MARGINS IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Trade occurs because the parties that engage in the transaction find it beneficial. On the export <lb/>side, expanding markets enables the exploitation of comparative advantage, while firms can reduce <lb/>costs by increasing the scale of their production, improve productivity and increase producer surplus. <lb/>On the import side, welfare is enhanced through consumption of lower priced goods and through the <lb/>availability of a larger variety of goods. In this paper, the focus is on the export side of the ledger <lb/>although the reader should remember that the importer also benefits. Firms that are engaged in <lb/>exporting tend to be larger, more productive and more efficient than firms in the same industry that do <lb/>not export. By exporting more, firms can become more productive and can realize economies of scale <lb/>through serving a larger market. But, there is information and other learning costs to exporting as <lb/>firms have to understand the various destination markets, tailor their products to satisfy local norms, <lb/>ship over greater distances, and overcome custom and other administrative costs. The benefits are <lb/>increased profitability for the firms and higher employment and other social benefits for the home <lb/>country. For the importing countries, additional availability and variety increase consumer welfare. <lb/>Exports can grow through increasing the volume of products, increasing their price (unit value), <lb/>or by exporting new products and developing new trading partners. Increasing exports through higher <lb/>volumes, at the intensive margin, can be an indication that a country is making the most of its <lb/>comparative advantage and firms in those industries are exploiting economies of scale and are <lb/>becoming more efficient. A potential downside is that overly relying on a fixed set of export goods <lb/>may lead to declining export prices from the expanded supply along with increased volatility from <lb/>exogenous shocks. In this light, a diversified export basket is presumed to minimize the variability of <lb/>export earnings while reducing the potential for declining terms of trade while encouraging <lb/>innovation. Creating new or higher quality products and developing new trading partners, can spur <lb/>productivity and economic growth. This distinction on how exports may grow has only recently <lb/>received attention in the literature. Most of the gravity-type of analyses estimating bilateral trade flows <lb/>have overlooked this distinction as estimates are based on data that only includes trade that is taking <lb/>place indistinguishable whether the data reflect trade in established products with existing partners <lb/>(the intensive margin) or trade in new products and/or to new partners (the extensive margin). <lb/>Comparative static and other non-gravity models used to assess effects of trade or other reforms also <lb/>abstract from the effects of policy reform on export variety. <lb/>Distinguishing whether export growth is predominantly at the intensive or extensive margin, in <lb/>addition to providing a better understanding of the dynamics of growth and insights into productivity <lb/>and innovation, can also provide richer analysis of the benefits or gains from trade liberalisation, <lb/>giving insights on gains that are missing from conventional models that abstract from this distinction. <lb/>For example, recent findings by Feenstra and Kee (2007) indicate that Mexico and China have <lb/>expanded the varieties exported to the US following tariff reductions in the US. Similarly, Debaere <lb/>and Moshashari (2005) for a wider set of countries also find that their export basket to the US <lb/>increased following lower US import tariffs. Furthermore, they report that countries differ in the <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>variety of goods they export and also in the range of countries with which they trade. Moreover, the <lb/>sets of countries and goods change over time and vary more than traditional models would indicate. <lb/>Whether trade grows at the intensive or extensive margin matters because the welfare <lb/>implications of policy reform can differ. Expanding exports at the intensive margin can drive down the <lb/>price of these goods on the world market, worsening a country&apos;s terms of trade. In CGE models such <lb/>as GTAP, these terms of trade effects are significant. If, on the other hand, additional exports are <lb/>generated through the extensive margin, adverse terms of trade effects may not materialize. Rather <lb/>than sliding down the demand curve for their goods, growing at the extensive margin implies <lb/>exporting more goods to more markets and an outward shift in demand. Models not incorporating the <lb/>extensive margin may underestimate the effects of trade reform. Included in this category are partial or <lb/>general equilibrium models that are based on the Armington assumption of product differentiation as <lb/>well as models that assume homogeneous products. Trade in many partial equilibrium models tends <lb/>not to be modelled explicitly (usually represented as the difference between demand and supply) <lb/>hence, abstracting from distinctions about product variety and trading partners, two means for trade at <lb/>the extensive margin. <lb/>Below, we examine the relative contribution of the intensive and extensive margin to the change <lb/>in agricultural exports of 69 major exporters. Have their agricultural exports expanded through <lb/>increases in the volume exported or through providing an expanded set of products to new trading <lb/>partners during 1996 to 2006? As discussed below, there are alternative approaches to analysing this <lb/>question. We employ several of them to provide a richer understanding of the relative contribution of <lb/>each margin to agricultural exports during this period. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to <lb/>look at the extensive and intensive margin of agricultural exports for such a large number of <lb/>agricultural exporters. <lb/>The next section discusses the different approaches to analysing trade at the extensive and <lb/>intensive margin. This is followed by a description of the data used, a discussion of the main findings <lb/>while the last section provides some conclusions. <lb/>How is the intensive and extensive margin measured? <lb/>Among the recent trade literature focused on distinguishing the source of trade growth between <lb/>the extensive and intensive margins, researches have utilised different approaches to address the issue. <lb/>One approach has focussed on developing measures of the extensive or intensive margins and then <lb/>assessing how tariffs, other costs to exporting, or economic size, among others, affect this measure. <lb/>Examples include Brendon and Newfarmer (2007), Debaere and Mostashari (2005), Dennis and <lb/>Shepherd (2007), Feenstra and Kee (2007), and Hummels and Klenow (2002). Another more <lb/>descriptive approach compares a country&apos;s bilateral exports at two points in time to determine the <lb/>relative contribution of each margin to the country&apos;s export growth. Examples include Brendon and <lb/>Newfarmer(2007) and Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola (2008). In another alternative, researchers, rather <lb/>than measuring the extensive or intensive margin explicitly, employ gravity-type equations but focus <lb/>on the appearance of new trading relationships. Examples include Felbermayr and Kohler (2006), <lb/>Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008), and Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola (2008). All approaches <lb/>tend to use highly disaggregated trade data for the empirical implementation of their analysis. <lb/>Researchers that have examined the intensive and extensive margin by explicitly measuring each <lb/>margin have used several different measures to calculate the extensive and intensive margin. One of <lb/>the simplest ways is to define the extensive margin as the simple count of the number of products that <lb/>a country exports, with the intensive margin as the average exports per product. This is an unweighted <lb/>measure, treating a product with exports valued at USD one thousand equal to a product with exports <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>valued at USD one million. This measure was used by Debaere and Mostashari (2005) and Dennis and <lb/>Shepherd (2007) in their analysis of the intensive and extensive margin for the US and EU <lb/>respectively. Another measure of the extensive margin treats exports of any product to each <lb/>destination as an observation. The extensive margin is the count of exports of each product and <lb/>market, while the intensive margin is the exports per product and market combination. This measure <lb/>also gives equal weight to &quot; small &quot; markets and products and &quot; large &quot; products and markets. <lb/>A more sophisticated measure of the extensive margin derived from consumers maximizing their <lb/>utility, was developed by Feenstra and Kee (2007). This measure was derived from a constant <lb/>elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator function. Their margin is a relative measure and is <lb/>interpreted as the share of total imports of the products exported by any one country. They apply their <lb/>measure of &quot; variety &quot; or extensive margin using US import data at the HS-10 digit level for exports <lb/>from Mexico and China. They use US import data because it provides greater detail for measuring <lb/>varieties, but it is not internationally comparable. Hence, the other dimension of the extensive margin, <lb/>trade with new partners, is missing. <lb/>For this analysis, in the first part the extensive and intensive margins are measured explicitly and <lb/>we use simple regression analysis to decompose exports into the intensive and extensive margin. In <lb/>measuring the intensive and extensive margin, we follow the definition provided by Hummels and <lb/>Klenow (2002) henceforth HK. The methodology is based on incorporating new varieties into a <lb/>country&apos;s price and quantity index. The price index is effectively lowered when the set of goods <lb/>expand (HK). Of special interest is the extensive and quality margin. Exporters systematically selling <lb/>large quantities at high prices may be an indication that these exporters produce higher quality goods. <lb/>The methodology allows one to answer the question; do richer countries export more agricultural <lb/>products at the intensive or extensive margin, and do they export higher quality goods? It does not <lb/>identify the factors that generate these trade flows. <lb/>HK define the intensive margin for any exporting country j as, <lb/>where χ j = nominal exports of country j, χ Wis = world exports to country i in product category s, and <lb/>X jis = the set of products and markets where exports from country j are positive i.e., χ jis &gt; 0 where χ jis <lb/>are nominal exports of country j to country i in product category s. Essentially, the equation shows that <lb/>the intensive margin is an indication of the exporting country&apos;s share of world exports in those <lb/>products and markets in which it exports. Note that the information from a country&apos;s bilateral exports <lb/>are summarised into a single measure per exporter. <lb/>The extensive margin for any exporting country j is defined as, <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>with χ W representing nominal world exports (from all countries to all countries). This is a measure of <lb/>the fraction of world exports that occur in those products and markets in which country j exports. This <lb/>definition is similar to that developed by Feenstra and Kee (2007). If a country concentrates all of its <lb/>exports in a small number of products in a few countries, all other things equal, it will have a higher <lb/>intensive margin and a lower extensive margin. If that country spreads its exports thinly over many <lb/>markets, it will have a lower intensive margin and a higher extensive margin. Note that this measure of <lb/>the extensive margin is a comparison of exports for countries at a point in time. This is a static <lb/>measure, summarising a country&apos;s bilateral exports at a point in time. It indicates the depth and <lb/>breadth of a country&apos;s export profile, but does not reflect the growth of that country&apos;s exports over <lb/>time. <lb/>The second and third approached differ from the one above by examining the growth of the <lb/>margins for a given country over time in contrast to a cross country comparison of the margins at a <lb/>given point in time. The second approach used in this study is more descriptive. After computing a <lb/>country&apos;s export growth between 1996 and 2006, trade flows are decomposed into those flows that are <lb/>persistent throughout the period, those that have expired or are no longer active and those trade flows <lb/>that are new at the end period but did not exist in the beginning. Thus, the growth is split into the <lb/>extensive and intensive margin providing an explicit measure of the relative contribution of each <lb/>margin to that country&apos;s growth. For this purpose, the intensive margin for any country j is defined as <lb/>the change in country j&apos;s exports of existing products (old products) to established trading partners <lb/>(old partners) minus the cessation of trade in old products (dead or expired products) to current <lb/>partners. The extensive margin for country j is defined as exports of products that country j had not <lb/>previously exported (new products) either to new partners (new products, new partners) or to existing <lb/>partners (new products, old partners) plus exports of existing products to new partners (old products, <lb/>new partners). Variations of this definition were used by Brenton and Newfarmer (2007) and Amurgo-<lb/>Pacheco and Pierola (2008). This approach, unlike the others, identifies the countries with the largest <lb/>growth in agricultural exports during the time period and of that growth, how much is at the extensive <lb/>margin relative to the intensive margin. Additionally, countries are grouped into different categories to <lb/>discern group differences, if any. <lb/>The last approach used in this paper is based on research that examines the intensive and <lb/>extensive margin without measuring them explicitly. Rather, the issue is addressed more generally by <lb/>specifying a gravity-type equation to explain bilateral trade flows but within the context of a problem <lb/>of missing or censored data. The point of departure for the extensive margin is that there are trading <lb/>relationships that, for a variety of reasons are not materialised at one point in time, but which may or <lb/>may not materialise at a later stage. That is, zero trade in time period one may become positive in <lb/>period two. The extensive margin in this case is defined in terms of the zero trade flows becoming <lb/>positive while the intensive margin is in terms of trade that is positive throughout the period. In this <lb/>approach, bilateral trade flows are explained using a gravity-type equation with zero trade flows <lb/>explicitly in the data. Researchers that have employed this approach include Amurgo-Pacheco and <lb/>Pierola (2008), Felbermayr and Kohler (2006), and Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008). To assess <lb/>the intensive and extensive margin with this approach we utilise a Tobit and a Probit estimation <lb/>technique to estimate bilateral exports in the presence of zero trade. <lb/></body>

			<body>Data <lb/>Bilateral agricultural exports 1 from 1996 to 2006 are from UN COMTRADE accessed through <lb/>the World Bank&apos;s World Trade Integrated Solution (WITS) system. The number of countries reporting <lb/>their exports varies. In 2006, exports from more than 130 economies were available through this <lb/>system when we downloaded the data. However, data for each of these countries is not available for all <lb/>of the variables of importance for the entire period of interest. And, since we are interested in bilateral <lb/>trade, the resulting database would have been too large for computational purposes. As it is, even with <lb/>the reduced sample size, we reached the computational limits of our software even though there are <lb/>countries with missing data for some variables in some years. Our dataset is based on 69 2 of those <lb/>exporting countries and uses their export data at the most detailed level possible that is internationally <lb/>compatible, trade at the HS-6 digit level during 1996 to 2006. 3 For any exporting country, the data <lb/>reports the value (in US dollars) and quantity of each product (at the HS-6 digit level) exported and for <lb/>each destination. The selected countries were chosen based on their importance in agricultural exports. <lb/>All countries with at least USD 2 billion in agricultural exports in 2006 were included. This criterion <lb/>identified 47 economies with agricultural exports above USD 2 billion, and these 47 countries <lb/>represented about 94% of world&apos;s total agricultural exports in 2006. Additional countries with <lb/>agricultural exports below USD 2 billion that were added to the sample included all remaining OECD <lb/>members (Finland, Iceland, Norway, and the Slovak Republic), and the remaining countries that are <lb/>candidates for accession to the OECD, (Estonia, Israel, and Slovenia. Chile and Russia are also <lb/>included as each had more than USD 2 billion in exports). Because we are interested in how <lb/>agricultural exports have evolved over time, by necessity, our sample will constitute the largest <lb/>players. To round out the sample, 8 additional lower middle income countries along with 8 low <lb/>income countries were chosen to provide a broad geographic representation and to reduce selection <lb/>bias in terms of income or of being a large agricultural exporting country. Most of the 16 additional <lb/>countries (that are not large agricultural exporters in an absolute sense), had a comparative advantage <lb/>in agriculture in the OECD study &quot; Patterns in Agriculture and Food Trade: 1985-2004 &quot; (OECD 2007). <lb/>With the additional countries, the coverage of agricultural exports increased to 97% of world&apos;s total in <lb/>2006 (complete listing of the economies in the sample is in Appendix Table 1). The results presented <lb/>below based on this sample, therefore, can be considered representative. Because we calculate a price <lb/>and a quantity index for the analysis, export data with missing quantity units are dropped from the <lb/>sample. This has a relatively small impact on the overall data that were used. Depending on the year, <lb/>missing quantity units account for 1% to 3% of the total value of agricultural exports. <lb/>This bilateral export dataset is uni-directional. That is, it reports exports from country j to <lb/>importing country i in product category k with j i k indexing all exporters, their trading partners and <lb/>export basket. A reciprocal trade flow from i to j in product k may or may not exist for any i j k. That <lb/>is, there are possible trading relationships that have not materialised. In typical export data such as the <lb/>one we use, these data do not exist. And, until recently, most estimates of trading behaviour have <lb/>ignored these data. But, given our interest in the extensive and intensive margin, we cannot ignore <lb/>these &quot; missing &quot; data. The analysis of the growth in exports at the extensive margin based on a gravity-<lb/>type equation, depends on assessing how these non-existing trading relationships (the zeros) develop <lb/>1 <lb/>Goods included in this category are products in HS Chapters 1-24 except fish and several other categories <lb/>in Chapter 29 to 53 as defined in the WTO. <lb/>2 <lb/>In the early years of the analysis, Belgium and Luxembourg reported trade data as a single country. <lb/>For consistency, their data were aggregated in subsequent years. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 <lb/>For any exporter, the data reports all their bilateral exports at the HS-6 digit level (referred to as <lb/>products or goods in the report). Unfortunately, export data may not be available for each country in <lb/>each year. <lb/></note>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>into positive trade thus, growing at the extensive margin. Consequently, for this part of the analysis we <lb/>complete the initial database by generating the &quot; missing &quot; data. Because we are dealing with trade at <lb/>the HS-6 digit level, this greatly expands the dataset which reduces our ability to conduct some of the <lb/>estimations that are described below. <lb/>In addition to the export data, we collected data on each exporting country&apos;s GDP (measured in <lb/>current USD or in purchasing power parity exchange rates), each country&apos;s total labour force, its <lb/>agricultural labour force, its agricultural value added (AVA, measured in current USD or as a percent <lb/>of GDP), its fertilizer use, its arable land (measured as either as a percent of total area or hectares per <lb/>person), and its agricultural machinery. These data were obtained from the World Bank&apos;s World <lb/>Development Indicators except for agricultural labour force which were obtained from the FAO. <lb/>Unfortunately, data were not available for all countries and all variables in every year. Finally, data on <lb/>variables typically found in gravity models such as bilateral distance between country i and j, (one <lb/>measure of resistance to trade), as well as information on whether they share a common border <lb/>(contiguity), they have similar language, or shared colonial relationships were obtained from Centre <lb/>d&apos;Études Prospective et d&apos;Informations Internationals (CEPII). <lb/>Export data from COMTRADE are reported under different nomenclatures. The harmonised <lb/>system was chosen because it contains the most disaggregate product detail consistent across all <lb/>reporters. The original classification started in 1988. But, the system undergoes periodic updating, <lb/>changing product codes and description, probably to reflect changing product characteristics. This has <lb/>occurred in 1996, 2002, with the latest in 2007. Given the period of the analysis, (1996-2006), the HS <lb/>1996 nomenclature is the most appropriate providing a consistent set of data. However, many reporters <lb/>did not switch to the HS 1996 nomenclature until after 1996. Rather than comingling export data from <lb/>two different nomenclatures, 1996 export data are based on the HS 1988/92 nomenclature with <lb/>subsequent years based on HS 1996 nomenclature. 4 The changing nomenclature does not affect the <lb/>results when the intensive and extensive margins are calculated based on the HK methodology <lb/>(because they are based on cross sectional analysis). But, it does have implications for the results in <lb/>the later section which is based on changes over time. <lb/>Another point to remember about the trade data and the extensive margin is that the classification <lb/>at the 6-digit level may still be too aggregate to pick-up new products or quality differences and the <lb/>reader should bear this in mind when interpreting the results. Many countries use a finer <lb/>disaggregation to characterise their exported goods. 5 Thus, there are products that are traded but are <lb/>not picked up at the 6-digit level because they fall in categories where some trade is taking place, and <lb/>as stated above, may be one of the reasons for the changing nomenclature. The newly traded goods <lb/>that are observed in our dataset are those that shift from an implicit zero to a positive number either <lb/>because it is a new product or because it has found a new destination. Thus, this level of <lb/>disaggregation, systematically underestimates the importance of the newly traded goods (Amurgo-<lb/>Pacheco and Pierola). <lb/>4 <lb/>In some cases, countries made the switch even later. In order to maintain a consistent set of reporters <lb/>for the entire period, their export data were switched to the HS 1996 nomenclature when it became <lb/>available. <lb/></body>

			<body>Cross sectional results for the extensive and intensive margins <lb/>Results for all merchandise exports <lb/>Trade analysts have observed and international trade theory confirms that, ceteris paribus, larger <lb/>economies trade more than smaller economies. But, this empirical result can be explained via different <lb/>trade theories. That is, trade theories differ as to how larger economies trade more. One set of theories <lb/>based on national product differentiation, postulate that larger economies trade larger volumes of a <lb/>given set of goods while another strand, based on monopolistic competition, postulates that larger <lb/>economies trade a larger number of goods than smaller economies (HK). The question is, do larger <lb/>economies trade more at the intensive margin (more of a given set of goods as for example national <lb/>product differentiation such as Armington), or at the extensive margin (more goods as under <lb/>monopolistic competition models)? <lb/>HK address this question for overall trade using data from 1995. In this section we narrow down <lb/>the same question and focus on whether larger economies export more agricultural products at the <lb/>intensive or extensive margin. This section draws heavily on the HK methodology. HK utilize detailed <lb/>(HS-6 digit) UNCOMPTRADE data on exports to compute the margins in Equations 1 and 2 in 1995 <lb/>for 110 exporters to 59 partners to answer this question for total merchandise trade. They verify the <lb/>robustness of their results using US trade data at the HS-10 digit level. Here we use their methodology <lb/>to decompose each country&apos;s exports into the product of the extensive and intensive margins in order <lb/>to answer the question: do countries that export more, ship larger volumes of their goods 6 (intensive <lb/>margin), or do they ship a larger set of goods to more markets (extensive market)? In addition, we <lb/>decompose the intensive margin into price and quantity components to evaluate whether more exports <lb/>correspond to more units, or higher priced units. <lb/>In this section, utilising the definition of the intensive and extensive margin (equations 1 and 2), <lb/>we answer the question: by how much agricultural exports increase as a result of changes in economic <lb/>size, labour force or average productivity, and, of this, how much is at the extensive relative to the <lb/>intensive margin? Furthermore, following HK, we are able to distinguish how much of the growth in <lb/>the intensive margin for larger economies is due to changes in export prices relative to changes in the <lb/>quantity exported. Note that this is not an exercise to describe the factors that determine trade, rather <lb/>to discriminate how exports and margins differ between countries with different levels of income or <lb/>workers. <lb/>In order to examine whether at the intensive margin larger economies export more as a result of <lb/>higher prices or higher quantities, following HK we calculate the Fisher ideal price, (FIEP j ) (and <lb/>quantity FIEQ j ) index for each exporter j with j = 1,2,..69. These are quality adjusted price and <lb/>quantity indexes. The essential idea is that a rise in the extensive margin is equivalent to a fall in price <lb/>(HK). <lb/>1/2 <lb/>* <lb/>1/2 <lb/>6 <lb/>The terms &quot; goods &quot; and &quot; products &quot; are used interchangeably in the report and they refer to exported <lb/>items as described at the HS-6 digit level. <lb/></body>

The <lb/>export price index summarises the extent to which an exporter&apos;s prices are high or low relative to other <lb/>prices in the same partner for the same product. <lb/>A Fisher ideal quantity index can also be calculated analogously to the price index above, but <lb/>since the intensive margin is the product of the price index times the quantity index, one can compute <lb/>the implicit quantity index as, <lb/>4) <lb/>FIEQ j = IM j /FIEP j <lb/>where FIEQ j is the Fisher Ideal Export Quantity index for country j. <lb/>Before presenting our results, we replicate HK Table 1 below as a basis for comparison. Each <lb/>row represents an estimated equation with overall exports, the intensive margin and the extensive <lb/>margin as the dependent variables. HK relate each margin for total merchandise trade to a country&apos;s <lb/>size, measured by its GDP as well as its components, workers and output per worker. HK used these <lb/>two specifications to estimate each equation using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). In the first <lb/>specification, economic size (Y j ) measured by GDP based on purchasing power parities is regressed <lb/>against each of the dependent variables with the results given in column one. The second specification <lb/>includes two independent variables; output per worker (Y j /L j ) and the number of workers (L j ) are used <lb/>to explain the variation in each dependent variable. Their results are rather good for such a simple <lb/>model. GDP explains 77% of the variation of a country&apos;s overall exports with an elasticity close to <lb/>one suggesting that an economy twice the size exports twice as much. The variation of the intensive <lb/>and extensive margins is also rather well explained by GDP explaining more than 60% of the <lb/>variation. Because OLS is a linear estimator, the coefficients of the intensive and extensive margin <lb/>sum to the coefficient of overall exports and one can compute the relative contribution of each margin <lb/>to the total (this is given below the estimated coefficient of each margin). The estimated elasticities <lb/>suggest that countries that are twice as large export about one-third more at the intensive margin with <lb/>two-thirds occurring at the extensive margin. That is, of the additional exports of larger countries most <lb/>of it is through exporting more goods to more countries. <lb/></body>

Their results clearly demonstrate the importance of the extensive margin in <lb/>explaining the larger exports of bigger and more productive countries. <lb/>Results for exports of agricultural products <lb/>HK&apos;s analysis was based on data for 1995. For our analysis, we attempted to generalise their <lb/>methodology to take a dynamic view by examining the margins over the 11 year period 1996 to 2006. <lb/>We pooled the data into a panel for the 69 exporters from 1996 to 2006. Using the same specification <lb/>as HK but applying them to the agricultural sector, the dependant variables were: a) total agricultural <lb/>exports, b) intensive margin, and c) extensive margin as given in equations 1 and 2. The explanatory <lb/>variables were an economy&apos;s agricultural value added (AVA j ) measured in USD, and its components, <lb/>AVA divided by the size of its agricultural labour force (AVA j /AL j ), a measure of average <lb/>productivity, and the size of the economy&apos;s agricultural labour force (AL j ). <lb/>Unfortunately, the results for the pooled data were insignificant and are not reported. But, for <lb/>each of the 11 years, estimates based on the cross sectional data were undertaken and these results <lb/>were robust suggesting that the decomposition of exports into the margins is more appropriate for <lb/>cross sectional analysis. To avoid clutter, while giving a sense of whether the relationship between the <lb/>intensive and extensive margin has remained constant over time, results are presented for each of three <lb/>years, 1996, 2000, and 2005 or 2006 (depending on data availability). These give an indication of <lb/>whether there has been a change in the magnitude of the estimated parameters over time. <lb/></body>

The results for agricultural value added per <lb/>worker and agricultural labour force are for 2005 because data for agricultural labour force at the time <lb/>of the analysis were not available for 2006. <lb/>Comparing our results for 1996 to those from HK for 1995 (Table 1), one notices that our <lb/>specification explains a smaller proportion of the variation of exports and the margins. Although the <lb/>coefficient of AVA is positive and significant, AVA does a fairly poor job, explaining only 11% of the <lb/>variation in agricultural exports. In addition, the response of agricultural exports to changes in AVA <lb/>(the elasticity) is about a fourth the size reported in HK for GDP and all exports. This implies that a <lb/>country with twice the agricultural value added exports about 25% more agricultural products. In <lb/>contrast, HK find that a country with twice the GDP exported twice as much. <lb/>Similarly, agricultural exports as a function of average agricultural labour productivity <lb/>(AVA/AL) and total agricultural labour force (AL) perform rather badly explaining only 10% of the <lb/>variation in agricultural exports in 1996. The results indicate that economies with twice the <lb/>agricultural output per worker (but with the same overall agricultural labour force) export 28% more <lb/>while those with twice the agricultural labour force (but with the same average productivity) export <lb/>20% more. These elasticities are considerably lower from those reported in HK. <lb/>All variables are in natural logs. AVAj is agricultural value added for exporter j; ALj is total <lb/>agricultural labor force in exporter j. Percentages describe the contribution of each margin to the <lb/>overall export elasticity. Results for agricultural value added per worker are for 2005 because data <lb/>for agricultural labor force not available for 2006 at time of the analysis. <lb/></body>

			<body>Turning our attention to the 1996 results for the extensive and intensive margins, it appears that <lb/>AVA or AVA/AL and AL are not highly correlated with the margins explaining a small part of the <lb/>variation. Furthermore, in each of the estimated equations, one of the explanatory variables is <lb/>statistically insignificant. Again, these results are in stark contrast to HK based on overall labour force <lb/>and output per worker. Concentrating on the results with AVA as the only explanatory variable (since <lb/>the other specification has insignificant parameters), they suggest that most (52%) of the additional <lb/>exporting done by economies with larger AVA occurs on the intensive margin (within each product-<lb/>market category) and 48% on the extensive margin (exporting more products to more countries). <lb/>Comparing this finding for agricultural exports with those in Table 1 for all products, suggests that <lb/>large agricultural economies tend to focus on exporting more of the same goods to the same partners <lb/>in contrast to the pattern for exports in general. <lb/>The rest of Table 2 reports the results for the years 2000 and 2006(05). The results indicate that <lb/>the explanatory power of the exogenous variables has improved considerably over the interval. The <lb/>ability to explain the variation in agricultural exports and each of the two margins has improved <lb/>relative to 1996, and all of the parameters in each of the estimated equations are significant at the 1% <lb/>level in 2006. It also appears that economies with larger AVA and AL improved their ability to export <lb/>agricultural products as the elasticity for each variable more than doubled compared to their 1996 <lb/>values. Thus, in 2006, economies with twice the AVA exported 53% more agricultural products. More <lb/>than half of the additional exports occurred at the intensive margin (exporting more of the same goods <lb/>to the same partners) with 47% occurring at the extensive margin (exporting more goods to more <lb/>partners). Thus, economies with larger agricultural sector (as measured by AVA) and larger <lb/>agricultural labour force (columns 1 and 4 Table 2) export more of their agricultural goods at the <lb/>intensive margin which is different from the results for overall exports which are dominated by <lb/>exporting at the extensive margin. Product innovation and developing new partners seems to be less <lb/>important to firms in countries with large AVA or AL. However, countries with high agricultural <lb/>output per worker (average productivity) seem to behave differently. Most (58%) of the additional <lb/>agricultural exports from countries with larger agricultural output per worker (but with the same <lb/>overall agricultural labour force) occurs at the extensive margin (exporting more products to more <lb/>markets). It seems that firms in these countries are more innovative, developing new products and <lb/>discovering more trading opportunities around the globe. <lb/>We attempted to expand the model by including additional sector specific variables such as <lb/>agricultural land supply (absolute as well as a share of the physical size of a country), arable land as a <lb/>share of agricultural land, fertilizer use, and the number of tractors as additional indicators of an <lb/>exporting country&apos;s ability to produce agricultural goods (and hence expand export supply). These <lb/>results are not reported because these variables proved to be insignificant in explaining agricultural <lb/>exports (and the margins). <lb/>Given the relatively poor performance of the estimated equations reported in Table 2 and <lb/>reflecting the fact that in recent years agricultural (as defined at the WTO) exports comprise products <lb/>that are further removed from the farm gate (processed and semi processed products), agricultural <lb/>specific variables may not (and the results above confirm) represent the best variables to explain <lb/>agricultural exports. Consequently, the equations were re-estimated using GDP and total labour force <lb/>as explanatory variables. The results are presented in Table 3. <lb/></body>

Furthermore, the estimated elasticity is <lb/>much larger and more stable over time. GDP is also a better explanatory variable with regard to the <lb/>intensive and extensive margin. Total labour force and output per unit of labour (columns 3 and 4) also <lb/>perform better than comparable estimations with agricultural labour force and agricultural output per <lb/>unit of agricultural labour. These results suggest that agricultural trade, as it&apos;s increasingly dominated <lb/>by processed products, is more like trade in manufactured products and is more dependent on general <lb/>economic variables rather than sector specific. <lb/>Focusing on the results with GDP as the explanatory variable (Table 3 column 1), the value of <lb/>agricultural exports for economies with twice the income is 70% more with the results from the <lb/>extensive and intensive margin indicating that most of the additional exports occur on the extensive <lb/>margin (more goods to more markets). This is interesting because it is similar to the results from HK <lb/>but directly opposite to the results presented in Table 2 and in the next sections. These results suggest <lb/>that firms exporting agricultural products from rich economies without necessarily large agricultural <lb/>value-added, behave similarly to firms exporting all other products. Or, it may be that agricultural <lb/>products are not primarily exported by agricultural firms. For example, New Zealand&apos;s agricultural <lb/>goods are highly traded contributing a substantial portion to New Zealand&apos;s overall export revenue. <lb/>But, firm-level data from New Zealand indicate that most of the agricultural products exported from <lb/>All variables are in natural logs.

			<body>New Zealand are undertaken by firms that are in wholesaling or processing (Fabling and Sanderson <lb/>(2008). <lb/>It was mentioned above that there are alternative measures of the extensive margin. How do the <lb/>various measures illuminate the results? Table 4 reports the results of the various measures of the <lb/>extensive margin, for a three year interval 1996, 2000, and 2006. The first row for each year <lb/>reproduces the results for the extensive margin presented in Table 3. This is the count of the <lb/>combination of exported goods and markets, weighted by their share in world agricultural trade from <lb/>equation 2. The second row for each year reports the results when the extensive margin is computed as <lb/>a simple count of the combination of exported goods and markets to which the exporter ships. In terms <lb/>of equation 2, this equals the number of products in X jis for which x jis is greater than zero. This gives <lb/>an equal weight to all exported goods and markets regardless of their size. The results indicate that <lb/>larger economies ship a higher number of products to more markets, and, comparing row 2 to row 1, <lb/>the number of products-markets rises faster with GDP than the trade-weighted equivalent measure. <lb/>This finding is robust across time and suggests that firms in larger economies are more likely to export <lb/>to &quot; small &quot; product-markets, a finding consistent with that from HK for all trade. <lb/>The third row is based on calculations of the extensive margin based on products rather than <lb/>products and markets. In terms of equation 2, the decomposition based on the set X jis being replaced <lb/>by the set X js which is the set of products in category s in which x jis is positive for some importers. <lb/>This metric is based on the set of goods that firms in an economy export and not on the destination, <lb/>and is weighted by their importance in trade. That is, if two countries export the same number of <lb/>goods, they will have the same extensive margin in row 3, but if one of them exports to more markets, <lb/>it will have a higher extensive margin in row 1. <lb/>The extensive margin defined in terms of products accounts for 13% of the greater volume of <lb/>exports of larger economies in 1996, dropping to 10% in 2006. Comparing the first and third rows <lb/>around 30% of the extensive margin comes from exporting more agricultural products, while 70% <lb/>comes from shipping a given set of goods to additional destinations. The last row for each year in <lb/>Table 4 defines the extensive margin in terms of a simple count of the number of goods exported (the <lb/>number of elements in X js ), giving an equal weight to all exported products regardless of their <lb/>importance in trade. The results show that a country with twice the GDP exports anywhere from 21% <lb/>to 19% more goods (depending on the year). Comparing rows three and four, the number of goods <lb/>exported (row 4) rise faster with GDP than the number of products weighted by their importance in <lb/>trade (row 3), indicating that larger economies are more likely to export goods with &quot; small &quot; market <lb/>share. <lb/>The results for output per labor and total labour (columns 3 and 4) also reveal that the extensive <lb/>margin based on simple counts (whether of products and markets or only of products) rises faster than <lb/>their weighted counterparts suggesting that more productive countries for a given labour force, or <lb/>those with a larger labour force are more likely to export more products and to more product market <lb/>combinations that are relatively &quot; small &quot; . <lb/></body>

It seems that extensive margins based on the definition that excludes the impact of trading <lb/>partners (whether or not the measure is weighted by exports) are lower. This indicates that for <lb/>agricultural exports, discovering new partners may have a larger impact on agricultural exports <lb/>relative to developing a new product, a finding that is consistent with the finding in the next section. <lb/>Turning our attention to the intensive margin, are the additional agricultural exports of larger <lb/>economies of higher quality (do firms from rich countries receive higher prices) or do they export <lb/>larger volumes? The intensive margin is broken into its price and quantity components and results are <lb/>reported in Table 5. The results are not very satisfactory explaining very little of the variation in the <lb/>intensive margin suggesting that variables other than the price and quantity indexes are important in <lb/>explaining the intensive margin.

			<body>explanatory variable (column 1), both components of the intensive margin is statistically significant. <lb/>The results indicate that within the intensive margin (a country&apos;s share of world exports in those <lb/>products that it exports), countries with twice the GDP export 18% more goods at 15% higher prices. <lb/>That is, firms from richer economies are obtaining 18% higher prices for their goods compared to <lb/>firms exporting the same set of goods from other countries, and despite the higher prices, they also <lb/>export higher volumes. <lb/>Again focusing on the results for 2006 but for the second specification, the results in Table 5 <lb/>suggest that economies with twice the GDP per worker (but with the same level of total labour force) <lb/>obtain prices on the world market that are almost five times greater while countries with twice the <lb/>labour force (but with the same output per worker) receive prices that are 30% higher. On the other <lb/>hand, the insignificance of the quantity component indicates that the export volumes for economies <lb/>that are more productive or have a larger labour force are no different from those of other countries. <lb/>Table 5.

Although the estimated parameters were <lb/>somewhat different (the new methodology slightly lowered the share of the extensive margin), the <lb/>basic conclusion remained intact. Richer countries export more and most of their additional exports <lb/>are through the intensive margin. And, richer economies export higher volumes at somewhat higher <lb/>prices. <lb/>For completeness, we also employed HK&apos;s modified methodology to re-estimate the equations on <lb/>the data for 2006. Here we briefly summarise the results. 7 We find that the estimated parameters with <lb/>the modified methodology are somewhat different from those reported above, but they all remain <lb/>7 <lb/>Complete results available upon request. <lb/>All variables are in natural logs. GDPj is gross domestic product for exporter j measured in <lb/>purchasing power parities. Lj is total labor force in exporter j. Percentages describe the contribution <lb/>of each margin to the overall export elasticity. <lb/></body>

			<body>highly significant. The modified methodology reduces the contribution of the extensive margin on the <lb/>additional exports of larger economies. When size is measured by AVA, in 2006, the intensive margin <lb/>contributes 78% of the additional exports of larger agricultural economies (in contrast to 47% in Table <lb/>2). When GDP is the measure of economic size, the intensive margin contributes 56% of the additional <lb/>exports of richer countries (in contrast to 45% in Table 3). The relative contribution of price and <lb/>quantity to the intensive margin also changes somewhat. With the modified methodology, richer <lb/>economies export 29% higher quantities (compared to 15%) at 5% higher prices (compared to 18%). <lb/>These results indicate that the methodology used to calculate the margins plays an important role in <lb/>determining their relative share to total exports. The modified methodology removed the ambiguity on <lb/>the relative contribution of the extensive margin based on whether size is measured by AVA or GDP <lb/>as in both cases, the intensive margin contributes the larger share. This result is more consistent with <lb/>those presented below. But regardless of the methodology used to generate the results, the extensive <lb/>margin is a source of export growth and should not be ignored. <lb/>To summarize the results from this section, agricultural exports seem to respond to the same <lb/>general overall conditions in an economy as do exports from all other sectors. Agricultural sector <lb/>specific metrics do not seem to have the same explanatory power and the response of agricultural <lb/>exports to changes in those variables is smaller. The extensive margin for richer economies is mostly <lb/>from expanding the number of destinations rather than the number of products. This result is supported <lb/>by the findings in the next section and is similar to the findings in HK for all merchandize exports. It <lb/>also seems that after controlling for the level of the labour force, agricultural exports expand <lb/>considerably faster for the more productive economies, those with higher output per worker. <lb/>Looking at the three snapshots, 1996, 2000, and 2006, it seems that the importance of the <lb/>extensive margin for richer countries, although still comprising more than half of their larger exports, <lb/>has diminished with the intensive margin gaining importance. With the modified methodology from <lb/>HK(2005), the intensive margin contributes more than half of the additional exports of richer <lb/>countries. That is, richer economies are exporting more of the same products to their current partners, <lb/>a result which differs from total merchandise exports. <lb/>Finally, richer or more productive economies receive higher prices on the world market for the <lb/>agricultural products they export compared to other countries. The results from this analysis suggest <lb/>that in 2006, the export volume for countries with twice the income is 15% more (29% with the <lb/>modified methodology) than other countries and they receive prices that are 18% (5% with the <lb/>modified methodology) higher. The price premium is even more evident for the intensive margin of <lb/>countries that are more productive. <lb/>Even though its importance may have diminished, the extensive margin is a source for growth for <lb/>agricultural exports. Richer or more productive economies have the breadth to offer most of the <lb/>agricultural products traded on the world markets, and the depth to reach most destinations. But firms, <lb/>not countries, trade. The results therefore indicate that firms from larger economies have the <lb/>wherewithal to develop new products and the distribution skills to get those products to most <lb/>destinations. These firms are relatively more efficient than firms selling the same products from other <lb/>countries to sell small consignments to markets that import relatively few goods in small volumes, and <lb/>they have the development skills to produce and market higher quality goods enabling them to extract <lb/>higher prices for their products. <lb/>The results from this section may have implications on how to model agricultural trade. Models <lb/>that only focus on national product differentiation such as those based on Armington assumptions of <lb/>product differentiation do not include an extensive margin for export expansion and may understate <lb/>welfare gains from say additional liberalisation as they miss the gains from exports of new products to <lb/></body>

			<body>new partners (HK). This is a dilemma of these types of models, how to move from zero to positive <lb/>trade. <lb/>The extensive margin and its contribution to the growth of agricultural exports <lb/>The results from the section above decomposed a country&apos;s share of world exports into an <lb/>intensive and extensive margin in an attempt to discern differences between rich and poor countries. <lb/>This enables one to examine whether the value of exports of larger economies is higher for each good <lb/>they export (the intensive margin), and within the intensive margin, whether the higher value is due to <lb/>more volume or higher prices or whether richer countries trade a larger set of goods with more <lb/>partners (the extensive margin). This provided an indication of an economy&apos;s relative export <lb/>performance at a given point in time. The approach is less well suited (as indicated by the poor results <lb/>with the panel data) to address questions of the contribution of the extensive margin to the growth in <lb/>agricultural exports over a given time interval. <lb/>In this section, using the same set of 69 exporting countries, we provide information on how <lb/>agricultural exports have changed over the 11-year period, segregating the change into the intensive <lb/>and extensive margin. Here, rather than computing an indicator variable we utilise each trading <lb/>relationship for each of the 69 exporters to compute the change in their agricultural exports from 1996 <lb/>to 2006. This abstracts from the reasons for the change such as policy changes, supply shortfalls, or <lb/>population and income growth. In this section, the intensive margin is calculated by identifying the set <lb/>of commodities and partners that were exported at the beginning and ending periods and calculating <lb/>the change in the exported value. The extensive margin is calculated by identifying new products that <lb/>were exported at the end of the period which were not exported at the beginning regardless of whether <lb/>these new products were exported to totally new partners or to previously existing partners (new <lb/>products to new markets or to old markets), plus identifying old products (those that existed in the <lb/>beginning period) but are exported to new partners in the end. Decomposing the total growth in <lb/>exports requires an additional category, products that were exported at the beginning of the period but <lb/>are no longer exported. These disappearing or dead products are included in the intensive margin by <lb/>Brenton and Newfarmer (2007), whereas they seem to be included in the extensive margin by <lb/>Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola (2008), and Felbermayr and Kohler (2006). Since our interest in the <lb/>extensive margin is the establishment of new trading relationships, we include the disappearing or <lb/>dead products in the intensive margin. <lb/>When describing the data we explained why we had to use two different nomenclatures for the <lb/>export data and stated that it did not make a difference to the results reported above. However, the <lb/>results in this section are influenced by this choice since we are linking the products that were traded <lb/>in the beginning period with those traded in the later period. This concordance should not affect the <lb/>results on overall growth, but probably affects the results for the extensive and intensive margin. As a <lb/>reminder, we made the decision in order to have a longer time horizon for the most countries in the <lb/>database. Since all countries in the dataset were treated similarly, the hope is that whatever biases were <lb/>introduced by the decision, they were not systematic but random across the various reporters and thus <lb/>not biasing the results in any particular way. Nonetheless, as already mentioned, trade data at the 6-<lb/>digit level probably underestimate the extensive margin. <lb/>World agricultural exports increased 56% during the 1996 to 2006 period 8 , with 91% of the <lb/>growth accounted for by the 69 countries in the database. The country with the largest overall increase <lb/>in agricultural exports was Brazil whose exports increased by around USD 22 billion followed by <lb/>8 <lb/>This is based on total exports excluding exports with missing quantity units. Agricultural exports <lb/>including data with missing quantities grew slightly higher (57%). <lb/></body>

			<body>Germany with an increase of close to USD 21 billion and Netherlands with an increase of some <lb/>USD 14 billion. Annex Table 2 contains the list of countries and the growth in their agricultural <lb/>exports listed in descending order of their overall increase. The table also shows the change in the <lb/>value of the various margins for each country. Notice that agricultural exports increased by <lb/>USD 10 billion or more for only seven countries, five of whom are OECD countries, while 26 <lb/>countries saw their agricultural exports expand by less than USD 1 billion. The gross intensive margin <lb/>reports the results for trade flows for products and partners that existed in both time periods. Germany <lb/>and the Netherlands had the largest gain in exporting existing products to current partners. For several <lb/>countries however, this flow was negative. Expired products column shows the value of the trade <lb/>flows that existed in the beginning period but not at the end. The difference between gross and expired <lb/>products is the net intensive margin or the intensive margin reported here. <lb/>The results from section 1 showed a relationship between a country&apos;s output per worker and its <lb/>agricultural exports. Figure 1 below illustrates. This is a scatter diagram showing the change in a <lb/>country&apos;s agricultural exports between 1996 and 2006 mapped against output per worker (average <lb/>productivity) in 2006. This shows that many of the countries in the sample are bunched around values <lb/>with low average productivity and relatively small increases in agricultural exports while countries <lb/>with relatively strong expansion in exports tend to have high average productivity (Brazil seems to be <lb/>an outlier). <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>The sample consists of 29 members of the OECD 9 , one high income non-OECD economy, six <lb/>least developed economies, and 33 other developing countries. Segregating the sample into the 29 <lb/>OECD countries from the other 40, the OECD countries captured 65% of the additional exports <lb/>confirming earlier results that richer economies export more. It may also be illuminating to aggregate <lb/>countries into various groupings to discern commonalities and differences across the various income <lb/>or other groupings. One possible grouping is to examine whether the agricultural export sector of <lb/>current members of the OECD are similar to or different from the group of five countries that are on <lb/>track to become new members (the applicants or APPL) from those five countries with enhanced <lb/>engagement (EE) the six LDCs and the other developing countries. 10 <lb/>Agricultural exports for the five applicant countries increased by USD 5.7 billion (2.5% of the <lb/>total increase) while the five enhanced engagement countries expanded their agricultural exports by <lb/>USD 44.2 billion (19% of the total), the six LDCs expanded their exports by USD 0.6 billion (0.25%) <lb/>and the remaining countries expanded their exports by USD 29.6 billion (13% of the total) (Table 6). <lb/>How is the change in agricultural exports divided between the intensive and extensive margins <lb/>and does it differ for countries in different groups? Overall, 52% of the growth in agricultural exports <lb/>is at the intensive margin meaning that the growth has occurred through increased trade in already <lb/>established relationships. Other researchers examining the growth in overall trade among the intensive <lb/>and extensive margin confirm that most of the growth is at the intensive margin (Brenton and <lb/>Newfarmer (2007), Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008), and Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola <lb/>(2008)). But the results also indicate that not an inconsequential 48% of the growth is at the extensive <lb/>margin, that is, as a result of new trading arrangements, either through new products to established <lb/>partners or new products to new partners or through established products to new partners. <lb/>This finding is consistent with some of the findings from the previous section (based on the <lb/>modified HK (2005) methodology or size based on AVA with the HK (2002) methodology) but <lb/>somewhat at odds with other findings from the first section where the results indicated that most of <lb/>the additional agricultural exports of richer (based on GDP) countries are through the extensive <lb/>margin. These two findings may not be contradictory however. The results in the first section are <lb/>based on the analysis of whether in a given year additional exports of large countries occur at the <lb/>extensive or intensive margin. The results from the first section indicate that larger economies have <lb/>larger extensive margins because they are more likely to export to &quot; smaller &quot; economies and in <lb/> &quot; smaller &quot; product categories. In this section, the analysis is based on the total growth in exports <lb/>between two points in time and then disentangled the contribution of each margin to the total. Exports <lb/>to &quot; smaller &quot; economies in &quot; smaller &quot; product categories are not likely to contribute to large increases in <lb/>exports since they are &quot; small &quot; . In both cases however, the results indicate that new trading <lb/>relationships are important as evidenced by the fact that they account for almost half of the growth in <lb/>agricultural exports. <lb/>Interestingly, this average result differs considerably among the various countries (Annex <lb/>Table 2). For many countries, the extensive margin contributes less than half of the growth in their <lb/>exports. In Mexico&apos;s case, the extensive margin contributed only 7% to the overall growth in exports, <lb/>probably because of Mexico&apos;s reliance on exporting to NAFTA partners, Canada and the US.

			<body>other extreme, the extensive margin was the only source for growth in many countries, contributing <lb/>more than 100% of the growth because the value of the trade of their existing trading relationships <lb/>declined, that is, the intensive margin was negative. <lb/>For the six LDCs, the growth of their agricultural exports over this time interval came exclusively <lb/>from the extensive margin (Table 6). Trading new products to new partners added some <lb/>USD 1.1 billion in new export earnings. But, the intensive margin for the LDCs rather than adding to <lb/>their export growth, subtracted from it. For this group of countries, the growth at the intensive margin <lb/>was a negative USD .5 billion meaning that they sold half a billion less of their existing products to <lb/>their established partners. It seems that firms in these six LDCs have been able to diversify their <lb/>agricultural export basket offering more products to more partners. <lb/>The extensive margin is also important to the countries that are applicants for OECD <lb/>membership, on average contributing almost 70% to their additional exports (Table 6). Again, there is <lb/>large variation among the countries in this group (Annex Table 2) with Israel on the one extreme with <lb/>all of its additional exports coming via the extensive margin, and Chile on the other extreme with only <lb/>47% of her additional exports coming via the extensive margin. The 24 countries that do not belong to <lb/>any of the groupings also expanded most of their exports through the extensive margin, which is, <lb/>exporting new products to new partners and/or exporting old products to new partners. As shown in <lb/>Table 6, on average, 65% of their additional exports were generated by the extensive margin. The data <lb/>suggest that the exporting firms in the larger developing and least developed countries are pursuing an <lb/>export diversification strategy, expanding their exports to new markets and enlarging their export <lb/>basket , that is, by the extensive margin. <lb/>In contrast, the extensive margin has contributed somewhat smaller portion to the growing <lb/>agricultural exports of the enhanced engagement countries. Half of their export growth occurred at the <lb/>extensive margin, trading more goods with more partners and half came through the intensive margin <lb/>exploiting existing trading relationships. For the OECD countries, the intensive margin is the most <lb/>important source of growth, accounting for 58% of the growth in agricultural exports. That is, OECD <lb/>countries were able to increase their exports by exploiting their established trading relationships, with <lb/>only 42% of their additional exports coming through exporting new goods to new partners. <lb/>Table 6. Breakdown of the Increase in Agricultural Export between the Extensive and Intensive Margin <lb/>(1996-2006) <lb/>Total Increase <lb/>(USD billion) <lb/>Extensive <lb/>(USD billion) <lb/>Gross <lb/>Intensive <lb/>(USD <lb/>billion) <lb/>Expired <lb/>Products <lb/>(USD <lb/>billion) <lb/>Net Intensive <lb/>(USD billion) <lb/>Share of <lb/>Extensive (%) <lb/>Applicants <lb/>5.7 <lb/>3.9 <lb/>3.3 <lb/>-1.5 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>69 <lb/>Enhanced <lb/>Engagement <lb/>44.2 <lb/>22.2 <lb/>29.9 <lb/>-7.9 <lb/>22.0 <lb/>50 <lb/>LDC-6 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>-0.03 <lb/>-0.5 <lb/>-0.5 <lb/>191 <lb/>OECD <lb/>148.7 <lb/>63.0 <lb/>131.1 <lb/>-45.5 <lb/>85.7 <lb/>42 <lb/>Others <lb/>29.6 <lb/>19.3 <lb/>18.2 <lb/>-7.9 <lb/>10.3 <lb/>65 <lb/>Perhaps this result is not surprising, given that enhanced engagement and OECD countries are <lb/>among the largest exporters of agricultural products, shipping to most destinations thereby exporting <lb/>most of the products to most of the countries already in 1996. The scope for further market <lb/>development is more limited for these countries. It may also be the case that many of the newer <lb/>trading relationships start out on a rather small scale as exporting firms gather market information and <lb/>expand sales slowly, thus, some of these new trading relationships may not be generating large <lb/>revenues. <lb/></body>

			<body>Turning our attention to changes in the intensive margin, Table 6 distinguishes between gross <lb/>intensive margin (change in export value of same products to the same markets which can be positive <lb/>or negative) and expired (or dead) products (trading relationships that no longer exist in 2006) to <lb/>calculate the net intensive margin reported above. The results in Table 6 indicate that expired trading <lb/>relationships are important, subtracting a hefty sum from the total. The data indicate that strictly <lb/>looking at the value of trade in old products to old destinations (gross intensive margin in Table 6) <lb/>they contributed some USD 182 billion to additional exports for the countries in the sample. But, <lb/>disappearing products and markets (the couplet of products and markets that expired after 1996) were <lb/>valued at more than USD 63 billion leading to the net intensive margin of USD 119 billion. <lb/>The results confirm that the extensive margin is important, contributing substantially to the <lb/>overall additional agricultural exports of the countries in our sample. Figure 2 shows the distribution <lb/>of the extensive margin for the countries in our sample. It shows that the extensive margin for 19 <lb/>countries (out of the 69) generated more than 90% of their additional exports, while it contributed <lb/>between 70% and 90% of the additional exports for an additional 10 countries. But, for 11 countries, <lb/>the contribution was less than 30% of the total. <lb/>Our results here differ from those of Brenton and Newfarmer (2007) and Amurgo-Pacheco and <lb/>Pierola (2008). Both of these reports find that the extensive margin is of lesser importance than the <lb/>intensive margin for developing countries. One reason for the differences may be the composition of <lb/>the sample countries (Brenton and Newfarmer include 99 developing countries). While there is <lb/>considerable overlap with the country coverage in this report with Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola <lb/>(2008) (they examine 24 countries) it is not clear how or whether they account for expired trade in <lb/>their definition of the margins. As shown in the table above, excluding expired trade when calculating <lb/>the intensive margin greatly enhances the contribution of the intensive margin to the overall growth. <lb/>And, if trade that no longer exists is excluded from calculating either margin, summing the two <lb/>margins will overstate the total change in exports. <lb/>Since total growth is the sum of the extensive and intensive margin, the flip side is that the <lb/>intensive margin is of lesser importance in generating additional foreign earnings for a large number of <lb/>countries. Additional growth is not just the result of exporting more of the same set of goods to the <lb/>same set of countries. This finding has a positive connotation in terms of evaluating policy reform and <lb/>welfare enhancements from those reforms. The results suggest that countries with high extensive <lb/>margins may be less susceptible to declining terms of trade. They are less concerned with the <lb/>possibility of lower prices in order to expand their exports as their export basket contains new goods <lb/>or are destined to new markets. The implication is also that developing countries may be more <lb/>diversified than previously thought. But, it may also mean that there are challenges to develop models <lb/>that include the extensive margin when attempting to analyse the implications of policy reform. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 2. Number of countries and the contribution of the extensive margin to the growth of their exports <lb/>As mentioned above, the extensive margin refers to establishing new trade flows through <lb/>developing new products and/or cultivating new trading partners or by expanding the trading <lb/>relationships with established partners. Within the extensive margin, which particular avenue has been <lb/>more successful in increasing a county&apos;s exports? We have decomposed the extensive margin into four <lb/>components to address this question. Type 1(NPND) extensive margin involves developing New <lb/>Products or lowering the trade costs of products that have not been exported previously and marketing <lb/>them to New Destinations. These are probably the most difficult trade flows for exporting firms in any <lb/>country to develop since they involve products and markets that are totally new and require upfront <lb/>investment to identify target consumers in unfamiliar markets. Type 2 (NPOD) extensive margin is <lb/>similar to Type 1 extensive margin, but the New Products are marketed to familiar destinations (Old <lb/>Destinations) in the sense that other exporting firms from the country of origin have exported Old <lb/>Products to these partners in the past. It&apos;s not clear a priori the difficulty of establishing these trade <lb/>flows. Although firms in the exporting country are familiar with the trading partners, the products are <lb/>new requiring a certain amount of investment in market development and identifying target <lb/>consumers. Type 3 (OPND) extensive margin involves extending the market reach of established <lb/>(Old) Products by exporting them to New Destinations. These trade flows are the flipside of Type 2 <lb/>flows. In this case, firms are selling Old Products and presumably have experience in marketing them, <lb/>but they are targeting unfamiliar, New Destinations. Type 4 (EPTD) extensive margin is similar to the <lb/>intensive margin in that it involves exports of old products to old destinations (but in order to make the <lb/>distinction these trade flows at the extensive margin are referred to as Existing Products to Traditional <lb/>Destinations). The distinction is that the intensive margin refers to trade flows that exist in both time <lb/>periods, whereas for the extensive margin, these are new trade flows. The trade flows in this <lb/>classification are new because the product-partner combination did not exist in the past even though <lb/>the exporter shipped these products to other destinations, and the partners imported other goods from <lb/>this particular exporter.. Since firms in the exporting country are familiar with the importing market <lb/>and they have marketed the products in the past to other destinations, these trade flows may be easier <lb/>to establish. 11 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">11 <lb/>Since we do not have access to firm level data and the relative costs of establishing new trade flows, <lb/>reference to ease or difficulty of marketing various products to various destinations refers to the <lb/>importance of the flows as revealed in their contribution to the overall extensive margin. <lb/></note>

			<body>Figure 3 reports the value of the extensive margin for all sampled countries from Appendix <lb/>Table 2, and discriminates the contribution of each type of extensive margin to the total (Annex <lb/>Table 3 reports the contribution of each type of extensive margin to the overall total for each exporter). <lb/>This shows that overall growth in trade at the extensive margin totalled USD 110 billion. Of this, new <lb/>flows with exports of Existing Products to Traditional Destinations (Type 4 EPTD) was the most <lb/>important while the smallest contribution came from Type 1 (NPND) extensive margin which is <lb/>establishing totally new trading relationships in both the product space and the destination space. <lb/>Figure 3. Decomposition of the extensive margin <lb/>Total <lb/>Extensive <lb/>Margin <lb/>USD 110 <lb/>billion <lb/>Type 2: <lb/>(NPOD) USD <lb/>44.8 billion <lb/>(41%) <lb/>Type 1: <lb/>(NPND) USD <lb/>0.7 billion <lb/>(0.7%) <lb/>Type 3: <lb/>(OPND) USD <lb/>6.7 billion <lb/>(6%) <lb/>Type 4: new <lb/>trade flows for <lb/>(EPTD) USD <lb/>57.4 billion <lb/>(52%) <lb/>NPND: New product, New Destination. NPOD: New product, Old Destination <lb/>OPND: Old product, New Destination. EPTD: Existing Product, Traditional Destination <lb/>What is striking about Figure 3 is that developing new trading partners either by exporting old or <lb/>established products, and even more so through developing new products, seems to be very difficult. <lb/>Exports through these two nodes generate about 7% of the total extensive margin. Further inquiry is <lb/>needed to identify reasons for the small contribution to the extensive margin from developing new <lb/>partners. The results suggest that establishing a beachhead in a new destination is difficult, probably <lb/>requiring large initial investments in cultivating, promoting, and targeting consumers in an unfamiliar <lb/>environment. The results from Type 2 extensive margin indicates that the small contribution is not <lb/>related to problems in marketing new products because when they&apos;re offered to established partners, <lb/>they generate 41% of the extensive margin. And, new trade flows with traditional partners (Type 4) <lb/>which involves offering products that are new for that partner (expanding the variety of the export <lb/>basket) in established partners has the largest share. This implies that firms that have established <lb/>beachheads in other countries are able to utilise their knowledge of the local market to sell more <lb/>products whether or not those products are New. In contrast, the establishment of new trading <lb/>relationships with new destinations pose special challenges for firms. These results, coupled with the <lb/>results of exporting at the intensive margin seem to suggest that once firms from the country of origin <lb/>are in a market, they can more readily expand exports. In contrast, developing new partners imposes <lb/>greater challenges. <lb/>Finally, does the country of origin play a role as to which of the four nodes is the largest <lb/>contributor new trade flows? Rather than discussing the results for each country (which are available <lb/>in Annex Table 3), results are provided for various country groupings, and are presented in Figure 4. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">OPND: Old product, New Destination. EPTD: Existing Product, Traditional Destination <lb/>In Figure 4, reading across a row shows the relative contribution of the various types of new trade <lb/>flows to the overall extensive margin for the group of countries. Reading down a column indicates the <lb/>relative importance of the various new trade flows for each group. The results suggest that a firm&apos;s <lb/>country of origin does not play a significant role in the ability of a firm to establish new trading <lb/>relationships with new partners (Type 1). In all cases, this is the least important generator of new trade <lb/>flows. New destinations generate relatively small trade for exporting firms whether they&apos;re exporting <lb/>new or old products. Firms located in OECD countries, or countries that are applicants to the OECD, <lb/>or in countries with enhanced engagement, exporting to new destinations generate 5% or less of the <lb/>total extensive margin which implies that 95% or more of the extensive margin is through exporting to <lb/>traditional or old destinations. Interestingly, firms located in the six LDCs or in the other developing <lb/>countries are relatively more successful in establishing trading relationships with new partners <lb/>contributing about 17% to the total extensive margin (Type 3 and Type 1). <lb/>Looking at the new product dimension, Figure 4 suggests that firms located in countries at the <lb/>opposite extreme of the income scale, OECD and the six LDCs are similar in their ability to market <lb/>new products, especially to their old destinations, with more than 50% of their exports at the extensive <lb/>margin generated through this mode (Type 2). Obviously, the magnitude of the trade flows is very <lb/>different, but it may be interesting to examine what traits enable this phenomenon and why firms <lb/>located in the other groupings are less successful. But it is new trade with traditional or old partners <lb/>that generates the most new trade flows for firms regardless of their country of origin. More than 90% <lb/>of the extensive margin for firms in OECD, applicants for membership to the OECD and enhanced <lb/>engagement countries is from Type 2 and Type 4 flows, while these flows contribute more than 80% <lb/>to the extensive margin for the firms in the other two groups. <lb/></note>

			<body>The extensive and intensive margins from gravity-type estimates <lb/>The process generating the results above is very data intensive and requires lining up the data to <lb/>identify existing, expiring and new trading relationships, providing an overview on the relative <lb/>contribution of the margins to the overall growth in agricultural exports. The approach, however, does <lb/>not examine how or why the trading relationships evolve as they do, nor does it provide any <lb/>theoretical underpinnings. Why do firms export the set of products and why and how do they maintain <lb/>existing relationships and how do they develop their new trading partners? As Amurgo-Pacheco and <lb/>Pierola (2008) point out, the &quot; new-new &quot; trade theory attempts to answer this question. <lb/>Implicit in the analysis of the extensive margin as defined in the section above is that there are <lb/>zero trade flows that are ignored by the trade data as typically reported. That is, either because a <lb/>product has not yet been developed or because trade costs are high, potential trading relationships do <lb/>not materialise. 12 Once the product is developed or trading costs fall however, a previously non <lb/>existing relationship evolves with positive trade flows. Essentially the question is why do zero trading <lb/>relationships become positive? This is the crux of the question for those researchers examining the <lb/>extensive margin without explicitly measuring it. Thus, the trade data is in fact censored with <lb/>unobserved zero values. 13 <lb/>Many of the researchers who try to correct the problem with zero trade, start with the theory of <lb/>the firm, postulating that firms will begin to export once they overcome the costs of entering foreign <lb/>markets. The formal model is not presented here, since it is well documented elsewhere. Interested <lb/>readers can consult the original Melitz (2003) article that lays out the framework or many other papers <lb/>that use the framework, including Helpman Melitz and Rubinstein (2008) or Amurgo-Pacheco and <lb/>Pierola (2008). One of the strengths of the framework is that although it is based on theory of the firm, <lb/>it does not require firm-level data for the empirical estimation. Since firm-level data across a large <lb/>spectrum of countries and time is not readily available, the ability to distil the information using the <lb/>more readily available trade data is a plus. The basic outcome of the formal model is to derive a <lb/>gravity-type equation. When estimating the equation, differences among researchers centres on what is <lb/>the better econometric technique to use while accounting for the zeros. They all conclude that OLS <lb/>estimates are not appropriate but differ on what method to use. Among the alternatives is the Poisson <lb/>Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood, and the Tobit, (both of which handle truncated or censored data), non-<lb/>linear least squares, or two-step Heckman. This includes estimating a Probit function in the first step to <lb/>determine the probability of a zero trading relationship switching to non-zero while the second step <lb/>estimates the bilateral trade flow equation conditional on the probability in the first step. <lb/>We use the Tobit 14 estimation techniques to examine the intensive and extensive margins for <lb/>agricultural trade. The Tobit is one of the most common estimation techniques used to deal with <lb/>12 <lb/>This abstract from the fact that some of the zero trade flows in the data may not be reported or because <lb/>some zeros may be missing values. <lb/>13 <lb/>These researchers also tend to criticise conventional estimates of trade flows with the conventional <lb/>gravity equation because these tend to ignore zero trade flows leading to biased results. Since it&apos;s not <lb/>the purpose of this paper to review alternative specifications or methods for estimating gravity <lb/>equations, these are not discussed. <lb/>14 <lb/>The Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) technique is another approach to estimating <lb/>models with censored data. Unlike the Tobit, the PPML generates consistent estimates in the presence <lb/>of heteroskedasticity (Armugo-Pacheco and Pierola 2008). Given our interest in the intensive and <lb/>extensive margins, we nevertheless employ the Tobit technique. Results from Armugo-Pacheco and <lb/>Pierola (2008) indicate this is not a serious problem. <lb/></body>

			<body>censored data. Given our interest in the intensive and extensive margin, the Tobit model was chosen <lb/>because it gives flexibility to disentangle what happens at both margins at the same time that it takes <lb/>into account the censoring structure of the data. The advantage of explicitly accounting for the zero <lb/>trade with the Tobit is that it naturally decomposes trade into the intensive and extensive margin with <lb/>the intensive margin determined from the part of the distribution with positive trade and the extensive <lb/>margin determined when the zero switches to non-zero. We also estimate the model with the Probit to <lb/>estimate the effect of the explanatory variables on the probability of trading (i.e. switching from non-<lb/>trade (zero) to trade) as a robustness check. <lb/>It should be pointed out that the results here are preliminary. Initially the possibility to include <lb/>tariff and other policy information in the estimation was explored but it was not successful due to data <lb/>problems. Although we could identify applied tariffs when there was a trading relationship, this was <lb/>not possible when there was no trade. Additional data work is needed to identify the appropriate tariff <lb/>in such cases. Feenstra and Kee (2007), and Debaere and Mostashari (2005) were able to obtain the <lb/>necessary data because they did not deal with the problem of zero trade while Dennis and Sheperd <lb/>(2007) were able to obtain the necessary data because, even though they explicitly dealt with zero <lb/>trade, their dataset included exports from many countries but to only one destination, (the EU). <lb/>Nonetheless, we present the results as an indication of overall findings and for comparisons with the <lb/>findings above. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply this method to agricultural trade. <lb/>For this part of the analysis, we needed to generate a square data matrix, that is, each product <lb/>from each exporter has potential destination all trading partners. There are more than 200 trading <lb/>partners in any one year in the dataset. In order to make the dataset somewhat manageable, we restrict <lb/>the set of partners only to the 69 exporters. Nonetheless, the dataset contains some 35 million records <lb/>(98% of these are zeros) 15 and is so large, that it was not computationally feasible to pool the data into <lb/>a panel dataset to estimate the model over the 11 years. Rather, as was the case for Armugo-Pacheco <lb/>and Pierola (2008) we resorted to estimating one equation for each exporter. But, because of <lb/>estimation problems we provide results for 53 exporters out of the sample of 69 countries (with 4 of <lb/>the 53 obtained by bootstrapping 16 ). For 16 exporters the Tobit maximum likelihood function did not <lb/>converge. <lb/>Main findings <lb/>The initial model took into account many of the gravity-type variables such as contiguity, <lb/>common language and colonial ties. All except the GDP and distance were insignificant in most cases <lb/>and therefore they were dropped in the final specification. Thus, for each exporter the estimated <lb/>equation was <lb/>15 <lb/>The magnitude of the zeros in the dataset is an indication of potential trading opportunities that have <lb/>not materialised. <lb/>16 <lb/>For these four countries (Brazil, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and South Africa), the model is <lb/>estimated 100 times using repeated random samples from five importing countries. Point estimates for <lb/>intensive and extensive margins are obtained as the means of the 100 replications, and the variation <lb/>around the mean is calculated as the standard deviation of the same replications. <lb/></body>

This creates problems when the observation is zero. Therefore, as others <lb/>have done, for example Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola (2008), we shift all trade values by one unit. <lb/>This changes the mean by one unit but does not affect the variance. <lb/>We estimated the model above using the Tobit technique in Stata. The estimated raw coefficients <lb/>from the Tobit do not have a particularly interesting economic meaning, because they are simply the <lb/>effect of the independent variable on the &quot; latent &quot; (unobservable) dependent variable. These results are <lb/>not reported. For interested readers they are available upon request. Our interest is in deriving from <lb/>these parameters the intensive and extensive margin. As reported in Berndt (1991) and in Amurgo-<lb/>Pacheco and Pierola (2008), McDonald and Moffitt (1980) developed a formula to compute marginal <lb/>effects from the estimated latent variables which have an economic interpretation. Their equation is. <lb/>6) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>E | <lb/>E | , <lb/>0 <lb/>Pr <lb/>0 <lb/>Pr <lb/>0 <lb/>E | , <lb/>0 <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>y x <lb/>y x y <lb/>y <lb/>y <lb/>yxy <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>&gt; <lb/>∂ <lb/>&gt; <lb/>= <lb/>&gt; <lb/>+ <lb/>&gt; <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>For our purposes, the equation shows the total effect on agricultural exports due to a change in say the <lb/>importing country&apos;s GDP. <lb/>The total effect is decomposed into two factors. The first part of the expression on the right hand <lb/>side represents the change in the value of expected or average exports for the goods already traded, <lb/>weighted by the probability that there is already positive trade (the intensive margin). The second part <lb/>of the expression is the change in the probability of exporting weighted by the expected value of the <lb/>products that are already traded (the extensive margin). The second part of the expression thus shows <lb/>the probability of exporting a more diversified basket of goods. The Stata software has a routine that <lb/>computes each of these marginal effects. The results are reported in Annex Table 4. <lb/>With a few exceptions, the coefficients are statistically significant (at the 99% confidence level) <lb/>and have the expected sign (the larger the GDP of the destination country the higher the level of trade <lb/>and the more diverse the export basket, while for partners that are further apart, trade between them is <lb/>lower and less diverse). The results also indicate that the marginal effects are higher for the intensive <lb/>margin than for extensive margin (see Annex Table 4). <lb/>Comparing our results for agricultural trade to those reported in Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola <lb/>(2008) for all trade, it appears that the results are comparable for the set of countries that are common <lb/>to both studies. The estimated marginal effects at the intensive and extensive margin for GDP and <lb/>distance in both cases are reasonably close with the marginal effects of GDP and distance on total <lb/>trade somewhat higher (in absolute value) compared to their effect on agricultural trade. 17 And the <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">17 <lb/>This finding is consistent with those reported from the cross section analysis. <lb/></note>

			<page>31 <lb/></page>

			<body>results from both studies suggest that the intensive margin is much bigger than the extensive margin in <lb/>almost all cases. <lb/>This result appears to contradict the results reported in Annex Table 2 and Figure 2 which show <lb/>that for many countries, the extensive margin is the larger contributor to the expanded agricultural <lb/>trade. This apparent contradiction may stem from the fact that the results above disaggregated the total <lb/>change in agricultural exports between the two periods into the intensive and extensive margin <lb/>whereas the estimated results from the export equation above show the effect of changes in the size of <lb/>the import market and distance on the intensive and extensive margin. Although consistent with some <lb/>of the findings from the first section above, the results in this section are not comparable to those <lb/>results because: 1) those estimates were based on total, not bilateral agricultural trade, 2) we were not <lb/>able to pool all the exporters together for these results, 3) the results in Table 3 are based on a different <lb/>definition of the extensive margin, and 4) the estimation ignored trade with zero values <lb/>As equation 6 above shows, the total effect on trade from a change in an exogenous variable, say <lb/>the partners GDP, is the sum of two effects (the intensive and extensive margin reported in Annex <lb/>Table 4). For example, a doubling of the GDP of importing countries increases Argentina&apos;s exports by <lb/>29%. Most of this increase is through Argentina exporting more of its existing agricultural products to <lb/>existing partners. Only 8% of the additional exports are in new goods and or to new partners. <lb/>Similarly, reducing transport or other trading frictions proxied by distance by 10% would increase <lb/>Argentina&apos;s exports by 5.5%. Again, most of this additional trade would be through Argentina <lb/>exporting more of the same set of goods to the same partners (the intensive margin). Only 7% of the <lb/>additional exports would be through the extensive margin. The results for the remaining countries in <lb/>Annex Table 4 can be interpreted similarly. <lb/>Rather than discussing the results for each country individually, aggregated results for groups of <lb/>countries are discussed to highlight differences, if any, between OECD countries and others. <lb/>Unfortunately, because results for some of the applicant and LDC countries could not be estimated, <lb/>grouping the countries as in the previous section is not possible. Rather, we focus on the OECD <lb/>countries, those in the enhanced engagement group and the rest. The following table presents a <lb/>summary of the weighted (by the population) average marginal effect (similar results are obtained <lb/>when the average is weighted by the exporters GDP). <lb/>Table 7. Average marginal effects of a change in agricultural exports on the intensive and extensive <lb/>margin (from Tobit estimates) <lb/>Intensive Margin Extensive Margin Intensive Margin Extensive Margin <lb/>OECD <lb/>0.231 <lb/>0.049 <lb/>(0.450) <lb/>(0.081) <lb/>Enhanced <lb/>Engagement <lb/>0.176 <lb/>0.024 <lb/>(0.294) <lb/>(0.034) <lb/>Other <lb/>0.082 <lb/>0.005 <lb/>(0.292) <lb/>(0.008) <lb/>Partners GDP <lb/>Importer Distance <lb/>The results in Table 7 show that on average, the intensive margin is larger (absolute value), <lb/>contributing a larger percentage to the change of a country&apos;s exports in each group, and that trade <lb/>frictions (with distance as a proxy) between partners has a larger impact on trade than demand (with <lb/>GDP as a proxy). The marginal effects of both explanatory variables are larger for OECD members <lb/>compared to the other groupings. 18 For firms in the average OECD country, a doubling of the partner&apos;s <lb/>18 <lb/>This finding is similar to the finding above that richer countries export more at both margins. <lb/></body>

			<body>GDP leads to a 23% increase in additional exports of products that were already traded and a 5% <lb/>increase in the variety of the products exported whereas firms in the average enhanced engagement <lb/>country expand their &quot; old &quot; exports about 18% while expanding export varieties by 2%. The remaining <lb/>countries are on average even less responsive to changes in the income of their trading partner <lb/>expanding &quot; old &quot; exports by only 8% while exports in new products expand by barely 1%. It seems that <lb/>firms in OECD countries are on average better able to respond to changes in marketing opportunities <lb/>in export markets both by exporting more of the traditional products and by developing and offering <lb/>new products to their partners. And, their advantage is much more pronounced on the extensive <lb/>margin (offering new products) with an average marginal response more than double the response <lb/>from firms in other countries. <lb/>But, distance seems to have a bigger (in absolute value) affect on the exports from firms in <lb/>OECD countries. Firms in OECD countries tend to trade more intensively and offer a larger variety of <lb/>goods to partners that are closer. The further away a partner is located, the fewer the &quot; old &quot; exports and <lb/>the narrower the product range offered. In contrast, firms in enhanced engagement countries appear to <lb/>be less bothered by distance as indicated by smaller marginal effects reported in the table. The <lb/>marginal effect of distance on the intensive margin of agricultural exports is about equal for firms in <lb/>non-OECD economies. But for firms located in the &quot; Other &quot; group of countries, the negative effect of <lb/>distance is more than 3 times the positive effect of partners GDP. <lb/>Interestingly, exporting firms, no matter where they are located, seem to be more affected by the <lb/>costs of getting products to the market, compared to factors that affect the demand for their product. <lb/>Turning our attention to the extensive margin, the results in Annex Table 4 (for the individual <lb/>countries) and Table 7 for the various groupings indicates that the effect is very small. And, in most <lb/>cases, distance is a larger detriment to expanding the variety of goods exported and the number of <lb/>trading partners. It appears that cost factors as proxied by distance have a larger effect on the <lb/>probability of converting a non-existing trade flow into a positive one than do demand factors as <lb/>proxied by GDP. <lb/>Finally, equation 5 was estimated using the Probit estimation technique in Stata. But, rather than <lb/>estimating the value of exports, in this case, the dependent variable is whether or not there is trade. <lb/>That is, the value of trade was converted into a zero one variable taking on the value of one when there <lb/>is trade for that particular trading partner for that HS-6 digit product. This focuses strictly on the <lb/>extensive margin as it gives the probability of a zero value switching to positive number (or not), i.e. <lb/>increase (or not) in diversification. There are more countries included in the results as convergence <lb/>was a lesser problem with the Probit. The results reported in Annex Table 5 confirm previous findings. <lb/>The probability that trade increases at the extensive margin, (a non existing trade flow materializing) <lb/>increases with the partners GDP and decreases with distance. The estimated marginal effects are of <lb/>similar magnitude and sign as the corresponding Tobit estimation. The marginal effects are mostly <lb/>statistically significant but the effects are rather small, again consistent with the Tobit results and as <lb/>was the case for the Tobit, the relative effect of distance is larger (in absolute value) than the income <lb/>effect. <lb/>For an easier comparison of the results with the Tobit estimation (Table 7), Table 8 reports the <lb/>marginal effects (at the sample mean) of the Probit estimation, weighted (by the population) (similar <lb/>results when the average is weighted by the exporters GDP). Comparing the two tables the results of <lb/>changes in trade flows at the extensive margin are strikingly similar. Firms in OECD countries have a <lb/>greater probability of establishing new trading relationships (either through exporting new products <lb/>agricultural products to new or old markets, or through exporting old products to new markets), <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>compared to firms located in other countries. But, that probability is fairly small and it is even smaller <lb/>for firms in non-OECD economies. <lb/>Table 8. Average marginal effects of a change in agricultural exports at the extensive margin (from Probit <lb/>estimates) <lb/>Partner GDP <lb/>Importer Distance <lb/>OECD <lb/>0.045 <lb/>(0.087) <lb/>Enhanced <lb/>engagement <lb/>0.022 <lb/>(0.041) <lb/>Other <lb/>0.002 <lb/>(0.006) <lb/>Summary and conclusions <lb/>Trade occurs because the parties that engage in the transaction find it beneficial. On the import <lb/>side, welfare is enhanced through consumption of lower priced goods and through the availability of a <lb/>larger variety of goods. On the export side, expanding markets enables the exploitation of comparative <lb/>advantage, while firms can reduce costs by increasing the scale of their production and improve <lb/>productivity. Exports can grow as firms export more and/or at higher prices for the products they have <lb/>been producing to their existing partners (the intensive margin). Exports can also grow through market <lb/>development and by exporting existing set of products to new partners and through innovation and <lb/>exporting new products either to existing or to new partners (the extensive margin). Of course, exports <lb/>can also diminish as demand for certain products on world markets falls or the goods are replaced by <lb/>exports from more efficient competitors from other countries. <lb/>In this paper the evolution of agricultural exports between 1996 and 2006 was examined to <lb/>ascertain the relative contribution of the extensive and intensive margin. The intensive and extensive <lb/>margins have been defined differently by various researches. In this exercise, several different <lb/>definitions have been used to ascertain the effects on trade in agricultural products. <lb/>The extensive margin has contributed to growing agricultural exports, more for firms located in <lb/>OECD countries relative to those in other countries. Supply factors are important explanatory <lb/>variables to export expansion. But, agricultural specific variables such as agricultural value added, the <lb/>supply of farm labor, average agricultural labor productivity, and the capital intensity of agriculture <lb/>performed inferior to general economic variables such as GDP, total supply of labor and average labor <lb/>productivity. This may be a reflection of the time period examined and/or the countries chosen in our <lb/>sample, although most likely it is a reflection that more and more, agricultural trade is in products that <lb/>are further removed from the farm gate encompassing more value added and is undertaken by firms <lb/>that are removed from the agricultural sector. Recent evidence from New Zealand, a country with a <lb/>substantial share of agricultural goods in its total trade, indicates that this may the case as most of the <lb/>exports of agricultural goods are by firms outside of the agricultural sector. This may indicate that <lb/>agricultural trade is similar to trade in other products influenced by general economic conditions rather <lb/>than sector specific. <lb/>Using a particular definition of the intensive and extensive margin developed by Hummels and <lb/>Klenow (2002), which is a relative concept and depends on depth and breadth of an exporting <lb/>country&apos;s product offering and trading partners in a given year, the results suggest that richer <lb/>economies tend to have more diversified export bundles. In 2006, 55% of the additional exports of <lb/>richer (based on GDP) countries were through exporting more products to more partners. Firms in <lb/>larger economies have the capacity to sell to more markets that may not necessarily be very large <lb/></body>

			<page>34 <lb/></page>

			<body>overall importers, and they can export more products that may not necessarily have very large value, <lb/>that is, they are able to export relatively small consignments to relatively &quot; small &quot; markets. The <lb/>extensive margin is an even larger contributor to overall exports for economies with a more productive <lb/>labour force. However the results from this part of the analysis also show that the importance of the <lb/>extensive margin in agricultural exports has declined over the time period examined. At the intensive <lb/>margin, the results indicate that not only is the volume of exports larger for richer economies but firms <lb/>are also able to obtain higher prices, suggesting that they&apos;re offering higher quality goods. Firms in <lb/>countries with higher average productivity or with larger labour force are also able to command higher <lb/>prices, but the volume exported is not necessarily higher. However, when an economy&apos;s size is <lb/>measured by its AVA, or when the margins are calculated by Hummels and Klenow&apos;s (2005) modified <lb/>methodology, the results indicate that it&apos;s the intensive margin that contributes the larger share of the <lb/>additional exports of larger economies. <lb/>The descriptive portion of the analysis examined the growth in agricultural exports from 1996 to <lb/>2006 without attributing the reasons for this growth. The findings indicate that for the countries in the <lb/>sample, more than one-half of the growth in their exports occurred through the intensive margin. But, <lb/>for many countries (44 out of 69) in the sample, the extensive margin accounts for more than half of <lb/>the growth in their exports over this time period. This indicates that the intensive margin was a larger <lb/>contributor to the growth of the exporting countries with large gains. Most of the countries growing at <lb/>the extensive margin are non-OECD countries, indicating that developing countries are diversifying <lb/>their agricultural export profile. Decomposition of the extensive margin indicates that the vast majority <lb/>of the new exports are from exporting to traditional destinations which implies that establishing <lb/>trading relationships with new destinations is costly. Only about 7% of the new exports are to new <lb/>destinations. <lb/>But, when the change in agricultural exports and the intensive and extensive margins were <lb/>analyzed by estimating a gravity-type equation while explicitly accounting for zero trade flows, <lb/>preliminary results suggest that factors affecting the cost of exporting (using distance as a proxy in our <lb/>case), have a bigger (absolute value) effect on bilateral export flows compared to factors that affect <lb/>demand (using importing country&apos;s GDP as a proxy). We also find that additional agricultural exports <lb/>are mostly generated by changes on the intensive margin, with the extensive margin providing a <lb/>statistically significant but economically smaller share. One should remember however that our <lb/>measure of the extensive margin probably understates its prevalence. Even though we use the most <lb/>disaggregate trade that is internationally consistent (HS-6), there are probably cases where trade in <lb/>new products is not picked up at the HS-6 digit level because they fall in categories where some trade <lb/>is taking place and are classified under existing categories. <lb/>Looking at the extensive margin, there are boundless trading opportunities waiting to be <lb/>exploited. For agricultural products, the number of dormant bilateral relationships dwarfs the number <lb/>of active ones. Although there may be good reasons for the dormant relationships many of which are <lb/>not explored in this study, policies that reduce trade frictions and expand global income can reduce <lb/>their prevalence. <lb/>The fact that the extensive margin is an important source of growing agricultural exports has <lb/>implications on modeling trade reform. Models that are not capturing this source of growth will <lb/>underestimate the potentialimpacts. For exporting countries, they may be less vulnerable to <lb/>deteriorating terms of trade if they&apos;re exporting &quot; new &quot; products or if they&apos;re exporting higher quality <lb/>products. For importing countries, the welfare gains from an enlarged basket of goods may be <lb/>understated. <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>The preliminary results also highlight the importance of trade resistance or trade costs on the <lb/>existing trade flows and on the probability of forming new trading relationships. It seems that there is <lb/>a large payoff to policies that can reduce those frictions. In this analysis, distance was used to proxy <lb/>these trading costs. Further efforts to explicitly include trading costs, such as tariffs, standards, <lb/>information costs or infrastructural impediments into the analysis may improve our understanding of <lb/>their effects on trade flows at the intensive and extensive margins. More detailed analysis at the <lb/>individual product level may also help illuminate the characteristics of those innovative products that <lb/>develop (or not) into major trade flows. <lb/></body>
