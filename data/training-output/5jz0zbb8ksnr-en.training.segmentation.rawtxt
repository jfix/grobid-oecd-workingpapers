stocks of shale oil and gas. The resurgence in oil and gas production is beginning to create discernible 
economic impacts and has changed the landscape for natural gas prices in the United States, boosting 
competitiveness. In order to reap the benefits fully, significant investment is needed. Federal and state 
governments capture some of the resource rents, but there are potential opportunities to increase taxation 
and use the revenues to support future well-being. Taxing natural resource rents with profit taxes can be 
less distortionary than other forms of taxation, though only one state uses this form of tax. Production of 
shale resources, like other forms of resource extraction, poses a number of challenges for the environment. 
Respecting demands on water resources requires adequate water rights are in place while state and federal 
regulators need to monitor the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing closely and strengthen 
regulations as needed. Natural gas is a potential  " bridge fuel "  towards a lower carbon economy, helping to 
reduce emissions by leading to a substitution away from coal. Flanking measures are desirable to counter 
natural gas hindering renewables and low prices stymieing innovation. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of United States

« renaissance énergétique » grâce à ses abondantes réserves de pétrole et de gaz de schiste. Le nouvel essor 
de la production pétrolière et gazière commence à avoir des effets économiques perceptibles et a changé la 
situation des prix de l'énergie aux États-Unis, stimulant la compétitivité. Pour tirer pleinement parti de 
cette évolution, il faudra des investissements significatifs. Le gouvernement fédéral et les États devraient 
capter une partie de la rente des ressources naturelles et mettre ces recettes au service de l'amélioration du 
bien-être futur. Alors que la taxation des rentes de ressources via l'impôt sur les bénéfices peut être moins 
distorsive que d'autres formes de fiscalité, seul un État y a recours. La production de pétrole et de gaz de 
schiste s'accompagne d'un certain nombre de défis environnementaux. Pour respecter les demandes 
d'utilisation des ressources en eau, il faut veiller à l'existence de droits sur l'eau appropriés, et les autorités 
chargées de la réglementation au niveau fédéral et à celui des États doivent surveiller de près les 
répercussions environnementales de la fracturation hydraulique et renforcer la réglementation autant que 
nécessaire. Le gaz naturel peut être une « énergie relais » dans la transition vers une économie sobre en 
carbone et contribuer à réduire les émissions en entraînant le remplacement du charbon. En l'absence 
d'une action concertée, il y a toutefois un risque que le marché de l'énergie se reporte de nouveau sur le 
charbon en cas d'épuisement des réserves de gaz naturel ou de modification des prix relatifs. Des mesures 
d'accompagnement seraient souhaitables pour éviter que le gaz naturel freine le développement des 
énergies renouvelables et que la faiblesse des prix paralyse l'innovation. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l'Étude économique de l'OCDE de États-Unis 2014

environmental services for economic production -and economic growth has been punctuated by periods of 
their rapid exploitation, such as for gold and other metal ores, minerals and coal, oil and gas. Since around 
2007, the country has been enjoying an  " energy renaissance "  thanks to its abundant stocks of shale oil and 
gas being made accessible by the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies. 
The renaissance has revived production of oil and natural gas and is creating economic benefits. At the 
same time, exploiting natural capital raises issues about how to make sure that the environmental impacts 
and safety concerns are taken into consideration (i.e. internalise associated environmental externalities) and 
ensure that longer-term sustainability, both of wealth and the environment, is taken into consideration. This 
chapter, examining the recent upswing in oil and gas production, considers the policies that help capture 
the full economic and environmental benefits while addressing externalities and longer-term sustainability. The next section describes the resource endowment in the United States and how shale oil and gas 
have changed the picture for the energy sector. The next section discusses the economic benefits which 
may emerge as a result of increased oil and gas production. The following section assesses how the rents 
from the sector are being distributed and how taxation of the sector is implemented. This is followed by a 
discussion of the local impacts of hydraulic fracturing and the regulatory challenge they create. The final 
section then discusses the contribution natural gas could make to climate change mitigation and the 
challenges it may pose moving towards an even lower carbon economy. The United States is well endowed with natural resources Natural capital represents a relatively small share of the overall wealth in the United States, which is 
dominated by intangibles or human (and health) capital (Arrow et al.2012). However, on a per capita basis, 
calculations for the early 2000s still rank the United States 11 th in the world according to the abundance of 
natural capital and 15th in respect to sub-soil mineral resources (World Bank, 2006). Only a few OECD 
countries have large shares of natural resources as a share of total wealth, which in the case of Norway 
arises due to their ample off-shore hydrocarbon reserves. Japan, on the other hand, has very few natural 
resources and its wealth is derived from human capital and produced (physical) capital. 1. Economics Department, OECD. This paper was originally prepared for the OECD Economic

Information Administration markedly increased its estimates of oil and gas reserves (Figure 2.1). Shale gas 
proved reserves -those reserves with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under 
existing economic and operating conditions -have risen more than fivefold between 2007 and 2011 and 
now account for 40% of total gas reserves in the United States. In the case of oil, shale oil (often referred to 
as  " tight oil " ) proved reserves have also risen, though less spectacularly, and these deposits now account 
for around 10% of total oil proved reserves. Forecasts suggest that production of shale gas will continue to 
grow strongly till at least 2040 when it will account for one half of natural gas produced in the 
United States (EIA, 2013). President Obama in his 2012 State of the Union address noted that recoverable 
resources may last as long as 100 years at current production levels. At present, not all recoverable 
resources would be commercially viable to extract, but in the longer term as energy prices rise and/or 
technological innovation reduce extraction costs a greater share of these resources could be extracted. The 
picture for production of shale oil is similar, but with total oil production peaking before 2030 and then 
declining. Natural capital in the United States has been boosted by rises in estimates of proved reserves of shale 
oil and shale gas. Using a methodology developed by the World Bank to estimate natural wealth gives 
some indication of the potential changes arising from these developments. By this measure, oil and gas 
wealth in the United States grew from around 16% of GNI in 2000 to over 30% of GNI in 2008, just when 
the shale boom was beginning to take off (Table 1). Assuming the boost to reserves extends the resource 
life, the expansion of shale oil and shale oil production could lift wealth derived from oil and gas 
substantially. While more recent information on production costs is unavailable, using the latest available 
figure to estimate the rents suggests that the natural wealth due to gas has fallen somewhat, partly as a 
result of the falling natural gas prices in the United States (see below), whereas the wealth due to crude oil 
rose further. The impact of shale oil and gas development has seen the gradual fall in crude oil production reversed 
and the production of natural gas pick up. Between 2008 -when production hit its recent low -and 2013 
crude oil production has surged, rising by almost 50%. Over the same period, the production of natural gas 
has risen almost 20%, with shale gas production more than tripling and offsetting declines in conventional 
natural gas production from other sources. Figure 1.

11 305 Note: Estimates of oil and gas wealth are based on the methodology used in World Bank (2006). This methodology makes a number 
of simplifying assumptions to calculate the resource rent. These include setting the assumed resource life of the deposit and 
estimating of production costs for oil and gas. The calculation of wealth is then based on these parameters and production 
levels. The table in the first two columns reproduces the estimates of oil and gas wealth for 2000 and 2008 using this 
methodology. In order to explore the possible impact of more abundant oil and gas resources, the third column reports 
estimates of wealth when the assumed resource life if doubled. The impact of price changes between 2008 and 2012 is 
reported in the fourth column. Source: calculations based on World Bank, EIA, Census Bureau and BEA data. The oil and gas boom has boosted the fortunes of a number of states and invigorated companies 
working in the sector. The distribution of shale gas deposits across the country is quite widespread, though 
the proved reserves are predominantly located in a handful of states, which is also where large-scale shale 
gas production (these areas are often called  " plays " ) is located (Figure 2). The shale oil deposits are 
predominately located in Texas, North and South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and 
Wyoming. Whilst energy stocks have tracked the recovery of stock market indices following the crisis, the 
relatively small scale of hydraulic fracturing wells has led to a substantial inflow of independent companies 
into drilling and supporting services. As a consequence, the major integrated energy companies have had a 
less dominant role in the energy renaissance as it got underway, but have increasingly moved into this area. Figure 2.

boosting employment in the sector and exports of natural gas and (particularly) refined products (Figure 3). 
Other economic benefits are likely to arise as new production serves as a cushion to price volatility. The 
direct effects of the oil and gas mining sector on growth have been relatively modest, boosting GDP 
growth by on average by around 0.15 percentage points since the pick-up in energy production began in 
2007. However, BEA data on value-added of the oil and gas mining industry show that the sector has 
picked up dramatically in 2011 and 2012 when the real growth rate of value added in the oil and gas 
mining sector rose to 7% and then 18%, accounting for 0.23 and 0.35 percentage points of overall GDP 
growth during these years, respectively. In addition, there are indirect upstream and downstream effects on 
GDP that are not included in these estimates. The boom in shale oil and gas has contributed to strong 
investment in structures in the oil and gas sector, with the growth rate in investment recording double digit 
rates and averaging 18% annual growth between 2010 and 2012. Employment in oil and gas mining 
remains relatively small, but rising strongly during the recovery from the crisis (Figure 3). Including 
support activities in the mining sector suggests that employment has been boosted by 300 000 between the 
nadir in employment in 2003 and 2013. Figure 3. The shale boom is boosting employment and net exports Source: US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the states with the largest shale gas production, the growth rate of the oil and gas mining sector has 
in some cases been spectacular, with Pennsylvania and North Dakota experiencing annual growth rates in 
the sector of over 30%, albeit from low initial levels (Figure 4). The effects are discernible in wage and 
employment developments in some states. The impact of the resource boom is especially apparent on wage 
growth. For example, according to BLS data, average weekly earnings in North Dakota are rising at a 7% 
rate since 2011, compared with the national average of around 2%. BLS data also show that gains in 
mining sector employment have contributed to sizable employment gains in a number of regions. A.

The oil and gas boom has depressed domestic energy prices The shale gas and oil boom has changed the landscape for energy prices in the United States. The 
relationships between international oil prices (Brent), domestic oil prices (WTI) and natural gas prices 
(Henry Hub) have weakened, with the tendency for these prices to move together becoming weaker after 
mid-2008, largely coinciding with the largely unanticipated rapid pick up in shale oil and gas production 
(Figure 5). The decoupling of natural gas from prices in Europe and Asia is particularly pronounced. The 
price of natural gas fell to as low as around one-quarter of natural gas prices in Europe and even less in the 
Asian market before rebounding somewhat. The low price of natural gas promoted a switch in exploration 
and production away from shale gas and towards shale oil. Lower domestic natural gas prices have 
supported natural gas exports and are boosting the potential competitiveness for natural gas intensive 
industry by reducing feedstock (mainly ethylene) prices, whereas other sectors benefit from cheaper energy 
prices. Given liquefaction, transportation and regasification costs, the wedge between domestic and 
international natural gas prices is likely to be persistent. Export of natural gas to countries without free-
trade agreements with the United States requires prior approval from the Department of Energy, for which 
there is an established authorisation process. The Administration should ensure that energy exports are 
promptly approved. Limited export-oriented infrastructure also currently constrains natural gas exports. 
Although more than 9 billion cubic feet per day of export facilities have been granted conditional permits 
from the Department of Energy and roughly 2 billion cubic feet per day have received final permits, LNG 
export facilities are massive and require years to construct. With the prospect of lower domestic energy 
prices, investment in pipelines and other transportation infrastructure, which are undertaken by the private 
sector, will be important to ensure the economy can reap the full benefits. -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 Michigan

BTU (British Thermal Units) Source: Bloomberg and International Energy Agency. In the oil sector, legal restrictions on crude oil exports in place since the 1970s do not prevent the 
exports of refined petroleum products. However, foreign sales may be limited to the extent that refining 
capacity and transportation infrastructure are insufficient to handle the available supply. The 
Administration is considering options under current law to allow exports of crude oil. Another approach 
would be to abolish the prohibition of crude oil exports altogether. Other sectors will benefit from the expansion of hydraulic fracturing through input-output linkages. 
The demand from the development of the shale gas and oil sector to other sectors is likely to be relatively 
weak. On the other hand lower energy costs can raise the competitiveness in energy intensive sectors, 
augmenting the impact of relatively modest growth in unit labour costs (Celasun et al., 2014). The impacts 
on energy-intensive sectors, such as chemicals, are currently limited (Goldman Sachs, 2013). To some 
extent, the lack of a consistent picture in industries most likely to benefit from low domestic energy prices 
is due to their capital-intensive nature. As new capacity takes time to construct the full impact on 
competitiveness will only become apparent over time. That said, recent data suggests that the low domestic 
energy prices are having an impact on exports. For example, Spencer et al. (2014) note that net exports in 
energy-intensive sectors more than doubled in value between 2006 and 2012 to USD 27 billion, though 
still only accounting for a small share of overall trade. While the effects outside the oil and gas mining 
sector have been relatively small so far, the potential for larger effects nonetheless exists (McKinsey, 
2013). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 BRENT (left axis)

hydraulic fracturing and drilling itself, pipelines and other transportation infrastructure, reorienting import 
terminals to export terminals and the expansion of energy-intensive industries that are likely to benefit 
from lower prices. Given the significant sunk costs and irreversibility associated with these investments, 
measures that reduce uncertainty support the development of transportation and associated infrastructure. 
In this context, a stable policy regime, including for climate change (see below), acquires some 
importance. As discussed below, the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing is not well understood, 
which creates uncertainty as to the likely regulatory response. In these circumstances, companies may 
adopt a wait-and-see strategy and delay investment while environmental agencies develop their 
regulations. The regulatory approach to the development of natural resources is likely to vary considerably 
across states, covering environmental standards as well as permitting and licensing. Rahm (2011) notes 
that the development of mineral rights in some states, such as Texas, is comparatively straightforward 
whereas in others areas, such as New York state and a number of localities, development is explicitly 
prohibited. The federal authorities become important regulators when resource development requires 
interstate transport, with pipelines requiring the approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. Who is capturing the benefits? The boom in oil and gas production is having significant effects in the states were the deposits are 
located. This raises two related issues. The first concerns how the gains from oil and gas exploitation are 
shared. The second is what happens after the oil and gas deposits are exhausted. In this context, 
governments by capturing some of the resource rent can address how to adjust once the resource boom has 
run its course. This could take the form of investing in education, including community colleges to help 
workers become more adaptable, funding research, financing productive infrastructure provision and 
establishing endowment funds and putting government finances on a better footing by paying down debt. 
In some senses, due to the fungibility of money, ensuring that policy avoids squandering the revenues is 
key to securing longer-term welfare. Natural resources confer natural rents, which is roughly the difference between the price at which the 
resource can be sold less the costs of exploitation and extraction or more formally the opportunity cost of 
holding the resource underground. Policy settings are important in determining which groups benefit most 
from the exploitation of natural resources, including future generations who stand to lose unless provisions 
ensure they also benefit. In competitive markets, the benefits of resource exploitation are shared among several parties. First, 
landowners benefit from owning the mineral rights through lease payments for their exploitation. Second, 
new gas and oil production has pushed down energy prices, particularly gas prices, benefitting consumers. 
In the oil sector, legal restrictions on crude oil exports in place since the 1970s do not prevent the exports 
of refined petroleum products. However, foreign sales may be limited to the extent that refining capacity 
and transportation infrastructure is insufficient to handle the available supply. For example, some refiners 
are better adapted to using heavier crude oil than the light oil typically produced by hydraulic fracturing. In 
this case, some of the possible resource rent obtainable for oil producers though exporting would be 
sacrificed were domestic light oil production to rise to the point where it exceeds domestic refiners' ability 
to easily absorb it. The Administration is considering options under current law to allow exports of crude 
oil. Another approach would be to abolish the prohibition of crude oil exports altogether. Taxation of shale oil and gas Federal and state governments may capture some of the resource rent through various taxes and use 
the revenues to support spending or funds that will raise future well-being. Taxing natural resource rents, if ECO/WKP(2014)43 12 done properly, can be less distortionary than other forms of taxation (Box 1.). A well-designed profit tax 
could reduce economic distortions which can discourage exploration and development. However, most 
governments rely on royalties and the rate applied can be relatively low. A few states have experienced a 
significant increase in revenues from resource related taxation (Table 2) and enjoyed a corresponding boost 
to spending (NASBO, 2013). Box 1. Taxation of non-renewable natural resources Profits derived from non-renewable resource extraction can be taxed while imposing relatively small distortions 
on the economy (Andrade de Sá and Daubanes, 2014). However, the form of taxation can influence the effort in 
exploration and development. While a number of options exist for taxing resources rents, in the United States, most 
governments rely on royalties (also known as severance taxes). Due to the split between federal and state tax 
authority, combinations state resource taxes and federal corporate income taxation are typical. Royalty taxes are based on the amount of oil and gas extracted. While relatively easy to collect they introduce a 
number of distortions. The tax can induce the firm to shut extracting the oil and gas earlier than is socially optimal. 
Secondly, the tax can reduce incentives to invest in exploration, although this can be mitigated partially by offering 
investment subsidies. Broadway and Keen (2008) point out that this may give incentives for state governments to levy 
higher severance tax rates than they otherwise would if the royalties are deductible against federal corporate income 
tax. The range of rates levied across the states suggests that this is not an overriding concern. Profit taxation is 
another approach (implemented in Alaska in combination with a royalty tax), which is intended to capture a share of 
profits arising from the resource rent. In this approach a tax is levied on all real transactions on a cash flow basis. The 
government reimburses the private sector firm for negative cash flows, which are typical in the early stage of a project, 
and retain a share of total revenue when the project is generating a positive cash flow. In practice, governments find it 
hard to compensate a private sector firm contemporaneously and prefer to allow the private company to carry forward 
losses with interest. This form of taxation can potentially capture a large share of the resource rent without distorting 
investment and production decisions. Furthermore, the tax base is likely to differ from the resource rent and will again 
introduce distortions to investment and production decisions, though they are less severe than royalty tax regimes. A 
final approach is through using fixed fees for exploration and auctions for exploration rights to capture some of the 
resource rent. When other forms of taxation are also levied later on the project life, the amount of rent captured will be 
reduced or the fee will discourage investment. The taxation of oil and gas resources in the United States varies depending on the ownership of the 
land with the deposit. As the majority is on private land, the federal government has little influence on the 
taxation of these resources other than through the normal application of corporate income taxes, which is 
determined by Congress. When oil and gas deposits are on federal land, taxation on mineral resources is 
implemented by the Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior (ONRR) collects revenues 
when bids for leases are made (bonus bids), rent while the lease is not in production (rental fees) and 
royalties when production starts (royalties). Following criticism from GAO over the low federal 
government take (GAO, 2013), the Department of Interior changed offshore terms (royalty rates set at 
18.75% for some offshore deposits, minimum bids, rental rates), but has not changed the onshore fiscal 
system (royalty rate of 12.5%). For deposit on federal land, the states also get a share of the revenues from 
the royalties. The split is 50-50 between the state and federal governments with the exception of resources 
lying on the outer continental shelf for which the revenue split for littoral state governments is 27% or 
37.5% under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. For oil and gas deposits on private or state owned land, there is no consistent tax treatment across the 
states. Taxes on production as a share of the oil and gas sector's value added ranges from just 7% in 
Arkansas to almost 60% in Alaska (Table 2). Royalty tax revenues accrue totally to the state if the land is 
privately held. Different royalty taxes are in place in 30 states, ranging from 10 cents on the barrel for oil 
in Ohio to 8% of gross value in Kansas. Alaska implements a hybrid system combining a royalty tax and a 
profits tax, which has more desirable properties. Pennsylvania, the third largest producer of shale gas in 
2011, does not levy a specific tax. However, Pennsylvania introduced an unconventional gas well fee in 
2012. If revenues exceed a threshold, surplus revenues will be distributed to localities. At the local level, ECO/WKP(2014)43 13 states may share some of the royalty tax revenue with local governments. In addition, hydraulic fracturing 
rents are taxed through property and/or income taxes. In some cases, property taxes include mineral rights 
in the base. Consistent with the theoretical analysis of royalty taxation, the development of reserves tends 
to be depressed by higher rates of royalty taxation on value added (see Annex). Table 2. Tax revenue from oil and gas Selected states with significant shale gas production Taxes on production as % of

2.5 Note: Royalty taxes are all royalty revenues, not just those accruing from oil and gas mining. Source: BEA, Census bureau Future generations One challenge is to ensure that current resource use also supports economic welfare of future 
generations. On aggregate for the United States, estimates of adjusted net savings, which take into account 
whether total wealth (including natural resources) is increasing, suggest that investment in education 
outweighs the depletion of natural resources (Box 2). Using revenues to support future living standards 
differs across the states. Some such as Alaska, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming have 
created severance endowment funds, which inter alia use revenues raised from oil and gas exploitation to 
help finance capital projects and invest in education. For example, West Virginia created a Future Fund, 
capturing 3% of the severance tax to fund infrastructure, education and economic development as well as 
tax relief and cultural preservation. The fund created limitations on how much lawmakers could draw on 
the fund (SWF Institute, 2014). The New Mexico Severance Tax Permanent Fund uses its resources to pay ECO/WKP(2014)43 14 interest in bonds financing capital projects also investing in education. Other states have earmarked natural 
resource revenues to support spending that is less likely to benefit future generations. For example, West 
Virginia did not establish a specific mechanism to ensure future generations also benefitted from the 
mining of its substantial coal deposits. Rather revenues were spent annually. As coal mining in the state 
has weakened, the state is facing challenges in adapting to this environment (Williams, 2008). Box 2. Natural resources and economic sustainability Non-renewable natural resources once (economically) recoverable will be ceteris paribus depleted. As such the 
country's stock of (natural) wealth is reduced, with the exploitation akin to a process of disinvestment. As such future 
generations are not guaranteed to share in the benefits of these natural resources. This has led some authors, such as 
Hartwick (1977), to recognise that investing the rents captured during the depletion of the exhaustible natural resource 
in (produced) capital can enhance sustainability. That is, not only the current generation enjoy the benefits from 
resource exploitation, but future generations also enjoy raised consumption possibilities. However, the degree to which 
natural and produced capital stocks are substitutable is not always clear cut and in some cases the amount of natural 
capital needs to be preserved above critical levels in order to provide environmental services that may provide life-
support functions. Identifying empirically whether the current patterns of natural resource exploitation is sustainable presents a 
number of difficulties in both the measurement of natural capital and identifying which types of investment will augment 
future generation's stock of wealth. Standard measures of economic development, such as GDP growth and measures 
of capital stocks generally do not consider the role of environment in production. A number of approaches have taken 
into account the environment. @BULLET One approach has been to adjust the standard measure of national savings by the depletion of natural resources and the impact on environment. The so-called genuine savings or adjusted net saving assess 
whether the exploitation of natural resources (and environmental externalities) does not subtract from 
economic welfare of future generations (World Bank, 2006). Updated estimates for 2008 suggest that for the 
United States that net savings (gross national savings minus consumption of fixed capital) was negative. 
However, adjusted net saving was positive when taking into account education spending and making 
adjustments for the depletion of energy and mineral resources and environmental damage from carbon 
dioxide emissions and particulate matter. Nonetheless, savings in the United States were comparatively 
small by both measures (Figure 2.6). ECO/WKP(2014)43 15 Figure 6. Adjusted national savings (2008) As a percentage of GNI Source: World Bank. @BULLET Related and recent work at the OECD has attempted to take account of the use of certain types of natural capital through adjustments to productivity measures (Brandt et al., 2013). This work (covering the period 
1986 to 2008) suggests for the United States that the difference between traditional and adjusted 
productivity measures is not large (Figure 7). However, during this period, oil and gas reserves fell and the 
contribution of natural capital to growth was slightly negative overall. As such, during the period of resource 
depletion, other factors of production needed to increase slightly to maintain similar rates of growth. Figure 7. Average annual productivity growth with and without natural capital Based on data from the OECD Productivity Database, 1986-2008 Note. The MFP growth with natural resources is derived by extending a standard production function with measures of natural 
resource flows and estimates of their associated unit costs. Source: Brandt et al. (2013). -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 SWE

At the federal level, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was introduced in 1964 to capture 
some of the rent from the depletion of oil and gas resources on the outer continental shelf to protect other 
natural resources, such as coastal areas, open areas and wildlife habitat. At the state level, a few states levy 
taxes to address oil field clean ups and restoration, including Louisiana and Texas. Several other states levy 
oil and gas conservation fees which are earmarked for capping and reclaiming abandoned wells amongst 
other uses. Local impacts Hydraulic fracturing has aroused considerable controversy. The environmental and social impact of 
large scale drilling activity across the landscape has provoked significant local opposition in some parts of 
the country. Bans have been imposed in New York State, metropolitan Pittsburgh and a handful of towns 
around the country. However, survey findings reveal respondents are not necessarily opposed to hydraulic 
fracturing, but want assurances that it will be conducted correctly (Krupnick, 2013), implying a role for 
regulatory frameworks in facilitating stakeholder acceptance (IEA, 2012). Local externalities At the local level, inhabitants experience a number of externalities (Muehlenbachs et al., 2012). Close 
to the well inhabitants face (adjacency) costs associated with noise and light pollution, local air pollution, 
visual dis-amenities (pollution). In addition, there are a number of vicinity effects as people are affected by 
the impact of traffic congestion and road damage as the road pavement in rural areas are often not 
constructed for the heavy vehicles. The major impacts for residents are arguably through the environmental 
externalities created by hydraulic fracturing. There is considerable uncertainty about these effects and the 
science far from settled. The impact on the local environment is not universally negative. The substitution 
of coal and other fuels by natural gas may have effects through reducing other emissions, such as sulphur 
dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and particulate matter. Hydraulic fracturing puts stress on water resources… Up to 5 million gallons of water are needed for each shale gas hydraulic fracturing well. This demand 
in a relatively short period of time puts stress on local water resources, which is not limited to a problem of 
arid regions. Demands on water resources have mounted and water stress has become a more common 
phenomenon. The rate of extraction of ground water from aquifers has increased over the 20 th century, 
partly driven by land drainage to extend farmland. Since the turn of the 21 st century, the rate of ground 
water depletion has accelerated, such that slightly less than one-fifth of total groundwater depletion since 
1900 occurred in the period 2000-08 (USGS, 2013). While hydraulic fracturing only accounts for a small 
fraction of the demand for water, the localised demand for a short period can create important stresses on 
water resources. For surface water, such demands can threaten the environmental services provided by the 
local ecosystems when water levels or flows drop precipitously. Respecting the competing demands on water resources requires adequate water rights are in place, 
while respecting minimum flow requirements for water bodies. Pricing water resources effectively and 
allowing trading may go some way to using limited water resources efficiently. Remediation efforts and 
biodiversity-offsets or compensatory mitigation, which ensure that the environmental damage in one area 
is compensated in another, can play a role to mitigate excessive stresses on water resources. For example, 
the EPA has established  " mitigation banking "  to preserve wetlands. Under this approach, projects that will 
have unavoidable impacts on wetlands must purchase offset credits to support the establishment, 
restoration or enhancement of wetlands in a different location, which may be undertaken by a third party. 
In a similar approach to offsets, the federal government uses royalties from the depletion of oil and gas ECO/WKP(2014)43 17 resources on the outer continental shelf held in the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to protect 
other natural resources. Similarly, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Coastal Impact Assistance 
Program (CIAP) which provides money for coastal restoration and preservation for littoral states. While 
the offset approach has attractive properties, care is needed to ensure that there are not non-linearities with 
the depreciation of natural capital in one location that cannot be offset by supporting natural capital in 
another (see Dasgupta, 2009 for a general consideration of these issues). In this context, the permitting 
authority needs to ensure that the proposed project does not have unavoidable (irreversible) consequences, 
such as contamination of a groundwater aquifer, that outweigh the proposed benefits. When irreversible 
effects are a concern, the regulatory authority should postpone decisions until new information helps 
reduce uncertainty about the consequences. Such decisions should also account for the public's preferences 
for environmental services, which vary across the country. In this context, taking stock of opinions, such as 
is done by Canada's biennial Household and the Environment Survey, would help better inform decisions 
concerning the environment at both the national and state level. … and risks water contamination Risks from hydraulic fracturing wells include contamination of shallow freshwater aquifer and surface 
water with chemicals and other substances used or released in the fracturing process. Reports examining 
the potential for contamination of drinking water suggest that risks to aquifers are low if the hydraulic 
fracturing takes place at sufficient depth. However, contamination risks stemming from faulty wells and 
accidental spillage leading to surface water contamination remain (Royal Society, 2012). Groundwater 
contamination risk remains a major concern expressed by residents. This can also be seen through the 
effect on property prices. Early evidence, using data from Pennsylvania and New York on house sales and 
well placement suggests that houses near the wells benefit from economic rents, but within a close radius 
of 1-1.5 km, the fear of groundwater contamination pushes house prices down (between 10% and 22%) 
compared to houses that rely on public water supplies (Muehlenbachs et al., 2012). Households may suffer 
from adjacency effects, which push prices down further next to the wells. Overall the study noted that the 
benefits from shale gas arrive quickly but then dissipate, consistent with a boom and bust type of 
development. Water is often co-produced with hydraulic fracturing, which creates challenges for treatment and 
disposal, such as separating out and re-injecting in lower appropriate disposal zones. Some of the water 
introduced in the well (15-80%) will become  " flowback " , which may need to be treated due to chemicals 
added to the fracturing fluids as well as the materials mobilised during the fracturing process, such as 
heavy metals and naturally-occurring radioactive materials. The wastewater may be recycled and used in 
other wells, re-injected deep underground (often into salinic acquifers), treated and added to surface water 
or spread over the land. Kiviat (2013) reports a number of incidents where hydro-fracturing fluids have 
been released into the environment and discusses the implications for biodiversity. Empirical work 
suggests that the major problems are more likely to be found at the treatment sites than the wells 
(Olmstead et al., 2013). Fracturing fluids contain chemicals to separate the oil and gas from the rock 
formations and ease their passage through the rock as well as propping agents which hold the rock 
formations open to allow the natural gas and oil to flow through the horizontal portion of the well to the 
vertical portion of the well. Some states have not required the disclosure of what chemicals are being used 
in fracturing fluids (McFeeley, 2012). However, other states have begun to require industry participants to 
report which chemicals are being used and voluntary reporting of chemicals is occurring with groups such 
as Fracfocus and the EPA is seeking public comments on disclosure. While exemptions to public 
disclosure due to trade secrets can be part of the disclosure regime, these should not become a loophole and 
companies should be required to report the chemicals being used to a regulatory authority. ECO/WKP(2014)43 18 The regulatory regime is complex Regulation on water use and the protection of groundwater and surface waters has originated at 
different levels of governments, which has resulted in a complex overall regulatory regime. For example, 
local authorities, groundwater management areas and regional planning bodies are involved in granting 
access to water resources, and state and federal bodies are responsible for environmental management and 
stewardship. Most regulation of hydraulic fracturing is issued at the state level, although the Department of 
Interior can regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal land and EPA has some limited responsibility, which is 
typically implemented by authorised states, tribes and territories. Under the federal Safe Drinking Water 
Act, EPA's regulations specify minimum permitting requirements applicable to hydraulic fracturing of oil 
and gas wells using diesel fuels. The EPA released guidance to state and EPA regional permit writers in 
2014. These regulations also apply to underground injection of wastewaters from oil and gas production 
(irrespective of use of diesel fuels) for purposes of disposal. In addition, under the federal Clean Water 
Act, EPA's regulations restrict the discharge of hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface waters under the 
national technology-based limitations programme. However, federal regulatory authority to address water 
quality impacts of hydraulic fracturing is limited under several key environmental statutes – for example, 
the oil and gas stormwater exemption from permitting requirements under the Clean Water Act and the 
exclusion of hydraulic fracturing (other than where diesel is used) from the Safe Drinking Water Act 
Underground Injection Control requirements. The federal authorities can also become involved when the 
EPA issues an endangerment order, which can require a company to take immediate action to protect 
individuals from harm (Rahm, 2011). Further study is needed to formulate regulation to address 
environmental concerns and increase public confidence in hydraulic fracturing, notably to harmonise and 
strengthen the impact assessments of drilling projects. What happens when things go wrong? Transportation needs for shale oil and gas have grown rapidly, often in regions where the existing 
pipeline capacity is insufficient. This has led to a surge in railroad transport, with the number of railroad 
carloads of crude oil jumping an estimated 42 times between 2008 and 2013 (Association of American 
Railroads, 2013). Rail in late 2013 accounted for the transport of around 800 000 barrels a day or 11% of 
total oil shipments. The transport of crude oil by train raises a number of risks. During 2013, a number of 
accidents, including the explosion in North Dakota, reignited concerns about the safety of this mode of 
transport, particularly in the aftermath of the Lac Mégantic tragedy in Canada. In this context, measures to 
help develop pipeline capacity, such as expediting the planning process and reducing uncertainty about 
projects, would be welcome. However, due to the dispersed nature of drilling, transporting oil to the 
pipelines will still require other means of transportation. Federal authorities are responsible for setting rail 
standards while state authorities, such as New York, are drawing up contingencies plans for the possibility 
of accidents. To some extent, railroad transport is also favoured by the Jones Act, which bans foreign 
shipping undertaking cabotage in US coastal waters. Railroads are ideally placed to benefit from the lack 
of domestic shipping capacity. A second area is what happens in the aftermath of significant environmental damage. After the 
Deepwater Horizon event, Congress passed the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist 
Opportunities, and Revived Economies (RESTORE) which channelled penalties levied under the Clean 
Water Act for coastal restoration. Applying similar approaches for hydraulic fracturing may run into 
problems. Due to the smaller size of firms involved, the possibility of appealing for bankruptcy can mean 
that penalties will not cover all damage costs if the firm is found liable and it will not internalising the 
externalities. Requiring insurance-type payments may lead to riskier behaviour than otherwise. In this 
context, levying restoration fees, as many states already do to deal with clean-up costs and abandoned 
wells, while leaving firms liable may be a reasonable approach. Alternatively, regulators could set 
verifiable precautionary standards backed up by legal proceedings (Hiriart et al. 2004). An alternative ECO/WKP(2014)43 19 approach could be implemented through bonding requirements, which are already used in a number of 
states and by the federal government. Under this approach, companies post bonds prior to drilling wells. If 
the exploitation results in no environmental damage the bond is returned to the company when production 
at the well ceases (Davis, 2014). States with a longer experience of oil and gas production tend to have 
stricter regulations in place and levy restoration fees or bonds (Richardson et al., 2013). Links to climate change In 2009, the United States committed to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the 
range of 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. There have been sizeable reductions in emissions, partly arising 
due to the recession as well as to improvements in energy efficiency in the economy (Figure 8). In 2012, 
carbon emissions from the energy sector fell to the lowest level in two decades. Among OECD countries, 
the United States has achieved among the biggest improvements in energy intensity in recent decades, 
albeit from relatively high levels. Its energy intensity declined at an average rate of 2% per year from 1980 
to 2010. In recent years, policy efforts to improve energy efficiency further have been reinforced. For 
example, the 2009 economic stimulus package included new energy efficiency initiatives and substantial 
additional funding for existing programs. In June 2013, the administration unveiled a comprehensive 
Climate Action Plan, including a plan to impose carbon emissions standards to both new and existing 
power plants. Despite the positive trends, preliminary data show that carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have 
risen by around 2% in 2013. During the summer of 2013, higher demand for electricity induced an increase 
in coal-fired electricity supply and severe winter weather raised energy demand at the end of the year, 
boosting carbon dioxide emissions and highlighting the interplay between weather conditions and the 
electricity sector (Box 3). The current approach to meet climate change objectives relies less on using market-based instruments, 
such as an emission tax, and more on regulation. In this context, the EPA is charged with regulating 
greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation under the Clean Air Act. The states will have 
flexibility in how to implement these requirements for power plants in their jurisdictions, thereby allowing 
them to choose locally-appropriate compliance measures. Other initiatives to improve energy efficiency 
will serve to reduce emissions further. This approach to emission abatement is arguably more costly than 
an emission tax, though by inducing fuel switching may achieve some reductions at relatively low cost 
(Goulder et al. 2014). However, with this approach, care is needed to prevent the marginal abatement costs 
diverging too much. Given the variety of approaches the states are likely to adopt, including market-based 
cap-and-trade schemes (see Box 4), regulation may be needed to limit differences in the stringency of 
regulation as well as address possible coordination failures across states. Carefully designed state-level 
policy has the potential to achieve considerable emission mitigation at relatively low cost 
(Burtraw et al. 2014). ECO/WKP(2014)43 20 Figure 8. Some progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions 1.

GBR Structure effect Efficiency effect Average annual % change ECO/WKP(2014)43 21 Box 3. Greater weather variability The scientific evidence assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) points to climate 
change amplifying extreme weather events, with the effects varying regionally. The types of extreme weather events 
that are becoming more frequent include longer heat waves and heavier precipitation. In North America the threat of 
flooding and more intense storms also appears to have risen. The combination of changing weather patterns with trends in energy demand has had implications for electricity 
generation. Energy demand has changed as the share of industry in total output has fallen, technology has become 
more energy efficient and the greater diffusion of air conditioning. These trends have led to electricity demand 
becoming more weather sensitive such that when weather conditions lead to more use of cooling or heating, demand 
for electricity surges. Over time as the reduction in consumption from sectoral change and improved energy efficiency 
has reduced the average demand for electricity, the increasing sensitivity of demand to heating or cooling has seen the 
ratio of peak to average demand for electricity gradually increase (Figure 9). During the periods of surges in demand, 
the marginal producer of electricity may change with corresponding changes in fuel type. In 2013, more days had 
pronounced peaks in temperature which would require cooling in buildings (raising cooling degree days) while the 
winter in early 2014 was exceptionally cold raising the amount of heating needed to maintain a comfortable 
temperature in buildings (raising heating degree days). Partly as a result, emissions of carbon dioxide from coal rose 
by an estimated 2%, reversing some of the gains in emission reductions recorded over the previous five years as 
previously mothballed coal-fired power stations were brought back on line. Greater weather variability complicates the 
management of the electricity market and potentially makes climate change mitigation more difficult to achieve in the 
absence of other measures. To the extent that the weather patterns are becoming more volatile, these challenges may 
become more difficult to address. Figure 9. Variation in electricity demand is growing Ratio of peak-to-average electricity demand in New England Source: Energy Information Administration. Shale gas can help reduce emissions Natural gas is a potential  " bridge fuel "  towards a lower carbon economy. The rapid development of 
US shale gas resources has helped to reduce emissions by leading to a substitution away from coal-
powered electricity generation to natural gas turbines (Figure 7). Indeed, coal-fired power stations have 
been under pressure from slowing electricity demand and competition from low natural gas prices. Coal-
fired electricity generation has fallen by around 11 percentage points of total electricity production 
between 2008 and 2012, while natural gas accounted for a rise of 9 percentage points between 2008 and 
2012, suggesting little  " rebound effect "  induced by cheaper natural gas prices. Furthermore, prospects for 
some coal-fired power stations are weakened further by Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) which 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 ECO/WKP(2014)43 22 will take effect in April 2015. The EIA (2012) projects that this will lead to significant retirement of coal-
fired power capacity. These trends are likely to reduce externalities significantly. Detailed county-level 
modelling for the United States suggests that by taking into account estimates of the environmental and 
health impact of coal-fired power generation the harmful impact of air pollution from the sector is double 
the conventional measure of value added. By contrast, the ratio of harmful impacts of air pollution from 
natural gas-fired generation to the sector's value added is only one third (Muller et al., 2011). Natural gas can play a role in helping renewable energy gain a greater share of electricity generation 
by helping to address the intermittency problem. Renewables are often a  " must-take "  generation source, 
which means that when electricity generation from renewable sources fluctuates the system operator must 
somehow achieve balance elsewhere (Weiss et al., 2013). From a security-of-supply perspective 
renewables can thus create challenges to system operators. As natural gas fired generators can adapt 
relatively quickly to changes in demand and supply they have a role to play in facilitating the expansion of 
renewables. This might happen because electricity production from natural gas would help meet demand 
when generation from wind and solar electricity drops or rises due to changes in wind and sunlight. In this 
context, an energy mix focusing on the combination of natural gas and renewables in electricity generation 
will go a long way towards providing reliable supply while lowering US greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, gas-powered generators cannot react quickly enough to offset sudden large surges or drop offs in 
renewable supply. In this context, developing storage capacity, smart grid technologies and price sensitive 
demand would complement renewable and natural gas generated electricity (Benatia et al., 2013). Finally, relatively low natural gas prices will also affect emissions from the transport sector, making 
natural gas powered vehicles more attractive. Already low natural gas prices and the expectation that they 
will remain low has induced investment in natural gas powered vehicles. The implementation in 2014 of 
EPA regulations extending fuel economy standards to medium and heavy-duty vehicles will likely give a 
further fillip to natural gas powered vehicles. As the refuelling network is expanded this could induce an 
expansion from short-haul to long-haul trucking, leading to further gains in emission reductions (EIA, 
2013). The EIA projects that the transportation sector's consumption of natural gas will almost double by 
2040, with a large part of demand driven by gas-powered heavy duty vehicles. The shale gas challenge for climate change Fugitive methane emissions and gas flaring While the substitution of natural gas for coal leads to lower emissions in electricity generation, the 
production of non-conventional natural gas leads to emissions of fugitive methane during production, due 
to leaks from loose fitting pipes and venting from gas wells, and transportation. More work remains to be 
done to quantify the scale of these emissions and at what points in production and transportation they 
occur. More is known about production than distribution (Allen et al., 2013; EPA, 2013; IEA, 2012). 
Accounting for these emissions could significantly reduce the climate benefits from switching to natural 
gas, though they are unlikely to offset the long-term benefits from substituting away from coal. 
Furthermore, relatively few sources may be high emitters and tools to identify rapidly and fix these leaks 
could have large benefits (Brandt et al., 2014). The EPA has in place a long-standing and voluntary Natural GasSTAR Programme that encourages 
the use of cost-efficient technologies to reduce and capture methane emissions. The administration has 
announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, building on the STAR 
programme. EPA guidance was to flare these emissions, as this reduces the potency of the emissions, but 
following amendments to air regulations for the oil and gas industry in 2012 (new source performance 
standards) companies are encouraged to move towards  " green completion "  of wells, which separates gas 
and liquids flowing from the well and captures the gas. The second phase of the amendments starting in ECO/WKP(2014)43 23 2015 requires companies to capture the gas and make it available for use or sale. In some cases, states and 
local governments have already moved to address this issue for example, Colorado, in collaboration with 
industry, has established regulations on minimising methane emissions. In other cases, states have 
considered using taxation on flaring or venting, which would help gas producers internalise global 
externalities. The differences across states regarding regulations on flaring or venting methane can be 
considerable, partly reflecting the relative development of pipeline infrastructure. For example, flaring 
methane in Texas is permitted in some case for 180 days, whereas in North Dakota flaring is allowed for 
one year before becoming liable to pay taxes and royalties on the flared gas. In addition, exemptions may 
then be granted if there are difficulties in connecting to a pipeline. At times, almost one-third of all gas 
produced in North Dakota has been flared or otherwise not marketed (EIA, 2011). Knock on effects on energy markets The substitution of natural gas for coal has seen repercussions on the market for coal. Despite 
declining domestic demand, US coal production has fallen relatively little as coal exports have more than 
doubled since the shale gas boom began to take hold in 2007 (Figure 10). Low carbon permit prices on the 
European market are inducing energy producers to increase their combustion of coal leading to a global 
rise in carbon emissions. Appropriately pricing the carbon content of fuels, such as with an emission tax, 
both in the United States and other countries, would ensure that the environmental benefits of switching to 
natural gas in one country are not lost through increasing coal consumption in other countries 
(see Golosov et al, 2014). Further rapid increases in coal exports may be limited by capacity constraints at 
existing export terminals coupled with local opposition -concerned about particulate matter pollution -to 
increasing railroad transportation and constructing new coal yards at ports. Figure 10. Coal production has fallen while exports have risen Million short tonnes Source: Energy Information Administration. Risks of lock-in A final challenge for climate change policy arises from the risk of lock in, whereby choices made 
today will limit the opportunities available in the future. The development of shale gas can support the 
transition towards a lower carbon economy. As seen above, relatively low natural gas prices have already 
encouraged fuel substitution towards less carbon-intensive energy production and provide a platform on 
which to build. The question is will natural gas act as a  " bridge fuel "  to moving towards a zero net 
emissions target or lead to inertia to additional mitigation, which may also arise due to stranded assets. In 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 1200 2001

in the longer-term as natural gas begins to be depleted the energy market will respond by switching back to 
coal-fired power. In this context, while the shale gas boom could provide the  " bridge fuel "  towards a lower 
carbon economy, flanking measures (emission pricing, subsidising innovation, supporting renewables and 
developing smart electricity grids) will be required to ensure this outcome. In particular, two areas were 
flanking measures may be required are in countering natural gas hindering renewables and low prices 
stymieing innovation. The expansion of natural gas fired generation may hinder the future development of renewable 
energy. The development of smart grids -which offers the potential to harness renewable energy 
effectively -is incremental and path dependent (Koenigs et al. 2013). Without careful preparation, the 
current expansion of natural gas and development of the supporting electricity infrastructure could hinder 
future movement towards a lower carbon economy by creating difficulties in integrating a larger share of 
more volatile renewable sources of energy. Against this background, the different government and private 
actors need to co-ordinate their activities and support long-term investments that will re-orientate 
transmission and distribution towards networks which can accommodate a larger share of low or (net) no 
carbon electricity generation. The US Energy Independence and Security Act (2007) and the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) have provided government support and funding for nationwide 
modernisation of the electrical grid and ensure stable mid-term prospects for private investors. The Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission also works to promote the modernisation of the grid and the integration of 
renewables in electricity generation. Such actions are important in overcoming possible lock in effects. Box 4. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative In 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), bringing together initially 10 states, introduced a cap-
and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions. 
1 The initiative covers all large fossil-fuel electricity plants in the states 
with the cap based on long-term modelling predating the dramatic changes in energy prices, resulting in an initial 
allocation of too many allowances. The substitution towards natural gas has been particularly pronounced in the states 
covered by RGGI, with coal and oil-fired electricity generation falling from accounting for 35% of electricity production 
in 2005 to 13% in 2012. Furthermore, clement weather conditions reducing energy demand also helped bring down 
emissions dramatically below the agreed cap. In response, 9 of the original 10 states agreed to a 45% reduction in the 
cap from 2014.In addition, the cap is now designed to tighten further gradually. This feature should mean the emission 
cap becomes more challenging over time and that the price of emission allowances begins to rise. The states use 
revenues from the auction of allowances to support renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. To some extent the approach to climate change adopted by the administration, which has the effect of making 
coal-fired electricity generation less competitive, benefits schemes like RGGI by levelling the playing field and reducing 
possible concerns about  " leakage " . Nonetheless, combining command and control approaches with market 
mechanisms risks increasing the overall costs of climate change mitigation. 1. California subsequently introduced a cap-and-trade program in 2012. At the state level, Renewable Portfolio Standards, in place in 30 states, will ensure that renewable 
sources account for a set share of generation. Under these programmes, electricity providers are mandated 
to purchase a specified share of electricity from renewable generation sources, usually with the share rising 
over time. While these policies have had a strong effect on the growth of this sector, and they may counter 
the danger of lock in, they nonetheless come at a higher cost than market-based mechanisms. However, 
removing restrictions in state Renewable Portfolio Standards on the location of renewable generation and 
mitigating federal and state incentives to generate power when prices are negative would increase the 
social benefit of these programs. (Schmalensee, 2013). Well-targeted and time-limited policies to support 
renewable energy can speed the deployment of renewable energy generation capacity. ECO/WKP(2014)43 25 A final area where low natural gas prices may present a challenge to greenhouse gas mitigation is 
through the effect on innovation. The United States is a leader in innovation on energy efficiency 
technologies, although only a fraction of government R&D support is allocated to the environment 
and energy (about 1.8% of government R&D). Patent filings related to green growth have been 
steadily rising since 1990 and began outpacing the growth of total US patents since 2005.The impressive 
gains in energy efficiency witnessed over the past decades were partly driven by high prices driving 
innovation in energy-saving technology (Popp, 2002; Aghion et al. 2012). In order to mitigate these 
undesirable outcomes, some subsidisation of innovation in energy saving technology to  " direct "  technical 
change would be warranted. Such an approach would be in line with the policy mix advocated by 
Acemoglu et al. (2012), who showed that optimal environmental policy would use carbon taxes in 
combination with subsidies to direct innovation activity towards the  " clean "  sector when goods are 
substitutable. Case study evidence supports an approach of combining taxation and subsidisation in 
promoting innovation to improve environmental outcomes (OECD, 2010). At the federal level, the 
America COMPETES Act created the Advanced Research Projects Agency -Energy, which funds energy 
technology projects. More recently, the administration has proposed to create an Energy Security Trust 
Fund, which would work in this direction. Certain states, notably California -and also participants in 
RGGI -have also invested in promoting energy efficiency and clean generation technologies.

The successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies is contributing to an energy 
renaissance in the United States. Natural gas supply in particular has surged and estimates of potentially 
recoverable natural gas resources have been revised upwards considerably. Developments for crude oil 
have been similar if less spectacular. Against this background, how policy can affect the development of 
natural gas and crude oil deposits acquires some importance. The form of taxation most typically used in 
the United States is the severance tax, more commonly known as a royalty tax. This form of taxation has 
adverse effects on the incentives to developed new reserves and also to abandon wells earlier than they 
would be using other forms of taxation, such as profit taxes, which are neutral to development and 
production. 2. 
The analysis in this annex examines the impact of taxation on the addition to natural gas and 
crude oil reserves using US state-level data. This annex contains, first, a description of recent 
developments in natural gas and crude oil reserves. It then briefly examines determinants of oil and gas 
reserve growth. The third section describes the available data and the empirical approach to assessing these 
influences. This is followed by a presentation and brief discussion of the results. Recent reserve developments 3. 
Estimates of proved reserves of oil and gas have altered dramatically recently, following the 
successful deployment of new technologies for advanced drilling. The Energy Information Agency 
markedly increased its estimates of recoverable gas resources (Figure 1). The addition of new proved 
reserves has maintained the ratio of reserves to production for crude oil, which has been relatively stable 
over a prolonged period. The recent surge in natural gas proved reserves has reversed a prolonged decline 
in the reserves to production ration over the second half of the 20 th century (Figure 2).The distribution of 
shale gas deposits across the country is quite widespread, though the proved reserves are predominantly 
located in a handful of states, which is also where the large shale gas plays (i.e. where production is 
occurring) are located. These developments have seen the proved natural gas reserves increase 
significantly in a number of states (Figure 3). Recent increases in crude oil reserves have been relatively 
less substantial overall, but within a handful of states (notably Texas, North Dakota) the increases in 
proved reserves of oil is dramatic. ECO/WKP(2014)43 31 Figure A.1. Oil and natural gas proved reserves 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 30

Examining reserve development rather than supply can avoid some of the complications 
presented by the effects of changes to the rate of extraction and the influence of storage on short-run 
supply (Ponce and Neumann, 2014). The approach adopted here looks at factors influencing the 
development of proved reserves (IEA, 2013). Energy prices will play a role in determining proved reserves 
by affecting the share of already discovered technically feasible reserves that are recoverable given 
extraction and other costs. Prices will also affect the date at which a well is abandoned: other things being 
equal, rising prices are likely to keep a well in production longer. 5. 
Empirical findings suggest that natural gas supply is inelastic in the very short run, but is more 
elastic in the longer run (Ponce and Neumann, 2014). While supply may be relatively inelastic, investment 
in exploration and development appears to react to price changes, as shown by the rapid increase in the 
number of crude oil rotary rigs when relative prices changed for oil and gas (Figure 4). In 2007/8 as the 
shale gas boom began to lead to a surge in supply, natural gas prices collapsed while crude oil prices 
continued recovering after the financial crisis, pushing up the relative price of crude oil substantially. Other 
factors may also lead to a structural break in the oil and gas mining sector around this time. The successful 
introduction of hydraulic fracturing may have affected the success of finding reserves. Forbes and Zampelli 
(2002) argue that deposits in tight sands and shale are easier to locate than conventional reserves and that 
hydrocarbons at shallower depths are more easily discovered. 6. 
Besides the physical availability of drilling rigs, the tax regime in place is likely to influence 
incentives for exploration and development of reserves. Andrade de Sá and Daubanes (2014) point out that 
royalty taxes are likely to blunt incentives to develop reserves and also give incentives to abandon wells 
before would be the case with other taxes, such as profit taxes. Royalty (severance) taxes are the 
predominant tax instrument used in the United States for capturing some of the resource rent. Only Alaska 
implements a profits tax (alongside a royalty tax). On the other hand, Pennsylvania does not attempt to tax 
the resource rent from hydraulic fracturing. Taxes on production reported by the BEA for the oil and gas 
mining sector includes severance taxes and also the normal corporate income taxes, which the federal 
authorities levy on all companies. The overall tax take relative to sectoral value added can vary enormously 
across the states, but also across time within states (Figure 5). To some extent these differences will reflect 
the differences in the severance taxes, though variations in tax schedules, such as lower rates offered for 
the use of enhanced recovery techniques, will also play a role. The Census Bureau reports state severance 
tax revenues. However, these revenues are not restricted to oil and gas mining. ECO/WKP(2014)43 34 Figure A.4. Exploration activity and price developments Source: Baker Hughes, Datastream 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 Jan-1991

The empirical approach adopted is an autoregressive distributed lag (ADRL) model (Pesaran 
et al., 2001). This approach allows the estimation of a relationship in levels as well as complex short-run 
dynamics and the mixing of series that are stationary and non-stationary. The general form of this model is: 񮽙 񮽙 = = + 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 + + 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 + + 񮽙 where Y is the dependent variable and X is a set of explanatory variables. The actual specification used in 
the following analysis exploits the state-level information using a panel data approach, taking the form of 
an unrestricted error correction model with the following specification: ∆∆ , = = + 񮽙 񮽙 , 񮽙 + + 񮽙 񮽙 , 񮽙 + + 񮽙 ∆∆ , + 񮽙 ∆∆ , + + 񮽙 + 񮽙 񮽙񮽙񮽙 񮽙 񮽙񮽙񮽙 񮽙 񮽙񮽙 where Y is the measure of reserves (dry and wet natural gas reserves and crude oil proved reserves) and X 
includes the relevant natural gas or crude oil price, the number of drilling rigs operating in the state and the 
tax revenues in the oil and gas mining sector. The model is estimated with state-level fixed effects to take 
into account unobserved heterogeneity at the state level. As energy prices are not available at the state-
level, period fixed effects are not used. The lag length is set to one, partly due to the limited number of 
time periods available, but this choice is also supported by the Schwarz criterion for lag length selection. 8. 
The addition to reserves is assumed to be driven by energy prices, the exploration and 
development activities and the prevailing tax regime. The data for reserves is taken from the Energy 
Information Agency (EIA) using proved dry natural gas reserves (wet reserves are also used for robustness 
checks) and crude oil for states. Drilling activity at the state level is from Backer Hughes, but this has the 
shortcoming that state level information does not indicate whether the drilling rig is being used for oil or 
natural gas exploration. Information on taxes on production and value added in the sector are from the 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 SD TN AR LA MN NJ CA IN MS PA TX ND OK AL NE FL VA CO NY IL WY NV WV MT MI NM UT OH ID KY KS AK 2000 2011 ECO/WKP(2014)43 36 Bureau of Economic Analysis, while information on severance taxes is from the Census Bureau. Price data 
were taken from Datastream, including the natural gas wellhead price and Henry Hub indices for gas prices 
and the West Texas Intermediate index for oil prices. Data availability and general characteristics of the 
data are given in Table 1. The time series properties of the data in logs are given in Table 2, revealing that 
none of the series used in the analysis are I(2), which is a requirement for using the ARDL approach. Table A.1. Data characteristics Source: EIA, BEA, Census Bureau, Datastream. Table A.2.

The estimations examine the relationship between reserves and prices, drilling rigs and various 
measures of taxation in reduced form equations. The first set of estimations is for the period up until the 
shale gas boom was beginning to have a marked effect on supply (1998-2009). The results reported in 
Table 3 show that the estimates for the long-run relationship in the first column have the expected signs 
and are statistically significant. The implied long-run elasticity of around 0.5 for natural gas prices is 
similar to findings for the price elasticity of natural gas supply using monthly data (Ponce and Neumann, Mean

First differences ECO/WKP(2014)43 37 2014). Investment in the number of drilling rigs is unsurprisingly associated with reserve growth. Higher 
tax revenues from the oil and gas mining sector slow the development of natural gas reserves. The 
estimates using slightly different measures of reserves and prices are very similar (Column 2 uses wet 
natural gas reserves, while Column 3 reports results when using the Henry Hub natural gas price rather 
than the wellhead price). When the sample is extended to 2011, the statistical significance diminishes, 
though the estimates are quantitatively similar in size. In part, this result is driven by the inclusion of 
Pennsylvania, where exceptionally rapid reserve growth in 2010 and 2011 suggest that a structural break 
occurs when the hydraulic fracturing boom takes hold. Finally, the results reported for crude oil reserves 
are weak, with most variables being statistically insignificant. Dropping the tax variable, so as to estimate 
the equation for a longer time period reveals the expected long-run relationship between reserve and prices 
as well as investment in drilling rigs. The implied long-run elasticity of supply of almost 0.4 is close to 
other estimates (Brook et al, 2004). Table A.3. Estimation results Note: Robust standard errors are reported, * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01 1.
