promote a better match between policies and citizens' preferences. At the same time, however, there are 
concerns about whether all regions will gain from more autonomy. Decentralisation may not lift all boats, 
with  " poor "  regions losing competitiveness with respect to better endowed ones, thus increasing regional 
disparities. The present work investigates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional 
inequality within countries. Particular attention is paid to the different channels through which 
decentralisation can affect disparities: taxing powers, spending autonomy and the vertical fiscal imbalance. 
The empirical analysis, which is conducted on a sample of 30 OECD countries for the period 1995-2011, 
suggests that a balanced fiscal structure, where local spending is mainly financed by local taxation, reduces 
regional disparities, by providing an incentive to better use local resources and implement policies that 
favour economic development. Keywords: Fiscal decentralisation, regional inequality, panel data JEL Classification: H71; H77; R11 ***** RESUME Décentralisation budgétaire et disparités régionales Si la décentralisation budgétaire peut permettre d'améliorer l'efficience de la fourniture des biens et 
services publics locaux et promouvoir une meilleure adéquation entre les politiques publiques et les 
préférences des citoyens, la question de savoir si toutes les régions peuvent tirer parti d'une plus grande 
autonomie est source de préoccupation. Il est possible que la décentralisation ne profite pas à toutes les 
régions, et qu'elle se traduise, pour les régions « pauvres » par une perte de compétitivité par rapport à 
d'autres mieux dotées, exacerbant ainsi les disparités régionales. Les travaux en cours consistent en une 
analyse du lien entre la décentralisation budgétaire et les inégalités régionales au sein des pays. Une 
attention particulière y est accordée aux différents vecteurs par lesquels la décentralisation peut influer sur 
les disparités : compétences en matière fiscale, autonomie au niveau des dépenses et déséquilibre 
budgétaire vertical. Cette analyse empirique menée à partir d'un échantillon de 30 pays de l'OCDE sur la 
période 1995-2011, tend à démontrer qu'une structure budgétaire équilibrée, dans laquelle les dépenses 
locales sont financées essentiellement par la fiscalité locale, a pour effet de réduire les disparités 
régionales, car elle incite à une meilleure utilisation des ressources locales et à la mise en oeuvre de 
politiques qui favorisent le développement économique.

Introduction and main findings 1. 
Differences in GDP per capita across OECD countries have decreased over the past twenty years. 
This process of economic convergence, however, masks increasing disparities within most countries. The 
average level of inter-regional disparities in per capita GDP is currently above the level of cross-country 
disparities. At the same time, many countries underwent far-reaching reforms to their intergovernmental 
fiscal frameworks, such as the devolution of new responsibilities in education, health care or economic 
affairs, and the assignment of additional taxing powers. Views differ sharply about whether fiscal 
federalism reforms will further deepen regional disparities or, on the contrary might help regions converge. 
While some point out that decentralisation provides jurisdictions with the incentives and the capacity for 
growth-oriented policy, thereby fostering convergence, others point out that devolution could exacerbate 
differences in regional competitiveness. 2. 
An important element of this debate is the source of revenue used by sub-national governments to 
finance local spending. There are two main sources: own resources and transfers from other levels of 
government. Own resources (such as local taxation and fees for services) provide the local government 
with a strong incentive to enlarge the tax base, becoming more competitive and more efficient in the use of 
resources, which enhances regional growth but not necessarily convergence. Transfers tend to equalise the 
fiscal capacity of regions, thus allowing common standards of public goods across the country, but provide 
little incentive for lagging regions to catch up with the frontier – especially if the gains in terms of 
increased tax base are captured by the central government. 3. 
This paper sheds light on the role played by intergovernmental fiscal frameworks in shaping 
regional economic development. The main findings are: 1.

Network for comments on earlier drafts. Special thanks go to Celia Rutkoski for assistance in preparing

papers include an OECD Economic Policy Paper (Blöchliger, Bartolini and Stossberg, 2016) that 
summarises the whole project, a working paper on fiscal decentralisation and income inequality (Stossberg, 
Bartolini and Blöchliger, 2016) and a working paper on the evolution of regional disparities (Arnold and 
Blöchliger, 2016). ECO/WKP(2016)54 7  Tax and revenue decentralisation, measured by the share of sub-central government (SCG) tax 
(or revenue) on total tax (or revenue), tend to reduce regional disparities; for instance, a 10 
percentage point increase in revenue decentralisation reduces regional disparities by 11% (or 4 
basis points of the coefficient of variation). The reduction of regional disparities seems to be 
driven by the responsibility to raise tax revenue as shown by the significant impact of two 
indicators of tax autonomy: the Regional Authority Index (RAI) and the OECD tax autonomy 
index.  By contrast, the vertical fiscal imbalance – an indicator of the share of spending not financed 
through own resources – is associated with larger regional disparities. The estimation results of 
the impact of the vertical fiscal imbalance support the hypothesis that the reduction of regional 
disparities passes through the incentive to raise own resources to finance sub-central spending.  The disparity-reducing effect is particularly strong at the extremes of the distribution, i.e. for the 
richest and poorest jurisdictions. The ratio between the top 10 th percentile and the bottom 10 th 
percentile of the distribution of regional per capita GDP is most affected by fiscal 
decentralisation.  The impact of revenue decentralisation on the incentive to activate regional sources of growth is 
confirmed by the results of a growth regression conducted on the top and bottom 25 th percentile 
of the distribution of regional per capita GDP within countries. The positive impact of tax 
decentralisation on GDP per capita growth is stronger in lagging regions, where there is more 
scope for activating or using local resources more efficiently, than in leading regions. 4. 
These results suggest that decentralisation should be implemented in a balanced way, with sub-
central spending largely covered by own (tax) revenue. Transfers from the central government, are 
beneficial to the extent that they do not counteract the incentive to raise tax revenues. Indeed, while central 
government transfers may be necessary – in the short run – to achieve national common standards of sub-
central public goods and services, the analysis shows that a trade-off exists with the incentives necessary to 
foster regional conversion. 5. 
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework and 
the existing empirical evidence on the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities, 
and also includes a discussion of the main channels through which fiscal decentralisation affects regional 
disparities; next, Section 3, provides a discussion of the methodology used to measure regional inequality 
and fiscal decentralisation, and a description of the empirical strategy; Section 4, describes the estimation 
results, and provides a discussion of their robustness; finally, Section 5, extends the analysis by 
considering the impact of fiscal decentralisation on percentile ratios and on the growth rate of high and low 
income regions. 2. Fiscal decentralisation and regional inequality 2.1. Theoretical framework 6. 
Intergovernmental fiscal frameworks – the allocation of responsibilities and resources across 
government levels – are part of the institutional set-up affecting regional convergence or divergence. The 
predominant view is that fiscal decentralisation, while increasing the efficiency of sub-central public 
finances, may induce greater regional disparities (Besley and Ghatak, 2003). A larger role of sub-central 
governments induces a better match of policies with citizens' preferences (Oates, 1972), thus increasing 
efficiency, but it also reduces the scope for central government intra-regional transfers, which aim at ECO/WKP(2016)54 8 reducing regional income differences (Prud'homme, 1995). As such, there are arguments both in favour of 
an  " equalising "  role of fiscal decentralisation and of a  " diverging "  role.  Proponents of fiscal decentralisation argue that the potential for growth is larger in  " poor "  or 
lagging regions than in rich regions. Fiscal decentralisation operates through the incentive to 
better use local resources for growth, for which there should be more scope in lagging regions 
than in regions that are already at the efficiency frontier (Rodriguez-Posé and Ezcurra, 2010). 
Through this channel fiscal decentralisation can ignite a virtuous process of regional 
convergence. Moreover, fiscal decentralisation can help jurisdictions beat the forces of 
agglomeration: fiscal autonomy represents an essential instrument for peripheral jurisdictions to 
compete with the gravitational pull of agglomerations (Baldwin and Krugman, 2004)  Sceptics of fiscal decentralisation argue that only well-endowed regions would benefit from fiscal 
decentralisation, thus increasing regional disparities. In particular, the playing field is considered 
uneven with important differences in institutional capacity (financial capacity and competence of 
the local administration) and in socioeconomic endowments (productivity, infrastructure, etc.) 
(Rodriguez-Posé and Gill, 2005). Furthermore, competition for mobile factors of production is 
likely to lead to a  " race to the bottom "  with inefficiently low tax rates, thus accentuating the 
problems of less well-endowed regions (Wilson, 2015). Finally, even if tax competition leads to 
an efficient allocation of resources, as in the voting-with-your-feet model of Tiebout (1956), 
regional disparities may increase. 2.2. Evidence from empirical studies 7. 
The empirical literature has only recently started to investigate the links between fiscal 
decentralisation and regional disparities. One of the first contributions is Shankar and Shah (2003) who 
propose a comprehensive discussion of the methodology and investigate the relationship between regional 
disparities and federal countries, suggesting that federal countries cope better with regional inequality than 
unitary countries because policies are less interventionist and focus on promoting factor mobility and 
minimum standards across the federation. A more direct investigation of the link is conducted by 
Rodriguez-Posé and Gill (2004). They compare national trends in fiscal decentralisation and regional 
disparities for the period 1980-2000, finding that decentralisation increases disparities because it fosters 
agglomeration effects. These studies, however, were all conducted with cross-section methodologies, thus 
the time dimension was not considered. 8. 
Lessmann (2006) considers both a cross-section and a panel of 17 OECD countries over the 
period 1980-2001. The author considers an econometric model where the coefficient of variation of 
regional per capita GDP is regressed on several indicators of fiscal decentralisation (separately 
considered), and a set of national characteristics that are supposed to affect regional inequality. The results 
of both the OLS estimation and the fixed effect estimation show that all indicators of fiscal decentralisation 
significantly reduce regional disparities. These results are confirmed by Lessman (2009), who conducts a 
similar analysis in a sample of 23 OECD countries for the period 1982-2000, and by Ezcurra and Pascual 
(2008) who restrict the analysis to a panel of 12 EU countries and to expenditure decentralisation. 9. 
The abovementioned results may depend on the type of countries considered, i.e. developed 
countries. Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra (2010) conjecture that the impact of fiscal decentralisation depends 
on the level of economic development. Using a panel of 26 countries (19 high income and 7 low income), 
they find that political and expenditure decentralisation reduces regional disparities only in high income 
countries, while considerably increasing them in low income countries. Lessman (2012) confirms the 
importance of the level of economic development using a panel of 54 countries over the period 1980-2009. ECO/WKP(2016)54 9 The author finds that the interaction between fiscal decentralisation and level of national GDP per capita 
has a negative impact on regional disparities, suggesting an important conditioning role of GDP per capita. 10. 
Finally, Kyriacou et al. (2013) tests the hypothesis that the quality of government rather than the 
level of development mediates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities. The 
authors use an unbalanced panel of 24 OECD countries over the period 1984-2006, showing that 
decentralisation reduces disparities in high government quality settings, but increases disparities in low 
government quality settings. Thus, they conclude that the different response of high and low income 
countries is driven by differences in the quality of the government. 11. 
Although the empirical evidence seems to support the idea that fiscal decentralisation reduces 
regional inequality, there is not much investigation into the channels that drive this result. The present 
work addresses this issue by explicitly considering the channels through which spending is financed 
(vertical fiscal imbalance) in a panel that covers also the time after the financial crisis. 2.3. Channels from decentralisation to disparities 12. 
The present work argues that the crucial channel through which decentralisation affects regional 
development and convergence is the incentive to increase own (tax) revenue. A balanced fiscal structure 
implies that most of local spending is financed by own revenues, thus providing a strong incentive to create 
and expand such revenue sources. Blöchliger and Pinero-Campos (2011) argue that equalisation transfers 
reduce fiscal disparities in the short term, but may reduce development incentives in the long run. The 
importance of a balanced fiscal structure is investigated also by Goerl and Seiferling (2014). They show 
that decentralisation may reduce household income inequality but it needs to satisfy additional conditions, 
among which a balanced distribution of expenditure and taxation at the local level. 13. 
The source of financing of local spending makes a difference in terms of the incentive to raise the 
tax base. While transfers are unrelated (or negatively related) to economic performance, own resources 
depend on the regional economy. Thus local policy makers have a strong incentive to use available 
resources and to put in place business-friendly policies. In the case of large transfers there is no need to 
expand the tax base in order to provide services to citizens; in fact, any increase in the regional tax base is 
 " appropriated "  by the central government. 14. 
There are mainly two channels through which local governments can expand their tax base:  Competition: competing for resources – people, firms or financial resources – with other regions;  A better use of existing resources: activating an endogenous process of development, which 
exploits sources of development, through the implementation of business-friendly regional 
policies and the more efficient use of untapped sources of development – e.g. human capital, 
local labour force, local amenities, etc. 15. 
Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of these two channels. The first channel may lead to 
either increasing or decreasing inequality, while the second channel would likely lead to regional 
convergence. The importance of the second channel lies in the idea that lagging regions may have 
 " inactive "  resources, so that policy can have a higher marginal impact in those regions than in the better-
performing ones, thus leading to a reduction in regional disparities (Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra, 2010). ECO/WKP(2016)54 10 Figure 1. From fiscal autonomy to regional inequality Note: The links between boxes represent unidirectional causal relationships, going from left to right. 16. 
There is some evidence that spending decisions of SCGs may depend on the size of the vertical 
fiscal imbalance. Data show a positive correlation between sub-central tax revenue and the share of SCG 
spending on economic activities (see Figure A.1, in the appendix). Recent studies have shown that tax 
decentralisation enhances local growth-enhancing investments (Fredriksen, 2013; Kappeler et al., 2013), 
thus shifting local spending towards more investment in infrastructure and education. Improving the 
transparency and efficiency of the regulatory framework is also important to attract investments from 
outside the region and mobilise local resources. 3. Empirical set-up 17. 
This section provides a discussion of the measurement issues encountered when considering 
regional inequality and fiscal decentralisation. Next, some stylised facts about the level and trend of 
regional inequality are provided. Finally, the econometric model is laid out. 3.1. Measurement issues: Indicators for regional inequality and fiscal decentralisation 3.1.1 Measuring regional inequality 18. 
The analysis focuses on regions defined according to the OECD Territorial Level 2 (TL2) 
typology (Box 1). The TL2 regional level represents a partition of the national territory, which is small 
enough to investigate internal geographical differences, and, at the same time, sufficiently large to avoid 
strong effects of cross-border commuting. OECD countries display large variations in terms of the number 
of TL2 regions and their size, ranging from 2 regions in Ireland to 51 in the United States, and from an 
average population of 0.7 million inhabitants in Norway to 12.8 million in Japan (Table 1). ECO/WKP(2016)54 11 19. 
Regional disparities – or regional inequality – are measured in terms of regional GDP per capita, 
defined in terms of constant USD. Taking the value of GDP in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) 
allows an international comparison of the level of GDP between regions belonging to different countries. 2 20. 
Regional GDP can be defined according to either the production or the income approach; it is not 
possible to use the expenditure approach because of the absence of data on imports and exports between 
regions. In practice, most countries use the production approach, but for non-market activities, such as 
general government and the health industry, the income approach is used. Regional GDP includes the 
 " gross product "  of the public administration as a whole, which consists of both sub-central and national 
government bodies for the share allocated to the region (European Union, 2013). 21. 
This definition implies that production or income is allocated to the region where the production 
unit is located. As a consequence, commuting for work-related reasons may affect regional GDP per 
capita, as people producing the GDP in one region may reside in another region, thus inflating the figures 
of GDP per capita. The geographical unit of analysis (TL2 regions), however, is large enough to contain 
most workers commuting within its borders. 2. 
Ideally a price index for each region should be constructed, as there are regional differences in purchasing 
power within the same country – 1 euro in Paris does not buy the same as 1 euro in Bordeaux. 
Unfortunately, for most countries there are no regional price indices. In Canada, where regional price 
indices are available, accounting for regional differences in PPPs would reduce the level of regional 
disparities by at least 15% (Albouy, 2005). ECO/WKP(2016)54 12 Box 1. The OECD regional classification In any analytical study conducted at the sub-national level, defining the territorial unit is of prime importance. The 
OECD classification is based on two territorial levels. The higher level (Territorial Level 2 – TL2) consists of 335  " large 
regions " , while the lower level (Territorial Level 3 – TL3) is composed of 1 679  " small regions " . Each TL3 region is 
contained within a TL2 region. All regions are defined within national borders and usually – but not always -correspond 
to administrative jurisdictions. This classification – which, for European countries, is largely consistent with the Eurostat 
classification – helps compare regions at the same territorial level. Table 1. Number and size of OECD TL2 regions, by country Number of

Regional disparities could also be measured in terms of household income per head. This 
measure considers all the sources of revenues received by a resident in a region, including social welfare 
payments. It is an indicator of the fiscal capacity and when considered in terms of disposable income a 
measure of the well-being of citizens. It is not the best indicator for the current analysis, however, because 
it includes social security payments. As noted by Lessmann (2006), this may create a bias when studying ECO/WKP(2016)54 13 the impact of fiscal decentralisation on regional disparities as one policy may influence the other. For this 
reason, and for comparability with the existing literature, regional GDP per capita is used for measuring 
regional disparities. 23. 
Once the geographical scope and the unit of measure are defined, a statistical indicator, which 
synthesises the information on the distribution of regional GDPs needs to be chosen. The most common 
indicator is the coefficient of variation (COV). It is a normalised version of the standard deviation, as 
shown in the equation below, where í µí± is the number of regions, í µí± í µí± is per capita GDP of region i, and í µí¼ is 
the unweighted mean of regional per capita GDPs. í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± = √ 1 
í µí± 
∑ (í µí± í µí± − í µí¼) 2 í µí± 
í µí±=1 í µí¼ 
= 
í µí¼ 
í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± 24. 
The COV requires a distribution with (1) a mean different from zero and (2) that all values are 
positive. Both conditions are met by the use of GDP per capita. The interpretation of the value is in terms 
of percentages with respect to the mean value. For instance, COV=0.03 means that the dispersion of the 
distribution of regional GDPs is 3% of the mean. 25. 
The main advantage of this measure is that it is mean independent, so that it can be easily 
compared across countries. For instance, the COV is independent of the level of GDP, so that countries 
with a different level of GDP can be consistently compared. This is an advantage over other inequality 
measures such as the GINI coefficient and the Theil index, which are affected by the size of the 
distribution and the unit of measure. Furthermore, the COV satisfies the Pigou-Dalton principle (roughly, a 
transfer from a richer to a poorer region should unambiguously reduce the degree of inequality). 26. 
There are, however, two possible sources of concern, when using this indicator. Firstly it is not 
invariant to the number of regions in the country, as it assumes values in the range [0, √í µí± − 1]; secondly, 
it does not take into account the size of the regions, i.e. the disparity is not weighed for the share of the 
population living in each region. 27. 
Some authors (for instance, Lessmann (2006) and Ezcurra and Pascual (2008)) use a population 
weighted version of the COV (wCOV) to control for the distribution of the population over the regions, so 
that the index would reflect less the disparities arising from less populated regions. í µí±¤í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± = √∑ [(í µí± í µí± − í µí¼ í µí± ) 
2  *  í µí± í µí± ] í µí± 
í µí±=1 í µí¼ í µí± The right term under the square root, í µí± í µí± , represents the population share of region i with respect to the 
national population, and í µí¼ í µí± represents the national mean per capita GDP. The population weight reduces 
the importance of less populous regions, so that the index will show a low level of variation even though 
some regions are much poorer than the rest, as long as their population is negligible with respect to the 
country's population. 28. 
This analysis is based on the unweighted COV. Apart from the highlighted benefits of using the 
COV, there are other motives that justify this choice. First, if the analysis aims at measuring economic 
development and regional disparities, there is no reason to give larger regions a higher weight. Second, 
using population weights has the drawback of understating disparities between urban and rural regions, 
where the latter are (by definition) less populated (Spiezia, 2003). And third, the empirical analysis is ECO/WKP(2016)54 14 conducted with country fixed effects, so that the differences arising because of a different number of 
regions should not bias the results. 29. 
Figure 2 shows the level of regional inequality, measured by the COV in 1995, along with the 
change in the indicator of inequality between 1995 and 2011. The plot shows substantial differences in the 
level of the COV among countries and substantial differences also with respect to its evolution. 3 The plot 
suggests that countries with a low COV in 1995 have seen their regional disparities increase in the 1995-
2011 period, while countries with a high COV in 1995 have experienced a reduction in regional disparities. Figure 2. Level and trend in regional inequality

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/region-data-en. 3.1.2. Measuring fiscal decentralisation 30. 
Fiscal decentralisation is a complex phenomenon, which comprises several dimensions (Box 2). 
Measuring the degree of decentralisation of a country is an attempt to summarise in a numerical indicator 
the vertical and horizontal fiscal relationships between different levels of government. It is important to 
account for both the quantitative (as appears in the budgets of sub-national government) aspects of 
decentralisation and the qualitative aspects, such as the actual autonomy and capacity to conduct public 
policies. 31. 
Of particular interest for the present work is the actual mix of revenue and expenditure 
decentralisation. OECD countries all present a share of local spending that is larger than the share of local 
revenues, leading to a so-called vertical fiscal imbalance. The theoretical framework presented in section 2 
highlights the importance of financing expenditure with own taxes in order to provide the incentive to 
implement growth-enhancing policies. 3. 
See the appendix for country details. ECO/WKP(2016)54 15 Box 2. The challenge of measuring fiscal decentralisation The common measure to assess fiscal decentralisation is the share of resources assigned to SCGs. Spending, 
revenue or tax ratios drawn from the OECD National Accounts or OECD Revenue Statistics allow measuring one 
aspect of the extent of sub-central fiscal powers. These ratios, however, only poorly measure the true fiscal discretion 
that SCGs enjoy in practice. On the revenue side, central government may limit tax autonomy, i.e. the ability to set tax 
bases and/or rates, while on the expenditure side, central government regulation may strongly influence SCG 
spending, thereby reducing discretion in setting policy. In some countries, the transfer of financial responsibility hardly 
reflects more than a change in accounting, as essential regulatory power remains at the central level. The traditional 
decentralisation ratios are therefore often inadequate, which becomes apparent once they are used to test how fiscal 
frameworks affect outcomes such as economic growth, efficiency in the provision of services or citizen's satisfaction. In 
recent years, the OECD Fiscal Network has worked on new indicators, focusing on sub-central tax autonomy or on 
sub-central spending power, to complement and improve decentralisation statistics (Kim, Lotz and Blöchliger, 2013). Since intergovernmental fiscal frameworks have many dimensions and since it is difficult to judge ex ante, which 
indicator best reflects the relationship between decentralisation and regional disparities, the various empirical analyses 
presented in this paper use a wide array of indicators. The following four decentralisation indicators are used 
alternatively and, in order to avoid multicollinearity, one by one (sequentially) in otherwise identical equations:  Spending decentralisation (the ratio of sub-central to general government spending);  Revenue decentralisation (the ratio of sub-central own revenue to general government revenue);  Tax revenue decentralisation (the ratio of sub-central tax revenue to general government tax revenue);  Tax autonomy (the ratio of taxes over which SCGs have some base or rate-setting autonomy to general government tax revenue), taken from the OECD Fiscal Decentralisation database. One additional indicators is used:  Fiscal authority, an indicator which accounts for the degree of authority of local governments in setting rates and bases of local taxes. The indicator assumes values from 0 (no authority) to 5 (high authority). This 
indicator is part of a set of regional authority indexes (RAI) aimed at measuring the political, administrative, 
and fiscal authority of sub-national governments. Despite this agnostic view about the relevance and reliability of the various indicators, there is a priori evidence 
that some of them are better than others in reflecting true sub-central fiscal policy autonomy. Revenue shares appear 
to better reflect fiscal and regulatory power than spending shares, because sub-central spending is often financed by 
large transfers with many regulatory strings attached. Institutional indicators that encompass several dimensions of 
policy making are probably best in providing insights into SCGs' actual power. Since institutional indicators provide a 
richer picture of the policy framework than simple spending and revenue ratios, they provide a better basis for specific 
policy guidance. Examples for institutional indicators are the Fiscal Network's tax autonomy indicators or the spending 
power indicators, the latter being available for a few countries only and the fiscal authority index produced within the 
regional authority project (RAI). Source: Blöchliger, H. (2013), "Decentralisation and Economic Growth -Part 1: How Fiscal Federalism Affects Long-Term

For these reasons, not one but several indicators of fiscal decentralisation are considered. The 
most reliable indicator for the empirical analysis are the OECD indicators of tax, revenue and expenditure 
decentralisation, all expressed as share of local with respect to total values (Box 2). The indicator 
measuring the vertical fiscal imbalance is determined as 1 minus the ratio between local revenues and local 
expenditure. Although these (quantitative) indicators may overestimate the actual level of fiscal 
decentralisation, they are used in the present study (as well as in most of the academic works), because 
they are available for most OECD countries over more than twenty years. In order to check for this 
shortcoming of the quantitative indicators, two measure of the actual degree of autonomy are considered: 
the OECD tax autonomy indicator and the fiscal authority index produced within the Regional Authority 
project (Hooghe et al., 2015). ECO/WKP(2016)54 16 3.2. Some stylised facts 3.2.1. Regional inequality 33. 
Regional disparities have slowly risen over the past 15 years. Across the OECD the differences in 
sub-central GDP per capita, as measured by the coefficient of variation, rose from 0.26 to 0.28 between 
1996 and 2013. Most strikingly, rising disparities within OECD countries were accompanied by an even 
more pronounced decline in disparities between these countries. Put in other words, countries are 
converging, while regions are diverging. Only recently have inter-regional disparities begun to shrink 
again. Figure 3. Regional inequality is decreasing between but increasing within countries Note: The indicator OECD within is the coefficient of variation of regional GDP per capita within each country, averaged over the 
OECD countries available in our sample; the indicator OECD between is the coefficient of variation of national GDP per capita 
between those countries. The sample includes 26 OECD countries; among the current member countries the following are excluded: 
Luxembourg and Estonia because of the presence of only one TL2 region; Iceland, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey 
for lack of regional data for the whole period considered.

Statistics (database), DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/region-data-en. 34. 
A similar trend of increasing within country regional disparity emerges also with the use of other 
indicators of variation. As mentioned in section 3.1, the Theil index is not suitable for cross-country 
comparisons because it is subject to changes when the composition of the sample, i.e. number of regions, 
changes. However, it has the advantage of being decomposable into the within and between components of 
inequality. This allows assessing how much of the inequality in regional per capita GDP is due to 
differences between countries and how much to differences within countries. 35. 
Table 2 shows an increase in regional inequality from 0.102 points in 1995 to 0.148 in 2011. The 
decomposition of the index shows that the component of regional inequality explained by within country 
disparities has increased from 42.16% in 1995 to a peak of 53.91 in 2007 – thus showing an increasing 
trend before the global financial crisis – and declining to around 48% by 2011. Garcilazo and Oliveira 
Martins (2013) find a similar trend using the Gini coefficient as the measure of national and regional 
disparities, for the period 1995-2005. In particular, they observe a reduction of the Gini index between 
OECD countries, and an increase of the Gini index of regional GDP within countries. Despite the general ECO/WKP(2016)54 17 increasing trend, there are large cross-country differences, and disparities in 2011 are unrelated with their 
evolution between 1995 and 2011 (Figure 4). Table 2. Decomposition of inequality within and between countries Year

Figure 5 shows that regional disparities are smaller for high income countries, suggesting that 
OECD countries lie on the right-hand side of the bell-shaped relationship similar to the Kuznets curve. 
Williamson (1965) conjectured that regional inequality may follow the same inverted-U relationship as 
income inequality with regional disparities increasing in the first stage of development and then gradually 
declining as the economic benefits of national growth spread to all regions. ECO/WKP(2016)54 18 Figure 5.

The theoretical framework developed in section 2 indicates that one of the main channels through 
which fiscal decentralisation affects regional inequality is the incentive that tax decentralisation provides to 
improve the competitiveness of the region, by competing for external resources and by activating internal 
resources. A preliminary analysis of the data confirms this thesis. Figure 6 presents two plots in which 
regional inequality is related to tax autonomy (left panel) and to the vertical fiscal imbalance (in the right 
panel). The bi-variate association between regional inequality and tax autonomy is indeed negative, 
confirming the hypothesis that more budgetary responsibilities are associated with less regional inequality. 
Similarly, the bi-variate relationship between regional inequality and the fiscal vertical imbalance supports 
the thesis that local spending not financed by own taxation leads to increasing regional disparities. ECO/WKP(2016)54 19 Figure 6. Tax decentralisation is associated with lower disparities, the vertical imbalance with higher ones

Sub-central spending and revenues are mostly unbalanced, and the vertical fiscal imbalance has 
not decreased between 1995 and 2011. As Figure 7 shows, the share of local expenditure is higher than the 
share of local revenues for all OECD countries. Some countries like Iceland and the United States are 
closer to matching local revenues and local spending, while other countries, like Mexico and the 
Netherlands, have a much higher share of local expenditure than local revenue. In countries were the 
vertical fiscal imbalance is large, most public goods and services provided are financed through transfers 
from other levels of government and thus unrelated to the tax base. ECO/WKP(2016)54 20 Figure 7. Vertical fiscal imbalance: Level and evolution Spending is more decentralised than revenue

The empirical analysis is conducted on an unbalanced panel of 30 OECD countries over the 
period 1995-2011. The time period is constrained by the availability of regional data on per capita GDP. 
The period considered, however, spans over more than 15 years allowing for a sufficient time variation to 
capture changes in regional disparities and economic phenomena, such as the great moderation era and the 
following global financial crisis. The dependent variable is the coefficient of variation of regional GDP per 
capita expressed in constant PPP USD. The explanatory variables consist of a set of fiscal decentralisation 
indicators, and a set of control variables that reflect country's characteristics supposed to affect regional 
disparities. The estimations also include country fixed effects to account for all unobserved factors that 
may affect regional inequality other than the control variables, and time dummies to account for common 
shocks, like the recent global financial crisis. 40. 
The econometric model consists of variables at the country level. Regional statistics are only 
used to construct an indicator of regional disparities for each country and every year. The following 
equation was estimated, where the subscript i indicates the country, and t refers to the year, í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí»¼ + βí µí°¹í µí°· í µí±í µí±¡ + γí µí± í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí± + í µí»¿ í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ FD corresponds to the different measures of decentralisation. In some regressions two measures of 
decentralisation are considered at the same time, but in general measures of decentralisation are considered 
one at a time, to avoid problems of multicollinearity. 4 The matrix X represents a set of control variables 
which includes socioeconomic variables, territorial indicators, and public finance indicators. 4. 
Table A.1 in the appendix presents the matrix of bi-lateral correlations between the variables. It shows that 
the correlation between the fiscal decentralisation indicators is quite high. By contrast, the correlation 
between the other explanatory variables is not large. ECO/WKP(2016)54 21 41. 
Fiscal decentralisation is measured by three budgetary indicators, the tax, revenue, and 
expenditure share, and two indicators of fiscal power, the tax autonomy indicator and the Regional 
Authority Index (Box 2). As expected the variation between countries is higher than the variation within 
the same country, but there is still some variation within the same country. Table 3 presents the descriptive 
statistics of the coefficient of variation, the local tax share, the local expenditure share and the local 
revenue share, which show the standard deviation across countries (between) and over time in each country 
(within). Table 3. Descriptive statistics of the main variables of interest Variable

T = 17.6 Note: The total variation (overall) can be decomposed into variation across countries (between) and over time variation for each 
country (within); time invariant regressors have a within standard error equal to zero; and country invariant regressors have a 
between standard error equal to zero. The min and max columns provide information on the minimum and maximum values of the 
overall observations (by country and time), between observations (by country), and within observations (over time). The column 
 " observations "  provides information on the total number of country-time observations N, the number of countries n, and the number of 
periods T (this figure is not an integer because the panel in unbalanced). 42. 
The set of control variables includes the level of GDP per capita and its squared value, supposing 
the level of regional disparity follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with the level of development. 
Spatial inequality has been associated to the process of economic development by Williamson (1965), 
which applied Kutznets's income relationship to geographical inequality. Accordingly, the level of 
regional disparity should rise in the first phase of development, because shocks and some natural factors of 
production are geographically located, and then the diffusion of the development process should reduce 
inequality following an inverted U-relationship. 43. 
Other economic variables that can affect regional disparities are human and physical capital 
investment, testing the hypothesis of a negative relationship between the national level of human and 
physical capital and regional disparities. The share of national valued added in the manufacturing sector is 
also included, as activities linked to the manufacturing sector are less concentrated in metropolitan areas 
than the service sectors. Therefore an economy with a high share of manufacturing is expected to display 
lower regional disparities than an economy mainly based on services. The New Economic Geography 
literature emphasises the role of trade and globalisation for economic development and regional industrial 
specialisation (Fujita et al., 1999). Scholars in this field maintain that opening national markets puts 
regions in direct competition with foreign regions, thus allowing access to more markets. In view of these 
considerations trade openness measured as the sum of exports and imports divided by national GDP is 
included. ECO/WKP(2016)54 22 44. 
Territorial variables can also affect regional inequality. The distribution of people and firms over 
the national territory may determine the emergence of agglomeration economies in some areas. The 
concentration of people and firms is beneficial to economic development as it increases productivity, 
although the impact on regional disparities is ambiguous (OECD, 2014). If economic activities are 
concentrated in a few regions, the gap with other regions would tend to increase. By contrast, within each 
region the concentration of factors of production in few locations may decrease regional disparities. In 
order to account for agglomeration effects, two indicators are included in the analysis: the share of the 
population living in urban areas, and the degree of geographical concentration of the population. The latter 
index is of particular importance as it captures the total concentration of a country's population in each 
region with respect to the regional surface area. 45. 
Finally, an indicator of the size of the public sector is also considered. Countries with a larger 
public sector may be better able to tackle regional disparities (Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra, 2010), 
although it might also induce greater corruption (Tanzi, 1998), thus raising regional inequality. 46.

The econometric model is estimated using a fixed effect estimator (FE) with clustered standard 
errors and time dummies. The analysis is first conducted on a baseline model, where three different 
indicators of fiscal decentralisation are considered, as well as an indicator of the vertical fiscal imbalance. 
The model is then extended with the inclusion of indicators of local tax autonomy, specific local taxes, and 
specific expenditure functions. A final section discusses the robustness of the estimation results. 4.1. Baseline results 48.

The analysis considers the three main indicators of fiscal decentralisation separately in the first 
three columns, expenditure decentralisation and the vertical fiscal imbalance together in column 4, and the 
impact of the vertical fiscal imbalance in column 5. The estimation results show that both tax 
decentralisation and revenue decentralisation reduce regional disparities, although only the tax share is 
statistically significant. These results are in line with the theoretical framework, suggesting that the more 
the SCG budget is funded by revenues coming from the local economy the higher the incentive to promote 
regional growth. Moreover the question arises, whether revenue decentralisation benefits lagging regions 
more than high income regions. Answering this question will be the focus of section 5.2. 50. 
The evidence on the spending side shows that expenditure decentralisation and the vertical fiscal 
imbalance have both a statistically significant and positive sign when estimated separately, but when taken 
together they have no longer a significant impact on regional disparity. In fact, the estimation results of an 
instrumental variable model (Table 8) shows that only the coefficient associated with the vertical fiscal 
imbalance is statistically significant. This suggests that the vertical fiscal imbalance rather than expenditure 
decentralisation affects regional disparities. Furthermore, weak 5 evidence is provided also by the 
estimation of a model in which expenditure decentralisation and its interaction with the vertical fiscal 
imbalance are considered (Table A3). The estimation results show that when the interaction term is 
considered the coefficient associated with expenditure decentralisation is negative, but not statistically 
significant, while the coefficient of the interaction term is positive and statistically significant. 51. 
The control variables have the expected sign. 6 In particular, economic development, measured by 
the country's GDP per capita and its square, displays a statistically significant concave relationship with 
regional disparities. The coefficient associated with the level of GDP per capita is positive while the square 
is negative, providing evidence for an increasing and concave relationship of regional disparities with the 
economic development of a country. The coefficient associated with physical capital formation is negative 
and significant, suggesting that investment (even aggregated at the country level) tends to reduce regional 
disparities. Also the share of manufacturing value added significantly reduces regional disparities, as 
manufacturing activities tend to be less geographically concentrated than those of the service sector. Trade 
openness tends to increase disparities, but is not statistically significant in most cases. Population size 
increases regional disparities, as it is a proxy for the size of the country and larger countries tend to display 
wider regional disparities. By contrast, the more the population is geographically concentrated the lower 
are regional disparities, suggesting a positive effect of agglomeration forces. Finally, the size of 
government, measured by total government expenditure as a ratio of GDP, tends to increase regional 
disparities. This is contrary to the widespread view that a bigger government (more public spending) 
should reduce inequality between regions. 52. 
The message stemming from the analysis is that the way decentralisation is achieved, matters for 
regional disparities. For instance, an increase of 10 percentage points in the share of SCG revenues is 
associated with a reduction of regional disparities by 4 basis points of the COV, or an 11% decrease if the 
COV is evaluated at the mean value (0.36). Similarly a reduction of 10 percentage points of the fiscal 
vertical imbalance is associated with a reduction of regional disparities by 1 basis point of the COV, or a 
4% decrease. Clearly a reduction of the vertical fiscal imbalance can be achieved also in case of an 
increase of sub-central spending, as long as it is matched by a greater increase in sub-central revenues. 5. 
Those results are weak because the model is estimated without country and time fixed effects. 6. 
Although not reported, a specification of the baseline model with the level of unemployment among the 
control variables was also estimated. The associated coefficient, however, is never statistically significant 
and does not change the estimated coefficients of the other explanatory variables. ECO/WKP(2016)54 25 4.2. Extending the baseline model 53. 
The results of the baseline model are confirmed by the inclusion of some indicators of the degree 
of autonomy in taxation and the inclusion of specific taxes and expenditure functions. Table 5 presents the 
results of the estimation of the baseline model with these indicators. The impact of fiscal autonomy on 
regional inequality is negative and statistically significant. In particular, both measures of autonomy (fiscal 
authority from the RAI dataset, and tax autonomy from the OECD Fiscal network dataset) confirm the 
importance of local taxation for reducing regional inequality. 54. 
This result suggests that providing local governments with fiscal autonomy does not increase 
disparities, as suggested by part of the economic literature. It rather provides an incentive to increase the 
tax base by attracting more firms and people and implementing business friendly policies. 55. 
A finer distinction of the type of local tax does not add much to the analysis. Table 6 (column 3 
and 4) shows that both local income and property taxes reduce regional inequality, although not 
statistically significant. Likewise, the distinction of local spending into social welfare spending and 
education related spending does not provide any further insight. Table 6 (column 5 and 6) shows that the 
coefficient associated with social welfare spending is positive as well as the coefficient associated with 
education spending – the latter is not statistically significant, though. Overall the impact of national GDP 
per capita (and its square value) on regional disparities is the same as in the baseline model, confirming the 
inverted-U relationship. ECO/WKP(2016)54 26 Table 6. Estimation results: Refined measures of fiscal decentralisation Dependent variable: coefficient of variation of regional GDP per capita

Some studies have shown that the impact of fiscal decentralisation on regional disparities may 
differ in rich and poor countries (e.g., Lessmann, 2009). In order to control for this possibility a separate 
model has been estimated. 7 The results however show no statistically significance difference of the impact 7. 
Estimation results of a model with the fiscal decentralisation variables interacted with some of the control 
variables (including the GDP per capita) are available upon request. ECO/WKP(2016)54 27 of Fiscal decentralisation in countries with different level of GDP; that is, the interaction term is not 
significantly different from zero. This might be due to the focus on OECD countries, which reduces the 
differences in terms of GDP per capita. 57. 
In order to account for institutional quality the baseline model is extended with indicators which 
capture different aspects of institutional quality. These are perception-based indicators collected by the 
World Bank within the project  " Worldwide Governance Indicators – WGI "  (Kaufmann et al., 2010). The 
indicators are supposed to capture the way in which public expenditure is managed at the local level. Three 
indicators are considered: corruption, rule of law and government effectiveness. The first two indicators 
capture the  " respect "  of citizens and public officials of the institutions and norms that govern economic 
activities. The level of corruption is a main candidate for a negative impact of expenditure decentralisation 
on regional inequality (Tanzi, 1996). Government effectiveness is supposed to capture the quality of public 
services. A composite indicator of institutional quality (quality) is constructed by taking the arithmetic 
mean of the three indicators. 58. 
Table 7 shows that the most important indicator is corruption, which tends to increase regional 
disparities. The other institutional variables as well as the respective interaction terms are not significant. 
Interestingly, when corruption is included in the analysis the coefficient of expenditure decentralisation 
becomes negative, although no longer statistical significant. Overall, the non-significance of most of the 
indicators of government quality suggests that the impact of fiscal decentralisation on regional inequality is 
largely independent of the quality of the government in OECD countries. The low statistical significance of 
the estimated coefficient can also be due to one of the major caveats of using these perception-based 
indicators: the lack of consistency over time, due to the change in the composition of the indicators 
(Furceri and Mourougane, 2010). Table 7. Institutional quality, expenditure decentralisation and regional disparities VARIABLES

The results of the analysis might suffer from a problem of reverse causality. The econometric 
model assumes that the level of decentralisation within a country affects the level of regional disparities. 
However, it could be argued that disparities may trigger a process of decentralisation, as persistent 
inequality between regions may lead to political movements that advocate more independence. In order to 
test for endogeneity, the previous econometric analysis is replicated using an instrumental variable 
approach, where the lagged values of the fiscal decentralisation indicators are used as instruments. The 
idea is that current levels of regional inequality should not affect past levels of decentralisation, so that the 
correlation found in the analysis should go from decentralisation to regional inequality. 60. 
The estimation results shown in Table 8 confirm the main results of the baseline model. All 
coefficients maintain the same sign and statistical significance is actually increased for most of the 
coefficients. Column 3, in particular, shows that when expenditure decentralisation is estimated along with 
the vertical fiscal imbalance only the latter is statistically significant. Table 8. Instrumental variable results confirm the baseline model VARIABLES (1)

The estimation results for the impact of the vertical fiscal imbalance may also suffer from a 
particular variant of reverse causality. Countries that are characterised by higher disparities may put in 
place a larger transfer scheme from the central government to the lagging regions. Hence, the effect of the 
vertical fiscal imbalance would just be the result of the initial high level of regional disparities. This ECO/WKP(2016)54 29 concern, however, is partly accounted for by the nature of the fixed effect estimator. The estimated 
coefficient is not just the result of a cross-country comparison, but mainly of within country (i.e., over 
time) comparison. In this sense, the estimated coefficients reflect also the change over time of the 
variables, thus suggesting that, regardless of the initial level of regional disparities, an increase of the 
vertical fiscal imbalance does increase regional disparities. Nevertheless, as a further robustness check, the 
impact of regional disparities on transfers is estimated – i.e., transfers are treated as the dependent variable, 
while regional disparities are included among the explanatory variables. This regression analysis shows 
that regional disparities have no statistically significant impact on transfers, thus supporting the hypothesis 
that the vertical fiscal imbalance does increase regional disparities. 8 62. 
The estimation results are also robust to a different indicator of economic performance, GDP per 
worker. This indicator captures labour productivity and better reflects the economic potential of the region. 
Productivity was not used in the baseline model because data are available for a limited number of years 
and countries. The estimation results show that revenue decentralisation reduces between region 
differences in labour productivity. 63. 
The results of the baseline model may be affected by the particular time period considered (1995-
2011). This period is characterised by an initial phase of generalised economic expansion which 
culminated with the outburst of the global financial crisis in 2007, leading to the subsequent period of 
recession and subdued recovery. In order to control for this possible bias, the econometric model is 
estimated over two sub-periods: pre-crisis (1995-2008) and post-crisis (2008-2011). The estimation results 
provide similar figures for the two sub-periods, suggesting that the crisis hardly changed the link between 
fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities (results are available upon request). 64. 
Regional disparities display some degree of persistence over time. This may create some 
problems of autocorrelation. In order to assess this problem, the Woolridge test for autocorrelation in panel 
data was conducted (Woolridge, 2002). It shows that there is not a big problem as the null hypothesis of 
absence of autocorrelation can be accepted at the 5% significant level. Nevertheless, a dynamic 
specification of the baseline model is estimated, where the one year lag of the dependent variable is 
included among the explanatory variables. The estimation strategy is based on the corrected Least Square 
Dummy Variable (LSDVC) estimator proposed by Bruno (2005). This estimator can be used in the 
presence of an unbalanced panel with a small number of individuals (i.e. countries in this case). The 
estimation results confirm the baseline model. Although most of the variables lose significance, which is 
captured by the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable, the coefficient associated with revenue 
decentralisation is still negative and significant at the 10% level (Table A.5 in the appendix). 65. 
A single country, which experienced a large change in either fiscal decentralisation or regional 
disparity or both, may drive the estimation results. In order to rule out this possibility, the estimation of the 
baseline model has been conducted with the exclusion of one country at a time. The baseline results were 
confirmed. 66. 
Finally, the estimation results could be affected by the type of indicator used to measure regional 
disparity. As argued in the text, the coefficient of variation is the most common indicator used in this type 
of analysis. As a robustness check, the Gini index of within countries disparities is used as the dependent 
variable. The estimation results reported in Table A.4 in the appendix confirm the results of the baseline 
model, suggesting that the results are not driven by the choice of the statistical indicator summarising the 
distribution of regional output. Furthermore, the baseline model is also estimated using the weighted 
coefficient of variation as measure of regional disparity – i.e., the coefficient of variation is calculated 8. 
Detailed estimation results are available upon request. ECO/WKP(2016)54 30 taking into account the population size of each region, so that GDP per capita of the most populous regions 
has a higher weight than the GDP per capita of scarcely populated regions. The main results remain valid. 5. Further analysis 67. 
The analysis so far has shown the importance of tax decentralisation and a balanced fiscal 
structure for regional convergence but did not focus on whether the reduction of inequality is due to a 
catching up process which sees relatively poorer regions improving their economic situation, or because of 
the decline of relatively rich regions. In order to shed light on this issue, the empirical analysis is replicated 
using as dependent variable various percentile ratios. Furthermore, a growth regression is conducted on 
various percentile ratios of the distribution of regional per capita GDP, in order to assess whether the 
impact of decentralisation is stronger in richer or poorer regions. 5.1. The effect of decentralisation on percentile ratios 68. 
Table 9 reports the FE estimation of two econometric models in which the dependent variable is 
the 75/25 percentile ratio and the 90/10 percentile ration, respectively. These indicators capture the effect 
of fiscal decentralisation on the top and the bottom of the distribution of regional GDP within each 
country. Table 9. Decentralisation and percentile ratios: 75/25 and 90/10 Ratio 75/25

(0.449) Note: Coefficients are derived from multi-variate regressions linking the coefficient of variation of regional GDP per capita in a country 
to the decentralisation indicators and a set of control variables. Decentralisation indicators are inserted sequentially in the equations. 
The analysis includes all the control variables as in the baseline model. Property tax refers to the share with respect to total tax 
revenues. 69. 
As shown in Table 9, the estimation results are similar to the baseline model, with the indicators 
of tax and revenue decentralisation reducing the ratio between the top and the bottom of the distribution. 
Interestingly, the magnitude of the effect is greater for the 90/10 percentile ratio, hinting at a bigger effect 
of decentralisation on the extremes of the regional per capita GDP distribution. 70. 
Overall these results suggest that the reduction of regional disparities is guided by either a strong 
positive effect on the lagging regions or a depressing effect on the top-performing regions. In other words, ECO/WKP(2016)54 31 the reduction of disparities can be the result of a catching up process or a relative decline in the 
performance of the top regions. An example of the latter phenomenon is provided by countries badly 
affected by the global financial crisis and the subsequent great recession (like Greece), where the reduction 
of regional disparities is probably driven by the drop in GDP experienced by the capital region. 5.2. Catching-up or slowing down? 71. 
The empirical analysis conducted so far suggests that revenue decentralisation reduces regional 
disparities. It is still not clear, however, what part of the regional distribution is most affected by 
decentralisation, and in which way. A reduction of regional disparities is consistent with both a negative 
performance of regions with the highest GDP per capita (top regions), or a positive performance of the 
regions with the lowest GDP per capita (bottom regions). In both cases, within countries regional 
disparities would decrease. 72. 
In order to shed some light on this important issue, the analysis shifts from regional disparities to 
regional convergence. In order to assess whether within country convergence comes from the catching up 
of low income regions or from the bad performance of income rich regions, a separate sample of rich and 
poor regions is constructed. These two samples are constructed by taking the regional GDP per capita level 
of the top and bottom 25 th percentile of the distribution of regional outcome within each country. In other 
words, the original dataset is split into a sub-sample consisting of the top performing regions within each 
country and a sub-sample of the lagging regions within each country. 73. 
The empirical strategy consists in estimating the impact of fiscal decentralisation on the 
economic growth of the two sets of regions, separately. The econometric model is represented by the 
following equation: ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡ − ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡−1 = í µí± + í µí»½ 1 í µí°¹í µí°· í µí±(í µí±¡−1) + í µí»½ 2 ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡−1 + í µí»½ 3 í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí»¼ í µí± + í µí»¾ í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ where ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡ represents the natural log of per capita GDP of the top (bottom) 25 th percentile in country i at 
time t; í µí°¹í µí°· í µí±í µí±¡ represents fiscal decentralisation indicators for country i at time t-1; í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ is a set of control 
variables – similar to the baseline model; í µí»¼ í µí± and í µí»¾ í µí±¡ represent country and time fixed effects; í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ is the error 
term. 74. 
The left hand side of the econometric equation represents the growth rate of the top (bottom) per 
capita GDP in each country for the period 1995-2011. This is supposed to be affected by the lagged value 
of GDP per capita (ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡−1 ), and the lagged value of fiscal decentralisation measures. The coefficient í µí»½ 2 
accounts for the catching up hypothesis originated from Solow's growth model, that is low income 
countries (regions in our case) should growth faster than high income ones. In the current empirical 
specification this parameter accounts for between country convergence among the richest (poorest) regions 
in each country. 75. 
The focus of the analysis is on the estimation of í µí»½ 1 under the two distinct sets of regional GDP 
levels. If the channels through which fiscal decentralisation reduces within countries regional disparity is 
greater incentive for low income regions to use their resources, we would expect í µí»½ 1 to be larger for the 
bottom 25 th percentile than for the top income regions. 76. 
Since the econometric estimate includes the lagged value of GDP as explanatory variables, the 
estimation of this model incurs a problem of serial correlation of the error term. For this reason GDP is 
instrumented with its 2 and 3 year lagged values (Acemoglu et al., 2006). The instrumental variable two 
stage least square (IV 2SLS) estimation results are reported in Table 10. ECO/WKP(2016)54 32 77. 
The estimation results show that the one year lagged value of subnational tax share positively 
affects the growth rate of both set of regions; however, it is larger in magnitude and statistical significance 
for the bottom regions. The coefficient of revenue decentralisation is never significant, while the 
coefficient associated with sub-central fiscal authority is positive and highly significant only for the bottom 
25 th percentile regions. 78. 
As regards expenditure decentralisation, the estimated impact on the regional growth rate is 
positive for both sets of regions. The magnitude of the estimated coefficients, however, reveals that the 
positive impact on economic growth is larger in the high income regions than in the bottom ones. This 
provides some evidence for a role of expenditure decentralisation in increasing regional disparities. 79. 
In line with the theoretical framework (section 2), this result provides evidence that lagging 
regions can benefit more than richer regions from tax decentralisation. The responsibility to raise tax 
revenue in order to finance local spending provides a strong incentive to attract resources and activate local 
ones. However, while the first channel (competing for resources) should work in the same way in top and 
bottom income regions, the second channel (activating unused resources) is likely to produce a higher 
marginal benefit in lagging regions where the scope for activating resources is larger. ECO/WKP(2016)54 33 Table 10. Impact of decentralisation on the top and bottom 25

20 Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The dependent variable in models 1-4 is the growth rate 
of the bottom 25 th percentile of the distribution of regional per capita GDP (gb); the dependent variable of the models 5-8 is the growth 
rate of the top 25 th percentile of the distribution of regional per capita GDP (gt). Lnbottom and Lntop represent the bottom 25 th and top 
25 th GDP per capita in natural logs; the notation  " L.variable name "  represents the variable lagged value. 5.3. Differences in productivity seem to determine regional disparities 80. 
Regional GDP per capita can be decomposed into three factors: GDP per worker; the 
employment rate and the activity rate. This factor decomposition reveals that the main driver of differences 
in regional GDP per capita is differences in productivity (Figure 8). Employment and activity rates are 
much more evenly distributed, suggesting that productivity is the main determinant of differences in GDP 
per capita (OECD, 2015). Exceptions to this pattern are Italy and Spain, where employment differs widely 
across regions, and Japan, where the active population is concentrated in few jurisdictions. More work is 
necessary to determine, how fiscal decentralisation affects each channel. ECO/WKP(2016)54 34 Figure 8. Differences in productivity drive regional disparities Coefficient of variation of each factor, contribution to total variation, 2010 Note: The variation of regional GDP per capita is decomposed into the contributions of labour productivity (GDP per worker), labour 
resource utilisation (those employed as a share of the active working population) and the activity rate (per cent of the active working 
population in total population). Since the relationship between GDP and its components is multiplicative, the variability of each 
component does not exactly add up to the variability of GDP per capita. Source:

Decentralisation database). SCG revenue share: Ratio of sub-central government revenues (including taxes) in total revenues (Source: 
Fiscal Decentralisation database). SCG expenditure share: Ratio of sub-central government spending over total spending of the public sector 
(Source: Fiscal Decentralisation database). Vertical fiscal imbalance: Indicator calculated as (1 − í µí±í µí° ¶í µí°º í µí±í µí°¸í µí± 
í µí±í µí° ¶í µí°º í µí°¸í µí±í µí± ), where SCG REV represents the amount of revenues at the sub-central level, and SCG EXP represents the amount of spending at the sub-central level 
(Source: Fiscal Decentralisation database). Tax autonomy: Ratio of tax revenue over which SCGs have some autonomy in setting the base and/or rate 
over total tax revenue. Since observations are only available for 1995, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011, a panel 
variable has been created by interpolation (Source: OECD Fiscal Decentralisation Database). Fiscal authority: Indicator of the regional authority in setting tax rates and bases independently from the 
central government. It goes from 0 (no fiscal power) to 4 (regional government can set both the rate and 
the base of at least one major tax). Data are from the Regional Authority Index database which aggregates 
annual scores from 231 regional government/tiers in 65 countries for the period 1950-2010. The indicator 
is for the national level, obtained by the aggregation of regional scores, weighted by the regional 
population (Hooghe et al. 2015). Local income tax ratio: Ratio of sub-central income tax revenue in total income tax revenue, covering 35 
OECD countries for the period 1990-2010 (Source: OECD Tax Revenue Statistics). Property tax ratio: Ratio between the revenue from property taxation and the total tax revenue (Source: 
OECD Tax Revenue Statistics). This indicator is included because in most OECD countries the property 
tax is mainly a sub-central government tax, which although not always under the complete authority of the 
sub-central government, it does contribute substantially to the local budget. Local welfare spending, local education spending: Ratio of the sub-central spending to the total spending 
in the respective COFOG spending area (Source: OECD COFOG Database (SNA 93)). Data cover 24 
OECD countries for the period 1995-2012. Control variables GDP per capita: National GDP per capita measured in constant PPP USD (base year 2005) (Source: 
OECD National Accounts database) Human capital: Indicator based on the average years of schooling by country (Source: OECD Analytical 
Database). ECO/WKP(2016)54 39 Gross capital formation: Annual gross capital formation as share of GDP (Source: World Bank WDI 
database). Trade openness: Sum of the value of exports and imports of goods and services divided by the country's 
GDP (Source: OECD Analytical Database). Share of VA in manufacturing: Value added in the manufacturing sector as share of national GDP (Source: 
World Bank WDI database). Urbanisation: Share of urban population over total population. Urban population refers to people living in 
urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank population 
estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects (World Bank WDI 
database). Population concentration: See Section A2 below. Public debt: Central government debt as a share of GDP (Source: World Bank WDI database). Government expenditure: Consolidated government expenditure as a share of GDP (Source: OECD Fiscal 
Decentralisation database) A2. Geographic Concentration Index 81. 
The index of geographic concentration of the population for a country with N regions is 
calculated as the following expression: ∑ |í µí± í µí± − í µí± í µí± | í µí± 
í µí±=1 2 where p represents the population share of region i with respect to the country's population; a represents 
the surface area of region i with respect to the total surface of the country. For each region the indicator 
takes the absolute value of the difference between the two shares and sums over all regions. Data are from 
the OECD Regions and Cities database. 82. 
The indicator is based on the idea that an evenly (not concentrated) distribution of a country's 
population over the territory is achieved when the regional share of population and surface area coincide. 
In this case the index has value zero. By contrast, when the regional population share is larger than the 
surface area, the indicator assumes values greater than zero. The numerator is divided by two as for any 
region in which the population share is higher than the surface area share there must be a  " complementary "  
region with the exact opposite condition. A3. Bi-variate correlation matrix among the variables used in the econometric model 83. 
Table A.1 shows that the different indicators of fiscal decentralisation are correlated, thus 
supporting the choice of presenting results in which they are used in isolation. The correlation matrix also 
shows that the pair-wise correlations between the other explanatory variables are not large. ECO/WKP(2016)54 40 Table A.1. Correlation matrix COV

1 ECO/WKP(2016)54 41 A4. SCG expenditure share and vertical fiscal imbalance 84. 
The impact of spending decentralisation on regional disparities seems to be driven by the way in 
which such expenditure are financed. Table A.2 (column 4) shows that when estimating a 2SLS 
instrumental variable model, only the coefficient associated with vertical fiscal imbalance remains 
significant. Table A.2. Spending and vertical fiscal imbalance, FE and IV estimation VARIABLES

20 Note: The first three columns are the estimation of the baseline model with fixed effect and time dummies; the forth column 
presents the estimation results of the 2SLS IV estimation of the baseline model, where 2 and 3 year lag of the SCG expenditure 
share and of the vertical fiscal imbalance are used. Standard errors in parentheses; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. 85. 
The relationship between spending and the vertical fiscal imbalance can also be investigated with 
the creation of an interaction term. The sign of this indicator would show the importance of financing 
additional local expenditure with local revenues. Table A.3 presents the results of FE estimation, without 
year fixed effects and robust standard errors. If year fixed effects and robust standard errors are considered 
the coefficients are no longer statistically significant, although still with the same sign. ECO/WKP(2016)54 42 Table A.3. Estimation results, interaction SCG expenditure share and vertical fiscal imbalance VARIABLES

The importance of the financing channel for SCG spending is highlighted by the chart in 
Figure A.1, where the SCG share of tax revenue is plotted against the SCG share of spending in economic 
related affairs. Figure A.1. Positive correlation between spending on economic affairs and SCG tax revenue share 1995-2011 Note: Values are shares of local with respect to total taxes or spending. Each dot represents one country in a specific year. Source: Own elaboration on data from OECD national accounts database and OECD Fiscal Decentralisation Database, 
http://www.oecd.org/tax/federalism/oecdfiscaldecentralisationdatabase.htm. A7. Dynamic specification of the baseline model 88. 
Table A.5 presents the results of the estimation of a dynamic model, where the lagged dependent 
variable is included among the explanatory variables. This model specification takes into account that the 
value of regional disparities is persistent over time, i.e. the value in a given year is mainly determined by 
the value in the previous year. 89. 
The results of the estimation show that the main variables of interest maintain the same sign 
although they tend to lose statistical significance. This is because most of the yearly change (about 70%) is 
explained by the lagged value of the same indicator. The only statistically significant coefficient is the 
impact of revenue decentralisation, suggesting that the main impact on regional disparity is determined by 
the decentralisation of revenue to the sub-national level. ECO/WKP(2016)54 45 Table A.5. Estimation results of the dynamic specification of the model Dependent variable: COV of GDP per capita (1)

Controlling for government 
quality reduces the 
economic impact of fiscal 
decentralisation on regional 
disparities. Fiscal 
decentralisation reduces 
regional disparities in high 
government quality countries 
and widens disparities in low 
government quality 
countries.
