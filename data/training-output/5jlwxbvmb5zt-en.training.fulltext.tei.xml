			<head>................................................... 76<lb/> 1 INTRODUCTION -ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRACTING AND KEEPING TALENT<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> European economies have always been subject to change over time. Some changes were of a<lb/> short-term nature and occurred as negative shocks, sending economies into recession. Other changes<lb/> manifested themselves as medium-or long-term trends. An important evolution, belonging to the second<lb/> category, is the increasing importance of knowledge-based processes in all developed economies. The<lb/> input factor &apos;knowledge&apos;, human capital, contributes more and more to productivity in European<lb/> economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Although EU member states experienced rather heterogeneous economic development since the<lb/> early 2000s, there remains one striking similarity: the relative share of tertiary educated individuals<lb/> employed in science and technology surged between 2002 and 2012. This development is primarily driven<lb/> by a rising absolute number of highly skilled individuals in these occupations. Consequently, European<lb/> economies now rely more than ever on the supply of high skilled labour.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Tertiary educated employees in science and technology as percentage of the total active<lb/> population, 2012 and 2002.<lb/> Source: Eurostat, own representation<lb/> Note:<lb/> EU 27 refers to all current members but Croatia.<lb/> 1 Footnote by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to «Cyprus» relates to the southern part of the Island.<lb/></figure>

			<p>There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognizes the Turkish<lb/> Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of United Nations, Turkey shall<lb/> preserve its position concerning the &quot; Cyprus issue &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<figure>Footnote by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union: The Republic of Cyprus is recognized<lb/> by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in this document relates to the area under the<lb/> effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. &quot;<lb/></figure>

			<p>3.<lb/> This dependence is likely to increase further as the evolution of knowledge-based economies<lb/> proceeds. To meet this rising demand, and to foster innovativeness, EU economies have to invest in the<lb/> formation of human capital -the &apos;brains&apos; of the future labour force.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Demographic constraints however, already looming at the horizon, will limit the maximal<lb/> possible supply of &apos;brains&apos; the EU will be able to generate, even with increases in the share of youth who<lb/> are tertiary-educated. To ensure that knowledge-fuelled EU economies will not suffer a fuel shortage in the<lb/> near future, some short-acting measures might be required.<lb/> &quot; I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow. &quot;<lb/> Woodrow T. Wilson, 28 th president of the USA, 1856-1924<lb/> 5.<lb/> In this spirit, attracting third country workers to the EU is one potential approach. But what if<lb/> these migration streams are too small, or there still remains a qualification mismatch? To prevent this<lb/> issue, initiatives have been launched, such as the EU Blue Card, designed specifically to attract high-<lb/>skilled labour. However, resulting inflows might still be insufficient.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Recent trends, i.e. the jump in the number of asylum seekers from 261 thousand in 2010 to 628<lb/> thousand<lb/> in<lb/> 2014<lb/> 2<lb/></p>

			<p>, indicate that actual inflows into the EU could mitigate the demographic constraint, depending on whether<lb/> the majority of these migrants stay temporarily or permanently. In any case, the distribution of these new<lb/> immigrants across European member states is not proportional to their labour market size. At the same<lb/> time, educational background and occupational skill sets of these new arrivals, already acquired abroad, are<lb/> heterogeneous.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Aside from workers who completed education and vocational training abroad there is another<lb/> group of temporary migrants, namely international students. Their number reached in 2012 an all-time high<lb/> of almost 1.5 million enrolled students 3 , indicating that the EU remains one of the main destinations for<lb/> studying abroad (see <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>. 1in the appendix).<lb/> 8.<lb/> In 2012, 500 thousand of the 1.46 million of international students in the EU were students<lb/> from another EU country. Hence, almost two-thirds of all international students in the EU came from<lb/> countries outside the EU -they constitute potentially a substantial pool of well-educated and highly-skilled<lb/> future workers. Beyond their formal qualifications they also acquired additional cultural and social capital<lb/> as well as language skills during their years of study in the EU. All these aspects speak in favour of a<lb/> smooth integration into an EU labour market. Moreover, by their initial choice of studying in the EU they<lb/> already demonstrated that the EU has a certain appeal on them.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Whereas all major destinations hosted in 2012 distinctly more internationally mobile students<lb/> than five years ago, the three major destinations attracted slightly smaller shares (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>)</p>

			<figure>. Compared to<lb/> 2007, students gravitated more frequently towards the Russian Federation and China. A noteworthy shift in<lb/> 2<lb/> Figures are rounded, extracted from Eurostat tables on &apos;Asylum and Managed Migration&apos;.<lb/> 3<lb/> Total stock numbers (3.85 million in 2012, 2.83 million in 2007) are below the figures reported in OECD<lb/> (2013). This is related to the underlying statistical concept – here international students, in case of OECD<lb/> (2013) foreign students.<lb/> relative enrolment figures occurred also in favour of other economies in South East Asia, namely the<lb/> Republic of Korea, Malaysia or Thailand.<lb/> Figure 2. Relative attractiveness expressed as Top-10 destination shares<lb/> Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation<lb/> Note:<lb/> * includes Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau<lb/> ** most recent values from 2011 instead of 2012<lb/></figure>

			<p>10.<lb/> In an increasingly interconnected and globalised world, students in tertiary education face a<lb/> growing number of potentially attractive destinations to study abroad. One of the essential questions in the<lb/> decades to come is how the EU could manage to remain among the top destinations for international<lb/> students in a world increasingly competing for highly-skilled labour. Another central question in this<lb/> context was how to turn effectively the potential of international students into real gains from an EU<lb/> perspective? Alternatively, referring to the above-noted quotation, one could ask how many brains could<lb/> be borrowed, under which circumstances and how to proceed to retain these talents for a longer time?<lb/> These questions constitute the main research questions guiding this report and defining its structure.<lb/> 11.<lb/> In order to highlight students&apos; initial preferences, and a possible interconnectedness with<lb/> subsequent staying behaviour, chapter 2 provides an overview over the distribution of internationally<lb/> mobile students in the EU. The descriptive analysis sheds light on absolute numbers, as well as relative<lb/> numbers in relation to total enrolment. Internationally mobile students&apos; preferences are presented based on<lb/> country (or region) of origin, sex, as well as level and field of study. Aside from a status quo assessment in<lb/> the year 2012, some changes over time are highlighted as well.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Chapter 3 is dedicated to the introduction of a measure for international students&apos; staying<lb/> behaviour – the so-called &apos;stay rate&apos;. Main findings from the literature are synthesised, including both<lb/> academic and administrative reports. A meta-study on internationally mobile academics served as starting<lb/> point for the exploratory study, presented in the extended version of this paper (<ref type="biblio">Weisser, 2015a</ref>). This<lb/> methodological paper focuses on the derivation of suitable statistics and a detailed empirical assessment of<lb/> staying patterns of internationally mobile students in the EU and its member countries, eventually<lb/> indicating &apos;plausibility bands&apos; for stay rates on the EU level. The main findings, together with a short<lb/> discussion of related core issue, will be briefly summarised in chapter 4.1 of this report.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Yet, the exploratory study&apos;s summary is not to be seen as an end in itself, but rather as<lb/> foundation for an examination of determinants of staying behaviour in two alternative econometric<lb/> frameworks in the remainder of chapter 4. This empirical evaluation is followed by an analysis of potential<lb/> labour market and fiscal consequences and a discussion of implications of changing staying behaviour in<lb/> chapter 5. Based on the previously conducted empirical analyses, chapter 6 deduces some policy<lb/> recommendations. The concluding chapter 7 provides a summary of all previous chapters&apos; essential<lb/> findings.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 DISTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONALLY MOBILE STUDENTS IN THE EU<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> From an a priori point of view, the attractiveness of the EU Higher Education Area 4 could be<lb/> one of the most crucial determinants of post-graduation staying behaviour. Only those graduates who chose<lb/> studying in the European Union in the first place can then in a subsequent decision opt for a prolonged stay<lb/> and entry into the European labour market. Consequently, it is not only important to understand what<lb/> makes students staying in a host country after graduation, but also why they came in the beginning, from<lb/> where they originated and which destinations they have chosen.<lb/> 15.<lb/> The decision to study abroad, being part of individual investment in human capital, depends not<lb/> only on intrinsic motivation but also on the educational landscape in the country of origin.<lb/> 16.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows how &apos;outbound mobility ratios&apos; vary across countries. This measure indicates<lb/> how many students study abroad in relation to all students enrolled in the respective country of origin. In<lb/> roughly 50 percent of all countries, this ratio is at least five percent. Especially smaller economies, with<lb/> smaller tertiary educational sectors often display an outbound ratio of more than 10 percent.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Outbound mobility ratio in 2012, by country of origin<lb/></figure>

			<p>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation<lb/> Note:<lb/> Outbound mobility ratio defined as &apos;Number of students from a given country studying abroad, expressed as a percentage of<lb/> total tertiary enrolment in that country&apos;.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Switching the perspective to the EU as a major destination region, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> displays the<lb/> percentage changes regarding the number of internationally mobile students 5 enrolled between 2002 and<lb/> 2012 by country of origin. Though on average, the EU hosted more internationally mobile students than<lb/> ever, the emerging picture points to a somehow heterogeneous trend. Whilst the number of internationally<lb/> mobile students originating from some countries, for example China and India, more than tripled, other<lb/> countries of origin sent in 2012 distinctly fewer students than one decade ago.<lb/> 18.<lb/> What are the reasons for these mixed developments -are they related to changing host or source<lb/> country conditions? Did changing students&apos; preferences or the structure of the tertiary educational system<lb/> contribute to such a pattern?<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. Source countries of internationally mobile students from non-EU countries, percentage change<lb/> 2002-2012<lb/></figure>

			<p>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation<lb/> 19.<lb/> Referring to credit or degree mobility 6 , literature provides some guidance, for instance<lb/> regarding those general factors affecting students&apos; decision for studying abroad at all, and then, also with<lb/> respect to their preferred destination country.<lb/></p>

			<head>5<lb/></head>

			<p>The group of internationally mobile students comprises &apos;international&apos; and &apos;foreign&apos; students. International<lb/> students are those students who crossed a border for studying in a specific destination country whilst their<lb/> usual domicile is abroad (resident concept). Foreign students are those students who do not hold the<lb/> citizenship of the respective country they are studying in (national concept). The first concept depicts<lb/> actual international student mobility in a precise way, but as some countries do only provide information<lb/> on foreign students, the second category cannot be neglected. Subsequent chapters will differentiate<lb/> between these two concepts whilst also commenting on the impact regarding outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>6<lb/></head>

			<p>Credit mobility refers to short-to medium-duration study spells abroad, typically one or two semesters,<lb/> whilst staying enrolled at a university in the country of origin. Acquired credits from abroad, for instance<lb/> ECTS in the European context, are then allowed for the domestic degree. In contrast to this, degree<lb/> mobility refers to those internationally mobile students who enrol for a complete programme abroad, hence<lb/> obtain their degree abroad. This type of mobility will be at the centre of this work.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Literature review on determinants of cross-border student mobility<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> Aside from mere intrinsic motives, e.g. acquiring additional human capital, externally set<lb/> incentives seem able to foster student mobility as well. Within their analysis of any impact of studying<lb/> abroad on graduates&apos; propensity to start their career abroad, Oosterbeek and Webbink (2009) along with<lb/> Parey and Waldinger (2011) demonstrated that grants to high-achieving students or the availability of<lb/> Erasmus funding schemes increase the likelihood of going abroad during studies significantly. Scrutinizing<lb/> the mobility of ERASMUS-participants, Rodríguez <ref type="biblio">González et al. (2011)</ref> focused on host country features<lb/> which possibly serve as pull-factors for intra-European student flows. Using a gravity model, they showed<lb/> that flows are positively affected by size of the host country and the share of the highly educated in the<lb/> country of origin. Quality of receiving institutions and the spoken language in the host country are also<lb/> relevant flow determinants 7 . Typically for findings in the migration context, distance between source and<lb/> destination country dampens flows, even in case of intra-European student mobility. Findings of Caruso<lb/> and de Wit (2013) supported the relevance of a host countries economic performance, regarding integration<lb/> and overall performance, in the context of intra-European student flows. Beyond that, educational spending<lb/> and higher levels of safety are positively associated with a host country&apos;s attractiveness.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Following a human capital approach, Perkins and Neumayer (2013) analysed degree mobility<lb/> for a large set of source and destination countries, whilst accounting for distinct socio-political and<lb/> economic features. They also supported findings of <ref type="biblio">Findlay et al. (2012)</ref> who stressed acquisition of social<lb/> and cultural capital to be one of the driving forces behind the decision to study abroad. At the same time<lb/> both author groups acknowledged that cross-border student mobility should not be seen as an isolated<lb/> event, but a decision in light of individual career plans. Perkins and Neumayer (2013) presented evidence<lb/> that enrolment abroad is positively influenced by the income level in the host country -an indication for<lb/> better labour market perspectives in a host country and thus possibly increasing benefits of studying<lb/> abroad. Additionally, network effects have been identified, implying that costs of mobility could be<lb/> mitigated by the presence of fellow nationals which could provide information and support. Sharing a<lb/> language, which facilitates studying and daily life likewise, seems to affect the decision to study abroad<lb/> positively as well. Distance, implying higher travel costs, and larger income gaps between sending and<lb/> receiving countries impose both non-negligible impeding factors in a monetary sense. Both effects are<lb/> larger in the case of least developed countries, compared to newly industrialised countries 8 . Institutional<lb/> quality matters primarily for international students from newly industrialised economies whereas higher<lb/> income levels increase host countries attractiveness to a larger extent for students originating from least<lb/> developed countries.<lb/> 22.<lb/> The relative importance of higher educational sector&apos;s features is also emphasised by Van<lb/> Bouwel and Veugelers (2010) in an analysis of 18 European countries: a larger student base, better ranking<lb/> positions of universities 9 , tuition fees 10 and especially higher funding per student boost the numbers of<lb/> incoming students. Using data on 13 OECD countries, <ref type="biblio">Beine et al. (2014)</ref> confirmed the afore-mentioned<lb/> major results concerning quality and tuition fee, whilst highlighting the signalling effect of tuition fees.<lb/> They also identified a positive network effect, pointing to the relevance of past migration streams. Once<lb/> again, geographical and linguistic proximity have been shown to influence flows positively.<lb/> 7<lb/> i.e. if the spoken official language in the destination country is English, French, German, Italian or Spanish<lb/> , inward flows are higher<lb/> 8<lb/></p>

			<p>Both groupings follow the World Bank&apos;s classification in 2010.<lb/></p>

			<head>9<lb/></head>

			<p>This may also reflect ranking according to the number of foreign students enrolled.<lb/></p>

			<head>10<lb/></head>

			<p>Although perhaps counterintuitive at first glance, tuition fees could be perceived as a sign of quality of a<lb/> host country&apos;s universities, thus attracting more students.<lb/> 23.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Thissen and Ederveen (2006)</ref> focused more on labour market aspects in their evaluation of<lb/> possible determinants of enrolment of foreign students in EEA-countries: they concluded that higher<lb/> income levels and lower unemployment rates substantially foster inflows of foreign students.<lb/> 24.<lb/> This short literature review provides some important information on main determinants of<lb/> cross-border student flows: institutional quality, distance, and economic conditions matter. If a host<lb/> country&apos;s tertiary educational system is perceived to be of high quality, more international students chose<lb/> this country as a destination. Geographically closer host countries or those with higher degrees of<lb/> proximity in a cultural or linguistic sense are favoured too. In addition, internationally mobile students<lb/> seem to be influenced by economic perspectives in a potential host country, accordingly to their individual<lb/> career plans. Studying abroad is not merely an &apos;adventure&apos;, but a deliberate choice right from the start.<lb/> 25.<lb/> To provide an empirical examination of international students&apos; location choices, the following<lb/> chapter will present the distribution of international and foreign students within the EU Higher Education<lb/> Area. A special focus rests on source countries, as well on degree types and fields of study.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Source and destination countries<lb/></head>

			<p>26.<lb/> Chapter 2.2 is dedicated to a detailed examination of the distribution of international students<lb/> within destination countries in the European Union, in terms of main countries and regions of origin. Such<lb/> an approach allows illustrating a host country&apos;s attractiveness for students from a specific geographical<lb/> area as well as from a political or economic entity. The results are of a descriptive nature, displaying four<lb/> types of cross-border student mobility:<lb/>  intra-European mobility<lb/>  students from EFTA countries<lb/>  inbound mobility from OECD countries (net EU countries)<lb/>  mobility of students from other countries (equal to worldwide net EU, EFTA and OECD countries,<lb/> subsequently also referred to as &apos;third countries&apos; or &apos;other countries&apos;)<lb/></p>

The first part<lb/> presents absolute enrolment figures of internationally mobile students to assess the relative attractiveness<lb/> of destination countries based on raw numbers. Absorptive capacity of a host country&apos;s tertiary educational<lb/> system is accounted for in the second part, by adjusting these numbers by the size of the respective HE<lb/> system. For each EU host country the value from 2012, if available, and a five year change rate of the<lb/> corresponding indicator will be reported.<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation<lb/> A first impression regarding the attractiveness of the EU Higher Education Area can be obtained from<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Though Chinese students are the largest group of international students in the EU in absolute<lb/> numbers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), their overall preference for studying in the EU is relatively small: only 23 percent<lb/> of all Chinese students studying abroad came to the EU in 2012. In case of another newly industrialising<lb/> country, i.e. Brazil, students favour the EU clearly – 58 percent chose an EU member state as destination<lb/> for their studies abroad.<lb/></p>

			<p>28.<lb/> Europe offers a large selection of possible destination countries, all providing a rich variety of<lb/> structured programmes in tertiary education. Though the Bologna process contributed substantially to a<lb/> harmonization of tertiary education, there still remain distinct features of each potential destination<lb/> country: the spoken language in daily life, the main language used in courses at HE institutions, cultural<lb/> peculiarities and economic conditions.<lb/> 29.<lb/> As highlighted in the literature review, these distinct features can be expected to affect the<lb/> choices of international students regarding the preferred host country during their studies. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents<lb/> an overview for 2012 of absolute figures for internationally mobile students enrolled in the current 28<lb/> member states of the European Union, by source regions.<lb/> 30.<lb/> Unsurprisingly, the largest number of incoming students (426875) was in 2012 enrolled at a<lb/> university in the UK. France and Germany attracted the second (256261) and third highest number<lb/> (191734) of international students. This picture corresponds to a large extent to the size of a destination<lb/> countries&apos; tertiary educational sector. Other leading destinations were Italy, Austria, Spain and the<lb/> Netherlands which attracted in 2012 between 55000 and 77000 internationally mobile students. With a<lb/> total number of 39128 enrolled international students, the Czech Republic was the leading destination<lb/> country in Central-Eastern Europe in 2012.<lb/></p>

			<p>+ no precise information with respect to students&apos; country of origin available, only rough geographical region is known (Africa,<lb/> Asia, Caribbean and Central America, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania)<lb/> 31.<lb/> The ranking of countries is different when enrolment of EU students is compared with that of<lb/> non-EU students. More than two thirds of internationally mobile students originate from another EU<lb/> country in the case of Slovakia, Luxemburg, Austria, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. In 12<lb/> member states, no more than one out of three international students originates from another EU-country -<lb/>this includes the five most populated EU countries. Intra-European student mobility is thus more important<lb/> in smaller countries.<lb/> 32.<lb/> Students from third countries (other countries of origin, not members of EU, EFTA or OECD)<lb/> constitute the largest share in Lithuania. However, this is due to its direct neighbour Belarus, which<lb/> accounts for almost 40 percent of enrolled students from third countries. The highest absolute numbers of<lb/> inbound students from other countries are hosted in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and<lb/> Spain. Seemingly, most populated countries respectively larger economies attracted most students from<lb/> third countries. Within this group of five countries, France has with 73.4 percent the largest share of third<lb/> country students, and Germany with 44.2 percent the lowest.<lb/> 33.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table A. 1 (in the appendix) shows the Top Five of source countries for each EU member state,<lb/> excluding other EU or EFTA countries. In 11 out of 15 old (pre-2004) EU member states, Chinese students<lb/></table>

			<p>constitute the largest or second largest group of international students from outside the EU or EFTA. This<lb/> source country&apos;s relevance could be interpreted not only as reflecting the massive number of young<lb/> Chinese, but also as an outcome of the new global geographies: Since there occurs a shift of multi-national<lb/> corporations&apos; R&amp;D expenditures towards China as one new geographic focus (Bruche, 2009, p. 274), its<lb/> economy will naturally display an increasing demand for highly qualified employees in R&amp;D. And most<lb/> likely, a substantial fraction of this increased demand initially will be met by hiring employees having<lb/> received tertiary education abroad.<lb/> 34.<lb/> The Top Five also suggests the importance of geographical proximity and persistent<lb/> implications of historical or colonial ties. Geographical proximity facilitates travel and the exchange of<lb/> information. Furthermore, it implies often a certain degree of cultural similarity. All those factors might<lb/> affect the costs of mobility in an advantageous way, either by decreasing uncertainty or by reducing<lb/> monetary costs of student mobility. The impact of historical or former colonial ties appears not to be<lb/> restricted to students, but is also found for immigration towards OECD or EU countries in general (see e.g.,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">DeWaard et al., 2012; Ortega, 2009</ref>) and appears to be increasing for certain countries 12 (<ref type="biblio">Hooghe et al.,<lb/> 2008</ref>).<lb/> 35.<lb/> Historical or colonial ties could exert an effect on today&apos;s students&apos; choices in a twofold way:<lb/> first, there are often well established institutional co-operations or programmes between HE institutions or<lb/> an ongoing thought exchange on a governmental or administrative level. These links can contribute to<lb/> lowering uncertainty about what to expect abroad. This can be observed for the Eastern European countries<lb/> having joined the EU in the 2004 enlargement: predominant other source countries are Russia or other<lb/> former members of the onetime Eastern Bloc -even more than two decades after it ceased to exist. Second,<lb/> colonial ties often imply a shared language, as for all of the Portuguese Top Five source countries. A<lb/> common language in turn eases daily life and facilitates the learning process at university (<ref type="biblio">Perkins and<lb/> Neumayer, 2013</ref>).<lb/> 36.<lb/> Bringing these descriptive findings together highlights that population&apos;s composition of third<lb/> country students in EU countries is partially history-dependent, and partially the result of an increasing<lb/> economic and demographic weight of emerging economies.<lb/> 37.<lb/> Within a global market for higher education, the EU is the most important destination region:<lb/> EU countries which were also OECD members attracted almost 31 percent of foreign students worldwide<lb/> in 2011, followed by North America where 21 percent of all foreign students are enrolled in tertiary<lb/> education (OECD, 2013, p. 306). Within the EU, especially the United Kingdom strongly increased its<lb/> market share concerning tertiary education for foreign students within one decade. During the same period,<lb/> the global number of students enrolled outside their country of citizenship increased from 2.1 million in<lb/></p>

			<table>2000 to 4.3 million in 2011 (OECD, 2013, p. 306).<lb/> 38.<lb/> This dramatic rise in the number of internationally mobile students can be observed in almost<lb/> every single EU member state: since 2007, only Ireland and Croatia recorded a decline in the overall<lb/> number of international students. The increase is to a large extent caused by rising intra-European mobility,<lb/> but is bolstered by rising numbers of students from third countries.<lb/> 39.<lb/> As Table 2 reveals, most EU countries 13 hosted higher number of internationally mobile<lb/> students in 2012 than they did five years earlier. Amongst those countries, 13 recorded an even higher<lb/> increase for third country student mobility compared with intra-European student mobility. Belgium, Spain<lb/> and Lithuania have seen the number of internationally mobile students from third countries triple in five<lb/> years.<lb/> 40.<lb/> In contrast to this development, Germany was the only major host country to experience a<lb/> decline -of almost 12 percent -in students from non-OECD/EU/EFTA countries, although this may be a<lb/> statistical artefact. 14<lb/> 13<lb/> At the reference period 2007, two of those 28 countries have acceded to the European Union in this exact<lb/> year (Bulgaria and Romania), and Croatia was not yet a member state.<lb/> 14<lb/> the number of enrolled international students without clear information on country of origin rose to 17,000,<lb/> possibly explaining this decline.<lb/> Table 2.

			<head>2.2.2 Inbound ratios – international student mobility from a relative point of view<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> Does the growing number of international students lead to a change in the composition of the<lb/> total student body or does it merely reflect the expansion of the tertiary educational system? To answer<lb/> this, the relative size of international student mobility compared to total enrolment in tertiary education in a<lb/> respective host country is examined.<lb/> 43.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table A. 2, as well as Figures 7 and 8, present the inbound ratios for the years 2007 and the<lb/> most recent years for the 28 EU member states. This ratio is calculated for each of the source and host<lb/> countries as<lb/> í µí°¼í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ =<lb/> í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> (eq. 1)<lb/></table>

			<p>45.<lb/> The majority of countries experienced a growing share of third country students. A number of<lb/> countries have, however, seen declines: Austria, Ireland and Portugal, principally. In the case of Austria,<lb/> the decrease is primarily attributable to a considerable drop of the enrolment of students from China as<lb/> well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. For Ireland and Portugal, the disadvantageous economic developments in<lb/> the analysed time horizon serve as likely explanations.<lb/> 46.<lb/> How successful was the European Union overall with respect to attracting international<lb/> students? In relation to enrolment of domestic students a distinct answer can be given: Overall, the<lb/> European Union saw an increase in the weighted 15 inbound ratio of third country students from 2.9 to 3.8<lb/> percent (EU students: 1.9 to 2.4 percent). The average increase in third country student inbound ratio in the<lb/> EU 28 is not driven by the rising enrolment of international students in the UK, but by a rather evenly<lb/> spread increase in internationalisation across the EU. Excluding the UK from the average still yields an<lb/> increase of 0.7 percentage points (instead of 0.9 percentage points) on the aggregate level.<lb/></p>

			<head>15<lb/></head>

			<p>The weighting procedure accounts for substantial differences in the size of the tertiary educational sectors<lb/> of the examined countries. Each country-level inbound rate was weighted by the number of students<lb/> enrolled in this specific county, í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡ . Germany and Luxembourg are not included as no corresponding<lb/> figures for 2007 are available.<lb/> 47.<lb/> Whilst an analysis of absolute numbers for all internationally mobile students previously<lb/> (chapter 2.2.1) portrayed an unbalanced development, the overall trend relative to the size of their tertiary<lb/> educational system is once again similar across countries, as indicated by <ref type="figure">Figure 8.<lb/></ref> 48.<lb/> The inbound rate for all internationally mobile students in the EU rose from 2007 to 2012 by<lb/> 1.5 percentage points on average. Consequently, international students represent a larger share of the<lb/> tertiary educational system within the European Union. Such findings give rise to the hypothesis that the<lb/> absorptive capacity of HE institutions evolves in a comparable manner across EU member states.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Inbound ratios for all internationally mobile students, 2007 and 2012<lb/> Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations<lb/> Note:<lb/> *<lb/> most recent values from 2011<lb/> ** most recent values from 2010<lb/> 49.<lb/> Aside from Luxembourg (figures from 2010) with by far smallest tertiary educational system in<lb/> the EU, Austria and Cyprus have the highest inbound rates referring to intra-EU mobility (see <ref type="table">Table A</ref>. 2<lb/> in the appendix). In the first case, a substantial number of German students, studying at universities in the<lb/> neighbouring country in the South-East, inflates this value; in the latter case, the result is mainly driven by<lb/> Greek students. Among large EU countries, only the United Kingdom has such a high share of EU students<lb/> enrolled at its tertiary institutions. In 2012, the share of European students in total enrolment in France,<lb/> Germany, Italy and Spain was lower than in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Denmark.<lb/> 50.<lb/> When third country students are considered, the picture changes: France experiences large<lb/> inflows from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, pushing it into the Top three of destination countries. The fifth<lb/> and sixth highest inbound ratios, referring to third country students, can be found for Finland and Sweden.<lb/> Though these two countries rank relatively low as a destination for European students, they successfully<lb/> attract students from third countries. For most Eastern European countries, in contrast, the shares of<lb/> students from other countries are almost negligible.<lb/> 51.<lb/> From an aerial perspective, looking at the European Union as a whole, the share of international<lb/> students enrolled increases. Universities across the EU become more diverse with respect to students&apos;<lb/> origins. This increase is in line with one of the major goals of Council Directive 2004/114/EC, namely<lb/> &quot; <ref type="biblio">[p]</ref>romoting the mobility of third-country nationals to the Community for the purpose of studies &quot;<lb/> (European Commission, 2004, p. 1).<lb/> 52.<lb/> Whilst previously described patterns provide credible evidence that the European Union is an<lb/> increasingly attractive place for temporary studies it yet has to be determined whether the EU is also<lb/> attractive to international graduates in a short-, medium-or long-run.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Gender distributions of international students<lb/></head>

			<p>53.<lb/> Studying abroad is not only an important aspect from an educational point of view, enlarging<lb/> the intellectual horizon and strengthening human capital. It offers also the opportunity for academic<lb/> exchange, and to participation in cultural or daily life of the destination country. Yet, there might be an<lb/> alternative aspect of participation which could provide valuable insights into the attractiveness of the EU<lb/> Higher Education Area, namely women&apos;s participation in international tertiary education. While the data<lb/> structure prevents conducting analyses on the source country level, it is possible to look at the time series<lb/> from 2002.<lb/> 54.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table A</ref>. 3 (in the appendix) contrasts inbound rates of male and female international students,<lb/> giving information on the gender-specific share of international students in relation to the respective<lb/> gender&apos;s enrolment numbers in a given country. For roughly 50 percent of the country-year observations<lb/> the ratios are balanced. For the majority of other cases, the female inbound ratio is at least 20 percent larger<lb/> or smaller than the corresponding male rate. Usually, the latter case prevails.<lb/> 55.<lb/> As the presented numbers are ratios, the gender difference is not to be interpreted at face value<lb/> since its causes cannot be unambiguously determined. Gender differences within countries could emerge<lb/> either from gender differences between inbound numbers or differences between gender-specific enrolment<lb/> numbers, the latter primarily caused by domestic student enrolment. Hence, presented ratios for the three<lb/> observation points in time should be interpreted with caution in a within-country context.<lb/> 56.<lb/> Despite this limitation, the ratios provided can be used to evaluate between-country differences<lb/> with respect to attractiveness on international students of a given gender in a specific year. What can be<lb/> derived is that for instance Austria draws more female international students than Denmark in relation to<lb/> each countries female total enrolment numbers (15.3% vs. 7.3% in 2012). Countries with relatively fewer<lb/> women than men include Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.<lb/></p>

Observable female/male enrolment ratios<lb/> for internationally mobile students show that there might be some destination countries which are<lb/> persistently preferred by one sex, compared to the other. Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain display<lb/> at all three reference points a larger number of female international students.<lb/> 58.<lb/> The overall picture shows varying relative participation of female international students across<lb/> countries. But why are there substantial differences in internationally mobile students&apos; preferences between<lb/> the two sexes?<lb/> 59.<lb/> Two main mechanisms could be driving this outcome: First, one should remember that host<lb/> countries display a heterogeneous composition of their international student body with regard to students&apos;<lb/> origins – some have a larger share of students from other EU member states, others a higher share from<lb/> other continents (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Aside from general socio-cultural differences between countries<lb/> of origin and destination countries, distance could matter as well.<lb/></p>

			<head>16<lb/></head>

			<p>The underlying data source provides only aggregate figures and an inbound rate for female<lb/> students, thus absolute figures for male and female enrolment of internationally mobile students<lb/> have to be &apos;recovered&apos;.<lb/> 60.<lb/> Keeping the possibly mobility-deterring effect of distance in mind, there is evidence that<lb/> willingness to migrate is associated to individual risk attitudes: less risk-averse individuals are more<lb/> willing to migrate (<ref type="biblio">Jaeger et al., 2010; Nowotny, 2010</ref>). At the same time, women tend to be more risk-<lb/>averse in general than men (<ref type="biblio">Dohmen et al., 2011</ref>), or even when several definitions of risk domains are<lb/> separately investigated (see e.g., <ref type="biblio">Charness and Gneezy, 2012; Nicholson et al., 2005</ref>). There is even some<lb/> evidence of a relationship between risk attitude and migration patterns on the level of short-to medium<lb/> distance migration, when it comes to students&apos; choice of a study location (Weisser, 2015b). 17<lb/> 61.<lb/> In addition, gender-specific returns to education abroad might be influential as well: if studying<lb/> abroad was associated with a certain risk and women&apos;s marginal returns to the acquisition of<lb/> transnationally applicable human capital were lower, they would benefit less from studying abroad at more<lb/> remote destinations than their male fellow students. Consequently, if a host country was particularly<lb/> attractive to students from a specific remote country of origin, e.g. due to historically established<lb/> connections, it might be that only the most risk-seeking students with highest expected returns would<lb/> embark on the journey of studying several years abroad. This could explain higher inbound numbers of<lb/> male students in some countries.<lb/> 62.<lb/> A second driving force of gender imbalances regarding numbers of inbound students could<lb/> reflect the portfolio of study programmes and access criteria in the tertiary educational system itself. If a<lb/> country had an especially strong focus on engineering sciences, it would plausibly attract a larger share of<lb/> those international students who are interested in such programmes. Gender differences concerning<lb/> enrolment preferences are known from domestic students and could apply to international students as well.<lb/> For example, Charles and Bradley (2009) examined students&apos; enrolment choices in 44 developing,<lb/> transitional or industrialised countries and show that women are underrepresented in the field of<lb/> engineering in all countries and overrepresented in the field of humanities and social sciences. Barone<lb/> (2011) concentrated on eight European countries and points to distinct gender differences in graduation<lb/> numbers on a finer grid of 14 different fields of study. He, too, identified gender-related preference<lb/> disparities which are also remarkably stable over time. Thus, regardless of the economic development of<lb/> source or destination countries, there remain substantial differences in gender-specific tastes.<lb/> 63.<lb/> Plausibly, this will also come into play when it comes to enrolment at a European university,<lb/> and accordingly, gender-specific inbound rates will be affected.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Internationally mobile students by field of study<lb/></head>

			<p>64.<lb/> As the choice of a specific destination country or a receiving institution will be heavily<lb/> influenced by the programmes and curricula offered, international students preferences for various fields of<lb/> studies will be examined in this paragraph. Overall, there is credible evidence that some sorting of students<lb/> into specific host countries occurs according to their tastes for a given field. At the same time, the<lb/> distribution of preferences implies that internationally mobile students do not display a higher preference<lb/> for the STEM fields in general.<lb/></p>

			<p>65.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> demonstrates that internationally mobile students 18 , coming to EU countries, have a<lb/> high preference for social sciences, business or law programmes. In almost every EU country, where data<lb/> 18<lb/></p>

			<p>The students&apos; type indicates whether the underlying data refers to international or foreign students.<lb/> on internationally mobile students is available, international students are concentrated in those<lb/> programmes. 19<lb/> 66.<lb/> There is also a large fraction of internationally mobile students who chose Belgium, Hungary,<lb/> Latvia, Poland or Romania in order to enrol in the field of health or welfare. Engineering, manufacturing or<lb/> construction programmes draw internationally mobile students to Denmark, Finland, Germany and<lb/> Sweden.<lb/> 67.<lb/> The fields of education, services, as well as agriculture or veterinary science are the least<lb/> chosen from the perspective of internationally mobile students. Within the four most preferred fields of<lb/> internationally mobile students, the dominating choices are humanities, business and administration,<lb/> computing and engineering respectively.<lb/> 68.<lb/> Overall, there is credible evidence that some sorting of students into specific host countries<lb/> occurs according to their tastes for a given field. At the same time, the distribution of preferences implies<lb/> that internationally mobile students do not display a higher preference for the STEM fields in general.<lb/></p>

			<p>69.<lb/> Further insights can be obtained from disaggregating the international student body by level of<lb/> study. As the underlying goal of this work is an examination of factors which induce internationally mobile<lb/> students from other countries to stay in Europe after graduation, special attention will be paid to post-<lb/>graduate studies (ISCED 6).<lb/> 70.<lb/> There are two reasons to focus on post-graduate education. First, if someone obtained a first or<lb/> second stage degree (Bachelor or Master, ISCED 5) within the EU Higher Education Area and choses then<lb/> to stay for doctoral studies (ISCED 6), this can be seen as an indication of attachment to the host country<lb/> and willingness to prolong the stay in general.<lb/> 71.<lb/> Furthermore, there is some evidence that PhD students are more inclined to stay in the host<lb/> country than bachelor or master students after graduation (OECD, 2014). And, even if some international<lb/> post-graduate students earned their first degree outside the EU, they would still contribute during their<lb/> post-graduate studies to a host country&apos;s research output.<lb/> 72.<lb/> The average ratio of post-graduate (ISCED 6) internationally mobile students to internationally<lb/> mobile students enrolled in a first-stage (ISCED 5) programme is 0.093 20 in 2012 for the EU 28 (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>).<lb/> In the United Kingdom, for example, there is one international post-graduate student enrolled for ten first-<lb/>stage international students.<lb/> 73.<lb/> In agriculture and veterinary science, although total enrolment numbers are low, there is a<lb/> substantial share of international students coming to a European country for their doctoral education.<lb/> Similarly, in the fields of science, mathematics and computing as well as engineering, manufacturing and<lb/> construction, international PhD students have a more pronounced preference for studying in the EU than<lb/> international bachelor and master students do.<lb/></p>

			<head>19<lb/></head>

			<p>Cyprus is the most obvious outlier. Here, almost 73 percent of international students are enrolled in the<lb/> field of social science, business and administration.<lb/></p>

			<head>20<lb/></head>

			<p>Each countries ratio is weighted by the total number of enrolled international students in this respective<lb/> country.<lb/></p>

			<p>cs cell size of respective ISCED 5 reference group below five<lb/> 74.<lb/> The descriptive statistics presented in this chapter point to the fact that the profile of<lb/> international students in the EU higher education area is rather heterogeneous. Aside from an overall trend<lb/> of rising numbers of international students enrolled in an EU country, there are important distinctions by<lb/> students&apos; origin, sex, designated study fields, and level of study. Concerning the ability to attract high-<lb/>skilled individuals, and possibly to keep them, the ratio of international second-stage to international first-<lb/>stage tertiary enrolment (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>) indicates that some countries seem to have a relatively more pronounced<lb/> appeal than others. An alternative explanation might be that second-stage higher education institutions in<lb/> these countries specifically target international candidates.<lb/></p>

			<head>3 POST-GRADUATION STAY RATES IN THE LITERATURE<lb/></head>

			<p>75.<lb/> Attracting international students during the course of their studies is one possible way<lb/> immigration can contribute to a knowledge economy. But how could the EU benefit from these talents<lb/> after graduation?<lb/> 76.<lb/> Keeping a share of those graduates in Europe – the larger, the better – would contribute to this<lb/> goal. Having examined the distribution of internationally mobile students within the European Union, the<lb/> pool of potential stayers, the focus shall be shifted to the main part of this paper, namely understanding and<lb/> empirically examining staying behaviour of international graduates.<lb/> 77.<lb/> The literature identifies several issues regarding the quantitative assessment of such staying<lb/> behaviour: Precise identification of international students on a cross-country level is the first challenge. A<lb/> second complication is the fact that internationally mobile individuals are often hard to track – if they<lb/> graduate from university, they can easily disappear from the &apos;administrative radar&apos; and in many cases it is<lb/> virtually impossible to follow them, and therefore to calculate reliable stay rates.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Furthermore, staying behaviour is a dynamic phenomenon: although some international<lb/> graduates decide to stay immediately after graduation in the host country, they may change their minds in a<lb/> subsequent period – perhaps due to worsening economic conditions in the host country -and go back to<lb/> their country of origin or a third country. Others may have planned right from enrolment to study and then<lb/> gain initial work experience in a foreign country before returning after some years. Consequently, a<lb/> cohort&apos;s stay rate immediately after graduation will almost surely decline as time passes. This stresses the<lb/> importance of establishing stay rates&apos; reference periods.<lb/> 79.<lb/> The following literature review 21 delivers a status quo picture, but also shines a light on<lb/> potential pitfalls with respect to the chosen calculation method. These findings serve as foundation for an<lb/> assessment of the feasibility and error-proneness of various proposed calculation methods in the extended<lb/> version of this paper; only the main implications and results will be presented in chapter 4 of this paper.<lb/> 80.<lb/> There are two main branches in the literature on staying patterns of internationally mobile<lb/> students, respective academics in general. One is dedicated to the examination of stay (or return) rates<lb/> where the underlying implicit research question is who stays or returns after having graduated abroad?<lb/> Here, students displaying degree-mobility are in the centre of interest and it is possible to derive stay rates<lb/> in or return rates from a given host country, since information on host and source country is available.<lb/> 81.<lb/> The second branch, which does not directly address stay or return rates, is guided by the slightly<lb/> different question who chooses to start a career abroad after having spent some time during studies<lb/> abroad? In this line of research, the usual observation unit are students exhibiting credit-mobility and it is<lb/> only known that they started their career either &apos;somewhere&apos; outside their home country or they have<lb/> returned from &apos;somewhere&apos;. Since there are many similarities between conceptual approaches and<lb/> discussed determinants, the second branch offers valuable insights with respect to locational choices of<lb/> graduates.<lb/> 82.<lb/> In order to generate insights into observable staying behaviour, which is the prerequisite for any<lb/> evaluation of stay or return rates, staying or returning intentions are left out. Publications covered in this<lb/> 21<lb/></p>

			<p>This literature review is not exhaustive, but includes the most prominent publications from 2002 onwards,<lb/> dedicated to stay or return rates of international or foreign academics, comprising students, graduates or<lb/> researchers.<lb/> literature review represent authors&apos; most recent version of a paper discussing truly observable stay or<lb/> return decisions on an empirical basis. 22<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Credit mobility and the likelihood of starting a career abroad<lb/></head>

			<p>83.<lb/> Typically, research on the effects of studying abroad concentrates primarily on the<lb/> improvement of language proficiency, intercultural skills or a change of individual attitudes or valuations.<lb/> If authors try to establish a connection between working abroad and previous experiences as internationally<lb/> mobile student, the data does not allow a comparison with a suitable reference group, i.e. non-mobile<lb/> graduates (<ref type="biblio">Bracht et al., 2006; Norris and Gillespie, 2009</ref>). This in turn makes it virtually impossible to<lb/> infer a reliable effect of studying abroad.<lb/> 84.<lb/> The overall focus on soft skills, network and intercultural aspects also applies in the context of<lb/> the few specifically designed long-term studies where authors used a suitable control group (<ref type="biblio">Hansel, 2008;<lb/> Paige et al., 2010</ref>). Actual labour market outcomes, and thus any possible dependency from earlier<lb/> experiences abroad, are for the most part ignored. Instead, possible interconnections between credit<lb/> mobility on the one hand and self-assessed &apos;employability&apos;, a vaguely specified &apos;international dimension&apos;<lb/> in the job or &apos;intentions to work abroad&apos; on the other hand are examined.<lb/> 85.<lb/> Limiting the review to quantitative studies of actually observable or retrospectively reported<lb/> episodes of employment abroad excludes a vast amount of small or medium scale survey publications,<lb/> relying mainly on descriptive presentations.<lb/></p>

			<figure>86.<lb/> Despite this restriction, a coherent picture arises in the investigated literature (see overview in<lb/> the extended version of this paper): When non-mobile students are used as a reference group, studying<lb/> abroad exerts an effect with respect to the chosen location of graduates&apos; labour market entry.<lb/> 87.<lb/> For a short-to medium-term perspective (one to seven years after graduation), Parey and<lb/> Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro (2012) reported – whilst accounting for potential endogeneity of the<lb/> decision to study abroad – that Erasmus participation increases likelihood of starting the working career<lb/> abroad by 12 to 24 percentage points. Wiers-Jenssen (2008) presented smaller values, between 2 and 4<lb/> percentage points, which come close to the OLS-benchmark values of the first two publications.<lb/> Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011) provided evidence that studying abroad also affects high achieving<lb/> students, with a stay abroad lowering the likelihood of starting working life in the country of origin by 30<lb/> percentage points.<lb/></figure>

			<p>88.<lb/> Enlarging the time horizon to two decades after graduation, Voin and Gérard (2013) as well as<lb/> King and Ruiz-Gelices (2003) calculated probability differentials for those who studied abroad, finding<lb/> that the share of those who ever worked abroad after graduation was between 9 and 17 percentage points<lb/> larger within this group of formerly mobile students.<lb/> 89.<lb/> Overall, the limited literature on the relationship between international study experience and<lb/> labour market entry location yields credible evidence for a positive and robust effect of student mobility on<lb/> the likelihood of starting a career as an expatriate. Studying at least one semester abroad raises the<lb/> likelihood of working after graduation in another country substantially, although the effect&apos;s magnitude<lb/> 22<lb/></p>

			<p>Only the latest versions are cited, unless methodology and data source have changed.<lb/> may vary considerably between fields of study, type of mobility programme, and applied evaluation<lb/> method 23 .<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 Degree mobility and stay rates for specific countries<lb/></head>

			<p>90.<lb/> The type of cross-border mobility examined in this paragraph is mainly degree-mobility, since<lb/> only this type of mobility can provide answers to the question &apos;How large is the share of internationally<lb/> mobile students who stay in the host country after graduation?&apos;<lb/> 91.<lb/> All but one of the 41 publications covered are from the periods 2002-2014, hence the same<lb/> timeframe that is also covered by this work&apos;s empirical part. The extended version of this paper comprises<lb/> detailed tables with a comprehensive overview over the main findings from the literature review.<lb/> 92.<lb/> While all included publications address the phenomenon of international students&apos; post-<lb/>graduation mobility behaviour in one way or another, the procedures and data sources chosen varied<lb/> widely. Furthermore, derived results vary depending on the precise group under scrutiny, observed field of<lb/> study, combination of host and source country, time horizon, reference point in time etc.<lb/> 93.<lb/> The first conclusion to be drawn is that no unique stay rate for international students exists for a<lb/> given country, but rather a multitude of stay rates. This reflects not primarily imprecise calculation<lb/> methods or small sample sizes, but great variance in the angle of observation. As a special case for<lb/> example, Ruiz (2014) ascertained even different stay rates related to varying levels of aggregation for the<lb/> US: whilst one third stayed after graduation in the US, 15 percentage points of foreign students lingered<lb/> even in the same metropolitan area.<lb/> 94.<lb/> Nonetheless, some central tendencies and common patterns can be derived for some types of<lb/> bilateral stay rates or reference groups.<lb/> 95.<lb/> A substantial number of authors (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Achato et al., 2011; Bratsberg, 1995; Guo, 2010;<lb/> Merwood, 2007; OECD, 2011; Wilkinson et al., 2010</ref>) calculated stay rates based on permit status changes<lb/> of former students: the number of status changers over international (foreign) graduates or students. This<lb/> gives an idea how many international students have been granted (temporary) residence. Those studies<lb/> relied on large sample sizes, but overall results are sensitive to administrative and legislative changes over<lb/> time. Consequently, the figures presented should be interpreted as stay rates for individuals who were<lb/> allowed to stay instead of those who chose to stay.<lb/> 96.<lb/> Short-term stay rates are much higher than medium-term stay rates (<ref type="biblio">Finn, 2012</ref>; Ministeriet for<lb/> Forskning, Innovation og Videregående Uddannelser, 2013; <ref type="biblio">Nemeckova and Krylova, 2014; Suter and<lb/> Jandl, 2006</ref>), reflecting a non-negligible subsequent emigration wave of initial stayers. The declining<lb/> numbers of stayers stabilise in a longer perspective. Nevertheless, the dynamic aspect of a staying decision,<lb/> which can be revised even years after graduation, is rarely accounted for directly. Only studies relying on a<lb/> survey, or those tracking career histories (<ref type="biblio">CIDA, 2005; Sage et al., 2013; Tian, 2013</ref>), provide information<lb/> regarding repeated migration events in the context of international students&apos; mobility. Unfortunately, they<lb/> suffer from small or very small sample size, most times below 500 subject-specific observations (e.g.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Badikyan, 2011; Bond et al., 2006; Lehr, 2008; Silver, 2012</ref>).<lb/> 97.<lb/> In general, medium-to long-run stay rates of doctoral students and researchers tend to be higher<lb/> than those of undergraduate students (<ref type="biblio">Gaule, 2011; van Bouwel and Veugelers, 2012</ref>; van de Sande et al.,<lb/> 23<lb/> Estimated coefficients of Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011), Parey and Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro<lb/> (2012) are larger in absolute magnitude since they are local average treatment effects.<lb/> 2005</figure>

			<p>). This may be linked to a different focus at the time of the decisions to go abroad, although it may<lb/> also reflect greater returns to postgraduate degrees, or favourable policy settings for those with advanced<lb/> degrees.<lb/> 98.<lb/> Students from countries with weaker economic conditions tend to display higher stay rates in<lb/> economically more developed countries than their peers from other economically developed countries<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hein and Plesch, 2008; Vasiljev, 2014</ref>). Chinese and Indian international students are usually amongst<lb/> those with highest stay rates (<ref type="biblio">Achato et al., 2011; Wang, 2012; Zang and Li, 2002</ref>).<lb/> 99.<lb/> International students or researchers in a scholarship programme mostly leave the respective<lb/> host countries after graduation (<ref type="biblio">Hein and Plesch, 2008; Lehr, 2008; van de Sande et al., 2005</ref>). This is<lb/> related to specific features of the scholarships, i.e. requiring students to leave after graduation. A second<lb/> explanation is that such grants can be a component of a development aid programme in fields relatively<lb/> more valued in source countries, for instance agriculture.<lb/> 100.<lb/> With respect to field of study, stay rates of international students enrolled in natural sciences or<lb/> in a technical field tend to be higher than for those enrolled in social sciences and humanities. Retention<lb/> rates are especially higher in the field of life sciences (<ref type="biblio">Finn, 2012; Kim et al., 2011; Wolfeil, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 101.<lb/> Amongst those studies who reported gender-specific stay rates, results point to a more<lb/> pronounced staying behaviour of female international students. Where there was a substantial difference<lb/> between stay rates of the two sexes, male students are typically more prone to leave the host country after<lb/> they graduated (<ref type="biblio">Bijwaard, 2010; Vasiljeva, 2014</ref>).<lb/> 102.<lb/> Focusing on the EU, literature provides even more scarce guidance: only for approximately one<lb/> third of the current 28 EU members stay rates could be found. Once again, stay rates vary between bilateral<lb/> pairs of host and source countries (or regions), and across applied methodologies (<ref type="biblio">Felbermayr and<lb/> Reczkowski, 2012</ref> presented for the EU a kind of upper limit of 71%). The highest rates can be observed<lb/> for the UK, Germany, France, Denmark and the Netherlands -also five of the countries with highest per<lb/> capita income. Aside from the Netherlands and Denmark, they also have the largest tertiary educational<lb/> sectors. Also noteworthy is that stay rates based on permit data seem to be smaller than figures based on<lb/> survey or administrative micro-data. This might be attributable to the fact that implemented surveys<lb/> typically addressed a specific sub-sample of internationally mobile students, e.g. alumni of a university or<lb/> participants in a scholarship programme. In these cases special effort is exerted to track members of the<lb/> designated target group. Yet, if stayers had a higher response rate than returnees, as they first group might<lb/> be easier to track, results would be skewed towards higher stay rates.<lb/> 103.<lb/> In the end, a non-conclusive picture emerges from the literature. There is an urgent need to<lb/> develop a more coherent approach to evaluate stay rates of internationally mobile students. To conduct<lb/> reliable between-country or between-group analyses, a robust methodological framework, underpinned by<lb/> comparable and reliable data, is required.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 Determinants of post-graduation staying behaviour<lb/></head>

			<p>104.<lb/> Having sketched some potential determinants of international students&apos; initial locational choices<lb/> in chapter 2, the extent to which those factors also contribute to international graduates&apos; staying decision<lb/> shall now be explored.<lb/> 105.<lb/> Some host country characteristics, e.g. a specific language or cultural similarities, might affect<lb/> international students and graduates all alike. Other destination country features, such as labour market<lb/> conditions around graduation time or work permit regulations might have a more severe impact on the<lb/> decisions of graduates as they are immediately concerned.<lb/> 106.<lb/> In the literature on international student stay rates a number of publications assess determinants<lb/> of international students&apos; staying behaviour from a quantitative point of view. This subchapter summarises<lb/> already identified determinants or promising candidates and evaluates their magnitude, as indicated in the<lb/> literature.<lb/> 107.<lb/> As one of the first authors, Bratsberg (1995) investigated possible determinants of students&apos;<lb/> long-run stay rates in the US for a set of 69 countries of origin in an econometrical framework. Within his<lb/> analysis special attention was paid to general economic and labour market differences between destination<lb/> and source countries. He presented evidence that earnings variations in both countries played a significant<lb/> role in explaining students staying behaviour. If earnings increased in the US by one standard deviation,<lb/> the average stay rate rose by 3.2 percentage points. Similarly, a one standard deviation decrease in the<lb/> source countries&apos; labour income raised the long-term stay rate by 8.2 percentage points. Furthermore,<lb/> higher degrees of income inequality or higher returns to education in the country of origin were associated<lb/> with lower stay rates. Interpreting higher earnings variation as an indication of a relatively higher valuation<lb/> of specific skills, this result points to the special importance of skills&apos; valuation in the home country – if<lb/> engineers were comparably poorly rewarded in the country of origin, international engineering graduates<lb/> would prefer to stay in the respective host country. If the source country&apos;s GDP was to double, observed<lb/> stay rate would decline on average by 5.5 percentage points. <ref type="biblio">Bratsberg (1995)</ref> extended his empirical<lb/> analysis also to non-economic aspects: increasing geographical distance coincided with a higher stay rate 24 ,<lb/> so did stronger immigration ties between source and destination country.<lb/> 108.<lb/> In its evaluation of the Canadian Francophone Scholarship Program (CFSP), part of Canadian<lb/> development assistance, CIDA (2005) pointed to factors which made some former scholarship holders stay<lb/> in Canada. Amongst this group, the opportunity to bring one&apos;s family to Canada right from the start was<lb/> mentioned as fostering staying behaviour. The desire to gather working experience in an industrialised<lb/> country, specific job offers in Canada, respectively the lack of attractive job opportunities in the home<lb/> countries were also major concerns of those who stayed. The general socio-political and academic culture<lb/> in the host country, as well as non-deterring immigration regulations were referred to by survey<lb/> participants as relevant reasons for staying.<lb/> 109.<lb/> In a discussion of brain circulation, Rosenzweig (2006) evaluated factors affecting the<lb/> depreciation rate of foreign student stocks in the US 25 . He derived that if the skill price in the source<lb/> country doubles, the stay rate decreased by 32 to 41 percent. Foreign students from Asian countries were in<lb/> general less likely to stay in the US after they completed their study programme, but they were also found<lb/> to react more sensitively to changes in skill prices.<lb/></p>

			<figure>110.<lb/> Within their analysis of locational and work place choice of Dutch graduates, Venhorst et al.<lb/> (2010) examined possible determinants of staying in peripheral regions of the Netherlands. They indicated<lb/> that students born outside of Europe were in general much more likely to leave these regions for work<lb/> abroad than to stay. This effect was even more pronounced for students from other European countries.<lb/> 24<lb/> If the distance between the home country&apos;s capital and the closest US gateway increased by 1000 miles, the<lb/> stay rate increased by 3.4 percentage points. The distance was likely to capture monetary and psychological<lb/> migration costs, thus staying would be a strategy to avoid the costs of re-migration to the country of origin.<lb/> 25<lb/> Rosenzweig (2006) calculated a stock depreciation rate, using asan unadjusted numerator students with an<lb/> F-1 visa who adjusted their status within a seven month period in 2003, rather than twelve months. In the<lb/> model specification, GDP in the source country is excluded &quot; as financing cost should not be a<lb/> significant factor for the decision to return &quot; . Rosenzwieg&apos;s model of returning behaviour includes<lb/> university ranking variables. In a subsequent version Rosenzweig (2008) accounts for average GDP growth<lb/> but not the possible impact of overall wealth of a source country.<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, regions near a border successfully maintained high ability students from other countries, as they<lb/> were more inclined to stay than to start a career abroad.<lb/> 111.<lb/> Conducting an analysis of life cycle migration to the Netherlands, Bijwaard (2010) applied<lb/> several mover-stayer duration models which identified factors that influence the probability of becoming a<lb/> stayer for several groups of migrants, including students. For students, he showed that the longer students<lb/> stayed in the Netherlands, the less likely they were to leave. If students were older than 25 years when they<lb/> arrived, they were also less likely to stay, but this effect diminished with increasing age. Accounting for re-<lb/>migration events, after having left the Netherlands, the author derived long-run probabilities for residing in<lb/> the Netherlands. Based on estimates, generated within the mover-stayer duration framework, he presented<lb/> distinct results in comparison to a student reference migrant 26 : married or female international students 27<lb/> had a higher propensity to stay in the long-run in the Netherlands. This held true to an even larger extent<lb/> for students from other European countries (non-EU members), Turkey, China or Africa. Students from<lb/> English-speaking countries of origin, such as the UK, the USA or Canada, displayed either a similar or<lb/> lower probability of staying as the reference student does. Students from new EU-members and Germany,<lb/> in contrast, had a higher likelihood of staying – in the first cases economic differentials might matter, in the<lb/> latter case geographical or cultural proximity could serve as possible explanations.<lb/> 112.<lb/> In a follow-up study Bijwaard and Wang (2013) shifted their analytical focus fully to<lb/> international students and investigated the relevance of labour market and family formation dynamics after<lb/> graduation too. Using a &apos;timing-of-events&apos; approach they estimated the impact of employment or<lb/> unemployment spells as well as of marriage on the hazard of leaving the Netherlands after graduation. The<lb/> social factor &apos;marriage&apos; reduced for sub-groups the hazard of returning, thus implies a prolonged stay in the<lb/> Netherlands. Aside from the special group of students from Surinam or the Antilles, finding employment<lb/> affected this hazard in the same way, but the impact was less pronounced. Unemployment spells affected<lb/> students from different regions or origin in varying ways: students from EU-15 and EFTA countries, less<lb/> developed countries and the afore-mentioned former colonies tended to return as reaction to individual<lb/> unemployment. The opposite holds true for students from other developed countries.<lb/> 113.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Hein and Plesch (2008)</ref> used administrative data from a large Catholic scholarship-providing<lb/> institution to evaluate determinants of return for scholarship holders from developing or transitioning<lb/> countries who studied in Germany. Personal factors, such as age, having children or closer ties to the home<lb/> country were found to be negatively related to the likelihood of staying. Network effects tended to increase<lb/> only men&apos;s propensity to stay. Language proximity between the home country language and German<lb/> predicted staying behaviour in a pronounced manner, as did the time spent in Germany. Women were also<lb/> more likely to stay in general, and they reacted more sensitively to both factors. <ref type="biblio">Hein and Plesch (2008)<lb/></ref> provided also some insights regarding the impact of economic and political factors: poor labour market<lb/> conditions in the destination country or rising living standards in the country of origin made international<lb/> students return, and the former seems to especially affect women&apos;s decisions. Greater economic or political<lb/> freedom, and better living conditions for women in the home country, lowered the likelihood of staying<lb/> after graduation. Regarding the source regions, students from Asia were less inclined to stay in Germany<lb/> after graduation whilst historical ties operated in the opposite way for African students.<lb/></p>

			<head>26<lb/></head>

			<p>The student reference migrant is defined as unmarried 21 year old male student originating from an EU15<lb/> or EFTA country, not including Germany, the UK and France. His long-run staying probability is 21<lb/> percent.<lb/> 114.<lb/> Scrutinising returning decisions of scientists who joined a US chemistry department during<lb/> graduate studies or post-doctoral career, Gaule (2011) estimated a discrete-time model of the hazard of<lb/> return. He derived that those who came during their graduate studies were only one third as likely to return<lb/> as those who came as faculty. Recognising the potential impact of a selective stay or return decision he<lb/> controlled for researchers&apos; ability too: academic scientist within the highest category of productivity,<lb/> measured as number of publications weighted by publishing journals&apos; impact factors, were approximately<lb/> twice as likely to stay in the US. Beyond individual factors he also evaluated the possible influence of<lb/> source countries&apos; characteristics on the staying behaviour. He found that if GDP per capita in a country of<lb/> origin was to increase by USD 1,000, the odds of return were to increase by 20 percent. Considering a<lb/> home country&apos;s scientific strength in the field of chemistry, measured as relevant publications in relation to<lb/> its population, any significant impact on the staying decision disappeared when controlling for country&apos;s<lb/> wealth.<lb/> 115.<lb/> Drawing from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), <ref type="biblio">Kim et al. (2011)</ref> examined<lb/> determinants of staying behaviour for three cohorts (1980s, 1990s and 2000s) of foreign post-graduate<lb/> students in the US in a large sample. The impact of age diminished in later cohorts whilst female graduates<lb/> were persistently more inclined towards staying. His findings supported also the claim that students&apos;<lb/> attachment to a host country – as measured by continuing directly with post-graduate studies -is a non-<lb/>negligible factor: those who came to the US for their undergraduate studies were twice as likely to stay<lb/> after their PhD-Studies. Compared to the staying behaviour of the Canadian reference group, Chinese,<lb/> Indian and Korean students were always much more likely to stay. Though Europeans and students from<lb/> Africa displayed a higher likelihood too, they were less likely to stay than their peers from the three Asian<lb/> countries. Cohort-specific patterns varied also by field of study: whilst earlier cohorts in any fields, aside<lb/> from agriculture, were much more likely to stay than the reference group of biology-graduates, this pattern<lb/> was reversed for the 2000s cohort, suggesting that conditions for biologists in the USA must have<lb/> improved relative to those for graduates in other fields. <ref type="biblio">Kim et al. (2011)</ref> also showed that staying<lb/> behaviour is partially influenced by financial aspects: being funded as research or teaching assistant during<lb/> the doctoral studies increased the likelihood of staying afterwards substantially compared to being self-<lb/>reliant. On the other hand, receiving a fellowship and employer or foreign government financial support<lb/> lowered the staying probability significantly.<lb/> 116.<lb/> Van <ref type="biblio">Bouwel (2010)</ref> provided some descriptive evidence of factors affecting the locational<lb/> choice of Europeans regarding the first job after graduation from doctoral studies in the US and a later<lb/> career stage. The author explained that staying is more frequently chosen in later cohorts. Like <ref type="biblio">Kim et al.<lb/> (2011)</ref>, she also highlighted the relevance of the funding source: those who chose to stay were less likely to<lb/> be funded by an institution in the country of origin. Furthermore, stayers were much less likely to focus on<lb/> a research topic related to Europe in their dissertation, but more likely to be involved in an US-specific<lb/> topic. It can be concluded that providing funding and supporting host country-specific research topics<lb/> might foster graduates attachment to a host country.<lb/> 117.<lb/> In a follow-up study, Van Bouwel and Veugelers (2012) investigated determinants of staying<lb/> decisions of European doctoral students in the US incorporating scientific output measures. In addition to<lb/> confirming the basic previous findings, they found a strong positive effect of funding by the host institution<lb/> on the likelihood of staying after graduation. Additionally, being in a highly productive or supportive<lb/> research environment, indicated by existence or impact of early publications, encouraged European<lb/> graduates to stay. Conditioning on institutional quality or reputation, high-ability graduates chose high-<lb/>quality institutions for their first job in general, preferably in the host country, but also in the source<lb/> country over institutions with lower reputation. In this context, linguistic or cultural similarity seemed to<lb/> affect staying behaviour once again, since graduates from English-speaking countries were much more<lb/> likely to stay, irrespective of institutional reputation.<lb/> 118.<lb/> The entrenchment of doctoral students with their country of study was also highlighted by<lb/> OECD (2014). International PhD graduates were found to be significantly more likely to remain in Norway<lb/> after graduation, as were those who started a family. A further interesting finding was that having worked<lb/> during studies in a field related to the field of post-graduation employment increased the likelihood of<lb/> staying. Such job opportunities during studies might have served as entrance ticket to the labour market,<lb/> e.g. either by granting more direct access to job networks or by providing more country and occupation<lb/> specific human capital.<lb/> 119.<lb/> Reconstructing the careers of Chinese scientists in the field of mathematics, physics, chemistry<lb/> and biology, Tian (2013) investigated possible determinants of return for those with a foreign doctoral<lb/> degree from an English-speaking country. Based on a sample of 159 foreign degree holders (the small size<lb/> is due to the biographical identification procedure of scientists&apos; career history), the only highly significant<lb/> determinant of return is the quality of the respective institution at which someone earned her or his<lb/> doctorate. Compared to the reference group of higher education institutions in the lower six deciles of the<lb/> Academic Ranking of World Universities (&apos;Shanghai Ranking&apos;), those with degree from the top decile<lb/> were six times as likely to stay abroad, those from third to fourth decile still four times as likely to choose a<lb/> career path abroad. This is an indication that institutional quality, e.g. research strength and reputation,<lb/> may affect job market success and thus staying decisions of international graduates who chose an academic<lb/> or research track.<lb/> 120.<lb/> Using a unique combination of data from population, employment and educational institution<lb/> registers, Vasiljeva (2014) evaluated determinants of EU and EEA post-graduate students&apos; decision to stay<lb/> at least four years in Denmark after the 2004 EU enlargement. She concluded that the smaller the nominal<lb/> wage gap between source and host country, the more inclined students were to stay in Denmark in the<lb/> medium-run. Students from Southern or Western Europe were also more likely to stay than those from<lb/> Scandinavian countries. Unemployment and social security differentials between the country of origin and<lb/> Denmark did not play a significant role in explaining students&apos; staying decisions. Accounting for cultural<lb/> dimensions, students from countries with a higher acceptance for masculinity dominance 28 displayed a<lb/> higher preference for staying in Denmark. At the same time, male students from countries with higher<lb/> acceptance for power inequality were found to be less inclined towards staying – most likely as they<lb/> perceive that there might be more opportunities for them in their country of origin. In contrast to other<lb/> authors&apos; findings, <ref type="biblio">Vasiljeva (2014)</ref> showed inequality in the home country to be positively related to<lb/> staying probabilities whilst linguistic similarity exhibited no explanatory power at all 29 .<lb/> 121.<lb/> Some common findings can be derived from this literature review. The most obvious is that the<lb/> majority evolved around a discussion of staying behaviour in the US, a very large English-speaking<lb/> economy with a tertiary education sector attracting many international students. Most European countries<lb/> have very different labour markets from the US, even ignoring the language factor. Regarding staying<lb/> patterns of international graduates in the EU, literature provides only determinants for the Netherlands,<lb/> Norway or Denmark.<lb/> 122.<lb/> Nevertheless, there are a number of common determinants of international graduate stay rates.<lb/> Women tend to be more inclined towards staying in the chosen country of destination. Forming social ties,<lb/> e.g. marriage, fosters the willingness to stay – so does a longer time spent in the host country. Both factors<lb/> contribute to a higher attachment to the destination country. The latter leads to a larger degree of<lb/> familiarisation with a country&apos;s cultural peculiarities, contributing also to the formation of country-specific<lb/> human capital, which in turn facilities labour market entry in a host country.<lb/> 123.<lb/> International graduates base their decisions whether to stay or to return also on perceived<lb/> chances: if they assume job opportunities, i.e. skill-specific wages to be relatively higher in the home<lb/> country, or if the wealth differential between source and host country is not in favour of the host country,<lb/> they tend to return. But if they expect to run into social or political impediments, lowering their perceived<lb/> opportunities in a country of origin, they show a preference for staying.<lb/> 124.<lb/> Regarding the staying behaviour of doctoral students and scientists, especially the attractiveness<lb/> of the research environment and the funding source during their post-graduate studies is pivotal: the better<lb/> and stimulating working conditions were the less willing are those individuals to lose such benefits by<lb/> turning their back on the destination country.<lb/> 125.<lb/> Thus, the central conclusion to be drawn is that international graduates do not decide lightly<lb/> where they start their career after graduation. Instead, they stay if they consider a destination to be a<lb/> country of social and economic opportunities, as other types of migrants do as well.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 WHAT MAKES INTERNATIONAL GRADUATES STAY IN THE EU: INVESTIGATING<lb/> DETERMINANTS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS&apos; POST-GRADUATION RESIDENCE<lb/> CHOICES<lb/></head>

			<p>126.<lb/> This chapter is dedicated to empirically investigating the staying behaviour of international<lb/> graduates in the EU member states. The chosen econometric approach aims at providing some answers to<lb/> the question what determines international students&apos; stay rates in EU countries? Above insights into<lb/> possible mechanisms and determinants are addressed in an empirical framework, using permit based stay<lb/> rates. Although there are some drawbacks 30 , they offer also a huge advantage compared to the tested<lb/> alternatives: a substantial sample size of bilateral stay rates in 2012, ranging from 783 to 2107<lb/> observations.<lb/> 127.<lb/> A brief discussion of these statistics&apos; features and related issues will be given in chapter 4.1.<lb/> Chapter 4.2 lays the foundation for later econometric analysis by highlighting likely mechanisms and<lb/> introducing components which potentially exert an effect on stay rates. The econometric estimation<lb/> method will be presented in chapter 4.3. In chapter 4.4 results from the preferred model specifications will<lb/> be presented and their sensitivity to underlying modelling assumption will be evaluated.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 About the nature of internationally mobile students&apos; stay rates in the EU<lb/></head>

			<p>128.<lb/> Internationally mobile students are not an easy subject to study in a cross-country setup. First,<lb/> as a highly mobile group they are hard to track: Across countries, or even within countries, they are not<lb/> always registered in a comprehensive manner. In particular after graduation, during the transition from<lb/> university to working life, they easily disappear from the records.<lb/> 129.<lb/> A second issue is the existence of various definitions or recording procedures in different<lb/> countries. Some compile information on internationally mobile students using the resident concept others<lb/> rely on the national concept. Additionally, the data may vary regarding the level of aggregation: some<lb/> countries report only aggregate figures for all incoming students whilst others itemise them by country of<lb/> origin. Most of the data on internationally mobile students in the EU is stock data which cannot be linked<lb/> to any individual characteristics. This drawback can be partially remedied by evaluating staying behaviour<lb/> of individuals included in the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS); yet, this too comes at a price.<lb/> 130.<lb/> For the purpose of a cross-country assessment of staying behaviour of internationally mobile<lb/> students in the EU the previously mentioned hitches impose substantial analytical challenges. There is no<lb/> single perfect statistic identifying post-graduation mobility patterns in this group over all 28 EU member<lb/> states in a truly comparable and perfectly reliable manner. Instead, the statistic of choice depends on the<lb/> specific angle of a research question. For instance, the required statistic in an econometric analysis of<lb/> origin-specific stay rates for all member states should display different features then the statistic used to<lb/> evaluate labour market outcomes of internationally mobile students, respectively graduates.<lb/> 131.<lb/> As integral part of this research, several alternative statistics have been derived and compared in<lb/> an exploratory study part, found in the extended version of this paper (Weisser, 2015a). Detailed<lb/> information regarding their construction is provided there and the resulting statistics are contrasted in light<lb/> of their advantages and limitations. The following subchapter only provides a brief overview of stay rates<lb/> used for subsequent econometric analysis.<lb/></p>

			<figure>30<lb/> Methodological issues are discussed at length in the extended version of this paper.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.1.1 Construction of stay rates<lb/></head>

			<table>132.<lb/> The three relevant permit based stay rates are: í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°´,µí°´, í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 , and í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ .While all of them<lb/> identify those who stayed using permit status changes (from education to another permit category), each<lb/> was constructed using a different denominator. Stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°´derivesµí°´derives the population of internationally<lb/> mobile graduates as the total number of those who relinquish education-related permit status. This<lb/> population proxy, however, has to be recovered from a demographic equality, based on changes in stock<lb/> data and new permits since the required figure is not in the data. Several drawbacks are associated: permits<lb/> for education reasons are not exclusively issued for those enrolled in tertiary education, and for available<lb/> data the demographic equality does not always allow recovering plausible population proxies for all<lb/> countries and periods. The latter problem can be circumvented using past inflows, recorded as newly<lb/> issued education permits in a previous period, to generate a proxy for the population in the denominator<lb/> and match the respective cohort to present status changers (the stayers). Several time horizons have been<lb/> evaluated, accordingly to usual durations of a study programme. Most meaningful was a time horizon of<lb/> three years 31 , yielding stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 . To account for varying time horizons of study spells (between<lb/> one and four years) a mixed cohort approach integrated over cumulative inflows of these periods to recover<lb/> a proxy for the denominator, resulting in stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ .. In addition, all three categories of stay rates<lb/> were calculated as three year averages over the years 2010 to 2012 32 in order to counteract any random<lb/> fluctuations, and to attenuate the impact of minor changes in data recording.<lb/></table>

			<head>4.1.2 Post-graduation stay rates in the EU<lb/></head>

			<p>133.<lb/> Depicted conditional stay rates (í µí±í µí±1í µí°´,<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>) highlight that staying behaviour of<lb/> internationally mobile students varies greatly, depending on their country of origin. For example by far the<lb/> highest stay rate on the aggregate EU-level is displayed by internationally mobile students from Armenia<lb/> (79.5%). A high tendency to stay in the</p>

			<figure>EU can also be observed for students from Northern and Western<lb/> Africa, some South-East Asian countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States. These patterns can<lb/> be seen as hints towards potential determinants of staying behaviour, such as economic development or<lb/> historical relations.<lb/> 31<lb/> corresponding to a three year bachelor programme<lb/> 32<lb/> For the United Kingdom stock data series only contained values from 2012, therefore it had frequently to<lb/> be excluded from stay rates&apos; analysis.<lb/> Figure 9. Conditional average EU stay rates from 2010-2012, by source country<lb/> Note:<lb/> EU refers to 2014 EU members, excluding the United Kingdom. Since these stay rates are based on permits (SR1A), only<lb/> figures for non-EU countries can be derived.<lb/></figure>

			<p>134.<lb/> Similarly, destination-specific stay rates across the EU suggest that the retention potential<lb/> differs significantly between host countries. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> compares the stay rates in specific EU member<lb/> states, grouping incoming students into three categories depending on their origin. Stay rates in larger<lb/> member states tend to be higher, yet some smaller destinations also manage to retain a relatively large<lb/> share amongst their specific pool of incoming students. At the same time, stay rates of internationally<lb/> mobile students from other developed countries (OECD net EU) are typically distinctly below those from<lb/> students originating from third countries (World, net EU, EFTA and OECD).<lb/></p>

			<figure>135.<lb/> On the aggregate EU-level, across calculation methods, 6.3 to 8.0 percent of incoming students<lb/> from other OECD countries stayed in the country they studied. Those from third countries were much more<lb/> likely to stay; corresponding rates are in the range of 20.5 to 23.1 percent.<lb/> Figure 10. Comparison of conditional stay rates for international students from various source regions<lb/> Source: Based on Eurostat permit data, own calculations<lb/> Note:<lb/> Conditional on the existence of the maximum number of available yearly observations in 2010-2012.<lb/> EU* refers to current EU members net the United Kingdom.<lb/> EU** refers to all current EU members including the United Kingdom.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.2 Explaining stay rates: explanatory components and data sources<lb/></head>

			<p>136.<lb/> As the previous section has demonstrated, observed bilateral stay rates are highly specific to the<lb/> examined country pairs, and to a certain extent to the calculation method. The chosen analytical strategy<lb/> thus accommodates these facts by focusing on country-related features and applying the econometric<lb/> estimation procedure to all three types of stay rates.<lb/> 137.<lb/> The basic idea is to evaluate the impact of various specific features of source country í µí± and<lb/> destination country í µí± on the respective bilateral stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± . Within the analysis of these aggregate<lb/> pairwise stay rates three different types of influential factors will be</p>

Time constant features of host country í µí± (í µí»¿ í µí± ) which affect students from all non-EU countries<lb/> during the time horizon in a similar manner, e.g. cultural or climatic aspects of the host country.<lb/> 2. Specific pairwise time-constant factors (í µí± í µí±í µí± ), e.g. sharing a common language or having historical<lb/> ties.<lb/> 3. Potentially time-varying factors (í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ ), such as economic conditions, social aspects or legal<lb/> frameworks, encompassing composite indicators: Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and<lb/> Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI).<lb/> 4.3 Estimating determinants: econometric methodology<lb/> 138.<lb/> All three types of bilateral stay rates introduced in chapter 4.1 (í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°´,µí°´, í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 , and í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡<lb/> 1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ )<lb/></figure>

			<p>have been incorporated into two different modelling approaches. The first one, based on Papke and<lb/> Wooldridge (1996) can be applied if one assumes that zero stay rates and positive stay rates originate from<lb/> a common process, and the analytical focus rests on the stay rates&apos; conditional mean. However, if stay rates<lb/> are not the result of one single, but two sequential processes, a two-part estimation in the sense of <ref type="biblio">Ramalho<lb/> et al. (2011)</ref> might be appropriate. The first part is a binary zero-one response: either there are no stayers at<lb/> all or there is some positive number, yielding a non-zero stay rate. The second part consists of a fractional<lb/> response estimation for those cases with stay rates larger than zero 34 .<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4 Determinants of bilateral stay rates: empirical results<lb/></head>

			<p>139.<lb/> Since model selection procedures (see <ref type="table">Table A</ref>. 6 to <ref type="table">Table A</ref>. 11) indicated that all other link<lb/> functions are more frequently rejected than the complementary loglog link function, the subsequent part is<lb/> dedicated to the discussion of the one-and two-part specifications applying this specific type of link<lb/> function.<lb/> 140.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the outcomes for the most preferred specification relying on the Global<lb/> Competitiveness Index. For all the three stay rates the respective results from the one-part and fractional<lb/> part of a two-part model are reported. The latter shows results for the subset of non-zero bilateral stay<lb/> rates, hence it accounts for the possibility that there might be in fact two distinct processes as discussed in<lb/> chapter 4.3.<lb/></p>

			<figure>141.<lb/> Due to the construction of stay rates as averages (typically 2010 to 2012), and for the sake of<lb/> model parsimoniousness, GDP per capita differences, unemployment and competitiveness differences<lb/> 33 Further discussion on these components is included in the extended version of this paper.<lb/> 34 Derivation of both models is explained in the extended version of this paper.<lb/></figure>

			<p>entered the model as three year averages as well 35 . The &apos;diaspora effect&apos; incorporates potential network<lb/> effects with the corresponding variable being the share of migrants 36 from country í µí± living in a destination<lb/> country í µí± over the total population. This share can be interpreted as proxy for the likelihood of meeting<lb/> someone from the same country of origin – hence as probability of benefitting from potential diaspora<lb/> network effects.<lb/> 142.<lb/> The implementation of differentials between destination country (DC) and country of origin<lb/> (OC) was a result of two arguments. First, the degree of precision increased substantially when destination<lb/> country controls have been introduced (see appendix). This was mainly due to an improved estimation for<lb/> observations at the lower bound of zero. An immediate consequence is that variables at the destination<lb/> country level display perfect colinearity with these country controls and thus cannot be used anymore in<lb/> the cross-section sample.<lb/> 143.<lb/> The second consideration refers to the underlying decision-making process of individuals. As<lb/> previously mentioned, perceived opportunities will most likely govern the process whether to stay or to<lb/> return on an individual level. If an international graduate arrives at the conclusion that her living standard<lb/> will probably be higher in the destination country, she would be more inclined towards staying. Such<lb/> comparisons can be accounted for on the aggregate level by using differences whilst perfect colinearity<lb/> poses no longer an issue.<lb/> 144.<lb/> Testing the model&apos;s specification by usage of a generalised goodness of functional form test<lb/> (GGOFF, <ref type="biblio">Ramalho et al., 2014</ref>), suitable to detect symmetric and asymmetric misspecification alike,<lb/> supported the complementary loglog specification clearly in favour of symmetric ones, i.e. logit or probit.<lb/> Parallel conducted RESET-tests yielded also results in favour of the complementary loglog fractional<lb/> modelling approach. Direct model comparisons of one-and two-part specifications, using a P-test<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Davidson and MacKinnon, 1981</ref>; results not reported), lead to varying preferences depending on the<lb/> dependent variable and set of explanatory variables. Overall results insinuate a weak preference for the<lb/> two-part specifications.<lb/> 145.<lb/> For all three different stay rates to be investigated, some common results can be derived from<lb/> the GCI specification: bilateral time-invariant factors play a predominant role. If destination and source<lb/> country share a common official language the stay rate is between 3.7 and 6.3 percentage points higher for<lb/> students from such a country of origin. The effect of colonial ties after 1945 is similarly pronounced but<lb/> less frequently significant. The impact of distance is also non-negligible. If the distance between capitals<lb/> was to increase by one percent beyond 1000 kilometres 37 observed stay rates decline on average by 0.61 to<lb/> 0.84 percentage points.<lb/> 35<lb/> Alternative specifications including lagged differences have been tested. These yielded neither substantial<lb/> changes in other variables estimated coefficients nor in additional robust insights into the dynamic<lb/> influence of GDP per capita or unemployment differentials.<lb/> 36<lb/> The stock of migrants is based on the OECD&apos;s DIOC database 2010 and has been restricted to those being<lb/> at least 35 years old. The restriction has been adopted to limit the likelihood that the derived share of<lb/> migrants includes also internationally mobile students whose numbers are actually an integral part of the<lb/> stay rate to be explained.<lb/> 37<lb/> Average marginal effects &apos;dy/ex&apos; have the interpretation of semi-elasticities. Since marginal effects are not<lb/> constant, but depending on the reference distance, reported results referring to a specific value deliver a<lb/> more precise picture. Alternative specifications accounted for non-linearities as well. The quadratic<lb/> distance showed up to be insignificant.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Note: Average marginal effects are reported. &apos;DC&gt;OC&apos; represents a dummy category, indicating that the variables&apos; value is distinctly<lb/> (significantly) larger in the destination country, and &apos;OC&gt;DC&apos; vice-versa. Both categories&apos; outcomes refer to the reference group of<lb/> those observations with no distinct difference between destination and source country. GDP per capita, unemployment rate and GCI<lb/> pillar score differences entered as three year averages. &apos;dx/dx&apos; gives the discrete change from the base level (no difference between<lb/> the two countries). &apos;dy/ex&apos; gives the change of the dependent variable as reaction to a one percent change of the respective<lb/> continuous variable x at the given reference point of x. Additional information in the lower segment originates from the estimation of<lb/> the underlying model with a complementary loglog link function.<lb/> 146.<lb/> Economic prospects in an isolated view seem not to matter much on this aggregate level of<lb/> analysis: Differentials in the average GDP per capita are insignificant in the full specification. They only<lb/> become significant in the expected way in a reduced model (<ref type="table">Table A</ref>			<figure>. 4 to Table A. 6)<lb/> 147.<lb/> In light of findings in the literature regarding the impact of unemployment on staying<lb/> behaviour, a negative relationship between higher unemployment rates in source countries and a lower stay<lb/> rate in a European destination country is not implausible. Bijward and Wang (2013) provided evidence that<lb/> some individuals opt to stay in the country with higher unemployment rates. On the other hand, Vasiljeva<lb/> (2014) identified in her analysis no significant effect of unemployment differentials.<lb/></figure>

			<p>148.<lb/> An alternative interpretation could be found in the basic concept of the Roy model (<ref type="biblio">Roy, 1951)</ref>,<lb/> applied in the context of return migration of foreign-born by <ref type="biblio">Borjas and Bratsberg (1996)</ref> 38 . Even where<lb/> the unemployment rate in the country of origin were relatively higher, it still may be beneficial to return for<lb/> ability-dependent for a specific subgroup. Some international graduates may face attractive employment<lb/> 38<lb/></p>

			<p>Measures of inequality (including GINI indexes), the income distribution or unemployment rates of tertiary<lb/> education are not included due to small sample size or insufficient observations.<lb/> perspectives in their country of origin even when the general unemployment rate is higher than in the<lb/> destination country, if for example they offered a scarce and highly valued skill portfolio (e.g. international<lb/> experience or specific technical knowledge not widely spread in the source country).Regarding aspects of<lb/> competitiveness, two remarkable facts emerge. First, international graduates seem to display a certain<lb/> preference for destination countries with more developed institutions: stay rates rise by 3.2 to 7.8<lb/> percentage points if the average score differential of the GCI&apos;s first pillar is at least one standard deviation<lb/> above the mean. Second, if a country of origin scores distinctly higher compared to a destination country in<lb/> the pillar &apos;innovations&apos;, observed stay rates decline by 4 to 8.5 percentage points. Staying behaviour would<lb/> thus respond to improved innovativeness and a focus on a technological pioneering role in the country of<lb/> study.<lb/> 149.<lb/> There is also an indication that stay rates for students from larger economies (market size) are<lb/> smaller. Possibly, they expect to have a larger variety of opportunities in their home economy. In a similar<lb/> fashion, distinctly higher scores in the infrastructure pillar of a country of origin are associated with lower<lb/> stay rates as well.<lb/> 150.<lb/> The following table presents average marginal effects obtained using the governance<lb/> specifications (WGI). The results are highly consistent with respect to time-constant bilateral components<lb/> and economic differentials, measured by GDP per capita and unemployment rate differences (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>			<figure>).<lb/> 151.<lb/> Furthermore, the diaspora effect seems to be robust across almost all specifications. If the share<lb/> of migrants from a specific country of origin increases from 0.1 to 0.101 percent 39 , observed stay rates tend<lb/> to be higher by 0.95 to 2.8 percentage points.<lb/> 152.<lb/> Average WGI score differentials have been constructed in accordance with the 90 percent<lb/> confidence intervals from Kaufmann et al. (2010) 40 . The aspect of &apos;government effectiveness&apos; bears across<lb/> all types of stay rates and model specifications significant explanatory power: if a destination country<lb/> scores on average always significantly above a country of origin, stay rates are between 4.8 and 8.7<lb/> percentage points higher; if the country of origin performs better in this regard, stay rates are typically 10<lb/> to 11.4 percent smaller. All six specifications thus point to the fact that international graduates have a<lb/> certain preference to settle in the country which has more effective government and better public services.<lb/> 153.<lb/> Similarly, if a source country scores on average better in the domain of &apos;voice and<lb/> accountability&apos;, the average staying likelihood decreases by 13.6 to 16.1 percentage points 41 .<lb/> 39<lb/> Respective shares have a mean of 0.04 percent and a maximum of 10 percent. The chosen reference value<lb/> of 0.1 percent was already in the highest decile.<lb/> 40<lb/> &apos;DC&gt;OC&apos; indicates that the average score difference for the years 2010 to 2012 was always positive whilst<lb/> the 90% confidence intervals of both countries&apos; scores were always non-overlapping. This implies that the<lb/> resulting difference is in fact significant. The reference category for the WGI differential indicator consists<lb/> of those observations which displayed in at least one year an insignificant score differential.

			<p>Note: Average marginal effects are reported. &apos;dx/dx&apos; gives the discrete change from the base level (no difference between the two<lb/> countries). &apos;dy/ex&apos; gives the change of the dependent variable as reaction to a one percent change of the respective continuous<lb/> variable x at the given reference point of x. Additional information in the lower segment originates from the estimation of the<lb/> underlying model with a complementary loglog link function. &apos;DC&gt;OC&apos; represents a dummy category, indicating that the variables&apos;<lb/> value is distinctly (significantly) larger in the destination country, and &apos;OC&gt;DC&apos; vice-versa. Both categories&apos; outcomes refer to the<lb/> reference group of those observations with no distinct difference between destination and source country. GDP per capita,<lb/> unemployment rate and GCI pillar score differences entered as three year averages.<lb/> 154.<lb/> For stay rates derived based on method 1B, the dimensions &apos;political stability and the absence<lb/> of violence&apos; as well as &apos;rule of law&apos; reveal significant correlations with the expected sign. Yet, some<lb/> marginal effects are larger in magnitude or become significant only in the two-part specification, for<lb/> instance derived average marginal effects for &apos;rule of law&apos;. This can be seen as an argument for the<lb/> existence of two distinct processes governing the likelihood of observing a positive stay rate at all and then<lb/> the relative size of stayers&apos; population.<lb/></p>

			<p>155.<lb/> Taken together, these findings suggest that participation opportunities in general, stability and<lb/> reliability may influence staying decision.<lb/> 156.<lb/> Both modelling approaches, the competitiveness and the governance specification, lead to<lb/> similar conclusions: Some persistent factors, e.g. historical links or linguistic similarities, are likely to<lb/> influence staying behaviour heavily. Time-dependent aspects, such as per capita income, referring to<lb/> wealth level differentials between destination and source country might only be partially relevant.<lb/> Economic differentials might tip the scales, but are not necessarily major determinants on an aggregate<lb/> level. Well educated and globally mobile international students are likely to find their niche in most<lb/> economies.<lb/> 157.<lb/> Furthermore, findings on the aggregate level suggest that staying decisions are indeed linked to<lb/> an assessment of individual opportunities. Those countries seen as more innovative are more attractive to<lb/> international graduates. Institutional quality and the quality of political processes are plausible<lb/> determinants of stay rates too. Just like other migrants, international students and graduates opt for a career<lb/> start in the respective country offering more opportunities whilst providing an institutional environment<lb/> suitable to sustain these prospects.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 CONSEQUENCES OF POST-GRADUATION STAYING BEHAVIOUR ON EUROPEAN<lb/> ECONOMIES<lb/></head>

			<p>158.<lb/> Post-graduation mobility decisions of international students, i.e. the choice where they start<lb/> their careers, clearly have important economic consequences. Aside from the mere question in which<lb/> country they enter the labour market, their successful integration is relevant too. If their integration into a<lb/> host country&apos;s labour force proves difficult, not only public acceptance of tertiary educated labour migrants<lb/> might suffer but the economy would incur a loss as well -through a waste of international graduate<lb/> stayers&apos; potential and skills.<lb/> 159.<lb/> Aside from labour market related consequences, staying behaviour of international graduates<lb/> has implications with respect to fiscal policy too. There might be plausible arguments linking the costs of<lb/> providing education to international students and their post-graduation migration patterns. Beyond this, the<lb/> ramifications of changing stay rates on other policy domains should be considered as well.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1 Labour market related consequences<lb/></head>

			<p>160.<lb/> The integration of international graduate stayers into the labour market will be evaluated based<lb/> on descriptive statistics, derived from the EU-LFS. Available data, for most of the presented statistics,<lb/> allows a distinction between EU and third country national stayers. This entails the opportunity to evaluate<lb/> the degree of substitutability between these two distinct types of stayers.<lb/> 161.<lb/> This empirical examination is followed by a brief discussion of possible consequences of a shift<lb/> in the tertiary educated labour supply, induced by an increasing stay rate of international students and<lb/> graduates.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.1 Labour market outcomes of stayers -LFS<lb/></head>

			<p>162.<lb/> Regarding labour market integration and outcomes of international student stayers 42 the EU-<lb/>LFS provides valuable insights. A direct comparison of stayers to their native peers (domestic graduate<lb/> stayers), which graduated in the same year, allows a more in-depth analysis of employment outcomes in<lb/> general but also with respect to sectorial differences or other distinguishing characteristics.<lb/> 163.<lb/> International graduates are just as successful regarding their labour market entrance as domestic<lb/> graduates: one year after graduation there is no significant difference between the employment status of<lb/> domestic graduate stayers and international graduate stayers 43 .<lb/> 164.<lb/> International graduate stayers (10.9%) do not face larger risks of being unemployed than their<lb/> domestic peers (11.6 %). However, one should bear in mind that these international stayers might be<lb/> positively selected, with skills in high demand, whilst international graduates who failed to find a job or<lb/> who saw dim employment prospects already left the country.<lb/> 165.<lb/> International graduate stayers have a higher likelihood of receiving part-time contracts. This<lb/> result is to a large extent driven by stayers from third countries, especially female graduates. There<lb/> emerges also a noticeable difference regarding income deciles: international stayers have a slightly lower<lb/> probability of reaching the two highest deciles and a higher probability of being in the lowest two deciles.<lb/> The observed differences are not however significant at conventional levels.<lb/></p>

			<head>42<lb/></head>

			<p>Stayers are identified following the concept SR3, illustrated shortly in chapter 4.1.<lb/></p>

			<head>43<lb/></head>

			<p>The large share of inactive individuals is for EU graduate stayers, and especially for domestic graduates,<lb/> mainly driven by those who are studying on or who are in further training after their first degree.<lb/></p>

			<p>166.<lb/> Accounting for job adequacy, indicated by occupational skill level, international graduates<lb/> display a significantly higher likelihood of being employed in an occupation which requires only medium<lb/> or low skills. Whereas only 1.9 % of domestic stayers find themselves in a low-skill occupation, the share<lb/> of third country graduate stayers is 11.8 %.<lb/> 167.<lb/> Conditioning on the field of their university degree, EU graduate stayers differ significantly<lb/> from their domestic counterparts too. They engaged significantly less likely in teacher training and<lb/> education science (as seen in the general enrolment preferences) or in the field of social sciences, business<lb/> and law. On the other hand, they graduated more often in the humanities, languages and arts.<lb/> 168.<lb/> The preferred locational choice of international graduate stayers deviates clearly from domestic<lb/> stayers&apos; preferences. Third country graduate stayers, and even more so EU graduate stayers, prefer densely<lb/> populated areas over intermediate or more rural ones.<lb/> 169.<lb/> Overall, international graduate stayers perform comparably well regarding the integration into a<lb/> country&apos;s labour force. But as this brief analysis indicates, graduate stayers preferences and national or<lb/> regional labour market needs do not necessarily coincide. International graduate stayers seem little inclined<lb/> to reside outside of metropolitan areas, nor do they currently show signs of more pronounced preferences<lb/> for a career in STEM fields (science, mathematics and computing or engineering, manufacturing and<lb/> construction) or the area of health and welfare.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2 On the nexus of stay rates and skilled labour supply shifts<lb/></head>

			<p>170.<lb/> The question regarding a likely impact of a supply shift of tertiary educated labour on labour<lb/> market outcomes for involved groups is an ample field of research in itself. This paragraph thus can neither<lb/> provide a comprehensive overview over the state of current research nor can it present detailed empirical<lb/> results. It serves merely to spotlight three relevant aspects in the nexus of international graduates&apos; staying<lb/> behaviour and labour market outcomes: permanence of supply shifts, the impact on wage levels and<lb/> employment, and the unemployment of younger cohorts of tertiary educated labour.<lb/> 171.<lb/> Every international graduate who decides to stay in the country of graduation (or the EU)<lb/> contributes to a marginal supply shift of tertiary educated labour. Abstracting from all other effects of such<lb/> a supply shift, there still remains the question concerning the aspect of permanence: is an international<lb/> graduate&apos;s decision to stay final or only part of a qualification process which increases human capital<lb/> further before returning?<lb/> 172.<lb/> Literature provides some direct information regarding staying behaviour of internationally<lb/> mobile graduates in a more dynamic context. For instance Finn (2012) reported for foreign PhD-holders in<lb/> the USA five year stay rates which declined by eight percentage points on average compared to short-term<lb/> rates. This decrease holds also for graduates in computer sciences and engineering, and it is even more<lb/> pronounced for physical science and mathematics.<lb/> 173.<lb/> Similarly, figures presented by Van Bouwel (2010) pointed to a decrease of five to eight<lb/> percentage points, depending on the source region of European PhD-holders graduating in the USA. For<lb/> Denmark, Ministeriet for Forskning (2013) showed stay rates of international students three years after<lb/> graduation to be six percentage points lower than after the first year.<lb/> 174.<lb/> Unsurprisingly, staying behaviour of internationally mobile students might only be temporary.<lb/> Whilst some came initially to stay for good, others aimed at gathering some working experience and<lb/> collect then the additional skill premium in a different labour market. As the previous chapter indicated,<lb/> short-run stayers are likely to be positively selected, this might also hold true for sequential staying<lb/> decisions in the medium-or long-run.<lb/> 175.<lb/> Nevertheless, the cohort of those who chose to stay at first will shrink over time, even in the so-<lb/>called STEM-fields which are typically mentioned in the context of alleged skill-shortages. If international<lb/> graduates are sought to alleviate the impact of this kind of stated friction, it has to be kept in mind that only<lb/> a fraction will be there to fulfil this role in the long-run. They are highly-skilled and have already proven to<lb/> be highly mobile as well, so in the end, some of them will only be temporary migrants and not permanently<lb/> provide their talent to the EU.<lb/> 176.<lb/> Turning to the second aspect, namely the connection between changing staying patterns and<lb/> wages, one could try to infer whether status quo and recent wage trends might be conducive to a desired<lb/> expansion of tertiary educated labour supply. Although purely monetary motives are not necessarily<lb/> pivotal regarding staying decisions of international graduates, comparably higher wages at career start after<lb/> graduation might nevertheless increase someone&apos;s inclination towards staying. On an aggregate level, this<lb/> could then result in a broadening of tertiary educated labour supply.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 11. Changes of average hourly real wages for high-skilled young professional<lb/> Source: Structure of earnings survey and HICP (Eurostat), own calculations<lb/> Note:<lb/> *<lb/> the category&apos;s complete label is &apos;Education; human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and<lb/> recreation; other service activities&apos;<lb/> EU** refers to all 28 current EU members Average real wage changes have been derived as change of average hourly<lb/> wages between 2002 and 2010 net consumer price changes, the latter taken from the HICP series (Harmonised Indices of<lb/> Consumer Prices). High-skilled workers are identified based on the ISCO-08 classification.<lb/> 177.<lb/> Figure 11 depicts the changes between 2002 and 2010 in hourly average real wages of high-<lb/>skilled employees for three different sectorial aggregates. The sample has been restricted to those below 30<lb/> years of age to represent the entry ages after university graduation.<lb/> 178.<lb/> In almost all EU member states which acceded in the 2004 enlargement, average real wages<lb/> surged. This can be attributed to a large extent to a catching-up process, since in 2010 the average hourly<lb/> wages are still clearly below the wages in the old EU member states.<lb/> 179.<lb/> Most of the older EU member states experienced moderate real wage increases for young<lb/> professionals. However, some of them welcomed high-skilled labour market entrants with decreasing real<lb/> wages, with the United Kingdom leading the way. Here, &quot; each cohort of graduates since the financial crisis<lb/> is earning less than the one before &quot; . &quot; New graduates who earned £15,000 or more in 2011-12 – enough to<lb/> start repaying their loans – were paid on average 12 per cent less in real terms than graduates at the same<lb/> stage of their careers in 2007-08 &quot; (Financial Times, 2013).<lb/> 180.<lb/> For the EU as a whole, the picture looks similar: across all high-skilled occupations, real wages<lb/> declined between 2002 and 2010 by 6.9 to 34.3 percent. This is not exclusively a result to the financial<lb/> crisis: between 2002 and 2006 young professionals employed in the field of &apos;Education; human health and<lb/> social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; other service activities&apos; benefitted from a real<lb/> average wage growth of 4.4 percent – while young high-skilled workers in the remaining eight groups<lb/> experienced a decline of average real wages of 1.5 to 17.4 percent.<lb/></figure>

			<p>181.<lb/> Real wage developments for young high-skilled professionals in the EU 15 raise doubt on the<lb/> existence of a general labour shortage concerning high-skilled employees. Beyond, partly declining<lb/> average real wages for this group will neither increase enrolment in tertiary education in general, nor<lb/> improve the EU&apos;s retention capability with respect to international graduates. Instead, this adverse<lb/> development suggests a relatively weaker demand for tertiary educated or high-skilled labour at an early<lb/> career stage in the EU in the period examined.<lb/> 182.<lb/> The third aspect to be briefly highlighted are employment perspectives for internationally<lb/> mobile graduates with respect to their risk of being unemployed. As previously shown, those who stayed<lb/> upon graduation have almost identical unemployment rates than their domestic peers. This suggests that<lb/> the sample of stayers is affected by a country&apos;s general labour market conditions in a similar manner as<lb/> nationals. These general conditions have worsened from 2008 onwards on a broad scale. In most of the EU<lb/> countries, tertiary educated (ISCED 5 and 6) individuals below age 40 faced in 2013 a much higher<lb/> likelihood of being unemployed than they did five years ago (see <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>).<lb/> 183.<lb/> This adverse labour market environment was especially harsh for the age cohorts 20 to 24 and<lb/> 25 to 29 years, which is the typical age at which someone graduates from university. The unemployment<lb/> rate of the youngest graduates reached 18.8 percent in 2013, for those aged 25 to 29 it was at 10.7 percent<lb/> still the highest value since this series has been introduced. This general trend is also mirrored in some<lb/> anecdotal evidence, highlighting that even a costly university education is no longer a guarantee for a<lb/> smooth labour market entry: the top 100 employers in the UK offered in 2014 nine percent fewer graduate<lb/> vacancies than before the crisis (<ref type="biblio">Financial Times, 2013</ref>).<lb/> 184.<lb/> Under the currently prevailing circumstances in most EU countries, higher stay rates or<lb/> especially higher absolute numbers of stayers would most likely not contribute to improving the labour<lb/> market situation for tertiary educated entrants. This is also true in light of the fact that stayers&apos; fields of<lb/> graduation are not significantly different from those of their domestic peers -hence they offer a similar<lb/> portfolio of qualification and skills. Taking recent years&apos; unemployment trends and the similarity of<lb/> international and domestic graduates into account, any first-glance impression of those two types of<lb/> graduates being substitutes cannot be easily dismissed. If international graduates are supposed to<lb/> strengthen the economic position of EU member states by providing their skills and talents, the general<lb/> environment which enables them to do so should be improved.<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: Eurostat, EU-LFS data<lb/> 185.<lb/> What are the general conclusion regarding the nexus of staying behaviour of international<lb/> graduates and skilled labour supply shifts? Current labour market conditions, thus unemployment rates and<lb/> remuneration trends, indicate relatively poor conditions for labour market entrants after graduation on the<lb/> aggregate EU level. With some exceptions, international graduates are now facing in most EU countries<lb/> less favourable labour market conditions than five to ten years ago. This in turn might translate into lower<lb/> stay rates in the short-or medium term as highly-skilled and internationally mobile graduates attribute a<lb/> dwindling attractiveness to the EU labour markets.<lb/> 186.<lb/> In addition, graduate stayers&apos; initial study preferences are similar to those of domestic students.<lb/> Hence it is rather unlikely that higher numbers of stayers translate immediately into substantially higher<lb/> numbers of qualified job applicants in STEM occupations, especially in non-metropolitan areas. The<lb/> underlying issue, a mismatch between applicants&apos; study or location preferences and employers&apos; demands,<lb/> cannot be eradicated by unselective retention of international graduates.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 General fiscal and demand-related implications of graduates&apos; staying behaviour<lb/></head>

			<p>187.<lb/> Labour market outcomes of international graduate stayers have shown that stayers display an<lb/> employment rate at least as high as the native comparison group. Such high shares regarding stayers&apos;<lb/> participation indicate that they constitute a relevant part of the highly skilled labour force.<lb/> 188.<lb/> If, furthermore, a host country has a high demand for tertiary educated labour, which cannot be<lb/> satisfied by domestic supply, international graduate stayers&apos; labour supply will be complementary. Hence,<lb/> any additional graduate stayer would marginally contribute to an expansion of the host country&apos;s output -<lb/>and as employee to an increasing income tax base alike.<lb/> 189.<lb/> Moreover, these stayers display an unemployment rate similar to domestic graduates or below,<lb/> hence they typically do not pose a burden to social security systems: amongst those graduates who one<lb/> year after graduation are unemployed or inactive, 5.4 percent of domestic graduates and 5.1 percent of all<lb/> international graduate stayers receive benefits or assistance. Restricting the sample to third country<lb/> nationals who stay, 97.1 percent of unemployed or inactive stayers do not receive any social benefits or<lb/> assistance whilst the same holds true for only 94.6 percent of domestic graduates. The design of social<lb/> security benefits or assistance, most likely eligibility criteria, and the high employment rate of international<lb/> stayers ensure that international stayers are from a relative point of view a lesser burden to EU social<lb/> systems than domestic graduates.<lb/> 190.<lb/> International graduate stayers who are unemployed or inactive do still consume in the chosen<lb/> country of residence, thus they contribute to the demand for commodity goods. This plausibly results in a<lb/> marginal contribution to the respective country&apos;s GDP. At the same time, by means of value added<lb/> commodity good and service taxation, they further contribute to municipal or governmental revenues.<lb/> 191.<lb/> If one extends the time horizon to comprise also periods prospective international graduates are<lb/> still enrolled at university, the consumption argument holds of course already during studies. <ref type="biblio">Vossensteyn<lb/> et al. (2013)</ref> quote for example a weekly consumption level of 500 Australian Dollar for international<lb/> students in Australia. They also report that international students in Canada spent in 2010 more than 7.7<lb/> billion Dollars for tuition fees, accommodation and discretionary spending. NAFSA (2013) provides<lb/> figures regarding the economic relevance of international students in the US: international students and<lb/> their dependents contributed in the academic year 2012/2013 approximately 24 billion US-$ to the US<lb/> economy and supported 313,000 jobs. For the UK, international students&apos; contribution to the economy is<lb/> assumed to be in the range of 12.5 billion British Pound. Over and above, &quot; for every ten international<lb/> students, three full time equivalent jobs are created in the UK &quot; (House of Commons, 2011, p. 8).<lb/> 192.<lb/> Taken these facts together, the average graduate stayer can be expected to become already in<lb/> the short-run not only a consumer, adding to internal demand, but also a fiscal net-contributor.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3 Funding of higher education and internationally mobile students<lb/></head>

			<p>193.<lb/> Before international stayers can contribute to a host country&apos;s economic prosperity after<lb/> graduation, they already constitute a part of the overall demand for tertiary education. For a couple of<lb/> countries, this fraction amounts to more than ten percent of total enrolment (see <ref type="table">Table A</ref>. 2). This has<lb/> further fiscal implications regarding the funding of higher education.<lb/> 194.<lb/> Some countries, for instance the UK, charge higher tuition fees from non-EU students. Others,<lb/> aside from administrative fees, provide access to higher education for all students free of tuition fees. The<lb/> first group of countries not only manages to recover marginal costs of providing tertiary education to a<lb/> third country student but also to lessen fiscal restrictions regarding the funding of higher education<lb/> institutions in general. In fact, this might even result in a successful sort of cross-subsidising tertiary<lb/> education for domestic students 44 by attracting international students (Findlay, 2011, p. 178). In the<lb/> absence of capacity constraints, any additional international student generates an immediate fiscal gain.<lb/> 195.<lb/> This outcome is partially efficient since those who benefit personally from a high quality<lb/> education system also shoulder associated costs. On the other hand it might be partially inefficient as well:<lb/> if international fee paying students decide to stay upon graduation, then the host country would benefit<lb/> from a privately funded human capital investment. This kind of positive externality might imply an<lb/> initially too low private investment in education, and the higher the stay rate, the larger the overall impact<lb/> of this externality might become.<lb/> 196.<lb/> For the second group of countries, the immediate net effect is not as unambiguous. Accounting<lb/> only for the purely fiscal aspect of funding tertiary education in a short-run, any additional international<lb/> student will lead to a marginal increase of public expenditure. Thus, from a merely fiscal point, if<lb/> consumption levels of international students were low, e.g. due to individual financial constraints, and they<lb/> had complete access to all public services, the governmental budget might incur a net loss due to an<lb/> international student. This however can change in the medium-to long-run, mainly depending on whether<lb/> international students stay after graduation and successfully integrate themselves into the labour force or<lb/> not. Here, the post-graduation stay rates are of key interest.<lb/> 197.<lb/> Referring to previous considerations with respect to fiscal or economic net contributions after<lb/> graduation, the higher the stay rate, the faster or more likely previous public expenditures can be<lb/> recovered. Both cases, referring to the extremes of the basic funding alternatives (private versus public),<lb/> lead to the conclusion that an optimal fiscal policy should neither focus exclusively on minimising fiscal<lb/> burden of providing tertiary education to international students nor on maximising subsequently generated<lb/> additional (income) tax revenues.<lb/> 198.<lb/> In the presence of highly mobile international graduates, the overall fiscal outcome would not<lb/> only be determined by education policy competition but also by tax competition between host countries. In<lb/> this context, Krieger and Lange (2010) discuss in a fiscal competition model the impact of student and<lb/> labour mobility. They model the mechanisms of interconnected student and graduate mobility on the one<lb/> side and education expenditures and tax rates on the other. Amongst other findings, they establish a<lb/> relationship between international graduates&apos; tax sensitivity and decreasing overall net revenues. This<lb/> effect is mainly driven by a comparative cost advantage when it comes to migration, which allows<lb/> international graduates to leave high taxation countries more easily. This tax base erosion can only<lb/> partially be offset by lowering education expenditure or increasing fees.<lb/> 199.<lb/> In an alternative modelling approach Lange (2013) aims at explaining the impact of changing<lb/> stay rates on optimal tuition fees if some net gains already accrue to the host country during international<lb/> students&apos; study period. This was for example the case if costs of tertiary education in relation to students&apos;<lb/> consumption levels were sufficiently low. If international students correctly anticipate, at the time of their<lb/> initial study choice, a low post-graduation staying probability, their demand for tertiary education abroad<lb/> reacts more sensitively to changes in tuition fees. If international students generate public net gains already<lb/> during studies, lowering tuition fees in case of declining stay rates would be the optimal policy.<lb/> 200.<lb/> The outcome changes however, if international students had irrational, i.e. overly optimistic<lb/> expectations regarding the possibility to stay. If they assume to be able to reap the benefits from a high<lb/> quality education and favourable labour market outcomes in the host country in any case, their demand for<lb/> foreign education is less elastic with respect to tuition fees. Here, rising tuition fees and simultaneously<lb/> declining stay rates might still increase governments&apos; net revenues. Both approaches provide strong<lb/> arguments in favour of a high importance of international students&apos; choice sensitivity regarding host<lb/> countries tuition fees and expectations regarding post-graduation opportunities.<lb/> 201.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Poutvaara (2008)</ref> incorporated the fact that tertiary education may not be equally transferable<lb/> across countries: for example degrees in law may have a rather national relevance, whereas degrees in<lb/> natural sciences should be applicable in an international context – principles of quantum physics do not<lb/> change depending on which side of a border they have been taught, yet paragraphs in fiscal law are likely<lb/> to differ. He established that the national public provision of internationally applicable education, yielding<lb/> positive externalities for other countries as well (due to graduate mobility, fostered e.g. by mobility<lb/> programmes), could remain strictly below a global optimum. A possible suggested solution was the<lb/> introduction of a graduate tax, accruing to the country where a possibly mobile graduate acquired her<lb/> university degree.<lb/> 202.<lb/> A further extension was investigated by Delpierre and Verheyden (2014) who addressed also<lb/> quality of provided education and location preferences of graduates. Optimal funding schemes could<lb/> change in the presence of potentially conflicting priorities of universities and governments. Universities<lb/> might engage in competition for (international) students, by raising quality, whilst governments aimed at<lb/> maximising an economy&apos;s output under fiscal competition. Some resulting inefficiencies, e.g.<lb/> underinvestment in human capital if workers are mobile, could be remedied by transnational transfers for<lb/> mobile students.<lb/> 203.<lb/> Theoretical models&apos; mechanisms and previously presented empirical evidence underscore the<lb/> economic relevance of international students for a host country. Yet, when it comes to defining policy<lb/> measures regarding international students&apos; enrolment, all associated decisions will be made between<lb/> conflicting priorities of fiscal goals, revenue or output maximising aspects in the short-and long-run,<lb/> socio-political necessities and other policy fields.<lb/> 204.<lb/> The complexity of determining an optimal policy (mix) can be easily demonstrated: Higher<lb/> tuition fees for international students might relax short-run fiscal constraints at the cost of lower enrolment<lb/> numbers if students&apos; demand for foreign education is price sensitive. But this in turn might hamper the<lb/> generation of future revenues or economic output, by negatively affecting the overall number of<lb/> prospective stayers<lb/> 205.<lb/> Low tuition fees in contrast could be a suitable policy to attract in a first step brains to fuel the<lb/> knowledge economy. If post-graduation stay rates were at the same time low, this might indicate a certain<lb/> degree of free-riding. Yet, if the policy goal was to export higher education -jointly with low or no tuition<lb/> fees at all, this could be seen as part of a host country&apos;s development assistance -low stay rates for<lb/> international students from developing countries would then indicate a rather successful outcome. As it<lb/> happens, achieving this latter goal seems difficult, as there is evidence that even setting quotas, and<lb/> defining scholarship schemes to foster return to developing countries often fail their purpose (<ref type="biblio">Brekke,<lb/> 2006; Hein and Plesch, 2008</ref>).<lb/> 206.<lb/> This chapter prompts the conclusion that any measure directly or indirectly targeting<lb/> international students&apos; stay rates should only be implemented after having clearly defined a country&apos;s<lb/> policy priorities. Increasing stay rates by all means may produce the desired advantageous result in one<lb/> policy domain, but at the same time come at the price of impairment in another field.<lb/></p>

			<head>6 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>207.<lb/> Empirical results from this study, as well as established findings in the migration literature may<lb/> now serve as point of reference for the derivation of policy recommendations. Presented suggestions<lb/> concern two major questions: how to increase the number of stayers -thus stimulate associated positive<lb/> economic outcomes, and which measures to promote for a reliable investigation of future dynamics?<lb/> 208.<lb/> Answers to the first question address directly the goal of turning international students&apos;<lb/> potential and skills into real gains for the EU in the medium and long-run and these answers might have<lb/> immediate practical implications. Here, the ever present underlying assumption is that higher stay rates<lb/> translate into real socio-economic net gains. The second question is more a technical one, but nevertheless<lb/> an important aspect if internationally mobile students&apos; staying behaviour or the effectiveness of intertwined<lb/> policies shall be evaluated more precisely.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1 Measures to foster international students&apos; attachment to the European host country<lb/></head>

			<p>209.<lb/> Although some plausible determinants of stay rates have been identified, not all empirical<lb/> findings may be translated into tangible policy measures: for instance, it is just not possible to reduce<lb/> geographical distance between a country of origin and a destination country. Nevertheless, there might be<lb/> some policies which have the potential to strengthen the EU&apos;s retention capabilities by increasing<lb/> countries&apos; or individuals&apos; &apos;proximity&apos; in other domains, e.g. in the sense of reducing barriers to integration<lb/> and by lowering associated costs.<lb/> 210.<lb/> The overarching goal has to be to foster international students&apos; attachment to EU host countries<lb/> and to facilitate integration in general as well as into the labour market in particular. As the main leverage<lb/> points for retaining talents in the EU have been identified the following aspects:<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Group specific recruitment<lb/></head>

			<p>International students from some countries of origin display a higher inclination towards staying in the<lb/> EU than others. Furthermore, focusing on undergraduate international students implies that these<lb/> students have more time to get familiar with a host country&apos;s culture, language and administrative<lb/> procedures. This in turn reduces the effective (and perceived) obstacles for staying after graduation.<lb/> Recruiting and educating more of these likely stayers would then subsequently translate into higher<lb/> numbers of stayers.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. Granting funding for advanced studies<lb/> Scholarship programmes&apos; negative monetary incentives, i.e. to induce return after graduation, appear<lb/> to be ineffective. The other way round, providing funding to doctoral students and offering them the<lb/> opportunity to become more familiar with host country specific research fields strengthens their<lb/> attachment to the host country and reduces financial insecurity. Funding schemes could be<lb/> concentrated in those areas which are perceived to suffer from a certain &apos;brain&apos; shortage. This might<lb/> be achievable within the framework of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions and explicitly address<lb/> international students at the end of their masters&apos; programme, just when they decide whether to stay or<lb/> to return. Most importantly, funding opportunities have to be made publicly known in the designated<lb/> target group.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Language courses<lb/></head>

			<p>Even if more and more study programmes are taught in English, most EU countries&apos; business and<lb/> daily life language is not English. Offering more intensive high-quality language courses and setting<lb/> incentives for participation during studies will reduce actual or perceived comparative disadvantages<lb/> regarding employment. As taking additional courses implies higher workload, an integration of these<lb/> courses into the ECTS system deems advisable. As such courses foster social inclusion, tapping the<lb/> European Social Fund to support high-quality language courses at universities or for university<lb/> students could be a feasible solution.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Labour market policies<lb/></head>

			<p>As the analysis of labour market outcomes has shown, there are some dimensions where international<lb/> graduate stayers find themselves in a less favourable situation: they tend to be more often in part-time<lb/> and less adequate employment, considering their educational attainment. Here, providing additional<lb/> support, e.g. by financing seminars specifically designed for introducing international students to<lb/> national peculiarities of an application process, might improve their integration into the labour market.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, all essential information from employment agencies should be available not solely in the<lb/> national language, but at least in English or other major languages. This would facilitate the<lb/> understanding of administrative procedures and job search itself.<lb/> From a general point of view, there remain also some policy issues on the macro level: although<lb/> international graduate stayers are willing and able to integrate themselves into a host country&apos;s labour<lb/> market, their willingness to stay is certainly depending on the specific labour market situation. Current<lb/> labour market conditions in some larger EU countries signal however a certain degree of saturation<lb/> regarding tertiary educated labour. If more international graduates are to be kept in order to cope with<lb/> future demographic trends, these underlying adverse labour market conditions for young professionals<lb/> should be addressed first.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Political stability and participation<lb/></head>

			<p>Empirical findings indicate that stay rates are higher in politically stable countries and those where the<lb/> possibility for political participation is more pronounced. Whilst the first aspect can be seen as<lb/> guaranteed in any EU member state, more participation opportunities for third country nationals might<lb/> improve their inclination towards staying: if a foreign national contributes to a country&apos;s economic<lb/> and social success he or she should also be given a voice. In this regard, a harmonization of EU<lb/> nationals&apos; and third country nationals&apos; rights would represent a credible commitment.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Institutional design and governance<lb/></head>

			<p>Properly working institutions, which handle administrative procedures not only transparently but also<lb/> promptly, are important. For instance, if the processing of visa takes too long, an international<lb/> graduate who would have otherwise found skill-adequate employment in the host country might take<lb/> up a job offer in the country of origin. Furthermore, administrative processes should be designed in<lb/> such a way that they can be understood and appropriately prepared by someone who is not familiar<lb/> with country-specific administrative hurdles.<lb/></p>

			<head>7. Innovative and competitive environment<lb/></head>

			<p>Keeping the brightest requires being able to offer them an interesting and challenging working or<lb/> living environment. This holds especially true when it comes to graduates in the technical or<lb/> engineering field, and especially for researchers -keeping their ideas means providing them with an<lb/> opportunity to realise these ideas. This in turn strengthens the importance of preserving or even<lb/> increasing technological competitiveness: private and public R&amp;D expenditures have to mirror such<lb/> an aspiration. Furthermore, a research and innovation friendly environment – in a political and social<lb/> dimension alike – is important as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>211.<lb/> Potential graduate stayers have probably gained some experience with respect to the<lb/> performance of a host country in some of the above mentioned domains. Being well educated, highly<lb/> mobile and possibly also being a sought employee abroad, they will base their decision to stay to a large<lb/> extent on whether a respective EU member state meets their expectations or not. In the end it is not about<lb/> announcing a welcoming culture but about adopting concrete measures which actually translate into a<lb/> working and living environment offering real opportunities for those we want to stay.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2 Monitoring international graduates&apos; residential choices<lb/></head>

			<p>212.<lb/> Previous chapters&apos; elaborations adverted briefly to some drawbacks regarding the various<lb/> methods to assess international graduates&apos; staying behaviour. Aside from general reliability issues,<lb/> insufficient data coverage and harmonization have been identified as additional limitations in the extended<lb/> version of this paper. Furthermore, all investigated calculation methods can only provide information with<lb/> respect to short-term staying behaviour.<lb/> 213.<lb/> Especially the latter deserves some additional considerations as such short-term outcomes might<lb/> be poor predictors for medium-or long-term staying behaviour: if studying abroad and starting the career<lb/> abroad is only seen as one way to increase human capital, e.g. by acquiring international experience, the<lb/> return to a country of origin might have been always part of an individual career plan (<ref type="biblio">Perkins and<lb/> Neumayer, 2013; Findlay et al., 2012</ref>). Consequently, short-term stay rates in EU countries might be high<lb/> whilst long-term rates could be very low. This implies that those who have been educated in an EU<lb/> country, gathered country-specific human capital and first practical working experience were afterwards<lb/> likely to leave – probably exactly at a point where they reached a high productivity level.<lb/> 214.<lb/> Hence, for the EU to benefit from international graduates&apos; in an extensive way, the goal should<lb/> not be to concentrate exclusively on short-term staying behaviour, but to ensure that the EU remains<lb/> attractive for these individuals for a longer period. Yet, to evaluate whether the EU achieves this objective,<lb/> reliable medium-and long-term stay rates have to be derived. At the present state it is infeasible to obtain<lb/> such measures on the scale of the EU due to a lack of adequate data. In the following, two possible<lb/> approaches to resolve this issue are briefly sketched.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Augmenting EU-LFS<lb/></head>

			<p>The basic issue regarding the identification of stayers in the LFS is related to the country of university<lb/> graduation. Currently, it can only be inferred one year after graduation via country of residence at the<lb/> graduation year – this implies directly its short-term nature. If the basic set of items regarding highest<lb/> education attained (level, field and year) was supplemented by &apos;region of graduation&apos;, international<lb/> graduates would be easier to identify and trace over time. This basic adjustment would remove all<lb/> doubts regarding the identification of stayers amongst the set of internationally mobile students.<lb/> Although such a modification would constitute a significant improvement, only a partial picture of<lb/> international graduates&apos; mobility could be derived, namely cohort-specific stay rates for í µí± and í µí± − 1<lb/> years after graduation. Additional elicitation of the region of work or residence in the year after<lb/> graduation would further allow determining a cohorts&apos; short-run stay rate, even if some time has<lb/> elapsed between graduation and respective survey year.<lb/> Two remarks remain: First, the larger í µí± the fewer stayers can be expected. This might conflict with<lb/> reliability thresholds once again. Second, this simple modification would not enable any inference<lb/> regarding mobility or migratory events after the first year after graduation and before year í µí± − 1.<lb/> Nevertheless it constituted a substantial improvement regarding capturing more facets of dynamic<lb/> staying behaviour in the EU-LFS.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Harmonized graduate survey on the national level<lb/></head>

			<p>To avoid the underlying pitfalls related to usage of EU-LFS data, a graduate survey could be suitable<lb/> to derive short-and medium-run stay rates. Since a survey targeting potentially highly mobile<lb/> individuals suffers probably from high non-response, likely to increase over time, and small sample<lb/> size, a special procedure is proposed: implementation as an event history calendar for international<lb/> graduates from nationally representative universities. The so-called event history calendar (<ref type="biblio">Sage et al.,<lb/> 2013</ref>) can be set up as an online-based tool which asks participants to report status changes. These<lb/> changes may cover changes of employment status, residence change but also cover other topics of<lb/> interest, which allows then an analysis with respect to determinants of staying (or returning) behaviour<lb/> on the subject level. Such an approach would in fact account for detailed mobility-related experiences<lb/> in a medium-term time horizon, for example three to five years.<lb/> Participants, however, should be offered some incentive to report changes constantly and to avoid<lb/> increasing non-response levels. This necessity implies that a restriction to a subset of universities was<lb/> unavoidable. These participating universities should host an international student body of substantial<lb/> size whilst offering a wide range of programmes and fields of study. A positive and required by-<lb/>product of involving specific universities is that university-specific numbers of international<lb/> graduates, possibly even by field and sex, could be obtained concurrently.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whilst the first approach would be easier to implement, as it does not involve the development of a specific<lb/> tool on the European level, the second was suitable to deliver more detailed insights into sub-groups&apos;<lb/> staying behaviour. Furthermore, detailed determinants of international graduates&apos; mobility could be<lb/> investigated as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both approaches would constitute a significant improvement to the current state regarding the examination<lb/> of dynamic staying behaviour of international students and graduates. If we want to understand what<lb/> makes them stay in a longer perspective, we need a reliable and transnationally comparable data source.<lb/></p>

			<head>7 SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>215.<lb/> This report investigated the preferences of internationally mobile students with a special focus<lb/> on post-graduation mobility. The key findings emerging during this research project, as well as the main<lb/> implications will be briefly summarised below.<lb/> 216.<lb/> Some stylised facts on the distribution of internationally mobile students in the EU:<lb/>  With almost 1.5 million international students enrolled in 2012, the 28 EU countries constitute still the<lb/> most attractive destination area for studying abroad -38 percent of all internationally mobile students<lb/> chose the EU in 2012. However, Asian destination countries are becoming increasingly more popular.<lb/>  Approximately two thirds of internationally mobile students in the EU come from outside the EU.<lb/>  Students from Asia and Latin America choose the EU as a destination much more frequently than 10<lb/> years ago. This mirrors the growing importance of these countries in the global context.<lb/>  Some EU countries are primarily destinations in the context of intra-EU mobility (Austria, Belgium,<lb/> Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovakia). Others are especially attractive<lb/> for students from non-EU and non-OECD countries, as the composition of their international student<lb/> body displays (Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania and Sweden).<lb/>  Geographical proximity, historical ties and language similarities seem to contribute in a substantial way<lb/> to students&apos; country preferences.<lb/>  Some countries, in particular (?)their higher education institutions, attract male and female students in<lb/> different ways, which is likely associated with the curriculum offered by study programmes.<lb/>  Aside from some Eastern European countries, the preferred field of study is social sciences, business<lb/> and law. Most frequently chosen studies in these Eastern EU members belong to the field of health<lb/> and welfare.<lb/> 217.<lb/> The main insights from the exploratory study part 45 concern the identification and discussion of<lb/> internationally mobile students&apos; staying behaviour:<lb/>  Typically, measures of staying or returning behaviour of internationally mobile students in the<lb/> literature vary drastically for destination countries. This variation originates from a multitude of<lb/> sources, such as countries of origin, reference year, time horizon, calculation procedure, underlying<lb/> data source and type of student (e.g. Germany: 9 – 77.5%, the Netherlands: 29 – 94%, United<lb/> Kingdom: 3 – 64%).<lb/>  More than a dozen alternative calculation methods were evaluated in the context of EU destination<lb/> countries. Some of these examined methods generated for over 170 countries of origin specific stay<lb/> rates.<lb/>  Within the exploratory study, a substantial degree of between-method variation could be observed on<lb/> the EU member state level. This phenomenon is mainly driven by small sample sizes, data quality and<lb/> partial violation of required assumptions. To mitigate stay rates&apos; sensitivity to those issues, stay rates<lb/> have been constructed in most cases as three year average over the years 2010 to 2012.<lb/>  For the EU as a whole, aggregate stay rates from stayers from all non-EU source countries lie within a<lb/> range of 16.4 to 29.1%.<lb/>  Derived stay rates on the EU level are especially high for students from North-Western Africa and the<lb/> Commonwealth of Independent States. Large enrolment numbers do not automatically imply high stay<lb/> rates; for instance Chinese students, being by far the largest group, display only a stay rate between<lb/> 13.7 and 15.5%.<lb/>  Current data sources only allow assessing short-term stay rates (6-12 months after the end of studies),<lb/> this implies that the dynamic nature of subsequent staying decisions at a later career stage cannot be<lb/> analysed.<lb/> 218.<lb/> Taking into account potential shortcomings of permit based stay rates these bilateral measures<lb/> nevertheless offer the opportunity to investigate potential determinants of staying behaviour. The most<lb/> essential results are the following ones:<lb/></p>

			<p> Internationally mobile students see their studies abroad as an integral part of their career path.<lb/> Subsequent staying decisions are not taken lightly but made in light of perceived opportunities.<lb/>  Addressing the impact of perceived opportunities by observable differences between destination and<lb/> source countries in socio-economic or socio-political dimensions provides valuable insights on an<lb/> aggregate level.<lb/>  Similarity between host and source countries&apos; language are associated with higher stay rates. A larger<lb/> distance between these countries, reflecting higher monetary costs of migration and lower degrees of<lb/> cultural proximity, is indicative of lower stay rates.<lb/>  Assuming that internationally mobile students base their staying or returning decision purely on<lb/> economic differentials around their graduation might be too short-sighted.<lb/>  Higher general unemployment has not necessarily a deterring effect. Tertiary educated workers might<lb/> still be able to find employment in a niche, according to their qualification.<lb/>  If an EU host country scores better regarding institutional quality and governance effectiveness, higher<lb/> stay rates can be observed. This gives rise to the claim that stayers prefer a &apos;reliable&apos; business or daily<lb/> life environment.<lb/>  In a similar manner, higher scores regarding technological readiness and innovation serve as predictors<lb/> for higher stay rates.<lb/>  Living circumstances in general have to be considered as relevant factors as well – more pronounced<lb/> levels of political stability and absence of violence are associated with more likely staying decisions.<lb/> But if (political) participation opportunities are more developed in the home country, return becomes<lb/> more likely.<lb/>  These possible determinants deliver a plausible explanation why stay rates amongst students from other<lb/> OECD countries are typically very low and stay rates from students from less developed or politically<lb/> less stable countries are much higher.<lb/> 219.<lb/> Examining the impact of post-graduation staying decision on European economies allowed<lb/> drawing the following conclusions:<lb/>  Regarding labour market outcomes, those internationally mobile students who decide to stay are likely<lb/> to be positively selected, especially if permission to stay is only granted in case of employment.<lb/>  International stayers have an employment rate which is at least as high as for their domestic peers.<lb/> Unemployment is also not more frequent amongst stayers. The subsample of stayers from other EU<lb/> countries is more often self-employed.<lb/>  Part-time employment is more widespread amongst international stayers, partially due to the fact that<lb/> this group consists to a larger extent of married women. A positive selection of stayers explains also<lb/> why they have a higher likelihood of having found permanent employment.<lb/>  Whilst there are no significant differences regarding income, international stayers face a much higher<lb/> probability of working in a job requiring only medium or low skills. This is mainly driven by stayers<lb/> from non-EU countries and points to problematic skill mismatches.<lb/>  Fields of study and preferred residential locations of international stayers lead to the conclusion that<lb/> they have a low inclination towards selecting themselves into labour market segments with alleged<lb/> shortages – they strictly prefer metropolitan areas and are not more likely to have graduated in the<lb/> fields of &quot; science, mathematics and computing &quot; , &quot; engineering, manufacturing and construction &quot; or<lb/> &quot; health and welfare &quot; .<lb/>  Current labour market conditions, i.e. increasing unemployment rates for tertiary educated labour<lb/> below 30 years of age and declining real wages for young professionals in some larger EU economies,<lb/> are neither favourable nor fostering the attractiveness of the EU labour market(s).<lb/>  International stayers can be expected to become net contributors to EU economies by no later than<lb/> graduation. But already during their studies, their consumption of commodity and services adds to the<lb/> host country&apos;s demand.<lb/>  Fiscal implications of providing funding for the education of internationally mobile students and<lb/> related inefficiencies due to externalities could be taken into account, for instance by conditioning<lb/> subsidies on subsequent staying behaviour.<lb/> 220.<lb/> Considering all above mentioned findings, two main policy recommendations can be distilled.<lb/> The first one refers to structural data deficiencies which prevent a more in-depth analysis: to broaden<lb/> analytical possibilities in this line of research, the harmonisation of existing data series should be<lb/> promoted. Relevant dynamic aspects, regarding the retention of internationally mobile students after<lb/> graduation in a medium-or long-run, can only be addressed if either the EU-LFS is slightly extended or a<lb/> representative sample of international graduates participates in an online based survey. But, once again<lb/> referring to the introductory Wilson quote, exactly such a medium-to long-term analysis enables to assess<lb/> for how long the EU can &apos;borrow&apos; the brains of internationally mobile academics.<lb/> 221.<lb/> The second recommendation encompasses a catalogue of measures to boost the EU&apos;s<lb/> attractiveness, hence to increase stay rates. Proposed policy measures draw on a smooth labour market<lb/> integration of international graduates by setting further incentives to remove language barriers already<lb/> during studies or providing support regarding country-specific labour market peculiarities. Actively<lb/> supporting post-graduate studies seems to be another promising way to increase retention of international<lb/> talents in a medium-run. At the same time, the EU and all its members are well advised not only to<lb/> maintain, but to cultivate their strong points: political stability and participation possibilities, reliable<lb/> institutions and governance structure, as well as an innovative and competitive environment – all these<lb/> aspects exert a non-negligible influence on the decision to stay of highly-skilled, but also highly-mobile,<lb/> individuals.<lb/> 222.<lb/> If we want to turn the potential, ensuing from a huge pool of internationally mobile students,<lb/> into real and lasting gains for the EU, we should provide these individuals with long-term perspectives, not<lb/> only long-term permits.<lb/></p>
