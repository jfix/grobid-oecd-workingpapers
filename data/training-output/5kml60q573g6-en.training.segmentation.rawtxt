EUROPEAN UNION THAT JOINED THE UNION ON 1 MAY 2004 SIGMA PAPER NO. 42 The European Commission requested Sigma to carry out a study on the regulatory management capacities of the 
ten countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 to learn more about their Better Regulation practices, exchange 
good practices and make suggestions for further improvements. This study was carried out by way of peer 
reviews taking place between March 2005 and October 2006. 
The topics examined were notably: the origins of EU Better Regulation policy, regulatory management 
processes, the tools used in these processes (impact assessment, consultation, simplification, alternatives and 
accessibility), enactment processes and the enforcement and compliance of laws in the NMS, with reference to 
intellectual property law and environmental laws. 
Each peer reviews led to a country report that was sent to the Commission and the Member State in question. 
Publication of each country report was left to the discretion of the Member State in question. A synthesis was 
drawn up summarizing all findings and making recommendations addressed to all new Member States in 
general. For further information please contact Mr. Edward Donelan, Sigma:

the main challenges recognised by the European Union in the original Lisbon strategy and the 
renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (adopted in 2000 and 2005 respectively). The 
improvement of the regulatory environment and regulatory processes at the level of the 
Institutions of the EU and its Member States is a key factor in creating a business environment 
conducive to productivity growth. This policy is known as 'Better Regulation.' This policy does not mean more regulation or less 
regulation but involves the putting in place of processes which ensure that all regulations are 
easy to understand, apply, comply with and are of high quality. Regulation plays a central role in the functioning of economies and is essential to address market 
failures, foster competition, promote safety, health and welfare and facilitate the protection of the 
environment. High quality regulation achieves these objectives at least possible cost. Low quality 
regulation may have the opposite effect. Review of the Regulatory Management Capacities of Each of the NMS Much is known about the implementation of Better Regulation policy in the Institutions of the EU 
and in some Member States of the EU. Less is known about the implementation of Better 
Regulation policy in the 10 countries that joined the EU on the 1 st May 2004 (NMS). In order to 
learn more about developments in Better Regulation in the 10 NMS, the European Commission 
requested Sigma to study this issue. The studies were designed, primarily, as fact finding exercises and did not judge the quality of 
their regulations and were used as a means to encourage the development of Better Regulation 
policy. This report is a synthesis of these studies which were conducted between March 2005 
and October 2006. The studies examined: the origins of EU Better Regulation policy to provide a context for the 
studies, regulatory management processes, the tools used in these processes (impact 
assessment, consultation, simplification, alternatives and accessibility), enactment processes 
and the enforcement and compliance of laws in the NMS, with reference to intellectual property 
law and environmental laws. The NMS are geographically and culturally diverse but share the experience of adopting the 
acquis communautaire in a remarkably short period and now face the pressure of interpreting it 
and applying it to their own conditions. Eight of these countries experienced an acceleration of 
history as they moved from command and control economies to free market economies. This 
meant not only the adaptation of their economies but also significant and substantial changes to 
their administrative cultures and political institutional environments. Conclusions 1. Political leadership will be necessary to encourage sustained attention to Better 
Regulation policy, accordingly, Better Regulation Units need to engage political attention GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 8 through seminars and debates which promote an understanding of Better Regulation 
issues. 2. The development of a Better Regulation policy and the improvement of regulatory 
management capacities is an issue which is competing with a significant number of 
other issues, all of pressing importance. NMS need time to absorb the changes they 
have experienced as a result of their application for EU membership, in particular the 
incorporation of the acquis communautaire and for many of them the switch to an open 
market economy. The responsibility for the development of Better Regulation in the 
NMS falls on the shoulders of a dedicated but small number of officials. The challenge 
for the NMS is to recognize that this is not just as a 'one shot' policy but is something 
which requires sustained commitment to improvement. 3. There is a widespread understanding in all NMS of the necessity to use Better 
Regulation tools. However, many NMS enacted laws to oblige officials to prepare 
impact assessments for all new legislation. These laws were rarely underpinned by 
adequate methodologies or institutional arrangements to oversee the quality of 
assessments. As a result, the potential benefits from the use of this tool were lost. 4. Most NMS are addressing this problem but the approach to impact assessment is an 
example of a wider problem, namely, the belief that the enactment of a law is a sufficient 
activity for the solution of a policy problem. As well as enacting laws, NMS need to 
address the necessity to support new laws with adequate institutional arrangements to 
ensure that they are enforced or complied with. 5. All NMS recognise the need to measure the size of administrative costs and, where 
possible, take steps to reduce them. Progress may be seen across the NMS in both 
measuring the costs and reviewing administrative procedures, frequency of inspections 
and related official activities to ensure the burden on people, and small businesses in 
particular, is kept to a minimum. This is a very positive development which should be 
encouraged and supported, where possible, by the Institutions of the EU. 6. In addition, the executive and legislative branches of government need to work together 
and follow common policies to achieve Better Regulation. Many of the NMS have 
experienced recent political turmoil. Participants in all parts of the political process need 
to develop a deeper understand that priority should be given to a good regulatory 
environment to safeguard and encourage the competitiveness of their economies. In the 
review of the quality of regulations both branches of government need to adopt a more 
multidisciplinary approach where regulations are reviewed against the application of 
Better Regulation principles as well as legal effectiveness issues. 7. In all NMS, there is a need to review enforcement and compliance policies to discover if 
there are better ways of ensuring that, once laws, are enacted they are enforced or 
complied with in a manner that achieves the result intended. This is also an issue that 
may be usefully addressed at the level of the Institutions of the EU and offers a rich field 
for future cooperation. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 9 Recommendations Common to all NMS The report makes recommendations that are common to all NMS: 1. Political support is essential to develop and maintain a policy on Better Regulation. 2. A policy to achieve Better Regulation works best when there are appropriate and 
adequately-funded arrangements in place to support and maintain it. 3. Regulatory management capacities may be developed through the effective use of 
Better Regulation tools. 4. Executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate in a constructive way 
to ensure wise governance. 5. More attention needs to be paid to enforcement and compliance. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 10 1. 
INTRODUCTION This Report is a synthesis of assessments of the regulatory management capacities of the 10 
New Member States that joined the EU on the 1 st May 2004 (the NMS). This section sets out the background to the report, describes the methodology used and explains 
what the report covers and what it excludes. It provides a brief overview of the NMS and explains the subject matter of the report. Background to Report Enhancing the competitiveness of its economy through increased productivity growth is one of 
the main challenges recognised by the European Union in the original Lisbon strategy and the 
renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (2000 and 2005). The improvement of the 
regulatory environment and regulatory processes at the level of the Institutions of the EU and its 
Member States through developing a Better Regulation policy is a key factor in creating a 
business environment conducive to productivity growth. Regulation plays a central role in the functioning of economies and is essential in addressing 
market failures, fostering competition, promoting safety, health and welfare and facilitating the 
protection of the environment. High quality regulation achieves these objectives. Low quality 
regulation may have the opposite effect. The European Commission has developed a Better 
Regulation policy designed to improve its regulatory management capacities. The policy 
functions at the level of all institutions to improve the flow of new regulations and the existing 
stock of regulations. OECD Reports on Regulatory Reform The OECD has published a series of Reports on Regulatory Reform for most OECD countries. 
These Reports include a chapter on the capacity of these countries to produce high quality 
regulations. From these studies, some understanding may be gleaned about the regulatory 
management capacities of certain EU Member States. However, no such studies existed for the 
NMS, except the OECD reports on regulatory reform in the Czech Republic, Hungary and 
Poland. The European Commission wanted to get a better understanding of the regulatory management 
capacities of the NMS and to promote the adoption of a Better Regulation policy in all Member 
States, similar to those adopted by the Institutions of the EU. With this objective, the European 
Commission requested Sigma to assess the regulatory management capacities of the NMS. A 
report setting out the assessment for each NMS was prepared and given to each NMS and the 
European Commission. The individual NMS reports were not published by the European Commission as they are 
documents internal to them and to the governments concerned. However, the NMS were free to 
translate and publish the reports or to adapt the material in them for their own policy needs. The 
reports for the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia were 
translated and made available in these NMS. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 11 Issues Examined The assessments were undertaken by reference to a baseline, set out in Annex 2, created for 
the purpose of the 10 assessments. The assessments sought to examine 5 areas: 1. The existence of a policy as regards regulatory management and the extent to which it 
has developed into a policy to improve regulation (Better Regulation). 2. The formulation of policy, drafting of regulations1, the process for assuring regulatory 
quality for both 'flow' of new regulations and 'stock' of existing regulations. 3. The enactment process. 4. Enforcement and compliance mechanisms. The baseline was drawn up specifically for this project and does not appear in any other literature 
on the subject. Issues not Examined The assessments of the regulatory management capacities of the NMS, upon which this 
synthesis is based, did not seek to judge whether regulations made in the Member States 
concerned were well or badly made or whether legislation in NMS is of high quality. Nor did the 
process seek to judge whether Member States were overregulated or not. The assessments 
were concerned with identifying the extent to which the regulatory management capacities of 
NMS measured up against a baseline designed for this study and to what extent Better regulation 
type policies were developing in those countries. The assessments made recommendations for reforms to each NMS, most of which were 
accepted as being in line with their own actual or planned policies. Methodology The preparation of the report on the NMS followed three phases: set up, peer review and fact 
checking. The set up phase included the development of a benchmark or baseline against which 
the regulatory management capacities of the NMS would be studied. A questionnaire (Annex 3) 
was also drawn up and submitted to each NMS. Each New Member State was visited by a peer team for five consecutive working days. A panel 
of peers was selected for the process (Annex 4). The peers were selected on the basis of their 
knowledge, experience and standing in relation to Better Regulation issues and were drawn from 
the Directors of Better Regulation Network 2 and the OECD Working Party on regulatory 
management. Three peers were selected for each mission to a NMS. The particular peers selected for each 
mission were chosen to provide a mix of skills, knowledge and experience in relevant fields: 
administration, legal systems and economic policy issues. They were also selected to achieve a 
geographic spread and a balanced representation of different administrative and legal systems. A 1 The word 'regulation' is used throughout the text to mean legal or administrative instruments to achieve policy objectives. The 
term 'regulation' is in more common usage by economists and political scientists in the wide sense of achieving policy 
outcomes. Lawyers use the word 'regulation' to refer to secondary legislation. The study reflects much of the thinking that has 
taken place in the OECD on this subject and reports written in this field use the word 'regulation' more frequently than 
'legislation'. Hence, the word 'regulation' is used as often as possible. However, from time to time, this report for clarity uses 
'legislation' and this is the term most familiar to officials with legal qualifications. 'Legislation' is further classified into primary 
laws (made by parliaments) and secondary laws (made under the authority of primary legislation). 2 An informal grouping of EU's governments' Directors of Better Regulation, which meets twice annually. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 12 report was drafted in respect of each NMS, agreed between the peers, and submitted to the NMS 
for fact checking. Process The peer review process used was designed to develop a policy dialogue within the NMS and 
between the NMS and the peers as well as to examine and to identify potential strengths, 
weaknesses or gaps in the institutional, policy and policy tools framework for regulatory 
management. This process resulted in a lively exchange of views in most NMS and a spirit of 
exchanged successes and failures. Given the importance of Better Regulation to the Lisbon 
Agenda, the assessment of each NMS sought evidence of regulatory management capacities 
generally and, particularly, the capacity to adopt, implement and develop a Better Regulation 
policy. The exercise was also designed to highlight policies that have worked well in NMS and, 
through the peers, to provide information to NMS as well as to identify areas where 
improvements could be brought about. Related to this process, seminars were organised in six NMS, 3 which enabled experts to be 
brought from other Member States and enabled a wide number of officials to hear about Better 
Regulation and the review process. In addition, the Ministry for the Economy in Poland 
organised a successful and well attended conference on Better Regulation in the NMS. NMS — Overview The NMS share many matters in common as regards regulatory management policy. All have 
engaged in one way or another with the development of policies that are similar in objectives to 
those adopted by the Institutions of the European Union, and other countries as part of a world 
wide trend towards a Better Regulation agenda. Much progress has been made and many 
developments have taken place between the initiation of the project and its completion. The 
following Table gives a flavour of what has happened and is intended to be illustrative of 
progress rather than a comprehensive overview, which would require regular updating. 3 See, for example, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta www.mcmp.gov.mt/newsdetail.asp?i=126) and the 
Slovak Republic. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 13 Some Examples of Best Practice and Proposed Developments NMS 
Best Practice 4 Proposed Developments Czech Republic 
(Fact check 
11 December 2006) The Government of the Czech Republic adopted 
an Action Plan of Reducing Administrative 
Burden on Businesses in April 2005, as well as a 
Methodology of Measurement of Administrative 
Burden, based on the Dutch Standard Cost 
Model. 
5 According to the plan, the Head of the 
Office of the Government was responsible for the 
drawing up of a report (Analysis of Administrative 
Burden on Businesses) based on results of 
measurements undertaken by particular 
ministries and central state administration 
authorities. The Czech Republic has 
strengthened its capacity to 
deliver its Better Regulation 
policy and has developed a 
new methodology for impact 
assessment. Cyprus 
(Fact check Cyprus 
5 June 2006) The first 'One-Stop-Shop' for citizens was opened 
in December 2005 so as to deliver better access 
to certain categories of government information 
and a range of services It brings together the 
following services: identity documents, car 
registration, health and social benefits. It is an 
additional facility provided for the convenience of 
the public and services continue to be offered in 
the specific offices of each ministry. The 
One-Stop-Shop is staffed with seconded staff 
from the various relevant ministries. It is intended 
as a showpiece of the government's policy to 
make administration more accessible to the 
public. Cyprus has appointed a 
Working Party to investigate 
the means by which impact 
assessment may be 
incorporated into the 
policy-making process. A 
second 'One Stop Shop' 
was opened in October 
2006 and a third is planned 
to be opened by February 
2007. Estonia 
(Fact check 
15 June 2006) An e.government tool to facilitate consultation, 
called Web 'Talk along', 
6 has been developed. It 
permits the involvement of citizens in the 
formulation of policy and the drafting of 
legislation. Businesses may now be 
established in less than two 
months and consideration is 
being given to the 
development of an explicit 
policy on Better Regulation. 
Two new Standards Cost 
projects (transport and 
structural funds) and a 
simplification programme 
are planned. Hungary 
(Fact check 
15 August 2006) In 2004, two initiatives to provide training for 
officials in modern administration, including Better 
Regulation, were introduced. The first is in 
Budapest; the second in Perch University, which 
started a Better Regulation curriculum for local 
authority lawyers. Training aims to give officials 
the capacity to undertake and manage an impact 
assessment project. Project to assess 
effectiveness of regulatory 
impact assessments 
underway. Decision taken to 
assess regulatory burdens 
internal to Ministry of 
Justice. 4 The information set out in this table was correct at the time of the completion of each country report. 5 Resolution (No. 421/2005). 6 www.mkm.ee/index.php?id=8252. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 14 Latvia 
(Fact check 
17 May 2006) A distinctive feature of the Latvian system of 
governance is that a representative of NGOs and 
professional associations may attend the State 
Secretaries' meetings as an observer. This 
feature ensures that civil society can be made 
aware, through a network of NGOs and 
professional associations, of developments in 
policy and proposals for new regulations. The 
process is structured so that NGOs and 
professional associations may submit comments 
on draft policies and draft regulations. It is planned to develop a 
standard cost model and an 
ad hoc simplification 
programme is underway. Lithuania 
(Fact check 
19 Sept 2005) A crucial factor in regulatory management is the 
speedy resolution of disputes. The Chief 
Administrative Disputes' Commission hears 
claims and resolves disputes in respect of the 
legality of administrative decisions. Lithuania translated and 
published the Sigma report 
into Lithuanian and is 
heading towards the 
development of a 
substantial Better 
Regulation policy. Malta 
(Fact check 
28 July 2006) There is a Management Efficiency Unit in the 
Office of the Prime Minister. The Unit includes the 
newly established Better Regulation Unit and is 
an interesting model to drive Better Regulation 
reforms as it is at the centre of Government and 
at the same time an integral part of the Public 
Service as a whole. Proposed development of 
RIA policy. Poland 
(Fact check 
10 October 2006) There is an inter-ministerial working group (the 
Task Force for Modern Economic Regulation) to 
develop Better Regulation policy; a team in the 
Ministry for the Economy and an official in each 
Ministry is responsible for the development of 
Better Regulation in that Ministry. As of 2006, an explicit 
Better Regulation strategy is 
being developed in Poland. 
On 19 August 2006, the 
Council of Ministers adopted 
the Regulatory Reform 
Programme. It is the first 
comprehensive regulatory 
reform programme in 
Poland defining an 
integrated approach to 
regulatory management 
policy. 
The programme includes a 
three-stage plan for the 
implementation of the 
Standard Cost Model (SCM) 
for measuring administrative 
costs of regulation. On 10 
October 2006, a revised RIA 
methodology was adopted 
by the Council of Ministers – 
the Guidelines for 
Regulatory Impact 
Assessment. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 15 Slovak Republic 
(Fact check 
4 Sept 2006) A novel feature of its impact assessment system 
is to assess the impact of proposed legislation on 
households. Review of its impact 
assessment policy and 
development of a new 
methodology. Slovenia 
(Fact check 
8 December 2006) There is a Programme of Measures for Reduction 
of Administrative Burdens which aims to reduce 
administrative barriers, ensure that public 
administration is friendly, effective, open and 
transparent, and provide impetus for the rapid 
development of e-government. All ministries are 
preparing work plans for the 2007-2008 period to 
reduce administrative burdens. The establishment in 2006 
of a special group to 
oversee Better Regulation 
was a significant move 
towards the development of 
a comprehensive Better 
Regulation policy. Period of Rapid Change The NMS formerly under communist influence have undergone a period of rapid and substantial 
change in their adaptation from 'command and control' economies to free market and have 
undertaken the changes necessary to adopt the acquis communautaire. In a relatively short period of time, those NMS had to build new institutional capacities or develop 
and adapt old ones. Cyprus and Malta did not have to address the issues associated with 
developing a free market but had to address the challenge of adopting a substantial volume of 
new legislation so as to comply with the acquis communautaire, without the benefit of the kind of 
aid and assistance made available to the other NMS. Cyprus and Malta had the advantage of legal systems and institutional structures which had 
developed over a long period of time. This advantage had to be weighed against the fact that 
they were small NMS with an administrative capacity already stretched to cover domestic needs. All NMS faced an acceleration of history. An assessment of the full impact of this acceleration will 
be needed later, in the light of whether it succeeds or fails and why. At the time the assessments 
were undertaken, all NMS were breathing a sigh of relief that the challenge of adoption of the 
acquis communautaire had been met. The peer teams shared the experience of, on the one hand, seeing a rich harvest of 
administrative, economic, political and social change and, on the other hand, seeing fields that 
had just been seeded needing time for the seeds to sprout and grow. A new generation of officials has emerged in these countries and it is fortunate that the challenge 
of improving regulatory management is being taken up by that generation. General Challenges Five broad challenges face all NMS: the need to sustain political support; the need to undertake 
impact assessment in substance as well as in form; efficiency, as well as legal effectiveness is a 
key determinant of good quality regulation; parliaments need to pay attention also to Better 
Regulation issues and enforcement policy needs more consideration. Political Support Needs to be Sustained Political support for Better Regulation is present in all the NMS studied. However, further support 
and encouragement will be needed to sustain progress. Political support for the introduction of 
policies on Better Regulation is more visible than tangible political support for its implementation. Some NMS (Czech Republic and Poland) had adopted explicit policies on Better Regulation 
before the peer review process. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 16 Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, and Slovenia were in the process of adopting such a policy and the 
other states were either considering the adoption of an explicit policy or believed that what they 
were doing was sufficient to provide high quality regulation. However, experience from OECD countries suggests that the development of Better Regulation 
is not a 'one shot' policy but is one which needs continuing monitoring and usually needs to go 
through a number of iterations to make it successful. Even in NMS where there is a policy in 
place, it will require continuous effort to maintain it. Impact Assessments Need to be Undertaken in Substance as well as in Form All NMS, except Malta and Cyprus, have laws requiring the undertaking of regulatory impact 
assessment (RIA) as part of new regulatory policy development. However, inadequate institutional arrangements, particularly as regards the quality review of 
assessments, lack of clear methodologies and training meant that the process became an empty 
formula and RIA existed in name and not in substance. These problems are being, or have been, addressed (Estonia, Czech Republic, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia). In these countries progress is being 
made to improve institutional support for RIA, to develop effective methodologies and train 
officials. Efficiency, as well as Legal Effectiveness, is a Key Determinant of Good Quality 
Regulation The policy formulation and regulation drafting process in all NMS is inevitably influenced by 
cultural, legal and administrative traditions and practices. There is no doubt that legal certainty is 
an essential part of regulatory effectiveness. However, experience from OECD studies suggests 
that not only do regulations have to be legally effective but they must also be efficient. 
Regulations need to be complied with easily or enforced and they must operate without 
unintended consequences. To achieve these ends, a purely legalistic approach to regulation 
making is not enough. There must be a multidisciplinary approach to the formulation of policy and 
the drafting of legislation and recognition of the need to put appropriate structures in place. The administrative structures in all NMS focus on legal effectiveness. Many laws are enacted in 
the NMS without sufficient attention being paid to how they will work in practice and how they will 
be applied. Progress is being made in this area but it is uneven and may not be sustained. Parliaments Need to Pay Attention also to Better Regulation Issues Effective regulatory regimes need effective parliamentary supervision. Many Parliaments in the 
NMS have developed good research capacities but have not yet engaged fully with the potential 
improvements to regulatory quality that can be brought about by the use of Better Regulation 
policies. In most NMS there is some evidence being shown by officials in the executive branch of 
government in improving regulatory management capacity through Better Regulation. However, 
this interest is not being matched in the NMS by the legislative branch of governments. 
Suggestions made in particular Sigma reports given to the NMS included the idea that there 
should be an annual debate in parliaments on Better Regulation issues. Enforcement Policy Needs More Consideration All NMS claim to have a 'zero tolerance' approach to enforcement, but capacity challenges limit 
this approach. Given the importance of this issue to European integration, more attention needs 
to be paid by NMS to developing a more realistic approach to enforcement, such as the 
development of a risk-based policy or a policy that imposes fees for inspections. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 17 2. 
ORIGINS OF EUROPEAN UNION POLICY ON BETTER REGULATION What are the Origins of Better Regulation? Better Regulation derives from a concern by governments to keep the cost of government to a 
minimum and to ensure that regulation is efficient as well as legally effective. It derives also from 
a concern that regulatory costs should not exceed benefits conferred by legislation. The roots of 
Better Regulation can be traced to regulatory reforms in the United States, which were aimed at 
reducing the size of government and the interference by government in the market. A range of regulatory reforms and deregulation activity first in the United States of America and 
then in other countries led to better functioning markets, according to OECD reports. However, 
regulatory reform and deregulation led, in many cases, to an increase in regulation. This was 
because when state-run monopolies existed there was no need for rules on market entry and 
exit. However, when the state moved out of areas such as telecommunications and other utilities, 
rules had to be introduced to ensure equity in markets and the number of regulations increased. 
In the United States, concerns about too much regulation and bad regulation were met with 
policies to improve the quality of legislation, including the use of impact assessment. In the United Kingdom, a White Paper in 1985 Lifting the Burden addressed concerns about the 
burden of legislation on small business. Other European countries developed similar policies. 
The Institutions of the European Union began to develop a Better Regulation policy in the same 
period. Similar developments took place in other Member States of the EU, notably, the 
Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Some countries, such as France, undertook similar 
reforms in the context of modernisation of their public services. Ireland adopted a policy entitled 
Regulating Better. OECD and Regulatory Reform The OECD has studied over 23 countries from the point of view of regulatory reform and 
observed that countries that performed better economically paid attention to the quality of the 
management of their regulatory processes. In the OECD studies, three stages of reform are 
visible. In the first phase, classified as Deregulation, what takes place is the elimination of 
regulations that impede competition and trade, and the reduction of a number of regulations. The 
process also includes the reduction of the burden on business and cost of regulations as well as 
the simplification of procedures and the streamlining of the administration. All of the countries 
studied fall into this category though the degree to which all reforms have been completed vary in 
degree between and within those countries. In the second phase of the development of this subject, classified as Regulatory Reform, there is 
an effort made to produce high quality regulations by improved policy-making processes which 
make use of tools such as impact assessment, better consultation and more effective planning of 
regulatory arrangements. This stage may also involve the updating and review and 
modernisation (i.e., coherence with political objectives in the areas of economy, environment and 
social standards) of existing regulations. All of the countries studied fall into this category though 
the degree to which all reforms have been completed vary in degree between and within those 
countries GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 18 Finally, the third phase of reform is classified by the OECD as regulatory management, which is 
concerned with long-term, systematic perspectives concerned with improved institutions and 
regulatory performance. None of the countries have reached this phase fully. A key development in thinking, contributed by the OECD, was the adoption in 1995 of the 
Recommendation of the Council of the OECD on Improving the Quality of Government 
Regulation 7 . This recommendation set out the first internationally accepted set of principles on 
ensuring regulatory quality. It included the 10 point OECD Reference Check List for Regulatory 
Decision Making. In a seminal report From Interventionism to Regulatory Governance 8 , the 
OECD identified three key drivers for regulatory effectiveness. These were regulatory policies 
(i.e., policies to improve the regulatory process), regulatory tools and regulatory institutions. The 
OECD Regulatory Reform Programme, which has involved a series of studies of regulatory 
reforms in OECD member countries, is aimed at helping governments improve regulatory quality. 
Its focus concentrated on reforming regulations that raise unnecessary obstacles to competition, 
innovation and growth, while ensuring that regulations efficiently serve important social goals. Policy on Better Regulation (European Union) An initial step towards improving the regulatory environment in the Institutions of the EU was 
taken when the European Union Institutions adopted the drafting guidance recommendations 
contained in the Inter-Institutional Agreement of December 1998. The purpose of this was to 
improve the quality of draft legislation 9 . The Edinburgh European Council of 1992 made the task 
of simplifying and improving the regulatory environment one the Community's main priorities. 
However, it was not until the mid-nineties that the search for better quality regulation became 
systematic. Better Regulation is also referred to in a protocol attached to the Treaty of 
Amsterdam. The issue was further addressed in the context of efforts to counter the relatively poor economic 
growth performance of many Member States – an issue of recurring concern to European policy 
makers. To address the concern, the Heads of State and Governments of the European Union 
met in Lisbon in 2000 and launched a series of ambitious reforms at national and European level 
as part of an overall strategy. By establishing an effective internal market, by boosting research 
and innovation and by improving education, to name only a few reform efforts, they aimed to 
address the challenges posed to the European Union by the impact of demographic change and 
globalisation. The development of Better Regulation in the European Union accelerated further with the EU 
White Paper on Governance. The White Paper suggests that there are links between good 
governance and the drive for Better Regulation. Mandelkern Group Report One of the practical measures taken to deliver this policy was the establishment of a group, 
representative of Member States, under the Chairmanship of a judge of the Council of State in 
France, Mr. D. Mandelkern 10 , to examine ways in which policy-making and regulation drafting 
could be improved in the Institutions of the EU. The group reported in November 2001 and 
produced a blueprint for Better Regulation in the European Union. The report was met with 
universal acclaim and its recommendations were largely adopted by the EU Institutions. 7 OECD/GD/ 95(95) OECD, Paris (1995). 8 OECD Paris, [PUMA(2002)3]. 9 Declaration 39 on the quality of the drafting of Community legislation, annexed to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty, 
1997. 10 http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/mandelkern.pdf. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 19 The Group drew from many sources, including reports on regulatory reform in almost 20 OECD 
countries 11 . The conclusions of the Group were, essentially, that to achieve Better Regulation, 
there is a need for high level and cross-government political support, the allocation of appropriate 
resources and an explicit Better Regulation policy. That policy should use tools such as: impact 
assessment, simplification, and consultation; it should promote a change in culture in the 
formulation of policy and the drafting of regulations. The report argued that Better Regulation is a drive to improve the policy-making process through 
the integrated use of effective tools and not an attempt to impose additional bureaucratic 
burdens. The report proposed an Action Plan, which was closely followed by the EU Institutions, 
and set out 7 core principles for Better Regulation. These principles are: necessity, 
proportionality, subsidiarity, transparency, accountability, accessibility and simplicity. The Mandelkern Group report was followed by the European Commission with a Communication 
in 2002, introducing a new integrated impact assessment system, roadmaps, instruments which 
provide an alternative approach to legislation (e.g., co-regulation, self-regulation), minimum 
standards for consultation of interested parties and guidelines for gathering and using expert 
advice 12 . Renewal of the Lisbon Process Progress has been made on each of these fronts by the Institutions of the European Union and, 
with the renewal of the Lisbon strategy in 2005, emphasis was put on the development of Better 
Regulation policy in the Member States of the European Union. Having reached the half-way 
stage of the Lisbon process started in 2005, the Commission decided to re-launch the strategy 
with a focus on growth and jobs and a streamlined process to enhance Member States' 
ownership of their reform programmes. The implementation of Better Regulation policy is central 
to the efforts to enhance productivity in the context of the Lisbon Strategy. The European Union 
on its own, however, cannot boost productivity and employment. Member States also must play 
their part through, for example, developing and implementing Better Regulation policy and using 
Better Regulation tools effectively. Member States are expected to recognise that action at EU level alone will not be enough to 
achieve Better Regulation. The transposition by the Member States of EU legislation and national 
regulatory initiatives have consequences, not just for national administrations and for citizens but 
also for businesses, particularly SMEs, from across the Union. The development and 
implementation of Better Regulation policy is, therefore, a priority to be addressed in the context 
of implementing the Lisbon strategy. The importance of Better Regulation is mirrored in the 
Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs 13 , where it is provided that Member States are 
recommended:  " To create a more competitive business environment and encourage private initiative through 
Better Regulation, Member States should: 1. 
Reduce the administrative burden that bears upon 
enterprises, particularly on SMEs and start-ups; 11 http://www.oecd.org. 12 European Commission, Action plan –  " Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment " , COM (2002) 278 final,

Improve the quality of existing and new regulations, while 
preserving their objectives, through a systematic and 
rigorous assessment of their economic, social (including 
health) and environmental impacts, while considering and 
making progress in measurement of the administrative 
burden associated with regulation, as well as the impact on 
competitiveness, including in relation to enforcement; 3. 
Encourage enterprises in developing their corporate social 
responsibility. "  As agreed at the European Council in March 2005, Member States are committed to drawing up 
under their own responsibility, National Reform Programmes (NRP) based on the Integrated 
Guidelines for Growth and Jobs which encompass the economic, social and environmental 
dimensions. The reform programmes should be geared to their own needs and specific situation, 
allowing for the diversity of situations and policy priorities at national level. NRPs should be 
conceived as forward-looking political documents setting out their 3 year strategy to deliver 
growth and jobs. These programmes, together with their implementation reports, allow the 
Commission to assess the policies and progress identified by Member States. The Commission has done so in its last two Annual Progress Reports from January and 
December 2006. In the latter one, the Commission issued country-specific recommendations and 
pointed out that reforms begin to deliver benefits. At the same time, it emphasized that reforms 
are at an early stage and will need to be fully followed through to make a lasting economic 
impact. Development of EU Better Regulation Policy To assure the success of Better Regulation and to strengthen these initiatives, the Commission 
presented in June 2002, a series of measures in the field of Better Regulation 14 . A further Communication in 2003 15 was aimed at streamlining and simplifying the regulatory 
environment by reducing the volume of existing European Union legislation and presenting the 
acquis communautaire in a more 'user-friendly' way. In December 2004, the Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs of six Member States (Ireland, 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, the UK and Austria and Finland) signed a letter aimed at lending new 
impetus to the process of Better Regulation. The Six Presidencies' Joint Statement followed and built on the earlier Four Presidencies' Joint 
Initiative of January 2004, setting out the Presidencies' objectives for regulatory reform in the 
coming years. In March 2005, the Commission adopted a new Communication 'Better Regulation for Growth 
and Jobs in the European Union'. While ensuring coherence with the ongoing action for Better 
Regulation and in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy, the Communication proposed 
three key action lines: @BULLET 
By further promoting the design and application of Better Regulation tools at the EU 
level, notably in so far as impact assessments and simplification are concerned. 
@BULLET 
By working more closely with Member States to ensure that Better Regulation principles 
are applied consistently throughout the EU by all regulators. Action at EU level alone will 14 COM (2002)278 final, ibid. 15 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social

regulatory initiatives have consequences as well, not just on national administrations 
and on citizens but also on businesses, particularly SMEs, from across the Union. 
@BULLET 
By reinforcing the constructive dialogue between all regulators at the EU and national 
levels and with stakeholders. In line with that Communication the European Commission 16 has: @BULLET 
Endorsed revised impact assessment guidelines 17 ; 
@BULLET 
Adopted a Communication on a common methodology for assessing administrative 
costs imposed by legislation 18 ; 
@BULLET 
Adopted a Communication on the outcome of a screening of pending legislative 
proposals 19 ; 
@BULLET 
Adopted a Communication on a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory 
environment 20 ; 
@BULLET 
Launched the group of high-level national regulatory experts 21 . The Communication outlines the purpose of the European Union's Better Regulation policy: "The European Union's Better Regulation policy aims to improve regulation, to better design 
regulation so as to increase the benefits for citizens, and to reinforce the respect and 
effectiveness of the rules, and to minimise economic costs—in line with the European Union's 
proportionality and subsidiarity principles" 22 . Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the EU 23 On 14 November 2006, the European Commission presented the results of a wide-ranging 
Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the EU. The review assesses the progress to date and 
makes an ambitious set of proposals. One of the initiatives concerns the launch of an ambitious strategy to reduce the administrative 
burden of existing regulation. The European Commission put forward a proposal to cut, jointly, 
with Member States, the administrative burden for companies by 25% by 2012. This, it is argued, could lead to an increase of an estimated 1.5 % in EU GDP and subsequently 
more investment for growth and new jobs, amounting to €150 billion. To achieve this target, 
Member States and regional and local authorities must also give a new political momentum to 
their own efforts to cut red tape. In March 2007, the Spring European Council underlined that reducing administrative burdens 
is an important measure for boosting Europe's economy, especially through its impact on SMEs, 16 [COM(2005)97 final], http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0097en01.pdf. See also reports from

df. 21 The mandate of the group is to advise the Commission on Better Regulation issues in general and to provide an efficient 
interface between the Commission and key government authorities for the development of better regulation at EU and 
national levels. 22 See page 2 [COM (2005) 97 final], ibid. 23 COM (2006) 689, http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/regulation/better_regulation/docs/en_689.pdf. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 22 and that a strong joint effort is needed. It therefore agreed that administrative burdens arising 
from EU legislation should be reduced by 25% by 2012. It also invited Member States, taking into 
account their different starting points and traditions, to set their own national targets of 
comparable ambition within their spheres of competence by 2008. Also, the system for impact assessment of all major new proposals for legislation will be 
improved to ensure quality and objectivity through the establishment of an Impact Assessment 
Board. Furthermore, 43 new initiatives have been added to the simplification rolling programme 
covering the period 2006-2009. These arise in a broad spectrum of policy areas. On 17.03.2006, the Commission confirmed its intention to withdraw 67 24 proposals as an 
outcome of the screening of 183 proposals for EU laws pending at the European Parliament and 
Council. The list of withdrawn proposals was published in the Official Journal 25 . These proposals 
were withdrawn because some were inconsistent with the objectives of the new "Partnership for 
Growth and Jobs" or did not meet better regulation standards. Others were not advancing in the 
legislative process, or were simply outdated. The 2006 screening exercise examined 79 pending proposals adopted by the Commission 
between 1.1.2004 and 21.11.2004, using the same criteria. Final results were announced in the 
Strategic Review Communication. The Commission informed Parliament and Council as 
required, providing a justification for withdrawal for ten proposals in total26. As a reasonable time 
elapsed without any reactions from their part, the list of withdrawals was published in the official 
journal of 22.03.2007. 24 Proposal 2003/0160/AVC included among those 68 originally selected for withdrawal has since been adopted by the 
Legislator and has, therefore, been removed. 25 OJ C 64 of 17.03.2006. 26 Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005 on relations between the EP and the Commission (paragraph 32). GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 23 3. 
REGULATORY MANAGEMENT This section examines regulatory management in the NMS. Regulatory management is the process whereby problems facing a country are selected for 
policy analysis, decision and drafting into legislation. The decision to formulate policy and draft 
legislation is taken by government or a minister, if delegated to do so. The focus in this Chapter, 
therefore, is on regulatory management process. Introduction In some countries and in the institutions of the European Union, the principles underpinning 
regulatory management are expressed in an explicit policy document designed to bring about 
improvements in policy formulation and the drafting, enactment and enforcement of legislation. The basic indicators for a regulatory management policy include: @BULLET 
A policy on Better Regulation 
@BULLET 
Strategy for action and a process for prioritisation 
@BULLET 
Coherent and consistent process to formulate policy and draft legislation 
@BULLET 
Quality assurance 
@BULLET 
An appropriate number of suitably qualified personnel. Policy on Better Regulation Explicit Better Regulation Policy During the assessments of the NMS, a number of NMS began to develop an explicit policy on 
Better Regulation. These included Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Slovenia. In some countries, 
between the time of the initiation of the project and the completion of particular country reports, 
the governments concerned had set up reform programmes that explicitly refer to Better 
Regulation within the context of the Lisbon strategy. In the Czech Republic, the government has developed, and at the time of the report was 
improving, a policy which equates broadly to the Better Regulation policy of the EU. A 
Government Resolution 27 was adopted on Reducing the Administrative Burden on Businesses. It 
includes an Action Plan for Reducing Administrative Burden on Businesses as well as for the 
Methodology of Measurement of Administrative Burden, based on the Dutch Standard Cost 
Model 28 . Poland developed an impressive programme that reflects a wide range of influences. The 
priorities for its Better Regulation reform programme are: @BULLET 
Identification and implementation of legislative solutions for simplification of domestic 
regulation and that of the acquis communautaire. 27 No. 421/2005. 28 See also the Standard Cost Model Manual pages 6 and 7 www.administratievelasten.nl/default.asp? GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 24 @BULLET

Strengthening the regulatory management capacities of government. Implicit Better Regulation Policy In Hungary and the Slovak Republic, a Better Regulation policy may be seen from a study of 
governance practices. Some Better Regulation tools are in place. The policy sets out the manner 
in which policies are formulated and legislation is drafted and is primarily set out respectively in 
the Organizational Order of the Slovak Republic Government Office and in the 1987 Legislation 
Act in Hungary. In Lithuania, the Strategy for Public Administration Development 29 stated that priority will be 
given to areas and activities mentioned in the Medium Term Programme 2004-2005, adopted by 
EU Ministers of Public Administration. One of the areas mentioned is Better Regulation. The 
Action Plan for Implementation of the Strategy for year 2005-2006 30 contains the actions 
designed to simplify decision making procedures. There have been further developments in 
Lithuania since the completion of the assessment and an explicit Better Regulation policy was 
being developed at the time of the writing of this report. In Latvia, Better Regulation is mentioned in the National Development plan 2007-2013 as a 
priority area 31 . In other countries, there is an implicit reference to Better Regulation policy in many aspects of the 
management of government activities. All NMS participate in Better Regulation expert groups. These include the High Level Group on 
Better Regulation established by the European Commission 32 , the Directors of Better 
Regulation 33 and, where appropriate, the OECD Working Party on regulatory management. 
Some countries, Poland, for example, have participated in benchmarking exercises in order to 
exchange practices and benefit from the experience of OECD or EU member countries that have 
already established a Better Regulation policy. Many of the countries studied (the Czech 
Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Poland) are members of the Standard Cost 
Model Network: steering committee 34 . Political Support for Better Regulation One of the factors critical to the success of Better Regulation is political support. This factor is 
mentioned frequently in OECD reports 35 and political support for Better Regulation in the 
Institutions of the European Union is, frequently, underpinned by speeches from Commissioners 
and senior officials and is now extending to more specific areas of policy such as a move to 
simplify the Common Agricultural Policy 36 . 29 2004 – 2010, approved by Government of Lithuania, Resolution No. 488 (Official Gazette 2004, No. 69-2399). 30 Resolution No. 197 (Official Gazette 2005, No. 26-830). 31 Following the terminology used in Latvia until 2006, Better Regulation activities were designated under the term 'impact 
assessment'. 32 Commission Decision of 28 February 2006 setting up a group of high Level National regulatory Experts (2006/210/EU). 33 Group of National experts undertaking work on Better Regulation in each Member State meet twice a year to exchange 
information. 34 See footnotes 107 and 108. 35 See in particular OECD (1997), Regulatory Impact Analysis. Best Practice in OECD Countries, Paris; Taking Stock of 
Regulatory Reform, 2005. 36 See .europa.eu/agriculture/simplification/index_en.htm and for papers from a conference on the subject. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 25 Responsibility for Better Regulation policy is conferred on different ministers in different 
countries. The table below provides a representative cross section of how responsibility for Better 
Regulation is spread in the NMS. NMS 
Ministry Cyprus

Slovak Republic 
Ministry for the Economy 
Slovenia 
Ministry for Public Administration The problem, put succinctly by one political figure in the Slovak Republic, is that the outcomes 
from Better Regulation are too abstract to deliver clear political kudos. On the other hand, 
regulatory failures are clearly visible. If a minister takes responsibility for Better Regulation and if 
things go wrong he will get blamed. If things go well there will be no shortage of candidates to 
claim the success as theirs. Government Programmes and Similar Documents Specific political support for Better Regulation-type policies may also be found in government 
declarations or national reform programmes. These tend to be formulas. Without express dates 
for delivery or defined outcomes, their value is questionable. The National Reform Programme of the Republic of Cyprus laid down priorities for the 
implementation of a regulatory management reform. In that case, priority was attached within that 
programme to the development of a policy on impact assessment and the reduction of the 
regulatory and administrative burden. In Estonia, the 2003 Coalition Agreement mentioned regulatory impact assessment and 
proposed that the impact of each draft regulation on economic growth and the demographic 
situation should be assessed. Another priority mentioned in that Agreement was the proposed 
policy to simplify business start-up rules and the necessity to review regulations that restrict 
business activity unecessarily. The current coalition agreement in Estonia refers to the need to 
simplify the procedures related to dealings with local authorities by businesses. In the Czech Republic, the commitments made to implement the Better Regulation agenda, 
relating in particular to the integrated impact assessments and the reduction of the administrative 
burden imposed on businesses, were renewed in the National Reform Programme of the Czech 
Republic (2005-2008) and in the Strategy for Economic Growth of the Czech Republic. 37 In the Czech Republic, responsibility for Better Regulation was transferred from the Government Office to the Ministry of 
Interior following a Government decision of October 2006. 38 However, besides the Ministry of Justice, other ministries are involved. 39 The implementation of the Better Regulation policy in Latvia remains with the State Chancellery. However, other ministries, 
including the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy are also involved. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 26 In Hungary, the 2006 programme for Government: New Hungary – Freedom and Solidarity: the 
Programme of the Government of Hungary for a Successful, Modern and Just Hungary (2006 – 
2010) 40 commits Hungary to progress and recognises the growing number of small and medium 
sized enterprises and the need to simplify a number of laws to facilitate competitiveness of small 
businesses. In Latvia, the Government Declaration, an important national policy statement, includes a 
commitment to improving competitiveness 41 and identifies a number of policy issues 
characteristic of a Better Regulation policy. These include, in particular,  " simplification of decision 
making "  relating to small businesses 42 . In Malta, a general outline of a Better Regulation policy is set out in the 'National Reform 
Programme: Malta's strategy for growth and jobs for the period 2005 to 2008' 43 . In addition, the 
2006-2010 Pre-Budget Document refers also to regulatory reform and to the necessity to reduce 
regulatory burden on business. In the Slovak Republic, support for the implementation of Better Regulation policy may be found 
in the National Reform Programme of the Slovak Republic (2006 – 2008) and in the document 
The Strategy of Competitiveness in Slovakia by 2010 – the National Lisbon Strategy, which 
presents four top priorities of the Slovak government, one of them being increasing the quality of 
the business environment. Structures to Implement a Better Regulation Policy (NMS) Better Regulation policy is most likely to be effective when there is a structure to implement it. 
Three main approaches to the development of structures to implement Better Regulation policy 
may be seen; a task force, a person or a central coordinating body or a combination of these 
approaches. Task Force In Cyprus a group representative of a wide range of ministries and interests has been appointed 
to develop a policy on impact assessment and determine what other aspects of a Better 
Regulation policy can be developed. In Poland an inter-ministerial working group (the Task 
Force for Modern Economic Regulation) was established in February 2006 to develop the policy 
so as to enable it to be submitted for Council of Ministers approval. This Task Force will build on 
the work done by the team appointed in 2000 (the Inter-ministerial Regulatory Quality Team) and 
will deal with similar issues, but with a stronger focus on both improving the regulatory 
environment for business, and making use of the regulatory tools more effectively. In Slovenia, 
an inter-ministerial working group was established to develop and manage a Better Regulation 
policy. Person or a Central Coordinating Body In Estonia, responsibility for Better Regulation policy is spread across the Ministry for the 
Economy, Ministry for Justice, Ministry for Social Affairs and Ministry for the Environment. 
However, one official is primarily responsible for receiving and disseminating information about 
Better Regulation policy. She attends international meetings on Better Regulation issues and 
ensures that information on international developments is passed on to the rest of the public 
service. 40 www.miniszterelnok.hu/domain2/ files/modules/module15/1461461FB7EDBA8C3.pdf. 41 Declaration of the Council of Ministers 1 December 2004. The Declaration is the basis for Government work: see later in the 
text. 42 Declaration of the Council of Ministers 1 December 2004; www.mk.gov.lv. 43 Paragraph 14.3. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 27 In the Czech Republic, a Better Regulation Unit was established within the Department for 
Central State Reform and Regulatory Reform of the Government Office. It has, since November 
2006, been moved to the Ministry for the Interior. It is responsible for coordinating Regulatory 
Reform across the state administration as well as the preparation of strategy papers in this area. In Hungary, an independent Department was established in the Ministry of Justice, called the 
Department of Impact Analysis, Deregulation and Registration of Law, to provide professional 
support for quality legislation and improve the quality of impact assessment. However, this Unit 
was abolished in July 2006 as part of the cut backs in the size of the public sector. Its functions 
were partially transferred to another part of the Ministry for Justice. In Latvia, the Policy Coordination Department of the State Chancellery is responsible for 
designing and implementing the policy and strategic planning system, which includes the Better 
Regulation policy. The latter are prepared in cooperation with line ministries, which are in charge 
of checking the quality of impact assessment, according to their respective areas of competence. In Malta, Better Regulation is the responsibility of the Better Regulation Unit within the 
Management Efficiency Unit (MEU). The MEU operates in the Office of the Prime Minister and 
plays a unique role of an in-house management consultant to the Government. It has developed 
some experience of impact assessment. The Better Regulation Unit established in December 
2005 in Malta forms part of the MEU and is, therefore, part of the Office of the Prime Minister. 
The mandate of the Unit is to monitor regulatory developments and reduce unnecessary 
bureaucracy. A Combination of These Approaches In Poland, an inter-ministerial working group (the Task Force for Modern Economic Regulation) 
was established in February 2006 to develop the Better Regulation policy so as to enable it to be 
submitted for Council of Ministers approval. There is also a strong, well managed Department in 
the Ministry for the Economy and added competencies were given to the Office of the Prime 
Minister to oversee impact assessments. It is also proposed to appoint an official in each 
ministry, with responsibility for Better Regulation. The Polish model reflects the need to have coordination mechanisms in place and the need is 
recognised to share responsibilities for implementing the Better Regulation policy with line 
ministries in order to create a sense of ownership of Better Regulation amongst all civil servants. Strategy for Action and a Process for Prioritisation Government consists of institutions responsible for formulating policies and taking collective 
decisions for society. These decisions may be taken in accordance with a fixed, centrally 
controlled plan, a flexible, strategic plan or decisions can be made ad hoc without any planning 
reacting to circumstances as they arise. All NMS operate with a mix of these arrangements. 
Governments, usually, come into office with a plan which is a version of manifestos compromised 
to fit in with a coalition partner's needs. Government plans, or strategies to identify problems for action, need to be underpinned by three 
main elements: a clear set of policy priorities, planning procedures and institutions involved in 
planning co-ordination and dispute resolution process when there are conflicts to be resolved. 
The latter is of most importance when there are coalitions. Policy Priorities In all NMS, the implementation of EU law is considered to be the highest priority. The next level 
of priority is Government programmes. Lithuania is unique in that a strategy is decided for the 
country that stays in place regardless of the political parties in power. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 28 In Latvia, the overarching strategies are set out in the Government Declaration and the Single 
Strategy of National Economy. In the Slovak Republic, the overall strategic plan for policy activities is set out in the Slovak 
Government Programme Proclamation. This type of approach is broadly similar for all countries. Planning Process A well-structured policy planning process is an essential part of regulatory management. It 
ensures that government strategy for collective action is implemented. Prorities may be identified, 
initially, by government on the basis of political programmes or may result from an administrative 
planning procedure. Overarching policy documents exist in all NMS, though the approach to 
compilation varies and the extent to which they are adhered to is dependent on factors such as 
party discipline within government. In Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic party discipline is weak and planning is less 
effective. Alternative policy proposals arise frequently in Bills and amendments, which move the 
national agenda away from its overall plan. In these countries Bills, or amendments to 
government Bills, can be proposed even by members of the same party as the government. This 
increases the unpredictability of legislation and distorts the planning process. In the Czech Republic, planning priorities are identified following two processes. A Government 
Policy Statement is prepared on the basis of a list of strategic priorities for the forthcoming 4-year 
legislature, reflecting priorities selected by each ministry for areas of competence. In addition, the 
Annual Plan of Legislative Actions of the Government and the Annual Plan of Non-Legislative 
Actions of the Government are prepared by the Government Office, on the basis of the 
Government Policy Statement, and are approved by the Government each year. In Slovenia, a 
similar process is followed that separates out the strategic plans from the more tactical, biennial 
budget plan and the annual legislative plan. In Hungary, policy priorities are, mostly, determined on the basis of the government programme 
(generated from party programmes) or as a consequence of day – to – day issues arising. In 
addition, each ministry has a programme which sets out with greater particularity its approach to 
the implementation of the Government programme. There is also a six-monthly legislation list 
which sets out the legislative programme of the government. In Hungary, in practice, a dynamic 
political system throws up issues regularly not foreseen in any plans and as much as 50% of the 
legislative output arises from proposals not set out in the Government programme. In Lithuania, these plans include long-term (more than 7 years), medium-term (3 to 7 years) and 
short-term (1 to 3 years) planning. It operates from bottom to top and from top to bottom. The 
long-term State Development Strategy is at the top of the pyramid of the different planning 
documents and serves as the basis for development of sectoral strategies for three to seven 
years. Vice versa, sectoral strategies can lead to changes in the long-term State Development 
Strategy. When preparing their three-year strategic plans, ministries and other public institutions take into 
account the objectives set out in sectoral strategies. The Action Plan to implement the 
Government Programme adopted by a newly appointed government, within 3 months of the 
approval of the Government Programme, outlines specific Government actions to be taken within 
a four-year period following its publication. The strength of the planning process lies in the fact 
that, irrespective of the Government in power, there is a continuity of strategy as regards national 
goals, including regulatory management goals. There is a high level of transparency at every 
level of the planning process, from the macro plan for the Government as a whole to the micro 
plans in Departments within ministries which also have plans to give effect to the objectives of 
these ministries. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 29 In Malta 44 , proposals arise from consultation with departments, agencies and commissions, and 
priorities are determined on a case by case basis, depending on the importance and urgency of 
the matter. In the Slovak Republic, strategic planning for policy activities is set out in the Slovak 
Government Programme Proclamation, as a macro tool, and in the Plan for Legislative Tasks of 
the Government, as a micro tool. However, a sizeable number of legislative proposals is based 
on proposals originating outside government. These may even include proposals made by 
members of the political party in Government. An Effective Structure to Coordinate Policy Planning The efficiency of a policy planning system is strengthened whenever a body or ministry is 
entrusted with policy planning coordination, but coordination at the centre of government needs 
to be effective. In Cyprus, responsibility for the planning of strategic and developmental policy activity is vested 
in the Cyprus Planning Bureau. Planning of other policy initiatives rests with individual ministries. 
The Planning Bureau was established following a decision of the Council of Ministers and placed 
under the Minister of Finance. In cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, it is responsible for the 
5-year strategic plans laying out all the development projects and coordinates the planning 
procedures for the country. In Latvia, the planning of Government actions, at the time of the Sigma review, was managed by 
the Policy Coordination Department of the State Chancellery. In Lithuania, government priorities are usually set in March along with the budget formation 
process. When developing cross-cutting policies to implement priorities, all the necessary policy 
documents have to be discussed with interested parties and institutions. The majority of strategic 
documents are discussed by the Government Strategic Planning Committee, before their 
approval by the Government. It is a platform for policy review as well as a suitable format to 
negotiate and solve contentious issues and coordinate priorities. Procedures to Resolve Conflicts Between Priorities A clear strategy to identify problems for collective action and a process for prioritisation by means 
of policy or regulatory intervention is necessary to ensure a smooth regulatory management. The deciding factor for resolution of political priority conflict is often the extent to which the 
proposals must be within budgetary limits. For example, in Cyprus, priority is given to policies 
which are budgeted for in the annual budget. In Hungary, the Ministry of Finance has emerged 
as a dominant ministerial Department, since the far reaching reforms in the system of public 
budgeting that took place in Hungary in the 1990s. In Latvia, medium term government priorities 
are established by a Government decision. In Malta, differences of opinion between ministries on 
priorities, or on the allocation of resources, are resolved bilaterally or in consultation with the 
Ministry for Finance. In all NMS, conflicts that can not be resolved at ministerial level in relation to planning and 
prioritising of policy issues are submitted to meetings of the government (Council of Ministers) for 
resolution. The ultimate authority to arbitrate and resolve disputes varies in accordance with the 
constitutional structure of the country concerned. This function is performed by the President of 
the Republic (Cyprus) or the Prime Minister (Lithuania). In all NMS, the relevant authority, 44 Malta has three overarching policy documents: 'A Better Quality of Life: 2006-2010 Pre-Budget Document' and the 'National 
Reform Programme: Malta's Strategy for Growth and Jobs for the period 2005 to 2008 – Public C Consultation Document' 
and the 'National Strategic Reference' which was drafted to address issues related to the distribution of 'Objective One' 
Structural Funds. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 30 President or Prime Minister, receives regular reports on progress and oversees the development 
and implementation of plans. In the Czech Republic, the government represents the most important coordination mechanism 
at the level of the central state administration. If a settlement on a particular issue cannot be 
achieved at a lower level, it is raised to the level of deputy ministers and then presented to the 
Cabinet as an  " unsettled issue " , if any disagreement still remains. The latter shall decide such 
cases. In Hungary, in 2000, a new system of policy coordination, called the Referatura, was created in 
the Office of the Prime Minister. This special body, modelled on one existing in the German 
Chancellery, is composed of a group of experts who shadow each ministry's activities. Together 
with a lawyer from the Prime Minister's Office Legal Department, they prepare a joint note on all 
submissions. The joint note describes the proposal, the outcome of inter-ministerial 
consultations, unresolved issues, and proposals for improvement. In Latvia, key draft policy documents and draft regulations, for which a special working group has 
been set up 45 , are circulated to ministries before they are submitted to a weekly meeting of the 
State Secretaries (the highest ranking civil servants of all ministries). Following the Rules of 
Procedure of the Government, a summary of all ministry proposals, including arguments for 
accepting or rejecting each proposal is prepared, and accompanies the draft document when it is 
returned to the meeting of the State Secretaries and forwarded to the Government for approval. In addition to meetings of the Government in Lithuania, regular inter-ministerial meetings are 
used as an important structure to resolve conflicts between priorities before policy proposals are 
submitted to the government for a final decision. In Malta, inter-ministerial meetings at technical 
and political level are regularly held but there are no formalised procedures 46 . A similar procedure exists in Hungary, where the penultimate stage of the legislative process is a 
meeting of the Administrative State Secretaries. In this case policy documents are circulated to 
ministries before the State Secretaries' meeting if a special working group is set up to draft a 
policy document. Many coalition governments in Latvia have had an alternative body for deliberations, called the 
Coalition Council. It consists of equal representation of all parties represented in the governing 
coalition and under some governments it has acquired an unofficial, yet key, place in the 
decision-making process. The Coalition Council can be used as a place to resolve politically 
sensitive issues, and to reach decisions, which are then officially adopted in the Cabinet of 
Ministers' meetings. The issues discussed at the Coalition Council are draft policy proposals and 
draft legislation already consulted at ministerial level. This alternative forum operates outside 
official channels, does not follow procedures set out for policy-making, and is not open to public 
scrutiny. In Poland, all draft legislation must be subjected to scrutiny within the permanent Cabinet 
Committee at the Secretary of State level before it is submitted to the Cabinet. 45 The word regulation is used here to include primary and secondary legislation. Policy documents for which no working group 
has been set up are circulated to ministries only after the State Secretaries' meeting. 46 At the Technical level there are: monthly meeting of Permanent Secretaries chaired by the Principal Permanent Secretary, 
weekly meeting of EU Affairs Directors. Other regular meetings: Forum for Corporate Services Directors (Human resources, 
finance), Forum for Policy Development Directors, Forum for Programme Implementation Directors, ICT Forum. Discussions 
held within these fora are reported to the Permanent Secretaries. 
At the political level, there is a: weekly meeting of the Cabinet on the basis of Cabinet papers circulated beforehand, weekly 
meeting of the Prime Minister, Permanent Secretaries for Finance and the Principal Permanent Secretary. Monthly meeting of 
Cabinet Committee support units: there is one cabinet committee for each key sector (environment, tourism, capital projects, 
competitiveness). The Prime Minister chairs these Committees, which gather key ministries, e.g., the Principal Permanent 
Secretary, Cabinet Secretaries and some stakeholders. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 31 In the Slovak Republic, differences of opinion between ministries, as regards draft legislation, 
are resolved by bilateral discussions or upon a meeting of the Directors General. Legislation can 
not be submitted to the Council of Ministers until these disputes are resolved. However, in the 
case of substantial comments, the conflict may be resolved by the Council of Ministers. A Transparent and Well-structured Process All of the NMS reviewed had a transparent and well-structured process for policy formulation and 
legislation drafting. They all have rules or systems in place to formulate policy, draft legislation 
and submit the outcome to government. All NMS have adopted a framework broadly similar to 
that recommended in the OECD Reference Checklist for Regulatory Decision Making 47 , namely, 
that the following questions should be asked when formulating policy: @BULLET 
Is the problem correctly defined? 
@BULLET 
Is government action justified? 
@BULLET 
Is regulation the best form of government action? 
@BULLET 
Is there a legal basis for regulation? 
@BULLET 
What is the appropriate level (or levels) of government for this action? 
@BULLET 
Does the benefit of the regulation justify the costs? 
@BULLET 
Is the distribution effect across society transparent? 
@BULLET 
Is the regulation clear, consistent, comprehensible and accessible to users? 
@BULLET 
Have all interested parties had the opportunity to present their views? 
@BULLET 
How will compliance be achieved? The decision to develop a policy may be taken by government or an individual minister. The 
nature of the decision (government or ministerial decision) depends on the size and complexity of 
the problem to solve and the extent of resources required. In the case of the former, government 
decisions are, usually, preceded by a process that includes consultation within and across 
ministries. In the case of secondary legislation, the process is simpler and inter-ministerial 
consultation is, usually, not necessary. However, in Malta proposals for secondary legislation must be notified and approved of by the 
Office of the Prime Minister. This approach avoids ministers making regulations that are in 
conflict with the policies of the government as a whole or the making of regulations that conflict 
with regulations made by other ministers. In Cyprus, secondary legislation is subject to a more 
detailed review in the parliament than is usual in any other NMS. Iterative Sequence In all NMS, the policy formulation process begins with a decision in principle, at a political level, 
to initiate the policy development cycle. The decision may originate from any one of a number of 
sources. Policy sources are similar in all countries, though the mix varies. Policies may derive 
from government manifestoes, coalition agreements, court cases, short-term emergencies, 
international obligations. Following the decision, in principle, to initiate the policy-making cycle, policy formulation follows a 
similar iterative sequence in all NMS. The official concerned with the policy, initially, conducts 
desk research on the problem and identifies if the problem has been dealt with domestically or 
internationally, and develops a solution, in consultation with colleagues within and across 47 OECD, Recommendations of the OECD on Improving the Quality of Government Regulation (Adopted 9 March 1995). See 
also OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance, endorsed by Council of OECD 28 April 2005, 
OCDE/GD/95(95). GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 32 ministries, and with interested stakeholders. In Slovenia, the Government Rules of Procedure 
require officials to make a comparative study of three other countries as part of this stage of the 
process. Distinction between Policy Formulation and Regulation Drafting The most striking difference between policy formulation and regulation drafting procedures in the 
NMS could usually be traced to whether the countries had been influenced by common law or 
civil law traditions. In addition, countries that had formerly fallen within the communist sphere of 
influence have also undergone significant modernisation of their structures and processes and 
even had experienced complete turnover of personnel. In some NMS, notably Estonia and 
Latvia, the levels of experience and institutional memory were considerably less than in others. 
However, in most NMS there is a limited number of officials with experience of legislative 
drafting. This problem is understood and is being addressed in Poland and Hungary, where 
there are some facilities for training officials to draft legislation. Other than the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, there is little formal distinction 
between policy formulation and regulation drafting. This is reasonable in the case of simple policy 
activities, as there is often little need to separate out the two processes. However, for substantial 
policy issues, it is generally regarded as useful to separate the policy formulation activity from law 
drafting. In practice, most knowledgeable people interviewed, in all of the NMS, were of the view 
that there should be some form of division of labour or, at the very least, a separation of the two 
tasks. In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, there is a very distinct division between the 
policy formulation stage of the process and the regulation drafting stage, in relation to the more 
significant policy issues. In the first instance, a decision in principle is taken by the government to 
proceed with a proposed policy and, when that decision has been taken, the drafting of 
legislation begins. None of the countries in this study has a central body dealing exclusively with law drafting. 48 This 
is not surprising in the civil law countries, where officials who formulate policy are also expected 
to be able to draft legislation. In some countries, for example, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, the legal 
department in a ministry is frequently expected to draft legislation for which a different official has 
formulated the policy. However, no general conclusion may be drawn from the variation in 
practice in any of these countries. The practice varies in accordance with the officials concerned 
and their familiarity with the subject matter of the policy to be legislated for and their capacity to 
draft legislation. Few NMS adopt a multidiciplinary approach to the preparation of legislation. In Estonia and 
Latvia regulations, especially when they rule on complex issues, are drafted in multidisciplinary 
working groups which may include representatives from outside experts and NGOs. The use of 
working groups is common to all NMS, particularly where the issue is complex and requires 
specific, technical knowledge which may not be available within the public sector but may be 
available in the private sector. Civil and Common Law Traditions: Procedural Rules and Customs In the civil law countries, the policy formulation and legislation drafting process is undertaken in 
accordance with a set of written rules. Some civil law countries, Estonia, for example, have 
constitutional requirements to identify the authorities entrusted to initiate laws. 48 For an analysis of the arguments for and against a central body see SIGMA (1997), Checklist on Law Drafting and Regulatory 
Management in Central and Eastern Europe, SIGMA Paper No. 15, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/21/1823473.pdf. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 33 Various rules in NMS prescribe how policies are to be prepared and presented to government 
and to parliament. There are some subject-specific general rules for the development of policies 
and drafting of regulations 49 . Special rules are laid down also for implementing certain types of 
strategy and action plans, e.g., in the energy sector, forestry and agriculture. In Hungary, the legislative procedure is regulated by the Constitution and the Legislation Act 
1987. Chapter two of that Act provides that proposals for new laws should be subject to 
preliminary studies and use clear language and that identical or similar issues should be 
regulated in the same laws. It also prescribes that citizens should participate in the formulation of 
legislation. A Government Decision relating to Governmental Procedures 50 prescribes, among 
other matters, the details of the intra-governmental consent mechanism and the content, required 
by law in Hungary, of any proposals to be submitted to government. Latvia has enacted an Administrative Procedure Law 51 which sets out general provisions for the 
functioning of the administration. The Rules of Procedure of Government 52 regulate the 
procedures of government. Policies must be drawn up in accordance with these rules which 
include, for example, the classification and structure of policy documents as well as the 
Procedure for Filling in Annotations of Draft Regulations 53 . The annotations are the explanatory 
materials that accompany a draft regulation sent to the Cabinet of Ministers and to the 
parliament. They include an assessment of the economic and social impacts of the draft 
regulation considered, as well as the impact it may have on the state budget. Similar materials in Lithuanian law are to be found in the Law on Government, which sets out 
how the government programme is to be implemented. There are also guidelines prepared by the 
Ministry of Justice, which specify the structure to be followed to present proposals for 
regulations 54 . Rules for inter-ministerial consultation and co-ordination are prescribed by the 
Government Rules of Procedure approved by a government resolution 55 . Paragraph 49 of the 
Rules on Consultation 'Requirements for legislation Drafting and Approval' contains a list of I 
nstitutions with which regulations have to be discussed prior to submission to government. In Poland, the procedure for the development of government draft primary legislation is set out in 
the Law on Organisation and Rules of Procedure of the Council of Ministers and in the Sphere of 
Competence of Ministers of 8 August 1996, together with its implementing regulations. Officials 
formulating policy and drafting legislation also need to have regard to the Principles of Legislative 
Technique set out in a regulation of the Ordinance of the Prime Minister on Principles of 
Legislative Techniques 56 . The Organisational Order of the Slovak Republic Government Office lays down basic principles 
for the overall management of state administration. Further details regarding the role of the 
Government Office in this regard are set out in the Statute of the Slovak Republic Government 
Office. However, the Slovak Republic is a special case as the division of labour between officials 49 For example, the Aarhus' Convention requires a Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment. 50 No. 1088/1994. 51 November 2001. 52 March 2002. 53 Council of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia, 18 September 2001. See also amendments July 12 2002 and June 11 2004. 54 Structure to be followed: there should be a legal basis for the law; there should be a proper legal evaluation of the proposal; 
there should be a reference to related laws and steps taken to avoid conflict with other laws or duplication of laws; there 
should be an explanation of why the law is needed; there should be a description of how the problem has been solved in 
other countries; there should be a reference to relevant E U or international laws, if any; the proposal should explain fully its 
purpose; the financial, economic and other impacts of the proposal should be assessed and referred to; reference should be 
made to the structure of the law when fully drafted; reference should be made to any other law to be amended. 55 No. 728 (OG 1994, No. 63-1238). 56 20 June 2002. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 34 who prepare policy papers and those who draft the legislation mirrors the procedure followed in 
countries with a common law tradition or which have been influenced by such tradition, where 
legislation is drafted by lawyers who have specific skills in drafting legislation. The Rules of Procedure of the Government of Slovenia and the Rules of Procedure of the 
Slovenian National Assembly regulate, respectively, the organisation of the government and the 
parliament. The former provide, among other matters, for the role of the Prime Minister, 
organisation of the work of government, working parties of government, government councils, 
format of government documents and the usual matters relating to the organisation of 
government. This pattern is followed in most of the civil law countries studied, though the terminology varies 
and a range of legislative titles covers this field, including Administrative Procedures Acts, Law 
on Government or Organisational Orders. In NMS which have been influenced by common law traditions, there are, usually, no 
standardised administrative procedures required by law to ensure that policy action takes place 
at the appropriate level of government. Much of the policy-making process is regulated by 
custom or by procedures developed by ministries. In Cyprus and Malta, the operation of the policy formulation and legislation drafting process is a 
matter of custom, or circulars issued for internal use, rather than something which is regulated by 
rules of law or procedure, as is the case in the civil law world. Quality Assurance — Institutions Experience in OECD countries suggests that good regulatory management requires a quality 
assurance process that validates the flow of proposed regulations against good regulatory 
principles. Regulatory management should also address the stock of regulations. This is a 
particularly important issue for all NMS, due to the pace and pattern of the implementation of the 
acquis communautaire. It can not be assumed that unnecessary regulatory burdens have not 
been imposed or that all new laws enacted post-independence are a perfect match with 
regulations that were already in place. Officials in all of the NMS acknowledge that the acquis 
was adopted at a very high speed and that a period of review and reflection is needed so as to 
confirm that the acquis has been adopted effectively. It is arguable that a quality assurance process needs to function horizontally, as regards the 
implementation of an overarching policy on regulatory management and vertically, within each 
body responsible for making regulations. The quality assurance process may be generalised for 
the flow of regulations and may be generalised for the stock of regulations or may be undertaken 
in particular sectors. There are two main models of quality review in the NMS. The first is where quality review is 
undertaken by a series of reviews within ministries, and across ministries, and sometimes with 
outside bodies. These include reviews by: @BULLET 
Office of the Prime Minister (however called). 
@BULLET 
Ministry of Justice. 
@BULLET 
Ministry of Finance. 
@BULLET 
Inter and intra-ministry reviews. 
@BULLET 
Courts. The second model is where reviews are undertaken by a specially designated committee or 
body. The former approach predominates and the latter tends to be confined to technical, legal 
issues. No NMS review the quality of legislation specifically to ascertain the extent to which the GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 35 flow of new legislation complies with Better Regulation principles. In all NMS, the bodies involved 
in regulation quality checking have very heavy work loads, which result in delays in the 
preparation of legislation. Review by the Office of the Prime Minister or other body at the centre of government Typically, the Office of the Prime Minister is involved from the point of view of the consistency of 
the proposals with government policy. The role varies in accordance with the extent to which the 
Prime Minister is a powerful figure in the system. In some NMS at the time of the Sigma review, 
for example, in Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia, the Prime Minister and the 
Prime Minister's Office were very powerful. In Hungary, a special unit composed of advisers, and established in February 2006 within the 
Office of the Prime Minister, is responsible for summarising the opinions expressed on 
regulations proposed by the government during the technical, policy reconciliation process. This 
is designed to filter out problems relating to the quality of, or the necessity for, the proposed 
legislation. Inadequately prepared proposals are rejected at this stage. In Latvia, the State Chancellery plays a very central role in a number of ways, notably in 
reviewing draft laws to ensure their conformity with strategic plans, political priorities and legal 
technicalities. In addition, it controls the quality of legislation through the 'Annotations' process. 
The State Chancellery is the body responsible for enforcing procedures and rules as regards 
policy-making and strategic planning. Proposals not completed in accordance with the law are 
sent back to ministries and are not dealt with until they are in the proper form. In Lithuania, the Office of Government plays an important role in the quality assurance process. 
These tasks are shared in the Chancellery by a number of directorates, including the Strategic 
Planning Directorate, the European Directorate and the Legal Directorate. The review by the Office of Government ensures conformity with national plans and strategies. 
The Office of Government, Legal Division, also reviews drafts from the point of view of legality 
and legal technicalities. The Legal section, however, has the advantage that it is represented at 
the weekly meeting of the State Secretaries which reviews proposals before they are finally 
submitted to Government. This gives the Legal Section the influence, if not the power, to block a 
proposal if, potentially, it could give rise to legal problems. Ministry of Justice In all NMS except Cyprus, the Ministry of Justice is involved from the point of view of 
constitutional and legal issues. In Estonia, for example, the Ministry of Justice is the ministry 
responsible for legal quality at the start of the drafting process. Once the concept of a draft law is 
approved by the Ministry of Justice it may be drafted into legislation. The Legal Chancellor also 
has a role in the quality assurance process. In Hungary, the Ministry of Justice has a role in Better Regulation issues though this was 
reduced during the assessment process. In 2005, a special unit was established in the Ministry 
(Department of Impact Analysis, Deregulation and Registration of Law). That Unit was to be 
responsible for assuring the quality of impact assessments; however, it was abolished in July 
2006. In Latvia, the Ministry of Justice reviews drafts from the point of view of legal technicalities, 
consistency with the Constitution, with the general principles of law and with existing regulations 
and conformity with strategic plans, with political priorities and with norms of international law. 
This responsibility includes also a review of drafts to ensure compliance with European norms. 
The State Chancellery, together with the Ministry of Justice, ensures clarity and coherence of 
drafts. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 36 Review by the Ministry of Finance In all NMS, the Ministry of Finance reviews drafts from the point of view of budgetary issues so 
as to ensure that the proposals are within budgetary limits. For example, in Cyprus draft laws 
submitted to the Council of Ministers must be accompanied by a written opinion of the Ministry of 
Finance, except in cases where there is no connection with budgetary issues. The Constitution 
provides that every bill submitted to Parliament must be accompanied by a report called "Objects 
and Reasons" signed by the Attorney – General of the Republic. Inter and Intra-ministry Reviews In some NMS, legal departments within each ministry have a role in reviewing the quality of 
legislation drafted within the ministry and in other ministries. In Hungary, the Legal Department of a given ministry is obliged to ensure that the regulation 
produced by the ministry is compatible with the legal system and rulings of the Constitutional 
Court. In addition, within a ministry there are Operational Rules designed to ensure consistency 
within a ministry. The inter-ministerial cross-review, for example, in the Czech Republic, 
Hungary and in the Slovak Republic is a form of quality review. In theory, the ultimate review of 
quality is undertaken by the government (Council of Ministers) when it examines draft legislation. In Estonia, the circulation of drafts is organised by an electronic system called e-law (e-õigus), 
administered by the Ministry of Justice. The system enables a comprehensive circulation of all 
relevant materials and a straightforward process of commenting on drafts. From the moment that 
the ministry has prepared a concept of a draft law, it is inserted into the electronic coordination 
system and sent to the Ministry of Justice, electronically, through that system for approval. Later 
in the process, when a draft law needs the approval of line ministries, the draft, the explanatory 
letter and any annexes may be inserted into the electronic coordination system, which 
automatically sends a message to the ministry which is required to send its opinion on the draft. 
From this moment, all relevant documents may be consulted by the public. 57 In Latvia the interministerial consultation process is organized by the electronic circulation of 
documents using the government web page. From the moment of the 'annoncement' of a draft in 
the Meeting of State Secretaries, each draft and annotations of Bills and other legal instruments 
are made available for public consultation. Ministries now only use the electronic form of 
documents in the process of analysing and giving opinions on proposed drafts. Government 
meetings are also organised around the electronic circulation of documents (e-portfolio). A similar system is to be introduced in Slovenia with an editorial function similar to a spell check 
which will enable officials to verify style usages. In Poland, the Permanent Cabinet Committee (KRM) may delay the consideration of proposed 
draft legislation by asking the department to remedy formal defects, such as the absence of the 
list of differences, EU compatibility assessment, and public consultations. If these problems are 
not addressed within 14 days, the secretary has the authority to stop the document from being 
considered at the KRM. Role of Courts In all NMS, the Constitution provides for a mechanism ensuring the constitutionality of laws, 
through the establishment of a Supreme Court or Constitutional Court. It examines the 
Constitutionality or compatibility of the law with international treaties and European law. Its 
decisions of a policy nature are taken into consideration and policies and legislation adapted 
accordingly. 57 This also contrasts with the secrecy and formality that surrounds this type of process in older democracies. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 37 In Cyprus, a problem arose which resulted in the Supreme Court declaring unconstitutional a 
legal provision introduced while implementing a Directive. This problem has now been solved by 
law 127 (I) of 2006 which has amended the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, so as to 
establish the supremacy of the acquis communautaire over the constitutional provisions. An unresolved issue in Hungary, in relation to the role of the Supreme Court is its jurisdiction as 
regards the control of the transposition of directives into the Hungarian legal system. In Hungary, the Constitutional Court plays a very active role in the quality review of regulations. 
Decisions of the Court have a significant effect on the content of regulation in that officials 
drafting legislation need to take into account decisions of the Constitutional Court. Its quality 
control role has evolved since its creation. During the first 8-9 years, the primary task was to 
facilitate the transition from one legal regime to another. In the second phase of the development 
of the court, the two main areas of activity were: the constitutional control of proposed legislation 
and the supervision of the operations of state organs, from a constitutional point of view. The Hungarian Constitutional Court also issued rulings supporting the use of Better Regulation 
tools, contributing, indirectly, to strengthening the quality check of legislation. It has been asked 
to consider the consequences of a failure to consult on a piece of legislation. The case 
concerned environment legislation which included a compulsory statutory requirement to consult. 
The consultation did not take place and the Constitutional Court was called on to determine 
whether a regulation made without the necessary consultation taking place might be declared 
unconstitutional 58 . The court held that the failure to consult with the Environmental Council, in 
accordance with the law, invalidated the law made without the proper consultation process being 
followed. However, in another case, the Court ruled that for Acts of the National Assembly, the 
failure by the government to consult a particular group did not invalidate the law. Specialist Bodies Responsible for Quality Review In some countries, there are designated bodies to review draft laws from the point of view of 
consistency of a draft with the Constitution and the general principles of law. In Cyprus, by virtue of the Constitution, the Attorney General of the Republic is the legal adviser 
of the Government. All drafts of proposed legislation must be seen by the Attorney General 
before they are submitted to the Council of Ministers. All draft legislation must pass through the 
Office of the Attorney General. In some cases, this results in redrafts by that Office to assure the 
legality and constitutionality. In the Czech Republic, the quality review process is assured by the Legislation Council of the 
Government (LCG) which reviews the legal aspects of the draft. Some criteria are laid down in 
the Legislative Rules of Government. These ensure that attention is given to the quality of the 
legal text and to matters such as organisation, clarity and comprehensibility of the drafts. The LCG is an independent committee, consisting of civil servants, independent experts and 
academics, chaired by the minister responsible for legislation. The Council is divided into several 
working groups, each responsible for a respective area of public, private or criminal law. It is 
supported by a permanent Secretariat called the Government Legislation Office, which is a part 
of the Government Office. In Malta, the Attorney General has a role similar to that of the Chief Law Officer in Cyprus and 
reviews all drafts of primary and secondary legislation from the point of view of constitutionality 
and consistency with the general principles of law. Once drafted, legislation must be referred to 
the Office of the Attorney General for review and to be translated into Maltese before submission 58 Resolution No. 30/2000. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 38 to Government (primary legislation) or signature by a Minister (secondary legislation). All 
legislation is drafted in Maltese and English. In case of conflict, the Maltese version prevails. In Poland, there are two bodies concerned with legislative quality: the Government Legislation 
Centre (GLC) and the Legislative Council. The GLC was originally established within the 
Chancellery of the Prime Minister but it was made into an independent body in 2000 59 . It is, 
nevertheless, answerable to the Prime Minister. The GLC coordinates the government's legislative activity, provides legal advice to government, 
prepares government drafts and advises on parliament's drafts 60 . Its head participates in the 
meetings of the Standing Committee of the Council of Ministers and his office is consulted on a 
day-to-day basis by the Socio-Economic Affairs Division, Department of the Prime Minister's 
Chancellery 61 . The Legislative Council is the senior legal advisory body to the Prime Minister 62 . It advises on the 
enactment of draft primary and secondary legislation and evaluates the condition of the law, 
particularly in terms of alignment with the Constitution and EU law. Evaluation reports are 
regularly issued 63 . However, in practice, the Legislative Council may be consulted by the Cabinet 
Committee and the Cabinet only if a collective decision is taken to that effect 64 . Approximately 
60% of the draft Bills are submitted to it but its opinion does not bind the department. In the Slovak Republic, after the inter-ministerial amendment procedure, Bills are submitted to 
the Legislative Council of the Government, which is a constituent part of the Office of the Prime 
Minister. It addresses technical, legal issues, such as lack of conformity with the Constitution and 
reviews drafts to improve their quality. The Secretariat of the Legislative Council drafts an opinion 
on each Bill, which is prepared following discussion with the official in the Ministry responsible for 
the Bill. In addition, from time to time, there is a two-day meeting, where the Legislative Council reviews 
its work and the Chairman meets with officials who are involved in the process of drafting 
legislation, and the Secretariat of the Council, to identify ways in which legislative drafting can be 
improved. Close attention is also paid to the conformity of laws with the Constitution and the 
general principles of law. The Institute for Approximation of Law screens the compatibility of Bills 
with EU law. In Slovenia, all legislation must be submitted for review by the Government Office for Legislation 
to examine it in terms of its conformity with the Constitution, general principles of Slovenian law, 
the acquis communautaire, and its compliance with the style of Slovenian legislation. Quality Assurance – Tools In most countries, explanatory reports must be submitted to the reviewing bodies and the 
parliament in order to enable them to carry out their quality assurance role. As a result, in some 
countries, draft regulations may be returned to the drafting ministries where the information 
provided by the supporting documents is not sufficient (Latvia, Slovenia). The reports may be described differently in the various countries: policy documents, annotations, 
covering letters, law concept papers, explanatory reports, and legal check lists. However, the 59 OECD (2002), Reviews of Regulatory Reform, Poland – From transition to new regulatory challenges. 60 OECD (2002), ibid. 61 Goetz K.H., Zubek R. (2005), Law making in Poland: rules and patterns of legislation, Report commissioned by Ernst & 
Young Poland within the framework of the Ernst & Young Better Government Programme, April 2005. 62 K.H. Goetz, R. Zubek, ibid. 63 OECD (2002), ibid. 64 K.H. Goetz, R. Zubek, ibid. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 39 content of these reports is, in general in the NMS, quite similar and they usually include 
information such as the justification, scope of the proposal and the certification that it complies 
with EU law. Some reports may contain an assessment of the various impacts that the draft 
regulation may have, including, very often, the financial impacts (Latvia, Slovak Republic, and 
Slovenia). In theory, in all countries except Cyprus and Malta all proposals submitted to 
government should be accompanied by an impact assessment but in practice the quality of these 
varies substantially. In some countries, the requirement to support a draft regulation with an explanatory note does 
not apply to all legislation. In Malta, the legal check list must be filled in only for secondary 
legislation. In addition, some specific check lists or reports may be required in the case of primary 
or secondary regulations transposing EU directives (Cyprus and Lithuania). In countries where policy-making and regulation drafting are clearly separated, there may be two 
kinds of report, one policy paper and one explanatory report, as is the case in Estonia and 
Latvia. However, in most countries, a single document accompanies the draft law from the 
drafting stage to its presentation before the parliament. Material required for the information of the Attorney General in Cyprus The work undertaken in the Office of the Attorney General is facilitated by it getting good 
instructions to draft or clear instructions as to what issues need attention. Its task is made easier 
by the requirement that officials sending to it draft legislation must always send with the drafts 
sufficient information to enable it to perform its functions effectively. This information includes: ► Adequate information on the history of the problem, a detailed explanation of the 
legislative proposal aimed to rectify (e.g., discussions that have taken place, ad hoc 
committee proposals, judicial decisions etc.). ► The main goal(s) of the legislative proposal, with a report on the necessity for any 
possible reservations or transitional clauses. ► The means with which the main goals of the legislation shall be accomplished (e.g., the 
mechanisms anticipated to come into force, competencies and powers deemed 
necessary to grant, etc.). ► All known difficulties and ramifications (legal, social, administrative) that could possibly 
be caused by the legislation, as well as the expected costs of its application publicly 
and/or privately. Model Law Concept and Explanatory Letter in Estonia In Estonia, two documents are submitted at different stages of the rule making process to the 
reviewing bodies. The Law Concept Paper is drafted at the stage of initiation of policy and the 
explanatory letter is circulated at the stage when the legislation is drafted. At an early stage in the policy formulation process, a ministry proposing to introduce new 
legislation must send the broad outline of the proposal, in the form of a Law Concept Paper, to 
the Ministry of Justice for approval of the proposal in principle. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 40 Model law concept and explanatory letter (Estonia) The Law Concept Paper is based on a circular letter sent to all ministries indicating that draft 
regulations for consideration by government should set out: 
1) 
Description of the situation of the area. 
2) 
Purpose of the proposed regulations. 
3) 
Potential means to achieve the policy goals. 
4) 
The scope of the law. 
5) 
Impacts of the proposed regulations. 
6) 
Financing. 
7) 
Presumable time limit for preparing the draft law and the name and contacts of the 
official responsible as well as the name and contacts of the official who has some legal 
expertise. 
In addition, a draft law must be accompanied by an explanatory letter. 
The government regulation on technical rules also deals with the structure of the explanatory 
letter of a draft law and requires that the explanatory letter shall include the following parts: 
1) 
Introduction. 
2) 
Purpose of the draft. 
3) 
Content and comparative analysis of the draft. 
4) 
Terminology of the draft law. 
5) 
Conformity of the draft to the law of the European Union, effects of the regulation. 
6) 
Expenses necessary for the implementation of the regulation, implementation acts of the 
regulation, enforcement of the draft. Annotations in Latvia In Latvia, draft laws and draft regulations which have a socio-economic impact or an impact on 
the environment or on the state budget must be accompanied by a document called 'annotation' 
which summarises the impacts they may have. The annotation ensures that drafts submitted to 
the State Secretaries' meeting and, ultimately, to government are supported by research and 
policy analysis. A description of the annotation process is set out in the box below. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 41 Annotations (Latvia) Annotations are required by law and drafts submitted without the required degree of annotation 
may be returned to the ministry by the State Chancellery for revision. Participants in the State 
Secretaries' meeting may also request that an annotation be prepared for a draft law in case 
there is none. 
The purpose of the annotation is to ensure evaluation of the socio-economic impact and fiscal 
impact on the state budget and on the budgets of local governments of proposed policies or 
regulations and to prevent adoption of conflicting regulatory enactments. 
The annotation sets out: 
► The current situation and a description of the problem to be solved 
► A description of the main socio-economic indicators 
► Current legal regulations and necessary amendments 
► Reference to Government Declaration or a policy document authorising or requiring 
proposal 
► Purpose of proposal and brief summary of it 
► Medium-term financial impact assessment 
► Reference to the EU legal instruments and international agreements 
► Communication with NGO`s relevant social partners 
► Institutional arrangements for the implementation of the draft regulation 
A properly completed annotation should show an analysis of the impact on the development of 
society and national economy, indicating possible changes in macroeconomic environment, 
business environment and simplification of administrative procedures, social and environmental 
situation and an analysis of the impact of the proposal on the observation of human rights and on 
opportunities for men and women. 
More specifically, the impact must be assessed on a range of factors, including: 
► The volume of the production of goods and services 
► The employment rate 
► The unemployment rate 
► Prices 
► Volume of exports 
► Competition. Legal Check List in Malta A legal notice check list has been in force since 2004. It applies, however, only to secondary 
legislation. The function of the check list is to ensure that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are 
informed about what secondary legislation is made and why it is needed. The check list covers 
the following areas: @BULLET 
General aspects (proposed legal notice title and Act in virtue of which it is being issued; 
objectives, scope and compelling reasons for publication). 
@BULLET 
Drafting exercise (whether consultation with stakeholders and a regulatory impact 
assessment were carried out). 
@BULLET 
Impact (impact on the private sector – envisaged new or increased burdens and 
procedural or administrative impacts; impact on government – bearing on other 
Ministries and entities and whether proposals impact on government priorities and 
mainstreaming policies). GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 42 @BULLET 
Outcomes (positive and negative outcomes; mitigation measures in case of negative 
outcome). 
@BULLET 
Deadline for publication. Explanatory Statement in Poland Bills should be accompanied, when submitted to government and to parliament, with an 
explanatory statement which must indicate, amongst other matters, the estimate of its social, 
economic and financial effects, sources of finance, a statement of whether the Bill proposes to 
impose a burden on the State Budget, and a declaration about the compliance of the Bill with the 
law of the European Union. Bills presented by the Council of Ministers should be accompanied 
by proposals of basic secondary legislation. Following the Legislative Rules of the Government of the Slovak Republic and the 
Methodological Instructions, draft Bills must be accompanied by: @BULLET 
A cover report containing a general justification for the legislation, the draft government 
resolution, the draft resolution of the parliament, the actual draft regulation; 
@BULLET 
An explanatory report containing a justification for each section of the draft, details on 
the compatibility of the law with the Constitution, other laws, international treaties; as far 
as EC legislation is concerned, the report shall contain a specific clause explicitly 
certifying the compatibility of the draft law with the law of the European Union; an 
evaluation of the inter-ministerial comment procedure and the evaluation of the financial, 
economic, environmental and social impacts of the draft law. Explanatory Letter in Slovenia The Rules of Procedure of the Government of Slovenia 65 require that all primary legislation be 
accompanied by a covering letter which includes: @BULLET 
Data referring to identification and procedure for the consideration of the government 
document. 
@BULLET 
Government decision proposal. If amendments to an implementing regulation are 
proposed, the document shall include a proposal for the adoption of government 
decision on determining the consolidated text. 
@BULLET 
Assurance of the proposer that the impact assessment of proposed government 
decisions was carried out and that required inter-ministerial coordination and 
consultation with the representatives of civil society was held; the impact assessment 
shall be carried out in the area of public finance, compliance with the acquis, removal of 
administrative barriers, as well as in the area of public administration, judiciary, 
economy, environment and social situation of individuals. The proposer shall be 
accountable for the accuracy of the part of the assurance under their competence. 
@BULLET 
The explanation of proposed decisions, including the explanation of effects of the 
proposed measures and other data required for the quality decision-making of the 
government, which shall be set by the Government Secretary General. 
@BULLET 
All elements prescribed by the National Assembly of Slovenia Rules of Procedure if the 
draft is submitted to the National Assembly. The Secretariat General issued an instruction 66 including in Annex a form which is to be filled in 
by officials when drafting regulations and refers to all the elements of the explanatory report that 
needs to accompany a draft text according to the Rules of Procedure. 65 Article 8. 66 Instruction No. 10 for implementing the provisions of Rules of Procedure of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 43 Specific Check List and Table for Transposing EU Legislation in Cyprus, Lithuania 
and Malta In Lithuania, a table of concordance, provided with each draft to give effect to an EC Directive, 
shows the derivation from the Article of the Directive and the destination to the article in the draft 
legislation. This table also provides a degree of transparency which is of value to those who have 
to interpret the legislation and to the European Commission who ensure that Member States 
comply with their obligations. In Cyprus, the laws transposing EC Directives follow the same path as ordinary laws. However, 
the explanatory report sent to the Council of Ministers, together with these transposing laws as 
well as their drafting procedures, differs to some extent from the one sent for ordinary laws. The report that accompanies a Bill to parliament is presented in accordance with a structured 
questionnaire about the purpose of the transposition. This document includes a specific checklist 
drafted by the Office of the Attorney General before the accession period and which the relevant 
department is required to fill in on the basis of guidance issued by the Ministry of Finance. Check list that must accompany Bills submitted to Parliament (Cyprus) The checklist mentions the following elements: 
► Purpose – scope of new legislation 
► Reference – analysis of certain EU legislation 
► Timely commitments for adoption 
► Possibilities of derogation/acquis 
► Easiness/flexibility for any transitional arrangements 
► Competitive reference to existing legislation in Cyprus and to which extent affected by 
new legislation 
► Capacity of the country to implement the provision re: staff mechanisms 
► Economic evaluation of the expected effect on citizens — organisation or other interests 
of the country (general, economic, social or other of the proposed legislation) 
► Reference to meetings organised 
► Contacts with organizations — people interested 
► Direct course of implementation in the long-term 
In addition, in the case of EC Directives, a timetable is also filled by the relevant department in 
order to ensure a timely transposition; this mentions the following elements: 
► Legislation title 
► Relevant EC Directive 
► Transposition period 
► Department responsible 
► Date of completion of drafting 
► Legal vetting: date of submission – date of completion 
► Council of Ministers: date of submission – date of approval, date of signature by the 
Minister (for Orders) 
► Parliament: date of submission — date of approval 
► Date of sending to the government — printing off 
► Reference of publication In Malta, in addition to the check list prepared for use by Ministries in preparing secondary 
legislation, the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) has drawn up a check list for 
drafting secondary legislation implementing EU directives. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 44 In accordance with the MEPA Guide, a transposition team is set up for each new item of 
legislation, comprising the policy officials, MEPA's legal advisor, MEPA's EU Coordinator and 
technical specialists from other agencies, as required. The team must then draw up a 
transposition plan, laying down the timing and resources required in order to transpose the 
legislation properly and on time. The project plan should identify who is involved in this process. 
It sets out the objectives of the transposition and a precise time schedule for internal and public 
consultation, as well as for post-consultation evaluation. It should also determine what risks and 
difficulty may need to be faced during the process of transposition. Appropriate Number of Suitably Trained Personnel There is no rule on the ideal number of suitably trained personnel. The efficiency of a given 
system may depend on the qualifications, experience and attitude of the officials and the way 
they are managed. There are many variables in levels of ability, education and systems and 
exact quantitative comparisons are difficult if not impossible. In many countries, personnel with the level of competence to formulate policy and draft 
legislation may be in demand in the private sector and are not inclined to stay in the public 
sector. This was noticable, particularly, in Latvia and the Slovak Republic. In most NMS, the 
lack of skilled people available to draft legislation was mentioned by officials interviewed. In Cyprus, the Office of the Attorney General has a staff of 80 [lawyers and support staff]. 
Ministries do not have a separate legal service but most of the people working in ministries have 
a legal background. However, the levels of staffing in that Office were set to be improved. In the Czech Republic, the Legislative Council of the Government (LCG) is an independent 
committee, consisting of civil servants, independent experts and academics, chaired by the 
minister responsible for legislation. It is composed of some 25 members. Working groups 
(namely for public law, private law and criminal law) are composed of 10 to 15 people who are 
not full-time civil servants. The Members of the LCG are appointed at the discretion of the 
government and should be eminent and well-respected public or private sector lawyers and not 
actively involved in party politics. In Hungary, at the Ministry of Justice, there are around 67 250 lawyers and, typically, two officials 
are in charge of a draft regulation: one prepares the draft and the other supervises. However, 
there are only 10 officials in the Law Department of the Ministry of Economy and Transport. This 
number was reduced by 50% on the basis that there was no need for jurists in the ministry, and 
the ministry's legal affairs issues could be contracted out to lawyers. In Lithuania, the Legal Department of the Office of Government employs 9 lawyers to review all 
proposals to government. Although 3 have over 15 years experience, this seems to be a light 
capacity considering that only 4 days (7 for substantial proposals) are allowed to examine 
legislative proposals, which suggests that either this requirement is interpreted flexibly or the staff 
of the Office of the Government has a very heavy work load. In Poland, the Government Legislation Centre employs 100 lawyers. Most of these lawyers have 
at least a three-year drafting experience within a line ministry. However, the Legislative Council 
is made up of 10 eminent lawyers, who perform their tasks within the Council, in addition to other 
professional activities. Recently, as its membership was renewed, the staff of the Legislative 
Council was reduced. In its recent composition, it has no support staff to assist its members. In the Slovak Republic, for example, there is a Legislative Council composed of 18 members, 
each chosen by the Chairman of the Council on the basis of their expertise across a wide range 67 The word 'around' was used in response to questions at interviews and is to reflect that, from time to time, officials are absent 
for vacation, maternity leave and other reasons. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 45 of legislative subjects. Members of the Council are not remunerated and continue to undertake 
professional responsibilities in their respective fields. The Council is supported by a full-time 
Secretariat, composed of 15 lawyers and some additional support staff. The Legislative Council 
works under considerable time pressures and has to examine a substantial volume of legislation. Some NMS (Latvia) have engaged in a process to increase staff numbers in this regard and to 
reform the civil service so as to introduce more flexibility in departments responsible for law 
drafting. In Estonia, experts from other ministries or non-governmental bodies may be invited to 
participate in the drafting process. The system demonstrates a high degree of flexibility which 
helps compensate for weak capacity relative to larger public services. There is a list of experts 
with a description of their competencies 68 , which enables working groups for impact assessments 
to source knowledgeable experts. In Malta, the Office of the Attorney General has a small number of lawyers, some of whom are 
primarily engaged in reviewing and redrafting legislation. More staff are being recruited to that 
Office and it is to be established as an agency to provide more flexibility as regards recruitment 
and remuneration. 40 lawyers were working at the Ministry of Justice at the time of writing the 
report, only two to three people were responsible for reviewing all legislation and one person was 
responsible for translation. Need for Training in Drafting In most countries, officials responsible for drafting do not receive specific training in drafting. In 
the common law world, it is said that it takes between 5 and 10 years to train a legislative drafter. 
In the civil law world, all officials are expected, as part of their day-to-day duties, to be able to 
draft legislation within their field of substantive competence. The activity is largely one of aptitude 
and some individuals possess more of a gift for this type of activity than others. Even in the 
common law world, with its elaborate network of professional drafting offices there is only a 
limited number of institutions providing training in the subject. In all the NMS, efforts are being made to up-skill the public service. In Estonia 69 , the Legal 
Terminology Committee has its own periodic publication. It contains articles on using language in 
legal texts, on legal terminology, on translating legal texts as well as concrete proposals on how 
to word certain rules. Although proposals of the Legal Terminology Committee are not 
compulsory to law drafters, as they have no legal power, they are quite often considered. Work has begun in Cyprus on providing courses in legislative drafting for officials. In Latvia, law 
drafting study courses are included in the curriculum of the law faculty of one university. The 
School of Public Administration provides courses on impact assessment, policy-making and 
strategic planning. In addition, the Legal Terminology Committee organises workshops and 
seminars for law drafters to explain different linguistic questions. Hungary and Poland have developed formal training in legislative drafting. In most NMS, drafts 
are handled by officials, in accordance with their level of experience. The theory is that 
experienced officials can draft at the level needed to produce high quality drafts. In many NMS, 
however, the age profile of officials is very young. This is particularly striking in Estonia and 
Latvia, where there has been a large influx of young people into the public service and an official 
with 5 years experience would be regarded as very experienced. 68 For example, the list identifies officials by training: biologists, human geographers, engineers, economists, sociologits, 
lawyers, public administration managers, etc. 69 The publication  " Õiguskeel "  (Legal language) is published five times a year. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 46 The lack of experience of the staff involved in drafting may be compensated for by the availability 
of rules for drafting (Estonia) or by the publication of written criteria against which draft 
regulations must be reviewed (Latvia). It would require a very detailed study to examine the 
quality of legislative drafting in each Member State, taking account of linguistic differences and 
different judicial approaches to legislation. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 47 4. 
BETTER REGULATION TOOLS IN NMS This section describes the tools used in NMS. Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), 
Consultation, Alternatives, Simplification, and Accessibility. It examines them from the point of 
view of why they are used, how they are used (methodologies), who uses them (institutional 
arrangements, where appropriate) and when they are used, in the NMS. Impact Assessment — General Impact assessment 70 aims to facilitate the choice of the most efficient and effective regulatory 
option by establishing a systematic and consistent framework for assessing the potential impacts 
of government action. It ensures the formulation of evidence-based policies, while providing the 
information necessary to make better regulatory decisions. Impact assessment also improves 
transparency and accelerates culture change. There is no single model for a good impact assessment programme. When designing an impact 
assessment programme, it is necessary to take into account institutional, social, cultural and 
legal contexts in the relevant country. An OECD study identified a number of good practices in 
member countries which maximise the benefits to be gained from implementing an impact 
assessment programme 71 . Impact assessment needs to be reviewed by a central body to ensure consistency across, and 
within, ministries. The central body should add value by ensuring that ministries do not use 
impact assessment to justify decisions taken and by facilitating dialogue between ministries and 
resolving 'turf' disputes between ministries. Impact assessment may be considered from two perspectives: as a tool to improve policy-making 
and as specific methodology used to assess the impacts of given regulations. Impact 
assessment should be part of an overall strategy on Better Regulation, as proposed in the 
Mandelkern report 72 . Three common problems were identified by the Mandelkern report as 
regards the implementation of a RIA policy. These are: practical difficulties, cultural resistance 
and political pressures. The practical difficulties can be overcome by awareness raising through 70 Usually referred to as regulatory impact assessment, or RIA, but more easily recognised as impact assessment. 71 RIA best practices in OECD countries: Maximize political commitment to RIA; Allocate responsibilities carefully for RIA 
programme elements; Train the regulators; Use a consistent but flexible analytical method; Develop and implement data 
collection strategies; Target RIA efforts; Integrate RIA with the policy making process, beginning as early as possible; 
Communicate the results; Involve the public extensively; Apply RIA to existing, as well as new, regulation. 72 The Mandelkern report suggested that there were 7 prerequisites for a successful RIA policy. These are worth repeating in 
full as they still constitute a good basis for making a combined use of Better Regulation tools: 񮽙 The RIA process needs to be an integral part of an overall strategy to improve the regulatory environment; 񮽙 There must be high level political support for the concept of RIA and its practical application; 񮽙 Preparation of a RIA should, wherever possible, be by the policy officials concerned and should start as soon as possible 
in the policy development process and continue as a fundamental part of it; 񮽙 The results of the assessment need to be informed by, and subject to, both informal and formal consultation with 
interested parties and others; 񮽙 This work is most effective when it is overseen by a specific structure dedicated to Better Regulation and is supported by 
clear advice guidelines and training; and 񮽙 Sufficient resources (in terms of quality and quantify) must be allocated to this structure. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 48 training, appointing an adequate number of staff and identifying good sources of data for policy 
analysis. The cultural and political challenges are closely related and both can be overcome by 
political commitment and embedding the use of the tool into day-to-day regulatory management. Three common mistakes should be avoided in designing an impact assessment system 73 . Impact 
assessment should not be used: @BULLET 
As an ex post justification of the policy proposal. 
@BULLET 
To create another bureaucracy. 
@BULLET 
To define problems to fit into existing structures (some problems cut across traditional 
ministerial boundaries and this fact needs to be recognised in the process). As far as the impact assessment methodology is concerned, consideration needs to be given as 
to which issues need to be prioritised for impact assessment and the choices for assessment 
include: economic impact, impact on the environment, impact on small businesses, and impact 
on the public service itself. Generally, the extent to which legislation may be enforced, or compliance with it secured, is not 
considered by governments in advance of introducing new legislation. However, in the 
Netherlands, the Table of Eleven developed by the Dutch administration is a tool for thinking 
about compliance, and for increasing the likelihood that regulations will be complied with through 
an ex ante compliance assessment. It takes eleven aspects of a proposed regulation, each of 
which will increase or decrease the likelihood of compliance. In considering how exactly to 
phrase the regulation, and how to enforce and publicise it, the Table of Eleven is useful in 
highlighting areas that are likely to reduce compliance, so that regulations can be made as 
self-enforcing as possible. Table of Eleven 
Developed in the Netherlands The eleven factors are 
► aspects of spontaneous compliance: 
knowledge of the regulation 
costs of compliance/benefits of non-compliance 
degree of business and popular acceptance of the 
regulation 
loyalty and natural obedience of the regulated form 
extent of informal monitoring 
► aspects of monitoring: 
probability of report through informal channels 
probability of inspection 
probability of detection 
probability of the inspector 
► aspects of sanctions 
chance of sanctions 
severity of sanctions A further step in the development of an effective impact assessment policy is to undertake a 
number of pilot impact assessment projects in some areas, selected on the basis of a screening 73 Many lessons have been learned over the last twenty years and are documented. Bibliography set out in Annex 5. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 49 mechanism. Decisions need to be taken as to whether the same process should be applied to all 
proposed policies or whether there should be a two-step approach of a broad brush stroke 
impact for all proposed policies and a more detailed one for policies that will involve a substantial 
impact. Ex post impact assessment The ex post assessments have much in common, in their approach, with the policy assessments 
made ex ante. Ex post assessments may involve a consultation process in order to receive 
feedback from stakeholders and make improvements, if necessary, to the legislation concerned. The European Commission Staff Working Paper on Impact Assessment and ex ante evaluation 74 
points out the need to set out ex ante and ex post evaluations. Few EU Member States have 
procedures for the regular evaluation of the operation and the effectiveness of existing laws. In 
some Member States 75 , ex post evaluations are carried out by scrutinising a random selection of 
legislation on a quarterly basis. Ex post evaluations are usually carried out when general reviews 
of existing legislation take place, for example in the context of the simplification programme. In 
other cases, the time when the ex post evaluation takes place may be decided on when the new 
regulation is being prepared and can, in appropriate circumstances, be included in the legal text. Typical questions addressed in ex post evaluation ► Have the original objectives been achieved in quality, quantity and time, when measured 
against the base of what would have happened without intervention? 
► To what extent has the intervention brought about the achievement of the objectives or 
has it induced activity that would not otherwise have occurred? 
► Has implementation been affected, adversely or advantageously, by external factors? 
► Have any significant unexpected side effects resulted? 
► Have all the inputs required from the Government and the private sector been made as 
planned? 
► Have any of the allocated resources been wasted or misused? 
► How efficient was the administration of the scheme? 
► Has the scheme led to any unfairness or disadvantage to any sector of the community? 
► Could a more cost-effective approach have been used? 
► What improvements could be made to the scheme that might make it more effective or 
cost-efficient? 
► Overall is the scheme well-suited to meeting the desired objectives? Source: 
Preparation, Drafting and Management of Legislative Projects, by Professor Keith Patchett — 
Sigma January 2003. Why is Impact Assessment Important? Impact assessment is possibly the most novel of the tools in that its use brings to bear economic 
analysis and, used correctly, it may become a scientific driver for a more evidence-based 
approach to policy-making. Impact assessment aids good decision making and makes 
transparent the costs and benefits of different regulatory and non-regulatory options that may be 
suggested by ministries. However, impact assessment is not a substitute for political 
accountability. 74 COM(2005)119 final, http://ec.europa.eu/research/future/pdf/comm_sec_2005_0430_1_en.pdf. 75 E.g., the UK. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 50 Impact assessment is not a new tool. It became used in the Office of Management and Budget (a 
part of the Office of the President of the United States) in the nineteen seventies and has been 
adopted by many countries since. Impact assessment is, increasingly, seen by governments and 
the Institutions of the European Union to be an essential tool of governance. Conducting impact assessment may also contribute to improving compliance both ex ante, 
through the use of a compliance assessment, and ex post, since ex post assessments may help 
in identifying unanticipated regulatory effects with a view to amending regulations where their 
original goals are not met. Impact Assessment System in the EU The European Commission has introduced a new Impact Assessment system in 2003. This 
system is built partly on the experiences with its predecessor, the Business Impact Assessment 
(BIA). It was outlined in the Communication on Impact Assessment 76 , which was part of the 
Better Regulation Action Plan 77 . Impact assessment was further improved in 2005 78 . The new 
procedure aims to improve the quality of the Commission's policy proposals in terms of their 
efficiency, effectiveness and coherency. It identifies alternative policy options and their likely 
positive and negative impacts, with an equal focus placed on economic, environmental and social 
effects, in line with the EU Sustainable Development Strategy 79 . In March 2006, the 2005 Impact 
Assessment Guidelines were updated so that assessment of administrative costs is now a 
compulsory and integrated part of impact assessments. To reinforce quality control, the Commission announced in its Strategic Review Communication 80 
the creation of an Impact Assessment Board. It is composed of high level Commission officials 
from DGs ECFIN, ENV, EMPL and ENTR, chaired by the Deputy Secretary General. The Board 
acts independently of the policy-making departments and reports directly to the President of the 
Commission. It issues opinions on the quality of IAs. To assist its work the IAB may have 
recourse to external expertise. It commenced meetings in December 2006, and issues several 
opinions already. The Commission IA system as a whole was subjected to a comprehensive independent review 
by external consultants during 2006, and the final report was delivered to the Commission 
recently. It will be used to detect areas for improvement. Impact Assessment in NMS At the time of the assessments, Cyprus and Malta did not have a fully developed policy on 
impact assessment, though the matter was under active consideration in both. The necessity for 
impact assessment was understood and used in the context of environmental impact 
assessments in both countries and for some large-scale projects involving substantial sums of 
money. It was not in use as a tool to improve the quality of policy-making or the drafting of 
legislation. Cyprus established a task force to address the issue and the Better Regulation Unit 
in the Management Efficiency Unit in Malta began work which will lead to the introduction of 
impact assessment. All of the other NMS had adopted impact assessment in some form or another. However, a 
number of NMS (Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland and the Slovak Republic) had reached 76 COM(2002)276 final, ibid. 77 COM(2002)278 final, ibid. 78 European Commission (2005), New Impact Assessment Guidelines June 2005, SEC(2005)791, 
http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/SEC2005_791_IA%20guidelines_annexes.pdf. 79 COM(2001)264 final, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0264en01.pdf. 80 COM(2006) 689 final. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 51 the stage where they recognised that impact assessment existed in form, rather than in 
substance. In all NMS, other than Cyprus and Malta, impact assessment was required by law 
for proposals to be submitted to government. Legal Basis In the Czech Republic, the Government Rules of Procedure (GRP) 81 impose a requirement that 
all policy proposals should include an analysis of the impacts on the business environment and 
the impact on equal treatment of men and women. Similar legal arrangements are in place in 
Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. In the absence of a central 
control on their quality, these arrangements are generally ignored. In Estonia impact assessments were obligatory for all proposals for new legislation. Regulatory 
impact assessments were included as part of explanatory memoranda for Bills from 1996 
onwards. A ministry drafting legislation must, according to Rules of Government, prepare an 
analysis of its potential impacts. Both the parliament (Riigikogu) and the government adhere to 
technical rules on drafting, which include the necessity to examine a list of impacts that need to 
be assessed when drafting legislation. In February 2005, a new rule came into operation under 
which each minister and state secretary may give additional recommendations regarding the 
methodology of regulatory impact assessment in their corresponding areas of competence. In Latvia, in 1998, the impact assessment system was introduced in the Rules of Procedure of 
the Government. The detailed methodology of impact assessment is set out in a government 
instruction. Transparency of Impact Assessments In some NMS, impact assessments are published. For example in Latvia, before a regulation is 
drafted, the need for the regulation is considered and the description of the current system must 
be set out in the Concept Paper 82 . Draft laws in Estonia must be accompanied by an explanatory 
letter. The explanatory letter is designed to oblige the drafter of a proposed law to explain the 
meaning of the draft law in simple language. The inclusion of comparative analysis and impact 
assessments in this letter is a useful device to explain why certain solutions were preferred. Methodologies Approaches to the methodology of impact assessment are different in all NMS that undertake 
impact assessments. Two main trends may be observed: some NMS have guidelines or are 
revising the existing guidelines; others leave the methodology to be determined by the ministry 
undertaking the assessment. In the Czech Republic, guidelines for regulatory impact assessment were being developed 
(2006) based on the UK and the new EU methodology. This work was scheduled to be 
completed by the end 2006. Some training to explain the concept and introduce the EU 
methodology was given to 50 civil servants by the Institute of State Administration (Central 
Training Unit). In Hungary, since January 2006, a new procedure on the Methodology of Regulatory Impact 
Assessment applied, based on a manual drawn up by the Department of Impact Analysis, 
Deregulation and Registration of Law. It applies during the preparatory phase of drafting laws 
and regulations. Measures laid down in the manual may be used in the course of preparing 
legislative proposals, and may also be applied (with variations) to other administrative 
organisations. 81 Since 2001. 82 Procedures for filling in annotations of draft regulatory enactments 18.09.2001. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 52 In Latvia, a general approach to impact assessment in policy documents is set out in Policy 
Planning Guidelines (2001), Regulatory impact assessment methodology is defined in the 
Government Instruction entitled  " filling in the Annotation of draft legal acts "  83 . There is also a 
Manual on Impact Assessment methods which is used in policy planning and legal drafting. That 
Manual was prepared by State Chancellery and published in 2005. It deals with the quantitative 
methods to be used in impact assessments, such as cost-benefit analysis, cost effectiveness 
analysis and risk analysis. In Lithuania, a Manual on Regulatory Impact Assessment was drawn up. It recommends that 
institutions dealing with EU legislation, or developing proposals that may have significant 
economic or social impacts, should carry out RIA by employing different tools such as 
cost-benefit analysis or other comprehensive studies. In Poland, in order to increase the effectiveness of the RIA process, the Ministry of the Economy 
prepared new RIA Guidelines which were adopted in October 2006. It is planned, after operating 
the new guidelines for 12 months, to evaluate their effectiveness. Institutional arrangements for 
RIA were implemented in 2006 in order to strengthen the RIA system, including placing 
responsibility for the review of RIA in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister instead of the 
Government Legislation Centre where it was until July 2006. The new guidelines clarify the key analytical steps to be taken in the undertaking of a RIA. The 
Guidelines constitute a set of logical steps which structure the preparation of policy proposal from 
identifying the problem, choosing objectives and main policy options, through comparing the 
possible options, assessing cost and benefits of each option to finally recommending the best 
solution. The emphasis in the revised Guidelines was put on: @BULLET 
Assessing the impacts in qualitative, quantitative and monetary terms where possible 
and appropriate. 
@BULLET 
Assessing the impact on SMEs. 
@BULLET 
Carrying out wide consultation before proposing legislation. The Slovak Republic provides a good example of how an impact assessment policy may be 
undermined if there is no unified methodology to assess impacts. A study on the general quality 
of the Annexes submitted to the Council of Ministers was conducted by the Ministry of Justice. 
The following problems were noted: @BULLET 
Many Annexes were unclear, inaccurate, or contained incomplete data; 
@BULLET 
A large number of Annexes were not prepared in line with the rules for their preparation; 
@BULLET 
Some Annexes did not contain all of the relevant information; 
@BULLET 
In some cases, the documents submitted to the Council of Ministers did not contain an 
Annex; 
@BULLET 
Very often, the author of the document or Bill did not submit the proposal for covering 
the estimated costs; 
@BULLET 
The second part of the Annex (impact on business and citizens) was almost always 
prepared very generally and without any proper costs. These problems were attributed, partly, to the lack of analytical capacities, and inadequate 
education and training of staff in ministries. Officials preparing legislation would appear to have 83 Instruction Nr. 4, 18.09.2001. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 53 variable approaches to providing information and tend to focus on the need to accelerate the 
legislative process and avoid conflicts with the Ministry of Finance. The weakness in the process is to be addressed. The Council of Ministers took a decision in July 
2005 84 directing the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister of Social 
Affairs, and the Minister of the Economy to draft unified methodologies for assessment in the 
Annex on financial, economic, environmental, social and business environment impacts. In Slovenia, the Better Regulation Group 85 is responsible for developing an impact assessment 
methodology. In addition, the Government Office for Legislation and the Official Gazette 
department are co-operating to develop an e-portal 86 . It will enable its users to carry out an 
impact assessment or check and verify their assessment results with the interested stakeholders. 
In practice, through this portal, citizens will be able to comment on a draft law and the results of 
the consultation process will be processed automatically and integrated into a pre-formatted 
report. Institutional Arrangements In the Czech Republic, a Department of Regulatory Reform and Quality of Public Administration, 
established after the transfer of the Better Regulation Unit from the Government Office to the 
Ministry of the Interior in November 2006, ensures a help desk function and checks the quality of 
the impact assessments carried out for all proposed regulation. In Estonia, the approach to impact assessment varies from ministry to ministry and there is no 
central body to review its quality. For example, the Ministry of Social Affairs has, as part of its 
process management initiatives, developed a legislative drafting procedure that involves both 
public consultation (during the early stage of policy-making) and regulatory impact assessments. 
The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Environment have undertaken similar initiatives. 
Some individuals in some ministries are more committed to improving impact assessment than 
others and a committee was established in the Ministry for the Environment to review and 
improve its approach to impact assessment. In Hungary, a Department of Impact Analysis, Deregulation and Registration of Law was 
established but was never formally conferred with overall responsibility for reviewing the quality 
of impact assessments. The Department was abolished in July 2006. However, the Law 
Department of the Government Office, while not having the role of reviewing or carrying out 
impact assessments centrally, may point out in its report to government the lack of such analysis 
in its report to the government. Impact assessments are mandatory in Latvia for all policy proposals and draft legal Acts with a 
socio-economic impact or an impact on the state budget. Impact assessments are reviewed in 
the State Chancellery and in line ministries, according to their respective competencies. Impact 
assessments that do not the required standard are returned to the ministry. What is Assessed? The table below provides an overview of a representative sample of impacts assessed. In some countries, a two-step approach is applied whereby an in-depth assessment is only 
necessary for pieces of legislation that are expected to have an impact on the business 
environment. 84 Cabinet resolution No. 557/2005. 85 It includes representatives from the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of the Economy. 86 eSodelovanje portal www.esodelovanje.si. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 54 In the Slovak Republic, the methodology for business impact assessment that is being drafted 
at the time of writing the report 87 at the Ministry of the Economy of the Slovak Republic, on the 
basis of the Netherlands methodology, requires a Ministry to do a 'quick test' to establish a rough 
estimate of the likely impacts. A full assessment is carried out for pieces of legislation ruling 
important issues. A similar approach is followed in Poland. Impacts to be assessed in Estonia 
Impact of a draft Act on the state budget or 
local government budgets 
Impact on the socio-economic situation, 
everyday life and opportunities of target groups 
[role occupants] (e.g., which socio-economic 
groups are going to profit or lose in legal, 
economic or social terms) 
Impact on economy and situation of 
businesses, e.g., inflation, competition, etc. 
Impact on organisation of the work of state and 
local government institutions (e.g., changes in

system 
The impact on international obligations 
(especially EU). 87 March 2006. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 55 Impacts to be assessed in Poland 
The following matter should be referred to in an 
impact assessment in Poland: 
񮽙 
Indicate who is affected; 
񮽙 
Present results of any consultation 
carried out; 
񮽙 
Identify impacts on: 
o public finances, including state 
and local budget, 
o labour market, 
o competitiveness, 
o entrepreneurship, 
o regional development; 
񮽙 
Indicate the financial resources. 
The method of assessment depends on the 
scope of the proposal. In the case of major 
regulations, there should be a quantitative 
assessment. In the case of other regulations, 
the assessment is limited to qualitative 
analysis. The most common quantitative 
method applied is cost-benefit analysis. 
However, other methods include: 
񮽙 
cost-effective analysis, 
񮽙 
the cost estimation, 񮽙 the benefit estimation.

environment. Ex Post In Cyprus and Malta, responsibility for conducting ex post impact analysis of regulations and 
policy implementation programmes rests in individual policy departments or special research 
services of ministries. Some ministries have undertaken studies to evaluate the effectiveness of 
policies using different methods. In Estonia, responsibility for conducting ex post impact analysis of regulations and policy 
implementation programmes rests also in individual policy departments or special research 
services of ministries. There is no external review of policy implementation or the effectiveness of 
regulations. For example, the Ministry of the Environment (Department of Forestry) ordered an ex 
post impact assessment of the Forest Act in 1996. Other ministries have undertaken studies to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, including 
aspects of income tax, social security, pension schemes, parent benefit, taxation and financing of 
NGOs, regional development policy, ownership reform in rural areas and student benefits. 
Reviews are conducted regulation by regulation as well as issue by issue. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 56 Ex post assessments are undertaken using different methods; some concentrate more on case 
law, some more on social aspects, much depends on the issue itself that is under evaluation. 
Some policies are reviewed as part of the planning for budgets of subsequent years and this 
activity may be seen reflected in the ministry's yearly activity plan. Representatives of target 
groups and other interested parties (e.g. research centres, other ministries) are involved in 
evaluation & ex post impact assessment of existing regulations. For example, in March 2005, the 
working group of the new Forest Act included all interested parties. Consultation Generally Consultation may be defined as 'a structured public engagement which involves seeking, 
receiving, analysing and responding to feedback from stakeholders.' It involves defining the 
purpose and subject of the consultation (policy initiative, regulatory change, legislative proposal). 
In most countries, consultation is mainly conducted on primary legislation and very rarely on 
secondary legislation. It also involves drawing up a consultation methodology, including criteria 
for identifying stakeholders. The potential for consultation is a function of the strength of civil society and of the procedures 
used, so principles laid down for consultation need to take into account particular domestic 
cultural and societal factors as well as the national institutional set up. Some countries have adopted guidelines on consultation, thereby providing the necessary 
political support for the consultation process within the Government system. The guidelines 
should be flexible and take into account different levels of organisation by stakeholders. A 
general time limit for consultations on draft laws should be set and compliance with the set of 
principles should be reviewed in the centre of government. The consultation process should be 
linked closely with the regulatory impact assessment process. The necessary elements seem to be the following: @BULLET 
Recommendations for how to select stakeholders to ensure a broad and useful input. 
@BULLET 
A minimum time for external consultation needs to be introduced. 
@BULLET 
Systems to ensure that the recommendations for selections and the minimum time have 
been complied with. 
@BULLET 
Dissemination of best practices. A distinction needs to be drawn between consultation within the government at the stage of the 
inter-ministerial comment procedure and consultation with the public in general which may be 
conducted through various procedures. In this regard, three main types of consultation with the 
public can be identified: @BULLET 
Consultation with established bodies, e.g., tripartite committees. 
@BULLET 
Consultation with ad hoc advisory groups. 
@BULLET 
Public notice published on the internet and submitted to public comment, which may 
facilitate on-going consultations. Why Consult? The use of public consultation has different implications for the improvement of the regulatory 
framework. Firstly, if it is undertaken in a timely and effective manner, consultation captures the collective 
intelligence of a society. It is increasingly being used to collect empirical information for analytical 
purposes, especially as a precondition for the move towards more analytically-based models of 
decision-making processes (e.g., the use of impact assessments to evaluate the impact of GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 57 regulations). Thus, consultation is a cost-effective source of data, as well as a source of 
information on issues such as the acceptability of various policies, which can be essential in 
determining practicability and designing compliance and enforcement strategies. Thereby, a 
consultation process is a valuable tool to improve the legitimacy and credibility of government 
actions. This data and information may also, in some countries, be used when carrying out 
regulatory impact assessments. Secondly, consultation mechanisms are also being increasingly characterised by greater 
openness and accessibility, particularly for smaller, less organised interests. This reflects a move 
away from corporatist modes of governance toward more pluralistic approaches. Consultation is 
inherent to transparent and effective governance. Finally, consultation is a partnership process that can improve the quality of legislation by 
involving expertise in civil society. Consultation in the EU The Commission has a long tradition of consulting interested parties on its policy and regulatory 
proposals. In order to improve its consultation processes, the Commission adopted a set of 
'General Principles and Minimum Standards for Consultation of Interested Parties'' 88 . The EU 
highly values consultation with interested parties 89 , and the collection and use of expertise 90 , 
which are both an integral part of the process. These principles and standards provide a framework for consulting civil society and stakeholders, 
which ensures transparency and access to consultations, feedback to contributors and a 
minimum reply time of 8 weeks. This action is linked to the impact assessment procedure and 
will, as a first step, apply to those initiatives subject to impact assessments. Nevertheless, the 
Commission's services are encouraged to apply those rules to any other consultations that they 
intend to launch. All consultations of special interest for businesses and professional organisations are accessible 
through DG Enterprise and Industry's dedicated web page Enterprise and Industry DG in 
Dialogue. DG Enterprise and Industry's consultations are also accessible through Your Voice in 
Europe, the Commission's 'single access point' for all its public consultations. Consultation in NMS Legal Basis In most NMS (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia), 
consultation forms part of the policy of regulation making rules as a compulsory requirement. In 
Lithuania, although public consultations are discretionary, some important laws such as the Law 
on Public Administration and the Law on Local Self-Government provide for compulsory 
consultation. Methodology All NMS have established different methods of conducting consultations. However, consultation 
procedures are not standardised in any NMS and even vary from one ministry to another. In 
addition, the type of consultation very often depends on the issue and its complexity, as well as 
on the body or people consulted. These variations may undermine the credibility of consultation 
exercises. The only factor in common is that none has a coherent written policy. 88 COM(2002)704 final, ibid. 89 COM (2002) 704 final, ibid. 90 COM(2002)713 final, http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/comm_expertise_en.pdf. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 58 In countries where civil society is more developed (Cyprus, Estonia, and Malta), consultation 
processes are conducted at various stages of the regulation making process on the basis of an 
agreed practice and rooted in a social dialogue and consensus tradition. However, this does not 
exclude some form of guidelines or established procedures. In Latvia and Slovenia, where there 
is little experience of consultation by Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), policies are being 
developed to train representatives from NGOs in consultation methodologies. In Cyprus and Malta, consultation exercises are not compulsory and there are no agreed 
procedures to carry them out. However, some more established consultation procedures have 
been adopted. The Code of Practice on Consultation of the Malta Environment and Planning 
Authority, for example, describes the policy-making process and provides for guidelines on why 
and how consultation should be conducted. In addition, for secondary legislation, the check list 
requires that consultation take place. However, other than Cyprus and Malta, many of the countries assessed did not have a tradition 
of consultation. Many officials we spoke to during the assessment expressed the view that 
consultation was a burdensome process and that civil society had not the capacity to be 
responsive to consultation procedures, though these officials fell short of taking the position that 
the administration knows what is best for the citizen. Consultation with the Public In many NMS, recent legislation required that draft regulations be published on an official website 
so that each citizen may comment on the draft. However, it is too early to judge what value is 
added by the consultations. In Hungary, by virtue of section 19 of the Act 91 on the Protection of Personal Data and Open 
Access to Public Information, the state, local-government or other public organisations defined by 
law is required to publish electronically or by other means all relevant data related to their 
activities. The ministries post the texts of draft legislation on the public bulletin boards of the 
so-called 'Green Spider' network, based on the concept of 'open legislation' whereby, according 
to the Act on the Freedom of Electronic Information, draft laws are published on the internet, 
together with a submission deadline for comments. In Latvia, all proposals of importance are put on the website of the State Chancellery before their 
consideration at the weekly meeting of the State Secretaries. In Poland, following the Act on Lobbying, all government policies and initiatives should be 
communicated to the public (especially, via internet sites of ministries) and that Act affirms the 
right of everyone to comment on legislative proposals. In addition, certified professional lobbyists 
communicate their comments on a given draft and can access the draft in the Bulletin for Public 
Information. 92 However, much of the material on accessibility of legislation is included in the Law 
on Access to Public Information. In the Slovak Republic, according to the Law on Free Access to Information, all pieces of 
legislation, including guidelines and draft proposals for legal regulations, are made available on 
government websites. Some consultation practices are worth mentioning: In Estonia, the Web 'Talk along' 93 initiative is 
an innovative way of involving citizens in the formulation of policy and the drafting of legislation. 
Everyone has the opportunity to register on the involvement Web and, through the website, 
notices can be sent by e-mail about consultations and changes in the legislative drafting work 91 LXIII/1992 in force since June 1, 2005. 92 Order No. 1/2006 (I. 7.) GKM on the Communication of the Ministry. 93 www.mkm.ee/index.php?id=8252. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 59 plan. In Latvia, a Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up in 2005 between Government 
and NGOs and handbooks have been published for NGOs and training of officials in consultation 
techniques. In addition, a representative of NGOs may attend the State Secretaries' meetings 
and the Cabinet of Ministers' meetings as an observer and may suggest proposals. Consultation with Established Bodies and Stakeholders The consultation with business and civil society representatives in NMS is often conducted 
through regular meetings of a committee comprising representatives from social organisations 
and NGOs, as in Cyprus, Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland, or following more ad hoc initiatives, 
or a combination of the two, as in the Slovak Republic. In any case, from the point of view of the 
consulting party, it is not always easy to identify the relevant organisations or the persons in 
organisations who are the most appropriate to consult with. In Cyprus, depending on the issue and on the existing legislation, the examination of the 
proposal by a committee such as, for example, the Labour Advisory Board or the Joint Staff 
Committee may be required. The Joint Staff Committee is consulted on all issues concerned with 
terms and conditions of civil servants and comprises interested parties from the private sector as 
well as from the civil service. In the Czech Republic, the Legislative Rules enable a form of public consultation to take place. 
However, the authority responsible for the preparation of the law has discretion as to whether 
and how it will consult with bodies such as NGOs. In the case of labour, the Tripartite Council 
(Government, Unions and Employers) must be consulted. In addition, following the recent 
amendment to the Legislative Rule of Government, the Economic Chamber has become an 
official participant in the inter-ministerial comment procedure and can send its comments to the 
relevant ministry. Furthermore, the adoption of the Methodology of Public Consultations by the 
Government is expected in 2007. In Hungary, there are several government institutions designed to ensure stakeholder 
involvement, e.g., the employment consent mechanism with the involvement of employers' and 
employees' representation 94 . A typical consultation body is the National Environmental Council, 
which meets once a week and has a secretariat run by the Ministry of the Environment. In Lithuania, a Tripartite Council of Lithuania (Government, Business interests and trade unions) 
was established in 1995 to deal with social, economic and labour issues. In Poland, depending on the issue regulated, the government seeks the opinion of established 
bodies, including: @BULLET 
The Joint Committee of the Central Government and Territorial Government, in each 
case if the draft concerns operations of the territorial government. 
@BULLET 
The Tripartite Committee for Social and Economic Affairs composed of representatives 
of employees, employers and central government. 
@BULLET 
The Copyright Committee. 
@BULLET 
Sectoral regulators. In the Slovak Republic, many ministries have advisory bodies which are consulted on major 
new proposals. The Minister of the Economy established a Business Environment Board, 
comprising representatives of the Slovak Chamber of Industry and other business associations. 
Bills and policy proposals relating to economic and social issues are discussed within the 
framework of the Council of Social and Economic Agreement. In addition, in many cases, an ad 94 Z. Kovacsy (2005), The Occurrence and Quality of Information on Impact Assessment in Proposals to the Government on 
Draft Acts in Hungary. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 60 hoc advisory committee or a working group of civil servants and experts is established. Extensive 
consultation with non-governmental institutions (e.g., the Association of Slovak Towns and 
Municipalities, the Union of Agricultural Cooperatives of Slovakia) is also organised. NMS: Lessons on Taking Results of Consultation into Account Whatever the consultation procedure may be, it remains formal unless a systematic policy to 
assess the comments provided by the public, and take into account the relevant ones, is applied. 
In Estonia, the Government estimates that about 5% of the amendments proposed within the 
framework of the web talk along process are accepted. Latvia has developed several procedures to ensure that the opinion of civil society is reflected in 
its regulations. The first stage is the publication or announcement of the draft. After publication 
comments made are collected and, if necessary, meetings are held to review the comments, a 
summary of all ministry proposals, including arguments for accepting or rejecting each proposal, 
is prepared and accompanies the draft document when it is returned to the meeting of the State 
Secretaries for approval. In addition, an NGO with an interest in issues to be discussed at the Cabinet of Ministers meeting 
can apply to the Director of the State Chancellery to attend the Cabinet of Ministers' meeting. In 
exceptional circumstances, the NGO may be given the opportunity, at the discretion of the Prime 
Minister, to make a statement at the meeting. A representative of NGOs attending a State 
Secretaries' meeting may submit views to State Secretaries and reasons must be given if they 
are not taken into account. In Poland, according to the Rules of Procedure of the Council of Ministers and the Standing 
Orders of the Sejm 95 the results of public consultations conducted for a specific regulation must 
be set out in the corresponding RIA. In addition, a number of ministries have set up internal 
procedures to handle public comments. For example, comments made by the public on a 
regulation drafted by the legal department of the Ministry of Justice are sent to the Codification 
Committee for civil law or the Codification Committee for criminal law, which decides whether the 
remarks are justified and need to be inserted into the draft. However, in practice, RIAs rarely contain the result of the consultations conducted; this 
information is replaced by a commitment added to the RIA text according to which  " the results of 
the consultation will be included later " . When stakeholders comment on a draft regulation, they 
do not systematically receive feedback from ministries. In the Slovak Republic, where 500 or more people comment on a proposal their views must be 
considered. If the proposal is not accepted by the government, it must give reasons to the 
citizens who presented the proposals. It may sometimes be difficult to combine all the comments made by the public and various 
stakeholders in a consultation process. Submissions to the process may be contradictory. In Slovenia, a pilot project was carried out on the e-archiving law using the eSodelovanje portal: 
86% of the participants stated they would participate again via the portal and 75% of all 
comments received were incorporated in the final version of the draft law. Assessing the relevance and whether the comments are representative of a wide range of views 
is not easy for any country, nor is it easy to avoid the risk of consultation fatigue. Alternatives to Traditional Regulations — Generally Alternatives to traditional 'command and control legislation come in different forms. They include: 95 Article 34.3 of the Rules of Procedure. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 61 @BULLET 
More flexible, less prescriptive forms of traditional regulation, performance-based and 
incentive regulation allowing the regulated to develop their own approach to achieving 
the desired outcomes; this maximizes flexibility and innovation while achieving the 
desired objectives. Examples include compliance with occupational health and safety 
requirements, environmental emission requirements and price regulation of firms with 
monopoly power. 
@BULLET 
Co-regulation and self-regulation, such as codes of conduct, for which the industry itself 
is responsible for enforcing. 
@BULLET 
Incentive and market-based instruments: taxes and subsidies (to align private and social 
objectives more closely; pro-competitive reforms (removal of regulation and restrictions 
that inhibit market operation); creating markets (tradable permits, periodic tendering for 
service provision), 
@BULLET 
Information approach: education and persuasion are used to achieve the community's 
objectives; government provided information; reporting requirements; advertising 
campaigns. 
@BULLET 
No specific action, i.e., the option to do nothing. The use of alternatives to traditional regulations in a given country reflects the extent to which a 
government addresses the question 'is regulation the best way to achieve a policy outcome?' 
Experience and knowledge of alternatives is continuing to develop but their use is very context 
specific and, arguably, the most effective approach may be to have a range of tools brought to 
bear on a policy problem with 'command and control' legislation only being brought to bear where 
alternatives have failed 96 . The potential to use such policy options is a function of a range of factors, including respect for 
the rule of law, political stability, lack of corruption and a confidence that results can be achieved 
without the ultimate sanction of a fine or imprisonment. Most OECD reports on Regulatory 
Reform recommend that policy makers should give due attention, wherever possible, to the use 
of alternatives to traditional 'command and control' regulation. Why Use Alternatives to Regulations? Many disadvantages and problems arise from the use of a 'command and control' approach, 
such as regulatory failure, lack of flexibility and lack of adequate resources to enforce or secure 
adequate compliance. In practice, in many situations, there may be a range of options other than 
traditional 'command and control' regulation available to achieve the government's policy 
objectives. Although there may be considerable scepticism among policy makers and the public regarding 
the use of alternative instruments, it is widely accepted that traditional regulation is not always 
the most effective policy tool to ensure enforcement of, and compliance with, a policy and that 
alternatives to traditional regulations should be considered more systematically. Alternatives to Traditional Regulations in the EU The Commission's revised impact assessment guidelines require that all non-legislative options, 
including the 'do nothing' option are given equal consideration during the impact assessment 
process. The European Commission accepts the principle that early and effective consideration 
should always be given to alternative approaches to classic regulation, to make greater use of 
alternatives to traditional legislation without undermining the provisions of the Treaty or the 
prerogatives of the legislator. It suggests that certain policy objectives can be achieved with the 96 See Alternatives to Traditional Regulation Working Party on Regulatory Management and Reform (OECD) GOV/PGC/REG 
(2006) 9. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 62 use of alternative regulations, such as New Approach Directives, co-regulation, self-regulation, 
social partners' agreements, market-based instruments, recommendations, and information or 
guidance. This approach was strengthened by the 2003 Inter-institutional Agreement on Better 
Law-making 97 which encourages the use of alternatives to regulation. Alternatives to Traditional Regulations in NMS All NMS had used one or more alternatives at different times, though most officials interviewed in 
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia were not familiar 
with the potential to use alternatives as a policy option and a 'command and control' mentality 
prevails. Alternatives to regulations may take various forms, such as educational campaigns. In all 
Member States there was an awareness of educational campaigns in respect of issues such as 
software piracy. Codes of conduct are used in Cyprus and Lithuania in a number of fields, 
notably in regulating professions such as lawyers. Estonian officials were also keen to mention that their response was not automatically to 
regulate but to find the most efficient and effective means to achieve policy results. In Malta, although not required, a number of entities have adopted a policy of assessing 
alternative policy instruments prior to instituting new policy actions. These include, amongst 
others, the Treasury, Customs Division, the Ministry for Family and Social Solidarity and the 
Broadcasting Authority. In Poland, the Methodological Foundations of RIA and the newly adopted RIA Guidelines 
encourage the identification of alternative options to choose the best solution. However, as these 
RIA guidelines were only introduced in October 2006, it is too soon to evaluate their 
effectiveness. Simplification Generally Why is Simplification Needed? A priority in any simplification programme is the requirement to ensure that all written 
communications between government and the citizen, including laws, are as simple as the 
subject matter permits. Lack of clarity of language or difficulties in accessing legislation reduces 
respect for the law and may contribute to regulatory failures. Accessibility of regulations is as an 
essential element of a transparent and open system of democratic governance. The principle of 
accessibility may require a particular effort of communication on the part of the public authorities 
involved, for example, in some cases information needs to be targeted at those persons who, 
because of their situation, have difficulty in asserting their rights. The second aspect of simplification is that it is a means to reduce the administrative burden. 
Member States of the EU are becoming more aware of the costs of administrative burdens and 
the need to make regulatory requirements as simple as possible. In an age when investors 
compare administrative burdens between countries when making investment decisions, no 
country can fail to appreciate the costs of administrative burdens or fail to take steps to simplify 
regulations. 97 COM(2003)770, http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/com2005_0098en01.pdf. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 63 Beyond the general efforts undertaken in OECD countries to keep their regulations up to date in 
order to maintain their competitiveness, specific grounds for legislation review in the NMS studied 
may be found in two additional reasons. In some cases a substantial review of the body of law may be undertaken in the period 
immediately following the transition from one regime to another. It was the case in the period 
immediately following the communist period in most Central and Eastern European countries. In 
some countries such a review does not take place as constitutional arrangements are made to 
carry over certain laws from the previous regime. When Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960, the Constitution provided for 
continuation of English common law. As a result, many laws remain in force even though they 
are in English and need to be translated into Greek. Secondly, a large volume of regulations has been added to the stock as a result of the adoption 
of the acquis communautaire. Nevertheless, the hectic pace of law making, with frequent 
amendments, means that many texts are difficult to read. There is a need to review the stock of 
regulation from the point of view of coherence. In most countries studied concern was expressed 
about the quality of the transposition process for the acquis communautaire. Simplification in the EU The Mandelkern Report recommended that simplification should become a general policy in the 
behaviour of Member States and EU Institutions. This has involved the establishment of a rolling 
and targeted 'SimpReg' (SR) programme. Its remit extended to regulation beyond the Internal 
Market and to regulation that impacts on citizens and on public bodies charged with 
implementing it, as well as on business, thus covering the entire field of European regulation. This work builds on earlier initiatives whereby the Institutions of the European Union adopted a 
policy on guidance for drafting legislation, contained in the Inter-Institutional Agreement of 
December 1998, relating to the quality of drafting of Community legislation. They ensured the 
guidelines were applied by restructuring their internal organisation, insofar as they found it 
necessary to do so. 98 These earlier initiatives led to a programme of consolidation which involved the Publications 
Office of the EU in an exercise to integrate the basic instruments of Community legislation, their 
amendments and corrections, in single, non-official documents. These documents aim to provide 
more transparency and easier access to EU Law. Several legal texts, initially and officially 
published in different issues of the 'Official Journal of the European Communities' are combined 
as a 'consolidated family' in one easy-to-read document 99 . The Commission has a three-fold approach to simplification of form: @BULLET 
Repeal of regulations that are no longer of practical utility. 
@BULLET 
Codification, which is a reframing of regulations that have been amended excessively, 
so that they may be more easily read but leaving the content unchanged. 
@BULLET 
Recasting (the process of redrafting, so that regulations may be more easily read 
through revised drafting of particularly complex measures, and changes where 
necessary to make the regulations more effective). This exercise builds on an earlier exercise where the Commission had asked Member States, 
businesses and citizens to tell it where red tape and over-regulation could be cut. 98 Declaration 39, ibid., note 8. 99 See http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/information/help/help-consleg.html for a full account of the process and access to 
consolidations. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 64 Repeal of Regulations that are no Longer of Practical Utility The Institutions of the EU are committed to a programme of repeal, i.e., a programme to remove 
spent regulations or regulations that are no longer of practical utility or unused legislation from 
the acquis. This work is undertaken in parallel with recasting work. Codification Codification work is also taking place in the Institutions of the EU. Codification contributes greatly 
to the reduction in volume of Community legislation. To codify means to assemble an original 
legal Act, plus all subsequent modifying Acts, in one new legal text. Recasting This is the task of revising the form and structure of legislation where frequent or substantial 
amendment renders its contents difficult to follow and changes in policy require a review of the 
whole area of legislation concerned. The 2005 Communication on Simplification The Commission's Better Regulation efforts focus on simplifying and updating the existing body 
of EU legislation. The Commission launched a new phase, including a work programme. In its 
Communication entitled: A Strategy for the Simplification of the Regulatory Environment 100 , the 
review of the acquis communautaire has become a continuous and systematic process enabling 
the legislator to revise legislation, taking all legitimate private sector and public interests into 
account. This encompasses: @BULLET 
A rolling programme anchored in stakeholders' practical experience. 
@BULLET 
An approach based on continuous in-depth sectoral assessment. Following a broad consultation of Member States and stakeholders, the Commission proposes to 
repeal, codify, recast or modify 222 basic pieces of legislation (now regrouped into 100) in the 
next 3 years. The programme will be regularly updated. It has started with the most heavily 
regulated sectors such as cars, waste and construction. Other sectors such as foodstuffs, 
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or services will follow. The 2006 Strategic Review The Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the EU includes a section on simplification. 
Complimentarily, a Commission Working Document reports for the first time the progress 
achieved since the launch of the strategy in October 2005 and presents new developments 
towards further streamlining of the regulatory environment. In this context, 43 new initiatives will 
enhance the simplification rolling programme for the period 2006-2009. For 2007, 58 
simplification initiatives are planned. Screening and Withdrawal Exercise In parallel, the Commission set up a screening exercise targeting the flow of proposals still 
pending before the legislator. After screening 183 proposals for EU laws pending at the 
European Parliament and Council, the Commission selected 67 proposals pending, which were 
legally withdrawn when the list of proposals was published in the Official Journal on 17 March 
2006. These proposals were withdrawn because some were inconsistent with the objectives of 
the new 'Partnership for Growth and Jobs' or did not meet Better Regulation standards. Others 
were not advancing in the legislative process, or were simply outdated. 100 COM(2005)535 final, ibid. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 65 A new screening exercise was organised to complete the 2005 one: 79 proposals pending 
adopted by the Commission between 1 January 2004 and 21 November 2004 (end of term of the 
previous Commission) have been examined using the same criteria as for the 2005 screening. 
Final results were announced in the Strategic Review Communication. The Commission informed 
Parliament and Council as required, providing a justification for withdrawal for ten proposals in 
total 101 . As a reasonable time elapsed without any reactions from their part, the list of withdrawals 
was published in the Official Journal of 22 March 2007. Measuring Administrative Costs The Standard Cost Model (SCM) was designed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance for the purpose 
of quantification of administrative burden caused by a particular regulation or a set of legal 
standards, within the remit of a particular authority, during a specified time period, and for the 
purpose of enabling comparability between regulations and departments. In order to meet the 
administrative burden caused by the relevant information obligation imposed on business by the 
State through regulation, businesses are required to perform a sequence of activities. A similar 
model was developed in Denmark: The cost of meeting the information obligation = the sum of the costs of all activities 
necessary to meet the obligation. 
The overall administrative burden following from regulation = the sum of the costs 
incurred to meet all information obligations following from such regulation. 
The cost P of performing an activity can be calculated as follows: P = tariff * time 102 . 
The number Q of activities carried out during a given period is calculated as follows: 
Q = number of businesses * frequency 103 . Administrative Costs (EU) The Commission issued a Communication on 21 October 2005 outlining a common methodology 
to measure administrative costs in EU proposals. More recently, the Commission Working Document on Administrative Costs, adopted on 14 
November 2006, presents a broad strategy towards the reduction of administrative burdens, 
using some results of the pilot project. This pilot identifies policy areas that are most responsible 
for creating administrative burdens, by carrying out a cross-country comparison of the Member 
States that have already done a baseline measurement. An Action Programme, presented on 24 January 2007, demonstrates in concrete terms the way 
in which the Commission intends to work with Member States to cut administrative burdens on 
businesses by a quarter by 2012. The Programme focuses on information obligations in thirteen 
selected priority areas including company law, employment relations, taxation/VAT, statistics, 
agriculture and transport. The Action Programme also includes a first series of 'fast track actions' 
where significant benefits could be generated through relatively minor changes in the underlying 
legislation. The measures could reduce the burdens on businesses by 1.3 billion euro. 101 Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005 on relations between the EP and the Commission (paragraph 32). 102 There exist two types of tariff – internal and external. The internal tariff is comprised of the unit costs per worker performing 
the relevant activity within the business (hourly payroll costs + additional expenses) and the cost of materials. The external 
tariff means, for instance, the hourly rate for the work of an external expert of organisation fulfilling the information 
requirement on behalf of the relevant business. Time means the number of time units (hours) taken to carry out the required 
activity. The required time may be determined by interviewing employers and employees. 103 The number of businesses relates to businesses affected by the regulation, which are thus required to carry out the activity in 
question pursuant to the regulation and the ensuing information obligation. Frequency indicates how many times one 
business carries out the activity in a year. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 66 The Commission intends to tackle administrative burden, especially for small businesses, by 
simplifying, for example, cumbersome statistics. However, significant results can only be 
achieved if the European Parliament and Council as co-legislators support it and work to develop 
this support is undertaken. It should also be noted that much EC legislation is to be found in Directives which require 
Member States to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. 
Consequentially, many administrative burdens are imposed by Member States. A large duty falls, 
therefore, on Member States to ensure that their administrative procedures are as efficient and 
least burdensome as possible in accordance with the complexity and the risks associated with 
particular legislation. Simplification NMS Action Plans Most of the NMS have recognised the need for simplifying procedures to enhance the 
competitiveness of their economy. This concern is reflected in governmental statements and 
reform programmes relating to the Better Regulation agenda. In the Czech Republic, the government adopted an Action Plan of Reducing Administrative 
Burden on Businesses in April 2005, as well as a Methodology of Measurement of Administrative 
Burden, based on the Dutch Standard Cost Model. A baseline measurement of administrative 
burden imposed on businesses was then conducted and completed by December 2005. The 
results of the measurements undertaken by particular ministries and central state administration 
authorities were summarised in the report Analysis of Administrative Burden on Businesses 
published in 2006. The results were used to prepare the proposal for the next phase of the 
process, which should be submitted for the government's approval in 2007. It is envisaged that 
mandatory, ex ante administrative burden assessment will be introduced. In 2006, the Ministry of Justice in Estonia published an action plan to simplify a large number of 
areas that affect businesses. It includes: @BULLET 
Simplification of company law. 
@BULLET 
Proposals to improve the quality of notaries. 
@BULLET 
Reforms of labour law. 
@BULLET 
A proposal concerning cost-based fees. 
@BULLET 
Improvements in planning and construction laws. The most important components of the comprehensive programme to rationalise governmental 
administration up to 2006 were: elimination of superfluous or parallel responsibilities of ministries 
and state authorities, internal rationalisation of ministerial functioning and simplification of the 
vertical structure of authorities. A Commissioner was appointed by the government for the 
rationalisation of governmental administration. The Programme of Government (2006) renewed the commitment of the government to prioritise 
the simplification of certain laws and to take steps to simplify the business regulatory 
environment. It has set a number of goals, including that of simplifying the taxation system for 
small companies, given the importance of SMEs for the Hungarian economy. In Latvia, an annual action plan for improving the business environment has been adopted by 
the government since 1999 and is regularly revised. The Latvian Investment and Development 
Agency (LIDA) regularly commissions surveys and reports on the state of the business 
environment to measure the extent to which the implementation of the action plan was successful GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 67 in this regard and to identify new priority areas for reforms. 104 In addition, the operational 
programme Human resources and Employment contains provisions designed to develop projects 
relating to the reduction of administrative burdens for citizens and entrepreneurs. In Lithuania, the Action Plan for Implementation of the Strategy for the Public Administration 
Development up to 2010 included a number of actions aimed at simplification of proposed and 
existing regulations such as: @BULLET 
Preparing a manual that will be the basis for estimation and assessment of 
administrative costs for businesses. The objective of this action is to determine the 
concept of administrative costs and to define methods of assessment of administrative 
costs for businesses. 
@BULLET 
Reconsidering legal regulation of different business areas in order to reduce 
administrative burdens and simplify legal regulation for business. A further initiative to reduce administrative burdens was the establishment of a Working Group by 
the Prime Minister 105 to analyse the functions of institutions inspecting businesses and to put 
forward a proposal for improving these functions. The Working Group presented its report, along 
with an action plan, in 2004 and follow up action is underway. In Slovenia, the Programme for the reduction of administrative burden for the year 2006 
consisted of 34 measures. Each ministry submitted to the Ministry for Public Administration a 
series of proposals for simplification with an explanatory comment in each and a timetable for the 
implementation of the proposed simplification or reduction of administrative burdens. The 
explanatory comment stated whether or not it would be necessary to amend legislation to 
achieve the desired result. Among the 34 measures are the reduction of administrative delays, 
extension of the 'one-stop-shop' project for limited companies 106 , reduction of the number of 
licences necessary for crafts 107 , simplification of the permission acquisition procedure for 
planning permission for new buildings, simplification of rights on parent custody and easier 
access to public procurement by SMEs. Measuring Administrative Costs — NMS In most of the NMS, there is no procedure to measure administrative costs or to collect 
quantitative data on the various impacts regulations may have on businesses and citizens. 
Arguably, the lack of a measurement of administrative costs or a baseline by which to make 
comparisons weakens impact assessments undertaken for proposed legislation that will impose 
a burden and it undermines the potential to conduct ex post assessment and ex post reviews of 
regulations. The need to measure administrative costs is under consideration in many countries and, for 
example, in Lithuania, there is an acceptance amongst officials that the lack of substantive 
indicators prevents policy makers from determining whether planned outcomes are delivered 
effectively. The Czech Republic, Poland and the Slovak Republic have launched pilot projects or have 
undertaken surveys in order to measure administrative costs and assess how friendly the 
business regulatory framework is. The quality of the work varies, in accordance with the 
enthusiasm of the officials. 104 http://www.liaa.gov.lv/eng/Incentives/Business_Environment/?doc=457: The latest (2005) report indicates steady 
improvements in the Latvian business environment. 105 Ordinance of the Prime Minister No 239  " On Establishement of Working Group " , adopted on October 22, 2003. 106 A proposal to establish a one-stop-shop for the establishment of companies. 107 For example, the need to have a licence to manage a hairdressing establishment or work in a shop. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 68 In Cyprus, a number of surveys have been undertaken on the initiative of either the Public 
Administration or Personnel Department of the Ministry of Finance, or the relevant department or 
service, for the reduction of red tape. Cyprus is recognised as having an administrative structure 
which is business friendly. In Estonia, two pilot projects were being undertaken in 2006, with obvious interest, in the Ministry 
of Economic Affairs and Communications in order to test the Dutch Standard Cost Model. 
Several ministries and offices (e.g., Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of the 
Environment, and the Statistical Office and the Tax and Customs Board) have been involved in 
the leading group for testing the model. In contrast, one official in Hungary commented that the results of surveys of this kind are 
sometimes unsatisfying as the task of collecting information about administrative costs is carried 
out sporadically and there is very often a strong reluctance on the part of officials to participate in 
these types of projects. Nevertheless, a joint project was initiated by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice in 
Hungary to assess the administrative burdens of VAT regulations. The Minister of Justice 
initiated a comprehensive programme for the reduction of administrative burdens, which is based 
on the Standard Cost Model, but is completed by the survey of economic costs beyond the 
business sphere (costs for the citizens). The first phase (total mapping of the burdensome 
regulations) was planned for the first half of 2005. As the project budget was reduced to a 
minimum, it is being undertaken with fewer resources over a longer period of time. Results are 
not expected before the middle of 2007. In Poland, three pilot projects have already been implemented: @BULLET 
A study, supported by the Office of the Committee for European Integration, was 
completed in December 2005 on the SCM and the perceptions of administrative costs in 
the road transport sector. 
@BULLET 
Another study, supported by the Ministry of Finance, was aimed at measuring the 
administrative costs related to compliance with the information obligations required to be 
met by VAT payers in Poland. This study gave a rather alarming picture of the tax 
sector, since the level of administrative barriers was estimated at approximately 45.7% 
of all tax revenues in 2004. 
@BULLET 
A third study was conducted on the initiative of the National Bank of Poland on 
administrative costs relating to the application of banking law. A plan for administrative burden reduction was submitted to the Council of Ministers, together 
with the comprehensive Regulatory Reform Programme, for adoption in August 2006. The lessons learned during the first benchmark were used to improve the method. In 2005 
Poland and the Netherlands have conducted a benchmark on transport legislation. This was 
done according to the benchmarking method described in the international manual. The results of 
this benchmark are set out in Benchmark Transport EU Legislation Poland – The Netherlands 108 . 
For Poland, the benchmark was part of a more extensive research into their transport 
legislation 109 . In the Slovak Republic, a paper 110 prepared on the initiative of the National Agency for 
Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (NADSME), assessed the status and identified 108 See: www.administrative-burdens.com. 109 See: M. Gancarz., M. Kaluzynska (2005), The Standard Cost Model and Perceptions of Administrative Burdens in the Road 
Transport Sector, Office of the Committee for European Integration, Warsaw, Poland. 110 2004. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 69 the most significant factors influencing the business environment of Slovakia in 2004. However, 
the paper recognises that there is not sufficient data available to measure administrative costs 
burdening SMEs. Simplification of Form No coherent pattern can be seen in the NMS as regards the simplification of the form (language, 
style, structure, coherence, including its accessibility) of legislation. Some countries have 
undertaken extensive reforms while others do so on an 'as needed' basis. In 2005, a systematic review of the regulations of the government was undertaken, coordinated 
by the State Chancellery. As a result of this review, regulations that were no longer of practical 
utility or were ultra vires, were repealed 111 . Each year the Legal Chancellor in Estonia gives an overview to the parliament of the conformity 
of the legislation, generally, with the Constitution and general principles of law 112 . This usually 
results in amendments being made to correct errors discovered in laws. A systematic review of 
the regulations of the government and the ministers, coordinated by the State Chancellery, was 
undertaken in 2005. A review 113 has been undertaken to repeal spent or unused legislation and progress is being 
made towards requiring public bodies to seek information from their own records rather than 
impose the burden on citizens of repeatedly providing the same information. There is no policy to simplify the language used in legislation, although the Constitutional Court 
ruled that Article 2 of the Constitution, which refers to the legal certainty principle, also includes 
the clarity of norms. On this basis, it declared invalid a regulation because of its complexity. In Hungary, a simplification exercise was undertaken after the fall of communism which 
addressed the form and content of the stock of legislation. It was believed to be essential to 
reduce the number of rules that had no longer any practical utility and several systematic 
deregulation programmes were implemented. Further initiatives to deregulate were undertaken, following the same principles and policy. The 
2004 Programme on Law Simplification contained the task of mapping the changes in 
administrative costs caused by new legislation over a 4-month period. Having received 
responses from the ministries, the coordinating unit of the Ministry of Justice suspended this 
project and, instead, asked ministries for ideas from their own experiences for simplification. The 
proposal for the year 2005 was formulated having regard to these experiences 114 . 111 See Administrative Procedures Act, Section 93 (1):  " A regulation is valid until it is repealed by an administrative authority of 
the Supreme Court, or until expiry, or until repeal of the provision delegating authority. "  112 See the 2004 English version of the overview: http://www.oiguskantsler.ee/.files/36.pdf. 113 There have been several specific projects to assess the potential to reduce the administrative burdens of legislation. For 
example, in 2001, a study was undertaken by PRAXIS. It involved three areas: 񮽙 mapping out and analysing the specific and procedural issues related to the licensing of business activity from both the 
government and corporate points of view. The goal was to deliver specific guidelines for the government to enable it to 
reorganise the current licensing procedure, and make the Estonian business climate more entrepreneur-friendly. 񮽙 Reviewing the regulations on the Law on Administrative Procedure. 񮽙 A study of checklists, and their use, to ensure due cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of 
government in updating the administrative procedure. In this project, PRAXIS's partners were government agencies and 
the Riigikogu. The project team compiled checklists that would enable speedy analysis of a draft law entailing 
administrative procedure (especially licensing). The checklists could be eventually used by legislators and Riigikogu 
committees. The goal is to ensure standard government regulation, reduce the complexity of administrative procedure 
and create a tool for coordinated policy-making. 114 Recent Regulatory Reform activities in Hungary, ibid. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 70 In addition, within the framework of a comprehensive anti-bureaucracy programme, the Ministry 
of Finance has started to screen the financial legislation to identify possible areas of 
simplification. Codexes exist in several areas, such as criminal law and civil law. However, there 
is a view that there is a tendency to have too many specific codexes. In Latvia, where 50% or more of the articles of a draft regulation need to be amended, a new 
version of the regulation must be issued. Simplification of Procedures There is a variety of approaches to simplification in the NMS. In some NMS, concern for 
simplification is driven by the business sector. In the Slovak Republic, for example, 
administrative costs were considered in a 2004 paper prepared on the initiative of the National 
Agency for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises 115 , which assessed the status and 
development of SMEs in the Slovak Republic. In most NMS, a number of simplification initiatives and proposals for the reduction of 
administrative burdens are in place but their number and variety suggest the need to consolidate 
them, in order to ensure that they are focussed and that the full benefits of these policies can be 
achieved. One way to reduce administrative burdens is to reduce the occurrence of circumstances where 
the same information is sought by several authorities. For example, in Estonia and Latvia, new 
laws are reviewed to ensure that the production of a piece of information is not required from 
citizens where that information is already available to the authority. In Estonia, institutions have been given the right to authenticate copies of original documents 
presented to them and issued by them, so that the citizens do not have to go to notaries to have 
documents authenticated. In Latvia, if a state body is obliged to establish whether it already has the information before it 
requests it from a person or small business. An audit of the bureaucratic procedures in order to 
ensure considerable simplification and transparent decision-making is foreseen. It is planned to 
review the body of legislation to ensure that the principle 'ask once use many times' is applied. One-stop-shops Another way consists in establishing a contact point with citizens such as 'one-stop-shops' where 
citizens and businesses may complete several kinds of administrative procedures. In Cyprus, the first 'one-stop-shop' for citizens was opened in December 2005 so as to deliver 
better access to certain categories of government information and a range of services. It brings 
together the following services: identity documents, car registration, health and social benefits. In Malta, the Malta Tourism Authority acts as a 'one-stop-shop' for tourism-related businesses. 
The Small Business Directorate, within the Commerce Division of the Ministry for 
Competitiveness and Communication, operates a helpline for small businesses that have 
difficulties with red tape. It forwards complaints of excessive red tape reported by businesses to 
the responsible authorities. 115 The paper pointed out that the most significant factors influencing the business environment of Slovakia in 2004 were the 
implementation of the new tax system, making administrative procedures required upon business start up more efficient, the 
changes in the system of social security to a system of social insurance, the improvement of communication with tax offices 
and the adoption of more flexible bankruptcy legislation. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 71 Information Technology (IT) In general, most of the initiatives taken rely on the use of IT tools to simplify procedures and to 
improve the coordination between authorities and all the stakeholders involved and, in general, to 
develop a more citizen-friendly administration. Regarding the use of IT tools and e-government in general, some NMS are more advanced than 
others. However, the development of IT tools may result in reducing administrative burdens, 
provided internet access is well developed, which may not be the case in some NMS, such as 
Latvia. In 1998, the government initiated an 'Information Systems Strategy' was set up in Cyprus. In the 
last 5 years, improvements have been made not only in the number but also in the level of the 
public services provided through the web. Most of the government ministries or departments or 
services have their own websites. The majority of the websites are informative and provide 
downloading of forms and other documents. Some also support user interaction. In the last few years improvements have been made not only in the number but also in the level 
of e-services provided to the public. All Government Ministries/Departments/Services maintain 
their own websites 116 which are either informative and provide downloading of forms and other 
documents or also support user interaction. The development of  " Citizen Centric "  web-enabled systems, which has evolved as part of the 
Information Systems Strategy, is an ongoing process. Currently, a considerable number of 
e-services, such as the electronic submission of tax returns, the road tax license renewal using 
credit cards, the payment of social contributions for employees or for the self-employed using the 
 " direct debit "  payment method, etc., are provided to the public by the Government. In the Czech Republic, the Public Administration Portal 117 has been in operation since 2004. It 
serves as a single gateway between the public administration and citizens, businesses and 
institutions. The Portal includes a full public administration directory, Czech and European 
legislation, a database of detailed, suggested solutions for over 300 specific transactions with the 
authorities, the electronic Commercial Register, a facility for viewing parts of the Land Register, a 
public procurement overview and news from individual departments, etc. Certain online services are available to citizens via the Public Administration Portal, including: 
filing of tax returns, applications for social benefits and services related to public healthcare. For 
companies, the services include: filing of statements related to social and health insurance of 
employees, filing of tax returns, filing of excise duty declarations, simplification of online 
completion and filing of statistical reports or electronic customs declarations. Central public administration in Hungary is fully covered by computer systems, with a network 
access rate of almost 70% and the majority of ministries having their own home pages. In 1998, 
the so-called 'one-stop-shop' IT systems were created for the registration of sole proprietors and 
economic associations 118 . The modernisation of the Internet portal of the Ministry for Justice 
involved the creation of a forum for recommendations and feedback concerning the problems of 
lawmaking. In Malta IT tools were developed with a view to increasing administrative efficiency and 
simplifying procedures. For example, a common database was set up to ensure that whenever 116 In order to promote e-inclusion, public web pages are developed on the basis of the Web Accessibility Guidelines. 117 www.portal.gov.cz. 118 Administrative Simplification – Best Practices in Hungary, Submission by the Hungarian government, Public Management 
Committee, 18-19 October 2001, Administrative Simplification – Best practices in OECD Countries, Expert Seminar. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 72 information contained in a public database is amended, this change will also be made in all public 
databases. In the Slovak Republic, e-government is developing but is at the 'start up' phase. Some 
initiatives have been taken recently, including those to simplify business registration. Standard 
forms can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Justice. The registration is complete 
within five days, once the requested documents and the completed form have been provided by 
a company. In Slovenia, the portal, e-government 119 , was launched on 22 May 2006. It is an access point to 
public administration information and services which lists information in groups of life events. The 
portal provides easy access to information as well as user-friendly use of services offered by the 
state. The modernised portal includes a more comprehensive list of civil servants to whom a 
citizen can submit an application and it enables the citizen to communicate with public 
administration bodies, which ensures a quick response and user-friendly information. For 
example, it is possible to renew a driving licence online, thanks to the state portal e-government. The Ministry of Public Administration hosts a state portal for businesses called e-VEM 120 , which 
was launched on 1 July 2006. It enables the prospective sole trader to register in the Slovenian 
Business Register and forwards the information to the Tax Administration. It is planed to expand 
the e-VEM system to facilitate the registration of other types of companies. Development of a More Citizen-friendly Administration In many NMS, initiatives to develop a more citizen-friendly administration have been 
implemented, including the establishment of a quality service charter or a focus on some 
administrative principles of law. In Malta, the Office of the Prime Minister developed a model of Quality Service Charter that 
ministries may adopt on a voluntary basis and adapt to their specific fields of activity in order to 
ensure that citizens are served as quickly as possible. Some principles of administrative law may help to reduce administrative burdens. The Estonian 
Administrative Procedures Act requires the Estonian public service to provide administrative 
procedures that are efficient and provided with the least cost and delay to users 121 . Dialogue with Stakeholders Committed to the Reduction of Administrative Burden In some countries, coordination between authorities and all stakeholders involved regarding the 
reduction of administrative burden was strengthened through the establishment of a working 
group specifically in charge of these issues. In Lithuania, a Standing Committee for Business Environment Improvement 122 was established 
by the Prime Minister, involving representatives of business institutions, independent experts, 
specialists of state institutions, science and education institutions. The committee aims at the 
simplification of the business environment and its working method is based on close cooperation 
between authorities and business organizations. However, in other countries, such as the Slovak Republic, there is no coordinated exchange of 
information between public service bodies. There is no central point such as a 'one-stop-shop' to 119 http://uprava.gov.si/e-uprava/. 120 http://evem.gov.si. 121 Administrative Procedures Act, Article 5 II. 122 Resolution No 1265 'On Establishing a Standing Committee for Business Environment Improvement', Official Gazette No

and registration processes required by public service bodies. Accessibility It is essential for the good governance of a country that laws enacted to bind individuals and 
corporate people should be accessible to them and their advisers. This means that not only 
should they be able to find the laws but when they find them they should be able to follow them 
easily without having to refer from one text to another in a paper trail of cross-cutting 
amendments and overlapping requirements. Developments in Information Technology have 
aided considerably the process of making legislation and other official information available 
electronically and most countries now have some form of web-based access to legislation. Publication in the Official Gazette and on the Internet In all countries, primary and secondary regulation must be published in the Official Gazette in 
paper texts and in most countries it is also accessible online. Of particular interest is that in 
Estonia and Malta both versions (paper and electronic) have the same legal force. In Estonia, if 
the electronic version and the paper version of the same legislation published contradict each 
other, the paper version prevails and the State Chancellery must be notified of the contradiction. In all other NMS, except in Cyprus, the internet version of legislation is free of charge. In most 
NMS, there is a slight delay between the publication of legislation on the internet and the 
publication on paper. However, in Estonia, legislation and other documents are published in the 
electronic Riigi Teataja at the same time as the Riigi Teataja (Official Gazette) is published on 
paper. In Lithuania, all legislation must be published on the website of the parliament or the website of 
the institution which adopted it, within three days of its official publication in the Official Gazette. Official Journal websites are maintained by various ministries in the NMS. The Ministry of Justice 
(Hungary, Malta, and the Slovak Republic) or the State Chancellery (Estonia, Latvia) is 
responsible for publishing the Official Gazette, including its publication on the internet. In the Czech Republic, there is a searchable database of legislation available free of charge on 
the Public Administration Portal 123 . The scanned issues of the Official Gazette can also be 
downloaded free of charge from the website of the Ministry of the Interior 124 . The same website 
provides a similar search in the database of international treaties. In Cyprus, internet accessibility is possible through several other websites such as Leginet 125 , 
which is a vast database of legal materials such as titles of laws and regulations as well as the 
full text of laws. In Cyprus, also, an index of Primary Legislation (Titles of Laws and Regulations) 
is published in the Gazette. The House of Representatives' website includes indexes to all 
legislation in the form of yearly volumes. In addition, the Law Commissioner's Office drew up an 
index for international treaties called 'Index of International Treaties 1960 – 2004. In Latvia, all EC Directives and Regulations may also be found on the webpage of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Centre of Terminology. In Lithuania when legislation is amended, an unofficial text of the legislation is published which 
sets out the original text as amended. 123 http://portal.gov.cz/wps/portal/_s.155/699. 124 http://www.mvcr.cz/sbirka/index.html. 125 www.leginetcy.com. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 74 In Malta, the Department of Information, within the Office of the Prime Minister, is responsible for 
publishing the Government Gazette, including its publication on the internet. All subsidiary 
legislation, including bye-laws, is available on the Department of Information website 126 . In 
Cyprus and Lithuania, a database of regulations is available on the Parliament's website. In Poland, every year, starting from 31 March, an index of all regulations published in the official 
journal in a given year will be issued. In some countries, in addition to the text of the laws, indexes of titles of laws and regulations are 
published. In Lithuania, public institutions publish titles of regulations in force within the sphere 
of their competence with respective references to relevant versions of regulations that are 
available in the database of regulations of the parliament. Access to Consolidated Versions In Estonia, since 2006, consolidated versions of legislation are published at the same time as 
the publication of an amending Act. After amendment or repeal of a piece of legislation, a consolidated text of this piece of legislation, 
setting out all the amendments made to the original text, is prepared and published electronically 
in the Riigi Teataja (the State Gazette). All legislation is consolidated in this manner 127 . In Latvia, regulations, once amended, are made available by the Ministry of Justice in an 
annotated form 128 . All regulations are collected in a database (NAIS) partially funded from the 
state budget and partially from subscriptions from selling the annotation service. It is planned to 
make this database available to the public free of charge and to link regulations with annotations 
and related materials. In Malta, when legislation has been amended, it is re-published with the amendments in place. 
The website of the Ministry of Justice is regularly updated to include any recent amendments. In the Slovak Republic, there is a Central Register of Laws website 129 where it is possible to 
read laws that have been amended as a single text, in consolidated form. In Slovenia, the parliament publishes a consolidated text of legislation, once a principal Act in a 
series of Acts is amended. The consolidated text is not re-enacted but it is accepted as an official 
version of the legislation and as evidence of its contents. Publication of Court Decisions In Cyprus and Estonia, a database of court statistics and court decisions will soon be made 
available to the public. In Cyprus, a web-enabled system is scheduled to be developed under the Ministry of Justice and 
Public Order. Once completed, the system will give access to all judgments, laws, regulations 
and other legal material to judges, lawyers, government officers, other external bodies and the 
public. In Estonia, all Supreme Court decisions are available in the State Gazette, on paper, and on the 
homepage of the Supreme Court. In addition, a database (the 'KOLA'), in use since 2001, is 126 www.doi.gov.mt. 127 1) Acts of laws; 2) decrees of the President of the Republic; 3) regulations and orders of the Government of the Republic; 4) 
regulations of ministers; 5) regulations of the President of the Bank of Estonia; 6) regulations of the National Electoral 
Committee. 128 The compilation of the materials is undertaken by one official in the Ministry of Justice but the annotation work is undertaken 
by a private sector firm. The texts are not fully consolidated in the normal sense of the word but are annotated with links to 
enable the reader to follow easily a text that has been amended on a number of occasions. 129 www.zbierka.sk. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 75 divided into parts accessible to the public. Statistical returns related to judicial proceedings are 
also accessible to the public. The authorised users of the 'KOLA' have access to all the courts of 
the Estonia. The courts enter in the 'KOLA' notice of all court proceedings before them. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 76 5.

The structure for enacting primary legislation.

Thee procedures for enacting primary legislation 
@BULLET 
The question of when parliament initiates legislation – does it follow the same processes 
of policy debate and law drafting as is followed by the extensive branch of government. 
@BULLET 
The resources available to parliament to enable members of parliament to research 
issues arising in legislation. 
@BULLET 
The outputs of parliament and to what extent does the legislature indicate legislation 
independently of the executive branch of government. Structures for Enacting Primary Legislation Generally, parliaments are only concerned with primary legislation; however, the House of 
Representatives in Cyprus also discusses secondary legislation, in detail. The majority of parliaments in the NMS are unicameral, as can be seen from the table below. 
The question of whether there should be one or two legislative chambers is one of the most 
frequently asked questions of parliamentary design 130 . The procedures for debate vary from NMS 
to NMS, though they all follow a broadly similar pattern of three readings. Bicameral parliaments are to be found in Poland and the Slovak Republic. A further variation 
on this theme is Slovenia and, to some extent the Czech Republic, which have an incomplete 
bi-cameral structure. This means that the upper chamber does not have equal competencies with 
the lower chamber and has less authority. The purpose of upper chambers in incomplete 
bi-cameral systems, which on a world scale are more common than complete bi-cameral 
systems, is to supervise the work of the lower chamber. As may be seen from the table below, terms of office vary. Representatives serve for four (Baltic 
countries, National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia) or five-year terms, (Malta, Cyprus, 
National Council of the Republic of Slovenia). The number of representatives varies widely 
from country to country. 130 Gallagher, Laver and Mair, McGraw Hill (2006), Representative Government in Modern Europe. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 77 Overview of Parliaments in NMS Name of the

debating Bills. It would require a very detailed analysis of the progress of a particular Bill, across 
all the parliaments, to form a view as to whether one procedure is more efficient than another. A 
feature in common is that Bills are reviewed in three readings in all NMS. The complex 
procedures allow time for issues to be considered and it is unlikely that a Bill will be enacted by 
any of these parliaments without a high degree of scrutiny. Some parliaments have, and make 
full use of, accelerated procedures 131 . What follows is an overview, which illustrates the 
complexity of the process and underlines the need for NMS to keep their procedures under 
review. They should ask themselves at some point: @BULLET 
Why are these systems so different? 
@BULLET 
What purpose is served by the different procedures? 
@BULLET 
Could laws be debated and enacted in a more efficient and effective manner? First Reading The first 'reading' in all NMS is the submission of the draft law to the parliament. However, in 
Slovenia, the first reading may be avoided and it takes place only if requested by at least 10 
members of parliament (deputies) (out of 90). In Malta the introduction of a Bill is based on a motion requesting "that leave be given to bring in 
such a Bill". The first reading is, therefore, a formal approval of the title of the Bill. In other countries, the first reading may be for the purpose of designating a committee to take 
charge of a Bill (Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic). Second Reading The second reading in Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary and Latvia, is initiated by the presentation of 
a report made by the committee in charge of studying the Bill. The role of the committee at this 
stage is to focus on the general principles of the Bill. In the Czech Republic, Lithuania, and the 
Slovak Republic, the second reading initiates a more detailed deliberation, section by section, 
on the basis of the report of the committee in charge. In the Slovak Republic, the National Council may only debate a Bill in the second reading after 
at least 48 hours have elapsed from the time the report of the committee established to consider 
the Bill was delivered. In Malta, when a day is fixed for the second reading of a Bill, the Clerk of 
the House gives each Member of the House a printed copy and causes it to be published in the 
Malta Government Gazette. In Slovenia, at the second reading stage, the working body of the National Assembly responsible 
debates the Bill, article by article, before it is debated by the National Assembly as a whole. Proposed amendments may then be considered at the second reading stage (Czech Republic, 
Estonia, and Hungary). In Estonia, after the close of the first reading, members of the Riigikogu 
can submit motions to amend to the leading committee. If that committee accepts a proposed 
amendment, it is put to a vote. The second reading of a draft may be suspended to leave 
additional time for improving the draft law and submitting motions to amend. 131 In some countries, such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Slovak Republic, the Standing Order of the Parliament 
establishes a so-called accelerated legislative procedure, according to which the timing of the enactment procedure is 
reduced, usually through the reduction of the number of compulsory readings. For example, in the Slovak Republic, all three 
necessary readings take place during a single plenary session. 
The excessive use of such procedures, as is pointed out by the National Council of the Slovak Republic, may reflect a lack of 
adequate preparation on the part of the government or a less than efficient working on the part of the parliament. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 79 Between the second and third reading, in the Czech Republic and Poland, a Bill or draft 
resolution may be returned to the committees which considered it in the event of new 
amendments and motions being introduced during the second reading. In the Czech Republic, a 
detailed parliamentary debate is held on specific provisions of the draft and proposed 
amendments when the Chamber of Deputies has decided not to return a draft to a committee for 
further debate. In Poland, committees may present to the Sejm an additional report in which they 
may propose adoption or rejection of the Bill as a whole. Third Reading In Cyprus, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia, amendments may be 
considered, following the third reading. In Malta, only verbal amendments may be made to any 
law on the third reading. In the Slovak Republic, the third reading is restricted only to those 
provisions to which altering or amending proposals have been approved in the second reading. A 
Deputy may only propose, in the third reading, an amendment of legislative-technical 
irregularities and grammatical errors. At the third reading stage in all NMS, the draft is debated 
for the last time; once the debates are closed, the draft law is put to a final vote. In Slovenia, amendments may be tabled to those articles to which amendments have been 
adopted in the second reading. The government may propose an amendment, provided it did not 
propose the Bill debated. The government or the member proposing the Bill may propose 
amendments to those amendments but not to the original text proposed. Vote by the Other Assembly in the Case of a Bicameral Parliament In the case of a bicameral parliament, such as in the Czech Republic and Poland, once the 
draft Bill has been adopted by one assembly, it is submitted to the other assembly which may 
approve of, reject or amend the Bill. In the two latter cases, the Bill is returned to the assembly 
which first discussed it and there is a procedure to ensure that a consensus is achieved, 
eventually, between the two assemblies. In the Czech Republic, senators may attend a sitting of the Chamber of Deputies and justify the 
ruling of the Senate where a Bill has been returned with proposed amendments or if a Bill has 
been rejected. In Poland, the Senate, within 30 days of submission of a Bill, may adopt it without amendment, 
adopt amendments or resolve upon its complete rejection 132 . If, within 30 days following the 
submission of the Bill to the Assembly, the Senate fails to adopt an appropriate resolution, the Bill 
is considered adopted according to the wording submitted by the Sejm. A similar procedure 
exists in the Czech Republic. Initiation by Members of Parliament of Bills and Amendments When members of parliament initiate legislation or propose amendments, it is essential that they 
do so with the same attention to technical detail, as is the case with a Bill or amendment 
prepared by a member of government with the technical assistance of his or her officials. To do 
otherwise can result in inadequate laws being proposed and in the quality of legislation being 
damaged by poorly thought out amendments. In order to review the extent to which Better Regulation principles are embedded in a country, it 
is important to consider whether proposals by members of parliament are subjected to the same 
processes of policy analysis and law drafting as those followed in the executive branch of 
government. 132 Article 121 of the Constitution. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 80 In some NMS, efforts are made to safeguard the integrity of the outputs of parliament by ensuring 
that proposals for Bills and amendments suggested by members of parliament are subject to a 
detailed analytical review, outside the partisan debates in the chamber of the parliament. In certain countries (Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Slovak Republic), Bills initiated by 
members of parliament should be submitted to the government, for observations. In some 
countries, Bills are accompanied by an explanatory paper (Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Slovak 
Republic and Slovenia) in the same way as government Bills. In Lithuania, a draft law must be sent to the European Law Department in the Ministry of Justice 
for evaluation of its consistency with European Union Law. The government, if consulted, is only 
entitled to give a conclusion and propose amendments. Amendments may not be made to a draft 
law, without the consent of a working group of the parliament. In the Slovak Republic, a proposal by parliament is forwarded by the chairperson of the 
National Council to the Government for opinion. It is discussed within the Legislative Council and 
presented to the government by the minister in whose field of competence the proposal falls. If 
the government does not take a position on the proposal within a 30-day period, the proposal is 
discussed by the National Council and, in any case, the position of the government is only of 
recommendatory character. In Slovenia, Bills submitted to parliament must be accompanied by documentation that states 
whether or not impact assessments and consultations have been undertaken and the secretariat 
of the parliament may reject a Bill which is not accompanied by at least a notional impact 
assessment. The quality of these impact assessments is not reviewed by the secretariat so, 
inevitably, the quality of the assessments is variable. Rules of Procedure Coherent and efficient rules on the organisation of plenary debates are a major factor in ensuring 
the quality of parliamentary debates and, therefore, the quality of parliamentary outputs and laws 
enacted. In particular, efforts are made through the committee system to place greater emphasis 
on the work of parliamentary standing committees in order to reserve plenary sessions for 
debates on major issues. The standing orders or rules of procedure usually represent the main source of the rules 
regulating the order, timing and organisation of plenary debates, as well as the quorum. 
However, the Constitution may also contain essential provisions in this regard, as it is the case in 
Cyprus. In all NMS, the standing orders establish organs, such as a chairperson and a board, which 
ensures the logistical organisation of the parliamentary debates. In the Czech Republic, the coordination of the work of the Chamber of Deputies rests with the 
chairperson and the deputy chairperson. The chairperson of the Chamber of Deputies is 
represented by deputy chairpersons on his or her command, or in the order which has been 
specified. Relative Positions of Legislature by Executive Branch of Government The relations between the members of the executive branch of government and the parliament 
are ruled either by the Constitution, the rules of procedures of the parliament, or inter-institutional 
agreements. Two distinct patterns may be seen in the NMS. The first is where the executive branch of 
government dominates the legislature (Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta). The 
second is where the legislative branch plays a more active role. In the Czech Republic, GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 81 Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic, parliaments have a more independent approach to 
handling the executive branch of government. This may have adverse consequences for the 
quality of the resulting legislation, as the government does not exercise much control over 
amendments introduced at the enactment stage. Slovenia lies somewhere in between these two 
positions as its parliament is independent but respectful of the needs of the executive branch of 
government. Positive Trend In a few NMS, inter-institutional agreements have been signed between the government and the 
parliament in order to enhance the efficiency of the enactment process. In Poland, the 2004 Law 
on Cooperation of the Council of Ministers with the Sejm and Senate on matters relating to 
membership of the EU include provisions on the timely enactment of drafts transposing EU Laws. 
However, the coordination between these two constitutional bodies only refers to EU-related 
issues and does not cover other areas. In Slovenia, the cooperation of the government and national assembly on EU affairs is governed 
by the Act on Cooperation between the National Assembly and the Government in EU Affairs 133 , 
which stipulates that they cooperate in preparing positions and comments in cases where, in a 
comparable national situation, a document would be elaborated on in the National Assembly. In 
other cases, the government informs the National Assembly of developments. Resources Available to Parliament Parliaments are relatively well-served by research facilities and researchers. In most countries 
(Cyprus, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic), each member of parliament 
has a parliamentary assistant who holds a University degree. In Slovenia, the National Assembly provides each deputy group with a secretary, two specialised 
staff members and a clerk; an additional clerk is provided for every group of eight deputies; a 
group having more than eight deputies is provided with an additional specialised staff member. Members of parliament may also have access to libraries and to a comprehensive database, 
including access to the complete, updated legislation, as it is the case in Malta and Lithuania. In 
the latter NMS, since 1997, this database has been extended by a new sub-system providing 
Lithuanian translations of all the EU regulations. In the Slovak Republic, the Parliamentary Library provides the members of the National Council 
with books, periodicals and other documents, and provides research and reference services, 
thematically expert searches and creates an automated database of books, periodicals and 
articles from selected periodicals 134 . In the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Hungary and the Slovak Republic, members 
of parliament may also benefit from services provided by parliamentary support staff assigned to 
committees, or to specific support units. In addition to the information provided by parliamentary 
support staff, members of parliament, as is the case in Cyprus, may visit parliaments in other 
countries in order to share experiences. Whatever their size may be, support units seem to be essential as their analysis and activities 
enable the parliament to control the quality of Bills. In addition, in some NMS, they assist 
members of parliament to draft proposals or amendments, as well as to review government Bills. 133 Official Gazette of RS, No. 34/2004. 134 For example, the Slovak Parliamentary Digital Library, which contains electronic documents of all parliaments that have 
existed on the territory of the Slovak and Czech Republic since 1848. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 82 In Estonia, the Parliament has adhered to the same technical rules on drafting as the 
government, which include the necessity to examine a list of impacts that need to be assessed 
when drafting legislation; and the support staff may assist members of parliament in conducting 
these assessments. In Lithuania, the Information Analysis Department at the Office of Parliament provides 
comparative analysis and interpretation of regulations of foreign states, analysis of regulatory 
practice in various fields and any information requested by members of parliament. The 
Department often contributes to the reasoning provided by the Legal Department of the 
Parliament, when the latter carries out the analysis and interpretation of Lithuanian regulations. In Poland, the Chancellery of the Sejm includes, in addition to the Sejm Library, the Office for 
Research which is responsible for providing legal, social and economic analysis for the legislation 
process, and the Office for Legislation, which participates in committee work and assists 
members of the Sejm by drafting Bills and amendments. All parliaments in NMS appear to fall short of the expertise available to governments. In 
Hungary, the Office of the Parliament has 660 staff; the number of support staff varies but is 
usually relatively limited. Only 15 officials are involved in the administration of the Parliament in 
Cyprus, of which only a few have research competencies. The same number of staff is employed 
at the Parliamentary Institute in the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, there are a number of problems with legislation relating to the lack of 
quality of amendments proposed to legislation and to the lack of discipline in the management of 
legislation. Many amendments proposed do not take full account of the scope and intention of the 
legislation or refer to a matter that is not covered at all by the draft law discussed. If enacted, 
these amendments distort badly the sense of the Bill to which the amendments are proposed and 
make the resulting law difficult to apply. In Slovenia, the review of laws carried out by the legislative and legal service is purely formal 
and does not address the substance of the proposal. In addition, it appears to duplicate the 
review that is carried out by the Secretariat General of the Government. Outputs In all NMS, members of parliament may propose legislation. In Cyprus, by virtue of the 
Constitution, a member of the House of Representatives may propose a law, provided it does not 
burden the state budget. In a number of NMS, Bills may be proposed as a result of a petition of a number of citizens. In 
Lithuania, for example, 50 000 citizens may submit a draft law to the parliament. In Poland, 
100 000, and in Slovenia, five thousand or more voters may introduce a legislative proposal. In practice, and in general, in the NMS studied, the majority of the laws debated and enacted are 
introduced by the Government and very few draft laws proposed by members of the parliament, 
or by any other person or body, are passed. The number of Bills proposed by opposition parties represents a very small percentage of the 
total of Bills submitted to parliament. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 83 Country

GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 86 Much of the work of parliaments in NMS has been devoted in recent years to the implementation 
of European Union legislation and, in this regard, their output has been considerable. However, the quality of the work undertaken in such a short period of time and under such 
intense pressure is being questioned. In many NMS, domestic issues were almost entirely left 
aside and what is needed now is a period of reflection and review. In many NMS, officials and 
representatives from businesses and NGOs stressed the need for parliaments to slow the pace 
and concentrate more on quality rather than quantity. Reports and Public Inquiries Parliamentary committees have the right to invite cabinet members to their meetings and to ask 
them for explanations, reports and necessary documents; they are under an obligation to attend 
a committee meeting, provide requisite explanations and reports and present documents. Bills are usually discussed in committees at the first stages of the enactment process as, in most 
countries, except in Malta where debates on the Bill sections in plenary sessions are held on the 
basis of the comments provided by the relevant committee. Although the powers of parliamentary 
committees may vary from one NMS to another, committees usually have the right to consider 
fully the Bill submitted. In Lithuania, the scope and importance of the parliamentary committees has increased 
significantly following the adoption of the 1999 Statute of the Parliament 152 . In all NMS, committees may require that members of the government or the administration 
provide more information. In addition, debates at committee stage usually involve consultations 
with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives of civil society and experts. In most NMS, the parliament and parliamentary committees have the right to submit to the prime 
minister or to an individual minister questions and requests for further documents for which the 
latter is responsible (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic 
and Slovenia). A particular feature of the enactment process in Cyprus and Latvia consists in the fact that, not 
only ministers, but also officials are called before committees of the parliament and are required 
explaining policy decisions. In Cyprus, the Czech Republic (Senate), Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, committees or even 
the parliament may invite not only the representatives of the government but also all the 
interested parties to present their opinion. However, procedures organising public hearings are 
very often neither fixed nor systematically used. In Lithuania, following the 1999 Statute of the Parliament 153 , the committee concerned sends the 
Bill to all interested state institutions and, if necessary, to public organisations, self-governments, 
political parties and organisations. The period allowed for consultation is longer than that allowed 
for government consultations. However, there appears to be no fixed rule on this issue. In Latvia, NGOs may attend plenary sessions and parliamentary committee meetings. However, 
NGOs with only a sporadic interest in an individual piece of legislation do run into difficulties of 
access, such as the inability to secure a pass to enter parliamentary buildings. In addition, the 
parliament has, only on rare occasions, held hearings in order to solicit the views of the NGO 
community. 152 Entered into force on 1 February 1999. 153 1 February 1999. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 87 In Poland, a public hearing may be held on a Bill, providing that a resolution referring the Bill to a 
committee for consideration is passed by the committee. Limited Capacity for Independent Inquiry In most NMS, the capacity of parliaments to conduct independent inquiry remains limited. In 
Hungary, no public inquiries are held by the parliament. In some NMS, e.g., the Czech Republic 
(Chamber of Deputies), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia, select or investigatory 
committees may be appointed by the parliament. In Lithuania, for resolving short-term or limited assignments, the Seimas may form standing 
commissions to examine special problems or to form ad hoc investigatory, control, revision, 
preparatory, editorial and other commissions to examine and prepare, or fulfill, another mission of 
the Seimas. In practice, some duplication appears to exist between parliamentary committees 
and commissions. In Slovenia, the National Assembly may order inquiries on matters of public importance when 
required by a third of the deputies of the National Assembly or when required by the National 
Council. For this purpose, it appoints a commission which, for the purpose of investigations and 
examinations, has powers comparable to those of a judge. The National Assembly has 
conducted several parliamentary ad hoc inquiries, including one recent inquiry on company 
mergers. In general, parliaments are addressed, and reports made, by various bodies which conduct 
inquiries in their own field of competence. For example, in Hungary, the State Audit Office 154 and 
the Hungarian Atomic Energy Committee report annually, to parliament. 154 http://www.asz.hu/ASZ/www.nsf/AMain?Openframeset. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 88 6. 
ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE This part deals with enforcement and compliance in relation to intellectual property law and 
environmental protection law. Enforcement and compliance are central to effective regulatory management. It would require an 
extensive study to assess the extent to which all legislation in a NMS was enforced or complied 
with. Two areas of law (environment law and intellectual property law) were selected as 
indicators of some general trends. The areas were selected in view of their importance to NMS 
and their economies and because their operation extended over a spread of administrative, civil 
and criminal enforcement and compliance tools. There was widespread recognition in all NMS that effective enforcement depends on adequate 
structures being put in place to achieve it and adequate incentives being put in place to achieve 
compliance. The assessments sought to establish, as regards environment law and intellectual property law: @BULLET 
What are the general approaches to, or philosophies of, enforcement and compliance, 
@BULLET 
Were policies in place for enforcement of, and compliance with, legislation in these fields 
adequately funded? 
@BULLET 
Were there any trends towards higher levels of enforcement or compliance? 
@BULLET 
What procedures were in place to enable citizens to appeal against administrative or 
judicial decisions? The General Approach to, or Philosophy of, Enforcement and Compliance In all NMS, the stated philosophy was zero tolerance. There was no mention in any country of a 
philosophy of a risk-based, proportionate model of regulation. In view of the limited resources in 
all NMS, the quality of the enforcement and the attention to techniques in compliance vary 
widely, without any discernible patterns, across the ten NMS. A number of countries have developed administrative penalties. Administrative Penalties An administrative penalty arises where a law enforcement officer, in the course of inspection, 
identifies a contravention of a law. He, or she, may request that the infringement be remedied 
within a specified time or that a fine be paid on the spot. In some cases, an infringement may be 
remedied by the undertaking of work by a third party, with the cost of the work undertaken being 
recovered from the person committing the offence. There is a trend in Estonia, for example, to prefer administrative remedies to penal sanctions, 
particularly after the improved procedures introduced in the Substitutive Enforcement and 
Penalty Payment Act. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 89 An administrative penalty under that Act may be applied if a requirement of an administrative 
authority is not complied with during the term indicated on a warning notice. An administrative 
penalty is considered by officials in Estonia to be more efficient than a penal sanction in 
achieving compliance with environmental laws. A similar approach is adopted in the Czech 
Republic and Slovenia, according to officials in these NMS. Administrative penalties are also 
used in Cyprus. Officials in these NMS agree that this approach is more demanding, in terms of time and energy, 
and runs a higher risk of being susceptible to corruption. However, officials interviewed were 
strongly of the view that requiring people who have breached laws to take action to address the 
problems caused is, ultimately, more effective than a criminal prosecution, where outcomes can 
be uncertain. The documenting of enforcement and compliance success varies from one NMS to another. In 
some, information in this field is more transparent than in others. In Malta, reports published by the Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) set out priorities 
of the subsequent years. For example, the Enforcement Complaints and Compliance Section 
(ECCS) 155 prioritises removing large quantities of signs and billboards that were placed without 
permission and were unsightly. Priority was also given to cleaning up or removing scrap yards, 
and hundreds of tons of rubble and scrap material were deposited in facilities for recycling. In Poland, for example, the Chief Inspector for Environmental Protection publishes an annual 
report entitled 'General Directions in Activities of Environmental Protection Inspection'. The report 
sets out priorities for enforcement activities, e.g., inspections on types of business activities or 
different types of legislation to be prioritised for inspections. On the basis of this report, each 
Voivodship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection prepares a detailed annual enforcement 
plan. Similar information is available (but is unpublished) in Slovenia and the Inspectorate for 
Environment and Spatial Planning has an annual plan prioritising areas for targeted surveillance 
and enforcement of particular legislation. Are policies in place for enforcement of, and compliance with, environmental legislation 
and are intellectual property rights adequately funded and resourced? All NMS indicated difficulties with having enough resources to deal with all contraventions. 
Particular difficulties were reported in Cyprus and Slovenia. In the former, officials in the Ministry 
of the Environment indicated that substantial energies and resources had been put into 
incorporating the acquis communautaire into Cyprus law, leaving little human or financial 
resources for inspections and enforcement 156 . In Lithuania, statistical data on the numbers of inspectors does not enable a complete picture to 
be drawn of the capacity of the administration to enforce all of the legislation. However, 
comments by officials in the field of environment law suggested that some capacity building will 
be necessary to bring the numbers of inspectors up to full strength. Many of the wrongful consequences of breaches of intellectual property law are, however, 
identified by commercial bodies whose interests are directly affected by breaches. These bodies 
often have the resources to take civil actions. In some types of action, such as actions against 
breaches of copyright, persons not well placed to take legal action may benefit from involvement 
with collection societies, who are better placed to take collective action on behalf of their 
members. 155 See Malta Environment and Planning Authority (2005), Annual report, p. 36 www.mepa.org.mt. 156 In Cyprus, the Registrar of Companies also has responsibilites for intellectual property enforcement but the office has no 
capacity to develop its own database to be able to assess levels of compliance, from year to year. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 90 Are there any Trends towards Higher Levels of Enforcement or Compliance? All NMS reported improvements in enforcement. Reports from environmental protection bodies 
provide some data but comparisons are difficult, as data is collected for different reasons in 
different NMS. Enforcement performance may differ within an individual NMS, depending on the sector 
considered, may derive from the fact that enforcement mechanisms are usually not standardised 
within a NMS. In the Czech Republic, a report prepared by the Ministry of the Interior, reviewing all inspection 
arrangements for a wide range of laws, identified shortcomings of the legislation on inspection, 
including overlapping mechanisms and inconsistencies of terminology used. Currently, several 
hundreds Acts regulate the inspection procedures carried out by public administration authorities. 
The Ministry of the Interior launched a project to simplify and unify the system of control in the 
Czech Republic and to increase its transparency for the general public. This should be achieved 
through the adoption of a unique regulation which would replace all the existing regulations. The 
Ministry of the Interior is preparing a substantial proposal for the above-mentioned act and plans 
to submit it to the Government in April 2007. In Lithuania, comments from industry sources suggest difficulties in the interpretation of some 
environmental regulations, In Malta, each Ministry or enforcing body may have its own mechanism to ensure compliance 
with laws. This may not be automatically detrimental to the level of enforcement; however, it may 
contribute to its reduction. Weak enforcement may also be linked to the fact that enforcement authorities are granted 
insufficient, or inappropriate, powers. In this regard, the situation varies from one NMS to the 
other. Barriers to enforcement may result from the law itself or the way it is applied and interpreted. In 
Cyprus, the interpretation by the judiciary of burden-of-proof rules as to copyright ownership 
makes the initiation of legal proceedings against infringers very difficult. Annual Reports The documenting of enforcement and compliance success varies from one NMS to another. In Malta, the Environment and Planning Authority reports that the Enforcement Complaints and 
Compliance Section (ECCS) 157 dealt with 3705 complaints in the period covered by the 2005 
Report. Of these complaints, 3524 were replied to and, from these, 391 cases were resolved 
without need for an enforcement action. The ECCS monitored building developments so that 
infringements could be acted on at the construction stage of building projects. In a small number 
of cases, prosecutions were necessary but, in the majority of cases, a visit from the ECCS was 
sufficient to address problems. In Poland, the annual report of the Chief Inspector for the Environment provides some 
information about enforcement, including the number of companies inspected in a particular year, 
the number of inspections and the number of decisions taken suspending the operation of an 
installation, due to infringements by that installation of environmental law. Watch Lists One definite objective measure of improvement may be gleaned from the Office of the United 
States Trade Representative. It publishes an annual report on intellectual property compliance, 157 See annual report for Malta Environment and Planning Report and Accounts 2005 p. 36 [www.mepa.org.mt]. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 91 which includes a priority Watch List. There is a second list the Watch List of countries that do not 
provide an adequate level of IPR protection or enforcement, or market access for persons relying 
on intellectual property protection 158 . The Slovak Republic was dropped from this list in 2005. However, some NMS remain on the list. Hungary remained on the Watch List for 2006, despite 
the recognition by the U.S. authorities of the recent enactment of intellectual property 
enforcement legislation. There has undoubtedly been progress in this field in Hungary in recent 
years. Hungary was moved from Priority Watch List to Watch List in 2003. Positive steps have 
been taken in Hungary to modernise its copyright code, but poor enforcement of these laws, 
delays in bringing prosecutions, low fines, weak sentences and weak border enforcement remain 
a source of concern acknowledged by the authorities in Hungary. Latvia also remained on the Watch List for 2006, despite the fact that it has improved 
enforcement, among other things, by improving co-ordination between ministries and 
enforcement authorities. There has been an increase in prosecutions, but low fines and prison 
sentences are not acting as a sufficient deterrent to prevent infringements. Border controls 
remain weak and internet piracy remains a problem. Lithuania also remains on the list for 2006. It has improved its legislative framework for 
protecting IPR and in combating software piracy. However, optical media piracy levels remain 
high. Poland also faces challenges from increasing software piracy. It remains on the Watch List for 
2006. There were an increased number of raids in 2005 to seize pirated software but the 
imposition by the courts of low fines and short prison sentences appears not to have created a 
sufficient disincentive to continued infringements. Appeal Processes Enforcement can be delayed by lengthy appeal processes. All NMS have appeals processes in 
place but no effort has been made in any country to provide for accelerated appeal processes in 
cases of exceptional public interest. Delays in court hearings in some countries, notably in Malta, 
the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, need to be addressed by increasing capacity and reviewing 
procedures to ascertain if improvements can be brought about by more streamlined processes. Decisions made by public authorities in the field of environmental law may be challenged in all 
NMS. In many NMS, including, the Czech Republic, Malta, Poland and Slovenia, individuals 
may first request the relevant authority to review the challenged decision before starting an 
appeals procedure before a court. In Poland, decisions relating to intellectual property rights may be appealed either before an 
administrative court or a civil court. The 2000 Law on Industrial Property provides for a right of 
action in an administrative court, where an appeal against a decision of the Patent Office to the 
Regional Administrative Court may be filed. In addition, apart from the rights stipulated in the 
copyright law and the law of industrial property, an injured person is granted the right to file a 
claim for civil rights protection as provided for in the Civil Code. Some NMS have nominated special bodies or procedures to appeal against a decision related to 
intellectual property rights. In the Slovak Republic, where a decision of the Industrial Property 
Office may be challenged, following a two-stage process. In the first stage, objections raised by 
third parties against the recognition of a trade mark are assessed and decided upon by the 158 These reports are prepared under section 182 of the Trade Act 1974 (US) as amended including the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act (1994) ('Special 301). Under special 301 provisions USTR must identify those countries that deny adequate 
and effective protection for IPR or deny equitable and fair market access for persons that rely on intellectual property 
protection. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 92 Office. In the second stage, third parties who object to the decision may lodge an appeal before 
the appeals department of the Office. The final decision is signed by the head of the Office upon 
a decision of an independent Committee consisting of 5 members (3 from the academic world 
and 2 from the appeals department of the Office). Extra-judicial Mechanisms of Recourse All NMS have established extra-judicial mechanisms of recourse, including the establishment of 
ombudsmen and of bodies in charge of consumer claims. Ombudsmen have been established in all NMS and usually have similar responsibilities. In 
Cyprus, for example, citizens may challenge administrative decisions by an appeal to the 
Ombudsman's Office. In addition, mechanisms for dispute resolution, including SOLVIT centres 
and arbitration mechanisms, have been set up in some NMS. In Malta, consumers have an option to go to the Consumer Forum or the Consumer Claims 
Tribunal for purchases made by consumers of up to 1500 Lira. There is scarce data on 
enforcement. However, a survey conducted by the Council of Consumers revealed that many 
decisions delivered by the Consumer Claims Tribunal are not enforced. Also in Malta, mandatory 
arbitration was recently developed for claims of creditors of below 5000 Lira, resulting in an 
important reduction in the number of cases before the courts. Since August 2005, 500 claims 
have been made under such a procedure. In the Slovak Republic, a Law on Mediation was adopted in September 2004. Following the 
2004 amendment of the Act on Bankruptcy, a significant flexibility has been introduced to 
bankruptcy proceedings. In Slovenia, the 2005 National Reform Programme identifies the need to improve the functioning 
of the judicial system. The measures proposed include: simplification of procedures, 
computerisation of courts and the re-organisation of the management of the courts. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 93 7. 
CONCLUSIONS General The NMS reviewed during this study are, geographically, a very diverse group of countries. They 
range from small islands in the Mediterranean to states that have recently moved from central 
planning structures to free market economies. All adopted the acquis communautaire in a 
remarkably short period of time and many have seen accelerated and far reaching changes to 
their systems of governance. Now that they are members of the EU, they all face, to differing 
degrees, the challenge of ensuring that the laws which were adopted as part of the accession 
process are enforced or complied with and that future amendments to the acquis communautaire 
are adopted and implemented in a timely manner. Many NMS face pressing domestic issues, some of which are beyond the remit of the European 
Union. These issues include: balancing expectations of state support for welfare and pension 
policies against the harsh reality of having to fund them from taxation, maintaining 
competitiveness, dealing with the challenges posed by unemployment and emigration of talent 
and addressing the rights of minorities. As regards regulatory management, all of the NMS have transparent and efficient systems for 
planning the execution of policy choices, for the development of policies and their implementation 
into legislation. All have Better Regulation-type policies, with some having an explicit Better 
Regulation policy (Czech Republic, Malta and Poland), while others have an implicit Better 
Regulation policy. Political support is a critical success factor for the development and implementation of improved 
governance practices, such as the adoption of a Better Regulation policy. In some NMS (Cyprus, 
Malta,Poland, Slovenia), political support was clearly visible in the form of participation by 
ministers in conferences on Better Regulation, speaking knowledgeably about the subject. 
However, in the other NMS, political support was less tangible, though references to Better 
Regulation issues may be found in all NMS in strategic plans and political documents of one kind 
or another. These references have to be treated with caution, as many of these documents set 
out ideals and ambitions as much as they set out realistic and deliverable goals. Any policy development in states formerly under communist influence has to take its place 
alongside a large number of other pressing political issues. In the period up to, and immediately 
after, European integration, anything which was associated with accession was likely to be 
prioritised and accelerated. In the post-accession period, it is by no means certain that this will 
remain the case. Regulatory Management Capacity For the most part, in NMS, there is a sense that regulatory management works quite well and 
sophisticated and abstract fine-tuning through the development of Better Regulation is not an 
issue likely to attract voter attention or sustained political interest. It will, therefore, be a challenge 
to sustain interest in it. The reduction of red tape and the reduction of administrative burdens are 
issues that may get some attention, due to their obvious iconic value. However, these issues are 
competing with a wide range of other challenges and, inevitably, require some investment of time 
and money. The argument that Better Regulation policy is an investment in the infrastructure of GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 94 governance requires skilful advocacy and a degree of political vision which is not clearly visible in 
most NMS. The biggest capacity challenge facing all NMS in the development and maintenance of policies to 
improve governance will be to either keep existing officials in place or to develop structures which 
provide for continuity. In all NMS, the fire for regulatory management improvement is kept alive 
by a small number of high priests. If they are promoted, or move on, the challenge will be to put 
in place other officials to deliver on the reforms that were seen being developed during the 
reviews. Quality Control All NMS have put in place regulatory management practices to assure the quality of their 
legislation before it is submitted to government for approval and parliament for enactment. 
However, the practices tend to concentrate exclusively on whether the law has achieved the 
relevant political objectives and on technical, legal issues, such as conformity with the 
Constitution, compliance with the general principles of law and with international obligations. 
These are important goals; however, most NMS neglect to put in place a review from the point of 
view of whether the proposed legislation conforms to Better Regulation principles or whether the 
tools used in their preparation (impact assessment or consultation) have been properly used. 
Some NMS are beginning to address issues associated with ensuring the administrative costs 
are kept to a minimum. Use of Better Regulation Tools In most NMS, there are laws which require impact assessment to be undertaken. However, most 
of these laws were enacted without putting in place the necessary skills or support structures 
and, up until recently; there was no real commitment to their operation. Consequentially, there 
are formal mechanisms in place but they are frequently ignored. A number of NMS (Czech 
Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia) are aware of this problem and 
are addressing it. Enactment All NMS have effective and fully-functioning democratic institutions and many are relatively 
well-resourced. However, in most NMS, the legislative branch of government is dominated by the 
executive. In a few, however (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic), 
parliament plays a dynamic, though not always effective, role in legislating and proposing 
amendments. Enforcement and Compliance Enforcement and compliance is not an area which has received much attention in the context of 
regulatory reform studies or as part of Better Regulation initiatives. As well as providing a general 
overview of enforcement and compliance in these areas in the NMS, the assessments threw up 
some fundamental questions that could be usefully studied in the EU as a whole: @BULLET 
Should the philosophy of enforcement and compliance be zero tolerance, i.e., that every 
offence, no matter how trivial, be prosecuted or should penalty systems be more in the 
line of a risk-based proportionate model of regulation? 
@BULLET 
Are administrative sanctions more effective than penal sanctions and in what 
circumstances are they more effective? 
@BULLET 
What are the most effective sanctions for particular types of offence? 
@BULLET 
What are the best incentives to secure increased levels of compliance? GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 95 @BULLET 
Should statistical data on compliance and enforcement issues be compiled by 
governments in the EU in a manner which facilitates comparisons between EU Member 
States? Recommendations Common to all NMS 1. 
Political support needs to be developed to maintain a policy on Better Regulation Political support is essential for the development of regulatory management capacities so that 
strategic goals are set to achieve good governance by regulating better. Political support needs 
to be more substantive than a few carefully drafted phrases in political manifestoes or national 
plans. It must be genuine and based on a personal commitment of a senior political figure to 
delivering improvements in governance that will ensure that the regulation of their societies and 
economies, and the protection of the environment, is undertaken in a manner which is 
proportionate to the problems experienced, is transparent and deals with issues without having 
unintended consequences. Better Regulation Units can facilitate this process through holding 
seminars and encouraging debate about Better Regulation issues. 2. 
A policy to achieve Better Regulation works best when there are appropriate and 
adequately-funded arrangements in place to support and maintain it Appropriate institutional arrangements need to be put in place to ensure that the quality of 
policy-making and legislation drafting is tested against a set of agreed objective principles 
designed, and agreed to improve, regulatory management. In all NMS, legislation is rigorously 
reviewed from the point of view of legality, constitutionality, and consistency with the general 
principles of law and conformity with international obligations. These are important requirements 
but are not enough to address the complexities of the problems thrown up by the modern world. 
A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to ensure policy choices are well made and, as 
appropriate, expressed in legislative instruments that meet a test of efficiency as well as the 
traditional test of legal effectiveness. 3. 
Regulatory management capacities may be developed through the effective use of 
Better Regulation tools Better regulation tools need to be widely used in a proportionate manner by all institutions 
(executive and legislative branches of government and independent regulators) concerned. The 
issue of proportionality is of particular concern as regards impact assessment. All NMS have 
enacted laws to require the use of impact assessment for all policy proposals. These are most likely to be successful when full impact assessments, using quantitative 
techniques and trained economists, are used for major policy proposals involving substantial 
impacts. For smaller impacts, what is required is an educated sense by officials of what is 
involved and what the likely costs are going to be for a particular proposal. Consultation practices need to be developed to ensure that the collective knowledge of society is 
drawn on, in the development of new laws. Measurement of administrative costs may be undertaken, but it should not be a distraction from 
the wider goals of making legislation as simple as possible and as easy to comply with as 
possible, with the minimum of burdens and duplicated efforts. The use of these tools should facilitate the development of a multi-disciplinary approach to 
policy — making and the slow evolution away from the monopolistic control by lawyers of the 
review of the quality of legislation towards the development of legislation that is not only legally 
effective but efficient. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 96 4. 
Executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate in a 
constructive way to ensure wise governance The executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate in a constructive way to 
ensure wise governance. Legislatures in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Slovak 
Republic tend to make legislative proposals and put forward amendments to legislation that do 
not take into account the longer-term issues. While these are exclusively matters for the NMS 
concerned, it is nevertheless important to draw attention to the need for this cooperation. 5. 
More attention needs to be paid to enforcement and compliance There are substantial developments taking place in the European Union as regards 
administrative costs measurement, simplification and impact assessment. However, the next 
challenge to face the European Union will be to ensure consistent application of European law 
across the EU. The NMS, having recently adopted the acquis communautaire, now face the 
challenge of its effective implementation. How these NMS meet this challenge may well provide 
inspiration and guidance to states that joined the European Union before the 1 st of May 2004, as 
well as to those that will join next. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 97 ANNEX 1: GLOSSARY OF TERMS FOR THE PROJECT TO ASSESS 
REGULATORY CAPACITIES 'acquis' (or acquis communautaire) means in European Union the total body of European Union 
law accumulated so far. When used in the context of enlargement and accession of NMS to the 
Union, the expression refers to the whole corpus of Community law which NMS have to take 
over, including: @BULLET 
The Treaties; 
@BULLET 
The decisions taken by the EU Institutions pursuant to the Treaties; 
@BULLET 
The case law of the Court of Justice. 'Administrative burdens of regulation' means the costs involved in obtaining, reading and 
understanding regulations, developing compliance strategies and meeting mandated reporting 
requirements, including data collection, processing, reporting and storage, but NOT including the 
capital costs of measures taken to comply with the regulations, nor the costs to the public sector 
of administering the regulations. 'Administrative costs' within the EU institutions means the costs incurred by enterprises, the 
voluntary sector, public authorities and citizens in meeting legal obligations to provide information 
on their action or production, either to public authorities or to private parties. Information is to be 
construed in a broad sense, i.e. including costs of labelling, reporting, monitoring and 
assessment needed to provide the information and registration. They are a subset of compliance 
costs stemming from the generic requirements of the legislation, which also includes substantive 
costs one-off investments in new production processes, training or increased recurring costs for 
raw materials and labour (excluding administrative). 'Administrative compliance costs' has the same meaning as administrative burdens of 
regulation. 'Advisory Groups' means selected experts or interested parties (e.g., social partners, 
environmental groups) who are brought together to form a consultative body, either on an ad hoc 
or a standing basis. 'Alternative policy instruments' have the same meaning as regulatory alternatives. 'Alternative to regulations' means any instruments other than command and control regulation 
used with the purpose of obtaining policy goals and including policy instruments such as: @BULLET 
performance based regulation; 
@BULLET 
process regulation; 
@BULLET 
waiver or variance provisions; 
@BULLET 
co-regulation; 
@BULLET 
self-regulation; 
@BULLET 
contractual arrangements; 
@BULLET 
voluntary agreements; GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 98 @BULLET 
tradeable permits; 
@BULLET 
taxes and subsidies; 
@BULLET 
insurance schemes or information campaigns. 'Baseline' is a minimum or starting point for comparisons; in this case, it is a minimum set of 
criteria drawn up by SIGMA, in consultation with the European Commission, for the purpose of 
this project. 'Better Regulation, Regulatory Management, Better Regulation and Smarter Regulation' 
are the terms which are increasingly being used to convey the concept of an ongoing 
commitment to improving the processes of policy formulation, legislative drafting and enhancing 
the overall effectiveness and coherence of regulation. Better Regulation means a policy to improve regulatory management capacities by adopting a 
multidisciplinary approach to formulating policy and drafting regulations and using tools such as 
impact assessment consultation and simplification. It applies to the flow of new regulations and 
the stock of existing regulations. It is closely related to but goes beyond regulatory reform which 
is concerned with reforming regulations so that they operate efficiently. Better Regulation policy 
is designed to ensure that existing and future legislation is of high quality, i.e., that it is clear, 
concise and used only when its burdens are proportionate to its aims. 'Consumer' and 'citizen' are frequently used and it is important to note that these are not 
interchangeable terms. The term 'consumer' is meant to refer to individuals when they are 
participating in the marketplace and consuming particular goods and services. It can also refer to 
businesses, often the initial customers in particular sectors. The concept of a 'citizen' is broader 
and refers to the relationship between individuals and the State (without being used in any strict 
legal sense to denote nationality). There are circumstances where the State is a producer or 
supplier of a particular good or service to citizens. In this context citizens can be viewed as 
consumers of the State 159 . The idea of 'Better Regulation' also helps to draw an important distinction between the wide 
reform agenda and deregulation. It is accepted that in some cases consumer, investor and the 
broader public interest may be better served by introducing new regulation and that in other 
cases it may be better served by removing regulation. No initial assumption is being made about either the existing quality or quantity of regulation or 
the need to deregulate. Instead, it is suggested that the goal of Better Regulation will not be 
achieved by simply seeking to minimise the volume of regulation but rather by using measures 
that are as simple and straightforward as possible while achieving the same policy objectives. 'Capacity' means the ability to perform appropriate tasks effectively, efficiently and 
systematically in a timely manner. 'Circulation of proposals for comment' means the process whereby information on regulatory 
proposals is circulated to a selected group of experts or interested parties for comment. 'Codification' means the systematic arrangement of laws in force. 'Command and Control regulations' means regulations that use the traditional approach of 
imposing a sanction, typically a fine or imprisonment or both, for failure to comply with an 
obligation. 159 See White Paper on Better Regulation (Dublin, 2004) www.betterregulation.irlgov.ie. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 99 'Co-regulation' means a system of shared regulatory responsibilities in which an industry 
association or professional group will assume some regulatory functions, such as surveillance 
and enforcement or setting of regulatory standards. 'EU Better Regulation Policy' includes the 'Action Plan on simplifying and improving the 
regulatory environment,' 160 as part of the European Commission White Paper on European 
Governance 161 and the March 2005 Communication "Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs in 
the European Union 162 ", and the November 2006 Communication  " A strategic review of Better 
Regulation in the European Union "  163 . 'Governance' includes 'rules, processes and behaviour that affect the way in which powers are 
exercised, particularly as regards openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and 
coherence'. The term is used in this document to refer to governance at all levels of government: 
national, local and, at times, at the level of specific economic sectors. 'Legislation' means Acts enacted by a parliament. 'Principles of Better Regulation' includes principles to be applied in the making of regulations 
such as necessity, transparency, proportionality and accessibility. 'Regulatory Management capacity' means the capacity to regulate by means of the formulation 
of policy and its implementation through regulation. 'Regulatory Management policy' means a specific policy on Regulatory Management: that is, a 
policy which has as its object the improvement of regulatory quality and is driven politically and 
by appropriately staffed structures. 'Regulation' means any legal norm and includes an instrument by which governments set 
requirements on enterprises and citizens and includes all laws (primary and secondary), formal 
and informal orders, subordinate rules, administrative formalities and rules issued by 
non-governmental or self-regulatory bodies to whom governments have delegated regulatory 
powers. 'Regulators' means any personnel in government Departments and other agencies responsible 
for making and enforcing regulation. 'Regulatory Impact Analysis/Assessment (RIA)' means the systematic process of 
identification and quantification of economic, social and environmental impacts likely to flow from 
adoption of a proposed regulation or a non-regulatory policy option under consideration. May be 
based on benefit/cost analysis, cost effectiveness analysis, etc. A broader definition of RIA would distinguish between the ex ante RIA which relates to likely 
impacts of a regulatory proposal and the ex post RIA which relates to the actual impacts of an 
existing regulatory measure. 'Regulatory management' means the management of policy-making by a country so as to 
achieve an equitable society, sustainable development of its economy and protect its 
environment. 160 COM (2002)278 final, ibid. – See also Communication from the Commission 'European Governance: Better Lawmaking',

GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 100 'Regulatory Reform' means changes that improve regulatory quality, that is, enhance the 
performance, cost-effectiveness, or legal quality of regulation and formalities. 'Secondary regulation' means regulation which can be made by a person (a Minister) or a body 
(an independent local authority). 'SIGMA' (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management in Central and Eastern 
European Countries) means the joint OECD/EU initiative launched in 1992, coordinated and 
principally financed by the European Commission which aims, amongst other objectives, at 
assisting the new EU Member states and candidate countries in modernising and strengthening 
their policy-making capacities. 'Soft law' means administrative circulars and administrative discretion. 'Sunsetting' means the automatic repeal of regulations a certain number of years after they 
have come into force. This will usually trigger a review of the regulation just before repeal occurs. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 101 ANNEX 2: BASELINE Baseline The Baseline establishes a set of norms in relation to seven key areas (A to G) and will be used 
to assess: @BULLET 
Horizontally (i.e., whole of Government) an overarching policy and capacity of a country 
to create and implement an explicit regulatory policy, and 
@BULLET 
Vertically (i.e., with particular regulatory area) the application of a better regulation policy 
to particular policy activities. A. 
A policy as regards regulatory management. B. 
A regulatory agenda-setting process. C. 
A process for the formulation of policy and its translation in to regulations (whether legal 
or administrative instruments). D. 
A regulatory quality assurance process. E. 
An enactment process. F. 
An enforcement/compliance mechanism. G. 
A review process in respect of particular regulations or generally after an agreed period 
of operation. A. 
A specific regulatory management policy 1. The regulation of a country needs to be managed by reference to a specific policy on 
regulatory management: that is, a policy which has as its object the improvement of regulatory 
quality and is driven politically and by appropriately staffed structures. The policy should focus on 
new legislation as well as the stock of existing regulations, to bring about constant improvement 
in regulation making and the overall regulatory environment. The policy should stand as a clearly 
identifiable policy in the way fiscal or environmental policy can be seen and understood as 
explicit policies. 2. The capacity to undertake such a policy needs to be demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
A written policy on regulatory management that operates across Government and 
secures a whole of Government approach to policy areas that overlaps. 
@BULLET 
The existence of a body or structure to carry out the policy. 
@BULLET 
An appropriate number of suitably qualified personnel. 
@BULLET 
Reports or other indicators of the strengths and weaknesses of the policy. 
@BULLET 
Appropriate tools and mechanisms for ensuring enforcement of policy. B. 
An agenda setting process GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 102 1. Effective regulatory management requires planning in the form of a general strategy to achieve 
the political, economic, environmental and social goals of government as well as tactical planning 
to deal with the day – to – day implementation of government programmes and the effective 
negotiation, enactment and implementation of EU policies. The planning process should show 
evidence of a capacity to set goals and a capacity to ensure that goals, once set, are achievable 
and achieved. 2. The capacity of the agenda setting process needs to be demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
Descriptions of the process. 
@BULLET 
Published plans such as government or coalition programmes. 
@BULLET 
Administrative structures. 
@BULLET 
An appropriate number of suitably qualified personnel. 
@BULLET 
Reports or other indicators that agreed outcomes in specified periods were achieved. 
@BULLET 
A capacity to ensure compliance with agendas once set. C. 
Policy formulation and regulation drafting process 1. Inherent in regulatory management is the process of formulating policy and articulating it in the 
form of regulations. Regulatory quality is a function of the people and processes involved in the 
analysis of problems, the design of regulatory solutions, the composition of regulations, the 
quality assurance of regulation, the implementation of, or compliance with, regulations and the 
review of regulations once put in place. Good regulatory management is a function of the policies 
(explicit policies on regulatory management and policies as regards each sector), tools 
(consultation, regulatory impact assessment, use of alternatives to traditional command and 
control regulation) and institutions involved in the process. 2. The capacity of the policy formulation and regulation drafting process needs to be 
demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
A transparent process articulated by law or set out in check lists, for analysis of 
problems and decision making or similar guidelines. 
@BULLET 
Appropriate structures for the analysis of policy issues and their resolution by regulatory 
or other means. 
@BULLET 
Appropriate tools such as regulatory impact analysis tools. 
@BULLET 
An appropriate number of suitably trained personnel as regards particular areas of policy 
formulation and regulation drafting. 
@BULLET 
As regards EU measures, processes and personnel for the analysis of proposals and 
the enactment and implementation of EU policy. 
@BULLET 
Appropriately designed and managed consultation processes, regulatory impact 
assessment tools and a variety of regulatory implementation tools including alternatives 
to traditional command and control regulatory tools. D. 
Quality assurance process 1. Good regulatory management requires a built in quality assurance process that validates 
regulations against good regulation principles such as: @BULLET 
Constitutionality and conformity with general principles of law including EU law and 
policy. 
@BULLET 
Consistency within the regulation. 
@BULLET 
Consistency with other regulations, government and EU policy generally. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 103 @BULLET 
Proportionality. 
@BULLET 
Clarity. 
@BULLET 
Accessibility. 
@BULLET 
Effectiveness not only as regards the achievement of stated policy objectives but also 
from the point of view of minimising  " red tape "  and burdens particularly burdens on small 
to medium enterprises (SME's). 
@BULLET 
Conformity with budgetary policy. 
@BULLET 
Economic, environmental and social impact (including impact on small to medium 
enterprises). 
@BULLET 
Efficiency and effectiveness (as regards practicability and implementation). 
@BULLET 
Transparency and non discrimination. 
@BULLET 
Adequacy of resources to achieve particular objectives. 
@BULLET 
Powers to enforce quality standards. 
@BULLET 
Administrative burdens and reduction of red tape. 2. The quality assurance process needs to function horizontally as regards the implementation of 
an overarching policy on regulatory management and vertically within each body responsible for 
making regulations. 3. The capacity of the policy formulation and regulation drafting process needs to be 
demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
An institution or set of equivalent arrangements for quality assurance, horizontally 
across the whole of Government and vertically in respect of each regulation making 
body. 
@BULLET 
Published or ascertainable norms of regulatory quality. 
@BULLET 
Procedures for quality review. 
@BULLET 
A sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel. 
@BULLET 
Reports on the quality assurance process (internal) prepared by the bodies themselves 
or by parliamentary committees or academic commentators. 
@BULLET 
Practices and procedures to deal with failures to achieve high quality regulation in 
accordance with agreed norms. E. 
Enactment 1. To achieve effective regulatory management there should be enacted a specific law as 
regards regulatory quality management which prescribes regulatory norms. 2. Enactment is central to the regulatory management process whether it be by a parliament 
(primary legislation) or a delegated body (delegated legislation). The enactment process typically 
involves some kind of review of policy issues and quality review of the regulations. It is 
unnecessary to review the existence of such institutions and would be inappropriate to give a 
qualitative analysis of them. However, a useful indicator of the potential capacity of enactment 
institutions may be determined from a review of the existence and extent of research, secretarial 
and library facilities available to legislators. 3. The capacity of the enactment process needs to be demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
An institution or set of equivalent arrangements for quality assurance. 
@BULLET 
Published or ascertainable norms of regulatory quality. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 104 @BULLET 
Procedures for quality review. 
@BULLET 
A sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel. 
@BULLET 
Reports on the quality assurance process (internal) prepared by the bodies themselves 
or by parliamentary committees or academic commentators. F. 
Compliance and enforcement of regulations 1. The formulation and making of regulations is the initial part of the regulatory process. In order 
to be effective regulations need to be complied with or compliance with them must be enforced. It 
would require an extensive study to assess the total capacity to ensure compliance or 
enforcement of regulations. Consequentially, two areas are selected as indicators: intellectual 
property regulations and environment protection regulations. 2. The capacity of the enactment process needs to be demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
The accessibility of the relevant regulatory regimes and the extent to which explanatory 
materials are available to make the regulatory requirements known. 
@BULLET 
Reports (internal or external) indicating the extent to which the regulatory regimes are 
effective measured against subjective government self assessments of effectiveness or 
objective assessments undertaken by academic commentators, consumer, commercial 
and environmental interest groups. 
@BULLET 
The availability of a sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel to undertake 
inspections, ascertain levels of compliance and secure enforcement. G. 
Review 1. An essential characteristic of regulatory management is the extent to which regulations, once 
put in place, are reviewed from the point of view of effectiveness and relevance. 2. The capacity of the regulatory review process needs to be demonstrated by reference to: @BULLET 
The existence of review processes (general and particular) for review evidenced by 
institutional arrangements and reports or the proceedings of those institutions. 
@BULLET 
The availability of a sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel to undertake 
inspections, ascertain levels of compliance and secure enforcement. 
@BULLET 
Evidence of co-operation with international bodies whether by participating in peer 
reviews or otherwise. GOV/SIGMA(2007)6 105 ANNEX 3: QUESTIONNAIRE FOR PROJECT TO ASSESS THE REGULATORY
