status and the principle of adequate or equal access to health care based on need. These policy objectives 
require an evidence-based approach to measure progress. This paper assesses the availability and 
comparability of selected indicators of inequality in health status and in health care access and use across 
OECD countries, focussing on disparities among socioeconomic groups. These indicators are illustrated 
using national or cross-national data sources to stratify populations by income, education or occupation 
level. In each case, people in lower socioeconomic groups tend to have a higher rate of disease, disability 
and death, use less preventive and specialist health services than expected on the basis of their need, and 
for certain goods and services may be required to pay a proportionately higher share of their income to do 
so. Options for future OECD work in measuring health inequalities are provided through suggesting a small 
set of indicators for development and inclusion in the OECD Health Data database. Some indicators 
appear to be more advanced for international data collection, since comparable data are already being 
collected in a routine fashion in most OECD countries. These include the indicators of inequalities in self-
rated health, self-rated disability, the extent of public health care coverage and private health insurance 
coverage, and self-reported unmet medical and dental care needs. Increased availability and comparability of data will improve the validity of cross-national comparisons of 
socioeconomic inequalities in health status and health care access and use. Harmonisation of definitions 
and collection instruments, and the greater use of data linkages in order to allow disaggregation by 
socioeconomic status, will determine whether health inequalities can be routinely monitored across OECD 
countries. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 4 RÉSUMÉ Les politiques de santé dans la plupart des pays de l'OCDE ont comme objectifs majeurs la réduction des 
inégalités en matière de santé et le respect du principe d'un accès adéquat ou égal aux soins basé sur les 
besoins. Des données robustes et fiables sont nécessaires pour mesurer l'atteinte de ces objectifs politiques. 
Ce document de travail évalue la disponibilité et la comparabilité de certains indicateurs de l'inégalité de 
l'état de santé et de l'accès et de l'utilisation des soins dans les pays de l'OCDE, en se concentrant sur les 
disparités selon les groupes socio-économiques. Ces indicateurs sont illustrés à partir de sources de 
données nationales ou internationales qui permettent de distinguer les populations par niveau de revenu, 
d'éducation et d'emploi. Dans tous les cas, les personnes appartenant à des groupes socio-économiques 
désavantagés ont tendance à avoir des taux de morbidité, d'incapacité et de mortalité plus élevés, à utiliser 
moins de services préventifs et de soins spécialisés que ce à quoi on pourrait s'attendre sur la base de leurs 
besoins, et à payer une plus large part de leur revenu pour se procurer certains biens et services de santé. Parmi les options de travaux futurs de l'OCDE figure le développement d'un petit ensemble d'indicateurs 
clés dans le domaine des inégalités en santé qui pourraient être intégrés dans la base de données Eco-Santé 
OCDE. Certains indicateurs semblent plus avancés que d'autres pour une collecte de données 
internationales, puisque des données comparables sont déjà collectées régulièrement dans la plupart des 
pays de l'OCDE. Ces indicateurs comprennent les indicateurs d'inégalité dans l'état de santé général 
perçu, l'incapacité auto-déclarée, le degré de couverture des soins de santé publics et de l'assurance 
maladie privée, et les besoins de soins médicaux et dentaires non satisfaits. Accroître la disponibilité et la comparabilité des données améliorerait la validité des comparaisons 
internationales des inégalités socio-économiques de l'état de santé et de l'accès et de l'utilisation des soins. 
Pour que l'évolution de ces inégalités soit mesurée de manière régulière dans les pays de l'OCDE, il faudra 
harmoniser les définitions et les méthodes de collecte de données entre pays, et développer les possibilités 
de lier différentes sources de données au niveau national afin de permettre une désagrégation selon le statut 
socio-économique.

There have been substantial improvements in average levels of health outcomes in developed 
countries over the past 50 years as demonstrated by the health status indicators in OECD Health Data, and 
as summarised in Health at a Glance 2007. Life expectancy at birth has increased on average in OECD 
countries from 68.5 years in 1960 to 78.6 years in 2005, infant mortality has declined from 29 deaths per 
1 000 live births in 1970 to 5 in 2005, and ischaemic heart disease mortality rates have fallen from 178 per 
100 000 population in 1980 to 96 in 2004. Premature mortality – years of life lost before age 70 – has been 
cut by more than half on average since 1970 (OECD, 2007a). 2. 
Differences in health continue to exist among populations, despite the gains of the past half 
century. These health differences are apparent along many dimensions including age, gender, race or ethnic 
group, geographic area and socioeconomic status. These differences, also known as variations or 
differentials in health, are here referred to as health inequalities or disparities. Health inequalities which 
are avoidable and are considered to be  " unfair "  according to some social norm which may vary across 
countries, are here termed health inequities (Kawachi et al., 2002). 3. 
Health inequality is a global issue, involving rich and poor countries alike. The importance of 
health inequalities and their determinants, along with the unfairness and avoidability of health inequities, 
has recently been underlined by the release of the Final Report of the World Health Organization's 
Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH, 2008). Central to the Commission's work was 
examining how health is distributed across the social spectrum and how the social conditions in which 
people grow, live, work and age determine health. The Commission has emphasised that social 
determinants of health produce widespread inequalities in health within and between societies. These 
inequalities can be measured and described, and the evidence from this process can be used in producing 
policies and programmes for change. 4. 
The growing research interest in health inequalities has required an evidence base to be 
developed, so that these inequalities can be better understood. Recent work on developing this evidence 
base has followed two broad strands. The first examines social and economic determinants of health and 
health inequalities among different groups in society, often defined by income, education, occupation or 
some other measure of socioeconomic status. The second strand deals with low or differential use of health 
services among different economic or other groups (Gwatkin, 2007). These two strands are explored in this 
paper. 5. 
The objective of this paper is twofold. First, to review the availability and comparability of 
leading indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in health care access and use in OECD 
countries, illustrated by examples using existing data. Second, to outline the steps required to improve the 
availability and comparability of these leading indicators, in order to promote regular monitoring of 
progress toward policy goals of reducing health inequalities and providing adequate or equal access to 
care. 1 1 No indicators of socioeconomic disparities in health care quality are proposed in this paper, since the 
development of a reliable and comparable set of health care quality indicators is still at an early stage under the DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 8 6. 
Table 1 summarises leading indicators that can be used to measure socioeconomic inequalities in 
health within the two domains of health status and health care access and use, and indicates in broad terms 
the data developmental work needed to improve the availability and comparability of data across OECD 
countries. The paper expands on this summary by giving examples of how these indicators have been used 
in research. Data availability and constraints are discussed in further detail, and conclusions are drawn on 
the steps required in order to be able to collect such data in a comparable manner across OECD countries. OECD's Health Care Quality Indicators (HCQI) project. Regarding inequalities in non-medical determinants 
of health, the OECD Economics of Prevention project has begun to collect data on a number of determinants 
of health (overweight and obesity, physical activity and nutrition) by level of education and other aspects of 
socio-economic status, which may lead to an eventual extension of the regular OECD data collection for those 
determinants that will be assessed as being most available and comparable across countries (OECD, 2009). 
Regarding inequalities in health care financing, one relevant indicator is included in this paper – out-of-pocket 
expenditure by income group. Determining progressivity in other types of financing mechanisms (general 
taxation, social security contributions, and private health insurance) falls outside the scope of this paper. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 9 Table 1: Data requirements to measure leading indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health (a) Indicator

sourced from health surveys or censuses, and it requires standard classifications and survey questions to enable meaningful cross-
country comparisons. (b) Feasible / Less feasible – the feasibility of international data collection. This is based on whether, in most OECD countries, data

whether linkage between different data collections is required. Routine / Periodic – how frequent international data collection might be; whether the indicator is best suited for routine data collection 
(annual or biennial), or for periodic collection (every 3-5 years). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 11 A FOCUS ON SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH 7. 
Health inequalities exist along many demographic or social dimensions, including sex, age, racial 
and ethnic group, geographic area and socioeconomic status. The usual starting point in measuring health 
inequalities is to examine variations by sex and age, and OECD Health Data already reports these for 
several health status measures. It indicates, for instance, that while a substantial gap in life expectancy 
remains between men and women, the gap has narrowed in most OECD countries over the past twenty-five 
years (OECD, 2007a). Mortality data also indicate that the distribution of ages at death among both men 
and women varies widely across OECD countries (OECD, 2007b). As a next step, the focus is to review 
the availability and comparability of measures of health disparities by socioeconomic status, including 
their interactions with sex and age. 8. 
In almost all countries and in different health systems, a socioeconomic gradient in health status 
exists. As socioeconomic disadvantage increases, the circumstances in which people live and work are 
more detrimental, there is an increase in the behaviours which worsen risks and so worsen health 
outcomes, and an accompanying increase in morbidity and mortality. Populations may be divided into 
groups characterised by social stratification, with individuals occupying higher or lower levels on a 
hierarchy – their position on this hierarchy being their socioeconomic status (SES). Persons of lower SES 
– typically those with a lower income, a lower level of education, or in a less prestigious occupational 
group – tend to have a higher prevalence of illness and disease, can expect to live less years in good health, 
have higher mortality rates and die at younger ages. The health burden attributable to socioeconomic 
disadvantage is large. 9. 
Socioeconomic inequalities are evident not only in population health status, but also in the access 
to, and use of health care services. Poorer or less educated persons, despite having higher rates of illness, 
disease and death, often have difficulties in locating appropriate specialist and preventive health services, 
they use these services less, and for certain goods and services they may be required to pay a 
proportionately higher share of their income to do so. 10. 
Socioeconomic inequalities in health have been observed among different SES groups both 
within and between countries, regardless of affluence or political or social systems. These inequalities have 
not diminished in recent decades and in some cases have widened. This finding implies that inequalities are 
deeply entrenched within the social structures of modern societies, and it provides a warning that 
reductions in health disparities might be difficult to achieve in the short term (Mackenbach, 2006; 
Mackenbach et al., 2007). 11. 
Most national administrations have developed public policies and strategies to reduce 
socioeconomic inequalities in health status (e.g. Acheson et al., 1998; Department of Health, 2003; AHRQ, 
2008; Judge et al., 2006; Mackenbach & EUROTHINE, 2007). Attempts to quantify the economic impact 
of health inequalities have pointed to substantial gains that might be made through their reduction (Walker, 
2005; Mackenbach et al., 2007). Many OECD countries have also endorsed as a major policy objective the 
principle that access and use of health care should be based on need, and not the ability to pay (OECD, 
2004a). Each of these policy objectives requires an evidence-based approach to measure progress. 12. 
Identifying and measuring the burden of ill-health in socially disadvantaged sections of the 
population provides great potential for improving the average health status of the whole population. Cross-DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 12 country comparisons of socioeconomic inequalities in health status, and in the access and use of health 
services can suggest areas for improvement for health administrations, and can provide possible policy 
directions that aim at their reduction. The information gained from the measurement of inequalities gives 
an impetus and focus for policy makers, as well as a yardstick by which to assess interventions and gauge 
progress. 13. 
For these reasons, the focus in this paper is on examining inequalities in health by socioeconomic 
status. The universal prevalence of socioeconomic inequalities in health, and the importance of education, 
income and occupation as determinants of health, makes a strong case for selection. This does not negate 
the importance of other dimensions that are used to examine inequalities in health, such as geographic area 
or race and ethnicity. In a number of OECD countries, racial and ethnic disparities in health remain a great 
challenge (Kawachi et al., 2005; Mead et al., 2008). Health differences by geographic area, especially with 
respect to access to care in remote areas, are also an important policy concern in many countries. A recent 
OECD publication has reviewed a number of measures adopted in OECD countries to increase the supply 
of doctors in remote and underserved areas (OECD, 2008). Selection of leading indicators of health inequalities 14. 
Table 1 presented a set of leading indicators that might be used to measure different 
socioeconomic inequalities in health status, and in health care access and use. The selection of these 
indicators has been based mainly on the criteria of relevancy, interpretability and feasibility (assessed in 
terms of data availability and comparability). 15. 
Indicators for measuring inequalities in health status have been grouped into three categories: 
(i) indicators related to life expectancy and mortality, (ii) indicators related to morbidity and disability, and 
(iii) composite indicators which include both mortality and morbidity information. 16. 
Indicators for measuring inequalities in health care access and use here include: (i) health 
insurance coverage, (ii) health care utilisation in relation to different services, (iii) measures of unmet care 
needs, and (iv) out-of-pocket expenditure as a share of household income. A further indicator of 'effective 
coverage of interventions', which was suggested recently as part of the refinement of the WHO framework 
for health system performance assessment and which has been tested at the state level in Mexico, is 
discussed in Annex 1. Classifying social groups 17. 
Socioeconomic status, the hierarchy used here to classify or stratify social groups, can be ordered 
in numerous ways. The most common of these are by using educational level, occupational group and 
income level or wealth. Indices comprised of more than one measure of SES may also be used. 2 A number 
of international classifications of these stratifiers of SES can be used to facilitate cross-national 
comparison. @BULLET Educational level is typically measured by a hierarchical classification of the population by 
completed education. Under the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) at 
least four categories are identified, corresponding to elementary, lower secondary, upper 2 Area-based indices, for example, are constructed from weighted variables collected through a census or other 
survey, and allow for comparisons of social and economic conditions across a country. Persons living in areas 
with lower scores are then associated with a lower average SES. The variables used differ across countries, so 
the indices cannot be used for cross-country comparison. Examples include the Socioeconomic Indexes for 
Areas (SEIFA), used in Australia, and the Socioeconomic Risk Index (SERI), used in Canada. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 13 secondary and tertiary. Part-time and vocational training are also included, but are difficult to fit 
into the hierarchy. @BULLET Occupation information is used to divide the population into a number of groups, with 
distinctions often made between farmers, unskilled and skilled manual groups, self-employed, 
and lower and upper non-manual groups. The International Standard Classification of 
Occupations (ISCO) can be used to identify more specific categories of occupation. A person's 
occupational group may vary throughout their working life, but it is usually determined by the 
individual's current or last occupation. @BULLET Income level can be classified according to individual income, or by the household equivalent 
income – household income adjusted for size and composition, i.e. numbers of adults and 
children. The entire population may then be classified into a number of groups of equal frequency 
for analysis (e.g. five-groups: quintiles, or ten-groups: deciles). Income level may also be 
analysed by using national poverty lines in order to determine SES. Measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health 18. 
There are many measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health, and they vary in complexity. 
These measures differ in at least two ways: (i) whether they measure relative or absolute differences in 
health, and (ii) whether the measurement technique is simple or sophisticated (Mackenbach & Kunst, 
1997). The choice of which is most appropriate depends largely on the objectives of the particular study 
being undertaken. 19. 
Relative or absolute differences – Measurement can be expressed as a relative difference (for 
example, a rate ratio) or an absolute difference (for example, a difference in rates). Both are important, as 
the theoretical example in Figure 1 illustrates. Assume two population groups A and B that have seen large 
falls in mortality rates between two reference years 1970 and 2000, with the gap between the two also 
narrowing. In 1970, the gap was 30 deaths per 100 000 population, coming down to only 10 in 2000. The 
ratio of deaths per 100 000 population between groups A and B has increased from two in 1970 (60/30) to 
three in 2000 (15/5). The mortality rate of both groups has improved and the absolute gap between them 
has narrowed, however Group A's relative position has not improved; and in 2000 it was worse. The 
illustration highlights that to gain a better understanding of the health status of the two groups, both 
measurements should be considered. Absolute measures are important for decision-makers, especially 
when goals in absolute terms have been set, because they allow a better appraisal of the magnitude of a 
public health problem (Schneider et al., 2004). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 14 Figure 1: Relative and absolute differences in socioeconomic health inequalities 0 15 30 45 60 75 1970 
2000 Year Group A Group B Deaths per 100,000 population 20. 
Simple or sophisticated measures – Simple measures of inequality such as the rate difference and 
the rate ratio between lower and higher socioeconomic groups allow for ease of calculation and 
interpretation. These measures of the 'gap' between two population groups generally only considers health 
inequalities between the two extreme groups, such as the highest and lowest income groups equivalent to 
quintiles 1 and 5 if a population is divided into five equal groups. Gap measures emphasise the situation of 
the most deprived group. The measures are often used for routine data collection and for monitoring over 
longer time periods. However, they ignore information on the large proportion of the population that falls 
in between, in quintiles 2, 3 and 4. 21. 
A second group of more sophisticated regression-based measures summarise the magnitude of 
inequalities across all population groups. These include summary indices such as the relative index of 
inequality, and the concentration index, which is calculated in a similar fashion to the Lorenz curve and 
Gini coefficient (Wagstaff et al., 1991; Mackenbach & Kunst, 1997; Schneider et al., 2004; Harper & 
Lynch, 2005). These measures include information on both the magnitude of inequality and the total 
population distribution of inequality, but at the expense of ease of interpretation and with greater 
restrictions on the types of data which can be used. They often require that socioeconomic status be 
measured on a quantifiable scale, and this might prove problematic for education-and occupation-based 
indicators. 22. 
An important consideration in choosing an appropriate measure of health inequality is the ease in 
which they allow for routine data updating and ongoing monitoring. The choice of health inequality 
measure is guided by restrictions imposed by available national or cross-national data, the requirements for 
regular data provision and the assembling of a time series, the ease of interpretability and the resources 
available for calculation of the indicator. Simpler measures such as rate ratios and rate differences would 
be more feasible for a regular data collection such as the one carried out under OECD Health Data. In 
using these simple measures, due care should be taken to present as much contextual information as 
possible, such as providing both relative and absolute differences. Data sources and challenges to improve comparability 23. 
Data sources used to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in health should be nationally 
representative, and must contain individual-level information which can be combined to form groups of DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 15 similar socioeconomic status. Data should contain measures of age, sex, SES and health status or health 
care access and use. To ensure robust cross-national comparisons, each of these measures must be 
collected in a standard fashion across all countries. Some common data sources that are used include vital 
statistics collections such as mortality registries, censuses, population-based surveys and health or social 
security records (see Table 1). 24. 
National mortality registries provide information on deaths by sex, age and cause, but in most 
countries registries collect little or no information that can be used to determine socioeconomic status. This 
means that data linkages need to be made between mortality registries and other comprehensive 
information sources on the population (such as censuses), so as to be able to classify indicators of mortality 
or life expectancy by some measure of socioeconomic status. In practice this only occurs in some 
countries, and it is generally not undertaken for routine monitoring purposes. 25. 
National health sector information such as hospital admission records rarely include information 
on income, education, occupation or other socioeconomic measures. If place of residence is collected, this 
can be used to assign individuals to an area-based SES measure. Information derived from these sources 
usually needs to be linked to another source which provides information on SES. 26. 
Health surveys are particularly well-suited to national-level analyses of inequalities in health 
status (especially morbidity/disability) and in health care access and use. However, gathering comparable 
data at an international level is limited by variations in the questions used to measure either health status, 
or health care access and use, or socioeconomic status (see Annex 2). Limitations are also imposed by 
differences in survey methodologies such as the reference population used and the mode of survey 
administration. Further efforts to harmonise survey questions on health status, health care access and use, 
and socioeconomic variables are required in order to improve the comparability of the data used to 
measure socioeconomic inequalities in health. 27. 
In Europe, cross-national health interview surveys (or health modules in broader surveys) provide 
information on self-assessed health and disability, as well as on health care use and unmet care needs based 
on a common set of questions. These surveys include: @BULLET European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) – covers the entire adult 
population aged 16 years and over in countries surveyed, except the population in institutions. 
The survey contains questions that can be used to examine inequalities in four areas: self-rated 
general health, chronic illnesses or conditions, activity limitation (disability) and unmet need for 
medical or dental examination or treatment. Information is also collected on education and 
income, allowing population stratification by SES. The survey is conducted annually. Data are 
currently available for 15 European countries for the year 2004, and 27 countries for 2005 and 
2006. Data tables are available at the Eurostat website (www.epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu). 3 3 EU-SILC is the successor to the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), which was a panel survey 
conducted annually in most EU countries from 1994 to 2001. ECHP included a small number of health-related 
questions covering self-rated health, chronic illness and activity limitation, the use of health and dental 
services, and health risk factors, along with information on education and income level. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 16 @BULLET European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) – Eurostat has developed a number of modules to 
measure a wide variety of indicators of health status, health care use and socioeconomic status in 
a harmonised way. European Union countries are being encouraged to periodically (once every 
five years) implement these modules in their national surveys. About two-thirds of the 27 EU 
countries have committed to implement the survey between 2006 and 2010. The EHIS holds 
potential for future analysis of health inequalities by socioeconomic status. 4 @BULLET Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) – covers populations aged 50 and 
over, excluding the population in institutions, and contains questions on physical health, 
behavioural risks, cognitive function, mental health and health care, as well as on income, 
education and occupation. Eleven countries contributed to the 2004 baseline study, with 15 
participating in a second wave of data collection in 2006–07, and 16 due to participate in the third 
wave in 2008–09. This survey is similar in many ways to the US Health and Retirement Survey 
(HRS). Information is available at www.share-project.org. 28. 
Beyond Europe, one of the main cross-national surveys that has been used to collect information 
on socioeconomic inequalities in health is the Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey. 
This survey is conducted annually by the Commonwealth Fund, and it has been used to carry out similar 
analyses among the non-European and European OECD countries covered – seven in 2007, including 
Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States 
(Schoen et al., 2007). The survey contains questions on unmet health care needs and access problems, and 
results from the 2001 and 2004 surveys were published with an analysis by respondent income 
(www.commonwealthfund.org). The 2002–03 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health is another 
survey that has been used to measure and compare socioeconomic disparities in health status, health care 
use and unmet care needs between these two countries (Sanmartin et al., 2004). 4 The Eurostat website also contains data from national health interview surveys that were carried out between 
1999 and 2003 in most EU Member States and which were harmonised to the extents possible. The data 
include survey results regarding questions on self-rated health, longstanding illness and disability (activity 
restriction), health service use and preventative screening, stratified by educational level 
(www.epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 17 1. INDICATORS OF INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH STATUS 29. 
Kunst and Mackenbach (1995) have defined socioeconomic inequalities in health status as  " Differences in the prevalence or incidence of health problems between individual people 
of higher or lower socioeconomic status "  30. 
In using this definition it should be emphasised that although individuals are referred to, analyses 
of socioeconomic inequalities in health usually consider groups of individuals, linked by a common SES. 
Within such a group, the individuals comprising it will differ in their health status; however taken as a 
whole, people with lower SES tend to have higher morbidity and mortality rates. 1.1 Mortality-based indicators 31. 
Indicators such as life expectancy, cause-specific and total mortality rates and infant mortality are 
commonly used to monitor population health status. Data by sex and age are widely available and 
relatively precise, but data linked to other measures of SES are scarcer. Life expectancy 32. 
Life expectancy is a measure of how long a person might expect to live if the mortality patterns 
occurring in a particular year remained unchanged over a lifetime. Life expectancy measures the length of 
life, but not its quality. The measures are derived from life tables, which are commonly calculated using 
mortality data held in registries, although surveys and censuses may also be used. To calculate life 
expectancies for different socioeconomic groups, mortality data for individuals must be 'linked' to another 
data set which includes information on the individuals' SES, such as a census. 33. 
In 2006, Eurostat established a Task Force to develop indicators of life expectancy by socio-
economic status for EU countries. The Task Force's preferred approach is to link death certificates with 
census information. The next census in 2011 provides an opportunity to put in place or refine the statistical 
systems needed for the production of harmonised mortality data by socio-economic status. However, the 
requirement for data linkage with census information means that this indicator might not be suited for 
regular monitoring, since censuses are infrequent. But because life expectancies tend to increase slowly in 
developed countries, except in certain circumstances, monitoring may only be necessary at 5-yearly 
intervals or longer. 34. 
The available evidence shows that life expectancy is shorter among persons from lower 
socioeconomic groups, reflecting group differences in the risk of dying. A number of studies have 
observed differences in life expectancy at birth between lowest and highest socio-economic groups, in the 
order of four to six years among men and two to four years among women, but larger differences may also 
be observed (Mackenbach, 2006; Singh & Siahpush, 2006; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2008; 
Whitehouse & Zaidi, 2008). 35. 
Figure 2 provides an illustration of the link between socioeconomic inequality and life 
expectancy. Men and women working in the least skilled occupations in England and Wales can expect to 
live seven years less than persons working in professional occupations. The effect is observed not only 
between the least and most skilled; the social gradient is evident across all levels of society, so that in this 
example skilled workers have two to three years lower life expectancy than those in professional 
occupations. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 18 Figure 2: Occupational group differences in life expectancy, England and Wales, 2002–2005 70

Figure 3 provides a further example, using income groups. Longitudinal data from household 
panel surveys conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States indicate that average 
total life expectancy for a 40-year-old low-income male (the lowest third of equivalised net household 
incomes) is four to five years less than that of high income male (the highest third) (Whitehouse & Zaidi, 
2008). Figure 3: Income differences in male life expectancy at age 40 in Germany, the UK and the US 37.7 38.8 38.4 36.6 37.4 35.8 33.6 33.3 34.7 20

Analyses stratifying populations by education give the same picture (Figure 4). The life 
expectancy of better-educated men and women in the Russian Federation increased substantially between 
1980 and 2001, while it declined for the least-educated. In 1980, life expectancy at age 20 for university-
educated men was three years greater than for men with elementary education only; by 2001 this difference 
had increased to 11 years. Similar patterns were seen in women (Murphy et al., 2006). A widening in life 
expectancy inequalities between those with lower and higher socioeconomic status scores has also been 
observed in Finland around this time, with differences in deaths from cardiovascular diseases and alcohol-
related conditions together accounting for most of the increase in health inequalities in that country 
(Mackenbach, 2006). 38. 
The monitoring of socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy is part of a Programme for 
Action for the national health inequalities strategy in England (Department of Health, 2008). A target for 
life expectancy has been set: by 2010 to reduce the gap between the fifth of areas with the worst health and 
deprivation indicators and the population as a whole, by at least 10%. Figure 4: Trends in male and female life expectancy at age 20, by educational attainment, Russian Federation,

Important differences in mortality rates are found between different socioeconomic groups. Rates 
of mortality are higher among persons with lower levels of education or income, or in lower occupational 
classes, and these differential rates are evident for most major causes of death. These inequalities in 
mortality exist across all age groups and both sexes, although they tend to be smaller among women than 
men (Mackenbach, 2006). 40. 
Vital statistics registries are the starting point for examining socioeconomic inequalities in 
mortality. Information on income, education or occupation is needed to stratify populations by SES, and 
this is usually obtained through linking mortality records to a census or other survey. In some countries, 
relevant information such as the usual occupation of the deceased is collected following death, and is 
included on death certificates. This information can be used to stratify populations by SES, if available 
electronically. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 20 41. 
Measuring SES using levels of income, education or occupation is not straightforward, and due 
care needs to be taken in ensuring that cross-national comparisons are valid through comparing similar 
categories. The requirement for data linkage to censuses or other surveys adds difficulty to using this 
indicator for routine monitoring purposes, since censuses are infrequent. 42. 
Data on total mortality rate ratios by education, income and occupation are available for most 
OECD countries, albeit on an irregular basis (see, for example, Mackenbach et al., 2008; Fukuda et al., 
2007; Khang et al., 2004). Long time series of mortality data with socioeconomic information covering 
large national samples are only available for a limited number of countries. 43. 
Figure 5 presents information on deaths among mostly middle-aged men and women in a number 
of European countries. Mortality data were linked to censuses carried out during the early-to-mid 1990s in 
order to obtain information on the highest level of completed education. Age-standardised death rates and 
rate ratios were calculated for educational groups, with a rate ratio of 1.0 indicating no difference between 
lower and higher educated persons. Mortality rates among less educated persons are markedly higher. In 
European countries, less educated persons have a 20–50% excess risk of dying than more educated 
persons, and in some countries mortality rates are more than double. Inequalities are larger for men, except 
in Spain (Mackenbach, 2006). Figure 5: Ratio of total mortality rates between less and more educated people, selected EU countries, 1990s

A further example from Korea shows inequalities in mortality among men, according to their 
highest level of completed education (Figure 6). Men with the least education had mortality rates four to 
five times higher the most educated group. Although mortality rates fell for all groups over the ten-year 
period 1990–1991 to 2000–2001, the relative level of socioeconomic inequality in mortality appeared to be 
unchanged (Khang et al., 2004). Figure 6: Mortality rate ratios by highest level of education, Korean men aged 30–59, 1990–1991 to 2000–2001 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1990-1991

Infant mortality is a frequently-used indicator of population health and social progress. All 
OECD countries have seen remarkable progress in reducing infant mortality in recent decades, with an 
average reduction of 80% across the 30 countries between 1970 and 2005 (OECD, 2007a). Yet widespread 
inequalities in infant mortality rates persist within countries. Figure 7 provides an illustration, and shows 
infant mortality rates for urban neighbourhoods in Canada by quintiles of wealth. Rates declined rapidly 
for all neighbourhoods between 1971 and 1996, although they remain highest among the poorest 
neighbourhoods. Inequalities narrowed somewhat over the time period, in that the rate ratio of the richest 
and poorest neighbourhoods (Q1/Q5) declined from 2.0 in 1971 to 1.7 in 1996, although progress slowed 
after 1991. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 22 Figure 7: Infant mortality rates by quintiles of wealth, Canada, 1971–1996 0 4 8 12 16 20 1971

A similar study examined trends in infant mortality in the United States between 1960 and 2002, 
by county median family income (Krieger et al., 2008). Infant mortality declined in all county income 
quintiles, and both absolute and relative inequalities shrank between 1966 and 1980; relative health 
inequalities widened thereafter, with little change in the magnitude of absolute differences. 47. 
A number of countries use infant mortality to monitor health inequality targets. The United 
Kingdom Department of Health target is to reduce the gap in infant mortality in England and Wales 
between the 'routine and manual' occupation group and the population as a whole to 10% by 2010 
(Department of Health, 2007). The infant mortality rate among the routine and manual group was 17% 
higher than the total population in 2004–06, compared with 19% higher in 2002–04, and 13% higher in the 
baseline year 1997–99. While the gap has decreased in recent years, further progress will be needed to 
reach the 10% target by 2010. 48. 
The same data sources used for the analysis of total or cause-specific mortality allow for the 
examination of socioeconomic inequalities among particular age groups, including infants. The need for 
age-standardisation of data is avoided, but the challenge of linking data sources containing information on 
mortality and SES remains. Determining the SES of an infant is usually through ascertaining the status of a 
parent, or of the geographic area of residence of the household. 1.2 Morbidity-based indicators 49. 
Other measures beyond those based on mortality are required for monitoring inequalities in 
population health status. As life expectancy increases and chronic disease prevalence continues to rise, 
policy makers need additional information on the non-fatal consequences of disease and severity of health 
conditions. A number of morbidity-based indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health are available, 
generally utilising information on self-reported health, illness or activity limitation. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 23 Self-reported health 50. 
Questions on self-reported health form part of most national and cross-national health surveys, 
and can be used to gauge levels and distributions in population health status. These surveys include a 
question of the form:  " How is your health status in general? Very good, good, fair, bad or very bad " . 
Although subjective in nature, within particular national cultures the measure correlates well with other 
measures of health status, and it has been found to be useful in predicting future health problems and health 
service use (Miilunpalo et al., 1997). This question, or more elaborate sets of questions on self-reported 
health, can also be used in the calculation of healthy life expectancies and other summary measures of 
health (see next section). It remains one of the most widely available indicators of health inequalities by 
SES. 51. 
The main sources of information on self-reported health are national, or cross-national health 
interview surveys. In European countries, both EU-SILC and EHIS collect information on self-reported 
health, and the available data allow a stratification of the population either by income or education. In 
order to promote valid international comparisons, the methods and instruments – including the survey 
questions, response categories and the populations surveyed – must be standard (see Annex 2). For the 
purpose of measuring disparities in each country, populations within countries must also share common 
cultural standards and perceptions of good health. For these reasons, caution is required when making 
cross-country comparisons using this indicator. A number of cross-national studies of self-reported health 
by SES are available (Sanmartin et al., 2004; NOMESCO, 2004; Mackenbach, 2006). 52. 
When self-reported health is analysed by SES groupings, important differentials in population 
health status are revealed. Among Nordic countries, for example, a series of national surveys conducted in 
2000–2002 found that greater proportions of persons with low education report poorer health, and more so 
in Finland than Sweden, Norway or Denmark (Figure 8). Women tended to report poorer health than men, 
except in Finland. Figure 8: Percentage of people reporting poor health, by education and gender, Nordic countries, 2000–2002 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 DNK SWE FIN NOR

These findings are repeated in many countries – people in lower socioeconomic groups report 
poorer health. But the extent of inequality varies from country to country, with differing rates of inequality 
between income groups reporting 'very bad' or 'bad' health, for example (Figure 9). Within EU countries, 
reported poor health among the population as a whole is most prevalent in Eastern European countries 
(Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Poland), along with Portugal and Spain; however, as 
previously discussed, different populations do not always share common standards and perceptions of good 
health. Inequalities within countries between low and high income groups are greater in Belgium, Iceland, 
Ireland and the United Kingdom, although in the latter three countries, the proportion of persons reporting 
poorer health is low. Figure 9: Inequalities in persons reporting their health as 'very bad', by income quintile and rate ratio, selected

The situation is no different in non-European countries, with numerous studies confirming poorer 
self-rated health among persons from lower socioeconomic groups. There are differences, however, in the 
specific measure of SES used in the published data that are readily available, with some countries such as 
Australia and New Zealand using a Disadvantage or Deprivation Index, while other countries use 
education or income levels (Table 2). Such differences hamper cross-country comparisons with data 
derived from EU-SILC. 55. 
Inequalities in self-reported morbidity are substantial, and persons with lower socio-economic 
status have higher morbidity rates not only in self-reported health, but also in chronic conditions and 
disability. The inequalities are persistent, although as yet it is unclear whether gaps are widening over time 
(Mackenbach, 2006). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 25 Table 2: Inequalities in fair/poor health in 6 countries, by socioeconomic position Country

Monitoring disability is important in the light of population ageing and increasing rates of 
chronic disease. Self-reported disability reflects the non-fatal consequences of disease and impairment, and 
can provide some indication of the need for medical and social services. Information on self-reported 
disability may also be used to calculate various measures of healthy life expectancy (see next section). 57. 
Progress towards a universal concept and definition of disability was assisted by the adoption of 
the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by the World Health 
Organization in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The ICF uses the term 'disability' to broadly cover any or all of the 
following components: impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction, as influenced by 
environmental factors 5 . A number of cross-national initiatives (notably the Budapest Initiative on Health 
Status Measures, and the UN Washington City Group on Disability Statistics) have in recent years sought 
to develop a small set of standard questions on health status and disability that could be recommended for 
use in (cross-) national surveys or censuses. 58. 
Currently, measures of self-reported disability are available for most OECD countries, although 
the survey instruments vary across countries, thereby limiting comparability (see Annex 2). In Europe, the 
EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) includes one general question on 
disability. The health status module in the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) also recommends that 
EU countries use this question, along with a more elaborate set of questions, to measure different types of 
disabilities. Other countries include questions on disability in general health or specialised surveys, 5 Impairments are  " problems in body function or structure such as significant deviation or loss " . Activity 
limitations are  " difficulties an individual may have in executing activities " . Participation restrictions are 
 " problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations " . Environmental factors  " make up 
the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives "  (WHO, 2001). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 26 although the question might measure a different type of disability. Additional demographic and other 
information collected in these surveys allow for stratification of respondents by SES groups. 59. 
Disability rates tend to be higher among socioeconomically disadvantaged persons. Results from 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2003 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, for example, 
indicate that self-reported disability is three to four times more prevalent in the lowest income quintile, 
compared with the highest income quintile (Table 3). This finding is related to people in lower 
socioeconomic groups having higher frequencies of physical and mental health problems. Table 3: Self-reported disability status

A large body of evidence reports that higher educational levels are associated with lower levels 
of disability (Mackenbach, 2006; Lafortune et al., 2007). Higher educational levels are often accompanied 
by higher incomes and standards of living, a lower risk of work-related injury or ill-health, and healthier 
behaviours such as a balanced diet and a lower prevalence of smoking and risk alcohol drinking. Across 19 
OECD countries in the late 1990s, the average disability prevalence rate among groups with lower 
educational attainment was 19%, compared with 11% among the better educated (OECD, 2003). 6 1.3 Summary measures of population health 61. 
Increasingly, a variety of health information is needed to complement conventional measures of 
life expectancy, and to determine whether ageing populations are living longer lives free of disability or ill 
health. Summary measures of population health assist in this by combining information on both mortality 
and morbidity, so as to better monitor population health and forecast future health care needs. These 
measures provide information on the number of remaining years a person might expect to live, and on their 
health status during those years. 62. 
Several measures have been developed, each seeking to calculate the average expectation of 
years of life in equivalent good health, after adjusting for years lived with some form of illness or 
disability. Summary measures of population health include Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE), 6 Based on national surveys, including the European Community Household Panel in European countries. In this 
survey, respondents who answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you have any chronic physical or mental health 
problem, illness or disability?' were then asked 'Are you hampered in your daily activities by this physical or 
mental health problem, illness or disability', and responded either 'Yes, severely/Yes, to some extent/No'. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 27 Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). These measures 
may also be calculated for different socioeconomic groups within a population. 63. 
The measures are relatively easy to interpret, being based on recognisable concepts of illness, 
disability and mortality. Their calculation is more complex, since they rely on at least two data sources – a 
measure of morbidity or disability, usually a health or household interview survey, and a measure of 
mortality, often a census cohort linked to a mortality registry. One of these sources must also contain 
information on socioeconomic status, if summary measures by SES group are to be calculated. 64. 
Regular monitoring of summary measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health within 
countries is still uncommon. Cross-national comparisons of summary measures are further complicated by 
needing to ensure that the concepts and methods used in data sources are standard across countries. In 
recent years, international organisations such as Eurostat and the World Health Organization have made 
efforts to improve understandings and applications of concepts and methods, and to harmonise summary 
measures of population health, although it remains a challenge to disaggregate them by SES. Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) 65. 
The Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) measure aims to quantify the remaining years a 
person of a certain age can expect to live without disability. The measure requires mortality data as for a 
standard life table, and estimates of the prevalence of disability among population age groups, usually as 
self-reported in health surveys. The valuation of self-reported disability status is based on a simple 
dichotomous value of 0 (if people report being moderately or severely disabled, depending on the cut-off 
point) or 1 (if they report not being disabled). To calculate DFLE by SES, one of the data sources must 
also contain information on income, education or occupation. 66. 
DFLE has been adopted as a European Structural Indicator, and it is calculated and reported by 
Eurostat on a regular basis, using the EU-SILC as the source for the disability measure 7 . Work continues to 
develop the measure, with DG-SANCO and Eurostat establishing an EU Task Force on Health 
Expectancies in 2006. The strategic plan of the Task Force includes improving current Healthy Life Year 
(i.e. DFLE) estimates, improving international comparability, and calculating Healthy Life Years for SES 
groups (EU Task Force on Health Expectancies, 2007). This latter goal depends crucially, however, on 
achieving progress in calculating life expectancy by SES in a consistent way in EU countries. 67. 
A number of non-European countries have also calculated DFLE, using self-reported disability 
questions from their own national health or disability surveys. The US National Centre for Health Statistics 
currently uses three measures of Years of Healthy Life, including DFLE, to monitor the US 'Healthy 
People 2010' public health programme. Questions and response categories often differ across countries and 
surveys, and these will require standardisation if they are to be used for cross-national comparison. For 
instance, the question on disability used by the US National Center for Health Statistics (taken from the 
National Health Interview Survey) includes only two response categories (Yes, limited in activities or No, 
not limited), while the disability question in EU SILC includes three responses (Yes, severely limited; Yes, 
limited but not severely; No, not limited). There are also differences in the wording of the question. These 
differences can be expected to affect the comparability of overall prevalence rates of disability in the 
population, however, they probably have less impact if the focus is on examining the distribution of 
disability by SES within each country. 7 In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council invited the European Commission to present an annual report on 
progress achieved in the areas of employment, innovation, economic reform, social cohesion and the 
environment. 'Structural Indicators' allows quantitative evaluation and comparison of performances of the 
Member States in these areas. The DFLE Structural Indicator is also known as 'Healthy Life Years'. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 28 68. 
The example in Figure 10 shows life expectancy for females with and without disability in 
England, as derived from the annual Health Survey for England. SES was measured by calculating material 
deprivation deciles, based on area of residence information from the 1991 Census. Females born during 
1996–1999 could expect to live 60 years free of disability on average, but with wide variation, from 55 
years in most deprived areas to 65 years in least deprived areas. Figure 10: LE and DFLE at birth by deprivation deciles, females, England, 1996–1999 65

Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) measures the number of years that an individual can 
expect to live in full health if current morbidity and mortality conditions prevail. It 'adjusts' life 
expectancy by weighing years of life lived in good health higher than years lived in poor health. The 
weighing of years of life depends on the valuation of different health conditions, with values ranging from 
0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents full health. 70. 
Information required to calculate HALE includes a life table in order to calculate life 
expectancies, a population health survey which describes the health status of the population, and a 
valuation of the different health conditions. HALE may be calculated for socioeconomic groups if both life 
expectancy and health status measures can be linked to the same SES measure. Valid cross-country 
comparisons are also subject to the same constraint. 71. 
HALE has been calculated for the 2001 Canadian population (Figure 11), using the Health Utility 
Index to describe and value health status. In this example, life expectancy at birth and at age 65 are 
presented for both males and females in different income groups. Both sexes in lower income groups can 
expect to live less years in full health. At birth, Canadian males in the lowest income group had a HALE 
almost five years lower than that for males in the highest income group; among females, HALE was three 
years lower (Health Canada, 2006). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 29 Figure 11: Health Adjusted Life Expectancy by sex and income level, at birth and age 65, Canada, 2001 14.7 13.3 72.3 70.5 14.3 12.9 70.8 68.6 14.2 12.0 69.1 65.8 0

A third summary health measure, the Disability Adjusted Life Year, or DALY, is also used to 
examine socioeconomic inequalities in health. The DALY is a 'health gap' measure that extends the 
concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) to include equivalent years of 'healthy' 
life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability (YLD). DALYs thus represent the sum of 
YLL and YLD, with one DALY representing the loss of one year of equivalent full health (Murray et al., 
2002). 73. 
The calculation of DALYs requires a number of data sources. The YLL component is derived 
from information on numbers of deaths, and life expectancies at various ages, as sourced from life tables 
and mortality registers. The YLD component requires data on disease incidence and duration until 
remission or death, as well as a weight factor reflecting disease severity on a scale from 0 (perfect health) 
to 1 (death). It can be derived from various sources, including disease registers, hospital administrative 
data or health interview surveys. 74. 
DALYs have been used as summary measures of population health by the World Health 
Organization in their Global Burden of Disease Study and World Health Reports (Lopez et al., 2006), 
although data were not disaggregated by SES groups. Several countries have produced their own Burden of 
Disease reports, using DALYs to monitor health inequalities (e.g. Begg et al., 2007 for Australia). 75. 
DALYs have been calculated for the Australian population by SES, using 2003 mortality and 
morbidity/disability data. Not surprisingly, populations in areas with lower SES experienced proportionally 
higher burdens of disease in terms of disability and mortality than populations in areas with higher SES 
(Figure 12). The difference exceeded 30% between the most and least disadvantaged populations (Begg et 
al., 2007). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 30 Figure 12: DALY rates by socioeconomic quintile, age-standardised, Australia, 2003 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 Low

Ensuring adequate access to essential health services on the basis of individual need is a health 
policy goal in all OECD countries. Most countries further endorse the principle of 'equal access to equal 
care for equal need'. Almost all OECD countries have introduced universal health insurance coverage to 
ensure financial access to a core set of health services (OECD, 2007a). Despite this, inequalities in health 
care access and use remain for different reasons, and these may act to either mitigate or exacerbate 
inequalities in health status. 77. 
Health care access means people's ability to obtain appropriate health care services in a timely 
fashion and without obstacle. Some common barriers to access include financial reasons, a lack of health 
care providers, excessive travelling distance to providers, and excessive waiting time to see providers. 
Health care use relates to people's actual utilisation of different types of services (Academy Health, 2004). 
In determining inequities in health service utilisation, an adjustment to actual utilisation rates is often 
needed in order to compensate for people's differing needs for care, using available information such as 
their self assessed health status. 78. 
Measurement of inequalities in access and use may simply be in terms of comparing rates of 
unmet care or rates of service utilisation between low and high income groups. It may also be measured 
using more complex indices that seek to account for differences across the whole population, and not just 
between highest and lowest socioeconomic groups. 79. 
Indicators that are commonly used to gauge equity in health care access and use include the 
extent of public and private health insurance coverage across SES groups, the receipt or use of different 
types of health services (ideally adjusted for need, where applicable), the reporting of unmet care needs for 
various reasons, and the proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure in relation to household income or 
consumption. A discussion of each of these follows. 2.1 Health insurance coverage 80. 
One potential barrier to receiving appropriate health care is inadequate insurance coverage. 
Health insurance coverage provides financial security against the costs of unexpected illness and assists 
access to innovative treatments and preventative services. Most OECD countries have achieved universal 
coverage of health care costs for at least a core set of services, sometimes through combinations of public 
and private health insurance. Three countries that have not yet attained universal coverage are Mexico, 
Turkey and the United States (OECD, 2007a) (Figure 13). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 32 Figure 13: Health insurance coverage for a core set of services, 2006 (or latest year available) 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.8 99.9 89.5 99.7 99.3 99.0 98.7 98.5 98.3 96.3 27.4 67.2 50.4 10.3 57.5 0

Data from the US National Health Interview Survey indicate that about 30% of persons aged less 
than 65 years who are deemed poor or near-poor do not have health insurance (Figure 14), compared to 
10–15% of middle income and 5% of high income persons. The uninsured are more likely to have poorer 
health status and die early. They report more problems in getting care, are diagnosed at later disease stages 
and receive less therapeutic care. The uninsured are sicker when hospitalised and are more likely to die 
during their hospital stay. In the United States, the problem of persistent uninsurance is seen as a major 
barrier to receiving health care, and, more broadly, to reducing health inequalities (AHRQ, 2008). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 33 Figure 14: Persons aged less than 65 years with health insurance, by income, United States, 1999-2005 50 60 70 80 90 100 1999

Total population insurance coverage is imperfect in indicating health care accessibility, since the 
package of health goods and services included and the cost-sharing arrangements may vary from country to 
country, as well as within countries (OECD, 2007a). It is important to look at basic health insurance 
coverage in conjunction with other types of private health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket spending 
for health services (see next section on this latter topic). 83. 
Private health insurance plays a number of roles in OECD health systems, either as a primary or 
supplementary source of insurance coverage. Complementary or duplicate coverage is also possible 
(OECD, 2004c). In a number of countries, private health insurance coverage varies by SES. In Australia, 
23% of persons in the lowest income quintile in 2004–05 had private health insurance, compared with 76% 
of those in the highest income quintile (ABS, 2006). In France, coverage of complementary health 
insurance is unequal across income groups, and poorer households spend proportionally more of their 
incomes to purchase it (10.3% of income in the lowest income quintile vs. 2.9% in the highest) (Kambia-
Chopin et al., 2008). Private health insurance need not necessarily create access inequities, however, 
especially if voluntary schemes complement what are otherwise fairly equitable distributions of care 
(OECD, 2004b). 84. 
OECD Health Data already collects data on public and private health insurance coverage, 
although not disaggregated by income group. In countries that do not have universal health insurance 
coverage, data on public and/or private health insurance coverage by SES may be collected through health 
interview or household surveys. 2.2 Out-of-pocket expenditure 85. 
Measuring the financial burden of out-of-pocket spending on households is important, since these 
burdens can create barriers to health care access and/or use. Households having difficulties paying medical 
bills may delay or forgo needed health care (Hoffman et al., 2005; May & Cunningham, 2004, cited in 
Banthin et al., 2008). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 34 86. 
In contrast to publicly-funded care, out-of-pocket payments are distributed based on the use of 
care, and not on the ability to pay. If the financing of health care becomes more dependent on out-of-
pocket payments, its burden is, in theory, shifted towards those who use the services more (possibly from 
rich to poor, if health care needs are higher for the low income groups). In practice, many countries have 
put in place exemptions and caps to out-of-pocket payments for lower income groups to protect health care 
access. 87. 
The burden of out-of-pocket health spending on households can be measured either by its share 
of total household income or its share of total household consumption. Data presently collected under 
OECD Health Data show that the average share of out-of-pocket spending in household consumption 
varies considerably across OECD countries in 2006, representing less than 2% of total household 
consumption in countries such as the Netherlands and France, while such spending accounted for more 
than 6% of total household consumption in Switzerland and Greece. The United States, with almost 3% of 
consumption being spent on out-of-pocket health services, is close to the average. 88. 
The distribution of spending across the population can vary considerably, depending on whether 
such spending is affected by income, service use, type of coverage, or other factors. For instance, an 
analysis of data from the US Medical Expenditure Survey found that 28% of Americans living in a poor 
family (defined as a family income below the federal poverty level) were spending more than 10% of their 
after-tax family income for health services and health insurance premiums in 2004, compared with 10% of 
Americans living in a high income family (Banthin et al., 2008). 8 89. 
A 2007 Commonwealth Fund survey found that – in addition to almost 50 million people who 
were uninsured in the US – an estimated 25 million people aged 19–64 (or 14% of all adults) were 
underinsured, a 60% increase since 2003. Persons were defined as 'underinsured' if they experienced at 
least one of the three indicators of financial expenditure exposure relative to income: (1) out-of-pocket 
medical expenses for care amounted to 10% of income or more, (ii) among low-income adults (below 
200% of the federal poverty level), medical expenses amounted to at least 5% of income, or 
(iii) deductibles equalled or exceeded 5% of income. Underinsurance varied by SES group, from 7% of 
adults earning USD 100 000 or more, to 26% of adults earning less than USD 20 000 per annum. In total, 
42% of US adults were found to be underinsured or uninsured, reporting high levels of access problems 
and financial stress (Schoen et al., 2008). 90. 
A small proportion of households in OECD countries face  " catastrophic "  health expenditure each 
year, often defined as payments for health services exceeding 40% of their disposable income after 
subsistence needs are met. In Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United States, rates of catastrophic 
spending exceed 0.5% (Xu et al., 2007). The incidence of financial catastrophe in the lowest income 
quintile would be expected to exceed that in higher quintiles; however the imposition of user fees may 
mean that households in lower income quintiles do not use enough services to incur catastrophic 
expenditures. 91. 
Information on the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in total household income or consumption 
disaggregated by income group is collected through regular household expenditure surveys in a number of 8 Another analysis of data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey found that Americans under the age of 35 
spent an average of 2.7% of their income on health care, as compared with 12.9% among those 65 and over, 
despite the fact that insurance coverage through Medicare is universal for the latter group, while about 15% of 
those 35 and under lack health insurance coverage. Those with incomes under USD 20 000 spent 15.2% of 
their income on health care, compared with 2.6% of those with incomes of USD 70 000 and above. This 
analysis is presented in a Medicare chart book available on the website of the US Centres for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (www.cms.gov). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 35 OECD countries. Some further developmental work would be needed to obtain comparable data on this 
type of measure across countries. 2.3 Health care utilisation 92. 
Socioeconomic status is an important factor in determining how populations utilise health care 
services. Income, education and occupational status affect health care need, recognition and response to 
health symptoms, knowledge of disease, and access and choice of health services. Although people in 
lower socioeconomic groups tend to have higher rates of disease and mortality, they do not necessarily 
utilise health care at greater rates. 93. 
After adjusting for differences in the need for health care, the use of primary health care is 
generally found to be equitable or fairly distributed, but research has found a 'pro-rich' bias in the use of 
specialist and dental care, as well as in the use of preventative services such as breast and cervical cancer 
screening (Van Doorslaer & Masseria in OECD, 2004b; Mielck et al. in Mackenbach & EUROTHINE, 
2007; WHO, 2008; Gakidou, 2008). 94. 
Van Doorslaer & Masseria (OECD, 2004b) used a sophisticated measure, the concentration 
index, to measure income-related inequality in the use of various types of medical care in OECD countries. 
The study aimed at comparing the actual distribution of medical and dental care by income, adjusted by 
need. Survey data were sourced from the European Community Household Panel conducted in 2000 by 
Eurostat, as well as from national health surveys in non-EU countries. Results for specialist visits are 
shown in Figure 15. Even after health service need was accounted for, higher income persons in all 
surveyed countries – except the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway – were more intensive users 
of specialist visits than lower income groups. This was especially so for Portugal, Finland, Ireland and 
Italy, four countries where private insurance and direct private payments play a role in accessing specialist 
services. More recent research has also found that, after controlling for need, people with higher education 
levels in nine European countries tend to use specialist care more than less-educated people (Or et al., 2008). Figure 15: Horizontal inequity indices for specialist care use in 17 countries, 2000 or nearest available year -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 UK NLD BEL DEU CAN GRC HUN FRA NOR ESP SUI AUT DNK ITA IRL FIN PRT Note: Specialist care is inequitable (in this case, favouring high income groups) if the 95% confidence limit is significantly different

Table 4 presents data from the Dutch National Survey of General Practice, carried out in 2001. 
After correcting for demographics and for self-rated health, less educated persons visited GPs more often 
than persons with higher education levels, but their utilisation rates were significantly lower for a number 
of services, including dental visits, psychosocial care and Pap smear use (cervical cancer screening). 
Further exploration of these data found lower utilisation of care among certain immigrant populations and 
asylum seekers, among persons in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and among marginalised groups such as 
illegal residents (Westert & Verkleij, 2006). 96. 
Health interview surveys are a major source of data on both health care use and socioeconomic 
status. By also using available information on age, sex and health status, it is possible to adjust health care 
use by some measure of need where applicable, as illustrated by the results from the Dutch survey. 
However, the reliability of survey estimates depend on the methodology used and an adequate sample size, 
while the comparability of data across countries depends on the harmonisation of questions and other 
aspects of survey methodologies. There is also some doubt as to whether the reception of evidence-based 
necessary care can be accurately assessed through self-report questionnaires. Table 4: Care utilisation by level of education, persons aged over 25, The Netherlands, 2001 Level of education (per cent)

In reviewing different methods used to measure inequalities in health care utilisation, Wagstaff et 
al. (1991) noted that there were two – the slope index of inequality and the concentration index – that were 
able to present a complete picture of socioeconomic inequalities in health. These two indices use all DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 37 available data, and do not focus simply on those persons in the highest and lowest SES groups. Of the two, 
the concentration index provides a means of quantifying the degree of socioeconomic-related inequality in 
a specific health variable (O'Donnell et al., 2008). The concentration index measure has been criticised by 
some researchers on the grounds that it is difficult to calculate and interpret, and it is open to 
misunderstanding (Mackenbach & Kunst, 1997). One option for policy makers and researchers is to use the 
concentration index as an adjunct to more simple and straightforward measures of health inequality. 2.4 Unmet care needs 98. 
An additional measure of health care access is whether people report an unmet care need for 
some reason, whether a doctor visit, a dental consultation, a hospital admission or another type of care. In 
order to determine unmet care, individuals are typically asked health interview questions of the nature: 
 " Was there a time in the previous 12 months that you felt you needed health care services but did not 
receive them? " , followed by a question to determine why the need for care was unmet. Such questions are 
a feature of a number of national and cross-national health interview surveys, including EU-SILC, the 
recommended health care module in EHIS, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 
(SHARE), the international health policy surveys conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, and the Joint 
Canada/United States Survey of Health. 99. 
Research indicates that unmet care needs are experienced mostly by people with low SES, 
whether through low income, lack of insurance coverage, or because they come from a racial or ethnic 
minority group. Common reasons given for care needs not being met include excessive costs of care, 
excessive waiting times to receive care, or having to travel too far to receive care (Sanmartin et al., 2004; 
Mielck et al., in Mackenbach & EUROTHINE, 2007). 100. 
The International Health Policy surveys regularly conducted by the Commonwealth Fund report 
on unmet care among a number of non-European countries, as well as in Germany, the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom (Figure 16). The 2007 survey found that foregone care for a number of different 
treatments due to costs remains more prevalent among lower income groups, although the level is much 
lower in the United Kingdom than in the United States. In the United States, adults with below-average 
incomes who have health insurance report significantly fewer access problems due to cost than their 
uninsured counterparts (Blendon et al., 2002). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 38 Figure 16: Persons reporting an unmet care need

The EU-SILC collects data on unmet medical and dental care needs in a majority of OECD 
countries. In Europe, higher rates of unmet need for medical examinations among the adult population 
were reported in Poland (9.3%), Greece (5.8%) and Portugal (5.0%) in 2006 (Figure 17). But inequalities 
within countries were greater in countries such as Belgium, Portugal and the Slovak Republic, although in 
Belgium the overall reported level of unmet care is low (less than 1%). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 39 Figure 17: Persons reporting an unmet need for a medical examination because of problems of access, by

In 2006, participating European countries also reported differing rates of unmet need for dental 
care among the total adult population (Table 5), but all countries reported higher rates among lower SES 
groups. Large disparities exist between quintile 1 (lowest income) and quintile 5 (highest income) in 
Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden. Note, however, that in Belgium and Luxembourg, 
the proportion of the population reporting unmet dental care need in each quintile is relatively small. 103. 
Information both on unmet care need and socioeconomic status can be derived from the same 
collection instrument, and data are available for a large number of countries, albeit the specific questions 
and answers vary across surveys/countries (see Annex 2). Since a number of these surveys are ongoing, 
annual data has the potential to provide a picture of trends in socioeconomic inequalities in unmet care 
needs. Various cross-national studies have used this indicator to examine access to care among 
socioeconomic groups (Schoen et al., 2007; Sanmartin et al., 2004; Mackenbach & EUROTHINE, 2007; 
Huber et al., 2008). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 40 Table 5: Proportion of adults reporting unmet needs for dental examination, by income quintile, selected EU

This paper has surveyed indicators that might be used to measure socioeconomic inequalities in 
health status, and in health care access and use. 105. 
Based on the criteria of policy relevancy, interpretability and data availability across countries, a 
number of potential indicators are suggested, along with an indication of how frequently these indicators 
might be collected. To allow broad comparisons across OECD countries, improvements in data availability 
and comparability would need to be made for many of the suggested indicators. Regarding mortality-based 
measures, the main challenge for countries is to link data from mortality registers to a measure of 
socioeconomic status (SES). For the purpose of international comparison, the same measure of SES (be it 
income, education or occupation) would need to be used in all countries. Regarding morbidity-based 
measures, the main challenge is to further harmonise a key set of questions in national health survey 
modules on health status and health care use, and to be able to link this information with a standard 
measure of SES. This is currently being done in Europe through the development of the European Health 
Interview Survey. Comparisons might also be broadened by expanding the country coverage in multi-
country surveys, such as those conducted by the Commonwealth Fund. 106. 
Survey-based measures of health status and of health care access and use might be subject to a 
number of potential limitations, such as cultural biases, recall biases, different coverage of the population 
(e.g., inclusion or exclusion of the population in institutions), and issues related to the representativeness of 
the survey sample. Nonetheless, health-related surveys remain a unique source of data in most countries to 
measure socioeconomic inequalities in health status and health care access and use. While cultural factors 
might affect responses to survey questions that are more subjective in terms of the average level across 
countries, they are likely to have a lesser impact if the focus of the analysis is on disparities across 
socioeconomic groups within each country (assuming that the different socioeconomic groups in each 
country share common cultural characteristics). 107. 
The indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in health and health care access judged at this stage 
to be feasible for regular (i.e. annual or biennial) collection include: self-rated health, self-rated disability, 
and measures of unmet care needs. Indicators that are judged feasible to collect for a reasonable number of 
countries, but which are more suited to periodic collection (i.e. every three to five years) include: life 
expectancy, total mortality rate, infant mortality rate, the proportion of the population who do not have any 
health care coverage (for the few countries where this may be relevant), measures of health care use 
(adjusted where appropriate for need), and the share of out-of-pocket expenditure. Collection of the 
different indicators of healthy life expectancy (disability-free life expectancy, health adjusted life 
expectancy, and disability adjusted life years) is less feasible, given the current state of data development. 108. 
The examples discussed in this paper help underline some of the issues involved in making valid 
multi-country comparisons of health inequality, not the least of which are harmonisation of definitions and 
measurement instruments, and the need for data linkages in order to allow disaggregation by SES. The 
effort made to improve data availability and comparability will determine whether health inequalities can 
be regularly monitored across most or all OECD Countries. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 42 GLOSSARY OF TERMS Health care access – An individual's ability to obtain appropriate health care services. (Academy 
Health, 2004) Health care financing – The different methods of paying for health care. Health care use (or utilisation) – Commonly examined in terms of patterns or rates of use of a single 
service or type of service (e.g. hospital care, physician visits, prescription drugs). Use is also expressed in 
rates per unit of population at risk for a given period. (Academy Health, 2004) Health disparities (or differences) – See health inequalities Health inequalities – Variations in health status, health care access and use, and other health 
indicators, between individuals and groups. With respect to health status, health inequalities have been 
defined as differences in the prevalence or incidence of health problems between individuals or groups. 
(Kunst & Mackenbach, 1995) Health inequities – Health inequalities that are deemed to be unfair, or which stem from some form 
of social injustice (Kawachi et al., 2002). Equity in health care access means that people's needs should 
guide the distribution of opportunities for well-being. Health status – An individual's or populations' overall level of health, taking account of various 
aspects such as life expectancy, amount of disability, levels of disease risk factors and so forth. 
Conceptually, health status is the proper outcome measure for the effectiveness of a specific population's 
medical care system, although attempts to relate effects of available medical care to variations in health 
status have proved difficult. (Academy Health, 2004) Progressivity – The extent to which the burden of health finance increases as individual or household 
income increases. Socioeconomic status (SES) – An individual's or family's relative position in society, usually 
expressed in terms of income, education or occupation. Summary measures of population health – Measures that combine information on mortality and 
non-fatal health outcomes to represent population health in a single number (WHO, 2003). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 43 ANNEX 1: A SUMMARY OF THE  " EFFECTIVE COVERAGE "  MEASURE 109. 
The notion of  " effective coverage "  was introduced several years ago as a way of refining the 
WHO framework for health system performance assessment (WHO, 2003). It has been defined as  " the 
proportion of potential health gain that can be delivered through an intervention by the health system that is 
actually delivered "  (Lozano et al., 2006). If, for example, a health system could increase life expectancy 
for women by two years through early detection and treatment for cervical cancer, but delivers only one 
year, then effective coverage for this health problem is 50%. Effective coverage attempts to bring together 
measures of the use of interventions, conditional on need, with the quality of the intervention delivered. 110. 
One of the first countries which tried to implement a measure of effective coverage was Mexico, 
and some initial results are presented in Figure 18. Using data collection systems including health 
examination surveys, vital registrations and hospital discharge information, 14 different health 
interventions were monitored in 2005–06. 9 Effective coverage for these 14 interventions taken together 
was found to vary across different areas of Mexico, from 54% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65% in the more 
affluent Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions varied by 
household wealth, from 52% for the lowest wealth quintile to 61% for the highest quintile. Inequalities 
existed between income quintiles for the combination of all 14 interventions measured, for maternal and 
child health coverage (8 interventions) and for other adult interventions (6 interventions). The absolute gap 
in effective maternal and child health coverage was 9% between lowest and higher income quintiles, and 
14% for other adult interventions (Lozano et al., 2006). 111. 
The selection of interventions to monitor is dependent on available data, and several sources may 
be needed. These include biomedical data (e.g. to test for HIV infection, blood pressure, blood sugar or 
cholesterol). A number of important questions need to be answered in order to determine effective 
coverage, namely, who needs an intervention, who receives the intervention and what was the quality of 
the intervention? Answering each of these requires measurement. To enable cross-country comparison, a 
core set of coverage indicators and a standard survey module are needed, with measurement of the 
distribution of coverage carried out across all socioeconomic groups. Effective coverage may have broad 
applicability in both developing and developed countries, although substantial data developmental work 
would be needed to implement this approach at the national and international level. 9 The interventions are: measles immunisation, DTP3 immunisation, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, 
services delivered to premature babies, treatment of acute respiratory infections in children, treatment of 
diarrhoea in children, breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, treatment of vision disorders, 
treatment of hypertension, treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, influenza vaccine. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2009)2 44 Figure 18: Effective coverage for health interventions, by household wealth quintile, Mexico, 2005-06 0 20 40 60 80 100 1
