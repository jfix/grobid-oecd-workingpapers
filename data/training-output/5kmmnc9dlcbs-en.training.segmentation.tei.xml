			<body>Summary <lb/>Many governments in different parts of the world are investing in high speed rail. Some of <lb/>them do so thinking that it will be an important part of climate change mitigation. Intercity <lb/>traffic over medium distances is particularly interesting in the environmental context as it <lb/>constitutes the only transport segment where aircraft, trains, coaches and cars naturally <lb/>compete for market shares. <lb/>This report calculates the effect on emissions from building a new high speed link that <lb/>connects two major cities located 500 km apart. It assumes that emissions from new vehicles <lb/>and aircraft in 2025 can be used as a proxy for the emissions during a 50 year investment <lb/>depreciation period. The emissions from the marginal production of electricity, used by rail <lb/>and electric vehicles, are estimated to amount on average to 530 gram per kWh for the entire <lb/>period. Fuels used by road vehicles are assumed to be on average 80 percent fossil and 20 per <lb/>cent renewable (with a 65% carbon efficiency in the latter case). <lb/>Traffic on the new line after a few years is assumed to consist to 20 per cent of journeys <lb/>diverted from aviation, 20 per cent diverted from cars, 5 per cent from long-distance coaches, <lb/>and 30 per cent from pre-existing trains. The remaining 25 per cent is new generated traffic. <lb/>Under these assumptions would the investment result in a net reduction of CO 2 -emissions of <lb/>about 9,000 tons per one million one-way trips. Assuming 10 million single journeys per year, <lb/>the total reduction would be 90,000 tons. <lb/>When the price of CO 2 is $40 per ton, the socio-economic benefit of the reduction would <lb/>amount to $3.6 million, which is very little in the context of high speed rail. The sensitivity <lb/>analysis shows that alternative assumptions do not significantly change the outcome. One <lb/>may also have to consider the impact on climate change from building the new line. <lb/>Construction emissions for a line of this length may amount to several million tons of CO 2 . <lb/>There is no cause to prohibit investment in high speed rail on environmental grounds so long <lb/>as the carbon gains made in traffic balances the emissions caused during construction. <lb/>However, marketing high speed rail as a part of the solution to climate change is clearly <lb/>wrong. Investment in infrastructure for modal shift should only be considered when traffic <lb/>volumes are high enough to carry the cost. The principal benefits of high speed rail are time <lb/>savings, additional capacity and generated traffic, not a reduction of greenhouse gases. <lb/></body>

			<body>Background <lb/>Intercity passenger transport is growing fast to meet demand for mobility from private citizens <lb/>and the business community. A shift to fast modes of transport makes it possible to travel <lb/>longer annual distances within restrained time budgets. Aviation and high speed trains are the <lb/>fastest among modes. Although high speed comes at the price of negative environmental <lb/>impact, many environmentalists claim, along with the companies and interest organizations of <lb/>the rail sector, that high speed trains are environmentally benign and should be allowed to <lb/>form an important part of climate change mitigation. <lb/>de Rus and Nash (2007 take another view; &quot; Decisions to invest in high speed rail have not <lb/>always been based on sound economic analysis. A mix of arguments, besides time savings – <lb/>strategic considerations, environmental effects, regional development and so forth – have <lb/>often been used with inadequate evidence to support them. &quot; <lb/>Intercity traffic over distances between 400 and 600 km is particularly interesting in the <lb/>environmental context as it constitutes the only transport segment where aircraft, trains, <lb/>coaches and cars naturally compete for market shares. Among the parameters that influence <lb/>modal choice are price, travel time, frequency, comfort and personal safety. Environmental <lb/>considerations may also play a role although rather few appear to be willing to make any <lb/>larger sacrifice in terms of cost in order to contribute to a better environment. <lb/>The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the difference in environmental impact <lb/>between passenger transport modes is large enough to justify government investment in <lb/>modal shift. As investment in new infrastructure usually has to be written-off over 40 to <lb/>60 years, the perspective in this paper is long-term. Limiting the analyses to current <lb/>differences in environmental impact between cars, buses, trains and aircraft would clearly be <lb/>wrong. <lb/>A distinction is made in this paper between fast passenger trains and high speed trains. The <lb/>former travel at a maximum speed of 150-200 km/h, while the latter are capable of top speeds <lb/>in the excess of 250 km/h. Average speeds, however, may be lower due to track restraints. <lb/>Intermodal competition <lb/>The author assumes that few people find it acceptable to travel between cities located 400 to <lb/>600 kilometers from each other at average speeds below 90-100 km/h when infrastructure that <lb/>allows such speeds or more exists. Therefore the potential environmental benefits from <lb/>travelling at average speeds below 100 km/h are disregarded in this paper. <lb/>The willingness-to-pay for high speed varies among people and is closely connected to <lb/>income (or having someone else pay ones bill). The fact that some customers prefer <lb/></body>

			<body>low-speed intercity trains to fast trains or high-speed trains is a sign of this. This means that <lb/>investment in rail for high-speed trains will have only an insignificant effect, if any, on those <lb/>customers who currently prefer local trains (with many stops) to existing fast trains. <lb/>Presumably the effect on those who today prefer to travel by car will also be small, although <lb/>perhaps not insignificant. The reasons for taking the time to travel by car may be reduced cost <lb/>(e.g. several people travelling in one car) or that the traveler needs a car on his arrival to the <lb/>destination. <lb/>Table 1 shows the time that it takes to travel from city center to city center by different <lb/>modes. It is assumed that the air passenger on average has to devote a total of 70 minutes on <lb/>ground level connections to and from airports and needs to check in 30 minutes earlier than a <lb/>train passenger. Passenger who check-in luggage may need an additional 10 minutes. <lb/>Aircrafts are assumed to spend 10 minutes on waiting and taxing. People travelling by car are <lb/>assumed to need a 30 minutes break for a fast meal when the distance is 600 km. <lb/>From the table it is evident that conventional trains can compete with air traffic up to a <lb/>distance of a little less 400 km. However, at 500 and 600 km it takes a high speed train to beat <lb/>aviation. The fact that some people nevertheless choose to travel by aviation may be <lb/>explained by several factors among them frequency of connections, price and personal <lb/>preferences. <lb/>Table 1. Travel time between city centers (point-to-point) by different modes of passenger <lb/>transport, accounting for access and waiting times, and for cars at 600 km <lb/>stopping for a short meal <lb/>Mode <lb/>Average <lb/>speed, km/h <lb/>Distance city center to city center <lb/>400 km <lb/>500 km <lb/>600 km <lb/>Passenger car <lb/>100 <lb/>4:00 <lb/>5:00 <lb/>6:30 <lb/>Coach <lb/>85 <lb/>4:43 <lb/>5:53 <lb/>7:34 <lb/>Fast train <lb/>150 <lb/>2:40 <lb/>3:20 <lb/>4:00 <lb/>High speed train <lb/>280 <lb/>1:26 <lb/>1:47 <lb/>2:09 <lb/>Aircraft <lb/>800 <lb/>2:20 <lb/>2:28 <lb/>2:35 <lb/>As most central stations are located down-town, an advantage of travelling by rail is that the <lb/>journey takes you from city center to city center. However, all passengers to not have a down-<lb/>town location as their point of departure or a final destination that is located in or close to a <lb/>city center. For them the total travel-time may be shorter by a combination of aviation and a <lb/>rental car or a taxi. A shift from fast to high-speed train may or may not make a difference for <lb/>this type of customer. The difference in travel time is small already when travelling from city <lb/>center to city center. <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/></body>

			<body>Environmental aspects <lb/>Transport affects the environment in numerous ways. The most important parameters in the <lb/>context of intercity passenger traffic are exhaust emissions (NO x , SO x , PM and VOC), noise, <lb/>and climate change. Land-use, including intrusion and barrier effects, may also be important. <lb/>Calculating the environmental effects of different ways of moving people must in the context <lb/>of infrastructure planning and investment take account of the anticipated technological <lb/>development during the depreciation period and the step-wise enforcement of more stringent <lb/>environment standards. The correct way of doing this would be to calculate the cost of <lb/>emissions year-by-year and to translate future costs to present day value by a discount rate. In <lb/>a world of fast technological development, the outcome to a large extent depends on the <lb/>length of the depreciation period and the choice of discount rate. A long period in <lb/>combination with a low discount rate (e.g. 60 years and 2 or 3%) gives a high weight to <lb/>future, more environmentally benign technologies, while a high discount rate, say 4-6 per <lb/>cent, means that the results are much influenced by the current, relatively large, differences <lb/>between the modes. The general expectation among experts is that these differences will <lb/>diminish over-time as all modes need to become cleaner and more energy efficient. <lb/>However, no expert can tell us what new vehicles and engines will look like 30 or 50 years <lb/>ahead. At best they can forecast with some degree of accuracy what designs and engines that <lb/>will dominate the production of new vessels and vehicles 10 or 15 years from now. Given that <lb/>trains and aircraft tend to become 25 to 30 years before being scrapped, most vessels <lb/>produced in, say, 2025 will still be used in 2045, which is 36 years from now. However, by <lb/>then these vessels will only make up a small part of the total fleet. The life of cars and buses <lb/>are shorter but newly produced passenger cars may on average become 15-20 years old before <lb/>being replaced. Electric vehicles, that have very durable engines and transmission systems, <lb/>may in future become even older. <lb/>One way around the problem with unknown future technologies and the choice of discount <lb/>rate may be to base the evaluation of the long-term environmental performance of the <lb/>different modes on what might be the best available technology in 2025, 16 years from now. <lb/>The assumption would then be that these technologies will dominate transport at mid-term of <lb/>the depreciation period and may be taken as a proxy for the environmental impact of a mode <lb/>over an entire period of 50-60 years. In the following sections this simplified method is used <lb/>for producing a rough picture of the long-term differences in environmental impact per <lb/>passenger kilometer. <lb/>Tailpipe emissions <lb/>Regulated exhaust emissions occur from all types of internal combustion engines as well as <lb/>from power plants that use fossil fuels or biofuel. The maximum permissible tailpipe <lb/>emissions from cars and buses have been drastically reduced over the last 15 years and will <lb/>continue to decline. By 2025, new vehicles may be expected to emit so little that the <lb/>aggregated impact from the entire new fleet is negligible. However, as cars and buses have <lb/></body>

			<body>operating lives of 15-20 years, it will take until about 2035 for the total fleet to be clean. By <lb/>then the share of electric road vehicles and plug-in electric hybrid cars may also be <lb/>substantial. <lb/>The electricity used by trains, and in the future by a growing number of cars, is marginally <lb/>produced in coal-fired power plants, and in most countries such plants dominate the grid. <lb/>Some power plants still emit huge quantities of sulphur and NO x . Several European power <lb/>plants, most of them located in Eastern Europe currently emit more than 100,000 tons of SO 2 <lb/>at thermal capacities ranging from 800 to 12,000 MW, and a number of plants, most of them <lb/>British, emit more than 20,000 tons of NO x per year (Entec, 2008). This means that the worst <lb/>emit more than 20 gram SO 2 and 3 gram NO x per kilowatt-hour produced. However, by 2025 <lb/>such power plants will either have been decommissioned or have had to clean up their <lb/>operations. Thus in the longer term also the regulated emissions from power plants will have <lb/>been reduced to sustainable levels. <lb/>The assumption here is therefore that the remaining tailpipe emissions, if any, as well as those <lb/>originating from power production can be disregarded in a long-term comparison between the <lb/>land-based modes. <lb/>For aviation, the situation is more complicated. The emissions of NO x from aircraft are a <lb/>major long-term concern, however, primarily because of their contribution to climate change. <lb/>Emissions of NO x from airplanes will therefore be addressed in the below section on <lb/>greenhouse gases. <lb/>Noise <lb/>Problems associated with noise from vehicles and vessels are sight-specific. It is therefore <lb/>difficult or impossible to calculate average noise costs for different modes. However, a few <lb/>general observations can be made. Intercity journeys by car or bus usually takes place on <lb/>motorways or other high-standard roads that allow speeds of 90 km/h or more. At such speeds <lb/>the tire-to-surface noise dominates over engine noise, which means electrification of road <lb/>vehicles will have limited impact on equivalent noise levels. On the other hand, motorways <lb/>and other major roads are often built as to avoid crossing through minor towns and other <lb/>settlements. That means fewer people are victims of such road noise compared with noise <lb/>from railway lines which for historical reasons were often designed to go through the heart of <lb/>towns. However, new high speed lines may also avoid crossing through smaller towns where <lb/>no stop is made anyway. <lb/>A 50 per cent reduction of external noise from trains and aircraft appears to be technologically <lb/>possible. Additional improvement can be achieved by using noise-absorbing road surface <lb/>materials or install absorbents close to the railway track. Shielding by noise-protection walls <lb/>may significantly reduce the impact but only relatively close to the barrier. People living <lb/>further away will be affected by the diffuse background noise that barriers cannot stop. Where <lb/>aviation is concerned, the only way of shielding is by improved insulation, particularly of <lb/>windows. <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>7 <lb/>The noise created by large carriers amount to less per passenger kilometer compared with an <lb/>equally high sound from a smaller vehicle or vessel. Trains that can seat hundreds of <lb/>passenger therefore create less noise per passenger kilometer than cars even when making <lb/>much more noise when passing. However, in the road environment noise is dominated by <lb/>trucks. The marginal contribution of an additional car to an already busy road is small. <lb/>The conclusion is that the social marginal cost caused by traffic noise cannot be included in a <lb/>generalized comparison of the different modes. A shift from one mode to another may <lb/>increase or decrease the impact on human health depending on local circumstances. <lb/>Land use and landscape <lb/>The use of land and the impact on landscape is also to a large extent site-specific. However, <lb/>some general observations can be made. <lb/>Aviation, for natural reasons, consumes much less land per passenger kilometer than other <lb/>passenger transport modes. An additional flight generally does not cause any extra damage in <lb/>this sense while growing traffic volumes may after a while require an additional runway or <lb/>even a new airport. <lb/>Intercity traffic by car, bus or traditional intercity trains share infrastructure with vehicles <lb/>bound for other destinations and to some extent with local traffic. The marginal impact on <lb/>land-use is usually zero. It is only when congestion calls for additional infrastructure capacity <lb/>to be built that more intercity traffic will make a difference. If new capacity is created simply <lb/>by adding a new lane or track, the marginal effect on land-use is limited and no new barrier is <lb/>formed. <lb/>Introducing high-speed trains where no previous infrastructure for such trains exists requires a <lb/>new railway especially designed for this type of traffic. High speed traffic requires a layout <lb/>with large radius curves and limited gradients. 1 The horizontal curve radius must be at least <lb/>5.5 kilometers to accommodate speeds of 300 km/h, and should ideally not be less than 7 <lb/>kilometers (UIC, 2008a). 2 For these reasons high speed tracks are often built in new corridors <lb/>although partial location to existing railway or motorway corridors is sometimes possible. <lb/>This means new land is occupied and new barriers are created. <lb/>A potential side-effect of building a new line for high speed trains is that more room is left for <lb/>other types of train on the pre-existing rail infrastructure. Proponents of high speed rail often <lb/>claim that the creation of new corridors makes an expansion of goods transport by train <lb/>possible in otherwise congested railway systems. An indirect effect of this may be that a shift <lb/>from road to track will reduce the overall environmental impact of freight transport. However, <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 However, high speed trains can tolerate somewhat steeper gradients than conventional trains. <lb/>2 For speeds of 200 km/h a curve radius of 2.5 km is sufficient (and 3.5 ideal). <lb/></note>

			<body>8 <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>for this to happen there must be a latent demand for transport by rail that could previously not <lb/>be met for lack of capacity. <lb/>Theoretically, rail because of the high capacity of trains require much less land for a given <lb/>number of passenger than roads (although buses require less space than cars). However, to be <lb/>able to make maximum use of this advantage all trains should run at the same speed and stop <lb/>at the same stations. Mixing fast and slow trains with each other, and passenger trains with <lb/>freight trains, may significantly reduce the actual capacity of a railway corridor. <lb/>Climate change <lb/>The transport sector&apos;s contribution to climate change appears to be the only environmental <lb/>parameter of great concern in a long-term perspective. The remaining part of this paper will <lb/>therefore be devoted to the question of whether modal shift in intercity passenger transport <lb/>would do the climate any good. It starts with providing current data and assumptions <lb/>concerning the future energy-efficiency of the various modes. It then discusses the issue of <lb/>how to calculate the short-term marginal effect on greenhouse gas emissions, and finally goes <lb/>on to analyze the impact on actual emissions of load factors. <lb/>Calculating carbon emissions well-to-wheel is a complicated matter. In this short paper the <lb/>comparison between emissions, direct or indirect, from rail, road and aviation are based on <lb/>tank-to-wheels for diesel and gasoline cars and on fuel-to-electricity for electric trains and <lb/>cars. This means that for road and aviation fuels, the extraction, refining and delivery of fuels <lb/>to gas stations have been omitted, and for electricity, the extraction and transport of coal to <lb/>the power stations as well as any grid-losses. In both cases these emissions amount to 10-15 <lb/>per cent of the well-to-wheel emissions. <lb/>Electric trains <lb/>Modern fast passenger trains travelling at a medium speed of 150 km/h use 0.031 to 0.045 <lb/>kWh per seat kilometer (Lukaszewicz and Andersson, 2006), while high speed trains at <lb/>service speeds of around 250 km/h require 0.041 to 0.065 kWh per seat kilometer (RSSB, <lb/>2007). The Japanese Shinkansen 700 consumes as little as 0.029 kWh due to a wide-body and <lb/>large train length which results in more seats per length meter and a very high total number of <lb/>seats. As the gauge in many countries, notably in most of Europe, does not allow wide-bodies <lb/>that can seat 2+3 passengers, the following sections focus on trains that seat 2+2 passengers. <lb/>Passenger trains need energy for: <lb/>accelerating up to speed <lb/>overcoming resistance to movement <lb/>climbing gradients <lb/>powering control systems <lb/>lighting, heating, cooling and ventilating the carriages <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>9 <lb/>The energy needed for accelerating up to speed is defined by the weight (mass) of the train <lb/>and the speed. This kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed and so does the <lb/>aerodynamic resistance, i.e. the drag needed to push the train through the air (UIC, 2008b). <lb/>Therefore moving the train at 300 km/h will require four times the energy needed for a trip in <lb/>150 km/h (all else equal). <lb/>The rail sector is committed to reducing the average electricity consumption by different types <lb/>of trains by investing in new technologies and by making operations more fuel-efficient. <lb/>CER, the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies has committed to <lb/>an overall reduction of 30 per cent in CO 2 emissions per passenger and ton kilometer between <lb/>1990 and 2020. The companies will make use of new or improved technologies as well as <lb/> &quot; Eco-driving &quot; , active traffic management and efficient timetabling (UIC, 2008b). <lb/>Some railway companies have already achieved reductions of this magnitude. In the UK the <lb/>specific primary energy consumption in passenger rail transport fell by 25 per cent between <lb/>1995 and 2006, and Deutsche Bahn reports reductions by one third between 1990 and 2007 <lb/>for both freight and regional passenger traffic (UIC and CER, 2008). However, the primary <lb/>energy consumption in passenger long distance traffic was not reduced at all, presumably <lb/>reflecting a shift to higher average speed. <lb/>Actual consumption per seat kilometer depends on: <lb/>Train length <lb/>Number of seats per length meter <lb/>Aerodynamics <lb/>Weight <lb/>Tunnel length and tunnel diameter <lb/>Average speed and top speed <lb/>Number of stops and accelerations/decelerations due to changing speed limits <lb/>Engine efficiency and degree of regenerative braking <lb/>Reducing air drag is the single most important measure for cutting electricity consumption at <lb/>high speeds. Nose and tail need to be adequately streamlined. Bogie shielding, removal or <lb/>shielding of roof-based equipment and closing inter-car gaps are other measure of importance. <lb/>Much of this is cost-effective already at speeds between 150 or 200 km/h and should be <lb/>demanded by any cost-conscious operator and delivered by all train manufacturers. However, <lb/>the fact that energy consumption (all else equal) rises dramatically with speed indicates that <lb/>there may be some very expensive measures that pay-off only in high speed trains. <lb/>The impact of tunnels on aerodynamic resistance depends on the narrowness of the tunnel <lb/>area and is larger for single-track than for double-track tunnels. If tunnels make up 10 per cent <lb/>of the distance of a high speed line they may increase overall air drag by around 8 per cent <lb/>and the overall energy consumption by 5 per cent. <lb/>10 <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>The number of seats per length meter is also highly relevant for energy consumption (at any <lb/>speed).Travelling at high speed over medium distances may allow the operator to save some <lb/>space by substituting a bistro or restaurant car by trolley catering. <lb/>As shown in Table 2, the estimates of the difference in energy consumption between <lb/>conventional intercity trains and high speed trains vary considerably. High speed trains are <lb/>said to require anything from 9 to 150 per cent more energy per seat km. <lb/>Table 2.

According to Network Rail (2009), running resistance <lb/>accounts for 68 per cent of the energy consumed by an intercity train, while inertia and <lb/>comfort functions make up respectively 10 and 22 per cent. The two latter will not change <lb/>much with increasing speed for a point-to-point service. As running resistance at speeds <lb/>above 200 km/h is dominated by drag, which increases with approximately the square of the <lb/>speed, it seems reasonable to assume that increasing the service speed from 200 to 300 km/h <lb/>should raise electricity consumption by about 85 per cent, all else equal. This is close to <lb/>figures given by Zängl (1993), who says that a German ICE running at 300 km/h (constant <lb/>speed) would require 83 per cent more energy per seat km than when the same train travels at <lb/>200 km/h. <lb/>The author of this paper has searched, in vain, the literature for marginal cost curves for <lb/>technical measures that improve the fuel-efficiency of passenger trains, and he has in addition <lb/>consulted experts without getting an answer to his question concerning how much more could <lb/>be done on high speed trains compared to new conventional trains. However, the marginal <lb/>cost curve for reducing air drag most likely is rather flat. 3 <lb/></body>

			<body>The difference between what can be done to reduce the consumption of a high speed train <lb/>compared to conventional fast trains will be a result of the former being able to accept a <lb/>higher marginal abatement cost and/or of a difference in train length or seats per length meter. <lb/>However, the latter, assuming that operators attempt to maximise profits, would only be a <lb/>result of substituting a restaurant by a trolley service, assuming that passengers can content <lb/>themselves with the latter when the travelling time is short. Where train length is concerned, <lb/>operators can choose to meet the higher demand for the high speed train compared to <lb/>traditional services either by adding cars or by offering more frequent services (or possibly a <lb/>combination). <lb/>Based on the above argumentation, it is assumed that the difference in seat km energy <lb/>consumption between future 200 km/h IC trains and 300 km/h high speed trains may be in the <lb/>order of 40 to 50 per cent, assuming the same number of intermediate stops. The assumption <lb/>is that most of the reduction compared with the all-else-equal case comes from making the <lb/>high speed train longer than the conventional train. In the sections below it is assumed that <lb/>trains with such top speeds will on average run at respectively 150 and 280 km/h due to track <lb/>restraints. <lb/>Diverting traffic from an existing line where the service speed is 150 km/h to a new high <lb/>speed line that allows an average speed of 280 km/h would make energy use per seat km <lb/>increase by at least 60 per cent (assuming use of modern technologies in both cases). The <lb/>effect on air drag from 10 per cent tunneling is also considered in this choice of mark-up for <lb/>high speed electricity consumption. In the calculations below, the new 2025 fast train is <lb/>assumed to consume 0.018 kWh per seat km (150 km/h), while the high speed trains uses <lb/>0.029 kWh (280 km/h). <lb/>The issue of how electricity consumption affects CO 2 emissions is discussed in a later section. <lb/>Aviation <lb/>Modern commercial aircraft use on average between 0.029 and 0.039 liters per seat km. 4 <lb/>Short-range aircraft, however, burn significantly more than long distance flights. <lb/>Substantial improvements in airframe design and engine efficiency as well as wide-scale use <lb/>of composite materials to reduce weight is expected to take place in the next few decades. <lb/> &quot; Clean Sky &quot; is a R&amp;D program under the European Commission&apos;s Seventh Research <lb/>Framework Program. According to the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in <lb/>Europe (ACARE), the greening of air transport means developing technologies to reduce the <lb/>environmental impact of aviation with the aim of halving the amount of CO 2 emitted by air <lb/>transport, cutting specific emissions NO x by 80 per cent.

			<body>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is much less optimistic but believes that <lb/>it should be possible to reach 1.5 per cent average annual improvement in fuel efficiency to <lb/>2020. 5 The difference between ACARE and IATA can probably be explained, at least <lb/>partially, by ACARE&apos;s focus on new technologies. IATA&apos;s target appears to concern fleet <lb/>averages. <lb/>Based on Easyjet&apos;s Corporate Responsibility Report 2006, ATOC (2009) estimates that flying <lb/>a new Airbus A319 causes CO 2 emissions of about 115 g per seat km for a 300 km flight and <lb/>85 g for a flight twice that long. This corresponds to 0.046 and 0.034 liter of kerosene <lb/>respectively. Boeing claims that the new 7E7 &quot; Dreamliner &quot; will require only 0.017 liters per <lb/>seat km, while Airbus says the A380 will consume less than three liters per 100 passenger km <lb/>(RSSB, 2007). Assuming a 70 per cent load factor, the latter means 0.021 liter per seat km. <lb/>However, these figures are for long flights. One might have to multiply by 1.5 to arrive at <lb/>figures that correspond to the fuel consumption of short-hauls (RSSB, 2007) <lb/>ATOC (2009), referring to work done for the British Committee on Climate Change, thinks <lb/>that CO 2 emissions from short-haul flights can be reduced by 35 per cent by 2025 compared <lb/>with 2006, resulting in 62 g CO 2 per seat km. This corresponds to 0.025 liters per seat km and <lb/>is the value that will be used in this report. It should be recognized that shifting from jets to <lb/>turbo-props would reduce fuel consumption further, however, at the price of lower speed. <lb/>Aircraft emit several other gases and substances that contribute to global warming, among <lb/>them NO x , water vapor and particles that form ozone and contrails and may contribute to the <lb/>formation of cirrus clouds. To take account of this contribution, the aggregated impact of <lb/>aviation is sometimes calculated by multiplying the radiative forcing of the aircraft&apos;s CO 2 <lb/>emission by a factor of 1.5-2.5. An earlier study by the IPCC (1999) even suggested a factor <lb/>of 2.7. However, technological development will reduce these emissions substantially until <lb/>2025, where NO x is concerned probably more than CO 2 . Of relevance in the context of <lb/>short-distance flights is also that the aircraft cruises at high altitude during a relatively short <lb/>part of its journey and often does not reach the tropopause at all. Therefore it makes sense to <lb/>use a relatively low factor. Econ (2008) suggests factor 1.3 but this report will use factor 1.5. <lb/>Passenger cars <lb/>New cars sold in Europe in 2008 on average emitted 154 gram CO 2 per kilometer when <lb/>driven according to the official EU test cycle. Emissions in real traffic are probably higher, in <lb/>particular in areas plagued by congestion. An EU directive limits emissions from new cars of <lb/>average size (weight) in 2015 to 130 g/km and indicates that the limit may be as low as <lb/>95 g/km by 2020. The assumption here is thus that new fossil-fuelled cars, including electric <lb/>5 <lb/>Airlines present climate change proposals to heads of governments. Press release 22 September 2009. <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>13 <lb/>hybrids, may on average emit 85 gram in 2025 when driven as prescribed by the European <lb/>test cycle. However, emissions in intercity traffic may differ a bit from those resulting from <lb/>the test. <lb/>Speed has a large impact on fuel consumption, not only in trains, but in any type of vehicle or <lb/>vessel. Tests made by the Swedish National Road Administration (2000-2001 models) <lb/>indicate that emissions at constant speed are 30 per cent higher at 110 km/h compared to <lb/>70 km/h. Nevertheless, today´s cars emit more in the urban part of the test-cycle than in the <lb/>part that represents driving in rural areas. This, however, may change when most cars are <lb/>equipped with start-stop functions and systems for regeneration of braking energy. The use of <lb/>full hybrids will have a much greater impact on fuel consumption in urban driving than on the <lb/>highway. In the long-term the difference in average fuel consumption between the urban and <lb/>the rural part of the test cycle is likely to be small. <lb/>In addition, one should be aware that the rural part of the cycle does not include much of <lb/>motorway speeds. On the other hand, modern future cars will be equipped with cruise control <lb/>and other assists that help the driver to keep the speed constant, thereby avoiding the <lb/>efficiency losses associated with variations in speed. Therefore the assumption here is that the <lb/>average new fossil-fuelled car will in 2025 emit 105 gram CO 2 per km when driven on non-<lb/>congested motorways where the speed-limit is 120 km/h and the average speed is around <lb/>110 km/h. This represents a level 24 per cent above the assumed emission limit when new <lb/>cars in 2025 are driven according to the test cycle and equals 21 gram per seat km. <lb/>Plug-in electric hybrids and all-electric battery cars that are charged from the grid may <lb/>become common by 2025. Provided that air drag and rolling resistance are similar to those of <lb/>the fossil-fuelled cars of the same vehicle generation, one may expect these electric vehicles <lb/>to consume on average around 0.15 kWh per km when driven according to the European test <lb/>cycle (King, 2007, and Hacker et al, 2009. Under motorway conditions the specific <lb/>consumption may increase to 0.19 or 0.20 kWh per km. Thus, this paper assumes that the <lb/>average consumption when used for intercity journeys will be 0.2 kWh per vehicle km and <lb/>0.04 kWh per seat km. The issue of how grid electricity affects CO 2 emissions is discussed in <lb/>a later section. <lb/>Long-distance buses <lb/>Megabus, a British company, reports an average fuel consumption of 0.577 liter per km for its <lb/>double-deck Stagecoach Megabus, presumably under rather mixed traffic conditions (no <lb/>details provided). 6 This equals 0.0063 liters per seat km. Norges Naturvernforbund (2008), <lb/>based on data from Volvo, says that an annual average for the Volvo 9700 when used in <lb/>intercity traffic is 0.28 liters per vehicle km. This corresponds to 0.0054 liters per seat km. <lb/></body>

			<body>14 <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>The current long-term potential for improvement appears to be in the order of 25 per cent. 7 <lb/>This translates into 0.21 liters per vehicle km for a new bus in 2025 when travelling on <lb/>motorways with little variation in speed and making few stops. This means 0.0040 liters per <lb/>seat km and 10.5 gram CO 2 per seat km. Eco-driving may reduce fuel consumption further but <lb/>is not accounted for here. <lb/>Emissions indirectly caused by electricity consumption <lb/>When comparing the impact of different modes, studies often use average power production <lb/>emission figures for electric trains assuming that they run on that mix. This may be correct <lb/>when wanting to illustrate the actual impact of traffic during a given (historical) year. <lb/>However, when the task is to analyze the consequences of investments made to facilitate <lb/>modal shift, it is necessary to base the assessment on the marginal effects on production and <lb/>emissions from growing or declining demand. <lb/>Growing demand for electricity may coincide with a growing number of windmills and other <lb/>carbon-free means of power production, but in most countries and regions coal-fired <lb/>condensing stations will remain the marginal form of production for the foreseeable future. <lb/>That means under normal conditions that any change in demand will either increase or <lb/>decrease the use of coal or lignite. A successful and large scale introduction of Carbon <lb/>Capture and Storage (CCS) may in the long term change this, but it is currently impossible to <lb/>know to what extent this method will be used by 2025. In the absence of CCS that covers all <lb/>fossil-fuelled power stations connected to a grid, any increase in demand will, in the short to <lb/>medium term, slow down the replacement of coal by more environmentally benign sources of <lb/>electricity. <lb/>In this context it is also necessary to note the outcome of shrinking demand for electricity on <lb/>emissions of CO 2 , regardless of whether demand is declining as a result of a recession or <lb/>because of energy efficiency improvements. Short term, the power plant with the highest <lb/>variable production cost would be the unit to close first. This will, especially under emissions <lb/>trading, normally be plants that use lignite or hard coal. Wind mills and hydro power stations <lb/>would not reduce production in a situation of diminishing demand. For this reason the <lb/>European Union&apos;s Directive on Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services <lb/>(2006/32/EC) recommends that the effect of electricity efficiency improvements should be <lb/>multiplied by 2.5 to reflect the reduction in primary energy consumption. 8 It would be very <lb/>strange, indeed, to use marginal figures when demand is shrinking, and average figures in <lb/>situations of increasing demand. However, this is what the rail industry sometimes does. <lb/>From the above it is obvious that in a system-perspective a shift from aircraft, cars and buses <lb/>to electric trains would reduce demand for kerosene, diesel and gasoline and increase the use <lb/>of coal and gas. <lb/>7 <lb/>Edward Jobson, AB Volvo, personal communication. <lb/>8 <lb/>2.5 equals an electricity efficiency of 40% which is normal in coal-fired condensing power stations. <lb/>P.

			<body>Some argue that the introduction of carbon dioxide emissions trading means that taking the <lb/>marginal effect into account has become obsolete. The emissions will not be allowed to <lb/>exceed the cap no matter how much demand for electricity increases. The only effect would <lb/>be that scarcity will make the price of allowances rise. This way of arguing would be <lb/>reasonable if the cap was set to reflect the final target of cutting the carbon emissions of <lb/>Annex 1 countries by 80 or 90 per cent below their 1990-levels. However, the caps under <lb/>discussion in Europe and the United States are intermediate targets for 2020 that are only the <lb/>first steps on a long journey to sustainability. <lb/>If scarcity leads to a fast increase in the equilibrium price of carbon, there is reason to fear <lb/>that politicians may deviate from their current long-term plans. A high or fast rising price may <lb/>make them hesitate about the future of the cap-and-trade systems, and the caps of the next <lb/>stage might be set higher than would have been the case at a lower price of carbon (WWF, <lb/>2009). <lb/>Another difficulty in the context of emissions trading is that the European Emissions Trading <lb/>System (EU ETS) covers CO 2 emissions from power production but not emissions caused by <lb/>cars and buses. Aviation will be included from 2012. In contrast, the proposed American <lb/>scheme (The Waxman-Markey Bill) 9 covers not only fossil energy used in power production <lb/>but also emissions from fuels delivered to any mode of transportation (by an up-stream <lb/>approach). As all emissions from transportation are subject to the scheme, one could argue <lb/>that any expansion of demand for road fuels could not alter the cap. If so there would be no <lb/>need to worry about gas-guzzling SUVs. However, also in this case there is an evident risk <lb/>that a high price will prevent future politicians from following the route outlined in the bill, <lb/>which says emissions should be cut by 80 per cent by 2050 from 2005 levels. <lb/>A claim that cap-and-trade systems reduce the marginal climate effect to zero can under no <lb/>circumstances be used on only one mode of transport (rail), and if used on all, there would be <lb/>no ground for the rail sector to claim that high speed rail has an environmental advantage over <lb/>road and aviation as the effect of modal shift on greenhouse gases would by definition always <lb/>be zero. The conclusion here is therefore that the marginal long-term effect on greenhouse <lb/>gases is the most suitable way of comparing the environmental performance of transport by <lb/>different modes. <lb/>In power production the marginal emissions may differ somewhat depending on whether hard <lb/>coal or lignite is used and whether coal is sometimes replaced by natural gas as the marginal <lb/>source of production. In some systems other means of production may temporarily replace <lb/>coal, for instance during periods of low demand or periods of high production in hydro power <lb/>stations. The efficiency of marginally used coal-fired power plants may also differ from time <lb/>to time and from grid to grid. <lb/>A successful climate change mitigation policy will require that coal-fired power plants are <lb/>gradually phased out or alternatively equipped with CCS. In this paper the use of lignite is <lb/>assumed to have been terminated by 2025 (or equipped with CCS).

			<body>natural gas may have replaced hard coal or all hard coal-fired plants may have installed CCS. <lb/>In a successful climate change policy, aiming at 80 per cent reduction by 2050, hard coal <lb/>(without CCS) may have been phased out by 2035 and replaced by renewable energy, nuclear <lb/>power and natural gas. The latter would then be the new marginal production fuel. <lb/>In order to reflect emissions during an entire depreciation period of 50 years for investment in <lb/>new rail infrastructure one might assume hard coal to be the marginal production fuel during <lb/>the first two decades and natural gas during the last three. Electricity produced in a coal-fired <lb/>condensing station with 40 per cent production efficiency gives rise to an emission of about <lb/>800 gram CO 2 per kWh electricity produced, while natural gas used in a plant with 58 per <lb/>cent efficiency emits 350 gram per kWh electricity. This gives an average of 530 gram per <lb/>kWh for the entire period. This figure disregards the fact that one may have good reasons to <lb/>give higher weight to emissions in the near future compared to those produced 30 or 40 years <lb/>from now. <lb/>Alternative estimates may be plausible and should, of course, be applied equally on both <lb/>electric trains and road vehicles that use grid electricity. <lb/>Marginal effects of increasing demand for fossil fuels <lb/>Carbon free fuels and low-carbon fuels are also in limited supply. The global potential for <lb/>producing first and second generation biofuels is much smaller than current demand for <lb/>conventional fuels. This means any change in demand for road fuels will either increase or <lb/>decrease the use of fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Aviation is even more dependent <lb/>on petroleum-based fuels. As fossil fuels are more easily substituted in other applications, <lb/>they are under emissions trading (or equal taxation) bound to be the last to be phased out. <lb/>However, the European Community requires all Member States to deliver 10 per cent of the <lb/>demand for road fuels in 2020 in the form of biofuels or electricity. Most States are expected <lb/>to respond by making the oil companies market diesel or gasoline that is blended with <lb/>renewable fuels such as biodiesel or ethanol. This low-blend may over time increase <lb/>somewhat. The assumption here is therefore that a mandatory blend of 20 per cent biofuel and <lb/>80 per cent diesel or gasoline is the typical marginal road fuel during the depreciation period. <lb/>The below calculation is based on the assumption that the biofuels will reduce well-to-wheel <lb/>emissions by 65 per cent (i.e. 0.65 x 0.2 = 0.13). The fact that some cars and buses may run to <lb/>100 per cent on biofuel is disregarded as focus is on the marginal effect on a system level. <lb/>In the longer term there is an obvious risk, from a climate perspective, that scarcity pricing of <lb/>oil products will provide incentive for ventures in production of un-conventional oils from tar <lb/>sands and shales. The Economist reports a continuing high investment in Canadian tar sand <lb/>despite the financial crises. 10 <lb/></body>

			<body>However, in countries and states where the government has adopted regulations that force the <lb/>oil companies to reduce the overall carbon intensity of the entire production chain, <lb/>unconventional oil is very unlikely to get a foothold. Gradually lowering the caps of trading <lb/>schemes will also make it difficult for these fuels to enter the market. They are therefore <lb/>disregarded in the context of this paper. <lb/>Future emission factors <lb/>Table 3 summarizes the results of the previous sections of this report and provides estimates <lb/>for the direct or indirect emissions of greenhouse gases from new vehicles and vessels by <lb/>2025. <lb/>Table 3.

This is due to the <lb/>assumption that it runs on 20 per cent biofuels. With 100 per cent diesel/gasoline the emission <lb/>would be 21 gram/seat km. <lb/>The reader should be aware that the above figures and the calculations carried out below <lb/>disregard emissions to and from airports and train stations. <lb/>Load factors <lb/>To be able to compare passenger modes with each other one has to take account of differences <lb/>in load factors. Today, on average 45-70 per cent of the seats are occupied in intercity trains <lb/>with no or few stops at intermediate stations. Traditional airlines appear to have cabin factors <lb/>around 70 per cent. Where high speed rail is concerned, Network Rail (2009) reports load <lb/>factors for 12 different services in four countries, ranging from 42 to 88 per cent, with a <lb/>median value of 64. Regional trains and long-distance buses that stop at many stations have <lb/>difficulties filling vehicles over the entire distance. They seldom reach load factors above 50 <lb/>per cent (de Rus and Nash, 2007) although Swebus, in fierce competition with regional and <lb/>fast trains, reports 56 per cent (2008) for its Stockholm-Gothenburg service. <lb/>However, new strategies are gathering ground. Low-cost airlines achieve high occupancy <lb/>rates by varying their prices, and traditional airlines and train operators are gradually learning <lb/>how to improve yield management. The below calculations are based on the assumption that <lb/>18 <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>the average load factor in 2025 is 80 per cent for regional aircraft, 75 per cent for high speed <lb/>trains, 65 per cent for conventional intercity trains and 55 per cent for long-distance <lb/>coaches. 11 The conventional intercity train is assumed (in the absence of a high speed service) <lb/>to make the same number of intermediate stops as the high speed train. The lower load factor <lb/>compared to high speed is explained by the fact that the latter will attract more passengers, <lb/>which will partly be used for offering more frequent services (see above) but will also to some <lb/>extent improve the average passenger density. <lb/>The differing load factors for conventional trains (150 km/h) and high speed trains (280 km/h) <lb/>means that the latter would only consume 41 per cent more energy per pkm, down from a <lb/>difference of 60 per cent per seat km. <lb/>In many countries, on average only 1.2-1.5 people occupy the five seats of a passenger car. <lb/>However, the occupancy rate is higher for long-distance journeys than for daily commuting <lb/>and other local trips. Colleagues tend to share cars when traveling to far away business <lb/>meetings, and families often choose cars before trains and aircraft when on holiday trips. <lb/>Studies of the effect on car travel of introducing high speed rail use average car occupancy <lb/>rates in the range of 1.5-2.2 persons (CCAP &amp; CNT, 2006, Econ 2008a, ATOC, 2009). Thus, <lb/>this paper assumes that on average 2.0 persons travel together in cars on intercity journeys (= <lb/>40% occupancy rate). <lb/>Table 4 shows the emissions from intercity journeys by new vessels and vehicles in 2025 <lb/>when account has been taken for the average load factor. <lb/>Table 4.

When considering <lb/>the effects on emissions of greenhouse gases from investing in new rail one must take account <lb/>of the following changes that may result from the investment: <lb/>11 <lb/>RSSB assumes 60 per cent for point-to-point services. <lb/>P.

			<body>Diminishing emissions due to shifts from aviation and road transport to rail <lb/>Increasing emissions due to higher train speeds <lb/>Additional emissions resulting from new journeys that are generated by new and faster <lb/>services <lb/>The use of free capacity on pre-existing tracks when a new line is built <lb/>The last issue concerns the opportunities of reducing emissions by using the old tracks for <lb/>extended freight transport and regional passenger traffic and will not be discussed here but in <lb/>a later section of report. <lb/>It may be worth observing that the generation of new journeys means that passengers now <lb/>spend their time and money on something that in the absence of high speed rail they would <lb/>have used for some other purpose. However, there is no way of knowing what they might <lb/>have done and what the carbon intensity of that activity would have been. It is therefore <lb/>disregarded. <lb/>The relative importance of the first three factors will depend on the circumstances in each <lb/>case. A high speed line that replaces a very inefficient line that only allows average speeds of <lb/>80 km will attract more new traffic than a line that is a supplement to or replacement for an <lb/>existing service in, say, 150 km/h. <lb/>The high speed line between Madrid and Seville (471 km) attracted 5.6 million travelers in <lb/>2000, seven years after it was opened. The market share for trains rose from 14 per cent in <lb/>1991 to 54 per cent, while aviation shrank from 11 to 4 per cent, cars from 60 to 34 and buses <lb/>from 15 to 8 per cent (Nelldal et al, 2003). However, at the same time the number of journeys <lb/>grew by an annual average of approximately 5 per cent, and as a consequence, the number of <lb/>trips by aviation, car and bus declined much less. The figures indicate that opening the new <lb/>line must have attracted a great deal of new journeys that would not in its absence have taken <lb/>place. High speed in combination with modest prices allows people to make trips that they <lb/>under previous circumstances would not have contemplated, for instance seeing friends more <lb/>often, having meetings instead of talking over the phone or attending football matches. <lb/>In the case of Madrid-Seville, travel time by train was cut by half, from 5 to 2.5 hours (UIC, <lb/>2008). Investment in high speed rail does not always result in such reduction. High speed <lb/>lines between Stockholm and Gothenburg (460 km) and Stockholm and Malmoe (615 km), <lb/>Sweden&apos;s three largest cities, are expected to cut travel times by respectively 27 and 44 per <lb/>cent (from 2:45 to 2:00 hours in the case of Stockholm-Gothenburg). An investigation on <lb/>behalf of the Swedish government (UOH, 2009) nevertheless thinks that the investment (a <lb/>combination of the two new lines) would result in: <lb/>7.7 billion more pkm by rail; <lb/>1.6 billion pkm less by aviation; <lb/>3.1 billion pkm less by car; <lb/>0.1 billion pkm less by bus. <lb/></body>

			<body>This means deviated traffic would amount to 4.8 billion pkm per year, and that the high speed <lb/>links would generate 2.9 billion pkm in the form of new intercity trips. The latter constitute <lb/>38 per cent of the total expected increase in passenger transport by rail. However, the high <lb/>figure for traffic diverted from cars could be put in question. Why would so many prefer rail <lb/>because of higher speed when the existing rail services between the three cities are already <lb/>substantially faster than the cars? <lb/>In a study for the Norwegian Government, VWI (2007) estimates that building a high-speed <lb/>link between Oslo and Trondheim (464 km) would result in the changes shown in Table 5. <lb/>Interestingly in this case, travel diverted from cars to rail is expected be quite small, and the <lb/>share that consists of new traffic is also smaller despite a more substantial travel time <lb/>reduction than in the Swedish case. <lb/>Table 5.

Such high figures for cars is presumably explained by the <lb/>fact that cars have a dominating position over medium distances in the United States and that <lb/>rail services in some cases do not really exist. <lb/>To be able to calculate how modal shift may affect emissions of greenhouse gases it is <lb/>necessary to make an assumption concerning the split between cars with internal combustion <lb/>engines and electric cars and plug-in hybrids. As the methodology of this paper is based on <lb/>the emissions from new vehicles in 2025, one must base the assumption on how new sales in <lb/>2025 may be divided on different types of engines. It is assumed that traditional cars <lb/>(including electric hybrids that cannot plug-in) make up 40 per cent of the market, plug-in <lb/>electric vehicles 40 per cent and all-electric cars 20 per cent.

			<body>of electricity on board, one must assume that only a tenth of an intercity journey by such a car <lb/>is in electric mode. Presumably many of the battery cars will be bought for local and regional <lb/>use rather than for long-distance journeys (some families will own more than one car). It thus <lb/>makes sense to suppose that these cars will represent less than 20 per cent of the intercity <lb/>traffic. We assume that the share is 10 per cent. That means that the share of grid electricity <lb/>will only be 14 per cent for new cars in 2025 and that the average emission per pkm will be <lb/>46.8 gram. <lb/>In order to get an idea of how investment in new rail infrastructure may affect emissions of <lb/>greenhouse gases a fictitious example is shown in table 6. It shows the result on emissions <lb/>some years after the inauguration of a new high speed line when the service speed increases <lb/>from 150 km/h on an existing line to 280 km/h. The example is based on the assumption that <lb/>traffic consists of 30 per cent pre-existent train travelers, 20 per cent diverted from aviation, <lb/>20 per cent from cars and 5 per cent from buses. The remaining 25 per cent are assumed to be <lb/>newly generated. The table shows the result per 1 million one-way trips between cities located <lb/>500 km apart. <lb/>Table 6.

It would <lb/>not even add much to climate change mitigation in a case where the total number of annual <lb/>(one-way) journeys was 10 or 20 million. <lb/>The calculations behind table 6 disregard the fact that in some countries the existing rail <lb/>infrastructure can accommodate higher, wider or longer trains than normal in other parts of <lb/>the world. For instance, in Japan and Scandinavia the distance between the tracks is wide <lb/>22 <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>enough to allow for wide-body cars, which is generally not the case in Britain and continental <lb/>Europe. However, reducing high speed rail energy by 15 or 20 per cent would not change the <lb/>overall picture much. <lb/>Valuing CO 2 <lb/>The positive effect on climate change of investing in modal shift depends to some extent on <lb/>the value put on carbon. <lb/>Provided that cap-and-trade systems become a favored method for limiting the emissions of <lb/>greenhouse gases and that these systems are linked to each other, there will in future be a <lb/>(more or less) global price on CO 2 . The economic value of achieving net reductions by <lb/>investing in modal shift will thus depend on the future price of carbon. Depending on the <lb/>stringency of the caps and technological development the long-term price may fall anywhere <lb/>in the range of $30-80 per ton. However, by 2025 it is less likely to be much higher than <lb/>$40-50 per ton CO 2 . That means that the socio-economic benefit from reducing emissions as <lb/>indicated in Table 6 would only amount to $7.0-8.8 million when total annual traffic amounts <lb/>to 20 million journeys per annum. <lb/>Sensitivity analysis <lb/>Varying some of the main parameters 10 per cent up or down does not provide results that <lb/>differ enough from the main calculation to justify a differing conclusion. Not even combining <lb/>several optimistic assumptions in favor of high speed rail makes much difference. Reducing <lb/>the marginal climate effect from electricity consumption by half and raising the share of total <lb/>traffic that is diverted from aviation to 30 per cent (and reducing the car share to 10%) would <lb/>in combination reduce emissions for every one million trips to 16,167 ton CO 2 . Assuming <lb/>very high figures for air traffic diversion does not make sense. It is not possible to replace <lb/>more than 100 per cent of aviation and in most cases airlines will be able to keep 20 or 30 per <lb/>cent of their customers. Assuming fewer generated journeys means emissions will fall <lb/>somewhat, but at the same time an important part of the market for high speed rail disappears. <lb/>Not even disregarding completely the environmental impact of electricity consumption (as the <lb/>Swedish Rail Administration wants it) would reduce emissions per one million single <lb/>journeys by more than 16,000 to 20,000 ton, depending on whether the share diverted from <lb/>aviation is set at 20 or 30 per cent. Multiplying the highest figure by 10 or 20 to get the annual <lb/>contribution from a high speed line does not add up to more than approximately 0.2 to <lb/>0.4 million tons per year. <lb/>Calculating the emissions year by year throughout the entire depreciation period of the new <lb/>infrastructure and discounting the cost to present day net value might produce a differing <lb/>result, especially at a high discount rate. The marginal CO 2 emissions from electricity <lb/>production will probably be higher in the short term but the price of carbon will, on the other <lb/>hand, be lower. Using a shadow price on carbon may argue in favor of a rather high discount <lb/>rate as it is essential to start cutting emissions soon in order to avoid the earth from warming <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>23 <lb/>up too much. This rationale means that the environmental benefit of high speed rail <lb/>diminishes compared with the above example. <lb/>The calculations have been based on tank-to-wheel emissions and overhead wires-to-wheels, <lb/>plus the emissions from electricity production (disregarding emissions from coal and gas <lb/>extraction and grid losses). A well-to-wheel approach would not have produced significantly <lb/>different results, not even in a case when the well-tank/well-to-wire emissions were twice as <lb/>large for fuels than for electricity. <lb/>An important parameter that was disregarded in the above calculations is the impact on short-<lb/>term emissions of building a new railway line. Building a 500 km long high speed line may <lb/>cause emissions of several million ton CO 2eqv. (Norges Naturvernforbund, 2008, and Network <lb/>rail, 2009), and even if these emissions are balanced by reduced overall emissions in the <lb/>longer term, they do have a short-term impact on the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse <lb/>gases. There is thus an obvious risk that investment in high speed rail will add to the <lb/>difficulties of keeping the atmospheric content of greenhouse gases at a level that prevents the <lb/>mean global temperature from exceeding its pre-industrial level by more than 2 degrees <lb/>Celsius. From a climate point of view it might be better to up-grade existing lines and to try to <lb/>make people use modern telecommunications rather than investing lots of money in making <lb/>us travel more. <lb/>Make your own calculation <lb/>The author of this paper has made his best to provide detailed information concerning all of <lb/>the assumptions on which his calculations and conclusions are based. This allows the reader <lb/>to vary the assumptions according to his or her own beliefs and make his/her own calculation. <lb/>Freeing space for freight transport -the Swedish case <lb/>Building a completely new high speed line means traffic will be diverted from the pre-<lb/>existing rail network. Thus capacity on those tracks can be used for other types of trains, <lb/>provided, of course, that demand for such services exist. The situation is often complex and <lb/>the optimal solution may differ greatly from case to case. The Swedish case discussed below <lb/>should just be seen as one example. <lb/>In Sweden, freeing capacity for freight transport is a major argument for constructing new <lb/>high speed lines between Stockholm and respectively Gothenburg and Malmoe. However, <lb/>before taking the step to invest in these high speed rail lines, there is cause to investigate <lb/>whether capacity problems in rail freight transport can be overcome by other and less <lb/>expensive measures. Improved signaling systems and investment in passing siding may <lb/>increase substantially the capacity of an existing track (Nilsson and Pydokke, 2009). <lb/>In the Swedish case, part of the congestion on the Stockholm-Gothenburg line is caused by <lb/>containers being transported across the country from the Port of Gothenburg. Most of the <lb/>containerized goods transported to and from the greater Stockholm area travel via <lb/>24 <lb/>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009 <lb/>Gothenburg, despite the fact that most of it comes from or is destined to far-off places like <lb/>China. The Port of Stockholm in now investing in a new container port, located close to the <lb/>open sea, in order to compete for this market. Hutchinson Port Holdings will run the terminal <lb/>in connection with its operations in Rotterdam. <lb/>In addition a greater part of goods entering or leaving northern Sweden could use short-sea <lb/>shipping. Improving the Swedish rail infrastructure at high cost does not make much sense so <lb/>long as the freight trains cannot continue through Denmark to destinations on the European <lb/>continent. There will be limited rail capacity over the Sound and Fehmarn Belt even after the <lb/>completion of the Fehmarn Belt Bridge (Rødby-Puttgarten) in 2018. <lb/>However, one restraint on short-sea shipping is that the government enforces fairway dues on <lb/>all ships calling at Swedish ports, and that these fees recover not only the short-term marginal <lb/>costs but also the fixed infrastructure costs. Freight trains, on the other side, enjoy Europe&apos;s <lb/>lowest track fees that do not even cover the short-term marginal cost, much less the costs <lb/>associated with expanding the infrastructure. Sweden could level the playing field by <lb/>enforcing the same principle of liability on all modes. This implies raising the track fee for <lb/>trains and introducing kilometre-charging on heavy goods vehicles, which several Member <lb/>States of the EU have already done or are in the process of doing. <lb/>The Swedish example does not apply to other countries or regions, unless they have similar <lb/>conditions. In other parts of the world other alternative solutions may be more relevant, for <lb/>instance increasing the use of inland-waterways and/or pipelines. &quot; Gigaliners &quot; fuelled by grid <lb/>electricity might be an option in regions where the motorways are not crowded. Electrifying a <lb/>motorway would not involve excessive cost or high emissions of CO 2 . <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>There is no cause to prohibit investment in high speed rail on environmental grounds so long <lb/>as the carbon gains made in traffic balances the emissions caused during construction. The rail <lb/>sector, however, often claims that investment in rail infrastructure will bring large <lb/>environmental benefits (Banverket, 2008, UNIFE 2008, UIC 2008). Independent research, on <lb/>the other hand, concludes that these benefits are not so important (de Rus, 2008, WSP and <lb/>KTH Järnvägsgruppen, 2008, Nilsson and Pydokke, 2009). The results of this report support <lb/>the latter view. <lb/>Investment in high speed rail cannot be expected to contribute much to climate change <lb/>mitigation. Investment in conventional fast trains may in some circumstances be significantly <lb/>more beneficial. It may be time for many environmentalists to reconsider their attitude to high <lb/>speed rail. While in some cases calling for huge investment in high speed rail, the <lb/>environmental organizations want speed restrictions for road vehicles to be tightened, aircraft <lb/>to be designed for lower speeds and ship operators to involve in slow-steaming. <lb/>The cost of building high speed lines is high, €9-40 million per km according to de Rus <lb/>(2008), and 12-30 million according to UIC (2008). de Rus puts the average cost at €18 <lb/></body>

			<body>million. Huge traffic volumes appear to be the only way to recover these costs. The principal <lb/>benefits of high speed rail are time savings, additional capacity and generated traffic. Wider <lb/>economic benefits may also be important, however, difficult to estimate. The strongest case <lb/>for high speed rail is where traffic volumes are high (de Rus and Nash, 2007). <lb/> &quot; Only under exceptional circumstances (a combination of low construction costs plus high <lb/>time savings) could a new HSR line be justified with a level of patronage below 6 million <lb/>passengers per annum in the opening year; with typical construction costs and timer savings, a <lb/>minimum figure of 9 million passengers per annum is likely to be needed &quot; (European <lb/>Commission, 2008). <lb/>The conclusion of this paper is that investment in high speed rail is under most circumstances <lb/>likely to reduce greenhouse gases from traffic compared to a situation when the line was not <lb/>built. The reduction, though, is small and it may take decades for it to compensate for the <lb/>emissions caused by construction. However, where capacity restraints and large transport <lb/>volumes justify investment in high speed rail this will not cause overall emissions to rise. <lb/>In cases where anticipated journey volumes are low it is not only difficult to justify the <lb/>investment in economical terms, but it may also be hard to defend the project from an <lb/>environmental point of view as it will take too long for traffic to offset the emissions caused <lb/>by building the line. Under such circumstances it may be better to upgrade an existing line to <lb/>accommodate for somewhat higher speeds as this would minimize emissions from <lb/>construction and cut emissions from train traffic compared to high speed rail. <lb/></body>
