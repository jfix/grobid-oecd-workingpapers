			<head>Belgium&apos;s Flemish government recently approved a EUR 1 billion investment in school infrastructure<lb/> through public-private partnerships, its first major initiative of this kind. The Flemish Community&apos;s<lb/> variant of public-private partnerships in school building allows the government to meet urgent needs<lb/> in the short run, but also to spread the costs over a longer period.<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the past few decades, investments in school infrastructure in Flanders have not been sufficient to<lb/> meet demands. According to the latest estimates, EUR 1.9 billion are needed, of which EUR 1.4 billion<lb/> must be financed by the Flemish government in respect of European legislation, compared to the 2005<lb/> budget for school infrastructure of only EUR 140 million. The regular budget clearly does not provide<lb/> enough funds to clear the existing backlog of necessary construction work.<lb/> The current Flemish government is allocating new funding for school building projects. The budget for<lb/> school construction is to increase by EUR 50 million in both 2006 and 2007 and by EUR 75 million in<lb/> 2008 and 2009. These funds will be used for regular investments (i.e. standard government subsidies<lb/> and budgets allocated directly to schools) and will prevent the backlog from growing further.<lb/></p>

			<p>Apart from this rise in regular investments, the Flemish government plans to eliminate the existing<lb/> backlog through alternative financing. To do so, the government will select a single consortium to be<lb/> responsible for the design, construction, financing and maintenance of all school building projects.<lb/> The consortium will consist of private financial partners (e.g. banks and insurance companies) with the<lb/> government representing 25%. The consortium will not own the buildings but will receive financial<lb/> compensation over a period of approximately 30 years in exchange for making the buildings available<lb/> to the schools.<lb/> The building projects themselves will be launched by means of separate tenders, in order to<lb/> guarantee best value for money through competition between several contractors and architects. A<lb/> special committee, representing the different stakeholder organisations in Flemish education, will be<lb/> responsible for deciding which projects are eligible for the new financing. This committee will first<lb/> define the selection criteria, paying close attention to design quality, sustainability and the role of the<lb/> school in the community. A government architect employed by the Ministry of the Flemish Community<lb/> will ensure the architectural quality of the projects. (See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.)<lb/> It is expected that there will be other advantages. All the investments will be made at nearly the same<lb/> time and by the single public-private consortium, leading to lower costs. Also as the government will<lb/> be in a stronger position to guarantee projects are carried out quickly, school boards will be relieved of<lb/> managing the building projects and will be able to fully concentrate on the provision of education.<lb/> The Flemish Minister of Work, Education and Training, Frank Vandenbroucke, expects that, from<lb/> 2008 on, EUR 250 million in school building projects can be completed every year. In the meantime,<lb/> the government is working to prepare projects – establishing regulations, naming the public-private<lb/></p>

			<p>AGIOn, the new Flemish Agency for Infrastructure in Education and successor of the DIGO (former<lb/> infrastructure agency for private and communal institutions), will participate in the public-private<lb/> consortium assuming 25% of the budget and will ensure that the design, construction, financing and<lb/> maintenance initiative is correctly implemented. The agency will also be in charge of the subsidies that<lb/> will enable schools to pay the long-term financial compensation to the public-private consortium.<lb/></p>

			<p>In difficult economic times, the investment is expected to give an important boost to the Flemish<lb/> Community&apos;s building sector.<lb/></p>
