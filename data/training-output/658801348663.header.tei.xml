	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Nothing ventured, nothing gained: the long-run fiscal reward of structural reforms<lb/></div>

	<p type="introduction">The recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact provides more leeway for EU governments to<lb/> temporarily breach the 3% deficit limit if this facilitates the implementation of initially expensive reforms. But<lb/> the implementation of this principle is not obvious as budgets would need to specify the initial and multi-annual<lb/> budgetary cost and benefit profile of reforms. Budgets should also be explicit about the fiscal cost of inaction to<lb/> allow a balanced judgment of countries&apos; trade-offs between the various options available. This paper first<lb/> assesses the information requirements to implement this new form of flexibility built into the Stability and<lb/> Growth Pact. It then provides simulation exercises to highlight the positive budgetary effects of coordinated<lb/> structural reforms in the euro area as well as the need for an adequate monetary policy response to make sure<lb/> that demand adjusts to the improved supply conditions swiftly. The budgetary gains would still depend on the<lb/> type of reform and their impact on employment and productivity. On the other hand, national policy initiatives<lb/> by a single country may only have a limited impact, especially in the short term and in the case of a large<lb/> country. Indeed, in monetary union, the strength of endogenous adjustment mechanisms appears to be weaker in<lb/> larger countries. Finally, the experience of New Zealand and Australia has shown that the longer-term benefits<lb/> of reforms both in terms of the budget and overall economic performance are significant. Even so, it is not easy<lb/> to disentangle the various forces at play. Fundamentally, structural reform and the implementation of smart<lb/> fiscal frameworks tend to go hand in hand – indeed may be two sides of the same coin.<lb/> JEL classification: E37, E62, E63, E65, H6, P52.<lb/> Key words: Monetary union, fiscal policy, structural reforms.<lb/> * * * * *<lb/> Résumé<lb/> Qui ne risque rien n&apos;a rien : les bénéfices budgétaires à long terme des réformes structurelles<lb/> ECO/WKP(2006)21</p>
