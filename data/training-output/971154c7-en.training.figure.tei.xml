            <figDesc>Finding out about local requirements for a business<lb/> In the USA, Business licenses and permit are found at every level of government (federal, state, region, county,<lb/> city). administrations seem largely to have made use of on-line portals to help businesses establish the nature and<lb/> scope of required permits and other requirements. The U.S. Small Business Administration provides a &quot; Business<lb/> Licenses and Permits tool &quot; which helps business identify the licenses and permits that they require and provides links<lb/> to web pages, application forms and instructions. The tool also includes links to portals for each of the fifty states.<lb/> In Australia, the Business License &amp; Information Service (ABLIS) provides location-specific information on<lb/> required state licenses and permits.<lb/> Most businesses require some form of local -municipal/regional/provincial -registration but<lb/> decentralization, deconcentration and devolution have often created cultural and technical barriers to<lb/> making these links.<lb/> The largest attempts to achieve this are the European Points of Single Contact which will be discussed<lb/> later.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>example, from 1 May 2015, India reduced the number of forms required to incorporate and start a<lb/> business to just one, INC-29. Until then, it had required a minimum of 8 forms with much duplication of<lb/> the information, including one each for a digital signature certificate, approval of the company name,<lb/> registration of the memorandum and articles of the company, approval of the registered office and a<lb/> separate form for every director. Since 2005, Norway has required all public registers and public administrations to use the data in the<lb/> Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities instead of asking businesses again for the data.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Government agencies will progressively recognise businesses by their NZBN. Linking information between these<lb/> agencies and businesses will also lead to improved data quality and reduced rework. Concerns raised during<lb/> consultation focused on maximising the benefits of the NZBN, while protecting the privacy of individuals in business,<lb/> such as sole traders.<lb/> The success of the NZBN depends on rapid uptake of the number by businesses and state sector agencies. This<lb/> is needed to build momentum for infrastructure development and private investment in commercial opportunities.<lb/> Otherwise it becomes another number, rather than the intended replacement for the many current identifiers.<lb/> Source: Cabinet Circular CO (16) 3 to all Departments, Ministerial Direction to Crown Entities issued under Section 107 of the Crown Entities Act 2004, NZBN regulatory impact statement, May 2014<lb/> Pillar 7: Make effective use of ICT</figDesc>

The next sizeable elements are labour<lb/> requirements e.g. social security. Can there be a single form? Can the business have common number for<lb/> the registrations – this could be a first step towards a unique business identifier? 3.2 Simplify fees and payment. Can there be a single payment and can one office collect fees on<lb/> behalf of all agencies? Does the One Stop Shop keep any of the fees?<lb/> 3.3 Where should the shops be and how will they be staffed? What is the appropriate<lb/> provincial/regional spread? Will offices be under national or sub-national control?<lb/> 3.4 How does the business get information about what they need to do? At the One Stop Shop,<lb/> online or from other lcoations?<lb/> 3.5 Can the business deal with just one person. Can they get help with filling in the form(s)?<lb/> 3.6 Set service standards. Set targets and establish monitoring needs. Make sure that it is possible<lb/> for businesses to give feedback and that there is a procedure for this to be meaningfully dealt with.<lb/> 3.7 Specify any computer system. Who will enter the data? Can the information be shared<lb/> electronically with other organisations; consider data security and future interconnection needs.<lb/> 3.8 Will there be an online filing option? This is the move from online information to transaction.<lb/> Will the online option include payment and transmission of certificates?
