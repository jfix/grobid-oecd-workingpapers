Parties could<lb/> agree shared direction of travel for all Parties over time, in terms of increasing the coverage of accounting<lb/> for key sources and sinks and increasing the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting. Countries in<lb/> a position to do so would be expected to advance over time towards higher IPCC tier approaches for<lb/> estimating emissions or removals from key categories.<lb/> Countries with low capacity for measuring and reporting could start by reporting GHG emissions from key<lb/> sources and sinks using the IPCC Tier 1 approach, which is the simplest approach and uses default emissions factors. Increasing use of country-specific emissions factors and remote sensing technologies<lb/> and other techniques could help to increase the accuracy of land sector data. Capacity building would be<lb/> needed to assist low-capacity countries to increase their reporting and accounting coverage over time.<lb/> Figure ES.1: A shared direction of travel for land sector accounting<lb/> This paper outlines possible short-term steps for COP 20, COP 21 and 2016-2020 that could put Parties on<lb/> a pathway towards realising the long-term vision. Some Parties may choose to include mitigation (and<lb/> potentially also adaptation) actions in the land sector as components of their intended nationally<lb/> determined contributions under the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action<lb/> (ADP). The nationally determined contributions that Parties choose to put forward could include economy-<lb/>wide contributions covering the land sector, sector-specific goals, goals relative to baselines or reference<lb/> levels, project-level actions, and individual policies and measures. At COP 20, Parties could agree to create<lb/> a formal work stream to discuss post-2020 land sector accounting issues, and decide the up-front<lb/> information to be provided alongside land sector contributions.<lb/> At COP 21 in 2015, a set of foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting could be<lb/> agreed that put Parties on a pathway towards the possible long-term vision outlined above. The foundations<lb/> for reporting could include agreement by all parties to use IPCC 2006 Guidelines for reporting GHG<lb/> inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals. The foundations for accounting could include:<lb/> agreement to expand the coverage of land sector accounting over time, with a view to achieving broad<lb/> coverage of key categories of anthropogenic sources and sinks in the land sector in all countries; that the<lb/> &quot; once in, always in &quot; accounting rule is to be applied in the post-2020 period; that both emissions and<lb/> removals are to be accounted for; and that there are to be technical assessments of reference levels (where<lb/> called for by the type of contribution or as part of technical corrections, e.g. for age-class effects in forests)<lb/> to increase confidence and build trust.<lb/> Elaboration of technical details relating to the land sector reporting and accounting framework could be<lb/> undertaken in the period 2016-2020. Issues remaining to be addressed after COP 21 could include: the<lb/> possible development of guidance for reference levels and intensity-based approaches for agriculture, as<lb/> ways to deal with legacy effects and address multiple policy objectives; treatment of removals due to<lb/> natural disturbances or indirect human effects; the approach to be used for identifying anthropogenic GHG<lb/> emissions and removals; and the potential role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms.<lb/> Quality and<lb/> accuracy of<lb/> data used for<lb/> accounting<lb/> Coverage of accounting for<lb/> key sources and sinks<lb/> Broad<lb/> Narrow<lb/> High IPCC tiers<lb/> Low IPCC tiers</table>

            <table>the IPCC guidance available to date specifically for the<lb/> land-related parts of GHG inventories.

Consistency between GHG inventories would be improved if<lb/> all Parties were use the IPCC 2006 Guidelines to prepare their inventories while using different IPCC tiers 6<lb/> for keys categories according to national capacities.<lb/> The IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories divide all land into six land categories. These categories are<lb/> forest land, cropland, grassland, settlements, wetlands and other land. A distinction is also made between<lb/> managed and unmanaged land, where managed land is defined as &quot; land where human interventions and<lb/> practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions &quot; (IPCC, 2006).<lb/> Conversions of managed land from one category to another are tracked. To compile the GHG inventory,<lb/> emissions and removals resulting from each land-use category are estimated, as well as emissions and<lb/> removals resulting from land-use changes. This approach is known as the &quot; land-based &quot; approach.<lb/> 5<lb/> Many non-Annex I countries are undertaking REDD+ activities with non-UNFCCC programmes that<lb/> support those activities, such as the UN-REDD Programme, the REDD+ Partnership, the Forest Investment<lb/> Program (FIP) and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).<lb/> 6<lb/> The IPCC tier approach represents a hierarchy of levels of methodological complexity (IPCC, 2006).<lb/> Higher tiers imply increased accuracy in the method or parameters used in the estimation of emissions and<lb/> removals. Tier 1 refers to the use of default data whereas Tier 2 implies the use of country-specific data.<lb/> Advanced methods and detailed country-specific data are applied within the Tier 3 approach. Higher tiers<lb/> are generally considered to be more accurate but can also imply higher uncertainties. If capacity is<lb/> available, higher tier methodologies shall be especially applied for key sources due to their implication for<lb/> the absolute emission level (IPCC, 2000).</table>
