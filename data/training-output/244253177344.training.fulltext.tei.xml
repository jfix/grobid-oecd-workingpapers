			<head>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ<lb/> The significance of Switzerland&apos;s enormous current-account surplus<lb/></head>

			<p>Switzerland has had a long-standing surplus on its current account. But over the past 15 years that surplus<lb/> has surged to levels unmatched by nearly any other OECD country at any point. This paper looks at the<lb/> surplus from a balance of payments vantage point as well as from the optic of the excess of national saving<lb/> over domestic investment. It then seeks possible explanations for the uptrend and assesses whether it<lb/> results to any extent from market, institutional or policy failures that could call for reforms. A number of<lb/> important measurement issues are raised. But the key recommendation is that the authorities should<lb/> prepare for a possible sharp increase in the value of the Swiss franc if and when investors engaged in the<lb/> &quot; carry trade &quot; unwind their positions. To that end they should examine labour, capital and product markets<lb/> with a view to ensuring they are as flexible as possible and that factors are as mobile as possible, both<lb/> geographically and sectorally. This will allow any necessary adjustment to a higher exchange rate to be<lb/> smoothly accommodated. This Working Paper is largely extracted from the 2007 OECD Economic Survey<lb/> of Switzerland (www.oecd.org/eco/survey/switzerland).<lb/></p>

			<head>A traditionally sizeable external surplus has been on an uptrend since 1991 and has surged since 2002<lb/></head>

			<p>Switzerland has traditionally recorded a surplus on its current external account. Prior to the 1990s that<lb/> surplus showed no particular trend as a share of its GDP, averaging around 4%. However, beginning in<lb/> 1991 it began what has been an almost uninterrupted ascent, culminating in the extraordinary figure of<lb/> 15.1% of GDP in 2006 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). 2 Indeed, this figure is unsurpassed in the history of OECD countries<lb/> with the exception of Norway, though only in 2006 (thanks to its substantial oil revenues). But Switzerland<lb/> has no significant natural resources. Its surplus should therefore be more amenable to analysis using the<lb/> economist&apos;s normal toolkit. The question to be faced here is what has caused this development and whether<lb/> the surplus is appropriate for Switzerland, or, if not, what market or policy failures might be operating, and<lb/> what should be done to remedy the situation.<lb/> Taking the normal balance of payments components of the current account, it is obvious that, even if<lb/> goods and especially non-factor services 3 have likewise been in gently rising surplus over the past<lb/> 15 years, the main driver of the surging current-account surplus has been factor income and investment<lb/> income in particular. 4 Indeed, the CHF 57.3 billion balance on investment income in 2006 represented 80%<lb/> of the total surplus (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>); that outcome was exceeded only by those recorded by <ref type="biblio">Japan</ref> and the<lb/> 1.<lb/> The authors are, respectively, Head of Division in the Country Studies Branch of the OECD Economics<lb/> Department and Economist in the French Ministry of the Environment and formerly a consultant at the<lb/> OECD. This paper was originally produced for the OECD Economic Survey of Switzerland, published in<lb/> November 2007 under the responsibility of the Economic and Development Review Committee. The<lb/> authors are thankful to Val Koromzay, Andrew Dean, Andrés Fuentes and Claude Giorno for their helpful<lb/> comments, as well as to Françoise Correia and Mee-Lan Frank for excellent technical assistance.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Preliminary data for the first three quarters of 2007 show the surplus rose to 17.5% of GDP, even though<lb/> net investment income fell: a shrinking deficit on current transfers as well as rising surpluses on both goods<lb/> and services (no doubt related to improved competitiveness) lie behind the increase.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The 2006 surplus on non-factor services account of CHF 33.2 billion was led by net earnings of<lb/> CHF 13.1 billion on financial services, attributable to the strength of Swiss financial institutions, especially<lb/> the banks.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Labour income is in deficit because of the heavy proportion of frontier workers among the work force and<lb/> the resulting cross-border salary payments.<lb/> United Kingdom. Those receipts are first and foremost from direct investment, but with a substantial<lb/> presence of portfolio and other investment income receipts as well. Furthermore, even though of course<lb/> Switzerland&apos;s accounts follow international methodological norms, those guidelines lead to significant<lb/> distortions in its case 5 : profits earned abroad by Swiss-based multinational enterprises are attributed to<lb/> Switzerland, even if the ultimate owners of those firms are to a large extent resident abroad (think of the<lb/> many investors in, for example, Nestlé reside outside Switzerland). While it is not possible to be precise,<lb/> central bank calculations show that correction for this factor on the payments side of the ledger alone<lb/> would cut the current-account surplus by some 4¼ percentage points of GDP, leaving the true balance<lb/> in 2006 closer to 11% of GDP (SNB, 2007a, <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>). The IMF estimates that it could be as much as<lb/> 7 points of GDP (IMF, 2007). Of course these are gross figures, and the same distortion is in the data for<lb/> other countries and for Swiss portfolio holders of shares in foreign multinationals. Indeed, using figures<lb/> provided in the annual SNB report on the 2006 balance of payments, 6 the corresponding correction on the<lb/> receipts side would probably be nearly 1½ percentage points of GDP, leaving the net adjustment at less<lb/> than 3 percentage points of GDP and the adjusted current account at around 12½ per cent of GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the financial account the numerous large Swiss multinational enterprises manage to earn<lb/> significant profits, leading to outsized net outflows of direct investment; in 2006, this was offset to some<lb/> extent by inward direct investment in Switzerland. 7 Otherwise portfolio flows in both debt and equity form<lb/> go predominantly abroad; they dwarf their counterpart flows into Switzerland. This is consistent with a<lb/> portfolio diversification explanation of these capital flows: as elsewhere, home bias (unexploited<lb/> diversification potential) has been decreasing steadily but is believed not to have been entirely eliminated.<lb/> The other items on the financial account represent mainly corporate and commercial account borrowing<lb/> and lending activities. In 2006 they were primarily increases in liabilities of Swiss banks and non-financial<lb/> enterprises to foreign banks. Finally, the accumulation of reserve assets has often been another counterpart<lb/> of the current-account surplus, but in 2006 they were largely unchanged. This conforms to the pattern of<lb/> the evolution of the franc: under semi-constant upward pressure in most of the post-Bretton Woods era, its<lb/> uptrend seems to have come to an end several years ago, together with the steady rise in what has become<lb/> known as the &quot; carry trade &quot; , discussed further below. Against the euro its value was falling from early 2003<lb/> until late 2007, cumulatively by nearly 8% on an effective basis.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Another similar distortion comes through net direct investment income earned by foreign controlled<lb/> finance and holding companies: they earn income from foreign subsidiaries and pay it to foreign parents,<lb/> with what has turned out to be a small but increasing impact on Switzerland&apos;s aggregate current account</p>

			<table>–<lb/> an average of CHF 3 billion from 2000 to 2004, but nearly CHF 14 billion in 2005.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Such figures comprise the fact that the ratio of Swiss portfolio investment in foreign shares to foreign<lb/> investment in Swiss shares (CHF 747 billion) is one-third; that foreign companies have a higher dividend<lb/> payout ratio than Swiss companies (assumed here to be one-half, rather than one-third); and that the<lb/> proportion of earnings of Swiss companies that are attributable to foreign shareholders is CHF 19.5 billion.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Indeed, the net outflow of direct investment reversed toward the end of 2006, as Swiss movements of<lb/> equity capital abroad slowed more than the corresponding shrinkage in foreign flows into Switzerland.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)2<lb/> Figure 1.

			<head>In the last decade the rise in the surplus has been mainly driven by higher domestic saving<lb/></head>

			<p>The current account is also the excess of gross national saving over gross domestic investment. While<lb/> in the early 1990s both aggregates were falling in relation to GDP, the national saving rate began to rise<lb/> around the middle of the 1990s, reaching around 35% of GDP by 2000 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>)</p>

			<figure>, although this figure<lb/> might be overestimated due to the share foreigners hold in Swiss multinationals. The investment share<lb/> showed no such uptrend, with the result that the current account surged. Following a brief interruption in<lb/> 2001-02, when the saving ratio fell, the investment share too began to shrink in 2002, and the difference<lb/> between the two resumed its rise. It is as yet unknown which component lies behind the most recent jump<lb/> in the surplus, as no savings/investment data are as yet available for 2006.<lb/> Figure 2. Trend in savings, investment and net current account<lb/> As a percentage of GDP<lb/> Source: Federal Statistical Office and OECD, Annual National Accounts database.<lb/> Figure 3. Split of the saving surplus in the Swiss economy<lb/> As a percentage of total net saving<lb/> Source: Federal Statistical Office and OECD, Annual National Accounts database.<lb/></figure>

			<head>That increase in saving is largely attributable to financial corporations and, more recently, government<lb/></head>

			<p>Taking a closer look by economic agents (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), it is households that have traditionally<lb/> contributed the largest share of the excess of saving over investment, although their share has been<lb/> shrinking in recent years. This is partly because of the well developed and mature pension system:<lb/> second-pillar pension savings are around half of household financial wealth. 8 Government incurred a<lb/> saving shortfall for most of the 1990s, then ran a series of surpluses before returning to deficit in 2003-04;<lb/> while outcomes thereafter are not definitive, it seems highly likely that general government saving returned<lb/> 8.<lb/> Total pension fund assets and life insurance investments were already over 150% of GDP in 2004, the<lb/> highest ratio in the OECD. The Federal Office of Social Security sets some ceilings on the share of pension<lb/> fund assets that can be invested offshore. For the system as a whole that share is currently around one half<lb/> and rising.<lb/> to the black in 2005-06. At the same time, government investment has been dropping steadily relative to<lb/> GDP since the early 1990s, with a cumulative decline of around 1¼ percentage points of GDP (about a<lb/> third of its level in 1991). Not surprisingly, corporations&apos; outcomes have been highly correlated with the<lb/> business cycle, although mainly for the non-financial component. For their part, financial corporations<lb/> have made a larger absolute contribution to the excess than their non-financial counterparts throughout the<lb/> past decade. Indeed, in recent years they have overtaken households 9 and thereby taken the top position in<lb/> terms of responsibility for the savings surplus. 10 Most of the action lies on the saving side of the ledger:<lb/> corporations have been raising the share of their income saved since the last recession (as they have done<lb/> in most OECD countries), as manifest in surging profitability. Combined with fairly steady investment<lb/> rates, the result has been a declining share of corporate saving that is invested, especially in net terms.<lb/> Firms have preferred to distribute dividends or to strengthen their balance sheets by paying down debt. In<lb/> so doing they may have made themselves attractive targets for future foreign takeovers, particularly by<lb/> private equity firms.<lb/> Because Switzerland has run such persistent surpluses on its current account, offset by capital<lb/> outflows, it has accumulated a huge net international investment position (CHF 668.7 billion or 131.7% of<lb/> GDP at Q3 2007, the highest ratio to GDP in the OECD). 11 For that matter it has extremely large positions<lb/> on both gross assets 12 and liabilities by OECD standards, surpassed as a share of GDP only by Ireland<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). These positions generate the significant investment income flows described above. According<lb/> to the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which compiles the balance of payments and the investment position<lb/> statistics, the largest share of gross assets is held in the form of loans and other foreign assets (37%),<lb/> followed by portfolio investment (36%), direct investment (21%), derivatives and structured products (4%)<lb/> and finally reserve assets (3%). As to liabilities, nearly one half are bank and other company loans. Once<lb/> the net position is calculated, Switzerland finds itself mainly holding positions in direct investment (65%)<lb/> and portfolio investment (26%). However, the latter is an unbalanced mix comprising debt securities<lb/> (82%), partly offset by a negative position in equity securities (-57%). A breakdown by currency 13 shows<lb/> that a plurality of assets is held in US dollar form, followed fairly closely by those in euros. A majority of<lb/> liabilities is held in Swiss francs, with both dollars and euros well behind. Finally, only a limited<lb/> disaggregation by institutional sector is available, but it shows that over 15% of the net foreign assets<lb/> belong to Swiss banks, just slightly more than what is owned by the SNB. Noteworthy is the steady<lb/> increase in the government&apos;s net foreign liability position in recent years: it rose from around<lb/> CHF 10 billion at end-2001 to CHF 53 billion at end-2006, despite the improvement in the fiscal balance.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Part of the reason for weakness in household saving in recent years is the decline in mandatory saving<lb/> whose share of households&apos; gross disposable income fell from over 10% in most of the 1990s to around 7%<lb/> in 2002-04. Voluntary saving took up the slack in 2000-01, keeping the aggregate rate near 16% but has<lb/> likewise fallen back since then, leaving the total rate around 14%.<lb/> 10.<lb/> The institutional shares in 2004 were: 44% for financial corporations, 34% for households, 29% for<lb/> non-financial corporations and -7% for general government.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Such a large net asset position is nothing new for Switzerland: SNB officials believe it to have been around<lb/> 100% of GDP also before World War I.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Assets of non-residents managed by banks in Switzerland are of course not included in its net international<lb/> investment position. However, if non-Swiss high net-worth individuals move their economic centre of<lb/> interest to Switzerland (as many have done to take advantage of attractive tax regimes), then their assets<lb/> would, in principle, be considered as Swiss. Nevertheless, the SNB believes that such cases do not play a<lb/> significant role in the evolution of the net foreign asset position, even if they could contribute to its level.<lb/></p>

			<table>13.<lb/> The share of foreign-currency assets rose from 62% in 1985 to 87% in 2005 and then edged back to 82% in<lb/> 2006, while the share of liabilities in foreign currencies fell in the first decade and then rebounded to 45%<lb/> in 2005 before falling back to 42% in 2006 (SNB, 2007a and 2007b).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)2<lb/> Figure 4.

			<p>But easily the most puzzling feature of these accounts is the fact that these large and persistent<lb/> current-account surpluses have failed to lead to corresponding increases in Switzerland&apos;s net asset position<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Stoffels and Tille, 2007; SNB, 2007b</ref>). 14 This &quot; disconnect &quot; began at the turn of the millennium: since<lb/> end-1999 – and only until 2006 – cumulative net financial outflows represent 85.4% of 2006 GDP, but<lb/> SNB estimates of net foreign assets have risen by a meagre 11.6% of that GDP. The discrepancy amounts<lb/> to more than CHF 350 billion or about CHF 50 billion per year. Starting two years later, as the<lb/> SNB (2007b) does, leaves a stock-flow discrepancy averaging over CHF 60 billion per year. For example,<lb/> 14.<lb/> This was sufficiently puzzling that the SNB decided to include a special section in their annual publication<lb/> on the international investment position dealing with the divergence</p>

			<table>– see SNB (2007b, pp. 11-13).<lb/> in 2006 alone, when the financial account recorded an outflow of CHF 91 billion and the current account a<lb/> surplus of CHF 72 billion the SNB shows that the net investment position rose by only CHF 3 billion.<lb/> A number of possible explanations come to mind:<lb/>  Valuation changes. Changing exchange rates clearly prevent the change in the stocks from<lb/> equalling the flows. Since most assets are in foreign currency and most liabilities in francs, it is<lb/> clear that if the franc appreciates the value of Swiss holdings will suffer the consequences. From<lb/> 1999 to 2006 an increase of the exchange rate was indeed observed. According to the<lb/> SNB (2007b), such exchange-rate losses have been worth an average of CHF 28 billion since<lb/> 2002. Secondly, and this may be the major explanation for the outcomes in 2005 and 2006, there<lb/> are valuation gains and losses on foreign holdings of equity in Switzerland and on Swiss holdings<lb/> of equity abroad. In a longer-term perspective, according to Stoffels and Tille (2007), such<lb/> valuation effects can explain only a part (around 30%) of the discrepancy on the net position<lb/> (with 23% and 7% attributable to exchange rates and asset prices fluctuations, respectively). With<lb/> direct investment at estimated market values (and not at book values as in international<lb/> investment position statistics), their calculations show that valuation effects are somewhat more<lb/> successful, accounting for almost exactly half of the total to be explained. For its part, the<lb/> SNB (2007b) attributes more than CHF 20 billion per year to such capital losses (about one-third<lb/> of the total).<lb/>  Measurement problems. One obvious distortion is that official Swiss data are calculated using<lb/> only book-value estimates for foreign direct investment. However, Stoffels and Tille (2007)<lb/> attempt an approximation to a market-value adjustment and find that the correction would go the<lb/> wrong way: the net position would actually worsen by 33.8% of 2005 GDP, rather than the small<lb/> improvement in the official data. 15 Other methodological questions arise from the SNB&apos;s periodic<lb/> improvements to their procedures. For example, the survey used to estimate direct investment<lb/> positions was broadened in 2004, resulting in a CHF 11.3 billion reduction in net foreign assets<lb/> (some 2.5 % of 2005 GDP), without any corresponding change in the financial flows (Stoffels<lb/> and Tille<ref type="biblio">, 2007</ref>, footnote 24). 16 Overall, SNB (2007b) argued that once valuation changes are<lb/> properly accounted for, only CHF 12 billion per year of non-identified changes remain (less than<lb/> a quarter of the total). Similarly, the flow data might have missed certain items, such as the<lb/> repayment of principal on foreign bonds at maturity. This would be consistent with the sizeable<lb/> positive errors and omissions in the balance of payments (an excess of net financial outflows over<lb/> the current-account surplus, abstracting from capital transfers).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Taking the valuation effects year by year it appears that exchange-rate changes played a fairly<lb/> important role in 2001-04 and 2006, but franc depreciation in 2005 goes in the wrong direction. Broad<lb/> indexes of asset prices point to underperformance for Swiss investors abroad relative to foreigners in<lb/> 15.<lb/> The Stoffels and Tille approach was to adjust assets and liabilities for valuation changes using broad share<lb/> price indexes. For direct investment holdings by foreign investors the Swiss share price index was<lb/> appropriately used. However, they used share price indexes of relevant destination countries for Swiss<lb/> direct investments abroad, this during a period (1999-2005) when the latter fell while the former rose. It is<lb/> debatable whether such indexes would have been an unbiased depiction of the underlying value of those<lb/> holdings. It might even be argued that Swiss share prices might have been a better indicator of such price<lb/> movements.<lb/> 16.<lb/> Since 1999, several other significant statistical revisions affecting Switzerland&apos;s international investment<lb/> position have taken place. Also, sometimes funds are moved in and out of the country without<lb/> corresponding financial flows; this too could help explain some of the discrepancy.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Switzerland mainly in 2000, 2005 and 2006. Notice, however, that prior to 1998 the financial flows on<lb/> some holdings were essentially computed as the change in positions (<ref type="biblio">Stoffels and Tille, 2007</ref>).<lb/> The next question to be considered arising from this disconnect is what are the implications for the<lb/> returns that the nation is earning. These returns comprise the straightforward yields, as measured in the<lb/> investment income accounts, plus the valuation changes. Stoffels and <ref type="biblio">Tille (2007)</ref> show that, taking the<lb/> six years 2000 to 2005, yields alone were higher on Swiss assets than on its liabilities by more than a full<lb/> percentage point, 17 much as it has been for the United States (<ref type="biblio">Jarrett, 2005</ref>). However, once just measured<lb/> valuation gains and losses are brought into the picture, their estimate of the gap becomes -0.8 percentage<lb/> point. Hence, if these figures are to be believed, Swiss investors who placed money abroad for portfolio<lb/> diversification and rate-of-return considerations fared much worse than foreign investors who bet on the<lb/> Swiss market, even though the latter heavily reflects returns in the already mature and capital-intensive<lb/> Swiss economy<lb/></p>

			<head>What could be causing this huge surplus?<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the current-account surplus is such a long-standing feature of the Swiss external accounts,<lb/> whatever is causing it cannot be entirely a recent phenomenon. But until the last 15 years or so it averaged<lb/> less than 4% of GDP, a figure that is frequently seen in many other OECD countries. It is truly the upsurge<lb/> since the early 1990s that is unusual and demanding of interpretation. As seen above, the nation&apos;s saving<lb/> rate increased from 1992 to 2000, then plunged before rebounding. But it is – at some 36% of GDP in<lb/> 2005 – amongst the highest in the OECD (along with Norway and Korea), some three times as high as<lb/> those near the bottom of the scale (though the official Swiss figure is probably biased up by the<lb/> aforementioned measurement error). To what might this be attributed? Unlike Norway, whose current<lb/> income level is undoubtedly in excess of long-term levels thanks to its oil revenues, it would not normally<lb/> make sense to seek a &quot; permanent income &quot; view of the surplus. Theoretically, differential demographics<lb/> could help to explain some of the gap, but the evidence is fairly clear that the speed of future ageing<lb/> pressures is no more rapid in Switzerland than elsewhere in the OECD, arguably less so (OECD, 2006a).<lb/></p>

			<p>There are some more promising lines of reasoning, however. First, it is well known that Switzerland<lb/> has a well developed system of mandatory second-pillar retirement saving. Such saving represents half of<lb/> overall household saving and about 15% of gross national saving, though its share was much greater in the<lb/> 1990s. These pension funds (along with life insurance investments) held assets worth more than 150% of<lb/> GDP already in 2004, the highest GDP share in the OECD. Around 44% of those assets were held abroad<lb/> at that point, the majority of which in foreign currencies. There is no need as yet to disburse the earnings<lb/> on these holdings, and it would be difficult to find attractive investment opportunities for them on domestic<lb/> markets. Second, there is a multiplicative component to the first, as the corresponding tax burden is shifted<lb/> forward in time: the typical regime in Switzerland for taxing retirement saving is EET (i.e. contributions,<lb/> accrued returns and ultimate pension payments are exempt, exempt and taxable, respectively), which is<lb/> generous but not unusual (and this generosity might not have much effect on national saving,<lb/> 17.<lb/> For the most recent five years SNB figures show that Swiss investors earned average annual returns of 4%<lb/> on their foreign assets, but only 2.5% once direct investment (9.9%) is excluded.<lb/></p>

			<p>since the tax advantage might merely shift the saving from the public to the private sector 18 ). But even an<lb/> unremarkable regime may be unusual when combined with a large mandatory component. Furthermore,<lb/> pension savings are not subject to estate duties (OECD, 1999, Box 1). And because there is no capital gains<lb/> tax on portfolio investment by households and pension funds, 19 saving is treated more generously than in<lb/> countries having such a tax. Third, since most foreign assets are denominated in foreign currencies, whose<lb/> emitters have traditionally had higher interest rates than Switzerland (in order to compensate investors for<lb/> their higher average inflation rates), and, conversely, most liabilities are in Swiss francs, part of the net<lb/> inflow of interest income (and the higher national saving that is its counterpart) is merely what amounts to<lb/> a return of capital to Swiss lenders. According to unpublished central-bank estimates, this could be as<lb/> much as CHF 20 billion per year (4.4% of GDP, around one quarter of the total current-account surplus).<lb/> On the other hand, however, when the saving does not involve foreign assets, it is to expected real<lb/> domestic interest rates and returns that saving responds. While ex ante rates are difficult to observe, ex post<lb/> real rates in Switzerland have traditionally been low by OECD standards, but that gap, at least for<lb/> long-term government bonds, fell sharply about a decade ago, and local rates are now virtually<lb/> indistinguishable from the OECD average when measured – even if crudely – using only a single period&apos;s<lb/> inflation rate (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). 20 Hence, perhaps there has been some increase in relative incentives to save,<lb/> 18.<lb/> The force of this argument may be less in the Swiss case, since its strong budget-balance rules have<lb/> arguably restrained any resulting public dis-saving.<lb/> 19.<lb/> Capital gains by households are hardly ever taxable when money is put into shares of companies listed on<lb/> the stock exchange, as these companies may be considered as ever lasting. The situation becomes much<lb/> more complicated in all other circumstances. In any case, all cantons have capital gains taxes on real estate.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a growing literature that has looked at the question of international equalisation of real rates of<lb/> return on financial assets. It shows that such returns are indeed equalised for equities but not for<lb/> fixed-income instruments nor deposits: those denominated in Swiss francs have earned significantly lower<lb/> returns, even in the long run (<ref type="biblio">Kugler and Weder, 2003</ref>). This violation of real interest-rate parity is found<lb/> to be due to a failure of uncovered interest rate parity even in the long run, rather than to deviations from<lb/> purchasing power parity: the Swiss franc does not appreciate enough to offset the short-term interest rate<lb/> differential. This is unique among major currencies (<ref type="biblio">Kugler and Weder, 2005</ref>), even if other creditor<lb/> countries also experience some degree of home bias. Global investors seem willing to pay a premium for<lb/> possibly three reasons: first, because there has been less price-level uncertainty for Swiss assets, because<lb/> the monetary authorities have kept inflation so low; second, because Swiss franc assets seem to provide<lb/> unique diversification benefits (<ref type="biblio">Kugler and Weder, 2004</ref>); and, third, so as to avoid the effects of very rare<lb/> resulting from a reduced willingness of foreigners to hold Swiss assets at lower expected real rates of<lb/> return. Finally, saving can include a precautionary motive, in which case it should respond positively to<lb/> income volatility. An admittedly imperfect proxy for that would be the volatility of real GDP growth.<lb/> Using the standard deviation of real growth (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>), it can be seen that Switzerland&apos;s economy is less<lb/> volatile than the average but that its advantage has been diminishing steadily and has effectively<lb/> disappeared during the past year or two. Even that measure is not uniquely identified, however, as the<lb/> standard deviation suffers from a scaling problem: using the coefficient of variation instead, Switzerland&apos;s<lb/> volatility has in fact been mostly greater than in the average OECD country.<lb/> In a longer-term perspective, the modest level of Switzerland&apos;s investment rate also looks worthy of<lb/> interest: the investment share of GDP fell sharply during the early-1990s recession (by about 8 percentage<lb/> points of GDP), remained fairly steady during the subsequent upswing and then declined again in the most<lb/> recent downturn, reaching a level little more than 20% of GDP. The average OECD country followed a<lb/> similar pattern, but its declines were far more modest and the rebounds sharper. Thus, Switzerland shifted<lb/> from being a higher-than-average investor to a sub-par investor initially in 1999 and then more<lb/> emphatically from 2003. By 2004-05 its shortfall from the simple average of OECD countries was more<lb/> than a full percentage point of GDP, a switch of 6 percentage points since 1990.<lb/></p>

			<p>catastrophic events (such as a war) that they perceive would have an asymmetric impact on Swiss assets<lb/> because of the nation&apos;s long-standing neutrality. Concretely, if such a shock were to transpire, the Swiss<lb/> franc would be expected to appreciate, perhaps sharply. Another explanation – that the premium is<lb/> attributable to Swiss banking secrecy – is less convincing, since the return anomaly is also present in Swiss<lb/> franc Euro-deposits, which are beyond the reach of Swiss law. Finally, if the explanation were to lie with<lb/> real structural factors such as higher capital intensity with decreasing marginal returns or productivity<lb/> differences between the tradeables and non-tradeables sectors (Balassa-Samuelson-type effects), it would<lb/> be purchasing power parity that would fail to hold, since the real exchange-rate appreciation would be<lb/> sufficient to explain the failure of uncovered interest parity. In any case, what has not yet been researched<lb/> is to what extent the lower-returns phenomenon still holds: the data used by the cited authors to establish it<lb/> covered the period 1980 to 2003, but the &quot; carry trade &quot; really got underway only at the very end of the<lb/> sample period; the franc was falling from 2003 to 2007; and there was a steady shorting of the franc in<lb/> futures markets as from 2005 (see footnote 26 below). The time since the last major global disruption<lb/> continues to lengthen, and investors surely attribute an ever-declining probability of any recurrence.<lb/></p>

			<p>In many quarters in Switzerland it is believed that the low investment rate is explained by the<lb/> country&apos;s maturity and income level: it is argued that the prospective returns on capital are likely to be<lb/> lower in Switzerland than in many other parts of the world because the existing capital stock is already<lb/> high in relation to output levels. However, the evidence linking investment rates and income levels is<lb/> moderate, though Switzerland does not appear to be an outlier. 21 Also, while official statistical agencies<lb/> make different methodological assumptions to generate aggregate national capital stock series, 22 and hence<lb/> substantial caution in making international comparisons is called for, it can be seen that indeed capital<lb/> intensity seems rather high in Switzerland. 23 The question that remains is why a mature economy cannot<lb/> exploit its central location and well educated labour force, along with well developed financial markets to<lb/> sustain fairly high rates of investment. Low investment at home may be attributable more to a lack of<lb/> effective competition (in economists&apos; terms: &quot; the quiet life &quot; for incumbents, who try to reduce supply so as<lb/> to raise prices) – which may or may not be linked to weak or even negative capital productivity growth –<lb/> and poor prospects for new entrants in existing industries (network industries in particular), as well as in<lb/> innovative sunrise sectors (<ref type="biblio">Alesina et al., 2003; OECD, 2006b</ref>). However, it may also be explained in part<lb/> by: i) a reduction in risk premia abroad, owing primarily to successful disinflation, that has led to some<lb/> diversion of global capital flows away from Switzerland; and ii) the high price level, which encourages<lb/> servicing the Swiss market by exports from abroad rather than inward direct investment, thus limiting<lb/> gross fixed capital formation.<lb/> Another approach in trying to explain the enormity of the surplus is to look at its components and of<lb/> absorption in particular. As seen above, the growing size of Switzerland&apos;s current-account surplus is only<lb/> to a small extent attributable to its goods and non-factor services accounts, on which surpluses have grown<lb/> due to slower Swiss GDP growth than in major trading partners as well as a trend improvement in Swiss<lb/> competitiveness. Export performance was very strong until 1985, but thereafter it weakened steadily. In<lb/> effect the gains in competitiveness due to the steadily lower rate of inflation were offset by increases in the<lb/> Swiss franc&apos;s exchange rate. The franc appreciated at an average rate of some 4% per year from 1970<lb/> to 2003, but most of that was offset by the favourable CPI inflation differential, leaving an average annual<lb/> real rise of some 1¼ per cent. However, beginning around 2002-03 the trend appreciation came to an end,<lb/> and the deterioration in export performance did likewise a year or two later. 24 Following the franc&apos;s peak in<lb/> early 2003 it fell cumulatively by around 8% in nominal effective terms and by 12% in real (CPI) effective<lb/> terms until its trough in late 2007; since then it has recovered a good bit of that fall. The result is that there<lb/> were then claims that the franc was somewhat undervalued: the IMF (2007), for example, stated that it may<lb/> have been up to 20% undervalued, even if its equilibrium may have fallen because it may no longer be<lb/> seen to the same extent as a safe-haven currency and it clearly is little used any more as an official reserve<lb/> currency. 25<lb/> 21.<lb/> Regressing the investment/GDP ratio in current prices on per capita GDP in purchasing-power parities<lb/> across the 30 OECD Member countries for the average values from 2000 to 2005 in either linear or<lb/> log-linear form results in a marginally significant negative coefficient on per capita output with a t-ratio of<lb/> close to 2 and a very small positive residual for Switzerland. Reverse causality may bias the coefficient<lb/> estimate towards zero.<lb/> 22.<lb/> It would be even more dubious to try to compare ex ante rates of return to capital across countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>23.<lb/> An additional reason for caution here, however, is that the OECD has shifted away from the use of capital<lb/> stock series in its modelling exercises in favour of a capital-services approach (<ref type="biblio">Beffy et al., 2006</ref>). But no<lb/> such data existed for Switzerland until very recently.<lb/> 24.<lb/> In fact, preliminary data for recent quarters show a steady improvement in export performance and in the<lb/> trade balance: in 2007 it reached CHF 13.9 billion, 76% higher than the 2005 outcome.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Recent work at the BIS (<ref type="biblio">Cairns et al., 2007)</ref> shows that the franc remains the currency of choice (along<lb/> with the euro) when volatility increases. Nevertheless, BIS figures show the franc&apos;s share of global reserve<lb/> holdings had already fallen to negligible levels by the mid-1990s (<ref type="biblio">Wooldridge, 2006</ref>).<lb/> The &quot; carry trade &quot; is the label given to the transactions that involve (often leveraged) borrowing of<lb/> low-yielding currencies like the franc and more particularly the yen in favour of assets denominated in<lb/> high-return currencies such as the New Zealand dollar but also those from emerging markets. Of course,<lb/> normally low-yielding currencies are expected to appreciate, else nobody would willingly hold them, but in<lb/> recent years various classes of investors have been willing to take on the currency risk and undertake such<lb/> trading without hedging. 26 Indeed, the common element between trading in the yen and the franc can be<lb/> demonstrated by looking at daily exchange-rate changes for the two monies: for the past five and a half<lb/> years these have become significantly positively correlated, whereas previously there had been no such<lb/> relationship (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). The result of the increase in carry trading is that the stock of outstanding bank<lb/> lending in francs to foreign non-bank private borrowers is estimated to have reached some $138 billion at<lb/> end-September 2006, up from a steady $35 to $40 billion during the decade ending in 1998. Of course risk<lb/> appetites do change, but even though most analysts have been predicting a return to form for the franc for<lb/> quite some time – in part because the SNB has been busily putting up its official rates – the temptation to<lb/> maintain the heretofore profitable strategy was sufficient to sustain it until late in 2007. And franc<lb/> weakness began to worry SNB senior officials who took note of its direct impact on Switzerland&apos;s import<lb/> prices and its indirect effect on tradeables prices more generally (<ref type="biblio">McCormick, 2007</ref>). But with the<lb/> intensifying global financial turmoil of recent months, many investors seem to have unwound their bets<lb/> against the franc, and it has rebounded against the euro and surged against the dollar.<lb/> While in the yen&apos;s case, the purchased assets are to be found around the world, it seems that most of<lb/> the franc borrowing has ended up in mortgage and other private lending in Central and Eastern Europe,<lb/> especially in Austria, 27 Hungary, Croatia and Poland. Most of this has been undertaken by Austrian banks;<lb/> Swiss banks are believed to have limited direct exposure. But apparently franc-denominated lending has<lb/> even become popular in Denmark, with outstanding loans reaching DKR 20 billion (nearly 3 billion euros)<lb/> in 2006 (<ref type="biblio">Bernstein, 2007</ref>). In any case, it could be argued that transactions involving borrowing by<lb/> residents of a high interest-rate country in a low-yielding currency like the franc to purchase domestic<lb/> assets are qualitatively different from leveraged activities by financial players typically involving<lb/> derivative contracts, if only because the investments are not likely to be unwound quickly (<ref type="biblio">BIS, 2007</ref>).<lb/> 26.<lb/> Indeed, some investors go so far as to short low-yielding currencies to speculate that the carry trade will<lb/> dominate longer-run fundamentals. Swiss franc futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile<lb/> Exchange (CME) were showing a substantial net non-commercial short position outstanding in 2005-07.<lb/> Indeed, the magnitude of that net position reached a record level of nearly 80 000 contracts on<lb/> 19 June 2007, which, at a value of CHF 125 000 per contract, implied a bet of nearly CHF 10 billion<lb/> against the franc. Higher CME short positions have tended to presage downward movements in the<lb/> currency against the dollar.<lb/> 27.<lb/> Tzanninis (2005) points out that loans to Austrian households in foreign currencies have surged since the<lb/> mid-1990s, reaching nearly 30 billion euros (30% of outstanding loans) by early 2005. Nearly all of these<lb/> loans are in Swiss francs. Franc-denominated loans to all non-banks totalled more than 40 billion euros<lb/> already at that point.<lb/></table>

			<head>The implications for public policy<lb/></head>

			<p>To sum up to this point: Switzerland has an unusually large current-account surplus which, even<lb/> though it implies a possible disequilibrium, is clearly not something that elicits sustainability concerns,<lb/> since there is no limit to a nation&apos;s acquisition of net foreign assets. If there are indeed fundamental drivers<lb/> such as differences in rates of time preference between Swiss and foreigners, then policy-makers should<lb/> look no further. However, even though no evidence is available on this question, it would be unwise to rely<lb/> entirely on the existence of such differences. It is more likely that it is long-standing differences in Swiss<lb/> policy-settings and institutions that have created the favourable conditions for saving, if not the reluctance<lb/> in recent years to engage in investment. So long as these settings are deemed appropriate once carefully<lb/> examined, then there is no separate reason to change policy or to take specific measures to bring the<lb/> current surplus down. If it declines because policy improvements generate faster trend growth, which<lb/> stimulates both investment and imports, then that is all well and good. Yet it must be recognised that the<lb/> potential to achieve lasting changes in external balances through structural reforms is probably fairly<lb/> limited (<ref type="biblio">Kennedy and Sløk, 2005</ref>).<lb/> One angle that justifies explicit thinking about the surplus is its role in determining the real exchange<lb/> rate. A higher surplus would normally lead to a stronger currency to ensure long-run balance of payments<lb/> equilibrium. But the carry trade has driven down the value of the franc, possibly to an unsustainable<lb/> level. 28 If at some point Swiss holders of its huge foreign assets decide to repatriate them at a rapid pace or<lb/> foreign investors choose quite suddenly to unwind their carry-trade positions – possibly because of a drop<lb/> in risk appetite and increase in volatility 29 or because the SNB moves more aggressively to raise interest<lb/> rates – then the franc exchange rate would appreciate and could even spike higher, as happened to the yen<lb/> and the franc in the second half of 1998 and has been hinted at in recent months. This might call for quick<lb/> 28.<lb/> There has also probably been a reverse mechanism at work: by causing a depreciation, the carry trade has<lb/> no doubt led to an increase in the size of the surplus itself, through a rise in net exports of goods and<lb/> services associated with improved competitiveness and through higher net factor income.<lb/> 29.<lb/> For a useful, detailed look at the current state of the carry trade see Nordvig (2007). He argues that reduced<lb/> global risk appetite could pose a challenge to carry-trading strategies, especially as the compensation for<lb/> currency risk looks to have diminished to very unattractive levels for investments in G10 currencies,<lb/> though not for those of emerging markets.<lb/> action on the part of the monetary authorities to stabilise the economy, since such a shock would have<lb/> important deflationary consequences. But the implications for some sectors could be serious, even if<lb/> contractionary aggregate consequences were avoided. Blanchard (2007) has recently argued in a different<lb/> context that, after several years of depressed output, producers of non-tradeables might have permanently<lb/> lower productivity through hysteresis effects and might also lack the wherewithal (financial and other) to<lb/> expand in response to the price signals. That might be taken as a justification for some redirected<lb/> budgetary spending to non-tradeables sectors and to investment in particular.<lb/></p>

			<p>Assuming the new, higher level of the franc was fairly rapidly seen as quasi-permanent, then the<lb/> resulting drop in the demand for exports and import-competing goods and services would lead to pressures<lb/> for restructuring. It is therefore crucial – so as to be as well prepared for such an outcome as possible – that<lb/> Swiss markets be flexible and that factors be mobile both geographically and sectorally. Fortunately,<lb/> available evidence points to a very high degree of economic resilience due to well developed and flexible<lb/> financial markets and a moderate degree of labour-and product-market regulation (<ref type="biblio">Duval et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/> Specific policy implications are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p> In terms of labour markets, that implies: first, that employee protection rules and legislation be<lb/> designed – as is the case – with a view to assisting individuals and not protecting jobs; second,<lb/> that stamp duties on housing transactions not act as a barrier to the sale of a home that is<lb/> necessitated by a shift in the owner&apos;s employment; third, that cantonal occupational licensing<lb/> requirements be suppressed in favour of a mutual recognition/single passport approach; fourth,<lb/> that immigration be recognised as especially valuable, since immigrants are more mobile within<lb/> the country and admission is sensitive to the need for specific skills; and, finally, that added focus<lb/> be placed on training and general (as opposed to firm-specific) skills in this context of shifting<lb/> economic needs.<lb/>  As to capital markets, policies should focus on encouraging financial-market participants to boost<lb/> their funding of start-ups and other youthful firms, since it is through such entities that<lb/> inter-sectoral shifts proceed the most smoothly. Similarly, bankruptcy customs and law should not<lb/> be designed so as to hold resources in sectors exposed to negative long-term structural shifts. 30 In<lb/> addition, tax and corporate governance rules should likewise not discourage exit or redeployment:<lb/> in that regard the classical treatment of dividends in the tax law probably acts to hold resources<lb/> within firms and thus, at the margin, within existing industries. Bringing in a ceiling on the tax<lb/> deductibility of second-pillar saving (to the lowest statutory rate) might help to treat saving in<lb/> low-risk assets in a less favourable fashion. But the temptation to use tax policy to directly<lb/> stimulate investment should be resisted, especially if the support were aimed squarely at housing,<lb/> where many OECD countries are overly generous.<lb/>  In product markets it is crucial for firms to be able to enter new markets, and hence the<lb/> competition authorities must be vigilant to the creation or maintenance of artificial barriers to entry<lb/> by incumbents, which can significantly restrict investment (<ref type="biblio">Alesina et al., 2003</ref>). In regulated<lb/> sectors, especially network industries, sectoral regulators must also keep a watchful eye. Policies<lb/> that hold output in a given sector, such as inheritance rules applied to farmers or the<lb/> aforementioned double taxation of dividends, are especially harmful.<lb/> 30.<lb/> The authorities hope to reform the bankruptcy law during the next legislature.</p>
