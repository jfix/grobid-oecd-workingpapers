            <head>Findings </head>
 
            <figDesc>from this analysis indicate that TNCs have become an important and fast-growing part of the city&apos;s<lb/> transportation system. In 2015 and 2016, they have been the leading source of growth in non-auto (i.e.<lb/> non-personal car) travel in the city. They have also added significantly to vehicular travel and mileage on city<lb/> streets. Key findings of the report are:<lb/> <lb/> TNCs transported 15 million passengers per month in Fall 2016 -nearly as many trips as served by the<lb/> city&apos;s yellow cab industry -in 43 000 licensed vehicles.<lb/> <lb/> TNC ridership tripled between June 2015 (the end of the period examined by the City of New York&apos;s<lb/> For-Hire Vehicle Transportation Study) and the fall of 2016.<lb/> <lb/> After accounting for declines in yellow cab, black car and car service ridership, TNCs have generated net<lb/> increases of 31 million trips and 52 million passengers since 2013.<lb/> <lb/> In 2015 and to an even greater extent in 2016, growth in taxi and for-hire ridership outpaced growth in<lb/> transit (subway and bus) ridership and is now the leading source of growth in non-auto travel in New<lb/> York City. This marks a reversal from the transit-oriented growth that lasted from 1990 to 2014.<lb/> <lb/> TNCs accounted for the addition of 600 million miles of vehicular travel to the city&apos;s roadway network<lb/> over the past three years, after accounting for declines in yellow cab mileage and mileage in personal<lb/> vehicles. The additional 600 million miles exceeds the total mileage driven by yellow cabs in Manhattan.<lb/> <lb/> Total mileage of TNCs, yellow cabs, black cars and car services combined increased from 14% to 19% of<lb/> total citywide mileage from 2013 to 2016. (The industry mileage includes transportation of passengers,<lb/> &quot;dead-head&quot; miles between dropping off one passenger and picking up the next passenger, and drivers&apos;<lb/> personal use of driver-owned vehicles.)</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Altamonte Springs, Florida<lb/> In March of 2016, the City of Altamonte Springs, Florida – a low-density city near Orlando -started a pilot<lb/> programme to subsidise 20% of the cost of every trip beginning and ending within city limits. In addition,<lb/> the city subsidises 25% of the cost of all Uber trips starting or ending at the Altamonte Springs SunRail<lb/> station. In July, 2016, the pilot was expanded to four neighbouring communities.<lb/> Centennial, Colorado<lb/> From August 2016 to February 2017, the City of Centennial ran a six-month pilot programme offering free<lb/> rides to and from the Dry Creek Light Rail Station within a geofenced area. The Go Centennial pilot<lb/> temporarily replaced the Dry Creek Call-n-Ride service with a shared Lyft Line or Via Mobility Service (a<lb/> paratransit service provider) rides. In addition to those ride-service companies, the Go Centennial<lb/> partnership also included the City of Centennial, CH2M, the Denver South Transportation Management<lb/> Association (DSTMA)/Southeast Public Improvement Metropolitan District (SPIMD), and Xerox (Conduent).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Using an in-app promotion code, riders benefit from reduced-price Lyft fares. Depending on distance, riders<lb/> picked up or dropped off at stops along the old bus route from 6:00 to 20:00 pay USD 2-5 for rides that<lb/> otherwise would have cost USD 5-14 using Lyft&apos;s regular pricing. The City of San Clemente subsidises the<lb/> difference until the approximately USD 100 000 budget allocated for this pilot is exhausted. Additional<lb/> sources of revenue for the programme are being explored by both Lyft and OCTA to extend the pilot&apos;s<lb/> duration. The programme requires using the Lyft app on a smartphone but since not all Orange County<lb/> residents own a smartphone or have an adequate data plan, City officials will help qualifying residents<lb/> purchase government subsidised smartphones. In order to monitor the impact of the pilot, Lyft provides<lb/> monthly ride statistics to OCTA.<lb/> Town of Innisfil, Ontario, Canada<lb/> The town of Innisfil has entered into a partnership with Uber to provide its 36 000 residents guaranteed<lb/> rates and rides through the Uber app. As part of this partnership, the town will provide CAD 100 000 in<lb/> 2017 and CAD 125 000 in 2018. Residents will pay base fees for trips to key locations in Innisfil, and the<lb/> town will pay Uber the balance. For example, Innisfil residents will pay CAD 3 per person for any trip to or<lb/> from the Innisfil Recreational Complex and Town Hall area, and the town will cover the remainder of the<lb/> fare, from CAD 6-9. Residents will also be able to book a trip from Innisfil to anywhere they wish and<lb/> receive CAD 5 off their fare.<lb/> City of Summit, New Jersey<lb/> The City of Summit Commuter Ridesharing Pilot Program, a six-month pilot started in October 2016, covers<lb/> the full cost of Uber rides to or from the Summit light rail station (in fact, to and from a specified pick-up<lb/> and drop-off zone adjacent to the rail station) for Summit residents who have paid their monthly parking<lb/> pass at the rail station. This is because the programme aims to reduce the number of commuter cars left in<lb/> parking lots during workdays. The pilot is limited to 100 participants who are either parking pass<lb/> subscribers or non-parking pass subscribers. Parking pass subscribers receive free trips to and from the<lb/> station and non-parking pass subscribers will be charged a flat USD 2 rate per ride. Because the focus is on<lb/> work commute trips, rides are limited to two per workday per person and from only 5:00 to 21:00.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>evidence-based analysis of the interaction effects between ride services and public transport, and<lb/> the overall impact on mobility outcomes can also help guide policy-making in this area. This will require<lb/> perhaps more information from rides services than they have typically provided in the past (we discuss data<lb/> and performance indicator frameworks later) but can lead to better framed policy discussions.<lb/> 38 – FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT </figDesc>

            <figDesc>Uber pick-ups and drop-offs (blue) within a quarter mile of suburban rail services (black) in<lb/> Portland, Oregon<lb/> Source: Uber (2017).<lb/> The investigation of employee shuttle services between San Francisco and Silicon Valley is one example of<lb/> this type of evidence-based investigation of the impacts of innovative mobility services. Prior to 2014, a<lb/> number of bus and mini-bus based employee shuttles proliferated throughout the city bringing workers in<lb/> the tech industry from their residences in San Francisco to their places of employment in Silicon Valley.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Starting in January 2014, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) initiated a pilot<lb/> program that streamlined and enforced rules and monitored performance in co-operation with shuttle<lb/> operators. The programme found that while 29% of the shuttle riders would otherwise have used public<lb/> transport to get to work, nearly half (47%) would have driven alone to work along an already very<lb/> congested route. While the employee shuttle fleet did draw some riders away from public transport, it drew<lb/> many more people out of cars and thus had a positive impact on peak hour traffic. This analysis led SFMTA<lb/> to recommend that the shuttles be allowed to operate albeit under tighter regulatory control to ensure as<lb/> little impact as possible on public bus services in San Francisco (SFMTA, 2015). Such an open-ended,<lb/> flexible and evidence-based trialling of new rules could also be a model for authorities seeking synergies<lb/> between ride services and public transport.<lb/> FRAMING THE CONVERGENCE OF RIDE SERVICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT – 39</figDesc>

            <figDesc>There is a need for structured and standardised data to be communicated across the range of MaaS<lb/> actors regarding travel route accessibility and vehicular accessibility and capacity. This data should be an<lb/> integral part of the data package provided by transport operators to MaaS operators and eventually to<lb/> customers. This data is required by law to be available in machine readable format through open<lb/> interfaces by 1 January 2018. These essential accessibility data elements via open interfaces are required<lb/> by the Finnish Transport Code (TC) coming into force in 2018 and covers all transport modes and<lb/> services. However each transport mode have their mode specific data attributes, so additional work is<lb/> underway to define &quot; agreed minimums &quot; for the most critical data.<lb/> <lb/> Data regarding passengers special needs should be delivered in standardised form from MaaS operators<lb/> to the producers of transport services. The MyData model (https://mydatafi.wordpress.com/) that<lb/> emphasises the users right to limit or share the use of their personal data, could allow even more detailed<lb/> health and personal data to be communicated via application programming interfaces. Model interfaces<lb/> are being developed under a implementation project for the Finnish TC.</figDesc>
