			<figure>PISA<lb/> How are school systems adapting to<lb/> increasing numbers of immigrant students?<lb/> • On average among OECD countries, the percentage of students with an immigrant<lb/> background grew by two percentage points between 2000 and 2009.<lb/> • Immigrant students represent more than 5% of the student population in 13 OECD and<lb/> partner countries and economies that participated in PISA 2009.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• In most countries, immigrant students lag behind native students in performance; in many<lb/> countries, the difference is considerable. However, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany,<lb/> New Zealand and Switzerland have been able to narrow, and in some cases close, this<lb/> performance gap.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whether in flight from conflict, with the hope of building a better life, or to<lb/> seize a social or economic opportunity, people have been crossing borders for<lb/> as long as there have been borders to cross. Modern means of transportation<lb/> and communication, the globalisation of the labour market, and the ageing of<lb/> populations in OECD countries will drive migration well into the next decades.<lb/> The key to maintaining social cohesion during these population movements<lb/> is to integrate immigrants and their families well into their adopted countries;<lb/> and education can be a powerful lever to achieve this.<lb/></p>

			<p>Why do these numbers matter for education policy?<lb/> Because PisA results in 2000 and 2009 show that<lb/> although native students tend to outperform their<lb/> immigrant peers by an average of more than 40 score<lb/> points, some countries have been able to narrow<lb/> that gap considerably. For example, in Belgium<lb/> and switzerland, the performance gap narrowed<lb/> by nearly 40 score points during that period, even<lb/> though native students still outperform students with<lb/> an immigrant background by 68 score points in<lb/> Belgium and by 48 score points in switzerland.<lb/> And switzerland has been able to reduce the<lb/> performance gap despite the fact that the percentage<lb/> of students with an immigrant background rose<lb/> during the period. Germany, new Zealand and the<lb/> partner country Liechtenstein also show a narrowing<lb/> of the performance gap between these two groups<lb/> of students.<lb/></p>

			<p>…but in some countries, the performance gap<lb/> is shrinking.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on information gathered from questionnaires<lb/> distributed with the PisA 2009 assessment,<lb/> the percentage of 15-year-old students with an<lb/> immigrant background grew by two percentage<lb/> points, on average, between 2000 and 2009<lb/> among OECD countries with comparable data.<lb/> immigrant students now constitute more than<lb/> 5% of the 15-year-old student populations in<lb/> 13 OECD and partner countries and economies.<lb/> in ireland, new Zealand, spain, the united states,<lb/> and the partner countries Liechtenstein and the<lb/> Russian Federation, the percentage of students<lb/> with an immigrant background increased by five<lb/> percentage points or more over the past decade,<lb/> and these students now represent from 8% to 30%<lb/> of these countries&apos; student populations. in italy,<lb/> Greece and Canada, the percentage of students<lb/> with an immigrant background increased by three<lb/> to five percentage points over the same period.<lb/> nearly 25% of Canada&apos;s student population has<lb/> an immigrant background.<lb/></p>

			<p>some school systems are successful at minimising<lb/> performance differences across students, regardless<lb/> of their immigrant backgrounds. For example, in<lb/> Australia, students with an immigrant background<lb/> perform better than native students. in Canada,<lb/> immigrant students performed as well as native<lb/> students in 2009, and they represent a large – and<lb/> growing – proportion of the student population.<lb/> Socio-economic background explains<lb/> only part of the performance gap.<lb/> What these trends tell us is that there are ways<lb/> that governments and schools can help students<lb/> from immigrant backgrounds to overcome<lb/> some of the disadvantages associated with<lb/> that background. Often, students with an<lb/> immigrant background are socio-economically<lb/> disadvantaged. On average across OECD<lb/> countries, the parents of these students are less<lb/> educated and work in lower-status occupations<lb/> than their native peers. in addition, these students<lb/> tend to have access to fewer educational and<lb/> material resources at home than their native peers.<lb/> so, for example, if the socio-economic status of<lb/> students in Luxembourg is taken into account,<lb/> the performance gap between immigrant and<lb/> native students there narrows from 52 to 19 score<lb/> points. On average across OECD countries, the<lb/> gap is reduced from 43 to 27 score points when<lb/> comparing students of similar socio-economic<lb/> status, regardless of whether they are from<lb/> immigrant backgrounds or are native to the<lb/> country in which they were tested.<lb/></p>

			<p>But the fact that a performance gap equivalent<lb/> to well over half a school year persists, even<lb/> after accounting for socio-economic status,<lb/> implies that other factors also have an impact on<lb/> student performance. To some extent, these may<lb/> be related to where the students were born –<lb/> for example, whether they are second-<lb/>or first-generation immigrants – or whether,<lb/> when they&apos;re at home, they speak the same<lb/> language as that used in the PisA test.<lb/></p>

			<p>The bottom line: School systems can nurture immigrant students&apos; full social<lb/> and economic integration into their adopted country by identifying the<lb/> obstacles to high performance that are particular to immigrant students and<lb/> developing programmes that are tailored to meet these students&apos; needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Yet given that the performance gap varies so widely across countries, even taking into account these other<lb/> characteristics, and given that in some countries the performance gap has changed markedly over time,<lb/> it is clear that public policy can make a difference. For example, effective language education is key:<lb/> students who do not understand their teachers will not be able to learn from them.</p>
