It is also a crucial precondition for the country to make progress in the European integration (EI) process 
as the capacity of national administrations to undertake the obligations linked with European Union (EU) 
membership is a key criterion in the assessment of candidate preparedness. Although there is no formal acquis in this area, previous experience and ongoing accession processes 
demonstrates that the preparations for EU accession and membership need to be underpinned by policy 
planning, development, co-ordination and implementation arrangements that:  
enable consistent policy planning and co-ordination of the Government activities, including 
priority setting;  
create polices that are not deficient in substance, are consistent with one another, are 
economically efficient and financially sustainable;  
include consultation with internal and external stakeholders;  
ensure that policies are properly implemented, communicated and monitored;  
support transposition and implementation of the acquis in all sectors;  
lay the foundations for operating effectively as an EU Member State. The requirements for policy planning, development, co-ordination and implementation arrangements 
and capacities need to be enhanced as a country progresses along the path to EI. Kosovo is at a crucial 
stage of the EI process, with negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) started 
in 2013 and formally concluded in July 2014. Entering into the SAA implementation process requires a 
new arrangement for EI structures and transposition of the EU acquis, as well as more efficient policy 
planning and decision making, and higher policy development and implementation capacities. This review is the second in a series of SIGMA policy making reviews, looking into required policy making 
arrangements and the capacities of Kosovo. Covering both the Government and the Assembly, the 
review provides an in-depth analysis of the key aspects of Kosovo's public governance capacities in policy 
making and co-ordination. On the basis of this analysis, the review suggests how policy making capacities 
may be further enhanced. Section one examines Kosovo's central co-ordination and horizontal planning systems in place, including 
the arrangements for policy analysis and monitoring within line ministries and planning the co-ordination 
of EI affairs. Section two concentrates on policy development procedures and capacities, including 
interministerial consultation, policy analysis and meeting EI requirements. Section 3 analyses the legal 
and institutional framework for parliamentary policy making and examines the Assembly's performance 
in the exercise of central policy functions, including: legislation, budgeting, executive oversight and 
control, and, as a cross-cutting function, the Assembly's responsibilities in the process of negotiating SAA 
and the harmonisation of Kosovo's legal system with EU law. This review draws on a range of materials and data collected in 2013, including national legislation, 
central and sectoral planning documents, reports, international and national studies, working documents 
and data collected during the preparation of the study as well as numerous interviews with practitioners 
in the Kosovo administration. 4 The review was led by Keit Kasemets of the OECD SIGMA Programme, with substantial expert 
contributions from Juhan Lepassaar from the Estonian Government Office, Klaus Goetz from the 
University of Munich and Rachel Holloway from the OECD SIGMA Programme. Klas Klaas from SIGMA 
and Michal Ben-Gera provided valuable feedback and support in preparing and finalising the review. The 
review team would also like to thank Sabiha Shala who assisted with the data collection in Kosovo and 
Ruzhdi Halili, Eset Rama, Besim Kajtazi, Demush Shasha and Ismet Krasniqi from the Kosovo 
administration for their thorough support. 5 LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS APSAA Action Plan for Stabilisation and Association Agreement BOs

Working Committee for European Integration 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS Policy planning and co-ordination in the Government The first part of the review analyses the functioning of the centre of government (CoG) in Kosovo. The 
legal framework for policy planning and co-ordination is broadly in place and does not require any 
substantial changes in the coming years. Key laws and the Government Rules of Procedure (RoP) 
adopted in 2011 are in line with European values and practices, and are very ambitious compared with 
the existing capacities of Kosovo's administration in terms of what is expected from the policy 
co-ordination bodies and the ministries. The legal framework needed for embedding transposition of the 
acquis into law drafting and policy making practices is in place. The institutions fulfilling the functions of the CoG in Kosovo are the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), 
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of European Integration (MEI). Overall, the roles of these 
three organisations are well-established and responsibilities between them are clearly divided in most 
cases. The OPM's adherence to relevant procedures has led to a stage of maturity, where they are 
broadly followed by all stakeholders. Proper institutional set-up has been created both in the OPM and 
the MEI, and the responsibilities inside the CoG institutions and the ministries are largely respected. 
Therefore, the overall set-up and structure of the central co-ordinating institutions provide a good basic 
level of preparedness for coping with the increasing workload derived from the EI process. Central planning instruments, such as the Government Annual Work Plan (GAWP) and the Action Plan for 
Stabilisation and Association Agreement (APSAA), are used and are partly consistent with each other and 
with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The ability to plan ahead and include 
implementation costs in forward planning within ministries is still weak. Backlogs due to overburdening 
and unrealistic political expectations exist. Overall planning of the Government's work is of a rather 
technical nature and different units' efforts inside the CoG are often fragmented and lack co-operation. 
The capacities of all structures to implement an ambitious legal framework are still limited. Therefore, Kosovo should maintain the system's stability, avoiding major changes in the overall set-up 
and procedures, instead focusing, in the next few years, on steps to strengthen and deepen the 
functioning of the legal and administrative system already in place. Key recommendations 1. 
Increase the coherence of planning of the Government's work and decrease delivery backlogs Short-term (1-3 years)  
Improve capacities (increase the number of available positions and provide training) of the 
Strategic Planning Office (SPO) of the OPM in the following fields: policy analysis, prioritisation and 
objective setting, development of strategies, and impact assessment.  
Translate the Declaration of Priorities (adopted by the Government in April 2014) into concrete 
and coherent sectoral priority measures when preparing the GAWP 2015.  
The planning format and process to be streamlined by the MEI, as well as the reporting on various 
EI processes, in particular SAA, visa liberalisation, implementation of the feasibility study priorities. 8  
In co-operation with the SPO and the Government Co-ordination Secretariat (GCS) of the OPM, 
under the co-ordination of the Steering Group for Strategic Planning (SGSP) and using the 
Departments of European Integration and Policy Co-ordination (DEIPCs) in ministries, harmonise 
the development of the GAWP 2015 as well as EI planning documents concerning process and 
priorities 1 .  
Under the co-ordination of the SGSP, ensure that SAA negotiation commitments are integrated 
into EI and domestic planning documents, in particular the GAWP and the MTEF.  
Firmly apply planning criteria to ensure the annual backlog carried into the coming year of 
strategies to be adopted decreases considerably: a) When preparing the four-year Government Programme for the new Government and the 
GAWP Plan 2015, introduce a rule where only sectoral strategies can be included in the annual 
plan of strategic documents. Exemptions from this rule should only be made in specific cases, 
such as EI requirements for a more targeted strategy or other international and domestic 
requirements; b) Gradually move to only sectoral policy strategies being developed by ministries in order to 
consolidate the strategic planning system.  
Gradually channel all key EI and national planning and policy co-ordination activities through the 
DEIPCs.  
Under the co-ordination of the SGSP, harmonise (and, if possible, merge) reporting on the new 
Government Programme and EI-related strategic plans.  
Gradually introduce gradually programme budget elements into the budgetary planning system 
and strengthen both the overall and sectorial prioritisation of the MTEF. Long-term (4-5 years)  
Gradually introduce performance indicators when reporting on key Government strategic 
documents (EI, Declaration of Priorities and Government Programme).  
Incorporate overall and sectoral performance indicators in the Government Programme and the 
GAWP during the next election cycle or change of coalition.  
Define monitoring of the implementation of sectorial strategies as a clear task for the SPO of the 
OPM, launch a reporting system to the Government on the implementation of sectoral strategies 
as an integrated part of the GAWP and introduce regular outcome based reporting on the 
implementation of the MTEF.  
Merge sectoral strategies with ministries' development strategies. Policy development in the ministries This part of the review analyses the policy development arrangements and capacities of Kosovo, 
including planning for implementing EI activities and transposing the acquis. Similarly to policy planning 
and co-ordination, the legal framework for policy development is in place and sets ambitious standards 
for the CoG institutions and ministries. Capacities of all structures to implement the ambitious legal 
framework are limited. 1 Sources for the priorities should remain the same -for the GAWP, the main sources are the Government 
Programme and the Declaration of Priorities; for the EI planning, the main sources are the SAA and visa 
liberalisation processes. 9 Procedures are followed by the ministries, but the whole process has a technical and formal nature. 
Interministerial consultation processes and policy analysis are at the first stages of development, where 
formal requirements are mostly met but the level of actual policy discussion is modest. The system of 
concept papers has been launched which, if implemented rigorously, would be a remarkable 
contribution to strengthening policy analysis. Initiatives of the involved CoG institutions (the Legal 
Department and Government Co-ordination Department of the OPM and the Ministry of Finance) to 
improve the system are not always well co-ordinated. There is room to improve policy development structures and procedures in the ministries. Responsibility 
for policy development is not clear and the share of staff in the departments dealing with policy 
development is low. The acquis transposition process introduced requires tables of concordance. The 
capacity of the ministries in law approximation is understandably low and should be increased gradually. Ministries have generally launched co-ordinating structures to deal with EI co-ordination, strategic 
planning and policy development. This is to be commended. However, these structures need to be 
enhanced as these units' capacity to deliver is hampered, mostly due to a lack of standing in one 
ministry, a shortage of staff or lack of skills and expertise. However, some promising champions, such as 
the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), seem to be emerging already. Key recommendations 1. 
Increase the capacity of the CoG to co-ordinate and the ministries to develop 
and implement policies Short-term (1-3 years)  
Improve the quality of concept papers by increasing the capacities for quality control and provision 
of day-to-day guidance of the CoG institutions responsible for policy and legal development and 
fiscal analysis.  
Consider adjustments in the Government sessions to enable more active and timely involvement 
of the Council of General Secretaries in the preparatory process.  
Strengthen the Council of General Secretaries' role in the Government decision making process as 
a main body for handling interministerial disputes, as well as discussing and deciding on horizontal 
issues.  
Review how new principles introduced by the Government RoP in late 2011 have contributed to 
improving the quality of policy discussions, and review how interministerial dialogue takes place 
between ministries and the central government. Consider the results and implement any 
necessary changes.  
Increase, through training and reallocation of staff, policy analysis capacities of the OPM's key 
departments providing more comprehensive analytical advice to the Government and more active 
steering of ministerial inputs.  
Define a coherent joint approach by CoG institutions to the improvement of policy development 
instruments and capacities, such as financial impact assessments (FIAs), cost evaluations of new 
policies, concept papers, etc.  
Strengthen the capability of line ministry staff to fully account for implementation issues and 
potential financial impacts when developing policies, strategies and drafting legislation.  
Develop the capability of line ministries to properly integrate non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) and the public into the policy making process by providing written guidance and training 
on consultation methods. 10  
Launch a policy planning and strategy development capacity building programme for functional 
and policy departments starting with DEIPCs, legal departments and key policy development 
departments in the ministries mainly responsible for meeting requirements in the EI process, 
namely MTI, Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), Ministry of Justice (MJ) and the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development (MAFRD). This programme can then be gradually 
extended to policy departments in all ministries.  
Analyse the internal policy development processes of the ministries to more clearly define the 
responsibilities of key departments and management levels in policy development. Find ways to 
strengthen the policy development departments. Long-term (4-5 years)  
Build on the fiscal impact assessment process and introduce a wider process of policy analysis that 
evaluates a full range of costs and benefits and wider issues, such as potential environmental and 
social impacts.  
Launch an ex-post evaluation of policy initiatives and laws to review whether, once implemented 
they are achieving the original objectives. 2. 
Root created mechanisms and develop capacities for effective transposition of the EU acquis Short-term (1-3 years)  
Gradually enforce the adopted regulatory and normative acts which establish a framework for the 
application of tables of concordance and clarify the division of labour of different departments and 
authorities involved.  
Enhance the capacity of the ministries' EI departments through staff evaluation, recruitment and 
training to better implement the new SAA-related processes, and tasks related to the tables of 
concordance. Ensure that all staff in EI departments have sufficient English skills and at least one 
lawyer in key ministries has adequate knowledge of the relevant acquis. In allocating resources for 
staff increases, prioritise those ministries that deal with a greater burden, such as the MTI, 
Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), MIA foremost, and the MoF, Ministry of 
Infrastructure (MI) and MAFRD secondly.  
Enhance the MEI's co-ordination capabilities through better political prioritisation of actions and 
by giving priority to the SAA process and imposing stringent criteria for including new actions in 
the framework planning documents. At the same time, allow ministries some flexibility in deciding 
the timeframes for delivery of objectives. This would enable the MEI to lead the process in a more 
systematic and targeted way and reduce backlogs.  
Review the functioning of the co-ordination system with a view to streamlining the reporting and 
planning mechanisms in a more unified system and ensuring a smooth transition from SAA and 
EPAP parallel structures to a unified co-ordination structure.  
Increase the budgetary planning capacities of the ministries and ensure that the procedures that 
enhance forward budgetary planning (including concept papers and financial impact analyses) are 
rigorously applied through all stages of the EI process.  
Strengthen the co-operation between the LO and the MEI and consider adopting the policy of 
issuing joint legal opinions (at least for pivotal EI-related acts) to avoid giving conflicting signals to 
ministries and ensure the homogeneity of legal oversight. Long-term (4-5 years)  
Move towards a central single EI planning framework which would set clear and measurable 
quantitative or qualitative targets to assess progress. 11  
If the EI process progresses to a more advanced phase (i.e. accession negotiations), re-address the 
issue of how to involve the majority of cabinet members in the substantial preparatory political 
discussions. Policy making in Parliament The basic political and administrative structures of the Assembly are in place, in particular rules and 
regulations, and processes at political and administrative levels to plan the Assembly's work and carry 
out its main functions. However, the parliamentary policy making role in Kosovo is especially challenged 
in at least two ways. First, the legal system is still in the process of maturing, so that many aspects of economic and social life, 
in particular, continue to await regulation through detailed parliamentary legislation. Between the end of 
March 2011, at the beginning of the IVth Assembly, and June 2013, i.e. within a little more than two 
years, the Assembly approved 164 laws, the majority of them being completely new laws rather than 
amended legislation 2 . There are, accordingly, great pressures on the legislative capacity of the Assembly, 
and there is a concomitant danger that other parliamentary business, notably oversight and control, may 
become marginalised. Second, there is, on the one hand, a strict institutional separation between the Government and the 
Assembly, most visible in the constitutional provision that prohibits members of the Government to hold 
an Assembly mandate. The emphasis on separation raises problems of effective executive-legislative 
co-operation. On the other hand, in some important respects, notably when it comes to its own budget 
and personnel, the Assembly is constrained by a lack of autonomy from the Government. Regarding EU integration, the Standing Committee for EI has been given extensive responsibilities under 
the Assembly's RoP, with a special focus on the review and supervision of  " the process of harmonisation 
of laws enacted by the Assembly with the legislation of the EU " . Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive 
legal framework governing the powers and responsibilities of the Assembly in the EU integration process, 
and the Committee's role is geared towards review and co-ordination rather than the introduction and 
formulation of initiatives or detailed legislative scrutiny and amendment. The IVth Assembly shows major improvements in parliamentary policy making capacity, whilst there is 
awareness at both the political and administrative levels of the Assembly that further organisational 
development is required. The options for change briefly highlighted in this section focus on major 
organisational questions that affect both political and administrative structures and processes. Key recommendations 1. 
Increase capacity of the Assembly through improving functionality division of the Committees, 
strengthening the legal framework and increasing its independence. Short-term (1-3 years)  
Open meetings of the Presidency to a representative of the Government charged with handling 
executive-legislative relations to improve the co-ordination of work between the Government and 
the Assembly. Such a representative should not, have voting rights but should act as a source of 
information, allow the Presidency to express concerns about the flow of legislative business 
coming from the Government and act as an interlocutor when it comes to handling complaints 
about unanswered parliamentary questions. 2 See the regularly updated  " Evidence on processed and adopted laws " , available on the Assembly's 
homepage: http://www.kuvendikosoves.org/?cid=2,191,97, last accessed 3 July 2013. 12  
Review the functionality of the division of labour between the Committee for European 
Integration and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and between the Committee for European 
Integration and the Committee of Legislation. It is worth exploring a structure in which all political 
aspects of integration are dealt with in a Committee for European and Foreign Affairs, whilst 
questions of compliance and harmonisation are dealt with in a Committee for Legislation and 
Harmonisation.  
Reconsider the legal status of Assembly personnel. It is not, at this stage, self-evident that there is 
a need for a law regulating the civil service status of Assembly staff, but there is a strong a case for 
supplementary regulations that do justice to the special conditions in the Assembly.  
Reconsider the legal framework governing Assembly personnel policy and the administration of its 
budget to reduce dependency from the MoF and the Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) staff 
recruitment and budgeting processes.  
Create a comprehensive legal framework that sets out how the Executive and the Assembly 
co-operate in the area of EI. Such a framework needs to set out, in particular: o the rights of the Assembly to information in EU-related matters and the informational duties 
of the Executive (i.e. the types of information provided by the Executive, the timing of 
information to be made available, the parliamentary procedures for processing the 
information and the parliamentary rights for probing the information); o the rights to discuss and adopt parliamentary positions on the matters concerned, such as 
negotiation mandates; o the obligations on the part of the Executive to take parliamentary positions into account; o the rules and procedures for direct contacts between the Assembly and EU institutions.  
In line with evolving practices in EU Member States, consider introducing additional oversight and 
control instruments that are principally geared to enhancing institutional and policy performance. 
As concrete tools: o Foresee regular performance reviews in new sectoral legislation, so that evaluation and 
assessment are enshrined in legislation. o Create additional instruments that allow Deputies to solicit information from the Government, 
notably extended written questions to be answered by the Government or individual 
ministries. Long term (4-5 years)  
Analyse the consequences of the structural reform of the Assembly once the new structure has 
had a chance to settle down, and its effects on the performance of the Assembly administration 
can be assessed more systematically.  
Encourage flexibility in the allocation of staff resources across functions, not least in response to 
the uneven flow of parliamentary business during the year.  
Since it might not be possible to increase the overall number of staff servicing committees, enable 
the sharing of staff across them. The allocation of scarce staff resources must be driven by the 
identification of the key political functions performed by the Assembly, i.e. it must be led by 
demand.  
After analysing the impacts of conducted reforms and exhausting effects provided by flexibility 
measures, move towards larger and more cohesive departments. 13 1 
POLICY PLANNING AND CO-ORDINATION IN THE GOVERNMENT 1.1 
Legal framework The main elements of the legal framework include: organic budget law 3 ; the Law on State 
Administration 4 ; and the Regulation of Rules and Procedure of the Government 5 . The legal framework 
specifies the responsibilities of the OPM, provides authority to assume these responsibilities, and creates 
a framework for co-ordinating activities between key institutions at the centre of government, namely 
the OPM, the MEI and the MoF. The general EI-related legal framework consists of the Government Decision No. 6/121 of 22 April 2010, 
Regulation No. 07/2010, and Regulation No. 32/2012, which established the MEI, created (and later 
amended) its internal structures and adopted interministerial structures for the EI process. With its latest 
EI-related decision, the Government has established the SAA negotiation structures. These acts empower 
the MEI to lead the EI process by initiating and driving the planning process (including Instrument for 
Pre-Accession [IPA] resources); monitoring the implementation activities (including the quality of 
harmonisation of the acquis); and reporting on the progress made. Government Regulation No. 01/2011 
also established specialised EI departments (Departments for European Integration and Policy 
Co-ordination – DEIPC) within all line ministries. Analysis of main challenges The legal framework is substantially complete and of generally high quality. It provides a good basis for 
the management of all aspects of the policy process, including planning and monitoring, policy 
development, policy co-ordination, and decision making. The legal framework clearly defines and divides the responsibilities between the OPM, the MEI and the 
MoF. In the SIGMA interviews conducted for the purpose of this review, all counterparts confirmed that 
informal co-operation and information exchange among the three government bodies is smooth. The legal framework provides a transparent mechanism for conducting EI processes and, in a rather 
detailed manner, also defines all the specific tasks and obligations of the different parties involved. The 
empowerment of the institutions that fulfil leading roles in the EI process (MEI in particular) fits well 
within the overall and system of governance architecture in Kosovo. 1.2 
Planning the work of the Government The legislative framework stipulates four central planning documents: the GAWP, the APSAA 6 , the MTEF 
and Medium Term Declaration of Priorities (DP). Three of these (the APSAA, the MTEF and the DP) have 
a medium-term planning dimension. 3 Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability (17 December 2003). 4 Law No.03/L – 189 on the State Administration of Kosovo (16 September 2010). 5 Regulation on RoP of Kosovo, No. 09/2011. 6 The APSAA replaced the EPAP in late 2012. 14 According to Article 47 of the Government RoP, the Government approves by the end of December of 
each year a Government Work Plan for the following calendar year. The plan is prepared in accordance 
with the guidelines and instructions issued by the OPM and it is considered to be the principal planning 
and implementation document of the Government. The GAWP covers both legislative and non-legislative matters, as well as the preparation and 
implementation of strategies. The legislative tasks and commitments for developing strategies are 
summarised annually in separate annexes to the work plan. The GAWP includes a prioritisation 
mechanism consisting of two sections: section A concentrates on activities needed for the 
implementation of the strategic priorities, and section B encompasses all activities of ministries. Regulations define mechanisms for ensuring coherence among central planning documents. Every item 
foreseen under the GAWP has to make reference to other planning documents, such as the Government 
Statement of Priorities, the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Economic Vision and the MTEF. The RoP are in place to link policy planning with annual and medium-term financial planning, although 
they are implemented with varying degrees of success, mainly through the strategic objectives. 7 
However, there are also requirements to link the GAWP to budget decisions and to include projected 
costs. In addition, the RoP specify the responsibility of ministries to provide the calculation of public 
revenues and expenditures for new initiatives. Fundamental to this is the requirement that the MoF 
reviews and approves the fiscal analysis 8 . Requirements exist for linking the GAWP with the EI process. The guidelines on the preparation of the 
GAWP foresee a 'reference to EPAP/APSAA.' Moreover, Article 48 of the RoP expects the GCS of the 
OPM to co-ordinate the preparation of the GAWP with the MEI. The RoP of the Government obliges the SPO and the GCS to issue general guidelines to enable better 
planning and more detailed guidance of the methodology for the GAWP, including strategies and a 
legislative programme 9 . Guidance materials are also provided by the MEI to support the preparation and 
monitoring of the APSAA. The reporting and monitoring system is embedded in the legal framework. Ministries have to transmit 
data to the GCS quarterly for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the GAWP, including data 
on the extent to which each activity has been achieved, whether the deadline has been met, and an 
assessment of any problems encountered in the implementation and recommendations for remedial 
action. Any recommendations for amendments to the work plan can be submitted for approval to the 
Government sessions. A similar process for monitoring the legislative programme is in place, with the LO 
able to create a mechanism for its implementation 10 . Also, the GCS quarterly monitors implementation

purpose of monitoring the implementation of this programme, ministries follow 255-259 of Guidelines for 
the design of the Annual Report of the Work of the Government, and 261-265 of the Guidelines for 
monitoring the implementation of Government Decisions. 15 Analysis of main challenges Kosovo's legislation provides a solid framework for ensuring the coherence of the Government's central 
planning documents and enabling linkages between the GAWP and the work plans needed for EI and the 
budgetary process. The overall structure of the GAWP, including a section for priority activities and 
annexed plans for legislation and strategies, enables efficient planning of the work of the Government. 1.2.1 
The Government decision making process The Government's decision making procedures and requirements are defined mainly in the RoP, adopted 
in late 2011. The RoP regulates in detail the process of preparing meetings of the Government (including 
the responsibilities of various co-ordinating offices of the OPM and the MEI, the MJ and the MoF), as well 
as the organisational aspects of the meetings. The RoP also regulates the decision making procedures of 
the Government. Compared to the previous RoP, there is now a stronger emphasis on policy 
development and policy analysis. The RoP clearly specifies the documents that must be presented to support items on which the 
Government must make a decision at Government meetings. In addition to the explanatory 
memorandum, a concept paper (policy paper) should accompany a policy proposal or a draft law. A fiscal 
impact assessment is also required, and it must adhere to the template provided by the MoF. The requirement of a policy paper to be submitted for Government discussion prior to legal drafting for 
all proposals, except those of a minor nature, is a new principle in the RoP of 2011. To allow the 
Government to make informed decisions, ministries have to send policy analysis that includes the 
consideration of different options and their consequences 11 . This policy analysis must be prepared in the 
format of a concept paper. In addition, Article 26 of the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability (LPFMA) states that 
whenever the Government considers a new law or an amendment to an existing law to be sent to the 
Assembly, the Government shall first require the sponsoring ministry or body to submit to the 
Government and the MoF a budgetary and economic impact statement that provides a detailed 
assessment of the likely effects of the proposed legislation on the Kosovo budget and its economy. Also, 
the sponsoring ministry shall prepare a report indicating the source or sources of funding, for such a 
draft law will require the expenditure of public money in the fiscal year during which the law is adopted. The Government has also adopted legal acts to establish the interministerial co-ordination mechanisms 
for EI-related decision making. The first layer of these structures was set-up with a Government decision 
in 2010, which established the Ministerial Council (sometimes referred to as committee) for the 
Co-ordination of the European Integration Process (MCEI), chaired by the Prime Minister (PM). The main 
task of the MCEI is to function as a political decision making forum where all the EI-related issues are 
solved and agreed before their formal adoption by the Government 12 . The members of the council 
include the Minister of the MEI (as Deputy Chair) and the Ministers of Finance and Economy, Public 
Administration, Local Government Administration, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs and Justice. Below the MCEI is the Working Committee for European Integration (WCEI), which is chaired by the 
Minister of the MEI. The WCEI consists of representatives of all the ministries (and some Government 11 Articles 28, 29 and 36 of the RoP of the Government. 12 Among the MCEI's other tasks are to: co-ordinate the uniform state policy, as well as development and 
implementation of the strategy of Kosovo for integration into the EU (including the EPAP); define the main 
priority areas and deadlines for their enforcement; discuss the negotiating positions before their adoption 
by the Government; ensure a well-planned and comprehensive process of approximation; co-ordinate the 
development and activities related to the capacity building of the ministries; prepare the Government's 
decisions on the use of EU and EI related bilateral assistance. 16 bodies), and is responsible for preparing the work of the MCEI and running routine monitoring of the 
implementation work. Under the working committee, the system relies on seven sectoral executive 
committees, which consist of experts from ministries and are tasked with preparing the EPAP plans and 
implementing the commitments taken. All three co-ordination forums – the MCEI, WCEI and executive 
committees – were initially dedicated to the co-ordination of tasks deriving from Kosovo's aim to deepen 
its integration with the EU. With the launch of the stabilisation and association process, a new set of co-ordinating layers were 
established in early 2013, such as the position of Chief Negotiator (ex officio MEI minister) and the 
Negotiation Team at ministerial level to prepare negotiation positions and commitments. The decision 
also established the post of Negotiating Team Secretary (Secretary-General of MEI) and created three 
SAA Negotiation Working Groups to prepare and conduct negotiations at the technical level, two of 
which (legal approximation and co-operation policies) are headed by MEI, and one (trade issues) by the 
MTI. Analysis of main challenges A proper procedural framework for Government decision making and policy development has been 
created by the OPM, the MEI and the MoF. The specific regulations – especially the Government RoP – 
are highly sophisticated and hence establish an ambitious benchmark for the existing capacities of 
Kosovo's administration in terms of what is expected from the CoG bodies and ministries. However, this 
provides a good model to strive towards. The procedural aspects of policy analysis and policy development still require attention, especially 
concerning handling and steering policy analysis issues, in particular concept papers, at the CoG. 
Responsibility for co-ordinating policy development and policy analysis is not precisely established in the 
legislation. This has led to a situation where MoF deals with the financial issues of concept papers, and 
the LO, the SPO and the GCS all are involved in processing and providing feedback on concept papers. 
Responsibility for development of the system and guiding ministries is scattered. The legal framework for EI is in place and is sufficient for a country which is in the phase of starting SAA 
negotiations. As some key elements have been introduced only recently and there is no widespread 
implementation practice, the legal framework might merit additional fine tuning after the SAA 
negotiations have been finalised. For example, although the normative acts needed for embedding and 
transposing the acquis into law drafting and policy making practices have been adopted, they have been 
used in practice in only a few cases. The crucial issue at the CoG level is to ensure the MEI's role in monitoring that the draft bills related to 
the EU acquis conform with the general legal framework, which gives the tasks of legislative 
co-ordination and oversight to the LO of the OPM. The RoP of the Government (Article 42) give the LO 
quite a broad mandate not only in ensuring the overall co-ordination of legislative drafting of all draft 
laws that the Government submits to the Assembly, but also in empowering the LO to ensure (through 
instructions and assistance) that the drafts the ministries submit adhere to the overall legal framework of 
Kosovo and follow the overall standards and quality of legislative drafting. This means that the MEI and the OPM should work closely together to ensure full compatibility between 
Kosovo's legal order and that of the EU. Although this co-operation already exists at the informal level 
and the working relationship is described by both sides as 'cordial', further steps could be taken to 
formalise this relationship at the procedural level. As the integration process advances, the transposition 
effort will increasingly penetrate all policy fields and every facet of legal order. To ensure that the 
transposing acts adhere to a single legal logic which takes into account the aims of the acquis, as well as 
what is viable within Kosovo's own legal order, the two bodies could issue joint legal opinions to the 
ministries on EI-related acts. This would also avoid having the two 'overseers' issuing contradictory 
opinions to line ministries. 17 1.3 
Policy co-ordination and planning arrangements at the centre of the government (CoG) 1.3.1 
Coherence of the CoG Overall policy co-ordination and planning issues are regulated in the RoP. Responsibilities and functions 
of the CoG institutions are stipulated in regulations on internal organisations. The regulation for the OPM 
manages the structure and mandate of each office within the OPM 13 . The regulations of the MEI and the 
MoF also determine their competence on policy making issues. The MEI has the authority to co-ordinate 
composition and implementation of strategic documents relevant for EI, handle daily EI-related 
co-ordination issues, and check the compatibility of legislation with the EU acquis. The MoF has the 
competence to lead medium-term and annual budgetary processes and reviews and approve the FIAs of 
primary and secondary legislation and strategic documents. Existing co-operation of CoG institutions was formalised in June 2012 with the creation of the SGSP 14 . 
The group is led by the political adviser of the Prime Minister and assembles key officials from the OPM 
(directors of three key departments), the MoF (directors of budget and macroeconomic departments), 
the MEI (director of the EU assistance co-ordination department) and the MPA (director of public 
administration reform co-ordination). The Group's functions include establishing coherence of key 
Government strategic documents, taking into account the EI process priorities, harmonising budget and 
policy planning, as well as ensuring realistic planning and streamlining of foreign aid with Government 
priorities. Thus the SGSP is primarily co-ordinating planning issues. The main co-ordination forums for daily policy issues at the CoG are handled through informal regular 
meetings of the Deputy Prime Ministers (DPMs) and formal weekly meetings of State Secretaries. In 
2013, the number of DPMs was extended from five to six 15 . The horizontal responsibilities of the DPMs 
are legally fixed with the regulation on internal organisation of the OPM; the specific areas for which the 
DPMs are responsible are established through the informal distribution of functions. The PM holds 
meetings with the DPMs and the Secretary-General of the OPM twice a week. At administrative level co-ordination is formalised. The responsibilities of the weekly meetings of General 
Secretaries are set out clearly in the RoP 16 , covering consideration of items submitted to the Government 
sessions, discussion on the agenda for Government sessions, follow-up to implementation of the 
Government Annual Work Plan, and review of the EI process. The RoP also mandates the Council of 
General Secretaries to solve conflicting and unresolved issues between ministries. Analysis of main challenges The institutional architecture for carrying out policy development, co-ordination and planning functions 
at the CoG is in place. The CoG comprises multiple institutions but many are based within the Prime 
Minister's Office, making co-ordination easier. There is clarity at the administrative level about the 
respective roles of institutions and established procedures for co-operation and co-ordination among 
them. 13 A draft new regulation on internal systematisation of the OPM has been prepared, but was not yet approved 
by the Government at the time of compiling this review. 14 Government Decision No. 05/83 on the Establishment of the Steering Group for Strategic Planning (11 July 
2012). 15 According to the regulation on the organisational structure of the OPM, adopted by the Government in June 
2013, a DPM shall be responsible for a special field of importance and high priority for the Government, but 
may also co-ordinate a sphere of policies within the responsibility of few ministries. 16 Chapter VIII of the RoP specifies the competences/responsibilities of the Council of General Secretaries. 18 Co-ordination forums contribute to policy planning. The composition of the SGSP is adequate, and the 
definition of its functions sufficient to ensure a harmonised and efficient strategic planning system. 
However, additional efforts by all counterparts should be made to fully exploit the benefits of the SGSP 
and assure its sustainable and effective functioning. Since its formal creation, the SGSP has met only 
three times and has not been the joint decision making centre in relevant strategic planning processes. 
The planning and implementation of key processes (EI, public administration reform (PAR), the review of 
the legislative programme) are regular weekly items on the agenda of the Council of General Secretaries, 
which creates a good basis for whole-of-government planning and enables discussions of key 
implementation challenges. Regular preparatory discussions of the Government session agenda items by the Council of General 
Secretaries has the potential to efficiently address contentious issues of the ministries before the 
sessions. However, developing the capacity and tradition of dealing with these issues effectively takes 
time: analysis of minutes of the Council meetings demonstrates that the emphasis of discussions is 
currently on providing an overview by the OPM of items included in the agenda. On very few occasions 
were contentious issues actually raised by the ministries. With six Deputy Prime Ministers, political-level co-ordination is a challenging task. However, clear, 
informal mandates of the DPMs and informal working processes created for preparing decisions of the 
Government, are meeting the challenge relatively well 17 . 1.3.2 
Structure of the OPM The OPM has over 15 departments fulfilling functions set by government regulation on the internal 
organisation of the OPM and in some cases (e.g. the Office of the Co-ordinator of the Strategy of the 
North of Kosovo) by specific law. Also, the number of the central state administration bodies reporting to 
the OPM was extended to six with the new regulation on internal organisation of the OPM 18 . The key 
departments for policy making and co-ordination are the GCS, the SPO and the LO, but also the Public 
Communication Office (PCO) is involved in the Government decision making process. Directors of these 
departments are well connected to the relevant policy co-ordination forums (they all are members of the 
Council of General Secretaries) and with the Prime Minister's advisers. The SPO has a direct 
subordination to the Prime Minister, being at the same time accountable for administrative issues to the 
General Secretary. Other key departments are accountable to the General Secretary. Each key 
department runs its own co-ordination network in the ministries; these networks contribute, among 
other things, to the preparation of Government sessions. Responsibilities of the key departments are 
defined in the RoP. 17 Before an item is included on the agenda of the Government session, it is sent to the responsible DPM and 
the responsible adviser of the PM for approval and feedback. The Secretary-General of the OPM acts as a 
liaison between politicians and the highest administrative level concerning Government decision making 
issues. 18 Regulation No.16/2013 on the organisational structure of the OPM was approved in 123 meeting of the 
Government of Kosovo with decision No.06/123 (5 April 2013). 19 Table 1. Functions of the OPM in policy making and co-ordination Organisation

issues. Sources: RoP; draft regulation on internal organisation of the OPM; interviews with OPM staff. There are regular, weekly meetings of the Secretary-General with the Directors of the Offices within the 
Government Secretariat. They may discuss issues related to the forthcoming Government session, 
although the focus of the meetings is wider. Analysis of main challenges Internal co-ordination within the central government works well. The system has reached the stage of 
maturity where each department knows its responsibilities in fulfilling one of the core functions of the 
OPM – planning the work of the Government and handling Government sessions – and is capable of 
providing quality outcomes flexibly and within tight timeframes. The OPM has leverage in relation to the 
ministries and has been able to set-up procedures which are followed by all stakeholders. Remaining challenges are related to the rather fragmented and cumbersome structure of the OPM, 
some grey areas between the key departments and the capacity of key structures to meet with high 
quality all responsibilities established by the RoP. The OPM comprises various departments with very different tasks, for example the Office for issues of 
Categories Deriving from the Kosovo Liberation Army War. Agencies under its supervision also cover a 
broad range of areas, for example the Veterinary and Food Agency. This is a legacy from the 
pre-independence era, and it would be useful for Kosovo to continue the process of transferring some of 
these functions to relevant ministries. Supporting departments and key departments for policy co-ordination and government decision making 
are accountable to the General Secretary, others to the Prime Minister's Cabinet. A high number of 
rather small departments with a wide scope of functions requires substantial management from the PM 
Cabinet staff and the General Secretary, and makes the design and implementation of coherent strategy 
for the whole organisation, as well as daily management, challenging. The number of staff in key departments is modest compared with the overall size of the OPM. According 
to the draft regulation on internal organisation, the SPO has 5 positions, the GCS 12, the LO 11 and the 
Communication Office 6, but not all of these are filled. Staffing issues are particularly challenging for the 
SPO. This creates some capacity issues in fulfilling all the responsibilities envisioned by the RoP, in 
particular in setting priorities, planning in substance the work of the Government and providing 
analytical support to the PM and the Government. As per normal practice, all main departments are involved in the key processes of the OPM: policy 
planning and co-ordinating government decision making. Responsibilities established by the RoP do not 21 exclude overlaps between departments, particularly concerning analytical tasks and handling materials 
submitted to the Government sessions. In practice, however, no remarkable duplications exist due to the 
limited capacity of departments. At the same time, the arrangement of each department looking at 
submitted documents from its own perspective has led to some key processes having many contributors, 
creating co-ordination challenges. A good example is concept papers where the formal responsibility of 
the GCS for ensuring their overall quality could be supported by a much stronger co-ordination role in 
practice, including commenting on substance, co-ordinating inputs and activities of the CoG actors, and 
guiding ministries towards higher quality materials. 1.3.3 
The MEI and co-ordination structures for EI Recent organisational changes, prompted by the new systematisation, have been introduced within the 
MEI. These were steps in the right direction and, overall, the MEI's internal structures and development 
plans accommodate the new challenges of the process 19 . In addition to the departments that lead the 
planning, monitoring and co-ordination efforts of the EI process 20 , the MEI has a separate unit to oversee 
the harmonisation effort (Department of EU law) as well as a new, separate unit for co-ordinating donor 
assistance. It is important to note that the MEI has, since the start of 2013, introduced formal practices 
to foster interdepartmental co-operation, especially between the EU law department and other 
functional departments (including the department dealing with IPA). The EU law department now 
participates in preparatory meetings when IPA assistance and SAA Action Plans are discussed and, in 
return, the EU law department involves the functional departments in the formulation of its legal opinion 
once the ministries submit draft EI-related laws. As indicated above, with the launch of the SAA process, a second layer to the interministerial 
co-ordination mechanisms was introduced with the establishment of the Negotiation Team and the 
Working Groups for SAA negotiations. The Negotiation Team is chaired by the Minister for the MEI and 
consists of ministers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the MAFRD, the MoF, the MTI, the 
Ministry of Economic Development (MED), and the MJ. In addition to these co-ordination layers, the MEI also administered an EI Task Force, a broad forum 
consisting of representatives from the administration, NGOs, academia and interest groups, brought 
together to draft a new national EI strategy, which was adopted by the National EI Council on 7 October 
2013. The strategy is a framework document which aims to solidify a broader national consensus around 
EI goals, which could then facilitate compromises on important, specific EI-related reforms. It deals with 
five topics: 1) effective governance, 2) the rule of law and the fight against organised crime, 3) economic 
growth, 4) the enhanced involvement of stakeholders and 5) regional co-operation and development. It 
does not address the operational side of EI, which is left to the GAWP and the SAA Action Plan. As the Task Force was an ad hoc mechanism with the sole purpose of drafting the strategy, the MEI has 
no plans to continue with it and therefore it will be abandoned. However, the National EI Council 
convened by the President of Kosovo, which sees itself as a consensus-building platform and which 
complements to some extent the Parliament's EU committee, will continue. Its secretariat consists of 
two members from the President's Office and one member from the MEI. Its discussions normally 
focussed on major specific policy areas or reforms (such as PAR), to discuss and assess progress and 
problems involved. With the adoption of the national EI strategy, there are plans for the National Council 19 The reform of organisational structures took into account analysis and recommendations made by the GIZ. 
See Engelman, Andrej (May 2012),  " Strengthening of the European Integration Process and Structures " ; 
Support to the European Integration Process in Kosovo, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit GmbH. 20 Such as the Department of Political Criteria, Department of Economic Criteria and Internal Market and 
Department for Sectoral Policies. 22 to monitor, perhaps once a year, progress in implementing the national EI strategy and to use the MEI 
and the established co-ordination mechanisms (such as the WCEI) as implementing and reporting 
channels. As the National Council does not directly influence operational policy planning and neither are 
they part of the operational co-ordination system of the executive, it will not be considered in the 
functional analyses of the co-ordination system. 23 Figure 1. General architecture of Kosovo's EI co-ordination system Source: MEI. Analysis of main challenges The co-ordination system has all the necessary arrangements at the political, higher administrative and 
expert level, which should ensure the proper leadership, planning, monitoring and reporting functions 
necessary for Kosovo in its current stage of the EI process (Figure 1). The co-ordination system is 
relatively well equipped to set enforceable deadlines and to monitor and report on the progress made. However, the potential of interministerial co-ordination mechanisms is not fully exploited as both MCEI 
and WCEI function mainly as reporting mechanisms on the progress of commitments and forums of 
information exchange regarding the reasons for these problems and delays. This pattern is also followed 
in the other interministerial forums established for more specific tasks. The assessment of interviewees 
is that both administrative and political level forums give little input into policy or decision making 
processes (for example, providing decision makers with real alternative policy choices, or solving 24 technical-level disputes). There is some evidence which indicates that the situation is gradually changing 
and these forums (Trade Council, WCEI) are more often used also as decision making and 
problem-solving bodies. Feasibility study short-term and medium-term benchmarks and SAA 
negotiations are a good trigger for more substantive discussions on problematic issues, which indicates 
that when the EI agenda advances, the nature of the discussions changes and interministerial forums 
have good potential to develop into interministerial decision making centres. In terms of the functioning logic of the system, one can make a distinction between the interministerial 
mechanisms adopted at the political, higher-administrative and expert levels. On the other hand, the 
system is also divided between two functional work processes: the new SAA process and the old EPAP 
and more general EI process. In this context, three issues can be outlined. First, the coherency of the system is guaranteed mainly through the MEI, which functions as the central 
co-ordinator between the different levels (expert to political) and two functional pillars (SAA and EPAP). 
The fact that MEI's role has been strengthened should be commended. Second, at the political level, the role of the Minister for European Integration is crucial to ensure the link 
with the PM and the Cabinet. This gives the process the necessary political leadership and clout, which 
are useful for prioritisation, as well as the appropriate arbitration tools to solve conflicts. In the future 
development of the system, great care should be taken to maintain and strengthen both the institutional 
and non-institutional linkages between the Minister for EI and Head of the Government. Third, at the expert level, the fact that the SAA and EPAP structures are different for the expert groups, 
with different chairs and slightly dissimilar (though to some extent overlapping) membership and 
mandates (see Table 2), raises issues which should be closely followed after the SAA negotiations are 
finished. Knowledge and know-how gained from SAA negotiations needs to be transferred to the 
implementation side. Table 2. Comparison of expert level committees and their mandates 21 Sectorial executive committees (EPAP structure)

achieve their purpose, this might not be the best course of action. All policy co-ordination mechanisms 
will develop their own working practices and co-operation dynamic, and abolishing ad hoc structures 
once the original mandates are achieved may engender the loss of good practices and co-operation 
methods which could be transferred to the management of other processes in a more permanent 
framework (like the future accession process). 1.4 
Processes and implementation capacities 1.4.1 
Planning the work of the Government There is a clear set of Government priorities (Statement of Priorities), approved by the Government each 
year. The source of the priorities is the Government programme 2011-2014, Plan for implementation of 
Economic Vision 2011-2014 (for economic area), sectorial and sub-sectorial strategies and political 
decisions of the Government. The method of communicating priorities to the ministries is not regulated; 
however, the process is being improved at a practical level each year. Priorities are developed through a 
consultative process, whereby ministries propose priorities for their area of competence. However, the 
final selection of priorities is done by the SGSP and is forwarded to the Government for a decision. The preparation and approval of the Government's strategic priorities and work programme, and its link 
to the budget, is co-ordinated by the OPM. The development of the Declaration of Priorities, which also 
feeds into the MTEF, is co-ordinated by the SPO of the OPM. Part A of the GAWP is composed of the 
Government priorities. 26 Monitoring the implementation of the GAWP is co-ordinated by the GCS; ministries give a progress 
report on a quarterly basis 22 . The information is consolidated into quarterly and annual 
government-wide reports by the GCS and submitted to the Council of General Secretaries. The annual 
report for the implementation of the annual work plan is published and distributed by the GCS during 
the first quarter of the subsequent year. Development and monitoring of key operational planning documents for the EI process is co-ordinated 
by the MEI. Until 2012, the key document was the European Partnership Action Plan (EPAP); it was 
replaced at the end of 2012 by the APSAA. The APSAA is targeted to timely implementation of 
commitments derived from the EI process, where reforms needed for SAA are prioritised. Coherence 
between the GAWP and the APSAA is sought by the administration: both documents are adopted by the 
Government at the same time, but there are no formal mechanisms for streamlining the development 
and reporting process. The OPM and the MEI have the authority to require that ministries submit their plans in line with 
priorities, and they can set the agenda for ministries. The system has formal mechanisms that require 
prudent planning in terms of setting achievable deadlines, creating links with budgetary resources to 
ensure implementation, and foreseeing and planning for other possible impacts. Both institutions have 
produced detailed guidelines for ministries to simplify the planning and reporting process. The MTEF is developed by the MoF; it is compiled for three years and is approved annually in April. It is a 
clear statement of the Government's priorities as set out in the DP, followed by macroeconomic and 
fiscal analyses, a sectoral expenditure analysis and individual fiches for budgetary operators, setting out 
objectives and three-year expenditure ceilings. Ministries compile various strategic documents; a list of strategies to be developed is annexed to the 
GAWP. In February 2013, 59 strategic documents were in force. Of these, 44 can be considered 
strategies and five have the characteristics of sectoral strategies, covering the policy field in full 23 . Analysis of main challenges Guiding the development of the Statement of Priorities and its application in the MTEF and GAWP 
development processes was a challenge for the SPO of the OPM in 2012, mainly due to vacant positions. 
The SPO was strengthened in 2013 with two additional staff. The process of developing the Statement of 
Priorities has been changed in order to move from macro-level priorities to sectoral-level priorities and 
to link priorities with the development of sectoral strategies and medium-term budgetary ceilings. The 
stated efforts are steps in the right direction and will strengthen the priority-setting and implementation 
capacities of the Government, including in the SAA process, and enable the more efficient use of scarce 
resources. Analysis of the coherence of key strategic documents – the MTEF and the GAWP – 
demonstrates that the situation improved in 2012, with both documents approved for the year 2013 and 
beyond being more coherent compared with the documents adopted in the previous year. Their 
structure and priority objectives follow the structure of the Programme of the Government and are 
largely consistent. However, in 2013, when developing the Declaration of Priorities 2014-2016 and MTEF for the same 
period, co-operation of the OPM with the MoF deteriorated. Commitment of the MoF to contribute to 
the development of the priorities to ensure alignment with the financial opportunities of the 
Government remains a challenge. The SPO of the OPM and the MoF are still applying a somewhat 
different approach to the Government priorities, leading to a modified version of priorities in the MTEF 22 The GCS evaluates the quarterly reports on the following three criteria: 1) quality of reporting; 2) meeting of 
implementation deadline; 3) level of implementation. 23 A list of strategic documents in force is provided by the SPO of the OPM; concrete numbers are derived from 
expert analysis of the stated list. 27 compared with the Declaration of Priorities prepared by the SPO and approved by the Government. As 
the guardian of financial resources, the MoF must accommodate the Government priorities within the 
funding opportunities of the state, a consideration which is not fully taken into account during the 
development of the priorities statement. Better co-operation is therefore needed between the MoF and 
the OPM, and mechanisms need to be built into the planning process to frame the prioritisation exercise 
within short and medium-term funding opportunities. The planning of coherent sectoral measures in the MTEF, GAWP and APSAA has improved, but can 
evolve further. Whilst remarkably improved, compared to 2012, the integration of EI priority measures 
into other key strategic documents can be further enhanced. This analysis demonstrates that the planning involved in the implementation of Government priorities 
still varies between individual ministries, so overall planning quality depends on ministerial capacities. 
The planning of work in policy areas that fall under several ministries is still challenging for the 
administration. Table 3. Coherence of key strategic documents 24 MTEF

27 and expert analyses. 24 In order to analyse coherence of the documents' structure, objectives and measures of the MTEF and GAWP 
were compared. To analyse coherence of the MTEF and GAWP with the EPAP (2012) and APSAA (2013), 
inclusion of EPAP/APSAA objectives, priority measures and sectoral measures in the MTEF and GAWP were 
assessed. 25 When the structure of the documents in the section of priorities and in sectoral sectors was the same, 
documents were assessed as consistent. When the difference was not more than one heading under each 
priority area (in the case of sectoral sections, priority objectives and measures), documents were assessed as 
largely consistent. When up to three headings differed, documents were considered partly consistent. When 
the difference was greater, documents were considered slightly consistent or not at all. 26 See categorisation above. 27 MTEF 2012-2014; MTEF 2013-2015; GAWP 2012; GAWP 2013; EPAP 2012; APSAA. 28 The analysis of 2012 working practices and the study of key strategic documents demonstrate that both 
the OPM and the MEI have the capacity to guide the development process of the GAWP 2013 and the 
APSAA respectively. The process for the development of these documents has been streamlined in terms 
of timing. Both documents were adopted at the last Government session of 2012. Nevertheless, the 
analysis of the documents and working practices demonstrates that prioritising the various obligations 
remains a challenge, in the case of both EI-related processes and policy making in general. The linkage between planning priorities and the budgetary process can be still improved, in particular at 
the level of ministries. The MTEF 2013-2015 comprises narrative material regarding high-level 
governmental priorities and strategic objectives, which are complemented by objectives and associated 
resources at the level of individual ministries or budgetary operators (BOs). The BO-level material 
includes an overview presentation of mission, context (current situation), objectives and activities, 
together with an allocation of resources in aggregate terms to each activity. This descriptive material is 
clearly and logically presented and has been significantly streamlined from the previous year's MTEF. 
Each BO chapter also includes the more formal, tabular presentation of expenditure ceilings on a 
functional rather than programmatic basis. Since the functional tables form the basis of the budget 
appropriations, and of subsequent audit by the Office of the Auditor General, the programmatic 
allocations are indicative rather than normative. In principle, this process sets the foundation for a coherent strategy-driven approach to resource 
allocation and is a basic, potentially useful  " presentational "  approach to performance-type budgeting, 
with some elements of the more developed  " performance-informed "  approach. In practice, the 
alignment between the objectives at the central government level and BO-level objectives is not 
apparent, and there is little cross-referencing from the BO level back to the broader priorities. 
Understandably, there is no visible linkage between these priorities and budget allocations. Evidence obtained from interviews indicates that for some EI-related obligations, ministries feel 
considerable pressure from the centre (MEI, OPM) towards more ambitious deadlines and feel bound to 
accept those deadlines, which may be clearly undeliverable from the start. Comparative analyses of the 
2012 EPAP with the 2013 APSAA indicates that, on average, 36% of primary legislation that was planned 
for adoption in the EPAP was delayed and subsequently incorporated into the 2013 APSAA with renewed 
deadlines. However, ministries that have more than an average number of primary law-drafting duties 
are overburdened. They also tend to be the ministries with more postponed deadlines, such as the MI, 
the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW), the MAFRD, and the MESP (Figure 2). At the same time, specific tasks within the EPAP and APSAA, as well as in the GAWP, are usually formed 
bottom-up, with little scrutiny or prioritisation from the centre (although more with EI matters, due to 
the European Commission's Progress Reports). The OPM and the MEI should, implement more stringent 
criteria to focus on the most important tasks and scale the workload down to more manageable levels, 
bearing in mind the limited resources (budgetary resources included) and the capacity in ministries. 29 Figure 2. Backlog of EI-related primary acts (from 2012 to 2013 and beyond) Sources: EPAP 2012; APSAA 2013; and expert analyses. Monitoring of the implementation of key strategic documents is regular, has a quarterly rhythm and 
provides an overview of the general implementation record of each ministry. The analysis of 
implementation reports of the GAWP and EPAP demonstrates the technical nature of the GAWP 
reporting 28 , which concentrates on taking stock of delivered items. The EPAP reporting also provides an 
overview of implemented activities and does not go into the real implementation or achievement of 
objectives. In the current stage of the system's maturity, this level of reporting is sufficient and meets 
the general expectations of the European Commission and the Government, although it creates 
additional administrative burdens with parallel reporting requirements from the OPM and the MEI. For now, monitoring mechanisms do not distinguish between process implementation, such as the 
amount of secondary legislation that has been enacted and achievement of intended outcome or for 
example, the amount of road infrastructure built and poverty levels reduced. Consolidation of the overall strategic planning system remains a challenge. The state of play of planning 
sectorial policies is still fragmented, with a huge tendency for unrealistic planning and visible bottom-up 
pressure leading to unrealistic plans that have not been prioritised. A total of 48 strategic documents 29 
were planned for adoption in 2012 30 , but 34% were carried over to 2013 due to the backlog. In 2013 28 Analysis of implementing the Annual Plan of the Work of the Government, 1 st , 2

for a consolidated planning system, especially as the implementation record of the annual plan is very 
low. In 2012, only 8% of the strategic documents foreseen were adopted by the Government, showing 
unrealistic planning but clearly demonstrating the efforts of the SPO to guide ministries towards wider 
sectoral strategies and decrease the number of fragmented policy documents 32 . Figure 3. Strategy development, backlog and planning implementation record Sources: Annual Plans for Strategic Documents 2012/2013 and SPO of the OPM. Most ministries are reporting on the implementation of their strategies regularly. The quality of the 
reporting varies and they rely mostly on reviewing the status of planned activities. However, 
performance data and outcome indicators are occasionally used in the process. 31 Annual Plan for Strategic Documents for 2013 (annexed to the GAWP 2013) and Annual Plan for Strategic

Government decision making Principles for holding Government sessions are regulated in detail in the RoP. It establishes procedures 
and requirements for submitted materials as well as consultation, and defines the roles of the relevant 
OPM departments and other key stakeholders. Materials should be submitted to the OPM 15 days 
before the Government session. The RoP also specifies the schedule and recipients for materials 
distributed before and after the meetings, such as the agenda and minutes. The invitation, agenda and 
materials for agenda items must be sent to the relevant units no later than three days before the 
Government session. Draft minutes of the meetings are circulated three days after the session with the 
feedback deadline of two days. The General Secretary provides a detailed overview of what was decided 
in the Government session in the following week's Council of General Secretaries' meeting. There is also 
a formal procedure to enable the consideration of urgent issues at a Council of Ministers' session 33 . The Government Secretariat is authorised to return items submitted to the Government sessions to 
ministries if the substance is problematic or other requirements are not fulfilled. For example, material 
can be sent back to ministries if the proposal does not contain the opinion of the MoF, the MEI and the 
LO, or if it is not in line with the GAWP and/or Government priorities. In practice, however, the GCS 
resolves issues more informally. It usually consults the proposing ministry and requests additions or 
clarification rather than sending documentation back. For example, no items were sent back to ministries 
in the fourth quarter of 2012 34 . EI issues and legislation needed for transposing the acquis follows the same procedure as all Government 
agenda items. However, the MEI is responsible for providing an opinion on harmonisation with the 
acquis. The LO of the OPM follows transposed norms in line with the Constitution and general legal 
framework. Until recently, the MEI was responsible for checking that the proposed legislation does not 
contradict with the acquis. The requirement to steer transposition of the acquis was introduced only in 
2013. Analysis of main challenges The overall co-ordination cycle ensures the involvement of key stakeholders and enables inputs at both 
the political and administrative levels as well as sufficient time for processing the dossiers for the OPM. 
Interaction between the political level (the DPMs and advisers of the PM) and the administrative level 
(General Secretary of the OPM and key directors) is active, and the roles of different levels are clear and 
respected by the relevant actors in the process. Government sessions are regularly held on Wednesdays 
and the agenda is set either on the Friday of the week before, or on the Monday after the PM and the 
DPMs have met. The current timing of the Council of General Secretaries meeting, regularly held on 
Tuesday mornings, reduces opportunities for the Council to be active in the preparatory process, and 
restricts the channels available to the ministries for designing session agendas and holding discussions on 
immediate, disputed issues. On Tuesdays, the agenda for the upcoming Government session is already 
fixed and the discussion therefore mainly provides an overview (by the General Secretary) of what is 
included in the agenda. Co-ordination of session preparations happens routinely, and relevant rules and time periods are 
generally well adhered to. The GCS has applied a flexible and communicative practice for solving issues 
openly with the ministries and improving the quality of the dossier. Interviews revealed that 60% of the 
items on the agenda are submitted through the normal procedure (15 days ahead), whereas 40% of 33 Article 33 of the RoP specifies the cases; the reason for the use of the emergency procedure shall be clearly 
reported to the Government and the Minister responsible for the proposal shall, immediately after the 
Government's discussion of the proposal, ensure that the procedures required under this regulation are 
complied with and reported to the Government as soon as practicable. 34 According to the interviewed official at the GCS. 34 items are included three to four days before the Government session takes place. Only 1% of agenda 
items are added at the very last minute or through the urgency procedure described in the RoP. An 
average of ten items per agenda is manageable for the OPM. In a comparatively small administration with many issues on its agenda which require a rather rapid 
response from the Government, the 15-day submission deadline is too restrictive for ministries, and is 
therefore often not followed. An average of four items out of ten submitted three to four days before 
the session suggests that this is indeed the case. As three to four days does not provide the OPM enough 
time to handle the dossier according to normal working practices, a high volume of late submissions can 
lead to overburdening of the OPM structures and decreasing the quality of their input. Sufficient time for 
processing the materials is crucial: in addition to the basic technical checks, more time allows for 
high-quality analytical input and deeper involvement with the substance of the materials. The GCS has a main co-ordination role concerning Government decision making preparations and 
monitoring its decisions. The LO and the SPO are contributing in their area of responsibility in relation to 
legislation, and strategies and priority items, respectively. Both departments routinely provide input on 
dossiers submitted by the ministries. These departments are also involved in the earlier stages of policy 
development, guiding and advising ministries on preparing items to be approved by the Government, as 
well as supporting initiation of relevant preparatory processes. The LO is involved in the preparation of draft laws from the very initial phase. For example, the MTI has 
created a working group for drafting an amendment to the Law on Consumers, of which a representative 
of the LO is a member. If a ministry decides not to create a working group for drafting a law, the person 
in charge within the ministry has to inform the LO of their progress monthly. Once the ministry approves 
the first draft, the legal department sends it to the LO for comments. The final draft is sent once more to 
the LO for its opinion. The SPO also participates in the strategy development process managed by 
ministries. The prioritisation of issues takes into account the limited resources of the SPO, but active 
support for the ministries in the preparatory stages is an opportunity for the OPM which could be better 
exploited. It increases the quality of the materials submitted by the ministries and decreases the 
workload of processing the files submitted to Government sessions. In leading and co-ordinating EI-related decision making and policy development, the MEI has 
under-exploited its existing tools available to incorporate EI commitments into national working 
practices, to act as a watchdog and quality controller of the acquis transposition and give valuable 
feedback to ministries on the matter. Evidence considered from only a few examples of randomly 
selected and translated legal opinions prepared by the MEI showed that the analysed opinions 
concentrate on formalities rather than on content. One ministry demonstrated the case by stressing that 
it had to redraft and resubmit one quarter of all legislative acts in 2012, which had previously been given 
the green light from the MEI via its legal opinions. It later emerged that these acts failed to transpose the 
directives they were supposed to. Also, the MEI concentrated only on the text of the law itself, without 
addressing possible problems in achieving the aims of the acquis. The MEI's capacity to give meaningful 
feedback thus remains a challenge. The recent decision of the MEI to assign members of staff in the 
relevant departments as contact points for each ministry, and to co-ordinate activities between the MEI 
and relevant ministry therefore merits approval. The MEI employed in 2013 four to five lawyers, and although the anticipated number of staff members is 
seven, this will still not be enough to cope with the workload. It is also clear that the real expertise of the 
sectoral acquis should be developed within the ministries. The MEI should focus not only on the 
approximation of the text of law itself but also more on possible problems regarding delivery of the aims 
of the acquis. As the EU itself will increasingly emphasise the need to achieve actual and measurable 
progress in different policy fields (on commitments made by Kosovo), in order to proceed with the EI 
process the MEI could also replicate this in national planning by putting more emphasis in the planning 35 documents on achieving measurable progress of real outcomes on the ground. An outcome-based 
approach is not anything new, and is already used by the MTI in defining their yearly priorities 35 . This 
practice could be developed further by enhancing the MEI's capacity to lead this shift and provide 
feedback to guide ministries should be planned. In this respect, the decision of MEI to nominate members of its staff in relevant departments as 
contact-points for each ministry, to serve as focal points for co-ordination activities between MEI and the 
ministry, merits approval. The Government should focus in the coming years on strengthening the 
capacities in the central co-ordination bodies (OMP, MEI, MoF). 35 The booklet entited  " MTI priorities of 2013 " not only sets desired qualitative aims and outcomes but also 
tries to budget for and co-ordinate the use of different aid programmes for different tasks. 36 2 
POLICY DEVELOPMENT IN MINISTRIES 2.1 
Legislative framework The new policy development procedures and requirements ministries must follow were established in 
the RoP adopted in 2011 and enforced at the beginning of 2012. Compared with the previous version, 
the RoP introduced new elements for enhancing the use of policy analysis and changed the 
interministerial consultation and co-operation principles used for policy development. Since the beginning of 2012, the originating body of a draft policy proposal is obliged to send a policy 
analysis or concept document for approval to the Government before drafting the legislative act. Within 
a month of the approval of the policy analysis/concept paper, the responsible ministry should start 
drafting the legislative acts in compliance with the deadlines set out in the approved GAWP 36 . Concept papers usually precede new primary legislation or amendments to primary legislation, 
important secondary legislation, and recommendations that have significant social, economic or other 
impacts. Concept documents also precede proposals that have high implementation costs, or represent 
important Government or ministry priorities 37 . Interministerial consultation is required for all policy proposals, although there is no requirement to 
consult all ministries, only the central state administration and those affected by the proposal. The 
requirement to create inter-ministry working groups was in place from 2007 to 2011 but discontinued 
under the current RoP 38 . It is too early to say whether and what impact this has had on the policy making 
process. The process is summarised in Figure 4. Ministries have 15 working days to comment on the proposal, although this deadline can be shortened if 
the ministry needs a more timely response for reasons of genuine urgency outside its control, or 
lengthened if a more thorough examination is required. 39 Requirements for consultation are mandatory and ministries should consult relevant institutions in 
advance of drafting concept papers, explanatory memorandum, draft laws or sub-legal acts, a strategic 
plan of a ministry or a sectorial strategy for deliberation by the Government. Key government 
stakeholders who must be consulted are well defined, and the RoP also covers the list of institutions 
which should be consulted when defined criteria are met. The originating body is also obliged to consult 
the public 40 . The RoP specifies which institution and stakeholders should be consulted and at which stage 
of the proposal. 36 Articles 28, 29 and 38 of the RoP. 37 Article 29 of the RoP. 38 Articles 38 to 41 of the RoP. 39 Article 7 of the RoP. 40 Articles 7 and 32 of the RoP mandate consultation. 37 Figure 4. Stakeholders in the interministerial consultation process Source: The RoP, interviews. The RoP does not specify what methods of consultation should be used, but does make it clear that the 
originating body is obliged to send the concept paper or draft law to the relevant institution for 
consultation and, once the consultation is closed, detail the comments received from the other bodies 
together with an indication of whether such comments were incorporated in the proposal and, if not, the 
reasons why 41 . Analysis of main challenges Kosovo has made good progress in enhancing its approach to policy development, although the process 
is still hampered by varying skills and capacities within the ministries and poor availability of data and 
statistics. The RoP provides a sufficient policy development framework for the ministries, which follows 
practices used in the EU and OECD countries. 41 Article 7 of the RoP. 38 Introducing the principle of using concept papers for policy analysis in the early phase of the policy 
making process was a step in the right direction. The current RoP does not require ministries to establish 
interministerial working groups for preparation of draft law/policy documents, so policy staff from other 
ministries or the Government Secretariat may not be involved in the initial policy development phase. 
However, ministries are still establishing internal working groups, where policy staff from other 
ministries can be involved. This has been the case when policy papers were developed in 2012 by the 
Ministry of Health (MH) and the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS). The CoG is involved in the 
prior consultation phase and when the ministries send the final draft to the GCS/LO. At these stages, 
they are supposed to check the quality of the concept document or explanatory memorandum. The 
newly introduced approach involves the risk of decreased policy consultations and may impact the 
quality of legislation; however, it is too early yet to assess the functioning of the new system. 2.2 
Policy development arrangements and capacity in the ministries 2.2.1 
Policy development structures The structure of the ministries and the responsibilities of management positions and departments are 
outlined in each ministry's regulations on internal organisation and systematisation of positions. The 
reorganisation of all ministries was taking place whilst this review was being conducted; this process is 
co-ordinated by the MPA. As a general logic, all ministries should have a similar structure, composed of 
policy departments, whose number and tasks are not centrally decided; functional departments, such as 
the DEIPC and Legal Department (LD); and supporting departments, such as a Finance and General 
Services Department, a Communication and Public Relations Division, a Public Procurement Division and 
an Internal Audit Division. Each ministry is headed by the General Secretary, which has a small support 
office. There is also the Cabinet of the Minister, consisting of Deputy Ministers, political advisers and 
support staff. The responsibilities of the two functional departments are determined through horizontal legislation. 
The work of the legal departments is guided by several pieces of horizontal legislation, in particular by 
the administrative instruction on organisation and scope of legal services of the Government of Kosovo 42 . The creation of DEIPCs in all ministries was launched centrally in 2011. The authority and responsibilities 
of these departments are established by regulation 01/2011, which details functions of DEIPCs for all 
ministries except CoG institutions -the MEI, MoF and OPM -which have the flexibility to organise 
themselves. These departments in the ministries are responsible for policy co-ordination and planning, 
as well as co-ordinating EI issues. As a general rule, there are specific divisions within the DEIPC for 
fulfilling those functions. Whilst performing their tasks and duties, ministries tend to maintain regular co-operation with the OPM, 
MEI, and the MoF. The guidance for the EI agenda to these departments comes from the MEI, and the 
guidance for the strategic planning and identification of ministerial priorities comes from the SPO of the 
OPM. Relations with the MoF are not formalised and/or institutionalised. Analysis of main challenges The reorganisation of the organisational structures of ministries creates the opportunity to establish 
policy development roles within ministries more clearly, and integrate functional departments into 42 Administrative instruction No. 13/2007 on  " Organisation and Scope of Legal Services of the Executive 
Branch – Government of Kosovo "  sets the structure and functions of Legal Departments, which are 
responsible for, among other things, drafting policies and legislative strategies, drafting primary and 
secondary legislation and ensuring the compatibility of laws and other bylaws with the EU acquis. 39 mainstream structures and working practices within each ministry. Similar organisational structures 
should support interministerial co-operation and make administration more transparent. However, analysis of the regulations on internal organisation and the systematisation of working 
positions reveals that responsibilities for policy development are often not explicitly set out in the 
regulations. As a general practice, in EU and OECD countries, policy development is a key function of the 
administrative apparatus of the ministry, with responsibilities determined at a higher managerial level 
and clear functions established for policy departments. In the case of Kosovo, the analysis of regulations 
from five ministries approved by the Government up to April 2013, reveals a common pattern where a 
triad – the LD, DEIPCs and line departments ─ are involved in policy development and drafting of 
legislation, but it is not clear who takes the lead. In most cases, line departments ensure implementation 
of policies, analyse situations and handle monitoring as well as data collection. A commonly used term 
for responsibility over legislative processes is  " co-operation with the Legal Department in drafting 
legislation. "  Terminology varies more in the developing of policies and strategies where, in some cases, 
line departments are expected to draft policies and, in other cases, contribute to policy development. 
Often, common terminology is not applied for all line departments at the same ministry; rather, each 
department has its own interpretation of the roles. According to regulations on the internal organisation of ministries, in cases where policy development 
responsibility is clearly set, it is assigned to a department and its director, who fulfils this responsibility in 
co-operation with other departments and with the Cabinet of the Minister. Higher administrative 
managerial positions – the General Secretaries, for example – are not formally responsible for policy 
development; however, they submit the dossier to the OPM for the Government sessions. Interviews in 
sample ministries confirmed that policy development happens mainly at the level of the department and 
has a rather technical nature. Final policy decisions are taken in the Cabinet of the Minister, which 
processes all the files before they are sent out from the ministry. The policy development capacity of the ministries remains a challenge due to staffing: policy 
development departments still account for only a modest share of overall positions compared to 
enforcement and administrative support functions. Figure 5 below illustrates the distribution of staff 
across the four key functions within two line ministries 43 . In OECD and EU countries, ministries have different types and functions, for example in some countries 
the whole enforcement staff (e.g. tax inspectors or teachers) is ministry officials and belong to the 
department of the ministry. Therefore, comparisons between the countries are hard to make. However, 
some conclusions can be drawn when analysing ministries in a given country and comparing results with 
the countries with similar administration set-up. 43 The categorisation of staff is made according to four categories: 1) Policy; 2) Enforcement; 3) Functional 
support, such as legal departments and co-ordination of EU affairs; 4) Administrative support staff. To 
enable more precise analysis and to demonstrate that ministries have different type of tasks, one category 
(enforcement) was added to the categories used by Kosovo authorities in the reorganisation process. This 
approximate categorisation was undertaken by SIGMA, based on commonly recognised roles within 
government administrations. The Secretary-General's Office and the Cabinet of the Minister are excluded 
from the data set, as the aim was to compare staff numbers in key departments. 40 Figure 5. Share of positions in different departments MTI 
MAFRD Source: Data provided by MTI and MAFRD through questionnaire. Although the cases of these two ministries do not provide a complete picture (in MAFRD enforcement 
functions is understandably more relevant compared with the MTI), they allow indicative conclusions to 
be drawn. When excluding the enforcement function, the share of administrative staff is more numerous 
in both ministries compared with the number of staff in line departments. Figure 6. Percentage of staff in policy, functional and administrative departments Source: Data provided by MTI and MAFRD through questionnaire. 33% 29% 36% 2% Policy Enforcement Administrative

Functional MTI MAFRD 41 Analysing the allocation of positions in the Ministry of Local Government Administration 44 confirms these 
conclusions. 31% of positions (41 in total) were allocated to policy development departments. Out of 
those, around 40% deal directly with policy development issues and 60% concentrate more on 
enforcement. The share of functional departments is 25% and administrative departments is 44%. Such a 
distribution of resources impairs the capacity of the ministries to handle the policy development 
workload and implement a high-quality process with proper policy analysis. Ministries have generally launched structures to deal with EI co-ordination, strategic planning and policy 
development. Departments for EI and Policy Co-ordination (with slight variations in precise title) exist in 
all ministries. However, as the ministries were free to choose how best to arrange the new structure, 
there are still three ministries which have other units with a similar mandate, which risks confusion and 
duplication of functions. For example, the MIA has the department for co-ordination and the DEIPC, and 
the MPA has the DEIPC and the department of PAR, whose scope is similar. These departments are embryonic and suffering from some challenges. They are not fully staffed and are 
not widely recognised within some ministries. For example, in Kosovo's 2013 Budget Law, only three 
ministries (MTI, MoF and MJ) made note of a separate EI department; the other ministries have 
submerged the department within the subheading  " central administration "  and the average staffing rate 
at the end of 2012 was 78%. As the DEIPCs are relatively new and were set-up by a central order, it is not 
surprising that the actual profile of the departments and their ability to fulfil these tasks varies 
considerably. The actual capacities of all structures to implement ambitious goals are very limited. Still, some promising bright spots such as the MTI seem to be emerging already. In the MTI, the EI 
department has been able to partly fulfil the tasks of a policy co-ordination unit, leading the preparation 
of horizontal strategies (merging the existing 11 into a single horizontal strategy) and co-ordinating the 
preparation of the Ministry's annual plans (including budgetary plans). But in most cases they seem to 
lack an actual presence within ministries' policy making processes and thus have little impact on content. 
The majority of EI departments in the ministries seem to function as post offices with little capacity and 
limited expertise on substance. In most cases, the EI departments are also not sufficiently staffed. Moreover, neither the actual nor 
planned staff numbers adequately reflect the needs deriving from planned obligations a given ministry's 
EI department must monitor and report on, or generally co-ordinate and give input into, as per the 2013 
SAA Action Plan. The analysis summarised in Figure 7 indicates that the EI departments in at least three 
ministries, MTI, MESP and MIA, have larger workloads in comparison with obligations than those in other 
ministries. 44 Regulation No. 03/2013 on the Internal Organisation and Systematisation of Jobs in the MLGA. 42 Figure 7. Obligations foreseen in the 2013 SAA Action Plan in comparison with staff numbers Source: MEI, APSAA 2013. The above chart is, of course, indicative and fails to present a comprehensive picture. For example, the 
obligations for the MAFRD are probably higher in reality, as the Veterinary and Food Agency (curiously 
formally under the PM's structure) has a number of obligations, including legislative and regulative, that 
are not covered in the analyses, but involve the MAFRD at least indirectly. Nevertheless, it indicates 
broad trends and gaps. In this regard, the MoF, MH and MI also have a considerable number of 
obligations in comparison with staff members in their EI departments. It is important to note that the 
picture does not change when the number of obligations is compared to the overall number of 
employees in ministries' central administrations, or those in the offices of ministers. If anything, the 
contrasts between the 'overburdened' and the rest become even sharper (Table 5). The need to 
strengthen the staff capacities of the more overburdened ministries is clear. As any additional budgetary 
allocations will be limited, the budgetary applications for additional staff recruitment in the more 
burdened ministries should be a priority. Only once their essential needs are satisfied should the staff of 
DEIPCs in the rest of the ministries be increased. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 MTI

the staff's profile, skills and expertise. Interviews indicated a sizeable gap in skills and knowledge as well 
as desired profile. Although some officials have been recruited through the Young Cells scheme, and thus 
have a good educational background and knowledge of English, others lack either language skills or 
understanding of the EU legal system, or have limited insight on the specifics of the acquis in a given 
field. All interviewees (MEI, MTI, MIA, MAFRD, OPM) pointed to the lack of language skills and 
knowledge of EU law as main shortcomings. 44 2.2.2 
Policy development processes The policy development process as established by the RoP, and the main principles of policy 
development and interministerial consultation, were already described in this review. Here it is analysed 
how responsible stakeholders are implementing the principles and to what extent the process is 
followed by the ministries. Special attention is given to the implementation of novelties introduced with 
the new RoP, namely conducting policy analysis and holding interministerial consultations. Policy analysis includes the consideration of different options and their consequences in order that the 
Government can make adequately informed decisions. The extent and complexity of the analysis should 
be proportionate to the importance of the issue, for example where it ranks in the Government's 
strategic priorities. The policy analysis shall be conducted with the preparation of a concept paper or 
explanatory memorandum and, in some cases, a fiscal analysis. Guidelines for conducting a FIA are 
issued by the MoF and are annexed to the RoP. The annex covers both the process and format for fiscal 
assessments. Whilst this review was conducted, the MoF was developing instructions for determining 
the form, content and procedures and cost of new policy initiatives. Separate guidelines for preparing 
policy papers are established by the OPM. There are some requirements and mechanisms in place for planning implementation in the policy 
development process, but these are not uniform. Not all materials submitted to the Government require 
an implementation plan. For example for two key topics – the GAWP and legislation – there is no such 
requirement. However, or strategic documents, details about implementation are required to be 
submitted 45 . The FIA has a section which addresses implementation issues including guarantees, loans, 
or other actual or contingent obligations on the Government. There is no requirement to conduct an 
ex-post evaluation of implementation of Government policies. However, there are monitoring 
arrangements in place to assess the implementation of the GAWP and other decisions of the 
Government. During the interministerial consultation process, the MoF, the OPM, the MEI and other relevant 
institutions are consulted twice: on the first and on the final drafts. A ministry shall submit the final draft 
of the law/proposal to the Secretariat 15 days before the Government meeting at which it is to be 
discussed. This permits the Government Secretariat to verify that the materials are complete and can be 
submitted to the Government meeting for approval. Relevant line ministries and other stakeholders are 
consulted once, on the first official draft. The consultation process with non-governmental stakeholders shall be conducted in accordance with the 
Guidelines for Public Consultation Process 46 . They specify that the originating ministry shall publish the 
substance of its proposal for public comment and shall specifically seek the comments of any 
non-governmental organisation that would be affected substantially by the proposal. In conducting this 
consultation, the originating body shall provide sufficient information in a publicly understandable form 
to permit the public to comprehend the nature and consequences of the proposal. The originating body 
also must publicly announce the beginning of the consultation and permit sufficient time for the public 
and non-governmental organisations to consider the recommendations and offer a considered 
response 47 . The results of such consultations shall be reported to the Government meeting or Ministerial 
Committee as part of the concept document or explanatory memorandum. The Guidelines do not specify 
a minimum or maximum period of time allowed for a Government response. 45 Article 10 of administrative instruction 02/2012 on preparing Strategic Documents and Plans for their 
Implementation. 46 Issued by the Legal Office in September 2011. 47 Article 32 of RoP. 45 Concerning the internal processes of the ministries in submitting materials to the Government session, 
the General Secretary of each ministry is designated to submit all required documentation to the 
relevant part of the OPM. The legal department sends the first and final drafts to the General Secretary 
and Cabinet of the Minister through the General Secretary. However, the materials for the proposed 
laws are not always reviewed at the meeting of the General Secretary and the Directors of Department 48 . 
Co-operation between key functional departments and line departments has an informal nature; there 
are normally no formal internal procedures, and in each ministry the process depends on the leverage of 
each department and traditional working practices. The ministries have new challenges in the policy development process derived from the SAA 
negotiations, and more widely from the intensified EI process. The legal framework for transposing the 
acquis is in place. However, the capacity of the ministries to follow the requirements and successfully 
fulfil the tasks required by the SAA process depends mainly on their ability to fully develop and make use 
of the system of tables of concordance. Although some ministries have already made the first steps in 
using this tool, the instrument is not yet fully functional and although the Parliament's RoP foresee that 
all draft laws submitted by the Government will be accompanied by the tables, the executive does not 
yet have the capacity to deliver on this. Analysis of main challenges The policy development structures in ministries are small, but they have proved to be effective and have 
been used flexibly, notably through working groups, to mobilise resources for particular analytical or 
preparatory work required prior to the elaboration of new policies. Interministerial and public 
consultation works routinely, but is often partial and at a fairly late stage in the drafting process. In total, 47 concept papers were submitted to the Government by 11 ministries in 2012. The largest 
number of them was developed by the MIA and the MoF (7 each). A sample of 15 concept papers was 
evaluated, which highlighted the varying quality of the analysis 49 . The examples analysed show that 
ministries do tend to fulfil the requirements of a concept paper, but the level of detail within each of the 
seven required sections, such as problem analysis and results of consultation with civil society, can be 
variable 50 . The policy analysis in the concept papers tends to be fairly superficial, often without financial 
analysis, or it is narrowly focussed on whether the proposal is affordable within the current budgetary 
agreement rather than in terms of the systemic impact (e.g. whether the proposal would impose costs 
on businesses). There could be greater alignment between concept papers and key strategic planning documents and 
budget management. The budgetary detail included in concept papers demonstrates an inconsistent 
approach to conducting budgetary impact analyses, and the level of detail and rigour is varied. The 
scheduling and handling of concept papers within the budgetary and policy making process has not yet 
matured to the point where the papers can maximise their impact on decision making. Whilst some are 48 The Director of the Legal Department should report about how the drafting process has taken place and, at 
the cabinet level, one of the Advisers of the Minister is supposed to review the materials. However, we 
found this not to be the case in all instances, based on the interviews carried out for the 2013 SIGMA 
Assessment. 49 Two concept papers per ministry were analysed against key documents regarding the policy making process. 
In terms of the content and quality of the analysis against key benchmarks, such as the extent of problem 
definition, the use of data and the scale of consultation. Three ministries were excluded from the analysis as 
English translations of their concept papers were not available – the MPA, the MH and the MTI. 50 Article 36 of the RoP specifies that seven areas should be covered: 1) problem analysis, 2) identification of 
options, 3) analysis of implications of options/impact assessment, 4) analysis of approximation with EU 
legislation, 5) fiscal impact analysis, 6) consultation with other ministries and public bodies, 7) consultation 
with civil society. 46 included in the Government's legislative programme, they are very rarely included in the APSAA or the 
GAWP. Figure 8. Compliance with the requirements for concept papers Source: analysis of 15 concept documents submitted to the OPM by ministries in 2012. The capability of ministries to plan ahead and to include implementation costs, as well as the capacity to 
scrutinise draft proposals within the CoG remains challenging. The ministries claim they do not have the 
capacity to carry out these tasks, as the requests are disproportionate to the number of assigned staff. 
Moreover, the instrument of the concept paper is a new process for the GCS and line ministries and, as a 
result, their capacities are limited. Ministries have begun to follow new requirements for interministerial consultations, although 
mechanisms and policy development deal more with process than content. Consultation input from 
external organisations is virtually non-existent. Random examples of consulting non-governmental 
stakeholders demonstrated good implementation of procedures, but feedback from them was very 
limited. For example, a draft law on Geographical Indications was sent by the MTI to all relevant business 
associations: no feedback was received from any of them. This is unfortunate, as consultation brings 
many benefits, including a greater likelihood of the proposed changes working, as stakeholders have 
been involved in the development of the solution from the outset and government processes become 
more transparent and accountable to the public. This process enables both governments and citizens to 
understand the costs and benefits of potential changes and to make informed decisions about legislation 
that affects their lives. The implementation of new principles for the transposition of the acquis, and using the tables of 
concordance in policy development, are still in their early phases. First, there is no coherent baseline 
which could be used in a systematic way for creating a horizontal list of acquis to be scrutinised during 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 MAFRD

Included in LP Total number of Concept Papers produced 47 legislative drafting. As there has not been any systematic screening exercise, the ministries do not 
appear to know which parts of EU legislation are relevant in different policy fields or where to find this 
information. There also does not appear to be a database which could be used to organise and save the 
relevant information which will be accumulated over time. This issue may be settled in a centralised 
manner as the LO has plans to establish a database, which could also accommodate information 
regarding transposition. There is also some confusion within the ministries regarding the division of labour between the Legal 
Departments and DEIPCs. The recently adopted Regulation on Legal Services should make the necessary 
clarifications. According to it, the legal departments of line ministries will be responsible for the tables of 
concordance ─ ensuring that they are accurate, formulated according to instructions, etc. ─ and 
co-ordinating the work of transposition. In this context, the issue of co-operation between the DEIPCs 
and legal departments of ministries merits some further clarification. It has happened that when 
ministries have to respond to new demands (for example, requests to respond to European Commission 
questions), DEIPCs are sometimes side-lined and issues are passed directly to legal departments or 
operational/functional departments in the ministries. As DEIPCs are in charge of overall monitoring and 
reporting of the EI process, they should be part of the discussion or at least be informed. In the course of 
enacting the new procedures, ministries must strengthen the link between strategic planning and 
monitoring of the EI process (both done by DEIPCs) and execution of transposition (co-ordinated by the 
legal departments). Second, practices in implementing normative standards of transposition are still limited. It is 
commendable that the MEI (in co-operation with GIZ) has prepared a practical manual on how to fulfil 
the tables, which should help the ministries to execute this new obligation; however, a prioritised 
approach is needed both to launching new transpositions rules and providing capacity building to 
ministries. Third, due to the limited number of people in the ministries who have a good knowledge of English (or 
any other EU official language), there is a lack of comprehension of the acquis (especially in the legal 
departments). Another crucial functional capacity which must be enhanced within the ministries in order to deliver the 
implementation goals the SAA process envisions, is forward budgetary planning. For example, in the 
2012 EPAP, the MESP had 14 laws to draft with a deadline of 2012, including the  " Law on Kosovo 
waters " , the  " Law on Nuclear Security and Protection from Radiation "  and  " Amending and 
Supplementing the Law on Chemicals " . The total financial impact of these 14 laws (which also included 
waste management) was estimated at EUR 5 000 51 . The reason for such a small sum is that only the cost 
of drafting the necessary bills (legal consultation, possible foreign expertise) was planned and thus linked 
with the budget, but the actual implementation costs were not. Although costs are generally foreseen in 
the second phase (after legislation has been promulgated and implementation measures are drafted), 
the lack of foresight in the legislative phase has hampered the ministries' ability to ensure proper funding 
for implementation. Many interviewees pointed to foreign assistance as the main source of funding, 
used by more enterprising ministries to ensure coverage of implementation costs for new legislation. 
This system, however, is not sustainable. The proper use of concept papers could be one way of 
enhancing forward planning in the ministries. 51 EPAP 2012, page 85. 48 3 
POLICY MAKING IN PARLIAMENT This chapter examines the role of the Assembly of Kosovo in policy making. The review is prepared with a 
number of assumptions about the role of parliaments in the policy process. First, parliaments have a 
positive contribution to make throughout all stages of the policy cycle, including: agenda-setting, policy 
formulation, decision-taking, implementation and evaluation, though the relative emphases vary. 
Second, the orientation towards enhancing the quality of public action and public policy affects not only 
the legislative process, but also other key functions, such as the budgetary process, parliamentary 
oversight and control over the executive, and parliamentary involvement in EU integration. Third, whilst 
the focus of this review is on the internal conditions shaping the impact of the Assembly on public policy 
making, this contribution is decisively influenced by the quality of interinstitutional relationships, most 
notably with the Government, but also with public sector institutions, civil society, and international 
bodies. Finally, a policy-focused analysis needs to focus on both political and administrative structures 
and procedures in Parliament. The following analysis focuses on areas seen as critical to parliamentary policy making. Whilst the review 
contains descriptive material, the emphasis is on highlighting potential bottlenecks within the 
parliamentary policy process. It should be noted that some of the points highlighted have also been 
raised in other documents, notably: the European Commission's Kosovo Analytical Report 2012, the 
Commission's Feasibility Study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and 
Kosovo 2012, the Joint Report to the European Parliament and the Council, on Kosovo's progress in 
addressing issues set out in the Council Conclusions of December 2012 in view of a possible decision on 
the opening of negotiations on the SAA of April 2013. 3.1 
Legal framework The normative framework that regulates the policy related powers of the Assembly consists of a range of 
sources, including, inter alia, the Constitution, notably its Chapter IV (Articles 63 to 82), and the RoP of 
the Assembly, including several annexes. Some committees, such as the Committee for Budget and 
Finance, have adopted additional RoP. A range of other laws also touch on individual aspects relevant to 
the policy making powers and capacity of the Parliament, such as: the Law on the Financing of Political 
Parties of 2010, amended and supplemented in 2011, which regulates, amongst other matters, the 
provision of funds for parliamentary party groups; legal acts that contain the reporting requirements of 
the public authorities and independent regulatory bodies to the Assembly; laws on financial 
management and accountability, which spell out the powers of the Assembly in the different stages of 
the budget process; and the Law on the Civil Service, which also applies to most Assembly staff. In sum, 
there exists a fairly differentiated legal framework with a clear hierarchy of norms. Moreover, the 
Assembly has adopted a number of  " manuals "  intended to set out the best procedural practices in a 
number of areas, including: the organisation of work in committees; the holding of committee hearings; 
the consultation of external experts in committees; and the exercise of the oversight and control 
functions at the committee level. Analysis of main challenges Although Kosovo is still in the early stages of its path towards the EU, it is worth considering the early 
adoption of a comprehensive legal framework that would set out the principles and practices governing 
executive-legislative relations in matters pertaining to EU integration. The Assembly's RoP regulate the 
powers of the Committee for European Integration, but they do not establish anything approaching a 
comprehensive framework for the effective parliamentarisation of the integration process. In any case, it 
is debatable what normative force the RoP possess vis-à-vis the Government and the President of 
Kosovo. This is in contrast to some EU Member States, such as Germany, with its Law on Co-operation 49 between the Federal Government and the German Bundestag in matters concerning the EU and the Law 
on Responsibility for Integration, or Denmark, where the Parliament has agreed on a series of legally 
binding reports with the Government on how to handle EU-related matters. 3.2 
Institutional framework The key elements of the institutional framework include: the Assembly's Presidency, the parliamentary 
party groups, the plenary, four parliamentary standing committees and nine functional committees, and 
the administration of the Assembly. 3.2.1 
Assembly Presidency The main political leadership structure is the Presidency, which consists of the President of the Assembly 
and five Vice Presidents. It is charged with planning and steering the work of the Assembly. The agendas 
of its meetings are publicly available and show that the Presidency is centrally concerned with arranging 
the flow of work for the plenary sessions. For this purpose, it also holds regular meetings with the heads 
of the parliamentary groups. Analysis of main challenges At least three points deserve highlighting. First, the President of the Assembly performs a political 
function rather than a primarily ceremonial function, as in some European parliaments. The President 
has his own cabinet, including a Chief of Cabinet, a senior political advisor, and advisers for information, 
legal matters, protocol and international relations, and economic affairs. Members of the President's 
cabinet are appointed by the President and do not belong to the civil service of the Assembly 
administration. Second, the Presidency, as a whole, is regarded as a political body. Thus, the total of 30 
staff currently working for the Presidency – including chauffeurs – are not subject to the civil service 
legislation that governs the employment of the administrative staff of the Assembly. Their employment 
is tied to the term of office of the Presidency. Third, as will be discussed below, meetings of the 
Presidency are not attended by a representative of the Government, although Article 16 of the RoP 
allows for such participation without voting rights. 3.2.2 
Parliamentary party groups As in any parliamentary system, the parliamentary party groups play a key role in structuring the work of 
the Assembly. There are currently eight parliamentary groups, ranging in size from 6 to 34 members. 
There are also six Deputies who do not belong to a group. Some of the groups contain members from 
several political parties, i.e. political parties and party groups are not identical. Analysis of main challenges For a number of reasons, it is difficult for the groups to promote the professionalisation and 
specialisation in the work of Deputies that is required to deal with the Assembly's complex tasks. Only 
the members of the Presidency, the heads of parliamentary groups and chairpersons of committees have 
their own offices at the seat of the Assembly, whereas other Deputies do not have access to dedicated 
office facilities or assistants. The parliamentary party groups themselves employ some advisory staff, but 
these serve primarily the leadership of the group. Six of the eight groups are small, with between 6 and 
12 members; only the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Democratic Party of Kosovo have 27 and 34 
members respectively. In the case of groups consisting of members of several parties, cohesion is low. It 
is also noteworthy that during the IVth Assembly, 17 elected Deputies have so far resigned their 
positions (for a variety of reasons, including the incompatibility of a parliamentary mandate and the 
Government office), adding further pressures to the policy making capacities of the groups. 50 3.2.3 
Plenary and committees The main working bodies of the Assembly include the plenary; four standing committees – the 
Committees for Budget and Finance; Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns; Legislation; and EI. 
There are also nine functional committees, dealing with: 1. Foreign Affairs; 2. Economic Development, 
Infrastructure and Industries; 3. Internal Affairs, Security and Supervision of the Kosovo Security Force; 4. 
Human Rights, Gender Equality, Missing Persons and Petitions; 5. Education, Culture, Youth, Sports, 
Public Administration, Local Government and Media; 6. Health, Labour and Social Welfare; 7. Agriculture, 
Forestry, Environment and Spatial Planning; 8. Oversight of the Kosovo Intelligence Agency, and 9. 
Oversight of Public Finances. There is also a sub-committee of the Standing Committee for Legislation 
dealing with mandates, immunities and the rules of the Assembly. Finally, as will be explained at greater 
length below, Assembly committees regularly form working groups to deal with individual bills. Each 
standing committee has a dedicated support staff of four members of the Assembly administration. The 
functional committees are normally served by two staff each. The meetings of both committees and 
working groups for the consideration of bills are invariably attended by committee staff. Analysis of main challenges An examination of the Assembly's workload underlines its character as a  " working parliament " . As Figure 
9 shows, there are weekly or biweekly plenary meetings during the two annual sessions and most 
committees also meet at least once a week during that time. Figure 9: Assembly workload 2011-2012 Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012. Figure 10 below indicates that the legislative workload of the Assembly is considerable. Legislation takes 
up most of the time of the working groups, which consider bills in detail prior to their second reading, 
and also makes up a large part of the agenda of committee meetings and sittings of the plenary. Plenary meetings

parliamentary support staff, notably the staff of the Division for Committee Support, devotes a large part 
of their time preparing, attending and following up meetings during the two annual sessions of the 
Assembly. As a consequence, time for other tasks, notably the detailed consideration of the reports of 
independent agencies and reviews of the implementation of laws, is scarce. 3.2.4 
Assembly administration The political structures are served by an Assembly administration, which is headed by the Secretary 
General. At the end of 2012, the Assembly had filled 168 posts of 180 approved budgeted positions. Of 
these, about two thirds, 109 staff, possessed a university level education; 96 were male, 72 female. The 
recruitment plan of the Assembly for 2013 envisages the hiring of 11 new staff in total, including a Senior 
Officer for Donor Co-ordination and Relations with Civil Society and two Senior Officers for Legislation in 
the Department for Legal Standardisation and Harmonisation. As already noted, there are also 30 staff 
working for the Presidency who operate outside the organisational structure of the main administration 
(with the exception of two administrative assistants). A number of temporary interns also work at the 
Assembly). Analysis of main challenges Several features of the Assembly administration merit further comment. First, it is notable that although 
the overall staff number is not high, there is a considerable degree of organisational differentiation. 
There is the Office of the Secretariat, the Department for Media and Public Relations, the Department 
for Protocol and International Relations, and the Department for Procurement. There are also two main 
General Departments – for Legal and Procedural Issues and for Administration – and nine departments 
that report to them. Most of these departments are further divided into units. The organisational set-up 
and associated job descriptions are based on acts of the Presidency. The current structure, with two 
General Departments and nine departments is of recent origin. It was devised in the spring of 2012 and 
became fully functional in the autumn of that year, and was accompanied by a rise in the number of Draft laws processed

several reasons for the growth in the number of departments: the desire to establish better direct 
communication between the Secretary-General and staff, and the aim of improving responsibility in the 
administration by increasing the number of managerial positions. It is worth considering the allocation of staff across different functions. At present, the General 
Department for Legal and Procedural Issues, with its four Departments for Plenary and Procedural Issues, 
Parliamentary Committees, Standardisation and Legislative Harmonisation, and Research, Archive and 
Library, employs merely a third of the overall Assembly staff. This means that direct support for the core 
bodies and functions of the Assembly takes up a third of personnel capacity, whilst more indirect 
 " backroom "  functions, such as procurement, IT, internal administration (budget and personnel), 
transport, mail and supplies take up the remainder of resources. Considering the heavy emphasis on 
legislative and oversight and control activities at the level of committees and working groups, the 
number of officials servicing committees and working groups, 36 at present, is small. There are also synergies in the work performed by the Committee for Legislation and its staff, on the one 
hand, and the Unit for Legal Standardisation and Approximation, with three Senior Officers, on the other. 
The Unit carries out an initial analysis of all bills prior to the first reading that focuses on the legal and 
formal aspects of bills, their structure, approximation with EU legislation, and contains recommendations 
regarding content, structure and legal-linguistic formulations, and remarks on the English and Serbian 
versions. The Unit is also in charge of dealing with the finalisation of bills after the amendment process. 
The Committee for Legislation also carries out a compliance assessment with domestic legislation, both 
in its capacity as a standing committee, and as a functional committee during the committee stage of the 
legislative process. The Assembly administration does not, thus far, possess autonomy from the Government when it comes 
to personnel policy and is subject to the same civil service legislation as the Government administration. 
Prior to 2010, special regulations were in place that governed employment in the Assembly. More 
critically, the ceiling of posts in the Assembly is set by the MoF, and recruitments require the prior 
approval of the MPA. Thus, the start of recruitment procedures and the setting of grades and pay scales 
can only happen with the Ministry's explicit authorisation. The dependency of the Assembly 
administration on ministerial consent in matters of staffing is problematic. More generally, it is worth 
recalling the comment in the 2012 Feasibility Study for a SAA between the EU and Kosovo that,  " The 
financial and administrative independence of the Assembly from the Government needs to be 
strengthened. This can be achieved through adopting legislation on the status of civil servants of the 
Assembly. It is also important to ensure that the draft budget of the Assembly is modified by the 
Government in consultation with the Assembly before the Government submits the budget proposal to 
the Assembly for adoption " . 3.3 
Key policy processes and instruments 3.3.1 
Managing parliamentary business and interinstitutional relationships As noted above, the key responsibility for managing parliamentary business lies with the President of the 
Assembly and the Presidency. One of their central tasks is to provide for effective timetabling of plenary 
meetings during the two annual sessions, and to ensure that the time rules governing the legislative 
process, the budgetary process and oversight and control procedures are adhered to. Timetabling of the 
individual plenary sittings is done in consultation with the heads of parliamentary groups. The planning 
of the work schedules of committees is decentralised. Committee chairpersons, working closely with 
committee staff, are decisive in this respect. Both the Assembly, as a whole, and each committee adopt 
an annual work plan. To a considerable extent, these work plans are reliant on the annual work plan of 
the Government which, among other things, sets out the bills to be submitted during the course of the 
year. For committees, a key question also to be decided is the allocation of committee time for oversight 53 and control, notably the organisation of field visits, oversight hearings, the consideration of annual 
reports from the ministries on the implementation of laws and the detailed scrutiny of the 
implementation of individual laws. In 2011, the Assembly committees considered in depth the 
implementation of 11 laws; in 2012 this dropped to 7 laws. Analysis of main challenges In the writing of this review, it was not possible to draw on data showing the percentage of the 
Government's annual legislative programme that materialises in the form of bills submitted to the 
Assembly. Nor was it possible to ascertain the percentage of the Government bills that had not 
previously been announced in the legislative programme. Thus, it is difficult to gauge the reliability of the 
legislative programme. The prevailing impression amongst interviewees was that the overall annual 
legislative workload was predictably high. However, problems of executive-legislative co-ordination affect the more detailed planning of 
parliamentary activities. As noted earlier, there is no Government representative present at the 
meetings of the Presidency, nor are there regular meetings at the level of the Secretary-General. There is 
little co-ordination amongst the ministries when it comes to the timing of the submission of bills to the 
Assembly. Thus, in 2011, 143 bills were expected to be submitted to the Assembly, but 49 were not 
processed within the initially foreseen deadline. As a result, work flows for the standing committees, in 
particular, can be very uneven. The lack of a key executive interlocutor, such as a Minister for Relations 
with Parliament, creates problems when it comes to ensuring that parliamentary questions are answered 
satisfactorily and on time. Thus, in 2012, out of the 160 parliamentary questions submitted for answering 
by the Prime Minister and ministers, a quarter, 43, remained without reply. 3.3.2 
Legislation The main rules governing the legislative process are contained in the Constitution and the Assembly's 
RoP. These rules specify both the institutions involved and the processes to be followed. The rules are 
clear and well understood by the legislators. The parliamentary legislative process normally encompasses 
two readings. In cases where a bill does not receive the sufficient number of votes for its adoption in the 
second reading, a third reading may take place upon the request of the sponsor of the bill. As is customary in parliamentary systems, the legislative calendar is dominated by Government bills. In 
2012, in addition to 15 bills carried over from 2011, the Assembly dealt with 70 Government bills, 
compared to just 4 bills submitted by committees and 3 bills sponsored by Deputies. In 2012, 69 bills 
became law. It is interesting that seven bills were returned to the Government for redrafting, up from 
two bills in 2011. Analysis of main challenges The practice of parliamentary scrutiny of bills cannot be understood without reference to the state of the 
legal system in Kosovo. It is generally recognised that many important elements of the legal system still 
need to be put in place. Unlike in the legal systems of fully consolidated democracies, where law making 
is often dominated by amendments to existing legislation, in Kosovo there is an emphasis on the 
adoption of genuinely new laws. Moreover, the adoption of this legislation is often foreseen as the result 
of international commitments entered into by the Government. This means that parliamentary influence 
on both substantive legislative priorities and legislative timetables is severely constrained. Parliamentary influence is further restricted by the fact that executive-legislative co-operation during the 
pre-parliamentary stages of the legislative process seems largely absent. There is no tradition of 
involving experts from the majority parliamentary groups informally in the drafting of bills by the 
ministries. Thus, Deputies can only try to exert influence once a bill has been submitted to the Assembly. Notwithstanding these systemic limitations to the impact of the Assembly on the content and timing of 
legislation, the Assembly is certainly taking its legislative role seriously, and devotes a considerable part 54 of its resources to the scrutiny of legislation. Bills are first considered by the relevant functional 
committee and a  " vote in principle "  is then taken in the plenary on whether to proceed. If a decision is 
taken to proceed in principle, the bill is then examined both by the relevant functional committee and 
the relevant standing committees. The functional committee may take up to three months for the 
consideration of a bill. Two standing committees – the Committee for Legislation and the Committee for 
EI – also examine all bills, and the two other standing committees – for Budget and Finance, and for 
Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns – will consider the bill if it falls into their sphere of 
responsibilities. Committees establish working groups of between three and five Deputies to examine bills and the 
number of meetings of working groups is high (see Figure 9 above). These working group meetings are 
usually attended by representatives of the ministry sponsoring the bill. Ministers typically attend the 
committee meeting at which the recommendations of the working groups are discussed. During the 
second reading of the bill, all amendments proposed are voted upon individually, including those of the 
lead functional committee, other committees, parliamentary groups, the Government and the Deputies. 
The fact that bills are invariably considered by more than one committee, and often by three or four, 
combined with extensive opportunities for proposing amendments to Government bills, encourages 
detailed legislative scrutiny. The number of proposed amendments is considerable, with 1 254 in 2011 and 1 002 in 2012. Between 
January and June 2013, a total of 781 amendments were proposed to 38 bills that were under 
consideration. Of the amendments proposed, approximately 98% are approved. Final voting on 
individual amendments and the bill as a whole takes place at the same plenary session. As a result, it can 
be very difficult to deal with potential discrepancies or even contradictions between amendments. The Assembly's RoP allows for consultation with those having affected interests and also permits the 
engagement of external experts. Committee agendas are made public well in advance of committee 
meetings. A manual to aid the use of external expertise in committees was produced in late 2011. 
Committees conducted 68 public hearings in 2011. In 2012, this number dropped to 37. This decline 
indicates time pressures in the legislative process, but also points to strains on the organisational 
capacities of committees. Standing committees have an annual budget of EUR 10 000 each to pay 
outside expert consultants. The equivalent figure in the case of functional committees is EUR 5 000 each. 
At least as regards legislation intensive committees, these figures are low, so that committees have 
repeatedly turned to external donors to finance expert advice. The short period of time – only 10 days – available to the standing committees on Budget and Finance, 
Legislation, Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns, and EI to consider amendments proposed by 
functional committees is problematic. In cases where there is a high number of amendments proposed, 
the standing committees find it difficult to carry out a proper assessment of the budgetary, legal and 
integration related aspects of amendments. 3.3.3 
Budgeting The main powers and responsibilities of the Assembly in matters relating to the state budget are laid 
down at the level of the Constitution, the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability and 
the Assembly's RoP. It is useful here to distinguish between the annual procedures for the adoption of 
the state budget, the consideration of the budgetary impact of bills, and the Assembly's role in oversight 
and control regarding the execution of the budget. In line with the terms of reference of this review, the 
focus is on the latter two issues. Whilst ultimate parliamentary authority in matters relating to the budget and public finances rests in the 
plenary, it is the Committee for Budget and Finance where most of the detailed work takes place. As a 
standing committee, this committee considers all bills with budgetary implications. As a functional 
committee, it reviews legislation relating to budgeting, finance and fiscal policy. The committee also 55 considers the unaudited reports of the public agencies that report to it. There is a separate Committee 
on Oversight of Public Finances that oversees the legality of public expenditure and works closely with 
the Office of the Auditor General. In considering legislation with budgetary implications as a standing committee, the Budget and Finance 
Committee operates under the same time rules that apply to other standing committees in the 
legislative process, i.e. it is asked to report on the bill within 10 days during the review stage for the 
detailed consideration of bills prior to the second reading. If, during this stage, other committees suggest 
amendments with budgetary implications, the Budget and Finance Committee is required to respond 
within five days. If the Committee serves as a functional committee, it has 15 days for reaching a position 
on the adoption or non-adoption of the bill in principle, and, after the conclusion of the first reading, two 
months to present a report with recommendations to the plenary (the Committee may ask the Assembly 
to grant up to one month's extension). Analysis of main challenges Like other committees, the Budget and Finance Committee establishes working groups for the 
consideration of bills, with between three and five Deputies. Participants in the process criticise the 
budgetary impact statements provided by the Government with draft bills as being at times incomplete 
and superficial, so that the working groups have to perform their tasks within a very short time in the 
case of standing committee matters, and on the basis of weak information. The working groups are 
served by the administrative committee staff. Prior to the meetings, committee staff prepare preliminary 
assessments on potentially problematic issues and, according to participants in the process, it is also 
committee personnel who formulate the bulk of suggested amendments. In the past few years, the 
committee administration benefitted from assistance by various international donors to upgrade its 
capacities. Regarding oversight and control, the Budget and Finance Committee plays a subsidiary role compared to 
the Committee on Oversight of Public Finances. It receives the unaudited financial reports of agencies 
and independent institutions. Committee staff provide preliminary analyses on this basis. It is not 
unusual for reports to be returned to the institutions with the request for further information. There are at least two issues worth highlighting when it comes to the Assembly's role in budget related 
policy making. First, its capacity for the scrutiny of bills is critically dependent on the quality of the 
budgetary and financial information accompanying bills that is provided by the Government. The Budget 
and Finance Committee does not have at its disposal the personnel or financial resources to carry out 
systematic assessments of budgetary impacts. It is, by necessity, largely confined to checking the quality 
of the information furnished by the executive. Second, as regards its oversight role, it is not clear whether the current practice of considering unaudited 
reports, whilst the Committee on Oversight of Public Finances deals with audit reports, is optimal. 3.3.4 
Oversight and control Compared to legislative work, the Assembly's activities in executive oversight and control are of a more 
limited scale. The chief instruments available include: parliamentary questions, interpellations leading to 
debates, examinations of the implementation of individual laws, and the consideration of reports from 
executive bodies (for further details see Manual  " Oversight Function of Parliamentary Committees " , 
2012). The range of oversight and control instruments available is quite limited and no intensive use is 
made of them (see Figure 11). Analysis of main challenges Parliamentary questions to the Prime Minister and ministers for oral answers during question time are 
regulated in Article 45 of the RoP. They must be submitted in writing at least 48 hours in advance, are 
then posed orally in no more than two minutes, and the answer must take no more than three minutes. 56 A Deputy is not allowed more than two such questions per plenary session. It is evident from these 
regulations that oral questions can do no more than raise very specific issues, rather than allow for a 
systematic questioning of the Executive. There was a modest increase in the number of parliamentary 
questions from 124 in 2011 to 160 in 2012. It is also possible to table questions for written answers 
(Article 46, RoP), but this instrument is hardly ever used. Motions of interpellation allow groups of at least six Deputies to request a debate on issues concerning 
the work of the Government or an individual ministry. The RoP (Article 44) require the Prime Minister or 
ministers to respond to the issues raised, and time is made available in the plenary to present the 
proposers' concern, for the executive to respond, and for other Deputies to join the debate. Although 
the interpellation seems a suitable instrument for executive oversight, only four motions of 
interpellations were debated in 2011 and 2012 each. Figure 11: Scrutiny activities of the Assembly 2011-2012 Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012. In addition to the oversight and control mechanisms employed at the level of the plenary, committees 
also play a role in holding the Executive to account. The terms of reference of parliamentary committees 
establish that they oversee the application of legislation falling within their respective spheres of 
competence. The Assembly has adopted a practice under Article 73 of the RoP whereby each committee 
should, in principle, aim to carry out an examination of the implementation of at least one major law per 
year. The relevant decisions are taken as part of the discussions held on the annual committee work 
plans. In 2011, 11 such examinations were carried out, and 7 were conducted in 2012. The provision 
applies to both standing committees and functional committees. Thus, for example, the Budget and 
Finance Committee intends to carry out two reviews in 2013, one on the Public Procurement Law and 
one on the Law on Fortune Games. The Assembly receives regular reports from budgetary organisations and independent institutions that 
operate within their sphere of competence. These reports are first discussed in committee and their 
review in the plenary is opened by a presentation from a committee rapporteur. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2010.8 2011 2011.2 2011.4 2011.6 2011.8 2012 2012.2 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 2011 
2012 Questions submitted Reviews of annual reports and 
audit reports Law implementation reviews Interpellations 57 It is notable that the Assembly does not make use of the Investigative Committees, as provided for in 
Article 71 of the RoP. Such committees can be established  " where the Assembly identifies an issue of 
special importance "  and wishes  " to summon any official it deems necessary to testify in front of the 
committee " . 3.3.5 
EU integration Parliamentary responsibility for matters relating to EI is concentrated in the standing Committee for 
European Integration. It reviews and supervises the process of harmonisation of laws enacted by the 
Assembly with the legislation of the EU. In practice, this means that all bills considered must be 
submitted to the committee which assesses the compatibility of bills with the acquis. The committee is 
also tasked with maintaining close working ties with the EU institutions, EU Member States and other 
actors relevant to the furtherance of Kosovo's integration process, and for monitoring and supervising 
the implementation of relevant agreements. The committee also deals with Kosovo's relationship with 
the Council of Europe. In addition to the working plan of the Committee, the Assembly as a whole adopts 
annual  " Parliamentary Action Plans for European Integration " , as well as regular progress reports on the 
implementation of these annual action plans. The Assembly receives six monthly reports from the 
Government on integration related developments. Analysis of main challenges Whilst it is evident that the Assembly attaches central importance to EI in its workings, there are several 
issues relating to the operation of the Committee for EI and interinstitutional relationships that merit 
further scrutiny. First, under the RoP, the Committee, as a standing committee, is only given 10 days to 
check for the compliance of bills with European legislation and agreements and the obligations arising 
out of Council of Europe membership. Participants in the process criticise that the declarations of 
compliance accompanying Government bills cannot always be relied upon and that no proper tables of 
compliance are provided. In practice, the compatibility checks of bills – and also amendments introduced 
during the legislative process – fall to two of the total of four committee staff. As a consequence, in an 
area where attention to legislative details is essential, time pressures are especially severe. Given the overall scarcity of resources in the Assembly, including legal expertise, it seems justified to look 
again at the division of labour amongst the Committee for Legislation and the Committee for EI and their 
respective personnel, as well as the Unit for Legal Harmonisation and Approximation. Both committees 
and their staff engage primarily in the scrutiny of compliance, with domestic and European law 
respectively, as does the Unit. There seems at least an obvious case for concentrating these legal checks 
into a single body served by an enlarged administrative support structure that incorporates the above 
Unit. In addition, an artificial division appears to exist between the political responsibilities of the Committee 
for European Integration, on the one hand, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the other, given 
the overriding importance of the European frameworks for co-operation in Kosovo's foreign relations. 
This division at the level of the Assembly mirrors the organisational division between the Ministry of EI 
and the MFA at the level of the Government. As noted above, there is, as yet, no comprehensive legal framework governing the powers and 
responsibilities of the Assembly in the EU integration process. In addition, the EI Committee's role is 
principally geared towards review and co-ordination rather than the initiation and formulation of 
political initiatives, and towards sustaining a critical dialogue with the Government and the President in 
the integration process. In particular, at present, the EI Committee and the Assembly as a whole are 
largely bystanders in the negotiations with the EU. Thus far, there has been no requirement for the 
Assembly's approval of the mandates of SAA negotiations and no discussion of commitments taken by 
the Government prior to their adoption. 58 THE SIGMA PROGRAMME SIGMA (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management) is a joint initiative of the OECD and
