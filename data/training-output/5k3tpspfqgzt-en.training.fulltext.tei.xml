			<head>The Swedish Tax on<lb/> Nitrogen Oxide Emissions<lb/> Lessons in Environmental Policy Reform<lb/> KEY FINDINGS<lb/> The problem<lb/></head>

			<p>Sweden was facing a serious soil acidification and water eutrophication problem caused partly<lb/> by emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) from combustion processes in transport, industry and<lb/> power.<lb/></p>

			<head>The policy response<lb/></head>

			<p>In 1992, Sweden introduced a high tax on NO x emissions from large combustion sources (e.g.<lb/> power plants, industrial plants, waste incinerators). The tax was accompanied by a refund<lb/> according to the amount of energy generated. This ensures that facilities with low NO x emission<lb/> intensitites are net beneficiaries of the scheme. Continuous monitoring of emissions was also<lb/> made mandatory. The tax was designed to accelerate and stimulate investment in advanced<lb/> combustion and pollution-abatement technologies and as a supplement to existing regulatory<lb/> measures.<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact<lb/></head>

			<p>A 35% reduction in NO x emissions from facilities covered by the tax within 20 months after<lb/> the implementation of the tax; industry was encouraged to develop cheaper, more efficient<lb/> technologies; and emission intensities of energy production have been cut by half.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key messages<lb/></head>

			<p>A high emission tax rate can be made politically acceptable by:</p>

			<p>(1) refunding revenues earned<lb/> back to the firms affected; and (2) ensuring the policy is well designed.<lb/></p>

			<head>The environmental problem<lb/></head>

			<p>Soil acidification has been a major political issue in Sweden since the 1980s. With its already<lb/> naturally acidic soil, Sweden is more sensitive to acid deposition than most other countries.<lb/> It is therefore one of the countries that has been most affected by acid rain, causing negative<lb/> impacts to lake and forest ecosystems.<lb/> One of the families of gases contributing to acid rain is nitrogen oxides (NO x ): a term used to<lb/> cover nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). These gases are produced from a reaction<lb/> between nitrogen and oxygen in the air during combustion, especially at high temperatures –<lb/> such as in engines or power station boilers. NO x emissions form nitric acid when dissolved in<lb/> atmospheric moisture, and this is a component of acid rain (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). 1 In addition, nitrogen<lb/> oxides contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), which has adverse effects on<lb/> vegetation and human health (respiratory and cardiovascular problems).<lb/> Sweden has taken an aggressive – and largely successful – approach to tackling all the<lb/> pollutants produced within its borders which contribute to acid rain (mainly sulphur and<lb/> nitrogen). 2 This case study describes the approach taken to reduce NO x emissions from<lb/> combustion plants, the challenges encountered and the social, environmental and economic<lb/> impacts. It concludes by discussing the wider lessons that are raised for other governments<lb/> seeking to develop similar policy responses.<lb/></p>

			<p>The policy challenge:<lb/></p>

			<head>Curbing NO x emissions in Sweden<lb/></head>

			<p>The strong political attention given to environmental problems caused by NO x emissions<lb/> prompted the Swedish Parliament to adopt a strategy in 1985 to reduce overall domestic<lb/> NO x emissions by 30% by 1995, compared to 1980 levels. The law on environmental<lb/> protection established NO x emission limits as of 1988 for stationary 3 combustion plants<lb/> using permits that were non-tradable. However, it soon became clear that these limits<lb/> would not reduce emissions quickly enough, and in addition the guidelines for how<lb/> the permits ought to be formulated were not legally binding. The question was how to<lb/> achieve these large reductions cost effectively and without damaging the competitive<lb/> basis of the industries involved.<lb/> The Swedish Environmental Charges Commission was set up in the late 1980s, tasked<lb/> with designing effective policies to tackle a range of environmental problems (Box 1).<lb/> They consulted widely in order to design a politically feasible solution which addressed a<lb/> number of challenges. The policy chosen for reducing NO x from combustion plants was<lb/> influenced by a number of factors:<lb/> •<lb/> Unlike CO 2 and SO 2 emissions, which depend to a large extent on the carbon<lb/> and sulphur content of the fuels combusted, most NO x emissions are<lb/> produced through reactions with nitrogen present in the air (Box 2). This<lb/> means that while it is possible to tax the carbon and sulphur content of fuels<lb/> to limit CO 2 and SO 2 emissions, other means are needed to tackle NO x<lb/> emissions, and emissions will vary significantly depending on the combustion<lb/> technology employed and the maintenance of the combustion equipment<lb/> (Box 2) (<ref type="biblio">Sterner and Höglund-Isaksson, 2006</ref>).<lb/> •<lb/> The costs of reducing NO x emissions vary significantly across producers, and<lb/> economies of scale and rapid development meant that the flexibility of a<lb/> market-based instrument was needed.<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/></head>

			<p>3. Stationary or point sources of emissions are usually plants or facilities, while mobile sources of emissions generally refer to vehicles.<lb/></p>

			<head>•<lb/></head>

			<p>To be an effective deterrent, a high tax rate was needed, but there was likely<lb/> to be much opposition and lobbying against it by the affected industries;<lb/> there was also a concern that it would put Swedish firms at a competitive<lb/> disadvantage compared to foreign producers.<lb/> •<lb/> Given the complexities of NO x formation, it is crucial to have direct,<lb/> continuous monitoring at the plant in order to assess emissions (Box 2). This<lb/> can be expensive for smaller plants. A tax on all point sources of airborne NO x<lb/> emissions was not feasible because monitoring was too expensive for small<lb/> units. 4 But if small units were exempted because of the high monitoring cost,<lb/> then a high tax levied only on large units could have perverse effects,<lb/> favouring the operation of small, and usually less efficient units over big ones<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Sterner and Höglund-Isaksson, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2. THE POLICY CHALLENGE<lb/></head>

			<table>4. It was estimated that continuous measuring of NO x emissions would cost each plant about SEK 350 000 (about EUR 37 000) every year.<lb/> These high costs made it necessary to limit the tax to relatively large plants. The very largest energy producers were, however, already obliged<lb/> to have equipment for continuous emission measurements installed, so the NO x tax did not imply any additional measurement costs.<lb/> Box 1 | Policy by design: the Swedish Environmental Charges Commission<lb/> The Environmental Charges Commission (ECC) was appointed in 1987 and its reports resulted in the<lb/> introduction of a number of new economic instruments as part of Swedish environmental policy (SOU,<lb/> 1989). The ECC included representatives from all parliamentary parties, the most relevant ministries, and<lb/> civil society. The ECC&apos;s proposal for the tax on NO x emissions was presented for broad public consultation,<lb/> and a large number of public and private stakeholders expressed their views, mainly in support of the main<lb/> lines of the proposal. The commission also proposed several other economic instruments, including CO 2<lb/> and SO 2 taxes.<lb/> 6 | OECD ENVIRONMENT POLICY PAPER NO. 2 © OECD 2013<lb/> The design solution: the Swedish NO x emissions tax and refund system<lb/> The policy, voted in by the Swedish Parliament on 1 January 1992, was to impose a high<lb/> tax on emissions of nitrogen oxides from energy generation at combustion plants. The<lb/> tax 5 was set at a rate of 40 SEK 6 for every kilogramme of NO x emitted from any stationary<lb/> combustion plant producing at least 50 megawatt hours (MWh) of useful 7 energy per<lb/> year. This corresponds to 6 000 USD/tonne, much higher than the hundreds of dollars<lb/> usual in the US programmes for NO x permits (Sterner and Höglund-Isaksson, 2006).<lb/> The most innovative feature of this tax, however, was that all the revenue raised (except<lb/> administration costs) 8 would be returned to the participating plants in proportion to<lb/> their production of useful energy. This means that firms emitting low volumes of NO x<lb/> per unit of energy produced are net beneficiaries of the scheme – only firms with large<lb/> NO x emissions per energy unit are net tax payers. This feature of the system encourages<lb/> the targeted plants to reduce their emissions of nitrogen oxides per unit of energy to<lb/> the lowest possible level and avoids distorting the pattern of competition between those<lb/> plants subject to the NO x tax and those that are not (SEPA, 2006). Another important<lb/> feature of the tax was that it was based on mandatory continuous monitoring of<lb/> emissions.<lb/></table>

			<p>Initially, about 200 plants producing more than 50 GWh of usable energy per year were<lb/> regulated by this tax. In the following three years, average emissions per unit of useful<lb/> energy produced fell by 40% among these plants. Its effectiveness, coupled with falling<lb/> monitoring costs, led to extensions of the system, first in 1996 to about 270 plants<lb/> producing at least 40 MWh of useful energy per year; and then from 1997 onwards,<lb/> to about 400 plants producing at least 25 MWh of useful energy per year. 9 Today, all<lb/> stationary combustion plants producing more than 25 MWh – whether for power and<lb/> heat production, chemical production, waste incineration, metal manufacturing, pulp<lb/> and paper, food and wood industry – are subject to the NO x tax.<lb/> THE SWEDISH TAX ON NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS: LESSONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY REFORM<lb/> 5. This levy is often referred to as a &quot; charge &quot; , but according to OECD definitions, it is actually a tax; i.e. an &quot; unrequited payment to general<lb/> government &quot; (OECD Glossary of Tax Terms, available at www.oecd.org/ctp/glossaryoftaxterms.htm).<lb/></p>

			<figure>6. This tax rate was based on an estimate of the marginal costs of abatement measures that were expected to trigger an emission reduction of<lb/> some 5 000-7 000 tonnes NO x per year – the amount necessary to reduce NO x emissions by 30% between 1980 and 1995.<lb/></figure>

			<p>7. &quot; Useful energy produced &quot; has been accepted as a relevant and neutral yardstick for measuring output from this heterogeneous group of<lb/> industries since the main goal is to affect combustion technologies. For power plants and district heating plants it is equal to the energy sold.<lb/> For other industries, the energy is defined as steam, hot water or electricity produced in the boiler and used in production processes or heating<lb/> of factory buildings (<ref type="biblio">Sterner and Höglund-Isaksson, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 8. SEPA, the administrator of the scheme, stated that the administrative costs were about 0.7% of the total tax revenue (SEPA, 2003).<lb/></p>

			<head>9. The EU Directive on Large Combustion Plants</head>

			<table>specifies emission limits for several air pollutants and a requirement to continuously monitor<lb/> concentrations of SO 2 , dust and NO x in flue gases. All combustion plants with a thermal input of more than 100 MW have been subject to<lb/> continuous emission monitoring since November 2002. For Sweden, the Directive has no real implications for NO x emissions since most plants<lb/> affected are already regulated by the NO x tax.<lb/> OECD ENVIRONMENT POLICY PAPER NO. 2 © OECD 2013 | 7<lb/> Box 2 | What causes NO x emissions?<lb/></table>

			<p>Combustion uses fuel to produce heat. Heat extraction and conversion are the primary functions of<lb/> combustion units. It is during these steps that the energy is converted into a useful form: piped steam, hot<lb/> water, hot oil, and/or electricity. Heat requires fuel and an oxidising agent, generally air. Fuel and air are<lb/> fed, mixed and fired to create a flame, which is propagated throughout the combustion chamber, whose<lb/> shape, size and materials all can affect NO x formation and overall efficiency. A conflict may appear between<lb/> energy-efficiency and NO x formation, as one way of increasing combustion efficiency is to raise temperature<lb/> and pressure, which considerably increases the formation of</p>

			<table>NO x . Fluidised bed combustors partly<lb/> overcome this limitation and allow simultaneous efficiency gains and cleaner flue gases. The relationship<lb/> between combustion parameters and NO x formation is highly non-linear and complex. The exhaust<lb/> gases leave the combustion chamber and may go to post-combustion processes intended to reduce air<lb/> pollutants (e.g., NO x , SO 2 , CO and PM). These pollutants can be transformed, precipitated and washed in<lb/> liquids or deposited as sludge, depending on their nature and concentrations.<lb/></table>

			<p>The cement and lime industry, coke production, and much of the mining industry,<lb/> refineries, blast-furnaces, glass and isolation material industry, wood board production<lb/> and processing of biofuels are exempt from the tax, due to concerns about unfeasibly<lb/> high costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>From 1 January 2008, the tax rate was increased to SEK 50 (EUR 5.5) per kg of NO x , partly<lb/> in order to maintain a strong abatement incentive. In 1992, the first year the tax applied,<lb/> the total revenues were SEK 612 million (SEPA, 2003). In 2011 they amounted to SEK 794<lb/> million – about EUR 88 million.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reducing emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>In 1980, total emissions of NO x in Sweden amounted to about 450 kilotonnes. By 2000<lb/> they had fallen to just over 240 kilotonnes (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The NO x tax is aimed at a relatively<lb/> small proportion of Sweden&apos;s total NO x emissions, given that in 2000, 54% of emissions<lb/> were from the transport sector, which is not covered by the tax. But while emissions from<lb/> transport were reduced by about 13% between 1980 and 1997, emissions from stationary<lb/> sources were reduced by over 50% on average (<ref type="biblio">Statistics Sweden, 1998</ref>, cited in UCD,<lb/> 2008). Between 1992 and 2000, total NO x emissions from all sources decreased by 23%<lb/> (Figure 3).<lb/> Source: SEPA (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency) (2003), Kväveoxidavgiften – ett effektivt styrmedel.<lb/> Utvärdering av NO x -avgiften (Reducing NO x Emissions.

From 1992 to 2010, NO x emissions per unit of energy produced<lb/> fell by more than 50% (the red line in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The figure also shows how the combined<lb/> NO x emissions from all the plants covered by the tax remained relatively stable over this<lb/> period, even though the amount of energy produced by these plants more than doubled<lb/> – partly because of the lowering of the threshold for tax inclusion mentioned above,<lb/> meaning that more firms became covered by the tax.<lb/></p>

			<p>The management and the operators at the plants have become more focused on reducing<lb/> NO x . At one plant the operators are given a salary bonus if NO x emissions are low (IISD,<lb/> undated). The tax seems to have been more effective in reducing emissions intensity than<lb/> the overlapping regulatory emission standards. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows that by 2001, not only<lb/> had all the plants complied with their emission limits, 10 but the NO x tax appears to have<lb/> provided strong incentives for most of the surveyed plants to lower emission intensities<lb/> well below the limits of the quantitative standards. 11 This is based on information<lb/> collected by SEPA (2003) on emission standards and actual emission intensities for 73<lb/> plants that were regulated by the NO x tax both in 1997 and 2001. The actual emission<lb/> intensity levels were on average 40% below the limits specified by the quantitative<lb/> standards for these plants. Also, actual emission intensities for plants with very generous<lb/> standards were comparable with emission intensities in plants with considerably stricter<lb/> limits (OECD, 2010a).<lb/> 10. Forty per cent of all firms included in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> had a permit to emit 100 mg NO x for every megajoule (MJ) of energy they produced.<lb/> 11. The emission intensity is the average emission rate of a given pollutant from a given source relative to the intensity of a specific activity; for<lb/> example milligrams of NO x released per megajoule of energy produced.<lb/></p>

A large number of boilers are also subject to specific regulations stipulated in the<lb/> plants&apos; operating permits under the Environmental Code (SEPA, 2006). They must also comply<lb/> with parallel quantitative standards both for NO X and other pollutants, and emissions may<lb/> also have fallen through cost-effectiveness activities unrelated to NO X reduction (Sterner and<lb/> Höglund, 2005).<lb/> Lena Höglund-Isaksson and Thomas Sterner analysed 626 combustion plants that were<lb/> regulated by the NO X tax for at least one year between 1992 and 2007 (OECD, 2010a). In<lb/> Figure 7, the plants have been plotted in order of increasing emission intensities against the<lb/> cumulative energy output of the plants. This illustrates how emission intensities in later years<lb/> are considerably lower than in 1992 when the tax was introduced. For example, in 1992, the<lb/> plants were producing 3 000 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy while emitting around 550 kg<lb/> NO X per GWh. Sixteen years later, in 2007, the plants were able to produce the same amount<lb/> of energy while emitting less than 181 kg NO X per GWh – an improvement of 67%. There are<lb/> three main explanations for this:<lb/> •<lb/> Cumulative energy output produced by the plants increased by 74% over the<lb/> period. The expansion in output mostly took place in plants that were relatively<lb/> emission-efficient.<lb/> •<lb/> Regulated plants invested in NO x mitigation and were therefore able to produce<lb/> more energy output with fewer emissions.<lb/> •<lb/> Innovations in mitigation technology made it possible to reach even lower emission<lb/> intensity levels for the same output level.<lb/> Some of these explanations are explored further below.<lb/> Stimulating innovation<lb/> The design of the Swedish NO x tax has stimulated demand for new technologies. It has<lb/> done so through: (1) the refund system, which promotes competition to achieve the lowest<lb/> NO x emissions per unit of energy produced; and (2) its requirement to install equipment<lb/> to monitor NO x emissions on a continuous basis. This has driven demand for several new<lb/> technologies for pre-combustion, combustion, post-combustion and monitoring, as well as<lb/> energy efficiency (OECD, 2010a).<lb/> Box 4 | Promoting innovation through carbon pricing<lb/> The impact of the tax on innovations for reducing NO x emissions has been studied by the<lb/> OECD (OECD, 2010a and 2010b). In 1992 – the year the tax was introduced – only 7% of the<lb/> plants subject to the NO x tax reported to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency<lb/> (SEPA) that they had NO x abatement technologies installed. A year later, 62% of plants<lb/> reported having some kind of NO x abatement technology installed, and this share increased<lb/> to 72% in 1995. An analysis of patents lodged for<lb/> combustion and post-combustion technology<lb/> shows that in Sweden there appears to have<lb/> been continuous activity in this field since 1988,<lb/> especially between 1988 and 1993. The intense<lb/> activity during this particular period coincides<lb/> with the introduction of quantitative standards<lb/> for NO x in 1988 and the NO x charge in 1992.<lb/> Figure 7 | How emission intensity has improved in plants covered by the NO x tax<lb/> Source: SEPA (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency) (2008), Database of Information from Annual Surveys of<lb/> Plants Regulated by the Swedish NO x Charge, SEPA, Östersund.<lb/> 0<lb/> 200<lb/> 400<lb/> 600<lb/> 800<lb/> 1 000<lb/> 1 200<lb/> 1 400<lb/> 1 600<lb/> 1 800<lb/> 0<lb/> 1 000<lb/> 2 000<lb/> 3 000<lb/> 4 000<lb/> 5 000<lb/> 6 000<lb/> Emission intensity (kg NOx per GWh)<lb/></table>

			<head>3. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS<lb/> &quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>14 | OECD ENVIRONMENT POLICY PAPER NO. 2 © OECD 2013<lb/> THE SWEDISH TAX ON NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS: LESSONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY REFORM<lb/> In a survey of plants included in the first five years of the tax, Höglund-Isaksson<lb/> (2005) found that the adoption of NO x control technologies was a combined effect<lb/> of the tax and the individual emission standards that the plants had been subject<lb/> to since 1988. She found that out of 162 NO x -reducing measures undertaken, 47%<lb/> would not have been implemented without the introduction of the tax, 22% were<lb/> undertaken primarily to meet the quantitative standards, and 31% primarily for<lb/> other reasons, e.g. improved cost-effectiveness (unrelated to NO x reductions) or<lb/> compliance with emission standards for other pollutants than NO x (predominantly<lb/> SO 2 ). Thus, the NO x tax appears to have been the most important, but not the only,<lb/> factor for NO x abatement adoption during this first phase of the NO x tax and refund<lb/> system.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, while the NO x tax clearly stimulated innovation, a regulated firm&apos;s<lb/> willingness to share innovations with other regulated plants is hampered by the<lb/> refund system, since a spread of the innovation to other regulated firms will reduce<lb/> the innovating firm&apos;s own tax refund. On the other hand, for firms producing NO x<lb/> emission abatement equipment – who are not themselves directly affected by the<lb/> NO x tax – there are no such obstacles.<lb/></p>

			<head>Economic impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>The net winners and losers among the firms in<lb/> the different industrial sectors covered by the<lb/> tax in 2010 are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Each<lb/> vertical bar in the graph represents a separate<lb/> firm. The bars showing positive values represent<lb/> firms that receive more in refund than what<lb/> they paid in taxes – the &quot; winners &quot; in the system. While there are &quot; winners &quot; and<lb/> &quot; losers &quot; in all sectors, the &quot; losers &quot; are largely from the pulp-and paper 12 and wood<lb/> industry – but the net tax payments per firm are relatively modest. There are a few<lb/> large &quot; winners &quot; in the combined heat and power generation sector – with one plant<lb/> receiving about SEK 27 million, or more than EUR 3 million in net refund.<lb/></p>

			<p>The introduction of the tax revealed<lb/> abatement opportunities to pick the<lb/> &quot; low-hanging fruit &quot; .<lb/> 12. Possibly for this reason, the pulp and paper sector at one stage suggested that the refund system should be changed, in such a way that<lb/> each sector received a refund equal to the total tax payments from that sector (with a deduction for administrative costs). This proposal was,<lb/> however, not adopted.<lb/> &quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>3. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS<lb/> Costs of emission reduction for affected facilities<lb/></head>

			<p>According to SEPA (2006), comparatively large NO x emission reductions have been<lb/> possible at zero or very low cost. In 1996, the average cost of measures to reduce<lb/> emissions as a result of the NO x tax was SEK 7.5 (about EUR 0.8) per kg of reduced<lb/> NO x . Reduced emissions at zero cost or even at a profit were reported for about 30%<lb/> of boilers. One reason for this may be that the implementation of NO x abatement<lb/> measures has often been preceded by thorough scrutiny of the boilers and their<lb/> functions, highlighting opportunities for efficiency-improving and cost-saving<lb/> measures. The NO x tax has also increased knowledge of abatement measures (SEPA,<lb/> 2006).<lb/></p>

			<p>Emission intensity in kg NOx per <ref type="biblio">GWh<lb/> 1991<lb/> 1992<lb/> 1994<lb/> 1996<lb/></ref> Analysis of 114 plants regulated between 1992 and 1996 found that the emission<lb/> intensity attainable at no extra cost decreased from 557 kg per GWh in 1991 to about<lb/> 300 kg per GWh in 1996 (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>; Höglund <ref type="biblio">Isaksson, 2005</ref>). This shift likely comes<lb/> from adoption of innovations in abatement technology, which made it possible to<lb/> produce energy with less NO x emissions but without increasing costs. To a large<lb/> extent, the effects are referred to as trimming activities. Some of these opportunities<lb/> also existed before the introduction of the tax; however, the tax&apos;s requirement to<lb/> measure NO x emissions continuously made it possible for the firms to discover and<lb/> develop them to attain even lower emission intensity levels.<lb/></p>

			<p>The figure also shows that for a firm with an emission intensity of 200 kg of NO x per<lb/> GWh in 1991, the cost of reducing emissions by one kg (i.e. the marginal abatement<lb/> cost) was close to SEK 130 (about EUR 13.5). In 1996, this cost had fallen to less than<lb/> SEK 20.<lb/></p>

			<head>Competitiveness impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned above, the significant costs involved in continuous monitoring of NO x<lb/> emissions meant that authorities had to set an energy production threshold below<lb/> which a firm was exempted from the tax. This was deemed to be important for the<lb/> competitiveness of district heating compared to individual heating in homes and<lb/> offices. This has been addressed by the refund system already described, but also<lb/> by reducing the threshold value twice, from originally 50 MWh of useful energy per<lb/> year to 25 MWh of useful energy per year – partly in response to the development<lb/> of cheaper measurement technologies. The lower the threshold, the broader the<lb/> coverage of the tax – and the smaller the competitiveness problems in relation to<lb/> firms that are not covered.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>Due to the refund mechanism, there was hardly any net cost increase for industry, and<lb/> hence virtually no impacts on product prices. This in turn meant that there is no negative<lb/> income distribution impact from the scheme.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, this is also one of the disadvantages of a refunded tax: by having little impact<lb/> on the relative prices of products whose production involved high emissions, it does not<lb/> discourage demand for such products. 13 For the same reasons, it would be very difficult to<lb/> achieve a fundamental decarbonisation of the economy if one only were to rely on taxes<lb/> where for example electricity generators and other industries had their tax payments<lb/> refunded in one way or another.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main drawback with refunding is that it preserves an already distorted resource<lb/> allocation. The refund resembles a subsidy from society to the producers. Polluters do<lb/> not pay the full environmental cost of the pollution their production causes. This leads<lb/> to a welfare loss to society since too much productive resources are allocated to polluting<lb/> production relative to cleaner production. Hence, the polluter pays principle does not<lb/> apply when emission charges are refunded to polluters (OECD, 2010a).<lb/> 13. The tax and refund system applied in Sweden is very close in its impacts to an emission trading system with free allocation of permits,<lb/> based on current output levels.</p>

			<head>Comparison with other countries<lb/></head>

			<p>How does the environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency<lb/> of the Swedish NO x tax compare with policy instruments applied in other countries?<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows how much NO x was emitted per unit of electricity and heat produced by<lb/> fuel combustion 14 in electricity generation and industry across OECD countries in 1995<lb/> and 2000 compared to 1990 levels. Sweden performs well in comparison to most OECD<lb/> countries, especially when considering that the country&apos;s emissions per energy unit at<lb/> the outset were already among the lowest. 15 Even starting from a strong position, the NO x<lb/> emissions per unit energy produced in 2000 were 40% of their 1990 levels.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. The comparison only includes electricity and heat produced by combusting fuels. Hence, electricity generated by hydro power or in nuclear<lb/> power plants is excluded – as this would not generate any NO x emissions.<lb/> 15. A country like the Czech Republic started out with several times the NO x emissions per energy units produced of Sweden, as their emission<lb/> reductions across the 1990s were facilitated by the major economic restructuring the country went through in those years.<lb/></p>

			<table>| OECD ENVIRONMENT POLICY PAPER NO. 2 © OECD 2013<lb/> THE SWEDISH TAX ON NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS: LESSONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY REFORM<lb/> Box 3 | What do other countries do?<lb/> In 2007 and 2010, Norway and Denmark introduced taxes on NO x emissions at rates of EUR 2.1 and EUR<lb/> 0.7 per kg NO x respectively. These had a broader sectoral coverage than in Sweden, but did not include a<lb/> refund system. The Danish tax rate was increased to EUR 3.4 per kg NO x in July 2012. The tax rate applied<lb/> in Norway is based on an estimate of the value of the damage caused by one kg of NO x emitted. However,<lb/> strong industry opposition in Norway has led to exemptions for emission sources covered by environmental<lb/> agreements with the state concerning the implementation of measures to reduce NO x in accordance with<lb/> a predetermined environmental target. Taxes on NO x emissions have also been introduced in several other<lb/> countries – such as France, Italy and Galicia in Spain – but in most cases, the tax rates are quite modest.<lb/> The French tax on NO x emissions was introduced in 1990 as part of a combined package to reduce<lb/> emissions of the air pollutants SO 2 , NO x and VOC from large combustion plants. Revenues from the charge<lb/> were destined to subsidise investments in abatement technology in regulated plants and for research and<lb/> development of abatement technology. Due to concerns about distortions in competitiveness, the tax rate<lb/> was set very low – about 1% of the Swedish NO x charge. There was also no requirement for continuous<lb/> monitoring of emissions. Both factors are mentioned by Millock, Nauges and Sterner as important<lb/> explanations for why the French NO x tax did not have any measured effect on NO x emissions (cited in<lb/> OECD, 2010a).<lb/></table>

			<p>What is lacking in the comparison is information about the costs of the different policy<lb/> measures. Unfortunately, the data necessary for a comprehensive comparison over<lb/> the relevant years are not available, although there are some data for a few European<lb/> countries (Box 3).<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons learned<lb/></head>

			<p>The Swedish case demonstrates clearly that well-designed economic instruments<lb/> that provide significant economic abatement incentives can trigger important<lb/> environmental improvements. It also demonstrates that such instruments can strongly<lb/> encourage innovation – which helps to lower the costs over time of achieving ambitious<lb/> environmental policy objectives. Lessons with wider applicability include:<lb/> •<lb/> A high emissions tax rate can be<lb/> made politically acceptable by<lb/> refunding the money earned back<lb/> to the sector: this strongly reduces<lb/> the total cost to the affected<lb/> polluters and hence the resources<lb/> they will expend on lobbying<lb/> to stop or lower the charge (<ref type="biblio">Sterner<lb/> and Höglund, 2006</ref>). The decision to<lb/> exclude smaller plants was based partly<lb/> on the high costs of metering which (together with abatement costs) were<lb/> considered unreasonable for smaller plants. If a tax without refunds had<lb/> been applied to only a subsection of some industry then this would have been<lb/> unfair compared to other firms in the same industry. In this case, if the tax<lb/> were applied only to the large plants, companies would have an incentive to<lb/> set up several small combustion plants instead of one big one and this is<lb/> typically not desirable (from any viewpoint including emissions of NO x and<lb/> other pollutants).<lb/> •<lb/> Well-focussed environmental information to the public at large can play an<lb/> important role. The introduction of the tax was also most likely helped by<lb/> the good understanding by many Swedes of the environmental damage caused<lb/> by NO x emissions and of the potential benefits of using economic policy<lb/> instruments in environmental policy.<lb/> •<lb/> A policy designed with the involvement of all parliamentary parties – as was<lb/> the case with Sweden&apos;s Environmental Charges Commission – is likely to<lb/> contribute to broad support.<lb/></p>

			<p>With less resistance from polluters it<lb/> becomes politically easier to set<lb/> environmental taxes that are high enough<lb/> to generate substantial environmental<lb/> improvements.<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Continuous (and correct) measurement of emissions is important for bringing<lb/> attention to low-cost emission reductions that can be achieved simply by<lb/> &quot; trimming &quot; production processes. In a number of countries, continuous<lb/> measurement of a broad spectrum of pollutant emissions is now compulsory<lb/> for many sources. This could form the basis for the more widespread use of<lb/> economic instruments.<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Measures to abate NO x emissions can increase emissions of other pollutants,<lb/> such as CO, VOC, N 2 O and NH 3 . This phenomenon is not due to the use of a<lb/> tax instrument as such, but could occur as a result of any measure taken<lb/> in response to almost any type of policy instrument. While possible increases<lb/> in other emissions in principle could be addressed via a number of policy<lb/> instruments, a promising and consistent alternative would be to introduce a<lb/> &quot; price &quot; on each of the linked pollutants, reflecting their relative damage to<lb/> society.<lb/> This is one of the few OECD examples of a tax or charge that is refunded directly in this<lb/> way, and offers an interesting alternative to permits, particularly when the regulator<lb/> wants a price-type instrument but does not want to place the full cost burden on the<lb/> polluters. For a small open economy in which trade-sensitivity is an issue, refunding<lb/> makes political sense (<ref type="biblio">Sterner and Höglund-Isaksson, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>
